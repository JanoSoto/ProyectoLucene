[{"Title":"United States of Kiss My Ass","Date":"5 May 2004","Score":"52 out of 77 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  `The United States of Kiss My Ass'House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime.The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10  "},{"Title":"The Con Never Ends In House Of Games","Date":"15 August 2000","Score":"49 out of 80 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  	David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games,' a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game.  Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, 'Driven.'  Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability.  When a patient, Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf.  This takes her to the `House of Games,' a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world.  Instead of the `twenty-five large' that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars.  And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she'll agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room.  In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes;  while he is gone, her job is to watch for the `tell' of one of the other players.   	By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked.  The dialogue, and Mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing.  As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her.  From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a `tell' is and how it works, to the lessons of the `short con,' to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless.  And nothing is what it seems.  In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself.  She changes; and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation.   	Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does.  Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated.  She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well.  The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey), Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer), J.T. Walsh (The Businessman), Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran).  `House of Games' is the quintessential Mamet; he's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future.  But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up.  You'll find it under `Perfection.'  This is one great movie you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.

Watch this movie, a director is responsible for the performances he commits to film. Watch THE ARRIVAL or SLAP SHOT Lindsey Crouse is no Meryl Streep but she is light years better in those films than here. As an earlier great reviewer pointed out she sounds like a robot. Her delivery is so bad that Mantegna, playing Mike, looks pained in many of his scenes with her. This might have been a much better film with a capable director in charge. I have to compare it with Tea Leoni in DEEP IMPACT and even that is very unfair to Tea. Crouse has absolutely no inflection even before she is about to shoot Mike. She sounds Vulcan. Since she is on the screen in almost every scene, it A bombs the movie. She completely wrecks the film. Who, at Criterion Collection, decided that this should be 40 bucks on DVD? This is a classic? I grew up in the 80s and trust me nobody saw this film back then.Like all Mamet works, this is a hit piece. The target is psychology. Look, I do not know maybe David had a therapist who overcharged him. Dave did not have too many logic classes; how do I know? In your first logic class, you learn all the logical fallacies so you can refrain from even joining combat when an opponent makes the error of using one. The whole movie is the logical fallacy of AD HOMINEM. This means to the person. If you cannot defeat someone's argument call them names or make fun of them. Let's grant all his assertions about Margaret; she is a closet sociopath, she enjoys stealing and hurting people, let's broaden it for him. Let's imagine that a majority of therapists are all corrupt just like Margaret Ford, have I proved that therapy does not work in any way? Do the mental or moral states of therapists have anything to do with the efficacy of therapy? Yet, my friends, this is Mamet's thesis. Margaret is prototypical of hypocritical therapists who are sicker than their patients. Again, this is a giant non sequitur. The efficacy of therapy is not determined by the moral character of the fallible corrupt people who administer it any more than medical doctors treatments are undermined by their moral failings. Again, NON SEQUITUR, Dave take some logic please. Beyond these esoterics, look the film is slow, boring goes nowhere and you will endure, with the exception of Mantegna and Walsh, some of the worst acting you have ever witnessed. It will bore you to tears. We get she is goofy; OK, could we move on. No, we cannot because that is the entire point of this piece of crap. She is goofy, hence her therapy is hypocritical, ergo all psychology is a sham. Please, Dave you are embarrassing yourself. "},{"Title":"Tries to be stylish, ends up stilted.

That's about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets. It has to be the director Mamet Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and pretty steady TV and film career, so she can't perform this badly all the time. She's supposed to go from uptight, cool, controlled professional to calculating, wicked fast lady having fun, as shown by the change from beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear) to floppy floral sundress. But everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped, precise way; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed. The effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. At times 'House of Games' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot. The clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help either. The ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic, two-dimensional performances.

If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it.House of Games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna).  To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming.  Just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.The story is taut and well-crafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic).  Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive.  But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot (at one point, I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I'll say no more).House of Games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity.  It will hold your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time afterwards.

It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller.  It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong, strong cast of supporting players, and it introduces Ricky Jay, card sharp extraordinaire, prestidigitator and historian of magic.  Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unrealness.On the face of it, House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played merely for glamour and yuks.  At this level it does succeed admirably.However, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization.  The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin.  That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus, hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs.  House of Games sticks to its business.  As Poe once said of a good short story, it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.There is another strain of movies-about-women, epitomized by Thelma and Louise, a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed, whether or not they realize their inner strengths.  What tripe.As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater.  It should be a natural for film festivals.  Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter.  Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.

A movie that seems a straight forward thriller, but actually deals more with the desire to explore one's darker side. Mamet maybe made some of the plot twists seem a tad to obvious and doesn't quite manage to shake of a 'tv' approach, but that doesn't matter because Joe Mantegna gives a superb performance that lifts the other cast members above tv standard.One of David Mamet's better movie efforts (like Untouchables, Spanish Prisoner and Glengarry Glen Ross), it's best knowing nothing about this movie before seeing it.8/10.

Granted the stylized approach is a little off-putting at first, but on repeated viewings, it becomes appropriate in the context of the film.  Lindsay Crouse,(Mamet's wife at the time), plays a psychiatrist who methodically approaches her treatment of her patients, is a very closed person, and seemingly unfulfilled; hence, her interest and eventual immersion into the activities happening in the House of Games.  Her almost robotic reading of the lines seems to fit her screen personality.  She is at first curious and then becomes obsessed with Joe Mantegna and his way of life.  As we will see, she plays right into his hands, and so do we. I won't go into detail about the story and it's strengths since it has been said better in previous reviews on this board.  But the big con is on us, the viewers......we think we know what is happening...in fact we think we know several times.  WRONG!!

Dr. Ford's insights into human behaviour and motivations give her a giddy thrill in watching a mark succumb, and by giving us a peek behind the scenes, writer/director David Mamet allows us to get drawn in right along with her. In fact, our knowledge soon overtakes Dr. Ford's, when it becomes apparent that she herself has unknowingly become the patsy in a much bigger con-within-a-con. Nothing wrong with that, except that Mamet clearly expects us to be surprised by this revelation, long after it's blatantly obvious to everyone except the doc. At this point, she suddenly looks extremely gullible and slow-witted, our empathy with her is lost, and no amount of enjoyably hard-boiled Mamet dialogue can redeem the rest of the movie. (Incidentally, the strangely robotic performance from the usually compelling Lindsay Crouse, the former Mrs. Mamet, should be compared to the even-stiffer Rebecca Pigeon, the PRESENT Mrs. Mamet, in 1997's not-dissimilar Spanish Prisoner. Maybe Mamet just can't direct women who are his wives?)

There's no disputing his talent as a writer, but he does little to adapt the rhythm of his stage dialogue to the screen, and his story of confidence tricksters is a con in itself, leading viewers to expect perhaps more than they'll get. Once the plot begins to take shape it reveals some fascinating details about the ways in which professional swindlers take advantage of human nature, as a noted psychiatrist (Lindsay Crouse) learns after being seduced by the games people play (on themselves and each other). The script sets up a clever dilemma without ever providing a clear solution but this isn't, after all, meant to be a caper. The film is more a character study, but with a hole in the middle the characters all seem to exist in an isolated vacuum, almost as if, despite the natural settings, they were (surprise) performing on stage.

In his essay on compensation, which we would nowadays call immanent justice, (or maybe karma) Emerson wrote Commit a crime and the earth is made of glass. After participating in a theft and murder, Lindsay Crouse returns to her office and the first thing she does is close all the blinds, as if her conscience, indeed the conscience of the whole world, is outside, staring in at her. This is a fairly intelligent movie, especially considering that it's the first outing as director for David Mamet. He handles the camera quite well. Nothing looks stagy. And he knows when to let the shot linger on the door to The House of Games as it swings very slowly closed after Crouse enters for the first time, and we get to hear the latch click shut behind her. The screen is filled with a huge sturdy doorknob and lock, and a somewhat ragged sign reading simply Games.It's a story of the long con, meaning a thoroughly planned and time-consuming scenario played for big stakes, like The Sting. The whole plot, involving a dozen people, is orchestrated down to the smallest move and the placement of props by Joe Montegna and the mark is Crouse, although she doesn't discover this until the end, and then only by accident. Yes, some of the dialog sounds as if it's being read from cue cards, but I take this to be deliberate stylization. Crouse and Montegna have shown in other works that they can be as naturalistic as the next performer. Here, with Mamet's odd script, they take chances. There is a lot of repetition. Character A says, I'm going to take you somewhere. B says You're going to take me somewhere. This goes on mostly between the two leads. There are many instances, still sounding stylized, of speakers interrupting themselves and beginning a new utterance I can't believe that -- How did all this get started? I think rhetoricians call this anacoluthia but I wouldn't bet on it. When the narrative requires it, the dialog moves along with considerable verve. The script is to movies what Hemingway's prose was to literature as far as stylization goes, and it works here. (It doesn't always work vide Barfly.) The film gives us a picture of human nature that isn't very pretty. We are all con men, it says. And we are, in a way, although not always illegally. The sociologist Erving Goffman called our everyday con jobs impression management. Goffman also wrote a fascinating article called Cooling Out the Mark, a study of how con men quiet the mark down in order to leave him sufficiently satisfied with himself that he doesn't go to the cops or otherwise seek revenge. Montegna does a splendid job of cooling out Crouse You're going to feel a strong need to confess. Don't do it. You had nothing to do with it. It was all an accident. You're completely innocent. (This just after he's relieved her of eighty large and is about to beat it to the airport to skip town.) Lindsay Crouse, as I say, is the mark, but she's hardly an innocent bystander. She has written a best seller, Driven, about compulsive behavior, but she smokes a lot and steals things and is drawn to the world the con people inhabit. As a psychiatrist, however, she has learned to forgive herself (how do you do that?) and after shooting her exploiter full of numerous holes, she takes a vacation, comes back, and with tan and a big smile boosts a gold lighter out of the purse of a woman sitting next to her in a restaurant.

From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.There were a few movies I've seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it's way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something's going to happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the something is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface....House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion.In closing, I'd rank this 10 of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list), most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists I've ever seen as well.

While the film has elements of early film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre.Given that the presentation had no appeal to me, I was at least expecting an engaging story.

That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character. (However, his later films do improve.)

It's not for kids with ADD, much like the guy who claimed dreadful acting. It's a relatively slow-paced, compact, but short and sweet con movie. Mamet's writing is delivered by a cast that understands very well what they're in for - a con movie.Much like the protagonist, the viewer should focus on small psychological details - the way the characters speak, move, act, blink. All the clues are there, and yes, although it's somewhat predictable, as with any Mamet's film, the beauty comes from the writing. It's the little nuances with which he directs his cast that make the writing shine.Don't listen to wannabe-critics, they're clueless. This is a well-written and well-acted film.

House of Games contains all the staginess, clipped dialogue exchanges and aware acting styles that drives his critics up the wall. But for those who can easily slide onto a Mamet web and let him consume them? It's a beaut of a film.You wanna see how a true bad man plies his trade?Misdirection is the order of the day, both in thematics of the plot and in Mamet's telling of the tale. Firstly both Anchia and himself build a city of suspicion through shadows, dank streets and dimly lighted gambling parlours, then to this backdrop comes suspense by way of deceit, complex psychology and a searching examination of human nature and the basis of trust. With us viewers being the fly on the wall to the workings of the con-artist, it makes for compelling viewing anyway, that it's also a crafty thriller with tricks up its sleeve marks it out still further as a film of substance. Even the final act throws up a final question that forces the audience to re-evaluate what conclusion they may have already drawn.Assured performances from the cast seal the deal to make this a must see for Mamet fans.

When the film-maker/screenwriter in his case waves the hand over the audience and reveals the big con, the reaction is almost always surprise, because usually the narrative has been constructed competently and subtly enough that it is not entirely predictable. But there is a secondary effect, where the plot details that have culminated into this big reveal are rendered hazy or allowed to become somewhat illogical because well, it was all a ruse. HoG doesn't fall entirely into this trap like say, The Usual Suspects, but remains uninspiring.Margaret Ford is a successful and best-selling psychiatrist, and seems to truly care about her patients despite the spotlight. In the opening, a stranger recognises her face beneath her sunglasses, a little clue that suggests that she is not nearly as covert as she thinks she is. When she confronts a loan-shark in a shady bar, there is nothing but good intentions, and she reads him from the start. The trouble is, he reads her better. Mike (Joe Mantegna) is best performer of the film in a literal sense; he is smooth talking, but could appear so even without explaining the gears and cogs of the con world. They face each other only after a few glances, and he so overpoweringly seduces her into his world. Later, as he demonstrates a con but cannot scam a genuine well-meaning man, the illusion is complete - and we too, believe this. Mamet's story would completely fall apart if it weren't for these initial deduction from Margaret as she spot the water gun scam - the audience needs to believe that she is a good judge of character, and also that they themselves trust Margaret's judgement. The closeup and reaction shots of the ring and the fake gun seem objective in their deceit and in unveiling her keen eye. In the hotel room, as she glances over at Mike, he replies back with the confidence and control that has been instilled into her, and we are so assured. Later, we are placed in her unknowing shoes, full of fear and paranoia, and the lighting characterises this, plunging her figure in complete darkness as she overhears snippets of a police sting. There is a jump scare, which is the only one and carefully placed, which signals her growing anxiety, which is brilliantly combined with a harmless point of the finger and the ever ringing school bell. It is unfortunate that Crouse cannot match a plot and supporting actor of such promising calibre. Her performance is stilted, and cannot produce the necessary subtext, so we are treated to mounds of exposition from the elderly companion who acts as some sort of psychiatrist for Margaret herself. Her delivery is mostly mechanical, only seldom smiles or laughs or shows any signs of affection as she is seduced, and in the climax, she cannot conjure enough rage although she has been clearly wronged. Maybe Mamet, her at the time husband, might have found Crouse attractive and hypnotic and appropriate to step into the femme fatale role, but there is barely a hint of this person in the film. And so his dialogue, which is sometimes twice as long as necessary as per theatre, which is brash and direct, seems to often bounce off a mannequin that is halfway glance at the script instructions (in parentheses such as these - prompting her to deliver her dialogue with resignation, with wonder, with irritation) but cannot fulfill them anyway. At times Mamet shows his lack of directing experience and signals that he originates from the stage; characters will stand up or aside to have a whispered private conversation, yet the other parties are conspicuous and clearly in the frame. Such a thing would flow with ease in a play, but here it becomes stilted, and the atmosphere and tension that Mamet has no doubt thought of while writing the script evaporates.

I have no idea if the director can be faulted for the abysmal acting. I am sure that when working with this level of talent there are budget considerations (the contracts are signed and there are only so many times you can ask for yet another take before fiscal limitations stop the process). My impression is that the casting director is number one in the blame line here. Joe Mantegna was a chiseled, handsome guy long before he learned a thing or two about acting and if we are to believe him cast as a grifter, it seems like someone with a similar level of sex appeal would have been a better choice for the female lead.

One of her patients comes to his appointment and claims an underground speak-easy of gamblers are out to get him because he owes a large gambling debt. Her patient tells her she must speak with Mike, and Ford decides to take investigate.She wanders into a shady bar with a gambling room at the back. There she finds Mike (Joe Mantegna), an amiable and well-dressed man who happens to engage in gambling. Turns out her patient's gambling debt is not as high as he had said. Mike makes the psychiatrist a deal if she'll help him out in a current poker game, he'll forgive the debt. She agrees, and thus becomes enraptured with this cutting edge world of gamblers and grifters. She learns Mike is a grifter, a con artist who uses deception and cunning against marks who willingly give him money.Dr. Ford, bored with her position as a psychiatrist at a local medical institution, decides she'll devote more of her time to writing. Her subject gamblers and grifters who live on the periphery of mainstream society. She insists Mike teach her everything about con games. Not just gambling games, but the games he plays to extract cash out of unsuspecting victims, many of whom don't realize they are being conned.David Mamet's foray into the world of grifters is one of the better offerings of its type. Similar fair include The Sting, The Film-Flam Man and The Grifters. Mantegna in particular makes the perfect con artist, whose charm and likability pull in marks from all social strata. In an interesting scene, Mantegna demonstrates why the con of con man means confidence in which the grifter gives his confidence to the mark. He compels a young soldier-in-training (William Macy) into giving a sizable amount of cash to a complete stranger at a Western Union office. A well-done and thoroughly entertaining film.

From Harry In Your Pocket to The Sting, and everything in between, there's satisfaction and pleasure in watching the story unfold and come together like puzzle pieces. So I'm willing to overlook a lot to enjoy a good con.House of Games isn't a bad movie. In fact, in the right hands, it could have been brilliant. But poor casting choices and what seems to be an iron-fisted direction style have doomed this film to mediocrity.Director and writer David Mamet seems to have been intent on controlling every moment with an almost obsessive focus. The actors seem to struggle to break free and act. Yet they seem reined in as if every move, every word and action were carefully (and poorly) choreographed.The script, like the direction, is wooden and inflexible, rendering a dichotomy throughout as if it was written for the stage, not for a camera. It's technically correct, but artistically binding. As a result, the actors struggle to sound realistic and natural, and it comes across as forced. In the lead role, Lindsay Crouse is stiff and amateurish. Her character never really develops from the cool and uptight physician to the loose and morally reckless criminal that she is supposed to become. Her lines are delivered like a recitation, as if she is struggling to get each syllable correct. I'm not sure if it's her acting or Mamet's directing. Either way, it can be painful to watch at times.The rest of the cast strive to overcome Mamet's direction, and for the most part, they succeed. Joe Mantegna turns on the charm here and there, and pulls off the affable con man with as much panache as he's allowed. The story is great, and had the cast been allowed to run with it, the movie might have been a real gem. The subtle nuances that could have given the film depth were all but ignored, sub-plots went nowhere, and characters that should have been more developed came across two-dimensional.As I said, I'm willing to forgive a lot for art's sake, and this movie required a lot of forgiveness. But it did provide a couple of hours of entertainment. It kept me engrossed and involved, and for that I gave it a 6 out of 10 stars.

However, nothing ever delivered the surprise of seeing House of Games for the first time. I have to admit, this film got me in completely and I didn't see the tricks coming until they happened &#x96; I got my money's worth.Briefly, without giving too much away, the story is about Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), a psychologist and best-selling author who becomes involved with Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic gambler and con artist. Although she seems a fairly grounded person she becomes intrigued with his lifestyle. Before the surprise ending, as Mike says, she learned things about herself that she would rather not know. As Margaret takes a walk on the wild side, the landscape changes from the clean architecture of her very ordered, sophisticated and academic environment to the rain-slicked, neon-lit mean streets of Mike's world.The unusual rhythms of the dialogue, which often sound overly formal or precise, add to the off-centre feeling of the film. Now I realise that those speech patterns are a key part of Mamet's art and are even more pronounced in a film such as The Spanish Prisoner, but the first time you encounter it, you are struck by it's strangeness. If the dialogue reminds me of any non-Mamet film it is Clifford Odet's script for Sweet Smell of Success. On that film, when the director was worried that Odet's dialogue would sound stagy or exaggerated, Odets told him, 'Play it real fast. Play it on the run and it will work just fine'. I think the effectiveness of Mamet's dialogue is all in the playing as well. The theme of 'don't believe everything you see' popped up in other Mamet films following House of Games including the unsettling Homicide and the offbeat The Spanish Prisoner. However, by the time he got around to Heist, I think he had gone to the well once too often; the surprises there seemed a little too trite.But, House of Games is unique. It's as clever as The Sting, but with a harder edge. It's a film you can watch again and again and always find another aspect to enjoy.

There are holes in the story, sure, and I'll get to those later. But for those of you wondering how you transfer a work of literature from the stage to the film set, this makes for a wonderful study. You may have noticed how some techniques do not transfer from the stage to film set easily, if at all, but that's partly what makes this film so fascinating. It's a play on roles and their traps and freedoms.Margaret Ford is an intriguing character; educated to the point of embodying a robotic decorum, her faintly masculine persona as an educator is absorbing to watch. Her success as a psychologist and an author should bring her a sense of inner peace and satisfaction, but there is something missing from the equation.The fact is that Margaret is intelligent enough to know that she is not really helping people, only playing a role of elevated status in the social order. A role she has worked hard and studied hard to win. But now that she is secured in her success she has doubts about its true validity. She possesses advanced knowledge of a type, but have her educational activities drawn out the best in her or simply made her another cookie cutter personality? Margaret wants to help and it is this desire to truly help that gets her involved in some really rugged business.Enter Mike into the frame. Mike is also an intriguing character; soft-spoken and suave, glib almost to the point of being feminine, he also comes across as a personality conforming to a type of role, that of the shifty con man. He is playing the tough guy, but he's far too articulate to carry that off convincingly.So what's really going on here? What you have in 'House of Games' to my way of thinking, are males playing at being men and a lone female playing at being a female according to definitions that in the end prove as unworkable and unsatisfying as some of Margaret's psychology sessions with her patients. That these roles do the exact opposite of what they are intended to do, i.e., ultimately feminize the male in spite of all his macho posturing and masculinize the female despite her avowed assertion to want to help through expressions of her own compassion is what makes this so thought provoking a piece.Margaret realizes near the end of act one in this film that her intelligence and shrewd observational skills have just barely saved her from being conned out of a substantial portion of her money. At this point, she has demonstrated both Moral and Intellectual authority over these would be predatory Con Men. This is surely enough to warrant a chapter in her next upcoming book.But what does she do? She returns to have another dance with the Devil in the pale moonlight.Why? This is the interesting part and where the hole in the plot leaks like a squirt gun filled with water. Why does she do it? Why does Margaret return to consort with Con Men who have already tried to make her a mark and who undoubtedly will try again should she have any further dealings with them? What is it about her academic environment that is so arid and vacuous that she must at length seek out a criminal for a date? That this is in the end a date movie with a deadly twist is not be denied. It appears to me there should have been a male character or characters in Margaret's academic setting with whom she tries to relate but fails to do so. This would have lent greater credence to her rendezvous with Mike.Yes, Margaret comes back and bares her breast to all the misogynistic intentions and elaborated schemes of this den of thieves she has stumbled upon in her quest to truly help a human being in need.Why does she do it? To feel more like a woman? At the end, she attempts to exact her revenge on Mike using his methods which, it turns out he understands better than she does as he has been applying them most of his adult life.All I can say is I would have rather seen her wearing a wire and regaining both the Moral and Intellectual high ground she demonstrated at the beginning of the film to bookend it here.I think this would have been more interesting than seeing her become both a murderer and a thief. She could have watched Mike being taken away in handcuffs while she fought hard to stifle her tears at the loss of this love of her life. Somewhat like the last scene in 'The Maltese Falcon', only this time with the woman contemplating the stuff that dreams are made of...

I don't always agree with Roger Ebert (RIP) , but I'm 100% with him when it comes to this movie. This is a brilliant movie that yet needs to be discovered by the world , despite it's not completely anonymous to mainstream audience. Most of the complains that some reviewers had with this movie I find to be completely unintelligible . Lack of stars ? That's a big plus for the movie . Mamet didn't want stars in his movie ( he could afford them after the success of Brian de Palma's The Untouchables &#x96; he was the writer of that movie) for similar reason that Kubrick didn't wanted to cast them in 2001  Space odyssey &#x96; he was afraid they would distract the viewer from the story itself. It's easier to believe in what is happening on the screen , if you aren't watching a famous movie star . Predictability ? There's hardly any in here and show me a thriller that isn't one bit predictable. Theatricality ? Many great movies are theatrical &#x96; Twelve angry men , Dial M for murder , The Hill , Sleuth &#x85;House of games isn't really about fun. It isn't about who is gonna trick who and how. Mamet doesn't stop when the con is over , but goes one step more &#x96; he asks how the con changes you. Or maybe it didn't really changed you and only allowed to see truth about yourself ? House of games is much more deeper and darker than typical lighthearted fun movie about con artists . The famous The Sting looks shallow by the comparison (more entertaining ? Definitely , but still rather shallow).This is a debut for Mamet as a director . House of games is pretty much directed as a stage play . Mamet's directing style is intentionally flat and cold . There is a hypnotic quality in it. Mamet drags you into world where any kind of human emotion is barely seen. The dialogue here is stilted &#x96; a sign of modern theatre. It also gives the movie an surreal feel.The screenplay is brilliant. It's all based on psychology. A subtle gesture or choice of words is incredibly important. Not the twists are important , but the characters. The player and the mark. It's a character driven story. Watch out for small signs like clothes , because they will tell you what is going on inside somebody's head. David Mamet really seems to know human nature. This movie made me realize just how much similar movie maker is to a con artist and especially how in our everyday life were playing games with each other and even with ourselves.Lindsay Crouse doesn't help the movie with her dour performance , but I can't say she destroys it either. She isn't exactly a bad actress . Crouse gave a good performance in Places in heart (for which she was nominated for Oscar). Maybe she was misguided by Mamet (her husband at that time) who told her to don't show too many emotions. Anyway her deadpan emotions for most of the time fits the movie and I could name few actresses who would be even worse than Crouse in this particular role (Jennifer Aniston for example).On other hand Joe Mantegna (mostly known for Godfather 3) not quite steals the show , but definitely shines every time he's on the screen . He's confident , manly , dominating and has an aura of mystery around him. Along with Homicide (another Mamet movie) this is his best performance . The other actors and actresses don't really have much to play , but they fit their characters and are OK.The ending is disturbing and thought provoking . It will make you ask questions about good and evil , human nature and psychology . You will find something new with another re-watch of the movie. I give it 9/10.

Though the story, once it gets rolling, is pretty predictable, and the twists - save maybe the last one - can be seen from miles away, the script is good enough and the dialog witty enough, David Mamet's skill at its finest.But Mamet's directorial work kills it. I've heard it said that he deliberately makes the delivery in his films wooden and flat. Well, I'm calling the bluff here (har har, see what I did there?) even if it's intentional, that doesn't mean it's good. Mamet's direction creates a total disconnection between the viewer and the characters, and doesn't allow us to care about what happens to any of them; that makes some sense in the context of this particular story, but it also makes the entire film flat and dry. Lindsay Crouse's horrible performance is often referred to, but it's hardly her fault - veteran character actor Joe Mantegna is just as bad. In fact, the single best acting in the entire film comes in the form of a five-minute supporting performance by an anonymous W.(William) H. Macy, who was clever enough to make Mamet's style work for his character.Mamet fans defend House of Games at all costs mainly because it's Mamet's directorial debut, but the fact remains that when another director works with Mamet's script you may get a film as powerful, moving and unforgettable as Glengarry Glen Ross, and with Mamet at the helm you get this mess. There's no accounting for House of Games' fervent fan base, but many superior con artist themed movies were released before and after to less critical acclaim - Catch Me If You Can, The Anderson Tapes, Matchstick Men and even Mamet's own Heist.

Mamet argues there is shadow in Ford so hence the field is really worthless. He has her mentor babbling quixotic stupidities like you must forgive yourself right after she thinks she shot someone. This is no accident. The temporal placement makes psychology look like it is full of ivory towered cloistered fools who do not get out much. It is such a hit piece on psychotherapy disguised as a drama on con men. This is not TIN MEN not by a long shot and believe me Mamet is no Barry Levinson.

So i decided to watch with relatively high expectations. But not only did the film not meet my expectations, I ended up completely loathing it. I still can't begin to understand how this film can have so much critical acclaim. Except the cinematography, not a single thing works.It is clear that Mamet is a playwright as the dialogues sound completely lifted from his plays. The lines are so unrealistic and so not engaging, that I found myself laughing at them. The plot is extremely weak. The first con may fool you, but everything that follows is predictable with a capital P. A con movie's strength lies in its ability to keep the viewer guessing and then fooling the viewer. Not only did I not get fooled, but even someone who is not paying attention will be able to predict the big con that takes place at the end. The storyline is essential in a con-movie,and this film showed me why due its weakness.Let's now come to the acting which I believe is the weakest thing in the film. Joe Mantegna is the only one in the whole film who is believable and whose charisma works to some extent. Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford delivers one of the most atrocious, mechanical, lifeless performances I have ever seen. You don't have to like or dislike the protagonist, but you have to connect with him/her. To say that I didn't connect with her character will be an enormous understatement. In this film her line delivery actually makes Kristen Stewart's performances in the Twilight films look Oscar- worthy. I have seen some comments on this site defending Crouse's performance by saying that her wall- like performance is justified because she is playing the role of a person who is reserved, introverted and has always lived within restrictions. I completely disagree with that argument. Just because you are reserved, doesn't mean you have to be completely lifeless and be a human wall. The prime example to defend my case will be the character of Gerd Wiesler played by Ulrich Mühe in The Lives of Others. Wiesler was also a serious, reserved character who had been made so by incidents in his past. But I loved Ulrich Mühe's performance as he still remained believable and intense. He spoke and behaved like a normal shy,introverted person. You don't have to speak like a robot with no expressions and have the acting range of a wall to convey the fact that the character is uptight. Even William H Macy's guest appearance disappointed me and I like Macy's acting in everything else. Mind you, the silly nature of the lines that the actors have to say don't make their jobs any easier to conjure even the slightest bit of realism. This over the top dialogues and wooden acting might be Mamet's style and it might work in his plays, but for me it doesn't work at all in a film.The cinematography works to some extent. I liked the use of the light and the shadows which created a noir-like effect. So apart from the cinematography and Mantegna's performance, nothing in this film works. I will never be able to comprehend how Roger Ebert thought this film was good enough to find a place in his list of Great Movies.

The Mamet pattern is pretty simple and is explained extensively in The House of Games set up a story in some edgy setting and then build up the audience trust in the proceedings, only to add a manipulative twisty ending.There is one big flaw with that kind of 'ain't I clever' artsy flicks, and it is exactly the same as with whodunits. Either the twist is too abrupt and it really feels like an 'in your face' conclusion, or it is too soft and you are bored because you saw it coming. Either way it's a loser. I reckon some like deceptive story lines, and yes it works once in a while The Usual Suspects worked... on first viewing, but there is no way to enjoy it again afterwards.What I liked in The House of Games is the soft directing style, it's a bit too much on the artsy stagey side but it is really enjoyable to have a director know how to set up an atmosphere. Then I think most of the movie exists thanks to Joe Mantegna. He is very good and it helps because the lead is a pretty lousy character. And the actress is totally unimpressive there is expressing a lot with little, and there is little little.I guess the bland introverted hero is a way to summon cheap mystery, but it is not really a way to captivate one's audience. With such a low level of involvement, no wonder you see the twist coming and then you just don't care any more about the main character, then the ending simply doesn't matter.

This is initially quite intriguing and soon draws the audience into a twisting plot which rapidly becomes totally engrossing. The events that are depicted take place in a world of con artists and fraudsters where so much of what takes place is not as it seems and trust is at a premium.Dr Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) is a successful psychiatrist and best selling author who harbours serious doubts about her ability to help her patients and also feels that her life is empty and unfulfilled. She confides in her mentor, Dr Maria Littauer (Lilia Skala) that she has no real pleasures in life and is advised to enjoy her success and to give herself all the rewards that she'd like to have.Margaret specialises in the treatment of obsessive/compulsive behaviour and has a patient called Billy Hahn (Steve Goldstein), a gambler who's in desperate trouble because of a $25,000 debt that he owes to a man who's threatened to kill him if he doesn't pay up by the next day. In an attempt to resolve her patient's problem, Margaret visits a seedy bar called the House Of Games where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna). Mike tells her that Billy's debt is actually only $800 and that he would willingly write off the debt if she would simply agree to accompany him to a poker game to observe the body language of one of the other players. She does this and what transpires gives her an insight into a subculture which instantly fascinates her.Margaret becomes preoccupied by her experience at the House Of Games and suggests to Mike that she would like him to show her more about the con game so that she could possibly write a book on the subject. Mike agrees and what follows takes Margaret on an incredible journey of self discovery as her powerful attractions to Mike and his life of deception lead her and the story in a number of unexpected directions before the movie reaches its shocking climax.Early on in the film, Margaret is an uptight workaholic who's very formal and aloof but through her experiences with Mike, learns a great deal about herself and eventually transforms into someone who dresses less formally, shows greater warmth and begins to forgive herself for her wrongdoings.Lindsay Crouse gives a very deadpan performance as a cold professional woman whose life is joyless and Joe Mantegna is perfect as the charismatic con man who's an expert in the art of deception.House Of Games shows how some scams are carried out and also provides an insight into the psychology involved. This is very interesting to the majority of people and provides a good example of how a restricted budget need not damage a movie's chances of success as long as the subject matter is sufficiently compelling.

I hated the language, I hated the characters, I hated the tone, but then something changed. Mamet finally took control of this film and pulled the audience in by tricking all of us into thinking this was a film about a young love and the darkness of the world, when instead it was all about something deeper. If you go into this film expecting the classic 1980s cliché of woman meets man, man is a criminal, woman changes man thus leading to a sloppy wet ending, you will be utterly disappointed. This structure is initially how I envisioned this film, and with the first half an hour filmed the way it was, there was no doubt in my mind that I had been suckered into just another average crime film. Then, midway through the picture, the tones and themes dramatically change. I didn't even see it coming, but when you least expect it, like the con performed in this film, it will blindside you quicker than a deer on the highway. House of Games leaves you with this perfect example of just how dark David Mamet is.This is a film that most will either hate or love. The reason that I say this is because the language of the film is extremely stagey. Before this film, David Mamet had found his success with his plays. The power of his characters, the unjustness of his plots, and the vile of his villains were key elements to packing his plays full of patrons. In House of Games he attempts to bring the stage to the screen without any changes. You can literally hear the beats between the characters when they are talking. The language that they use feel and sound as if they are acting in front of a live audience, not just for the camera. This makes the words a bit stale at times. You can visually see this film as a play because of the language that is used. Again, some will hate this about the film, while others will see it as nothing short of classic Mamet. For me, I hated it at first, but as the film developed, I began to see the logic behind it. The quickness of the conversations between the characters gave more definition to the con that they were trying to perform. I always felt as if they were quickly getting something by me. About the middle of the film, I began listening to every word said afraid that I would miss a key element that would unravel this tight plot. I began waiting for scenes where Margaret (Crouse) would stumble on her words, change the meaning, thus allowing us to develop the evil that was within her. Slowly and steadily this stagey language worked for me, and it gave just a small addition to the characters.For anyone that has ever seen most of Mamet's film versions (and some of his stage performances) you will notice that he is notorious for using the same characters throughout. I like this quite a bit. Christopher Guest uses the same technique. While I have talked to some that think that it only shows the repetition of his originality, I think that it gives Mamet definition and substance. I loved watching this early film of Mamet's and see a young William H. Macy in a scene and his use of my favorite J.T. Walsh. It is fun to watch these actors grow in Mamet's films. Many of them you can see in State & Main and Heist. Does that mean that they are necessarily good actors then? I don't think so. While I liked the continual use of the same characters, some (more than others), have trouble with the characters. For example, in House of Games, it was obvious that Lindsay Crouse did not have control over her character. She seemed fake in her scenes, and did not counter will with Mantegna (who gave a great performance). She seemed on a different beat compared to the others in this film, and I think it hurt House of Games somewhat. She wasn't the strongest actress that Mamet could have chosen.While I loved the con throughout the film, I did feel as if the ending was a bit on the weak side. Without giving it away, it started to feel used before it was over. I knew deep within me where it was going, but I kept waiting for the big hurrah, but alas, there wasn't any. That is where Mamet missed his mark. The ending needed to be stronger. I loved watching this simple woman transform into evil and the entire themes that went along with that, but I needed more. I loved the anti-romantic notion of this film, but I needed more. I loved the character interactions in this film, but I needed more. That was exactly how I felt about this film. I loved House of Games, but I needed more. Mamet ended the film without giving us closure, and while the rest of the film was exciting to watch, this ending just left me soured.Overall, I loved it, but I don't think that I could watch it again. Mamet is one of the greatest writers of our generation providing us with some very cult anti-Hollywood cinema, but this first film was a rough-cut. It was smart, intelligent, and overall a stage version of his play onto film. A stronger transition was needed from stage to screen. The characters were somewhat developed and the plot was sensational. The darkness by the end of the film caught me unprepared. I liked this film, but a second viewing is not in my future. I love David Mamet's work and cannot wait to submerge myself into more of his films later.Grade *** out of ***** "},{"Title":"To slow, to predictable, but still likable.","Date":"21 July 2003","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I wouldnt agree that this movie is a masterpiece.

I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  This was one of the smartest, most well-written movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development.  On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations.  The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable.  It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film.  I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset.  Their work, plus Mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's.  It is truly a must-see.

This film is extremely well written, and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit, con-artistry and back room hustles.

I'm too lazy to describe the whole scene but in short Mikes friend seems to put 20$ in this envelope and gives it to Margaret who actually believes she has now 20$ in the envelope even though she has just been told she will be shown a cheating trick.In a situation like this anyone who hasn't grown up in a barrel or something would suspect that the envelope is really empty. However this woman who is supposed to be intelligent enough (she's a famous psychologist after all) doesn't have a clue.However this didn't annoy me that much. It felt a bit stupid but I kept on watching. The midsection of the movie was pretty OK.Then near the end came the airport scene which left me feeling pretty awkward and sort of spoiled the movie for me Mike (who we at this point know is supposed to be this pretty elaborate professional con artist who you'd think could probably plot his way out of a bad situation) basically simply tells Margaret to bite it when she's pointing a gun at him. Then when she gets mad and shoots him in the leg he gets mad too and really starts insulting her. It's like he's suddenly gotten a death wish or something. So Margared shoots him again; he politely asks for some more. Margaret shoots him dead and the movie basically ends there. After this comes a scene in which we are shown that she got away with it but there's nothing much happening anymore Margaret is a restaurant with a friend. She autographs a book, steals a cigarette lighter and soon after that the end texts start rolling (as did my eyes).This movie has in my opinion to some extent the same sort of feel as To Live and Die in L.A., if you like it chances are you'll like this too. Some critics say To Live and Die in L.A. is one of greatest thrillers ever and the car chase scene in it is supposed to be really good but in my opinion the movie felt often a bit too 'artsy' and absurd (as also did the House of Games in some scenes) and the car chase scene actually made me eventually laugh in disbelief; it just seemed to last for ever and felt generally weird.You are of course free to make your own decisions but while watching the credits roll I myself felt like this movie had suddenly gone seriously TV-movie on me.

First, the plot. Without giving anything away, suffice it to say that a distracted young chimp could anticipate each of the so-called twists. Now, the acting. With the exception of Montegna, who is the only remotely believable character, the performances wouldn't pass muster at a community theater in the outskirts of Boise, Idaho. Several lines/scenes are downright comical. My only defense of the movie is that it may have been adapted from a play, because that's what it felt like - a group of mediocre stage actors, directed by a 20-year old drama major, collectively trying to muddle their way through their first film. The bottom line is that this flick certainly doesn't warrant the relatively high rating that the IMDb audience gives it. It misses the mark so badly, in fact, that it makes me question the credibility of the rating system itself. I want my 2 hours back, and if your I.Q. is over 100, chances are that you will too.

In short, it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing what's happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen. The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it's still difficult to guess where it's going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. As mentioned, I'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. The way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film. Another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.

Fitting, since it was his first, as well. The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. It's like The Grifters, but without that film's level of acting. (In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.The dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be. I was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.I wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines --  but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.It's standard con movie stuff the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she'd write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. We're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. We see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is. If you want Mamet, go watch Glengarry Glen Ross again -- James Foley did him better.*** "},{"Title":"I got ripped off in this con movie","Date":"25 December 2007","Score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" This movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting.

It's where the urban man discovered that he could be easily deceived by his dearest ones. Since that date, many urban men and women, in other movies, lived the same trick again and again. Yet, as times goes by, some of them learned the lesson, out of watching too many movies I think!, then developed an armor, and &#x96; why not &#x96; got to deceive the deceiver too. (House of Games) presents the phase where the played-with becomes a player, but does this movie play it right ?! This was originally intended to be a larger-budget movie with many name actors, but writer / director (David Mamet) chose to cast his wife (Lindsay Crouse) and friend (Joe Mantegna). Not necessarily a good decision! I didn't like the performance of (Crouse) as the heroine. Yes, the character is for an outwardly cold woman who suppresses her reactions, but that doesn't mean that the actress must be cold and suppress her reactions! I watched (Joe Mantegna) as an impostor before; a mild &#x96; if not idiot &#x96; one in some movies, and a bloody violent one in other. This time he didn't bring something else his known goods. Let alone that his charisma didn't help him being a lead, so he couldn't provide the masculine charm to convince us that he's that lover-in-predicament (especially after the murder's plot). Yet, still the worst of the movie is its climax.We have a con-is-born situation. Although that female psychiatrist, Margaret, looks initially innocent, but she has some impostor hidden inside of her, supposedly long time age. OK. But I believe that that character had to be beaten by the experience's intelligence of the first, and senior, impostor; Mike. Since the beginning we follow the interlock of the psychiatrist / the scientific experience, with the conman / the practical experience. If both of them are natural born impostors, one of them obviously has a primitive practical expertise, and I do mean Margaret. That's why I see that the gun, which she takes from Mike's partner and shots Mike himself with at the climax, isn't a real gun in the first place, or it is one that has false bullets (like the one which the fake cop, played by J.T. Walsh, was holding). Because Mike's death &#x96; in my viewpoint &#x96; had to be pure acting since that psychiatrist who declared finally her truth as a criminal, imposter, and killer doesn't hold a candle to those experienced conmen who practiced the profession longer than what she did.It's close to Double Indemnity's plot. At that 1940s movie there was a man who became a victim of a woman and her partner to kill someone so they may win something. Here, a woman became a victim of a man and his partner to kill someone &#x96; falsely &#x96; so they may win something. The difference this round is that the victim is smarter. She got to payback, kill the planners themselves and win everything. It's clear that (Mamet) wants to prove that the evil guy is inside of us, and if gets free will practice his games successfully on others, and if has science will be the cleverest player of them all. But I believe that the older criminal &#x96; even if lost the scientific systematization or the methodical mentality &#x96; is more capable of hoaxing that who's still a student in crime school. That master's experience must defeat the inexperienced (like the green sailor) or the new beginners (like the heroine herself) whether the degrees of evil inside of both, the master and the others, were equaled or not. Because &#x96; simply &#x96; no one wins but the lucky, and no one always wins but the clever player.It's as unpersuasive as going into a gang of pro pickpockets, while being no pickpocket, and pulling off stealing all of them ! Well, it's a Hollywood dream then. Therefore if &#x96; for instance &#x96; the last scene, of the restaurant, was kind of a late flashback; that flawed climax could have been more persuasive and realistic. Whatever the addition might be, the movie needed to root well that that psychiatrist was an old con indeed; she merely didn't have a big chance before, and the ones who played her didn't know that about her earlier. Overall, I liked how (Mamet) studied so many stings, scams and con jobs, tightened the matter of obsession from start to finish, and mastered making so sedate crime movie. However, I didn't think that the shocking climax is logical or solidly built. It's something to shock anyway, and hit the viewer with the movie's main moral about the devil in us. Hence, it serves finely as a revenge for all the inexperienced and &#x96; mostly &#x96; the previously hoaxed out there. To tell them that you can deceive too, and &#x96; of all people &#x96; the ones who deceived you before, and without having any previous experience too. So it feels eventually as a perfect Revenge of The Nerds, not Revenge of The ones who-just-look-outwardly Nerds !

One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin's...ten year later perhaps. Both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed, up-tight character says, What's life without adventure?

Like Margaret Ford for instance (played by Lindsay Crouse), she is supposed to be a highly regarded psychologist, and yet she is a heavy smoker. She would not be the kind of therapist that I would seek for advice on how to kick a habit. Or the one played by J.T.

Comment on commentsThe intentionally hyper-stagy dialog style Mamet sometimes uses is here used only between the two leads (Crouse and Mantegna); the rest is quite naturalistic for movie dialogue, especially the dealer at the poker game (admittedly a small part, but I've heard various types of poker patter before and this was good.) and between the con guys, even though that dialogue was frequently, in the movie, staged. I thought, as a lot of commenters on IMDb did, that this has near-great quality, but one thing really bothered me, plot-wise. The pre-con relies on a water pistol that looks very much like a real gun; I've never seen such a thing, but this is the USofA so it's quite plausible. The problem is that the water pistol had to be filled to move the story along; a plot point, right? And the shrink has to notice water dripping from it. It is also necessary for her to be hooked by the con as an exotic activity. She's impressed and fascinated. THIS is a problem, because, if these guys are so good, why would they put water in the fake gun? It gives Ricky Jay a good line, but doesn't make sense. The shrink is not THAT naive and not in THAT dire need of an exotic hook (though she is both) that she could believe these smart guys could be so stupid. I love this movie and it is near-great, but that one thing bothers the heck out of me. And stop with the Sting comparisons! It's like quasars and Allen wrenches (i'm tired of apples and oranges); one is a fine Hollywood entertainment about charming cons and this other is a study of the darker side of our own desires and obsessions.

Once you've seen The Sting, there's almost no other reason to see or make another one. I'm not going to say that the screenplay for House of Games was a bad one; it was fine. But I had the plot figured out in the first five minutes and wasn't fooled by a single plot twist anywhere except for why it ended the way it did. I even think the Dirty Rotten Scoundrel's comedy with Michael Caine and Steve Martin was more clever than this film. If I had to pick out my two biggest problems with the film I would have to choose David Mamet the writer and David Mamet the director. First of all, there was nothing--I mean nothing--I could find to like or relate to about Lindsay Crouse's character. Mamet has a habit of making all his characters seem distant and shallow which is fine if that's the point, but who wants to sit through two hours of all monotone, one-dimensional characters? I even like stories where there are no heroes and everyone's a bad guy, but not when Mamet writes it. It's almost as if I sense Mamet thinks of himself as the good guy because he's exposing you to these kind of people.The problem with Mamet's directing is that his actors don't even appear to listen to the other actors in the scene. Every actor looks so rehearsed it looks more like a bad play than a film that had a chance to take a few takes and get the dialog right. I don't know why every scene has to feel like a business meeting instead of regular people having a conversation. You would think in a film about con men, the audience has to BELIEVE in these characters. They have to trust them. And at no point, could I understand, with what little experiences the two main characters shared, why Crouse's character would trust Mantegna's. And Mantegna's such a great actor, I KNOW he can evoke sincerity. But not with Mamet directing. Maybe in this age of irony I was expecting too much, like for example, Crouse's character to have been conning Mantegna's the whole time. Or at least when she figured it out, to have gotten even with him on his own level. Instead, she shoots him!? How 1950's! Like I said, if the characters in this film were interesting (and they are just plain NOT) or if there were some NEW insights into the art of confidence men (and there's NOT) then I would recommend it.

There were too many factual errors and plot holes to count. (i.e. When the cop was standing in the bathroom with his gun hanging out of his belt loop and he's talking on the radio in plain view.) (It was right then I figured out they were probably scamming her. And the supposedly intelligent, millionaire psychiatrist doesn't discover this for another half hour or so.) Also, the cop is going to arrest them when they haven't done anything yet and then he dies instantly from a gunshot wound to the stomach. (I might also add that this doesn't tip off the psychiatrist that she's being scammed.) And in the last scene in the airport when she shoots Mike (Joe Mantegna), he's obviously shot in the back of his thigh, (you can see the bullet hole, the fabric flies up) but he grabs the back of his knee, a good 8 inches lower. How they let that one slip through I'll never know. Overall, it was a movie that COULD have been a great thriller with a star cast and a huge budget, instead it was a waste of time.

Even with that said, I still enjoyed the movie thouroughly because Mamet's writing of the dialogue is brilliant, quirky and deep. If you can get past the grittiness of the acting, I think you will like the movie.  You can tell that the subject of a con game was well researched and implemented seamlessly into the plot.

I have seen Lindsay Crouse in other movies and consider her to be a good actor.  I suspect that the direction she was given just didn't work for me.  The dialogue was delivered in a very stilted way as though the character was detached from herself.As for direction, well... it kept reminding me that it was a movie, instead of engaging me in the plot and characters.  There seemed to be a specific goal of being stylish.  There was an overuse of primary colors in scenes and then contrasted with browns and greys.

It also referred to the black-and-white medium for these pictures. But the color in his films in no way diminishes the dark, noir aspects to Mamet's stories, style. plots, and characters and their performances.I watched the tape I have of this film again, after a pretty long time, and enjoyed it just as much. This site has many comments detailing in great length the story line, performances and setting, so would add only a bit more comment.Crouse and Mantegna are perfect in their roles, and deliver outstanding performances. A more vivacious actress (say, Sharon Stone), and handsomer leading man (say, Michael Douglas), would have been excellent as well, and both have played characters which relate to those portrayed by the leads here.Stone and Douglas are two of my absolute favorites - but in this flick, I don't think it would been as effective as it is with Mantegna and Crouse. The other actors, several recognizable, and William Macy in an early , small role, are effectively cast here, as in subsequent films by Mamet and others.A superbly entertaining and engrossing movie, and one of those enjoyed equally in subsequent viewings. It is also clever. This is a quality which many otherwise excellent films could use more of, or have in very short supply.

There's stuff like flirting, bragging (exaggerating events) and role-playing happening during almost all conversations - it's kind of a function of human nature. So when such behavior is transposed to those 'confidence' men, as it is here, we're seeing the behavior elevated to an art form - an ability by some human beings to live by way of the con. It's fascinating to watch these people use the full potential of manipulating others through such elaborate role-playing. Writer & Director Mamet creates a sub-world of shadowy manipulators and breathes strange life into them through his now-famous Mamet-style dialogue (this is an early Mamet effort). The main character (Crouse) is not a part of this world in the beginning, but she also speaks the Mamet-speech, often repeating back questions to other characters.She begins life as a successful psychiatrist who recently had a book published. There is a robotic tone to her personality and existence, and it's no surprise she seeks out an alternate venture when the possibility presents itself. Enter Mantegna as the ultimate conman, Mike - this performance basically put Mantegna on the map as far as film acting. Mantegna presents an interesting persona, at once a polished-seeming businessman-type and also a ruthless unscrupulous street hustler. He's a magnet and Crouse's character gets swept away by this new excitement pervading the fringes of her otherwise antiseptic existence. And so the game continues, with twists and turns to bedazzle the audience not expecting all the artistry of an elaborate con within the con. Mantegna's fellow con artists are also great to watch, with some tricks of the trade revealed (and one evidently specially invented just for this story) just to tantalize viewers. The ending, which I won't reveal here, of course, is pretty shocking.

First, it seemed obvious to me that Lindsay's character was being conned when the briefcase containing $80,000 went missing and Lindsay offered to reimburse the con men. Concomitantly, it didn't make sense that Lindsay's character wouldn't catch on at that point that she was being conned.Later in the movie, Lindsay visits the bar where the con men hang out.

Like Heist, Spartan or The Spanish Prisoner, the film is a card trick, Mamet setting up his rugs only to pull then out from under our feet.Mamet's films are all exercises in style, but unlike most of cinema's stylists, he sculpts entirely with the pen. He's playing with words, with syntax and rhythm, his characters often even pausing to discuss words themselves. They argue over the meaning of words, of literature, or stop to question the motivation of another character's use of a certain word. And these words are the reason to see a Mamet film. As to talk is to con and text is merely a tool for persuasion, Mamet sees cinema as the ultimate card trick.8/10- There is one sequence here in which the film's protagonist stumbles into the lair of a group of con men. As she spies on these men, we realize that this is the only moment of the film in which the characters step out of their make-believe play and speak with any sort of realism. They dump the theatrics, they drop Mamet's customary staccato, clipped dialogue style, and briefly become real people. This is a unique moment in Mamet's filmography.

This really ISN'T how therapists are trained and Mamet SHOULD have done his homework. And, the idea of a straight-laced lady with a seething volcano hidden beneath the surface also seems a little bit like a cheap romance novel.
