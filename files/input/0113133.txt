Lee Evans is absolutely haunting as the tortured comic genius, the natural comic who is so purely a comedian that he can barely communicate except in gags, yet who will never be allowed to perform in public because of his dark past. Leslie Caron is heart-rending as his mother, a brave, faded French beauty stranded for ever singing mildly risque songs in Blackpool pubs, and their tender scenes together are for me the best thing in the whole film.The whole cast is incredible...right down to Oliver Reed camping it up gloriously in a bizarre sub-plot which at first I thought might be part of the Evans' character's fevered imagination. It is a movie absolutely crammed with magic but in one of my favourite scenes, Oliver Platt arrives in Blackpool and instantly sees it peopled with characters from Donald McGill postcards - fat ladies, saucy girls with flouncy skirts, burly men. The ending is a bit wonky and looks to my eye to have been changed from a tragic one to a happy one to please audiences. In the two opening sequences, both Evans and Platt utter the words I'm going to die in very different circumstances, and mean very different things, and other variations on the theme of death and laughter follow - all this seemed to be pointing down a much darker alleyway than the one we got. Doesn't matter, though. Still a great movie.

It's a bizarre combination of humor and tragedy, of supernatural and straight drama. It's just an odd mix, but I find it very, very interesting and I've seen it three times, equally fascinated each time.The movie goes back and forth between drama and comedy which makes unsettling for some viewers, but not me. It kept me on my toes, so to speak, even with those multiple viewings. Also in here is another example of how good comedians can be in dramatic roles, in this case, veteran comic Jerry Lewis. Oliver Platt plays his son, and does an outstanding job as the main figure in this film. The comedy is really provided by others, most notably the most tragic figure in the film Jack Parker, effectively played by Lee Evans.There is really is no way to adequately explain this strange film in a few paragraphs. I would just say if you are looking for something different, give this a try. And stay with it, even if the first half hour is not to your liking. You will be rewarded.

This is a story of a broken family and hidden secrets - Tommy Fawkes goes to Blackpool, once one of the world's showbiz capitals, to learn how to be funny; once there he finds a duo (played by veteran British comics Freddie Davies and George Carl) who he thinks have stolen his famous dad's act - but are things really as they seem?  Jack Parker is a Blackpool born lad with the innate ability to be creatively humorous (Lee Evans is excellent in this role) while lacking in the social skills to survive in the real world.Against this backdrop is something about mysterious eggs which hold some mystical secret or other (giving Oliver Reed yet another strange role as the oddball Dolly).  The really interesting aspects of the story are the skeletons in the closet that bring Jack's mother (Leslie Caron) and Tommy's father (Jerry Lewis) together again.  The strongest scenes though are the ones which truly shock - the flashback outlining the tragedy that has affected Jack's life, and the final few sequences in the show arena.'Funny Bones' may be hard to fathom but I think it repays attention by giving its audience something a bit unexpected - plus some great performances along the way.

It starts off being deliberately unamusing, yet it later becomes evident that this was done not only to establish reason for the events that occur during the rest of the movie, but also to create good character development. Oliver Platt proves that he is not only a great comedic actor, but he can be just as good when he is trying NOT to be funny. His on-stage scenes early in the film were not only well-lit but also wonderfully acted and photographed. Jerry Lewis also performs a surprisingly convincing role in a startling turn from sheer comedic hilarity to a seriously dramatic role as Platt's legendary comedian father.Platt plays Tommy Fawkes, a struggling stand-up comedian trying to live up to the legacy that his famous father George Fawkes (Jerry Lewis) has created. George is now retired, and Tommy is struggling to get his career started. After yet another painful failure onstage, Tommy decides to travel back to Blackpool, England, where his family's comedy originated. The people that Tommy meets there are strangely fascinating, and Lee Evans delivers a particularly interesting performance as Jack Parker, the high energy comedian who is on the run from the law and is also George Fawkes' bastard son. His one full length comedy act is absolutely amazing to watch.As Tommy is holding auditions trying to find something funny to include in his own act back in the States, he learns more and more about the people living in Blackpool and about their history as well as some dishonorable actions of his own father, and he learns an important lesson from it all. He ultimately finds his place in the world of live acting, and the transformation from who he was at the beginning of the film to who he is at the end is incredible.Funny Bones is an excellent but very different comedy that is ultimately very rewarding and satisfying. The cinematic trickery and the skillful use of lighting add to the experience, and the acting is excellent all around. The circus scene at the end of the film was great, it was tense and amazingly well done. Although slow at times, this is a great film about overcoming obstacles and developing your own view of the world, as well as the importance of finding your rightful place in it.

Lee Evans was also unbelievably riveting in his portrayal as the mentally disturbed young man.This film is very representative of the small town in Britain with it's quiet undisturbed population that seems to be frozen in time, in contrast to Fawkes's father's life in America, which is busy and ever-changing, where the most important thing in life is money, as opposed to memories being just as important back in the small British town.The best part of the film is watching (in small parts) the unravelling of the horrific event that had happened so many years before and turned the young man (played by Lee Evans) into the person he is today.A riveting watch.

Fawkes is masterfully portrayed by Oliver Platt, an incredibly talented actor who is often placed in supporting roles. Adept at all roles, it's always refreshing to find him as our lead.  Platt has a particular gift for portraying the edgy hero, reminiscent of Karl Malden at his best.  Somehow, he manages to make Tommy dark, yet uncomplicated.In contrast, we have Jack Parker--seemingly the simplest of characters, he is the darkest and most complicated of all.  This offered many of us our first glimpse of Lee Evans, a brilliant young UK actor/comedian with an astonishing penchant for physical comedy.  His energy alone is enough to leave the viewer completely awestruck.  If Fate is kind, we should have the good fortune of seeing a great deal more of him.As for the rest of this stellar cast, Leslie Caron is charming as ever, George Carl and Freddie Davies are pure energy, and Jerry Lewis is, well, Jerry Lewis (there is no higher compliment I can pay him).Essentially, this film is a requisite for anyone who enjoys surreal, dark comedy with a philosophical edge and an often slapstick pace.

Maybe it's best not to try. Suffice to say the whole thing builds to a tense climax which could see a horrible repetition of an event from the past which we have been shown in flashback.All the performances are excellent. Oliver Platt as failed comic Tommy Fawkes looking for the special something that will make him funny looks unnervingly like Orson Welles in some scenes. Jerry Lewis as his legendary father George is full of wonderful advice. When Tommy is making his Vegas debut he tells him the room is full of people all ready for you to make them laugh - just the thing to calm dressing room nerves. I find the idea of Jerry Lewis in Blackpool a great joke in itself.There is great support from Freddie Davies and George Carl as the Parker Brothers. Formerly the top act at Blackpool Tower they are given a new lease of life (literally) and the opportunity to perform again. My one quibble with 'Funny Bones' is that throughout the film we're told how great the Parkers were, yet when they are finally on stage all we get are snippets of what looks like a terrific slapstick routine.Finally there's Lee Evans whose energy (cliche coming up) threatens to burst right off the screen. His 'Valve Radio' routine is almost too fast to be funny, while in the more dramatic phases he successfully gives Jack Parker the necessary aura of danger and unpredictability the story needs. Jack can't help being funny even when being interviewed by a psychiatrist Q Have you lived in Blackpool all your life? A Not yet. Leslie Caron looks beautiful and sophisticated as Jack's mother, Katie. While she is portrayed sympathetically we see she is far from perfect as wife or mother, (and despite the words of her song, Englishmen *do* make love in the afternoon - believe me).A film which is largely set in Blackpool can't be all bad and 'Funny Bones' is far from being all bad. Even this setting is stylised with some strange 1950's retro touches, as if Blackpool hasn't moved on for thirty years or so. I'm afraid honesty compels me to say that Blackpool is in fact dirty, tawdry, a little squalid and the sun certainly doesn't shine everyday. The entertainment centre (the 'Golden Mile') stretches along the shoreline but soon gives way to the usual Victorian terraced streets. People in the north of England like to think of it as our Las Vegas but the Lancashire coast is about as different from the Nevada desert as you can get. In this film we still seem to be seeing Blackpool through the eyes of six-year old Tommy Fawkes. And where are the trams?

I say ostensible because the movie is really an ensemble of brilliant performances.  After bombing on a Las Vegas Stage in front of all his father's friends and admirers,Tommy disappears to Blackpool, which beckons him with flashbacks of the first 6 years of his life there.  At approximately the same time, the movie shows a dramatic event taking place at sea on a vessel carrying strange contraband and where Jack Parker is shot at and dives into the sea, believing he is about to die. He surfaces along with a strange egg, one of 6 comprising the contraband.These story lines start to converge in Blackpool when an incognito Tommy, paying money to audition Blackpool's strange assorted comedic performers, encounters the Parker family, consisting of Jack Parker, a brilliant young but virtual savant idiot and suicidal comic genius, his mother, charmingly played by Leslie Caron of Gigi fame, and father and uncle.  The story enfolds in bizarre splendor from there, revealing the familial relationship between the two groups and revealing a family secret that has impacted all of their lives.But what is most engaging about the movie are the individual characters that seem almost transparent before the all-seeing camera of this film.  Jack's father and uncle are two of the saddest and deeply moving characters of any film,the actors playing them rendering brilliant performances.  The uncle has not spoken in 16 years.  When noted at one point by a psychiatrist talking Jack down from the Blackpool tower, the father explains simply, he's depressed.  Such ironies as the deeply depressed comic pervade the film.  Yet, the comic side is always imminent.  In the next scene, the psychiatrist, in a scene almost reminiscent of Monty Python, is giving Jack a psychiatric test to determine his sanity, the questions of which are absurd and Jack's explanations of the answers zanily hilarious. Interwoven into all this is the mysterious nature of the contraband which is a very effective youth elixir and which is put to unwitting use in the course of the film; and the search by the smugglers, tied into the local police, for Jack and the missing egg.  Along with all of this, we are treated to intermittent bouts of amazing physical comedy as various old-time acts are performed.  Actually, the various strands of the film are too rich to describe simply and must be seen to be experienced.  Indeed, one of the most impressive things about the film is the jumping from one slice of life to another a la John Sayles.I will not, of course, describe the ending other than to say that it is satisfying and pulls most of the strands together.  This movie will appeal to anyone who loves zany, somewhat eccentric, and highly talented, cinematic and well-scripted, movie-making.

This isn't a knock against the film--just a knock at how it was marketed. I think you should be prepared for the type of film you are about to see.Funny Bones begins with some sort of deal going bad on the water off of Blackpool, England. One man is chopped up by the blades of a boat and another is forced to jump into the water to save himself. What exactly happened and why is a complete mystery and bits and pieces of this are interspersed throughout the film.The film then very abruptly changes to Las Vegas. A terribly unfunny man, Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt), is about to make his big debut at one of the big clubs. Not surprisingly, he bombs--and folks start walking out during his act. Now this happens from time to time...but what makes it different is that the guy is the son of a legendary comedian, George Fawkes (Jerry Lewis). It's obviously difficult living in your father's shadow--especially when you aren't talented. Soon Tommy disappears--and ends up in Blackpool to see if he can buy an act for himself. Now he knows he is terrible at telling jokes--so he wants to see if he can learn physical comedy. During this process, he accidentally bumps into some folks who have a dark connection to his dad--and learns several terrible secrets about his old man. I could say a lot more, but it would spoil the film.In addition to the main plot discussed above, the plot begun at the start of the film seemed a bit dark, confusing and unnecessary--and not especially well integrated into the rest of the movie. It seemed to have VERY little to do with the Fawkes story and was choppy and seemed to get in the way of the main story--which was very compelling as I found myself wanting to see more interaction between Platt and Lewis. I also enjoyed was seeing some of the strange burlesque-style acts. Some were very funny and some were just cool. This was a nice little homage to the English acts which used to be big in Blackpool.

Oliver Platt plays the son of a famous comedian (Jerry Lewis). When his comedy act bombs, he sneaks off to Blackpool, England, to hook up with some old acquaintances and possibly assemble a better act.Despite the presence of Jerry Lewis*, this isn't any kind of silly movie at all. It has a very serious side. A major focus is how the father expects the son to follow in his path, despite the son's having a different set of talents. But all in all, what results is a very fine piece of work, definitely one that you should see. It's too bad that Peter Chelsom went on to direct Town & Country and Hannah Montana The Movie.Also starring Lee Evans (Tucker in There's Something About Mary), Leslie Caron, Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter movies), Oliver Reed and Ian McNeice.*Other serious movies in which Jerry Lewis starred are The King of Comedy by Martin Scorsese and Arizona Dream by Emir Kusturica.

The screen play is by Mr. Chelsom and Peter Fannery.The opening scenes are disorienting because we aren't prepared for what will follow in any way, but in retrospect, it makes sense because it ties in with the story in ways that a casual viewer might overlook.The biggest thing going for this film is the wonderful Lee Evans who gives a performance bigger than life and ends up stealing the film and making it his own. This young actor deserves to be seen in other films because he shows a charisma and a talent unmatched by other, more experienced actors.The other surprise was Jerry Lewis. Not being a fan of Mr. Lewis, he gives a retrained performance, much better than in some of his comedies. Leslie Caron is also excellent, although she is not seen but in a few pivotal scenes. Her Cleopatra dance shows her in great physical form. Oliver Platt, as Tommy, wins our sympathy because he bombs as a comedian in front of a Las Vegas audience.The real stars of the film are George Carl and Freddie Davies, genuine comedians, doing what they do best.

It has its standard plot, Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt) isn't funny, despite having a famously funny father (Jerry Lewis). He runs away to Blackpool where he lived until he was six and remembered that the sun shone everyday.  There, he finds the secrets of his past. There ends the plot.  Chelsem then weaves incredible magic through and around the plot with the secretive and brilliant Jack (Lee Evans) who gave up living his life to save his life; his aged uncles, The Parker Brothers (George Carl and Freddie Davies), brilliant vaudevillians in their time; and his mother Katie Parker (Leslie Caron) who links the three to reality. They have their rituals such as applauding for themselves when putting on powder. Add to these characters an ancient oriental powder for immortality.

When I saw it the first time in cinema, I really liked it, so I persuaded some friends o see it too. They were disappointed. All others I talked to about this film were not liking it too. I thought I may be the only one to find it a brilliant, deep movie but here I find more of my kind.What makes the movie so outstanding in my opinion, is the fact that it is none of Hollywood's favourite genres...in fact it can't even be categorized to one genre or two. Adding to it there is no small criticism about today's comedy and entertainment culture and how our modern society treats people not fitting in so well.All this is wrapped in a more than bizarre story about some mystic elixir hidden in wax eggs,french mariners, American comedians, family secrets, a long lost glamorous time of vaudevillian entertainment and two guys on the search of their role in life.One is Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt) the rising star of stand up comedy, son of a comedy great. Overcome with self doubt and after getting his spotlight stolen by his father, he begins looking for the heart of comedy in Blackpool, England. Many may not know this, but Blackpool, like Brighton, was once the center of cabaret and varieté culture in England. Platt delivers a great performance (I should say as often, because that he does) as the self-doubting comedian, who thinks he cannot be funny anymore.But what he lacks in comedian talent, he has in social talent. He is a natural leader and charismatic person.Then there is Jack, a guy who is born to a family of entertainers, too. He is a natural comedian, in such an extreme that he cannot interact with society on a normal level. He has somewhat of a dark past, but that gets apparent during the movie. Jack is played by Lee Evans, and this boy is FABULOUS! Look at his Radioman performance and tell me you did not laugh...i call you a liar.Both actors are surrounded by a more than strong supporting cast including Jerry Lewis, Leslie Caron and Oliver Reed.Together with its almost hauntingly sublime and beautiful cinematography this film becomes a very clever and deep movie about character development.My advice Rent it, see it and make your own opinion.

Funny bones IS a funny film (extremely funny), but it is a humour which has its routes firmly set in the tragedy of life. George Carl's only speech in the film is deliberately emphasised (His illustration that the tragedies which befall their family are the dark canvas against which the laughter and joy become brighter is deliberately given poignancy by him being the silent role up until then).This assertion is the very basis of the film. Comedy is rooted in the fear of tragedy. The film is about this tragic aspect of comedy. Tommy Fawkes is a privileged son living an extremely comfortable life yet is not inherently funny despite all the money and effort thrown into his act; his step brother (Lee Evans) has a life of almost unbearable tragedy and yet exudes comedy from every pore - he has Funny Bones.This film is beautifully set, acted and conceived.

Oliver Platt plays the unfunny son (Tommy) of an enormously successful comedian played by Jerry Lewis (George). Tommy, after a tragic debut of his stand-up comedy act in Las Vegas, goes back to his birth hometown in England in search of what is funny. In England, Tommy discovers aging vaudevillians and their quirky acts, one of which he recognizes. He then explores the family who perform this familiar act, finding more than comedy.While the film's subplot about a mystical eastern powder smuggled in large wax eggs at first appears better edited out, it provides a tenuously apt metaphor.The greatest part of this charming story comes from learning about the family and their history. And we learn of the tragedy and pathos deep within their comedy.I've always firmly believed the old tenet that the best comedy has threads of tragedy (or menace) in it. And in England, failed comic Tommy discovers this as well. As Tommy, Oliver Platt shows his own pathos from the start and is remarkable. The rest of the cast is a marvel Leslie Caron is absolutely gorgeous, especially in her man's shirt, untucked, singing a cabaret song. The procession of old vaudevillians are a delight in a montage, and Freddie Davies and George Carl as an aging brother act are a revelation, a beacon illuminating the forgotten immense talent of days gone by. But the film belongs to the remarkable talents of young Lee Evans as the perhaps dimwitted son Jack. Here, we see in Evans, and in his character, a source of comedy so organic and abundant that Jim Carrey and his characters now look utterly forced and sham. And it's a shame that Evans is not as well known worldwide as Carrey; this fact being another of comedy's tragedies. Oddly, or aptly, Jerry Lewis plays one of the most serious characters in the film because he has to confront and admit the source of his own comedy. To the Jerry Lewis-phobic audience, fear not he is actually very good here, probably because he largely, generously, takes a back seat to the more central characters. In Hitchcock parlance, Lewis' character is something of the MacGuffin that drives the larger story, and Lewis appears to understand this.The style of direction is quirky, showing much charm in the old seaside town in England that was, in some long ago day (when the sun seemed to shine every day), a center for quality vaudeville. And the viewer gets to delight in two hours' evidence of what Platt's character believes that (in my favorite line of the film), ...all the best things in life belong to the past. Overall, hardly a perfect film. Yet it's one that stays with you. There's much love, charm and laughs in this work that may leave you feeling compelled to add to your list of all-time favorites.

The movie ends with the two half brothers swinging from a high pole in front of an audience, Platt hanging in the grasp of his half brother, who says, Listen, they are beginning to like you.

I highly recommend watching this movie, which I only rated 6 out of 10, if for no other reason than to see Lee's brilliance in his role...very funny and ingenius. The rest of the aspects of the film fail to protrude beyond the enormous shadow of his talent.

I think we only wanted to see it for the quite funny performance by Lee Evans as Jack Parker. He is quite a jittery character at first and gets involved in chases, but he soon shows his excellent physical comedy to us and Platt. I can't really say that I enjoyed all of it, but the moments with Evans are the most memorable. Also starring Richard Griffiths as Jim Minty and Oliver Reed as Dolly Hopkins. What I remember of this film is okay, but the rest I think is not too interesting. Adequate, in my opinion!

He finds his half-brother, Jack Parker, while still unfunny, has inherited their father Jerry Lewis's genes (Ie. funny to the French). The father follows Tommy over, to make ammends for stealing the act he started with, but won't let poor Jack have the spotlight as well for the petty little reason that Jack is a murdering son-of-a-bitch. Silly Jerry. Well after kidnaping the policeman who is watching him, Jack gets to do his unfunny act. And apparently, the inhabitants of Blackpool are all French and love his shenenigans. Cheering because he doesn't kill Oliver in the process.. YAY!!! My Grade D+  "}]
