Am I glad I did. The film is quite unconventional in that it is not a strict biopic in any sense of the word. The film -- much like the title suggests -- takes 32 vignettes that concern some aspect of GG's life. Gould, a Canadian classical pianist, was by all accounts an unusual yet charming man. A merciless hypochondriac who popped pills incessantly and wore heavy clothing even in the middle of summer, Gould was also enormously talented, both as a pianist and a producer of highly unusual radio programs. The film examines Gould's life, his passions, his obsessions, and of course his music. The soundtrack is breathtaking. Colm Feore portrays the enigmatic Gould brilliantly. If you are a fan of daring, original films -- as well as a Gould fan -- you will not want to miss this.

When I first saw this film, I thought, oh! THAT'S why people like it.

The music is certainly the most important aspect of the film, but it so strongly highlights the character of Gould (who was one wacky Canuck), and the cinematography, that as a package, I found it a moving experience that superceded the music.Basically a series of vignettes, with no coherent plot, but rather snippets of docu-drama, interviews, and a couple of animated sequences (one quite good, the other detracts entirely from the whole), this is a film meant probably not for fans of classical, but an introduction to the possibilities and drama of the virtuoso for media-children.Although primarily another crazy genius film, it is truly a stunning piece overall. I strongly recommend this for any collection, no matter one's musical inclinations.Although primarily another crazy genious film, it is truly a stunning piece overall.

What better way to breathe life into a musician's 'story' than rhythmically assembling a collection of several recreated happenings, bits of documentary conversation, and performances of actual musical pieces (orchestrated works of Gould's) that each examine a particular instance from Glen Gould's life? By avoiding a typical diluted overview of the artist's entire timeline of events, Girard instead picks out specific happenings in Gould's life that each tells a story of a complex, confused, and brilliant man.  These shorts are shown in a somewhat chronological order, so as not to completely ignore the fact that the collection of shorts aims to sculpt a more complete picture of Gould.  Their consecutive placement being rhythmically conscious, the viewer is never lost in the experimental efforts or the non-narrative spectrum of the shorts, as they are closely followed by the more tangible aspects of Gould's life.  Aesthetic elements from Gould's creative life are often carried over from one short to the next, which helps reinforce the unity as a whole of the 32 separate films.  One of the most important aspects this structure brings to its audience is freeing them from the typical passive role.  Instead of loosing yourself into a 2 hour story that tries its hardest to make it's viewer forget their lives, troubles, and identities by sweeping them into a fantasy world, the constant breathes between these short episodes remind the audience what they're seeing more resembles a diary from the artist rather than an alternate reality to 'forget oneself' in.Aside from the highly effective (and I believe far more suitable) structural effort of the film, the camera's language combined with the film's language is very conventional (aside from the sound editing in several cases).  At times, the extremely literal usage of visual imagery falls a little flat, but it also works within its context in particular cases.  Other innovations in the film stem from the content chosen (or even more so, what the filmmaker chooses not to show in several of the shorts).  An excellent film for those who are humbled at the overwhelming confusion even the brilliant can carry.

Here's why...","Date":"16 September 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" I realize that this is a well made film, and many people, Gould fans or not, enjoyed it very much. But on the chance that someone out there is on the same wavelength as me, I'll tell you why I didn't like it.The film paints the picture of a self-absorbed, eccentric oddball... a bit arrogant and presumptuous (like when he grabs a lowly chambermaid and makes her listen to one of his records as a sort of reward for her day's work). The Glenn Gould character always speaks in a supercilious New England tone of voice (think Frazier but without the jokes). He says phrases like never the twain shall meet. If you're like me, you might have a healthy mistrust of people who say twain unless they're talking about Huck Finn. Maybe you can guess the problem unless you're already convinced that Glenn Gould is god's gift to Carnegie Hall, the film offers no motivation to like him.This could have been EASILY remedied by showing a performance to earn the audience's respect. It could have been an archival clip, or even a semi-convincing pantomime by the actor playing Gould if done convincingly would have made me take the character more seriously. But we never get that. So the result is a whole bunch of people telling us how great he is, including the Diva himself. It gets irritating.I feel like the real Glenn Gould was cheated. Here is a film, purportedly in honor of a great musician, which never shows him being a musician. Instead we get a lot of ponderous scenes of (the actor playing) Glenn as he walks across frozen lakes, or sits in a chair unmoving with an intense expression on his face, or waving his arms dramatically in the air while listening to the playback of one of his recordings. People around him are made to look like simpletons for not being on the same supernatural level as Gould. They chatter about coffee or gardening while the maestro slips further away into a lofty dreamworld that we mortals cannot dare understand. The entire film thus takes a very condescending air, telling us that Gould was a misunderstood genius yet not offering to show us what exactly was genius about him.I read that the actor playing Glenn chose not to be shown playing the piano out of respect for Mr. Gould. Could someone please explain that to me? It's OK to act like someone being a goofy oddball dancing to invisible pianos in his head, but it's somehow disrespectful to portray him actually playing one?I was not familiar with Glenn Gould before I watched this, and 90 minutes later I'm still completely clueless. Even worse, I'm not particularly inclined to learn more. I believe this film is great for people who are already fans of Gould, or perhaps casual fans of classical music as a whole. Me, I'm a hardcore classical music fan who never happened to hear Glenn Gould (there are so many amazing musicians out there, it happens).If I were to list the best musical documentaries & biopics I've seen, they would be Standing in the Shadows of Motown about the unsung studio musicians who made it happen, Anvil! The Story of Anvil a hilarious and heartfelt documentary about a bunch of aging rockers who never say die, and of course the masterpiece Amadeus which, like this film, shows the maestro as an arrogant oddball, but it shows powerful musical performances which instantly earn our respect and interest. Really, just one lousy performance would've made all the difference, but alas I can't say this movie impressed me.

Depending on your vocabulary these are neurotics and psychotics; heads and hearts; numeralists and geometers; fatalists and cocreators and so on. Whatever terms you like to use, Gould is in the first of these, and that reflects his approach to music. Bach is also.Bach's music is highly mathematical, almost mechanically so. Stripped of emotion, it is pure in an abstract, cosmic sense. Gould's approach to music (and life -- not an incidental overlap) is neurotic, highly charged, anticipative, brilliantly logical, nimble. This mix -- together with a relatively more common virtuosity with the instrument -- makes Gould the best performer of Bach we have. His animation of the mathematics is always ahead of our own perception, so it makes the mathematics seem more alive. Not real life, but the kind of life we see in animated spheres.Contrast this with another world entirely, say Rubenstein (or Argerich!) and Chopin. This music is human, rooted not in some abstract aether, but in the soul. It is not clever, but real. It is not golden, but tearful, sweaty. It deals not with celestial mechanics, but with yearnings. Not with precision but with hesitations and local attractions. Not with planetary gravity but the emotional kind.Myself, I consider the latter to be true music, the life-altering kind. The former is brilliant decoration, also perhaps interesting technically. And that's the problem with this film it emulates the Bach notion of little snapshot explorations. Each one is crafted to be technically brilliant; each one has some conceptual relationship with its neighbors. The sum triangulate the matter, giving a totality of external but abstract and distant probes.But the method lacks soul, and the subject here does too. We are intrigued by his eccentricities, but never invest in his being, because he doesn't have one in the musical sense. He has washed it away.For myself, I have to relegate this film to the huge stack of failed attempts to give us a film about music that has the same power, and type of power, as that music. It may be too hard an endeavor, but in this case the enterprise fails because the subject is in the wrong half of humanity.

Directors usually resort to depicting those troubled geniuses, such as Van Gogh and Michelangelo, who had vivid and turbulent lives, even then the resulting film is often lamentable. Glenn Gould may have been a genius, and may have had more than his fair share of eccentricities but it requires something special to make a powerful and strange film about an over-intellectual pianist. Francois Girard's 'Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould' is certainly special, and often dazzling. Of course it will not appeal to those who like blockbuster type films, or to those who can't read without moving their lips, it requires an intelligent, informed and attentive audience (which pretty much rules out the vast majority of the cinema-going public) but not one that is especially interested in classical music. Anyone who is interested in the creative spirit in man or in experimental film-making will I think find this a wonderful film.Just fifteen years after its release the film now seems to have been completely forgotten. The fact that, at the time of writing, it is not yet available in Europe on a DVD seems a terrible indictment of the current state of the money-obsessed, Hollywood-driven film marketing industry.

Each short film is a piece of a puzzle that spans childhood to old age. While the styles vary from narrative to abstract, one constant is the hypnotic beat of Gould's genius fingers across the keyboard.Though I don't know a lot about classical music, this film made me hungry to learn more. There's a lovely scene where a hotel chambermaid falls spell to one of Gould's dazzling recordings.

Over the years, I've listened to nearly every recording there is, repeatedly. That said, I had trouble watching this movie. The first time I tried, I quit after five minutes. Last evening, I made it all the way through. While at times moving, the film disturbs.For one, it does not do visual justice to the music. Bach's compositions are not about waving hands in the air, geometry animations, or men walking off into infinity. They're complex literary statements. This variety of music is akin to the best silent cinema; it says volumes, but without words. Like pantomime, it tells a nuanced story, weaving multiple plot lines together into an evocative fabric. Few of the 32 vignettes approached that ideal. Could it be that some of Bach's greatest admirers fail to grasp the deeper meaning within the music? In addition, Gould's personal faults grate on the nerves. It's clear he wasn't an ideal specimen. He mistook music for life. Music is a condiment, a catalyst perhaps. It frames life, drawing attention to worthy matters. It spices and enlivens life, making it savory. But it is not life. His mind was filled with picture frames, but no pictures. He fell in love with music in the same way that parrots sometimes mistakenly bond with their human owners. They are not parrots, and music is not a woman. One wonders how Bach might greet Gould in heaven So, the bachelor thinks he understands the man with two wives and twenty children?

He hummed along while playing, and was totally unaware of this quirk. The recording engineers were driven insane by this habit which can be heard on the final product.He was also a hypochondriac, constantly taking his own blood pressure and several medications simultaneously, which he chronicled in a diary.Some of the one to six minute segments are recreations, and others are interviews with people who knew him.

It does start a little slow, and the first few 'shorts' can come off as a bit ... well, pretentious, to be blunt. But past that, it's a fantastic portrait of an interesting character, and one which satisfies on a number of levels --- creatively, intellectually, and even emotionally.What sets this film aside from many others are two main elements; the first is the novelty by which the film is presented 32 short films, some of which are quite the same, but many of which are unexpected blasts of what can only be called 'experimental film'--- some of which seems almost silly, given how far technology and special effects have come since 1993. The 'films' really are quite short, and many of them are almost like small 'puzzles' which unfold so quickly that it's not until a second viewing that their underlying message becomes a bit more obvious, and it becomes clear how well-tied together all the shorts are. This is not short-attention span theatre, but it moves quick enough that once you get into the film, it's difficult to stop watching.The other element which makes this film so great is the basic premise, and the way in which it refuses to be dumbed down for the audience. This is the rare case of a movie that respects it's audience, even at the expense of losing half an audience by not being bombastic and overly obvious. The first few shorts are the weakest, but they establish the basic character and 'backstory' of Gould quite well He's a piano virtuoso who has become so amazing at playing piano that calling him 'genius' is a bit of an understatement. And while his character has a definite surplus of eccentricities and quirks, this film doesn't focus on his genius as we're used to seeing films treat the subject. Whereas most films make out a person;s genius to be a heavy burden to carry, which always seems to come at a high cost and lead to a desire for normalacy (to make we in the audience feel better for not being geniuses, I suppose), 32 Short Films goes in another direction Here's a genius who enjoys being who he is, who makes the most of his mostly self-imposed loneliness by turning it into art, who enjoys the intellectual challenge of his own conflicts with intellectual society. Rather than the familiar portrait of genius as a soul-crippling condition which becomes almost indistinguishable from minor autism, we see a full human being, realized and thoughtful, able to confuse the sometimes-adoring, sometimes-confrontational media by admitting that he doesn't think it's worth talking about music--- how about talking about Indian rights, or the supernatural, or something that has no ostensible connection to music or anything piano-related? If you play music, or if you are an aficionado of classical music, there's a whole depth to this film which you'll enjoy, although it's not as at the forefront of the film as you might suspect. This is not a film about music, but the sort of person who plays music, recognizable as a character APART from the skill which defines him so much for everyone else.This movie is a bit dated. That's really one thing it has working against it in some sense--- it feels at times like a movie from the 80's, and not in a 'cool 80's' way. Nonetheless, there's a certain air to the film which seems to disregard any particular age entirely, and this makes sense in a way, because Gould was clearly not one to feel confined to the age, and the ways in which things were being done.There are so many things that are tempting to say about this film, which are probably just my own interpretations and conclusions, which it's probably better not to go into, simply because half the enjoyment of this film is developing those realizations yourself. Even if you can't stand classical music, you'll find this film rewarding.Highly recommended.

Glenn Gould was a Canadian concert pianist. When he was thirty-two he announced he would no longer perform live concerts. Instead he would record and broadcast only, as he saw the performance hall as an elitist and obsolete means of presenting music. He was the first noted classical performer to abandon formal performance attire, something radical at the time, opting for a business suit rather the traditional black tie and tails. But his ideas extended beyond performance sites and attire to the very nature of art, challenging the hierarchical distinction between artist and audience. He wanted creative listening as well as creative performing. And like many geniuses he was full of peculiarities and paradoxes.He would usually grant interviews only over the phone, and as Yehudi Menuhin said, created his own life and led it to the exclusion of the rest of the world, doing nothing but applying himself to his physical and intellectual work. He was a perfectionist in his recording and his music, yet would hum as he played and record with little regard for things like a squeaky chair or pianos with noisy works. He was a man who cherished solitude, but would talk for hours on the phone and is remembered as a kind and compassionate man. He disdained violence and competition. As a child he serenaded cows in a pasture; upon his death he left half his estate to the SPCA, the other half to the Salvation Army.One of the many things this movie does well is to integrate actors portraying people, incidents and possibilities with real people speaking their own thoughts. A piano tuner, a chambermaid, an agent, cousin Jessie Norman and others talk about Glenn Gould. In one segment we see the depiction of the final moments before his last concert. Immediately following, Yehudi Menuhin speaks insightfully about Gould's reasoning behind discontinuing public concerts and elaborates on Gould's mindset. Menuhin's appearance makes the previous dramatization seem as real as cinema verité.A Sociologist recalled being interviewed on the Canadian radio system by Glenn Gould. It was a very penetrating interview, the most intelligent questions I think I've heard about the North, from experts, laymen, or anything else ... questions that required rather long answers and as I would start to speak or make a point, he would register his feelings not by voice, but by a smile ... All the time he was using his hands and conducting. And this was perhaps slightly off-putting when you're trying to think deep thoughts, because I had no idea what this was all about. He was continuously waving his hands, sort of as if to bring up this idea or so on ... I was his orchestra for that hour. And throughout the 32 Films, we see that conducting the sound in his world is no affectation, but an indication of how deeply attentive Gould's perceptions and musical sensibilities run.In Truck Stop we witness Glenn Gould listening in on ambient conversations at the diner, subtly and almost surreptitiously moving a forefinger in concert with a conversation as it swells, subsides and blends with the other conversations and sounds throughout the highway restaurant. Such is just one example of the film's subtle yet magnificently effective structure, linking several of the short films, in this case by displaying Glenn Gould's compulsion to conduct sound, whether while listening to an interviewee, a Beethoven sonata, or to the conversations at a truck stop.Glenn Gould seemed to focus on sound as intently as a Zen monk would attend to his breath during meditating. As a child he listened voraciously to the radio. As an adult he played the radio even while he slept; in fact he could not sleep without the radio turned on. He was always listening. We know that sound conveyed extra meaning to Glenn Gould. After watching this movie it seems to me that he heard so much, he was compelled to organize it into music at least in part because he could not ignore it. He seemed to hear no sound in isolation. I have to believe he could hear no silence.One of Gould's driving passions was solitude. He considered it to be a necessary element in the human equation and an important condition for nurturing the creative process. He linked the idea of solitude with the far North and explored it in an innovative radio format, a sound documentary, called, The Idea of North. In the movie, the short film The Idea of North immediately follows Truck Stop, showing us some of the inspirational link to the radio production. As in Truck Stop, we first hear a single voice talking, which is then joined by other voices that mingle and intertwine as musically as a string quintet of voices.This movie may not change your life, but it made me more elated and optimistic about the world than any movie I can remember. It woke up some of my curiosities and gave me a renewed shot of vitality. It made me think about how a person can use his capabilities and ingenuity to a creative purpose and how much better we all are for it. It reminded me that solitude need not be dark and lonely but can be fodder for the joy of creative imagination; that we need not have the artistic genius of a Glenn Gould to justify our efforts, nor a Bach cantata every Sunday morning to hear music. We have our own eyes and ears to use and our own curiosity to explore. Many drops make an ocean, and as Shakespeare said, Sweet are the uses of adversity.

This film took thirty-two vignettes that concern some aspect of Glenn Gould's life. Vignette is that in theatre and script writing, these are short, impressionistic, scenes that focus on one moment or gives one impression about a character, an idea or a setting. Each of these thirty-two shorts are glimpses into the life of Gould, they are like puzzle pieces that we, because of the non-linear aspects, are forced to piece together the life of Gould. It was 32 shorts that were all different from each other, which helped to bring out the theme. It is possibly named after a musical piece that Gould did an interpretation on, Bach's Goldberg Variations. Because these vignettes are broken up into various sections it was more interested than if it were linear. The shorts demand out attention in order to make connections between the disassociation of these clips. In order for us to understand the irrational we must use the irrational thought to explain it.I think that this was done beautifully in Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould. We are drawn in to the film by the various clips and the beautiful music that we hear. The beat of the video draws us to want to learn about this man who in this documentary tells his own story. This man seems to interview himself. He holds his interviews by telephone. While he is on a phone conversation he talks through out the night to himself while the person on the other side of the line has fallen asleep. On a play of what was going on, he would introduce his own thoughts by asking himself a question, and then he acted out the answer. This helped us to understand who he was and helped us look at him subjectively.This man was a genius, in his musical abilities many were awed. It could be said that isolation can breed genius but genius can breed isolation. Is it possible that this is what happened to Gould? Who knows what could have been going on in his mind? An outward appearance that we get of him is his clothes. He would wear layers of clothes even in the summer time to prevent from catching a cold. There is a short where we see all the various pills Gould was taking trying to balance each other out shown in various shapes, sizes, and color.The music that we hear is what connected Gould to the rest of the world but at the same time it kept him separated from it. Technology was able to help Gould perfect his music. There is a clip where Gould is in a recording studio and we are listening to a play back of a recording he just made. He says that after listening to it that it is almost good. The recording seems to takes the soul out of music. He decides that he wants to re-record the track, so he prepares to play, but we don't see him play. The show is about a piano player but we never saw him playing the piano. It is possible that he hated the instrument that he is most known for. You would think that since this is a documentary about a piano player that you would get to see him play, but you don't. Is this out of respect for him, he is so into his music that it was about him and not his music. It could also be that the film is not about him but about who he was. A genius mind is very complex and often difficult or hard to understand. I think the film does well to try and portray the randomness of a genius mind in the style of non-linear film where we are forced to use our own minds to make the connections in the life of Glenn Gould.

At first, I thought that the non-linear bit would wind up just being a gimmick, but I am happy to say my assumption was quite incorrect. If one is willing to put some effort into the film, rather than simply viewing it and really think about each film and its connection to the next short, there is some great content. My personal favorite was Hamburg. It's all about the closing line in that one. If you haven't seen it, stop and think about this one in particular if you do. When you understand it, you'll get a great feel of how the film works. At times, though, it did get a bit tedious. Some shorts were not as interesting to watch--interesting to think about, though. All in all, I recommend it to anyone who has a little bit of time to think about it afterward, because that's where the satisfaction comes from.

These pieces reflect many aspects of his character form his joy of music ( dancing in the recording studio) to his daily pill regime.  Colin Feore is convincing as the tormented Gould. I also like the fact that people who knew Gould were interviewed. Computer graphics make several pieces stimulating and the story of how he played the stock market to his advantage is fascinating. Rent it for the music and find a complex man who made Bach's music talk to me on a personal level.

I have never seen a film take on philosophical ideas as complex as Gould's and convey them so clearly and skillfully before; though he was very eccentric, it is difficult to walk away from this film without understanding his eccentrecity and its contribution to his achievements.

Being a fan of Gould and loving the music of Bach, I was totally fascinated during the entire film, and wished for thirty-two more opportunities to peer into the life of this incredible musician. He was obsessed with his health, and had weird views, but he played Bach like an angel.

In its heart, 32 Films wants to be an Errol Morris documentary when it grows up. And while there's nothing wrong with that desire, what we see on screen is a thin gruel that fails to match Morris's ability to turn a subject &#150; about whom most know nothing &#150; into a fascinating, complex and problematic creature. The film's failing is particularly unfortunate, as the bits of Glenn Gould's life that we can thresh out of the superficial psychologizing and imagined scenes of what purport to be critical moments in Gould's life make him seem like an ideal subject for documentary treatment. Here, Gould comes off as simply a delightfully strange bachelor uncle, a sainted `eccentric of the people' a holy fool who is civil to stagehands and hotel chambermaids, waves his hands around in recording studios and reads hagiographic radio monologues on Canada's frozen north. His genius, far more than this sum of his press myths, is what would have made for a worthwhile filmed biography.  "},{"Title":"Moments of Connection","Date":"14 February 2003","Score":"4 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  If Ludwig van Beethoven could create thirty-two piano sonatas, then Francois Girard can craft thirty-two short films--using as his subject, Canadian pianist Glenn Gould.Certainly the late pianist was extraordinarily gifted, of that there is no doubt. Unfortunately for the world of music, he emitted a somewhat negative vibration, which tended to diminish rather than enhance those great works his prodigious talent allowed him to execute.One of the most disappointing aspects of Gould's taste was his obvious love of Bach.  True, the pianist could perform Bach's piano works with great technical flair; for this listener, though, the result only occasionly touched their core. Because only a few musicians can negotiate the challenging contrapuntal writing on a technical level, Gould was automatically a member of an exclusive club.  Also, due to the gross elitism fostered by the European tradition, which was transported to both America and Canada in their formative years, a skewed consciousness was born and developed in the new land, which continues to this day.The great composers created works of great beauty based upon their own rich human experiences.  In the case of Bach, it was between him and his God.  Nowhere was there an idea of box seats and peanut galleries, of aristocrats and plebians or other hierarchical designations which tend to separate people.  To be a great composer one has to be great human being; the same qualification applies to those musicians qualified to perform these works.Bach's inspiration was truly that; it came from within, the result of a deep spiritual knowingness.  Gould's world is one of ego manifestations, quirks, eccentricities, frustrations and the like.  Bach's master was truly expression, with technique being the servant.  Gould, because of his spiritual limitation, could only achieve Bach's ultimate level intermittently.                    The end result of Gould's performance was, like this movie about him, a mixed bag.  True, prodigies are rare and publicly lauded.  There is much to appreciate on a technical level, yet music in its highest form is greater than that.  It transcends the ego to reach the higher self with its awesome power.  This value is merely glimpsed occasionally in the work of both Gould and Girard in this filmwork. "}]
