My grandma got it for me when I was little and I remember making her watch it with me almost every day--sometimes two or three times in the same day. Then somehow I lost the tape, and although I still remembered and loved the movie, I forgot just how magical it really was. Then finally, (after years of I wonder what happened to...) I found it. I realize now that in finding it I not only rediscovered a part of myself, but a beautiful world I forgot existed.I admit that I am still waiting for a luck dragon to come and take me home to Fantasia. I belong there. A part of me lives there and so does a part of everyone, although they may not be aware of it. This is without a doubt the most beautiful movie ever made (although Legend comes close) and its message will never die as long as people hold on to their dreams. Barret Oliver's performance as Bastian still makes me cry. He speaks to that part of all of us that is not afraid to do what we dream. Noah Hathaway was perfect for the part of Atreyu. He is one of the most beautiful and realistic heroes ever depicted. And Tami Stronach as the Childlike Empress (Moon Child) remains one of the most beautiful characters ever to grace the screen. The acting is wonderful, and the background scenery is breathtaking.But the Neverending Story is more than just a movie. It speaks to that part in all of us that will never let go of our dreams. It is a story that will never end as long as there are people to appreciate its message. Everyone should see this movie and remember Fantasia IS real. And Fantasia can arise in you.

Overall, it's a wonderful children's film marred by an inconsistent tone and an unsatisfying ending.No fantasy film I've seen has tapped more successfully into the kinds of philosophical thoughts that kids have. Think of Rockbiter's speech describing the Nothing A hole would be something. Nah, this was nothing. And it got bigger, and bigger, and bigger.... This is the type of film that greatly appeals to introspective kids who think about things like infinity and the end of the universe. Do children really think about such things? I did. People who find that surprising have forgotten how profound children can sometimes be.The whole of Fantasia, indeed, seems to be built out of children's dreams and fears. Some of it is about exhilaration, as when Atreyu rides Falkor. Others reflect anxiety, as in Atreyu's trek through the Swamps of Sadness. What appealed to me most as a kid was how an imaginative but passive child, sort of a young Walter Mitty, opens up a book in which an older, braver version of himself goes on adventures. But Neverending Story isn't so much escapism as it is about escapism. It's essentially a fable about the destruction of a child's fantasy world as he grows older and adapts to the modern world.The special effects are good for their day. Although they look phony at a few points, the film's distinct visual look, from the shimmering Ivory Tower to the assortment of weird creatures, holds up well today. What makes the film work especially well is that the two child stars--Barret Oliver and Noah Hathaway--prove themselves capable actors. I use the word capable because almost everyone in the film overacts in an annoying way, which I blame primarily on the director. But there's a wonderful cameo by Gerald McRaney as Bastian's father. He has the perfect tone for the scene, appearing loving but distant, unable to fathom Bastian's mind. I wish the film had followed through by returning to their relationship at the end and exploring how Bastian changes as a result of his experiences in Fantasia.The reason the ending doesn't work is obvious to anyone who's read the book. Simply put, the movie shows only the first half of the book! While this isn't the movie's fault entirely--there was no way the entire story could have fit into one movie--this could have been handled better. The Wizard of Oz faced the same problem yet managed not only to become one of the greatest fantasy movies of all time but to surpass its source material in some ways. The Neverending Story doesn't accomplish that feat. The story feels unresolved at the end while at the same time failing to clearly set up for a sequel. It attempts to wrap everything up with a sequence in which Bastian takes revenge on his old bullies. I enjoyed this scene when I was a kid, but in retrospect it creates a clash between the real world and the fantasy world. Bastian never grows as a character, he never learns to put his feet on the ground, something the early scenes suggest will happen.There's one other problem, and that's that Wolfgang Petersen never really figured out the proper tone for a children's movie. He must not have had a clear idea what age he was shooting for. Some of the scenes are quite scary and violent, making this film inappropriate for younger children. Yet the muppet-like characters are presented in an annoyingly condescending way that I doubt older kids (not to mention teens and adults) would appreciate. For example, the first scene in Fantasia plays like a revival of Sesame Street, with Rockbiter filling the Cookie Monster role. By the time I was old enough to appreciate the deeper aspects of the story, I cringed at the film's cutesy moments. Petersen didn't have to direct the film this way. Had he shot for a wider age group, the result would have been fresher and more authentic for everyone.

Bastian (Barett Oliver) is having a hard time getting over his mother's death & spends most of his time in dreamland. His teachers & father want him to get serious, & he's a constant target for bullies. Hiding out from them 1 morning in an old bookshop, he meets Coreander (Thomas Hill), the reclusive owner who piques his curiosity about the book he's reading, but warns it's not safe. Since Bastian loves reading, he borrows the book, The Neverending Story. Reading it in hiding, he glimpses Fantasia, an incredible world of rock-biters, night hobs, gnomes, a Child-like Empress who's dying of a mysterious illness. The quest to find a cure is appointed to Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), a young warrior who goes through amazing journeys. Bastian becomes more wrapped up in this book than any other he's read, sharing Atreyu's sadness & horror. What he doesn't realize is that he himself is in the plot of the book - he must choose a new name for the Empress. As Bastian tries to follow the characters' adventures & to choose whether he can do his task, you'll become entranced w/the characters and touching plot. The movie shows fantasy is a big part of reality, & it's important! Watch for yourself, & BELIEVE!

The fact is, nothing ever really ends, and thusly, someone had to say so. That's what this movie does, and it does it ever so elegantly. A young boy, who knows so much about the Lord Of The Rings, and Beowulf is about to find out something more real as he borrows a mystical book he finds enchanting. the even more powerful fact, is that once the book is opened, it will never close. Just as life never really ends on this earth, neither to stories. The book, titled The Never Ending Story, is about Fantasia, a world that is dying, and an unbelievably horrifying substance known as The Nothing, is enclosing it. A young warrior must face the danger of finding a cure. On earth, or in the book, life is intertwined to reach the ultimate answer to a young boys fears, and a young warriors quest. Film is full of some really lovable characters such as Falkor, the luck dragon, and the Rock Biter. Then, there is the Gmorg, whom I believe, is the most wretched creature in cinema. That thing is scary! In any case, film starts out as colorful and mystical, and grows dark and nightmarish with every scene, leading to a wonderful message about the substance that keeps Fantasia , and every other world out there, alive. Beautiful, just beautiful. A classic.

The NeverEnding Story is a truly remarkable movie experience. A stunning and unique movie with this fantastic feeling and the feeling of being something out-of-this-world. The finest fantasy movie of all time. A timeless and nostalgic classic.The rich production is notorious in so many ways the gorgeous settings and landscapes/sceneries; the amazing special effects, visual effects and blue-screen effects; the magic; the spectacular combination of sounds, which impress even more if heard loud; the music...Another major strength is the wonderful soundtrack, work of Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger, with that genial synthpop orientation. It's so 80's and I very much welcome that. The songs are all beautiful. Another great song is Limahl's Never Ending Story, as well as the two lovely Tami Stronach's singles Fairy Queen and Riding on a Rainbow. It's impressing how she sings so well.The movie is thrilling, very involving, exciting, great fun, contains lots of adventure, danger, strong suspense, darkness, drama, strong emotions, fantastic and strange creatures, interesting and well developed characters and a great cast.There are strange and fantastic creatures such as the Racing Snail, the creepy Gmork, Morla the ancient one, the friendly Rockbiter (a gentle giant), the Sleepy Bat and Falkor the luckdragon. I like Falkor very much he's so big, so cool, so fluffy, so cute and so friendly. He also has a great sense of humor and his dog-like appearance makes him irresistible.Other interesting characters are the somewhat rude Nighthob, Teeny Weeny, the hilariously typically grumpy old man Mr. Koreander, the eccentric and amusing gnomes Engywook and Urgl, Cairon and especially Atreyu (and his horse Artax), Bastian and the Childlike Empress. Atreyu, Bastian and the Childlike Empress are all terrific kids. Atreyu is a different kind of hero a true hero child, which is unusual and amazing. Bastian himself is another hero child.The movie is promising since the very beginning, with those stunning, dazzling and colorful clouds, which bring it a magical touch. The beauty of the Ivory Tower palace, the golden of the Sphinxes and the blue of the Southern Oracle are also magical details about this movie, among many others. On the other hand, the storm called The Nothing is spectacular but slightly creepy. Nevertheless, it is another precious help to give magic and beauty to the film. Not to mention details like the sky full of stars and no clouds and when the sky has clouds...It's amazing how one gets involved into the story. While watching the movie, one can feel deeply involved in the story as much as Bastian does. It's impossible to ignore it because it captures one's attention and heart. Also, one can't help but get deeply involved in Atreyu's quest and everything he confronts to save Fantasia, including his emotions and despair.The actors are all wonderful. Barret Oliver is amazing as the shy and imaginative Bastian, Noah Hathaway is awesome in the role of the young warrior Atreyu and Tami Stronach is terrific as the Childlike Empress. Her role is minor but very relevant and significant. She really looked like a little princess by portraying the Childlike Empress. It's kinda surprising that this was her only movie role ever. Noah Hathaway... that long hair really fitted very well on him and his character Atreyu resembles an Indian, but only a little bit.The NeverEnding Story is more than one of the greatest movies from the 80's. It is one of the best, most beautiful, magical and distinguish movies ever. A fine movie with a very good message as well. I can positively say that Mr. Wolfgang Petersen knew what he was doing. This is his masterpiece.The movie is a German production filmed in English with mostly American and English actors. The majority of the film takes place in Germany. And it was officially launched under its original title, Die Unendliche Geschichte, despite being filmed in English. By the way, I was born in 1984 and I'm very proud that this movie is from that year. After all, it's a movie that I love.This should definitely be on Top 250.

Twenty-eight years later, I have just bought the Blu-Ray and after watching it again, I liked but less that I remember.The state of art especial effects in 1984 is now dated and the acting is only reasonable. But the story of the coming of age by force of a boy that sees his innocence lost due to the death of his mother and bullying at school has a beautiful message in the end and is still worthwhile watching it.

There were legal wranglings with the book author who hated the screenplay (and it kind of shows in the finished product). The ending is abrupt and screams that the budget ran out.Really though, it works because of Noah Hathaway's on-screen presence. For sure, some of his acting is a little shaky, but this must have been a *huge* project for an eleven year old to carry. I imagine there must have been a lot of pressure on the kid at the time.He is, to put it simply, beautiful. I think the fact that he looks so androgynous is no accident - the director must very much have wanted him to look that way. Long before Peter Jackson brought his fantastic Tolkien adaptations to the big screen, I remember thinking that Atreyu/Noah looked very much how I imagined Tolkien's Elves would be - sort of too perfect and almost in-human in a way.Basically Noah single handedly carries this whole movie - along with some nice set pieces (swamp / oracle) and matte painting art work (which was very good for its time).But the story? Am I the only one here who gets the irony of a story about the power of reading and imagination being made into an Americanised movie for a popcorn audience? And what is with that ending? Completely inappropriate, hurried and nonsensical after the previous hour and a half.Lets be honest here folks, the source material is no great work of literature either, even if it was a best-seller in Germany (popular with adults and children). The message is about a subtle as being hit over the head with a plank of wood, and reads as rambling neo-romantic sentimental prattle. Do what you wish? Err, more than a little naive applied to most of the population of planet Earth I think!So watch it for the extraordinary Atreyu, for the visuals, and if you're my age, to remember your childhood.But there are no great insights into the meaning of life here (or in the book either).And please Hollywood, can you now just leave it the hell alone? Two crappy sequels, some lame cartoons and a re-imagined TV series?  Does the word originality mean anything to anyone out there in la-la land? Move on please!

In an age where CGI rules nearly every movie, and pop culture references are to be scattered within every scene in order to create a bit of a norm with the audience, this film does the exact opposite, by creating no silly dialog based off of some other film, or referencing some famous TV show or popular song, this is what fantasy should be today, but sadly, is falling apart with every new Shrek and Hoodwinked out on the market.The scenes that give off the most powerful emotional responses to me are the ones when the world tends to look chaotic, destroyed and nearly moments away from their destruction. The creatures in the film, such as the Rock Biter and Falkor are the greatest examples of why making creatures for movies with good old fashioned foam rubber and some animatronics instead of CGI really go a long way. The magic Atreyu experiences with his interaction with these two creatures is a lot better than watching the child actor trying to imagine the creature in front of him. Working with CG, people's eyes wander because they cannot see the creature, with the characters in this movie acting with puppets, there's more response and emotion than trying to act with something that's not there.The last few minutes are the most emotional to me. The Princess is simply a cute little girl who knows what the problem is, but it's a bit different than just saying it.Yes, the acting on Bastian's part is a bit bad, and the ending is a bit weak, and the editing is pretty poor, compared to other movies, but you know what? I loved this movie. I didn't know what was going to happen next. I had tears in my eyes during the swamp of despair, I got emotional when the princess yelled for Bastion and I had little tears for the ending theme.People probably look at this movie as outdated, I think it's fresher than anything out to date. From the beginning song by Limahl (Check for Kajagoogoo from the 80's) to the ending with Bastion yelling Yeah!, it's an absolute treat.Give Shrek a break, grab this movie instead.

An entertaining and vivid fantasy story with a good hero.But only if you haven't read the book, which is way beyond in regard to characters, storyline and its message which has been evaporated in the film and twisted beyond recognition.I remember seeing this film when it came out and I was immediately disappointed. Sure, at first things like Atreju's skin colour not being green, Chairon not being an actual centaur, the Nothing being represented by storm and earthquakes bugged me most.But even I knew that the ending, Bastian's first wish, was really abysmal. In the film Bastian turns out to be a not the creative but insecure boy of the book but a being filled with nothing but vengeance. If everything had been fine in the movie (and it isn't) the ending would have ruined all efforts.Again, there is the Nothing. In the book it is slowly and silently creeping annihilation. It draws things and peoples into it and swallows them up without any trace. In the film it is the complete opposite.I will say nothing about events and characters that have been omitted as a movie cannot cover everything. However, the loss of Igramul is a severe blow as it forces the writers to invent a different way of rescue - one that stretches belief beyond any breaking point - quite in contrast to what the novel has.The Auryn is turned into a piece of useless jewelry as Atreyu is not kept from sinking into the swamp - as he is in the book.The Southern Oracle, a being of sound in the novel, is turned into two statues speaking in prose, thus bereft of all its mystery and poetry. Of its three gates, only the Mirror Gate is covered satisfactorily. The third gate (indeed hard to depict) is missing, while the character of the first gate is totally wrecked the Sphinxes care nothing about an entry's belief in himself (why this American obsession with self-confidence?), the open and close (seemingly) at random. They do not shoot laser beams but force the intruder to solve riddles thereby condemning him to eventually die there.But not all is bad in this movie. The visualization (except for the Nothing and the Oracle) are good on the technical side. The effects certainly were state of the art back then. Especially the dragon is great. However, sometimes the effects while good in themselves leave a sour taste when they cover the filmmaker's inability to make something of a scene, especially with the Morla. She sneezes about five times or so - and does little else. Her deep melancholic indifference might be mentioned but not actually present - it remains artificial. (And do people that talk to themselves actually realize it so that they can explain it to others) Engywuck and Urgl are doing a great job as the nagging couple. Atreyu looks good too (and I have long since forgiven him for not being green-skinned). Neither the Empress nor Bastian cover all there is to these characters (inwardly and outwardly) in the novel but that is very hard anyway, especially with the childlike, ageless, both young and old Empress.Gmork is also effectively scary as a pursuer (I was having nightmares about him then) but his talking when meeting Atreyu could have been better.

While I don't remember it completely, as a younger kid some of the imagery was almost too terrifying, and almost had me crying (a softy and gullible back then perhaps, but it being all in three-dimensions and not computer animated). One such scene was the sort of quicksand scene in the story, where the main protagonist of the story within the story Atreyu can't help but watch as a girl slips down into her demise. It's a credit to the filmmakers that this and many other scenes work so well, and in retrospect isn't as dated as one might expect. There's also a lot of imagery at work here that is, while for kids, very expressive of the special effects, make-up, production design, costumes, and technical aspects that could serve the story. The premise is one most kids can relate to, about the need of escapism in the sometimes cruel and tired day-to-day life of being a kid. The story within the story, on boy Atreyu in Fantasia must stop the 'nothingness', which will engulf the world unless something- or someone- can stop it. What's interesting first looking back is this challenge of a 'nothingness' being the main antagonist ( maybe Sartre had a hand in the script somewhere), and how it does work by becoming in different permutations (like the wolf towards the end with a heap of exposition). Another thing is how earnest the characters are while still working in their archetypal forms- the boy hero(s), the endangered princess, the many side-characters. It's really a kind of cult treat that kids who were born and raised in the 80's went to with the purity (if not the greatness) of other fantasy counterparts. And if it still works today for kids possibly jaded by animated overload and below sophomoric humor, more power to them and their parents.

Although Barret Oliver did manage to star in the Cocoon movies only because of his cuteness. Director Wolfgang Petersen did go on to redeem himself with Troy, The Perfect Storm, Outbreak and Airforce One to name a few. He hasn't done anything since he failed with Poseidon.

It was pretty good (and interesting to see Deep Roy in what must have been a very early role), but the ending really messes it up a lot.******SPOILER!!!******* Our hero Bastian is pretty much a coward, running away from three school bullies who call him chicken and toss him into a trash bin. We're led to believe that he has learned more about himself and his potential, and become a braver, more confident boy, as a result of his saving Fantasia.Yet after using the power of his imagination to restore Fantasia, Bastian has one last wish for the Luckdragon; help him terrorize the three bullies. How do you like it, CHICKENS! he screams as he rides the back a 50 foot flying beast who chases the boys down an alley and makes them hide in the same trash bin they tossed him into.Seems to me Bastian hasn't grown much at all; if he had he would have faced the bullies on his own, just like Atreyu who faced most of the dangers of his quest alone. (Or, he could have brought a couple of smaller Fantasia denizens to make it an even fight.) The bullies may fear him because he can call on his friend the Luckdragon, but they won't respect him.Maybe I'm over-analyzing, but I just felt that ending was very poorly thought out and messed up an otherwise good film.

Based on a mammoth novel by Michael Ende, and blessed with a budget that at the time was the biggest ever approved for a non-American, non-Russian film, the pic has a good deal of invention and imagination on show. While the plethora of characters and adventures has been dramatically cut down from the book in order to keep the film's length sensible, there's still enough going on to create a fairly compelling story.A young bullied school-kid named Bastian (Barret Oliver) is pursued by a gang whilst heading for school, so he takes refuge in a dusty antiquarian bookshop. Here he comes into possession of a magical old book called The Neverending Story. By the time he gets to school he is running pretty late for his lessons, so rather than facing the wrath of his teacher Bastian hides in a cluttered storage attic and begins to read his new story. The story is all about a fantasy world named Fantasia, ruled by a gravely ill empress (Tami Stronach), which is being rapidly swallowed-up by a devastating force known - ominously - as The Nothing. The empress sends a brave young adventurer, Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), to find a way to save the kingdom from The Nothing. But the more Bastian reads the book, following Atreyu through a series of remarkable adventures, the more he realises that the story may not be quite the work of fiction he presumed it to be. Indeed, he seems to be drawn closer to an alternative dimension in which the events of the book actually become real-life events.The story is very appealing for anyone who has ever envisaged themselves being IN one of their favourite books. If you've ever fantasised that you're Jim Hawkins in Treasure Island, or Frodo in The Lord Of The Rings, or Charlie in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, this film will probably strike a chord with your imagination. The young actors do reasonably well with their big roles (they are expected to carry the film, much more so than the adult actors, and they do so quite competently). The special effects are more than passable for a 1984 movie, with some interesting visual trickery and an amusing gallery of monsters and creatures, both friendly and hostile. As a fan of the book, I hoped for rather more of the story to make it into the film version but it basically only concerns itself with the first third of the novel - which is disappointing but understandable. However, for those who enjoy stories set in fantastical realms with outlandish characters and plenty of mythical adventures, The Neverending Story is definitely a pleasant time-filler.

From my perspective, this movie should have been 3-4 hours long, which should be enough to cover the entire book. Not to mention it would have possibly given the film more of the substance and imagination of the novel. And I must side with Michael Ende, the author, on the fact that the producers used a script that lacked the novel's substance and that the film's technical perfection killed some of the imagination I am craving!Now if the movie had just covered the entire book, we wouldn't have to watch those awful sequels. Besides, I rather watch Barret Oliver experience and enact Bastian's adventures in the second half of the book than endure Jonathan Brandis's constant whining in the first sequel.Speaking of Barret Oliver, his role as the shy, awkward, and unheroic Bastian Balthazar Bux is probably the best portrayal of the main character in Michael Ende's book because here is a boy who can communicate the emotions and insecurities and imaginations so well it makes Bastian himself a believable character in a story. Compared to Jonathan Brandis and Jason James Richter, this person can REALLY ACT. Though his performance in D.A.R.Y.L. is his best, the Bastian role is perhaps the role that made him a cult-figure among NES fans and his own.As for the actors, Tami Stronach was simply remarkable as the Childlike Empress a.k.a.

Some see it as a children's movie classic and a fantasy epic, others don't see much in it at all. It was Wolfgang Petersen's next movie after the highly lauded Das Boot, a completely different genre though. He also wrote it with the help of two other guys. The movie is basically split into two parts. The story of the (bullied) boy who reads the book (not a working actor anymore) and the action that takes place in the book. Near the end these two get together.The central character in the book is Atreyu, another boy who looks a bit like a girl and also like the very young Rafael Nadal, still a working actor today. The humans (or human-like creatures) are all pretty fun to watch thanks to good costume and makeup-work. And then there are many fantastic creatures in this story, some truly memorable, some a bit ridiculous. The most memorable may be Fuchur, the dragon, although I may have even liked him even more if he had been silent. The main plot is saving the sick empress and saving the world this way at the same time. The visual inclusion of the empress was actually a highlight and lifted the film a bit. The middle part was less interesting than the beginning. The biggest strength of the film is possibly the music. Limahl's title song has great earworm potential and the score (by Doldinger who did Das Boot as well) is incredibly well-crafted and helps the story on more than one occasion. Visually, it is a good film as well. It's not breathtaking from start to finish, but there are a couple scenes that are truly nice to watch, such as Fuchur's final flight. All these explosions that looked like meteors I was not too big on. And the moon child/new name part did not wow me either. Felt a bit random to be honest. And sometimes the film loses even more realism than it should, also for a fantasy kids movie, for example when Atreyu stabs the wolf-like creature. What I did like, however, was the reference between Bastian watching Atreyu and us watching Bastian. Really interesting parallel. Nicely done!Petersen has not directed a film in almost 10 years and we will see if he ever returns to movie-making. This one here is possibly his best effort and of you are into films like Momo, you will certainly have an enjoyable time watching this. Oh and don't be fooled. The original language here is English, even if the title is German, probably due to Petersen's involvement.

The observation that books, particularly fantasy and escapist literature, are refuges for imaginative and introverted children is a familiar and easy starting point, but deep into its runtime The NeverEnding Story is still restating it with tiresome simplicity. It need not have leaned so heavily on that old saw, because the movie does have a fresh take on the theme, if only it would commit to it almost from the beginning, we are tantalizingly led to believe that the real world and the world of books have the potential to cross over into and influence one another. Given the early introduction of this idea, it is odd that the movie waits until the very final moments to explore its intriguing implications. The long delay means that the bulk of the film unfolds in a willfully generic, fundamentally unimaginative and uninspiring fashion. Consider that the child hero of the movie's real world storyline claims to have read through the 19th and 20th century fantasy and adventure canon Tolkien, Stevenson, Verne, Cooper. Theirs are works of real depth and observational detail and literary sophistication, and it is difficult to believe that a child who has read and enjoyed them could become invested in the derivative world of Fantasia that the movie creates and becomes mired in. The film might have done better to use a known, celebrated public-domain story and characters instead of its own third-rate pastiches. This would have made the idea of crossover much more dramatic the breaking of the fourth wall is necessarily less surprising and subversive when it is done by characters to whom we have only just been introduced and whose limits are not established than if a fictional person with a known set of parameters were employed for the purpose. Perhaps the filmmakers could not resist the urge to create their own characters, but the puppetry that animates creatures like the stone troll and the flying dragon suggests no technological advancement over earlier works like Henson's Dark Crystal (1982), while the landscapes of Fantasia are far less ambitiously conceived than those in Henson's film. Yet the child hero of the fantasy storyline is made to slog through them at length, and the protagonist of the real world storyline is, improbably, absorbed in the journey. The exciting new twist we were promised is relegated to an afterthought.

It's not the freshest story ever told, but makes up for it with an enjoyable cast of oddities such as the Rock Biter and the Luck Dragon, presented in at-the-time very impressive effects work. The Rock Biter in particular is a colourful creation.Indeed, without the effects work this wouldn't be nearly as successful, with an efficient but undeniably bland cast of human characters. Atreyu appears out of nowhere and never really develops, and while Bastian is an adorable performance, it's nothing that hasn't been seen multiple times before. It's slightly disappointing that even in a fantastical world, both the saviour (Atreyu and/or Bastian) and the 'leader' (the Empress) are white humans- it would have been very interesting to have a more prominent, less helper-role for a non-human creature.The film also sports a notable framing device. While the idea of a plot device found in the 'real' world transporting someone into a fantastical one is clichÃ©, the interaction between a single boy and the world notably indirectly, while bordering on silly and certainly cheesy, nevertheless manages to be endearing. Though speaking of cheesy, one will almost certainly cringe at 'Moonchild', and giggle at repeated shouts of 'say my name!' The film is neither a revelation nor an entry into the upper echelons of Fantasy Cinema, but it's enjoyable, with a nice message for kids. It is certainly a film primarily for kids, but can (just about) be enjoyed by all.

So he is a scoop for bullies which makes much more sense than the way he is depicted in the movie and it makes him a much greater opposite to his counterpart AtrÃ©ju. AtrÃ©ju is in the novel not a handsome, soft spoken teenager but a brave and a little fierce kid with green skin. Fuchur (as Falkor is originally called) isn't a mixture of a dragon and a puppy but a pearly Chinese-style dragon. Artax can talk and has a complex personality which makes his loss in the swamp much more sad. The Sphinxe's don't shoot laser bolts in primitive Star Wars'esque action but petrify people by confronting their minds with all the riddles of the world. Cairon is in the novel- just as his model of Greek mythology- a centaur- not a poor people's Klingon. And what a petty that some of the- IMHO- most impressive characters had been left totally off Ygramul the Many and the Storm Giants. Granted, it had been really difficult to realize them technically but they are of great importance for the story and perfect examples for Michael Ende's remarkable imagination.

Personally, I think if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have enjoyed the film that much. Strictly speaking, it could have improved its linkage between everything, rather than these somewhat fragmented single stories. Holistically, the movie isn't as intricate and engaging as the book, and the message isn't got across clearly. Many shortcomings, not so many redeeming features but is a relatively delightful movie to watch albeit. I guess if you haven't read the book, you might like the film a lot.

There are more differences between the book and the movie.In the book, Atreyu is a warrior with a green skin. That's why I firmly believe that James Cameron's and his 'Avatar' was heavily inspired by Michael Ende's book. But that is no longer the issue here ;-)There are more differences, mainly because back in 1984 CGI wasn't possible yet and much couldn't be realised, like the centaurs. But also the horse, Artax, which can speak in the book. Back then, horses were made to 'talk' using peanut butter on the inside of the upper lip of the horse. Just imagine how ridiculous that would have turned out within this movie ;-)The movie has never bored me and it still gets me in renewed ways. The effects are way outdated, the typical '80's synthesizer music sometimes is too much nowadays and there are some more issues these days.But the moral of the story is still as strong as ever. Dispair as a result of losing your imagination in present society and the idea of the possible forces behind it. The magic mirror in which your true self is reflected. In which the brace discover they are cowards and the nerd turns out to be a hero. I love it!The movie is often described as dark and terrifying for kids. That's bullshit. The movie got me when I was only 8 years old. People who think this is terrifying for children, are practicing a nice dose of Freudian projection, like the mother who is afraid of lightning and passes this fear on to her children.For years I've been hearing about a new movie based on the book and I've been looking forward to it just as long.Until then?

For this review, I am going to list off this clown's 9 Reasons and pretty much prove why they hold no water.1. It is so slow. So incredibly slow. - This guy must be a fan of movies with a simplistic plot and multiple explosions. The movie has many layers to it; the surface story, the psychological aspect and the mythical groundwork. Complex movie are usually seen as slow by the slow-witted.2. Many characters' voices do not match their lips, and it is really distracting. - I didn't notice this at all. I'm guessing the buzz-feed review watched a bootlegged version of it online.3. Atreyu screams most of his lines. - Yeah.. when he is flying around on a dragon or doing action stuff maybe. 4. Falkor the Luckdragon is shockingly creepy. - The only thing creepy here is the guy seeing anything but a goofy/sleepy luck- dragon. Seriously.. I'm worried about you, buzz-feed guy.5. It is unrelentingly depressing. - Depressing? Maybe if you don't watch the movie all the way to the end. A hero's journey wouldn't be entertaining if it was all sunshine and lollipops.6. Speaking of The Nothing, it actually looks like a bunch of dark, swirling clouds &#x97; which, technically, is something. - And after the dark, swirling clouds.. there is nothing! Did he expect The Nothing to just quietly erase everything? That would be kind of boring.7. The final confrontation between Atreyu and Gmork is super lame. - Yeah.. this clown MUST be a huge fan of all the Transformer movies. Atreyu and Gmork have like a 5 minute conversation filled with dark overtones and suspense. The physical fight between them was short but grand considering the scope of their roles in the film.8. The climactic revelation is even lamer. - So this guy g00gled the name given to the princess in the book and is pretty much just using this point to show us that he read the WlKl page for the novel. He deserves a slow clap for such effort.9. The title song will be stuck in your head for days and days and days. - It will get stuck in your head for days and days.. unless you listen to the radio or other songs!Reading the buzz-feed article encouraged me to go back and watch this classic gem. I'm sure The Neverending Story will continue to entertain us and future generations for years to come. I hope they never remake it.

Eventually, reader Oliver and adventurer Hathaway join forces.The blueprint for a true classic is all here, but too much of writer Michael Ende's imaginative original work is left out or altered; there is little nuance, the characters' relationships are underdeveloped, and the parallel quest undertaken by the boys loses its grandeur.

Only one brave warrior can stop the force and save the land and the Childlike Empress &#150; but nobody expected that warrior to be the boy Atreyu. Atreyu sets out on his impossible quest with Bastian hooked on his every step but Bastian does not expect to lose as much of his time into the story as he does.I read this book as a child and loved it, rereading it several times afterwards. The film came out after this and I can still remember the excitement of going to see the film with my Mum while we were on holiday &#150; I remember loving it despite it not being as good as the book and the version in my head. Years later (just over twenty actually &#150; where is my life going to?) I decided to watch it again although I was sure it would be a corny kids film with very dated effects. In some aspects I was right but generally I was surprised by how strong a film it was and how great a kid's fantasy it still is. The tale is darker than I remembered &#150; full of loss, depression and hopelessness against great odds; it may all come down to a moral of believing but it is much less corny and clichÃ©d than that idea suggests. At times it is genuinely frightening and I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I was often as engaged as Bastian was. It may all end up in familiar territory but the German roots are clear and it is much better than similar fairy-tales that American studios sanitise and serve up with loads of kid-friendly syrup.The puppets and effects of course look dated but they are still effective because mostly they are imaginative and well done. The cast are impressive considering the reliance on children on the whole. Oliver is a bit close to being cute but just avoids it, while Hathaway manages to lead the action side of the story convincingly. Voice work is mostly very good and compliments the puppets well. Petersen directs the whole thing with an atmosphere that compliments the material &#150; slightly magical but also pretty dark and mean.Overall this is a fine film and a great one for kids to see. Although the clichÃ©s are there they are well delivered in a clever and interesting plot that keeps the corn at bay. Meanwhile the whole product has a dark and magical air to it that draws you in &#150; it isn't perfect and modern kids may struggle with the effects but many will be too won over by the story and the mood to care.

Whenever it would rain at the YMCA and we were stuck inside, they'd whip this out. After having to watch it for the fifth or sixth time one summer, I hated it. I revisted it last year after having not seen it in about 15 years. What an awesome picture. Watching it now from a fresh perspective with very vague memories of it, was like seeing it (mostly) for the first time. And now as adult, I really was affected by the magic they were able to create. Most know that it centers around a boy hold up in a storeroom one rainy morning (one of the great atmospheric things in the film). You can't help but want to watch it nowadays in that same setting in your house. As he reads, we are seeing it all in live-action. The story within also concerns a boy, he in a mystical universe. We follow his adventure in trying to save a doomed land. Watch it yourself for more details, as I don't have several weeks to sit here and get into the greatness of it all. The performances are terrific, as the two young boys have to carry most of it. Hathaway is great as the book's hero, as is Oliver as the enthralled observer on the outside. But maybe the most awesome thing about the film is the absolutely WONDERFUL soundtrack. Doldinger and Moroder totally blew me away with the emotional work, and just the same with the upbeat moments (the music accompanying the flying sequences will always take me away). Plus an extremely memorable title song by Limahl. And for those who bash the film because it is not loyal to the book...WHO CARES??? They still provided us with a terrific story experience that went far beyond the expectations of a childrens movie. I wouldn't care if they just stole the title and changed everything to what we see in the film. What they made was perfect. Unfortunately, some very lackluster sequels followed, but there's no way to re-create this kind of magic.

I had never experienced anything like it before - this was long before I saw films like Willow and Krull - and I can still remember the staggering range of emotions that it generated from nail-biting fear at the poltergeist intangibility of The Nothing; heart-wrenching sadness at the death of Artax (I was literally in tears as the Swamps of Sadness swallowed him; not good form for a rugged little brat) to a strange... something at the sight of the gorgeous Tami Stronach as the Child Like Empress. And, of course, what self-respecting 8-year-old was not spitting with jealousy at Bastian's triumphant ride of Falkor at the film's climax? There really is no denying that this film was a benchmark in its genre; in fact I think I could probably hold it responsible for my up-to-the present love of swords and sorcery in both film and literature.

Of course, my perception of special effects was pretty lousy, and although some of the effects seem somewhat weak, it was pretty damn good for 1984!!Barret Oliver and Noah Hathaway (Bastian Bux and Atreyu) are great little actors and play their parts very well, as did the girl who played The Childlike Emperess (can't remember name!).The characters from Fantasia are imaginative and original - Rockbiter, Falcore - they all rock! And God knows I probably cried when I was little when I watched poor Artax sink in the mud.

To call this movie just a children's film is underestimating it.  It is a fantasy and it is good enough for children, yet it does so much more.  This movie let's it's watcher be a kid or experience the joy of being a kid.The NeverEnding Story is the story of a story (it's not so confusing for someone who's seen it).  This is the contemporary story about young Bastian.  Bastian is an elementary school daydreamer.  His daydreams help him cope with things like math tests, swim-team try-outs, bullies and especially from the loss of his mother.  Bastian is constantly reminded to keep his feet on the ground.  One day, he stumbles on this mysterious book that can surely feed his need to daydream.  The book is called The NeverEnding Story.  Bastian finds out that this particular story is about the majestic and surreal land Fantasia being destroyed by the ultimate of all evils, an evil that has not purpose, no reason, no shape no form and not identity that it can only be reffered to as the nothing.  All citizens turn to the leadership of the Empress during this crisis, but alas she has fallen prey to the nothing as well.  The last hope for Fantasia is the warrior-boy Atreju to find a way to stop the nothing, and so the adventure begins.Just like the way Bastian gets pulled deeper and deeper into this story, so will anyone who watches it.  This movie, based on the novel by Michael Ende , does the impossible by turning basic human emotions into tangible backgrounds and characters, such a the Swamps of Sadness ,The Southern Oracle, Gmorke the Wolf and Falkor the Luck Dragon.  The most memorable of all in this film is the Ivory Tower and The Childlike Empress.  Her presence in this film is all too enchanting.  No one is ever the same again ,after watching this film.  The underlining theme (of the nothing)is something that holds true to anyone of any age and time. Bastians' last act in the end of the film sums-up every kids' wildest dream.   At times it may be hard to root for Atreju when he rants and screams like a whinny ,spoiled brat.  He has his moments though. The rest of the colorful characters like Falkor, Engywook, Rockbyer, and especially The Childlike Empress more then make up for it.                I highly recommend this film for children of any and all ages.  It's a must see.

As a boy I wanted to visit Fantasia and ride the luckdraggon and even meet the Empress (who is still one of the most beautifully filmed characters ever) but I knew it was all a movie and continued with my life.  The biggest mistake ever.The Neverending Story was real.  It kept telling me that I was part of it to, but I never understood that as a child.  It is not about books, but about going beyond books, transcending them, moving away from words and pages into making things real for yourself.  Perhaps that's why I dislike the book so greatly.  It was too specific.  Bastian was made a character too detailed for his own good.  Bastian, in the movie, and appropriately so, is not only every child, but every person.  Anyone can relate to him and his wishes, whereas the book was too character driven and not fascinated enough by its own premise.  And those who scoff at the film's effects, then spend the rest of your life in a laboratory and concern yourself with the physical world and never understand what The Neverending Story was about.

Because of frightening elements... with that said, that's what makes it more adult. This is a movie for big teenagers. This isn't a movie for little brittle ones. Some of the darkness in the movie is actually reminiscent of real-world trauma like the Holocaust of hip-hop in the late 90s.The movie played on several cable networks which gave it longplay as a classic amongst drug users and terminally ill... Hoobastank does the theme song and it's terrible but this is an 80s movie so it only adds to the magic. One of the worst things about the film is the message that it teaches about how to read.

It didn't start off great, the narrative was clumsily pushed along without any sense of setting, and the dramatic Artax scene felt off as we'd only just met the animal, so no time to really work up some kind of emotional connection to him (presuming it's a him).Generally the pacing felt a little artificial, but this was soon forgotten as the film entered its second half, with the memorable scenes piling up, not least the final threeway (oo'er missus!) dialogue, culminating in Bastian's glorious MOOOOOOOOOONCHIIIIIIIIIIIIILD!!!!!!!!!!!.I got the restoration version (Bluray, from Constantine). It genuinely looks fantastic and Atreyu is far less annoying than I remember, in fact he's a hero! Never appreciated his role when I was a kid (probably watched too much Jedi lark, haha).

You can't beat the movie's message either -- a sense of wonder and imagination is essential to navigating life, particularly as we leave childhood behind and take on the responsibilities and doldrums of adulthood.And then of course there's that famous theme song, courtesy of three- time Academy Award winning composer Giorgio Moroder.Grade A- "},{"Title":"Appealing for kids and the kid inside all of us.","Date":"11 November 2014","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":" There's much that is charming about this kind of family oriented, classically styled fantasy. It's not exactly subtle about its message, but it still offers a dazzling amount of entertainment, enhanced by memorable characters and settings. It marked the English language debut for the acclaimed German director Wolfgang Petersen, who'd previously done the WWII drama Das Boot. He works with an appealing group of child actors and an accomplished bunch of adult performers, giving his film great pace and plenty of atmosphere.Young Bastian (Barret Oliver) is a boy who's lost his mother, and is bullied at school. His dad (Gerald McRaney, in a brief cameo) is concerned that he's not rooted in reality, and that he's ignoring responsibilities. Bastian promises to do better, but gets sidetracked when into his life comes a magical, mysterious book, The NeverEnding Story. He escapes into the attic of his school, and the balance of the movie details what happens as he visualizes the actions in the book.It takes place in a land named Fantasia, which is in danger of being destroyed by an all- powerful Nothing. It turns out that the only hope for Fantasia is boy warrior Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), who must take on many challenges in the course of saving the land and the life of its childish princess (Tami Stronach).It's the wonderful animatronic effects and creatures that truly bring this to life the racing snail, the towering Rockbiter, the apathetic turtle-like being Morla, the frightening and hideous wolflike antagonist G'mork, the majestic parade float - er, I mean to say, luckdragon - Falkor, etc. Viewers will likely enjoy themselves spending time with such characters. Sydney Bromley and Patricia Hayes add appreciable comedy relief as the scientist Engywook and his companion Urgl. Veteran actor & voice over artist Alan Oppenheimer pulls double duty by doing a fine job of voicing both G'mork and Falkor.The visuals and special effects are arresting, and the theme is explicitly stated The Nothing represents the apathy that can overtake people once they dispense with the joy of pure imagination.It may be largely nostalgia playing a part in the appreciation of this film, for this now 40 something year old viewer, but he finds that this tale still holds up rather nicely 30 years later.Eight out of 10.

Of course the story is totally different, but I'm talking about the cinematic visuals. This is a little charming movie Acting the ten minutes of the child Empress' acting are worth more than Oliver's entire acting career (and the actress starred in this movie only ); Hathaway is barely fine but overacts; the rest isn't worth mentioning. Nice parade of fantasy creatures in a fantasy world for small and not-so-small viewers alike. The plot is very simple...a 'coming of age' tale masquerading as another 'Alice in wonderland'...but it isn't bad. SFX are very good, although no longer A+ these days; for example some outdoor scenes clearly look like narrow studio sets.

Here, they said, was one of the most gifted action directors of our generation, offering a European children's fantasy unfamiliar to a majority of Americans, a story that relied heavily on puppets, atmosphere, and a suspension of logic, with a EuroPop score and decidedly German 'feel'. Rather than savor the merits of the film, they chose instead to snub it, as second-class Disney or Jim Henson.The critics were wrong, as the enduring popularity of the film has proved!Based on the first half of a novel by Michael Ende, THE NEVERENDING STORY opens on a father and son (Simon and Simon and Major Dad star Gerald McRaney, and Barret Oliver) so numb with grief over the loss of the boy's mother, that their lives have become perfunctory and sterile. The child, Bastian, is the target of bullies, has lost interest in school, and simply can't connect to the world around him. While hiding out in a bookstore, he is introduced to a very mysterious book, The Neverending Story, which he gradually begins to read. Finding it diverting and entertaining, set in a world of trolls, flying dogs, rock creatures, and a young hero, Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) he immediately relates to, Bastian eventually decides set the book aside...when the story's beautiful Empress (stunning child actress Tami Stronach) mentions him by name! Bastian is, naturally, shocked and skeptical to 'find himself' in the text, and refuses to believe she was referring to him...but she makes it clear that she is, and that the whole world's fate depends on him providing her a name.With this novel twist, and a profound sensitivity towards issues of loss, as well as comedy and adventure, THE NEVERENDING STORY is a unique and quite remarkable children's fantasy that can be appreciated at whatever age you view it. In terms of theme, it is closest in spirit to THE PRINCESS BRIDE, without the slapstick and self parody. Wolfgang Petersen has opened the door to a world of wonders American audiences had never experienced before, and it is a world worth treasuring. And if you think Bastian receives an amazing revelation from THE NEVERENDING STORY, wait until the finale, dear viewer, just wait!

It's pretty deep for a child's movie.  I cry when the childlike princess is begging Bastian to call out her name.I think Tami Stronach may have been the most beautiful child to ever be put on the screen (or else Brooke Shields, but Tami could actually act). I can't believe she never was in another movie.  I saw this in the video store and remembered liking it pretty well years ago and thought it would keep my 4 and 6 year old children occupied on a 5 hour drive to visit their great grandmother.  It did. They loved it and my daughter hasn't quit singing the theme song since she saw it. I got home and sat down and watched it again.  The acting of the two boys is a little weak and the special effects are a little too Land of the Lost even for the time it was made.  The whole thing has a cartoonish feel, but I love it.  The idea of the nothing really creeps me out.It's not Wizard of Oz or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or ET, but it's a delight.  As a child I would make it a 9 out of 10.

Nope","Date":"12 October 2009","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":" The eighties was an age of Cinematic Fairy tales, some were orgininal but most were adapted. Here they are in chronological order Dragonslayer, Krull, The Neverending story, Legend, Labyrinth, The Princess Bride, and Willow. As a novel, the Neverending Story is probably a fine fantasy. As a movie from director Wolfgang Peterson, it is nothing more than a cardboard fable, which doesn't even attempt to hide all its clichÃ©s. This is possibly the worst fairy tale on celluloid. Like the Princess Bride, this is a story within a story. It begins in the present day. Since his mother's passing, young Bastian has lost hope in the world, and is subsequently doing poor in school. One day he gets his hands on an old (and very big novel). He hides in the attic of his school and begins to read. The story takes him to the land of Fantasia, a magical world which is being destroyed a terrible force of nothingness. All the inhabitants of this world turn to the empress for help, but she is sick and dying, the last hope is the young warrior Atreyu who must go find a cure. Bastian continues to read, even after the school has closed down and he is forced to use candles, eventually he will find that he too has a place in this story.There are times when The NeverEnding story kind of resembles the Jungle Book, our hero is in fact a kid, and not much of a character at all. He even looks like Mowgeli, a toothpick dressed in rags. The creatures he encounters on the journey, look equally ridiculous and fake. Whatever money Peterson had was clearly not enough to make convincing effects. Even the starry night sky in one scene is so badly painted and dressed that you can see the outlines of the plywood backdrop on which it is painted. On top of all this, The Neverending Story is plain dull. Its intention is to reignite the dying spark of fairy tales, but if anything, The Neverending Story is more liable to have people thinking that there is no hope for the fairy tales. If it is hope you want go for the Princess Bride, leave this on the shelf to collect dust.

The gnomes Engywook and Urgl are just wonderful also. All the characters make up a splendid ensemble. The music is perfect, the sets and locations are so unique (TNES is NOT generic fantasy), and the basic idea of the story is pure genius. The concept of The Neverending Story is so different and outside-the-box, yet universal and timeless and oh so relevant. It is all about the power and scope of one's imagination and how important it can be to just lose yourself in a story in order to fuel that imagination. The theme song also breaks the mold and perfectly captures the essence of the film. I defy the irksome comments made about this film. Falkor does NOT look like a dog, he is a luckdragon. The acting is NOT cheesy, and of COURSE the movie has to end at SOME point (I mean really, don't take 'neverending' so literally). If you've read the original book by Micheal Ende, you may feel that the NES is a bit too short. That's its only fault, really.

The story is kind of simple and brief, not exactly epic, and there are plenty of cheesy moments ... and the less said about the soundtrack of the movie the better.

It's not perfect, but watching it again 25 years later, I gotta say that it stood the test of time and it's a movie that's still relevant today as it was in 1984. Today's definition of fantasy or family movies involves mindless comedies or stunts with an overdose of CGI. If I'm gonna compare it to food, those are junk foods. TNES is one of the main course. It makes you full. You need to digest it to absorb the nutrients. It's not a momentary hunger fix, or sugar-spiker. Its impact is long-lasting. Like a lifetime in fact.

There is considerable imagination evident in the sets, characters and visual design generally. The prosthetic makeup is mostly OK, the blending of oversize and undersize image elements is generally well done, but the travelling mattes (pre-CGI) are fairly shoddy. The music is not bad with the exception of a strident orchestral motif which, whenever it appears, shifts you bodily out of the story. The child actors are fine, but some of the adults are over the top. And the whole thing has a weird feel to it which, I think, comes from its German origin - one feels that Hollywood would have approached this rather differently (not necessarily better). And it looks very dated.But I think it continues to have appeal for a young audience.

This film's legacy is that it is considered to be a classic family movie. That's right, parents. This film that features giant bloodthirsty wolves, manic depressive turtles, statues that shoot lazers out of their eyes and plenty of scenes depicting a world being destroyed by natural disaster is a sheer joy to watch with your kids. It's quite appropriate that Fantasia is a world created from dreams and fantasy because your kids will have plenty to dream about after watching this. And when they're not dreaming about lumpy-headed wise men atop ivory towers, they will no doubt, be contemplating the many life lessons Neverending Story has to offer. Among the most powerful lessons this movie has to teach your young tikes is don't cry when your dog gets killed by a car because it was quick and painless and nowhere near the agonizing trauma that accompanies Artax as he sinks in a swamp. There are also profound lessons about mankind and human nature here. Witness the Magic Mirror Gate where kind men find out that they are a&#x97;holes and brave men find out that they are p*$$ies.

It's easily enjoyable for anyone with a vivid imagination.Bastian (Barret Oliver) is a lonely young boy who is coping with the death of his mother, struggling in school, and has to deal with bullies every day. His only solace is books, particularly fantasy books. While hiding from bullies in a used book store he sees an exciting looking book called The Neverending Story in the hands of the grouchy shopkeeper. Bastian becomes intrigued and steals the book when the shopkeeper is on the phone. He then escapes to his school's attic to read the book, and the film becomes a movie within a movie. The audience is then transported to Fantasia, a lush fantasy land being destroyed by The Nothing, and whose childlike Empress is dying. The Fantasians only hope is a boy warrior named Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), who must find a cure for the Empress' illness and stop the Nothing from destroying their world. Bastian then follows Atreyu on his quest, experiencing and feeling everything Atreyu feels, including the desperate hope they can save Fantasia.I love this movie. It's been one of my favorites for a long time for both the film itself, and the deeper meanings of it. The Neverending Story is also easily enjoyable for children and adults. Though parents be warned, children under seven may be very frightened by the G'mork, an evil wolf-like creature. The acting is good and the atmosphere of Fantasia is always with the audience. I must admit the special effects are pretty bad. But it was only the early 80's, and the film is good enough to ignore that. There was a lot of criticism for this movie on the fact it was not loyal to the book, and even the author himself hated it. Honestly, it IS fairly loyal to about half of the book, but this film ends where maybe Chapter 14 of the 26 chapter book starts. It is definitely the fantasy of every lonely bookworm, and a must for anyone who loves to read. Oh, and don't watch the other two sequels to this, it will just kill everything lovable about the first one.

Like many of those films, this one too is based on a book, by. Many probably don't know the film doesn't cover the entire length of the novel, due to time constraints as well as budget. However, the production team didn't allow this stop the movie from being as adventurous and memorable as it is.Where can one start other than the effects? The advent of CGI has expanded the world of fantasy, but one must always remember the roots. Epic long shots, some even taking advantage of very clever landscape matte shots, help to create the world of Fantasia. The well constructed sets are also a treat, and they fuse to make it all very convincing. Good old practical effects are used for the wide range of creatures, to make-up, animatronics and full-scale models. One can't help but marvel at the work put into it all.The score by Klaus Doldinger, and in the American cut cues being added by Giorgio Moroder, creates an energetic yet also dark tone for the movie. This brings me to the target audience. It is definitely a movie children will enjoy, but if you closely any one of any age can enjoy it. Note my favorite scene, the one where Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) and G'mork, superbly voice-acted by Alan Oppenheimer, have a very eerie exchange of dialogue. Pay attention to what the characters say and you'll get the full grasp of what the film is saying about humanity, most importantly the death of dreams.A classic and one of my personal favorite films.

(In other words, it all too easily could have gone the way of `Labyrinth.')But the film turns out twenty years later to be a pleasant surprise, inspiring hardly any cringes at all.  Director Wolfgang Petersen approaches the material with a surprising seriousness--while the overall tone is definitely light, there are few jokes, and what whimsy there is is decidedly European in style (clowns, maskers, occasional dry wit, etc.).  In fact, the fantasy itself is perhaps uniquely German, reminiscent more than once of Mozart's `ZauberflÃ¶te.'  The unsentimental approach makes the film's overtly emotional moments (the Artax scene, for instance) genuinely affecting. The design is stylish, yet believable, and the puppet artifice of such characters as Falkor, the Rock-biter, Gmork, and Morla only adds to their liveliness.  As for the performances, Barret Oliver is occasionally over-the-top with his wide-eyed take on Bastian, but Noah Hathaway is impressive as the boy warrior Atreyu.  The score (by Petersen's pet composer Klaus Doldinger) and title song (by Kajagoogoo's Limahl) are not going to be to all tastes, but the Europop melodies and synth textures actually work surprisingly well for those with open minds.  It's too bad Michael Ende disapproved of the script; it truncates his novel, certainly, but retains its magic reasonably well.  The basic message--reading keeps your mind healthy, and is fun on top of that--is simple but evergreen, and if the ending is somewhat abrupt, the film is still a fine example of top-notch children's entertainment.  8.5 out of 10.

For this one, the story itself was so lame that I couldn't bother to have a second viewing.Well, let's see how the story goes. A child, who recently just lost her mother, facing difficulties in school, bullied by schoolmates, found a story book, or to be precise, stole a book from a bookshop after hiding there from his bullies. The story book started like a fairy tale / fantasy about the quest of a boyish warrior known as, OK, I forgot his name, since he looked like an Indian (the American one), let's just called him Chief, my favorite Red Indian (from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest).The background was about a fictional world called Fantasia, yea, sound familiar right? So, this world of Fantasia was facing a threat called Nothing, a kind of very destructive storm which supposed to make 2012 (the movie) looked like a breeze. So, all the creatures around this fantasized world of Fantasia (no Mickey Mouse though), ran to the palace of the Empress (whom had no name) plead for help. Now, as the Empress of Fantasia was gravely ill (I am not very sure about that), she send her minister, well, it was just a Sam L Jackson look-alike tried very hard to be Confucius to tell her people that sorry bro, I have no idea what we can do to this 'Nothing' and let's just send a dumb enough warrior who was dumb enough to take the quest.Of course, no warriors in Fantasia was dumb enough, except a kid whom I called him Chief. Chief and his pony travel across Fantasia looking for a cure, to cure the suppose illness of the Empress. Finally, knowing that it he had been running like a headless chicken, the Chief traveled to a swarm (which remind me of Krull), and met a giant tortoise, which has mental problem obviously, called itself we and shown two different personality (Gollum?), and left him a hint, go and look for the Southern Oracle. The Chief, in great grief that he lost his pony earlier and may be realize that he won't achieve anything nearly succumbed to the swarm (which was said to have this magical power of consumed animals with depression issue). Just as he was about to be eaten by a black wolf or bear like creature, a dog head dragon called Falco rescued him.Falco took him to the South, and Chief was healed by a couple of minimen, okay, I am tired of all these. Let's move it on. Chief, riding on the dog / dragon hybrid, slain the big bad wolf, but still cannot help Fantasia consumed by Nothing. In great despair of loss, he flew back to the palace and found the Empress, who wasn't ill at all (seems to me). She again insist the point that a human child must gave her a name, which the Southern Oracle had mentioned earlier. Hey kiddo, only yr parent can gave you a name! Anyway, because the child who was reading the storybook, which was suppose to be never end, refused to do so initially, lack of faith I would said. So the palace, the only building left in Fantasia was hit by heavy meteor shower and was on the brink of total annihilation.Finally, before the last of Fantasia wiped out, the Child yelled a name for the queen and saved Fantasia from destruction. So the Empress reward her by giving her the doghead dragon and he used it to scare off his bullies. And since it was supposed to be neverending, the Child will have many more adventures to tell, which I called it THE SEQUEL.I just don't like the story, that's all. Other than that, it's a fine art. Stunning special effect, for a 90s German film, great presentation of a fantasized world, most of the points were given to all these features.

Super cheesy! BUT, there is a lot of creativity put into this movie. In fact, it is the most creative movie I have ever seen. Most fantasy movies use only Westernized themes and characters, like goblins and knights and fairies and what not. The NeverEnding Story uses a huge variety of creative characters; a rock biter,a racing snail, Atreyu the Indian brave,the Empress, etc. It also takes ideas from Eastern cultures, like Valcor the dragon is friendly and represents good luck. The visualizations used are very creative and original.I also like the message behind both Never Ending Story movies Instead of nothing there should be beauty, instead of emptiness there should be love.The Neverending Story is a must for adolescents and fantasy fans.

Welcome to Fantasia, where everything is magical and nothing is impossible. However, this amazing world is being destroyed by 'the nothing' &#x96; the emptiness created by human beings who live in an industry driven world and no longer live their dreams. The Empress of Fantasia puts the trust of the entire World into one boy's hands and sends him off to fight the nothing and save them all. A favourite of many since 1984, any child that hasn't seen The NeverEnding Story has missed out. The wonderful mixture of stunning landscapes and images and a beautiful soundtrack make for a truly magical viewing experience. With an easy to understand linear narrative and basic dialogue throughout, this is a perfect film for any child to enjoy and take into their dreams. The creatures we meet along Atreyu's quest are what any child would picture when you say the word adventure, however the obstacles and challenges faced along the way are what makes this film so unique and special. Atreyu must look deep down into his soul if he is to defeat the nothing. To get to his goal he must have faith in himself and throw away all falsehoods of what he thinks he might be inside, and face his true self. Petersen isn't subtle about the messages he is trying to convey to children &#x96; be true to yourself, know who you are &#x96; and he achieves communication of these values due to the idolism the children will have for Atreyu, and they will strive to be like him. However, like any film, The NeverEnding Story isn't without flaws. The acting &#x96; particularly by Noah Hathaway who plays Atreyu, certainly could be better - although it's far from disappointing. The visual effects, although impressive for 1984 are far from what our kids of 2011 are used to, and this may be a detracting factor in initially putting this film in the DVD player. Some critics have also argued that the certificate of U is too generous &#x96; in the sense it should be higher. When a film is awarded a U it certifies that the film is appropriate for viewing for young children without their parents. However, throughout the film there are some mildly scary moments &#x96; one in particular towards the end, that somewhat makes you question whether children should be watching it alone on their first viewing. I remember watching this when I was about five, and although the fear adds to the adventure, I'm certainly glad my grandma was there with me! (And I was no chicken, even at five years old.) Fantasia is a culmination of all human's dreams and wishes, and the entire human race is represented by one boy &#x96; Bastian. He's the young version of 'the everyman' &#x96; someone every child can relate to. Through Bastian, every child watching this film can believe in the impossible; that it could happen to them. All in all, this film is everything you'd expect, and more, from a mid 80's family adventure movie. With cheesy, simple lines and mediocre acting, it may well initially get pushed to the back of the shelf of any average 2011 household, but give it a chance and you might be amazed, whatever age you are. There's no real surprises waiting for you in the storyline, apart from one subtle twist towards the end that may need explaining to your kids. A very comfortable and exciting viewing experience overall &#x96; and an ending that might leave you with tears in your eyes as the credits roll.

And it does not disappoint. Bastian is small for his age, desperately unhappy at losing his mother and very doubtful he can do anything useful at all. This is made even harder by the routine bullying by older boys on the way to school. But on this one occasion he manages to evade them by hiding in Mr Koreander's bookstore - and after smuggling the Neverending story book out he hides in the school attic to begin his journey into Fantasia . . . The realisation of the Fantasia world is stunning and beautiful, with Barret Oliver's measured narration a vital part which is often missed. Atreyu's mission is a desperate one from the start - fail and everything is destroyed !On first viewing, watching Atreyu's horse Artex sink into the swamp you think he'll get saved somehow. But he doesn't. There are persistent rumours that a horse really did die during filming so Noah Hathaway's grief may well have been real. It certainly makes for a very powerful scene. There are many other real shocks for the audience - it keeps you guessing right until the end.The highlight of all the creatures has to be the Luck Dragon - Falcor. A triumph of animatronics coupled with Alan Oppenheimer's beautiful narration. All the time, Bastian and the viewer are both slowly realising together that it's more than a story - he's a participant too as are all the audience because Fantasia is created by the dreams and wishes of mankind ! The tension of this slowly builds all the way through the film.The final 10 minutes is so emotional I still have difficulty watching, as the empress explains to Atreyou that Bastian holds the key to their survival. He simply can't believe that one small boy can be that important - and all he has to do is give the empress a new name ! Bastian then wishes Fantasia back into existence from a single grain of sand - and gets to terrify the bullies with the help of Falcor.Gripes ? Noah Hathaway wasn't the best choice for Atreyu, giving a rather workmanlike performance. One wonders what River Phoenix or Patrick Bach (of Jack Holborn fame) would have done with it.

But this was also a really creative period in our history because from this decade came some of the best in Science Fiction, Horror, and Fantasy films. We watched Indiana Jones narrowly escape deadly obstacles, Marty McFly travel back and forth threw time, and a spoiled teenage girl explore a labyrinth to try and save her baby brother. But before the latter, which is one of the most beloved of it's kind, came a film based on a popular German Fantasy novel of the same name that still has a following to this day. And after all these years it has held up really well.Pros Good acting all around. Fabulous score and cool theme song. Great story. Excellent special and visual effects. Beautiful production design. Good steady pace. Nice cinematography. Does a good job of conveying the message that reading is good. Memorable characters. Whimsical.Cons Some dated green screen work.

Forget the awful sequels, this is the one to see and own. The original is a true classic and truly timeless. Like Port wine, gets better with time.Knowing it's a foreign movie (German in this case) only makes it feel even more special and distinguish than it already is. I am not even a fan of many fantasy movies, but this one is fantastic. More than just a movie, it's like a miracle come true and it takes us to a wonderful world of fantasy, a world of make-believe, a land of dreams and magic.Cinematography is spectacular, with dazzling landscapes and settings. Special effects are fascinating. Sounds are awesome. The movie is not purely artistic, there is a story behind the art of this creation. A very interesting and deep story, an emotional quest. This film is epic.For a fantasy tale it is surprisingly short. But hey, why do all fantasy movies have to be more than 2 hours or nearly 3 hours long anyway? During its short length it offers a lot more than most fantasy movies do in a much longer length. Its pace is flawless but fast... or maybe the film is just so good that it ends fast, way too fast, leaving the wish for more.This amazing film is a cinematic masterpiece and one of the finest ever, very worthy of belonging to any good movie collection.The soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger is pure genius. The entire score is instrumental aside Limahl's lovely song Never Ending Story. The rest of the soundtrack appeals to the senses. Some of it sounds so sad and emotional that it causes eyes to get teary. Some of it, such as the Southern Oracle's Theme and the Sphinxes's Theme, sounds and feels so deep, intense and creepy that it sends chills down the spine. Some of it sounds so happy that it puts a smile on your face.Atreyu is my hero. He is nice, cool, very brave and determined, has charisma and his long hair is phenomenal. Bastian is cute, nice, adorable, shy, innocent. The Childlike Empress is so expressive in every way despite her very short role. The luckdragon Falkor is a gentle giant, very friendly and endearing. And he is so cute, looks like a giant plush. Makes me wanna pet him and cuddle him. The gnomes Engywook and Urgl are hilarious. Their eccentric appearance and weird voices alone would be enough to make them comical, but it's whenever they argue with each other that they are really funny. Gmork is a fabulous villain, but very frightening. His terrifying figure combined with his powerful voice makes a scary combination.Noah Hathaway is super as the great little warrior Atreyu. Barret Oliver is amazing as Bastian. Tami Stronach is impeccable as the Childlike Empress. In other words, a perfect cast.This gem exists in two versions the English language version and the German dubbed version. Normally I can't stand dubbed versions but in this case I really like it. Even in German language, it still is perfect. It's the same movie anyway, just with some differences. And in certain scenes it improves even more the perfection of the version in English.As I was saying, there are a few differences between both versions. For example, some different names, some different music and some of the same music but not played in the same sequences, some additional scenes (which means slightly longer takes in certain sequences), completely different opening credits and opening music (in the German version it is entirely black screen, without those pink clouds and the music is instrumental and more intense), completely different music in the final credits (but not the same one as in the opening credits unlike the English version) and the soundtrack is entirely by Klaus Doldinger, without any by Giorgio Moroder. It is 7 minutes longer but it doesn't seem so. In fact, I hardly even notice the extra-length. Both versions are very worth owning! Surprisingly the German language and dubbing do not ruin its charm, even though (admittedly) it doesn't sound as authentic in German because it's the same people but not in their real voices. I don't know who dubbed the voices for the actors, but whoever they are they did a great job, regardless of the missing authenticness.Another surprise is that in some cases the voices are almost identical to the original actors's. For example, the voices of Falkor and Engywook sound almost the same. Kinda makes me wonder if they were dubbed by the same actors, but I don't think they were. Bastian's voice is somewhat similar to Barret Oliver's, only less baby-like. Atreyu's voice sounds clearly more childish (a contrast with Noah Hathaway's mature voice), but that's not a problem to me, it's no less charming for that matter.Even without English subtitles I don't mind. I know the English version so well that I practically know all the lines, plus I know and understand a bit of German (if very little).Title in Portugal 'HistÃ³ria InterminÃ¡vel'.

Bastian is played by Barrett Oliver, whose mother has died recently, is a day dreamer and is being bullied. After a chance meeting with a strange old book store guy he steals a book called ... yep the neverending story and hides in the school attic to read it. We then see the story he is reading. The various strange creatures of a land called Fantasia are all flocking to see the child like empress as parts of the landscape are disappearing into nothing. It turns out the empress is also on her way out so a warrior is enlisted to go on a quest to find a cure for the nothing and the empress and save fantasia. This warrior is Atreyu, skilfully played by child star Noah Hathaway. The movie cleverly skips between Bastian reading the book and Atreyus various adventures in the book. What i loved as a kid was the fantasy element and the strange creatures. As an adult going back to visit this film I found I still loved it for different reasons. First of all the music. Not Giorgio Moroders hideous song but Doldingers themes which are stunning. Its a shame the English version does not have the option of having the original German music with it as it was so much better. In fact the German version is just better full stop with the sombre titles at the beginning, the different Ivory Tower theme and of course the removal of the limhal pop song at the beginning and end. As an adult i understand the story more than I did as a child and its a strong story. Its very well acted and is quite edgy for a children's film, with some scenes of a scary werewolf dog thing and some blood when Atreyu slays it.

The landscapes and surreal settings combined with the sweeping score make it quite an enjoyable experience. The film draws quite a lot from the source material, particularly the fascinating idea of a story within a story, turned upside down by Ende and competently adapted for the movie. Some scenes were quite eerie, such as Gmork's green eyes in the dark, and others very suspenseful, like Atreyu's glance at the mirror. The scene where Arthax sinks in the mud is by the far on of the saddest ever filmed. If it wasn't for his return appearance at the end, the movie would have probably destroyed your childhood.There are a number of flaws, mainly the rushed, though optimistic ending and some deviations from the novel, for example, the exclusion of the REAL Oracle of the South.Still, the spirit of the story remains the same, and it's a competent translation of the first third of the book.

The effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic which should tell you how good it is even by today's standards.

The sequels are done by completely different people, and are nowhere near the standard of this one. The actors look nothing like the originals, and the effects are not up to the standard of ILM's.

A few questions though, anyone who has an answer please update me at highpriestess9@yahooWhy was the second allowed to suck so much, and I recently heard there was a third? That can't be good. Why did Noah Hathaway stop acting, he robbed the world of much needed talent? What is he doing lately and can he be inspired (coerced?) into returning to the art?Okay, here's the review A little boy who's lost his mother finds solace in books. While being picked on by fat kids he hides in a book store and discovers The Neverending Story which sucks him into the world of Fantasia, the world of human imagination which needs to be rescued from The Nothing by a child warrior of the Amer-Indian tribes. Only catch is that the title is misleading; the story does end (sob) and the sequel is AWFUL.If you are a child, or have a child, or ever were a child, this movie is for you. No question about it. If you don't believe me, and the hundreds of others who've reviewed this for you here, go to the video store (ok, maybe it's too old to be there, but check online or the through-the-mail rentals) and WATCH THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!! Personally, I recommend you just buy it, you'll want to own it anyway once you've seen it.If you don't like it, slit your wrists, because your heart is dead and you have no more reason to live. J/K o)Seriously though, this is a wonderful film, and the FX are still pretty believable. Few films from '84 are still believable, so you know that means something.

Bastion reads the Neverending story, but he also lives the story and becomes the hero. He meets an endearing dragon who flies him through the air. He saves the world of Fantasia from dissolution. We all want to be heroes who save the world. We want to have value. In this movie, each of us ordinary persons who are still children at heart become one with Bastion and Atrayu who do save a world - a world with rock eating giants and sleepy bats and gigantic wise turtles. This is a movie for dreamers. Do you dream of flying at night. Of soaring through the air with powers. Well I do. In this movie you will be there with Bastion and his surrogate Atrayu to participate in this adventure. A wonderful movie for romantics who have secret dreams of being selfless altruistic heroes.

It truly is one of the greatest children's stories of all time. This story is about a young boy named Bastian that takes a book from an old bookstore. Though it sounds bad that he would steal the book you soon find out that it was meant to be. He returns to his old school and hides far up in the attic away from everyone. With little food and little light he is scared but the Neverending Ending Story book keeps calling his attention. Not realising what he is about to do, he opens the book and begins not only to read, but to create The Never Ending Story. From that moment on, Bastian's thoughts and dreams become a reality in a far away world called Fantasia.His vivid imagination takes him beyond the limits of the real world only to see his own self in another young boy called Atreyu. The adventure that unfolds will make your imagination run wild with joy, fantasy, happiness, fear, sadness, just to be followed by the hope of his understanding who and what role he plays in The Neverending Story. The movie captured a large amount of the extraordinary world of fantasia (fantastica) in a highly beautiful and creative fashion. Sadly, much of what made the book so amazing and a 'best seller' was cut out. Ende voiced his opinion on the movie saying I was sorely disappointed with the film. You can understand why he was so disappointed, but the magic was still there. To finish&#133; I highly recommend you add this to your DVD collection, as is it will add itself to your heart.D. L.

Even though I know it has its flaws, that doesn't change the fact that this film had such an impact on me, that even after all these years, as I went from being a child to an adult, it still continues to astound me. The moment the opening credits roll, and the song starts playing, I'm fully under its spell.The boy Sebatian, is a character I can relate to, due to the fact that he loves reading books, making it his ultimate escape to deal with the loss of his mother, and the imagination it has given him that has him drawing unicorns on his school books for one thing. Unfortunately he also has to bear with three school bullies who love to throw him in the garbage bin because they think he's a weirdo. One one such morning, while running away from them, he enters a bookshop, where the owner at first tells the boy to go away, but then becomes intrigued when the boy tells him all the books he read. Sebastian notices the book that the owner is reading and asks him about it, where the owner states that the books he reads are safe, and that this book is not for him. So, naturally out of deep curiosity, he steals the book from the shop and takes it with him to school, going upstairs to the attic where he can read the book all to himself, since he's all alone up there. There, he starts reading, and the magic begins......The story takes place in a world called Fantasia, a place filled with beauty, wonder, and light. It's ruled by the Childlike Empress who lives at the Ivory Tower. But now, there is trouble brewing due to a mysterious and dark entity called The Nothing which is swiftly destroying the world of Fantasia, and causing the Empress herself to become fatally ill. So, she summons a warrior named Atreyu, who is issued the quest to find a cure for the empress, and save his world.The journey will not be an easy one for him, its full of danger and despair, but along the way he befriends some people, particularly a dog-like white dragon named Falcor, who helps him a great deal through this. Parents should be forewarned, this film, though released as a family film, is not intended for young viewers, since it truly has moments that will frighten and scare them, particularly the scenes that involve the wolf-like creature called The Gmork. Believe me, even now after all these years, those moments scare the hell out of me!!! Nevertheless, despite those small moments of terror, I love the movie with all my heart, and though it has spawned two sequels and its own animated film, this film, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is definitely the best of them all. The boy Sebastian begins to realize that he himself is becoming a part of the story that he's reading, and that leads to an ending that personifies the true moral of the film.I believe, that we are all part of a Neverending story. We create the setting and world we choose to be a part of and live in it, We choose our paths and encounter the things that happen as a result, the people we come across, and the accomplishments that follow. Never mind that there is no such things as dragons, unicorns, or any other type of mythical creatures in the real world. It doesn't matter who we are, what we are, or where we come from. As long as we never let our imagination die or let our hopes and dreams fade away, we can still have our own great adventures, make new and amazing friends, and achieve things that are both magical and miraculous each and every day......But that's another story.

What else other than THE NEVERENDING STORY? The film's quality may be tainted a bit by ridiculous sequels with terrible plots and acting... however, Wolfgang Peterson's original NEVERENDING STORY remains one of the most brilliant children's epics ever captured on film.THE NEVERENDING STORY manages to take a brilliantly paced adventure saga and tie it in seamlessly with a pro-reading message that miraculously never comes across as preachy. The human hero is Bastian, a young boy coping with his mother's death who uses books as a means of escape. One day, he takes a mysterious book from a local bookstore and reads it in the attic of his elementary school. While he reads, he discovers that he is a part of the story as well... the fictional land of Fantasia is not simply on the pages of this new book... it is a land that needs his determination, commitment, and bravery to finish the story.The brilliance of THE NEVERENDING STORY is that nothing is simplified for a young audience. The drama, the scope, the frightening aspects, and the message are all presented in the setting of a children's story... but with the artistry of an adult-minded filmmaker.THE NEVERENDING STORY manages to be a thrilling adventure despite the fact that there is virtually no action sequences. We never have overtly exciting sequences of thrills. The most exciting moments don't build up b/c of visual flash and spectacle... they build up because Peterson engrosses us in the story and when the stakes get high we feel it.In addition to all this quality story-telling... the visual imagery is still beautiful today. The land of Fantasia looks realistic at times, fantastical at others, and has a constantly changing cast of eccentric characters... and they all blend together perfectly in the visual world Peterson has created for us.Anyone who forgets how great this film is should re-watch it and forget the fact that the studio turned this into a cheap and ridiculous franchise. THE NEVERENDING STORY is a classic film for kids that gets across it's message about reading in an thrillingly paced adventure that never seems preachy. That's a quality too few message films have, and THE NEVERENDING STORY's success at doing so makes it a true classic for children and adults of all ages.... A- ...

Many other cherished the book and have disappointed reactions to the the film's adaptation. I have neither. I had never heard of this film in it's theatrical release and never heard of the book.

Although the music is sometimes creepy and gives me goosebumps, I simply love this film!Every time I watch the movie, I dive into a different world. When I was a kid, I used to squeal with joy every time Falcor showed up. And Ingywuck and Urgl (German) were the funniest things I had ever seen. I was particularly fascinated by AtrÃ©yu, who I always wanted to be like as a child. I would sit on my toy-horse and play AtrÃ©yu. I almost cried when Artax drowned in the Swamps of Sadness.But one character of the movie has become part of my worst nightmares. What I really don't like about the movie is Gmork. He is so big and ugly! Probably the ugliest monster ever to be in cinemas! When I was a child and watched TNES for the first time, I ran away when Gmork appeared on the screen. I ran up to my room and covered myself with my b l a n k y until my sister came up to me and said that the big bad ugly wolf was gone. Also today, aged 17, I refuse to look at Gmork. Every time these scenes come, I would turn the volume of my telly down and cover my eyes with my hands. Once, when I was 14 (I had watched it for the first time in 10 years), I even ran away when Gmork appeared! My mother was laughing her butt off while I almost wet my pants because of that wretched thing! -.- Can't even stay in a dark room alone, I just panic.

There is only one person that those who preside over Fantasia feels can do something to stop The Nothing and his name is Atreyu.Atreyu being nothing more than a boy, who is asked to leave all his weapons behind and face this quest alone with the company of Artex, his horse, is burdened with the fact that he has to find a way to stop that which no one in all of Fantasia can stop...The Nothing. A clue to this is that he is a boy...remember that while watching the film! The boy that is actually reading the book becomes part of the story, unbeknownst to him at the time he gets the book. Overall...the only thing that keeps Fantasia alive is the fact that Bastian sets aside what he knows as reality and has enough hope to believe that his dreams are real and that nothing is impossible...so long as you have that hope that is so often and tragically lost as we grow older and have to keep our feet on the ground.The real breaking point for me is when Atreyu confronts Gmork, a demon-like wolf who happens to be assisting The Nothing in consuming all of Fantasia. Gmork describes exactly what The Nothing is...and he explains it thoroughly to Atreyu. If you listen to the dialogue between Atreyu and Gmork and relate it to your adult life then you will hopefully understand what is being relayed during this scene.The most significant part of the film is when Atreyu finally talks to The Childlike Empress within her Ivory Tower after all the rest of Fantasia has been consumed by The Nothing. This is when Bastian finally realizes that he IS Atreyu...in the sense that he was reading and experiencing all of the adventures, trials and hardships of Atreyu just as Atreyu was in the world of Fantasia. This part of the film always makes me cry even to this day even though I am almost 26 years old.When you get wrapped up in a movie or a book and get so totally lost in it then you are taken to another world...a world far, FAR away from here and that is the PRECISE premise behind The NeverEnding Story. The Story is indeed NeverEnding because you ARE the character, the Atreyu, and so long as you still have dreams and hopes and are willing to reach for them and believe in things which people tell you are not tangible and achievable then The Nothing can and will never consume Fantasia!!! Mothers and fathers...I recommend this highly to you and your children. It helped me a great deal and hopefully it will help your children as well.

The settings, the characters, the plot, everything was brilliant. I know I use the word 'imaginative' a lot in my reviews, but this movie is the most imaginative movie of all time, (I really should read the novel it was based on.) The characters were genius. The rock biter was completely original. I can't think of any dragon in any other movie, novel, or fairy tale like Falkor, the luck dragon. He is wise, courageous, noble, and heroic. The little scientist and his wife were amusing, and not in a corny pop-culture sort of way like so many characters in part 3. The statues who shot beams from their eyes and the oracle sent chills down my spine as a child. Finally, the empress, was genuine and wise. Our hero, Atrayu (May have misspelled), was certainly a brave boy. Its a fantasy, so of course it doesn't have to be realistic.The moral of this story should evoke much thought on the part of fantasy fans like myself. If you remember, the wolf, who was sent to kill Atrayu, explained he was a servant. He also said that he wanted the 'nothing' to win because those without imaginations or hopes are easy to control. I have often speculated that he could be the result of the fantasies of corrupt big business leaders who are fed up with insubordination on the part of their workers, and blame imagination and fantasy for the workers' unwillingness to just accept whatever their employers try to do to them. Maybe I am reading too much into it though. I tend to do that.I give the movie a 10.

I was 15 at the time ,back in 85 and I was totaly carried away by it. It was the first and the last time, that I went back to see a movie again right after the first session ended, and I would have watched it a third time in a row if I had more money that day.This movie was one the biggest influences in my life. It was because of it that I got into drawing , because I wanted to create worlds as beautiful as Fantasia. That first image of the Ivory Tower still is, my main source of inspiration. Never before I had seen an image in any movie that was so close to my own imagination style.I had read the book about three times, before I went to see the movie and it was my favorite book at that time and the first fantasy novel I read, so I was a bit disapointed when I found out that the movie only covered the first half of the book. I wanted to see more !Even today when I watch it, I want to see more, and I hate when it ends.This movie, even with his flaws is my favorite fantasy movie ever, because never a fantasy world was so better depicted in film,  with the exception of  LEGEND  , but the Neverending Story showed us much more of its geographic areas, making FANTASIA a much believable world.The fact that they altered some of the events in the book, didnÂ´t bother me much, although I can see why the writer MICHAEL END, didnÂ´t like it at all, because it really is true that compared to the book some parts in the movie are very disappointing. The Southern Oracle, The giants who create the winds ,( that donÂ´t appear at all ) or the final scenes in the Ivory Tower are a good example of that. ItÂ´s very dificult to understand why didnÂ´t they leave it as it was in the book. Maybe they had no budget for it.But if there is one thing that compensates this, is the amazing atmosphere that this movie has. The production design has to be the more creative and imaginative ever, with amazing creatures and locations that couldnÂ´t better capture the atmosphere of the book. Because of this and despite the changes in the story, this movie really is THE NEVERENDING STORY. A perfect work of imagination.The soundtrack also couldnÂ´t have been beter and creates a fabulous enchanted atmosphere throughout the film.The only bad thing in this movie is the kid who plays ATREIU. Physically it might be perfect, but sometimes it almost hurts to see him act. Others heÂ´s just fine. ItÂ´s a bit strange to watch. Maybe it wasnÂ´t his fault. Anyway, I still think that they should have used the Barret Oliver who plays BASTIAN, because he really can act. Im sure he would be great if he played both parts.So, if you like fantasy novels, first go read the book, because itÂ´s a true masterpiece of imagination, only compared with the work of TOLKIEN, but completely diferent in style and very original. This is one book wich is perfect for all ages. Believe me. Then go and see this movie, because even if if it isnÂ´t a perfect adaptation of the story, itÂ´s perfect in capturing the atmosphere of the novel. The initial scenes in the woods of Fantasia are amazing. And donÂ´t be afraid of watching this, thinking this is a kid's movie, because, if you like fantasy, youÂ´ll never get bored. Kids here are treated like persons not like stupid clichÃ©s that are usual in movies.This is an excellent movie on itself, if you forget about the book. Excellent stuff. And probably the best commercial european movie EVER.NEVERENDING STORY I, is a magnificent fantasy movie. Forget the sequels.

I'm a sucker for puppets and animatronics, so this movie is like Disneyland for me. The production value is huge, and the creations are extremely well done for the time that this film was made. I mean, some of the props/creations and makeup surpass any CGI that the industry can provide today.The sets are what I want to see out of fantasy-based movies today. If they could just take a step back and take the time to bring quality back to the fantasy genre, I would be a happy camper (noteable a happy customer to the production). It's not that I don't go out to see the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potters of today, It's the fact that I don't take it to the level of buying merchandise (or even getting tattoos, if the obsession becomes that big). It's hard for me to become a super-fan of any of the newer movies/franchises of today. It's difficult for me to respect something that was created with a narrow vision with minimal technical challenges. I'd love to see the effects envelope pushed again. (We'll see what happens with Tron) Anyways, back to the review The music is simply amazing.Klaus Doldinger and Giorgio Moroder, both pioneers in electronic soundtracking, they have yet to outdo such an amazing accomplishment. I understand that the soundtrack was way different for the non-US release of this film. I've heard both soundtracks - and I can say completely bias-free that the electronic compositions exceed the rest.Fantasia, Bastian's Happy Flight, The Swamps of Sadness, etc. All great songs. I'm not too sure about the intro song by the Kajagoogoo dude. It's definitely a nostalgic song for me to hear, but I think the song clashes with the rest of the soundtrack. Maybe an instrumental version would've been better? There's a large amount of dramatic sequences that really separate this Kids movie from some of the other attempts on Fantasy. Notable scenes Atreyu's horse and only companion Artax sinking in the swamp, Rockbiter explaining his whole life being destroyed by The Nothingness, The interaction between Atreyu and Gmork the wolf , The Southern Oracles crumbling, etc.It doesn't help that Falcor looks exactly like my dog Buddy from when I was a child. Maybe nostalgia has tainted my opinion of this movie. As many times I've enjoyed this film, I would like to have the chance to hear a review from somebody who sees it for the first time TODAY. I wonder what their reaction would be? Anyways, The story is fantastic. The special effects and props are amazing, the music is top notch soundtracking, and the artwork/general style is unique even to this day.Please watch this movie if you haven't.

However, this is one of the few adapted films I have seen multiple times before reading its basis where I actually want to read the novel now. I have heard that this movie ironically ends at the half point of the book. I just think anyone who can make such an epic feature on a small budget compared to today's films must have had a great book with intriguing characters to base this film upon.This movie could have been seen as controversial at its time, but it wasn't as far as I know. Yes, the movie promotes reading, but it also has a kid who plays hooky in order to read this book. The images in this movie were also scary at times, even to this 25-year-old viewer. The antagonist wolf was definitely scarier than I anticipated, and the final scenes when the Childlike Empress looks into the camera with tears in her eyes was a bit haunting. However, these scenes and characters were effective, and I don't remember being particularly disturbed when I saw this film recently, nor as a child. If anything, I kept watching this film again and again.The most appealing thing about this movie is its originality. The characters were very original, and the evil force many of them are attempting to avoid (Nothingness) was an impressively unique concept. There was definitely a creative pique when it came to children's movies in the early '80's, and this film was certainly no exception.I recently found this movie at a video store on sale as a double feature along with its sequel, The NeverEnding Story II The Next Chapter. The sequel was not as good as the original, but the DVD still remains a prized section of my DVD library. I highly recommend this film! Nearly twenty-five years after it was created, it still stands up to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series recently put on film.Given this Hollywood trend, there is the possibility that somewhere down the line, someone will decide this movie should be remade. Who knows what the result will be? Still, you can't deny the power of this classic movie. Ten stars! I highly recommend this film!

It is a children's movie, with some extremely dark undertones. It deals with such complex concepts such as existentialism and the death of the imagination. Apart from its fantastic elements, it has a very powerful message that without our fantasies and dreams, we will no longer be quite alive, no longer quite human.The plot is an interesting story within a story. It is about a lonely little boy whose only joy in life is books. He stumbles across what he thinks must be the perfect book one that never ends. How can this be possible? We will find out by the end of the film. He starts to read it, and we see the tale unfold before his eyes. The story of the book concerns a fantasy world that is being destroyed by an insidious Nothing. The ruler of this great world, a childlike empress, is dying. A young warrior is sent on a mission to find a cure for her illness. The thing that sets this fable apart from other children's fantasy stories is this it is not a simplistic tale of good versus evil. Although there are some antagonistic characters, there are no villains. In the end we find that the enemy faced by the characters in the film is an enemy that effects all of us. It has far greater implications.Probably a great deal of my love for this film is for sentimental reasons. It was one of the first movies I ever saw on a big screen, and I loved it then as much as I love it now. The special effects certainly look cheesy these days, but the actual puppets and the cinematography are still beautiful. The child actors are very well cast. Wolfgang Peterson is an excellent director. The wide, sweeping landscapes are breathtaking.So, if you have an active imagination, and you are in the mood to take a trip to Fantasia, go out and rent this film. You won't be disappointed.

Therefore, child-like fantasies like this one &#150; and which, conveniently, were all the rage at the time &#150; basically proved the order of the day as I was growing up and, consequently, I still have a fondness for the genre and its 1980s entries in particular. In fact, I have enjoyed this one again so much that I might well decide to spend the Saturday nights of 2009 in the same nostalgic mood by revisiting contemporary movies from my childhood! Anyway, this West German/Hollywood co-production was quite popular in its day in the shorter international version (running for 94 minutes rather than the full 102 of the German cut) that produced a hit title song (composed by Giorgio Moroder) and two lesser sequels (which I don't think I've seen). The striking visuals (courtesy of cinematographer Jost Vacano), production design (Rolf Zehetbauer), make-up and special effects all deftly combine to vividly recreate the mythical land of Fantasia that is described in the titular book being read by put-upon student Barret Oliver who takes refuge in the school attic from the persecution of three bullying classmates.Although there have been many similar movies before or since, this more than holds its own thanks to well-rounded characters (the modern-day boy Bastian himself, warrior boy Atreyu, the lethargic giant turtle, the benign dragon Falkor, the gnomic astronomer Engywook, the villainous yet philosophical G'mork) and consistent inventiveness (the Swamp of Sadness, etc). Apparently, the source novel is much more elaborate (the film ends halfway through the book, Atreyu had a greenish skin, etc.) but, given my averse reaction to Peter Jackson's hopelessly overwhelming THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy of films, I'm grateful for the film-makers' decision here to tone it down where the introduction of characters and the preponderance of interminable action set-pieces are concerned.Wolfgang Petersen moved to Hollywood permanently after this one but, apart from a couple of interesting projects (ENEMY MINE 1985, TROY 2004; which happens to be the only official Maltese co-production in existence!) and good action flicks (IN THE LINE OF FIRE 1993, AIR FORCE ONE 1997), his career completely lost the momentum it had initially obtained with the art-house circuit hit, DAS BOOT (1981), which had even landed him an Oscar nomination. By the way, the executive producer of this one &#150; ex-movie star Mark Damon &#150; had spoken of his second career behind-the-camera while at the 2004 Venice Film Festival which my twin brother and I attended and where he had introduced one of his own favorite films as an actor, Vittorio Cottafavi's superb picaresque epic THE HUNDRED HORSEMEN (1964).

I wouldn't be surprised to see it on TV sometime this Christmas. For the most part its an engaging, involving and occasionally thrilling piece of entertainment. It's marred by a sometimes flawed execution, but it still beats most children's entertainment today by a mile. Because its that rare thing. A kids film with intelligence.Any film that celebrates the joy of reading gets a strong thumbs up from me. And one thing that's wonderful about TNS is the way it taps into a child's psyche. When you were at the age when you believed a story could take on a life of its own. And TNS takes this conceit to quite extraordinary heights.In a story that shifts between the world of the real and the world of the printed page, 11 year old Bastian (Barret Oliver) is still in mourning over his mother's death. Lost in a world of books, his grades are slipping, he gets picked on by bullies and berated by his father for hiding in a fantasy world.While browsing through a bookshop, he comes across The NeverEnding Story, a book about the mystical land of Fantasia. The land is slowly being swallowed up by The Nothing, a black void consuming everything. The only one with the power to combat it is The Childlike Empress, but The Nothing has made her deathly ill, so the Kingdom looks upon boy-warrior Atreyu for help. He sets off on a perilous journey to find a cure for the Empress, and along the way gets help from fantastical creatures, Oracles, scientists and even Bastian himself!The NeverEnding Story is a really quite wonderful film. The story is a fairly simple quest scenario, nothing we haven't seen in a dozen other fantasy films. But where it shines is in the delightful animatronic effects that bring to life the creatures of Fantasia.TNS has puppetry that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Jim Henson film. And there is no higher compliment than to be compared to the genius that was Jim Henson. Some of the puppetry is very obviously just puppetry. But some of the creations you see in Fantasia are astonishing in they're detail and realism.The giant size Rock Biter is absolutely stupendous. It almost resembles a living creature of rock. Perhaps they used optical effects to make it enormous, but its still quite a tour de force of animatronic wizardry. I had no problem believing it to be a living creature instead of an artificial construction. And although I didn't know who voiced it, it provides the Rock Biter with a warm, genial personality that shines through effortlessly.I also liked Morla, a gigantic turtle whose shell is an entire mountain. The facial expressions he pulls are unnerving in they're realism. Complete with dilating pupils, flaring nostrils and bulging cheekbones, I never doubted for a second that Morla was as real as his human co-stars.Of course the one creature everybody ends up talking about after watching TNS is Falkor, the Luck-Dragon. He almost looks like one of those dragons you see at Chinese festivals. But he's a good character. Alan Oppenheimer really imbues him with an engaging, friendly personality. And although the backgrounds are obvious matte work, the scenes of Atreyu riding Falkor across the sky are exhilarating.The NeverEnding Story also tackles some surprisingly heady material for a kids film. Not that that's a criticism. It means its a film with the utmost respect for its target audience. There's a whole layer of meta-fiction that surrounds the film. The more Bastian reads the book, the more involved in it he becomes (literally!).Bastian becomes an (initially) unwilling participant in the story, not just an observer. And there are even occasions when the story within the story involves us too. The Empress's comments about the people with Bastian throughout his adventure certainly seems to support that theory. There are times when TNS seems on the brink of breaking down all the barriers and emerging as something truly remarkable (even operatic too!).But although the film has many good points to recommend it, there are flaws it never quite surmounts. For one thing, I felt Barret Oliver should have played the role of Atreyu as well. Since most children envision themselves as the heroes of the books they read, I was a little surprised Oliver couldn't have pulled double-duty, especially with the film's themes of fiction and non-fiction converging.Also Noah Hathaway who plays Atreyu is a little on the precocious side. He has an admirably feisty, hard-headed quality, but there's a blandness to his acting that doesn't always serve to make him an appealing hero. Barret Oliver is a much more skilled child actor, and probably could have made Atreyu an even better character.The story is also on the slim side. The narrative sometimes seems like just an excuse for the FX technicians to show off. And while there are many grand things like the Ivory Tower and Oracles that look like resplendent statues, the thinness of the story does sometimes show through. Also I could have done without the jarringly anachronistic disco soundtrack.The ending is slightly unsatisfying too. The Nothing opens itself up to many fascinating deconstructions, like Bastian's own boyhood giving away to adulthood, thereby causing the destruction of Fantasia within his own imagination. I was a bit disappointed by it simply being Bastian's grief over his own mother upsetting the narrative. And I hated Falkor helping Bastian take revenge on the bullies who picked on him. Seeing Falkor in our world completely shatters the film's own plot logic.Still, The NeverEnding Story is superb at nearly all of the right moments. A great English language debut from Wolfgang Petersen. He's so adept at fantasy you wish he would revisit the genre more often.

However, as a stand-alone piece of work, this film is totally inspiring and I believe quite groundbreaking from a technical standpoint. A masterpiece of visual FX, puppetry, cinematography, acting and score. I still watch the film quite often whenever I want, appropriately enough, to escape. I'm anxiously awaiting a modern Golden Compass/Lord of the Rings level remake. This story is compelling enough to warrant a big-budget, epic picture.

The Never-ending story is a charming, and heart warming children's film accessible to people of all ages. It is the ideal in the standards of 1980s fantasy films with very surreal settings and strange yet lovable creatures.A boy reads a mysterious storybook to find everything he's reading is happening in a strange yet wonderful other world. The story teaches about friendship, love, compassion, the value of imagination and belief and of growing up. The Never-Ending story is such a part of my childhood and has such a powerful hold over my imagination that I still get choked up when I hear the original title track theme song from the film.I find it tragic that there are many children today who have not yet seen this enchanting classic film. The Never-ending story is based on the novel by Michael Ende and has inspired many film sequels as well as a remake (definitely not as good as the original) and an animated series that aired on HBO in the nineteen nineties.I think everyone should see this beautiful and fantastic film at least once.

Until now.I saw the movie on DVD and it was just magnificent! I never knew this movie would be as great as I had expected, but it was! I loved how the reader actually was the one warrior to save Fantasia and I loved how his imagination came to life! It was so wonderful to watch! It was so beautiful. Everything in this movie can bring a child's imagination to life. The world of Fantasia, Falkor, the empress, the Rock Eater, and so on.Bastian seems like a great reader having read over one hundred books. Also, I love how the empress screamed, Bastian! and Bastian was reading the book confused, then he finally shouted a name. It was just so exciting! I recommend this movie for everyone, except there are some things that I do not recommend for children. Or maybe actually just two. When Atreyu stabbed the wolf and he was bleeding, also when Atreyu entered the gate and the statues were showing their breasts. So that is some mild nudity and violence right there but everything else is great!

That's why this film is so important, cause it established an inflection point in the fantasy genre. It has many beautiful messages and it is a must see for every child.

I remember to this day being completely over-awed by the sheer beauty of the film. From the gray and dull scenes of reality in comparison to the magic and splendor of the fantasy sequences, the first time we see The Ivory Tower is particularly breathtaking. A young boy, bullied at school and still coming to terms with the death of his mother finds a book called The Neverending Story, and upon reading it finds himself drawn into the story and penultimately becomes part of the story. As he reads the book in the solitude of the school attic, it reveals that the world of Fantasia, the place where dreams and stories exist is disappearing due to an unforeseen force known as The Nothing, a collective term for mankind's trend to lose hope and forget childhood dreams. As a result of this apparition, the keeper of the Ivory Tower, The Childlike Empress is dying. A warrior is summoned to find a cure for the Empress and therefore bring hope to Fantasia. The Neverending Story carries a beautiful message that its important to dream and to let your creative imagination run wild. All three lead actors, at the time of filming were under the age of 12,and are very good in their roles. Noah Hathaway had been previously seen in Battlestar Galactica as Boxey and Barret Oliver would go on to star in D.A.R.Y.L and Coccon. Tami Stronach would make her one and only film appearance in The Neverending Story but would go onto have her own Dance Company based in New York.

Along with Legend, The Princess Bride, The Labrynth, and E.T. This is one of the best in my opinion.Poor Bastian is a picked on kid who is whisked away to the land of Fantasia, the land of human dreams. He encounters Atreyu the Native American type boy hero, the wonderful luck dragon falkor, a fast snail, a rock biter, even a stupid bat. A great fantasy film.I loved the whole movie. It had everything! Atreyu just a boy is sent on a journey to save Fantasia from the nothing. The nothing is disease type plague wiping away all of the wonderful inhabitants. Artex is the horse of Atreyu and I must say the scene when Artex is slowly sinking in the mud is one of the most powerful scenes out of any movie I have seen. I cried like a baby when I was a little girl and even more so now an adult. Falkor! What child did not want a luck dragon? He saves the days in many ways....Now being a girl my favorite scene was always the ending the extraordinary Ivory Tower with the almost unreal Moonchild...The Childlike Empress. I must agree with another comment this character is without a doubt in my mind one of the most beautiful to every grace the screen............sorry Halle Berry.Perhaps I like this movie because it reminds me so fondly of my childhood, but any child would love this movie. I really like it because it is before all that CGI which can look just as fake as some of the puppets use, though this movie is no Clash of the Titans, the special effects are of its time and still quite good.

It's probably one of the best scores ever made for a movie. Hear it, and you're back in Fantasia. Even though, in 1984, the special effects sometimes already looked old-fashioned and Falkor (the dragon like dog) looked to much like a puppet, you will accept every character watching it. As a kid, after seeing it the first time, I wished to see it every day. So when the DVD finally came, and me being 26 years, I expected to watch it in a sort of 'ahhh, how sweet', kind a mood. But no. The movie still touches me in every way it did then. This emphasizes the brilliance of it although the effects are way out of date, the movie still stands strong as an oak, as does the score. You will again fall in love with the child like empress and feel the urge to scream with Sebastian as he chases his bullies. So, wanna be a child again? Watch this movie!

To reward himself, he plays hooky in the attic of his elementary school so he can go on another adventure. What he soon finds however is that he is an integral part of the story, as the links between perceiver and that which is being perceived are quickly sewn together, and like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, he finds himself swimming in the petry dish with the rest of his control group.This film is pure joy.Sure, it has some flaws, which is why I gave it only 9 instead of 10 stars. But what it lacks due to cheesy animatronics and a few clunky blue screen effects, it makes up for in wonderful set designs, costumes, music (a dual score by composers Klaus Doldinger and disco Guru Gorgio Moroder), as well as the passion of the characters and their simple beauty, all brought together to tell a story that is truly magical.Brilliant!

I first watched it when I was about seven, it instantly became one of my favorite films. Of course, now that I've grown up I've found interest in much better movies, but I still consider The NeverEnding Story to be a very strong film, and I prefer it to the vastly overpraised Lord of the Rings or The Princess Bride any day. I can hardly believe it's been over twenty years since it released!Bastian is a young boy who is picked on and misunderstood for having a wild and visual imagination. While hiding from school bullies in a library, he comes across a book called The NeverEnding Story that the bookstore owner warns him about. Bastian ignores the warning and borrows the book. He decides to skip school to read it, so he hides in the attic. Bastian tunes into the story taking place in Fantasia, a fantasy land that is being consumed by a nothing, wiping out anything that it passes. The Childlike Empress, queen of Fantasia, is becoming sick and a warrior named Atreyu is on a quest to find what has caused the nothing and what he can do to stop it.What makes The NeverEnding Story succeed is the likable characters (aside of the villains) that you can always care for and root for. Bastian's character has the imagination and heart of a hero, but in reality he cannot face his fears, whereas Atreyu is the opposite in the story. Kids will enjoy the twists of the book as Fantasia falls apart more and more as time goes on.Wolfgang Petersen's direction is very good for this material where he adds in good humor and dark suspense, even for a children's movie. Oliver plays his part well about the cowardly side of the story, while Hathaway does good playing the character that Bastian would like to become. While I dislike most of his other work, Giorgio Moroder actually does quite well with the musical score. The special effects are obviously dated when compared to films like Terminator 2 or Lord of the Rings, but for an 80's film it is still enjoyable.This film spawned two terrible sequels that almost ruin the original's message about courage and standing up for what you believe. Overall, The NeverEnding Story has been dated in many ways and almost forgotten by now, since most children have started watching films like Toy Story or Finding Nemo now, but this movie is still one that I won't forget from my childhood and it's actually one of the only fantasy films that I actually enjoy. 4 stars out of 5.

The story centers on a boy who reads a book which has a story that is actually occurring within the book itself. The characters within the book face several ordeals and events which seem to affect the boy who reads the book. The story was very surreal and so powerful, and as it was mythical, could be fairly creepy.

Basically Bastian Bux (Barret Oliver) is a lonely little school boy who is a constant victim of bullying, particularly from three older meaner kids, and to escape this he has a big imagination and a love for reading, this does concern his widowed father (Gerald McRaney) a little. One day while running from his bullies Bastian hides in a bookstore, owned by grumpy bookseller Mr. Koreander (Thomas Hill), and asking about one particular book, The NeverEnding Story, he warns him it is not safe, but without him looking he borrows the book, leaving a note to return it. So he starts reading the book, and in his imagination he is transported into the world of Fantasia, a land threatened by a destructive force known only as The Nothing, an unseen darkness that destroys everything in its path, so a Rock Biter (Alan Oppenheimer), messenger Teeny Weeny (Deep Roy) and his racing snail, and Nighthob (Tilo PrÃ¼ckner) with his narcoleptic bat seek help. The only hope for Fantasia everyone knows is the Empress (Tami Stronach) who lives in the Ivory Tower, but servant Cairon (Moses Gunn) tells everyone that she is sick and dying, so they have sent for the Plains People to send a warrior, and they get young Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), and he is given the medallion the AURYN to guide and protect him. While Atreyu starts his quest riding with beloved horse Artax, the Nothing sends its vicious wolf-like beast servant Gmork (also Oppenheimer) to kill the warrior, and the young hero ends up trudging through the Swamps of Sadness, where the poor horse is overcome by the sadness and sinks to his death beneath the swamp. Atreyu continues through the swamp to find the wise giant tortoise-like creature Morla, Bastian is heard by them screaming at her appearance that he can see, Morla does not answer his questions, she only tells him to go to the Southern Oracle, which is over ten thousand miles away. After narrowly escaping Gmork, Atreyu finds himself in the company of luck dragon Falkor, who has taken him most of the ten thousand miles to the home of two gnomes, one being scientist Engywook (Sydney Bromley), who is an expert on the Southern Oracle, including knowing about two gates to be passed before reaching the Oracle itself. After passing the two eyes that know if you believe in yourself and kill you if you have no faith, and a mirror that shows your true self, or in Atreyu's case he sees Bastian, he reaches the Oracle, that tell him that the Empress can only be saved if he can find a human child on the boundary of Fantasia that can give her a new name. Atreyu and Falkor fly to find the boundary, but they are caught in the powerful storm of the Nothing, Atreyu falls and wakes on a shore of an abandoned town, and it is there that he comes face to face with Gmork, who explains the power of the Nothing, and realising he is the warrior he was hunting he attempts to kill him, but the boy stabs him. After being saved by Falkor, the storm has destroyed all of the land, until only fragments of it remain, Atreyu asks the AURYN to guide them to the Ivory Tower if it still stands, they are happy to find it, and inside the young warrior is apologises to the alive and well Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach) that he failed in his quest. She reveals that he has not failed, the human child he seeked has been with him all the time, it is Bastian, and as Bastian realises it is more than a story the Nothing returns to start destroying the Ivory Tower, the Empress please to Bastian to save them and shout her new name, so he goes to the window and shouts Moonchild. After a few seconds of darkness, the Empress appears in front of Bastian in a black void, holding one grain of sand, what remains of Fantasia, she tells them that if he uses it to make wishes Fantasia will be restored, so he wishes for the land back and to ride Falkor, see Atreyu and all other characters revived, and also to fly Falkor into his city and scare his bullies away. The narrator (Oppenheimer again) says that Bastian made many more wishes and had many more adventures, before eventually returning to the real world, but that's another story. Oliver is likable as the child reading the story, and the supporting characters all add something to the tale, especially lovable Falkor the luck dragon and the funny Engywook, but obviously Hathaway as the young warrior is the one that you watch and root for the most. This was the English language debut for Petersen, and it is a great film because it is so simple, it has fantastical lands and imaginative creatures, the action and is exciting enough, the special effects and puppetry used are terrific, and even cheesy things like some of the dialogue and the title song by Limahl work well, it is a great fun family fantasy adventure.

In the ballpark of 450 pages, Wolfgang Petersen did what Steve Kloves wants to do for 'Goblet of Fire' cut it in half.  This also gave him time to spell out in bold what was inferred and understated in the book (Bastian's home life, what binds him to Atreyu.)  Petersen also did that which annoyed so many fans of 'Chamber of Secrets'--he pasted on a Hollywood ending.I can see why fans of the books would be unhappy with all of this.  (For one thing, this means Bastian is little more than a cheerleader for 90% of the film.) But all in all it really was an excellent movie beautiful, well-acted and maintains the spirit of the book if not its complexity. And it is unfair I think to expect, particularly for a children's film, that the characters have all their nuances brought to the screen.  The ending gives a closure that I'm sure most 7-12s will be quite happy to see without feeling nearly so out of place as, for example, Hagrid's welcome home in 'Chamber of Secrets'.People have commented on the 80s effects and how dated they look...I couldn't disagree more.  I personally would prefer the exquisite models and puppets used here (caliber of Jim Henson's Storyteller) to the gaudy CG used in the newest Star Wars installments.  Never distracting from the plot, they give the movie an earthy feeling that allows both the actors and the viewers to believe in the non-human characters and alien settings much more readily...something Chris Columbus and, to and even greater extent, Peter Jackson both seem to have realized.  The soundtrack is *extremely* 80s and heavily synthesized, which was cool then and nostalgic for me now but may be distracting for others.To sum up, if your kids are looking for something to fill the void until Azkaban comes out, go find this DVD.  Just be warned there are scary and traumatic moments-this is back when PG really meant parental guidance. (If your child could handle Aragog and the Basilisk, they can probably handle Atreyu being stalked by and fighting the wolf Gmork or the death of his horse Artax.)This is a good adaptation, if not a literal translation...it made me want to seek out the original book as a child.  If you want to see what the source material looks like when completely *destroyed* by Hollywood check out the 1994 sequel 'The Next Chapter' and then compare it to this work of art.

Was I wrong! I watched it with my 3 year old daughter and both she and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. In fact, it's difficult to have her sit through an entire movie unless she is completely smitten, and this was certainly the case here.Neverending Story is a fantastic and light hearted tale for all ages. It has an interesting and unique fairy tale world, yet there is a force of impending doom that sits very heavily and acutely on the storyline. Somewhat unusually for a movie of this caliber, the heroes are all children, and endearing characters at that.The acting and dialog are very high quality for this type of movie. There are moments of laughter, tears, and high adventure. I really don't have any strong criticisms. Some of the effects were certainly dated, but did not really detract much from the movie. In my opinion, strong dialog and a good story will always make up for any substandard special effects, a lesson today's filmmakers would do well to take to heart.Transport yourself to a different world. Both kids and adults will enjoy this gem.

But when I recently saw it yet another time, there's a lot wrong with it.The biggest problem is that the story doesn't continuously move, it's one coincidental meeting after another. It's very fragmentaric so you don't really feel that you're into the movie.The acting by young Hathaway isn't too convincing either and the effects are so-and-so at best. But these are all problems you can live with when you are young I suppose.A great movie to show your kids, but if you keep fond memories of it from when you were young, leave it where it is as you might feel disappointed afterwards. 6/10.

Not the best movie ever, but a fine film nonetheless.  I was disappointed with the movie when I first saw it, but learned to enjoy it quite a bit.  One thing that surprises me is that it was a foreign film.  I never knew this, though that explains why it is kind of a strange movie.  Not that I am insulting it, it is just it moves differently and looks differently than most movies in the U.S.  The story is about a boy who wanders into a bookstore (I won't go into the details to greatly) and finds a book titled The Neverending Story.  The guy who owns the shop does everything, it seems, in his power to get the kid curious about the book, but then says he can't read it.  So the boy borrows it when the storeowner isn't looking.  He begins reading it and the scenes cut to what he is reading kind of like The Princess Bride.  It seems in this fantasyland some force known simply as the nothing is destroying their world.  A boy is sent to save the world and must traverse many obstacles along the way.  All the while in the real world where the boy is reading this story things get strange, as the book almost seems to be real.  Interesting story, the reason I was disappointed as a kid is that I thought the boy reading the book would be trapped in the fantasy world, but he isn't.  All in all though it is a rather good tale and interesting story as there really is no villain aside from a wolf creature trailing the boy who was sent to stop the nothing.  Sequels were made, but the second one, which is the only one I have seen, is awful.

After at least ten years after having seen it last, I decided to rent it and visit Fantasia once again. I really wish I hadn't. When you're a kid, you're pretty easy to please. I remember the characters and situations of this film being so exciting when I was a kid. Now I found everything kind of lame. The weird creatures, from the Rockbiter to Falcor, seem fakey when I am an adult. I'm not the kind of guy who disdains old movies once I've seen new ones. In fact, I dislike computer animation in movies. I hated Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace. All the computer animated characters have this sheen. You know they are from a computer, so it's hard to like those characters much (at least when they are standing next to characters who do not have that computer animation sheen). But I imagine the special effects in the Neverending Story were a little weak when the film was first released. Look at the neat puppet character effects in the first three Star Wars movies. Heck, look at E.T., who was invented a couple of years before this film was released. Parts of the characters moved which shouldn't have, it seemed to me. The tip of the Rockbiter's head kept waving strangely from side to side.I'm sorry, but this movie disappointed me as an adult. I shouldn't have let my curiosity get the better of me. If I did not love this film so much as a child, I think I'd give it a 5. Instead, for my inner child's benefit, I'm giving it a 7/10.

This ultimately appeals to most children who have a difficult time at school with bullies or parents who do not understand them. The story is filled with all sorts of strange and unusual characters. It is an imaginative story, but it is a low-budget production, and it does go quite slow in a lot of places. It works well as a children's film, but adults will be bored. I quite liked it when I was younger, but I do remember that it was quite slow in places. I did think it was imaginative, so it gets points for that!

It's just one of those common movies when something magical happens. One of those films that you know what is going to happen. Everybody lives a happily ever after because it's all magic and make believe and you're supposed to convince kids to start reading through this. Let me tell you something. My teachers showed us this movie as a child and thought it would convince us to start reading, then gave us reading assignments of big chapter books I didn't understand. You know what age I was? I was only eight.Okay, so there's this kid, right? He enjoys reading. In the beginning they attempt to have a normal start of the movie with him doing his normal routine. Eating peanut butter and jelly that came from the ground and his father going to work. Oh look at this. He's walking to school and gets attacked by bullies and doesn't even fight back. This movie encourages children not to defend themself and to just end up being beaten up by nerds you could have done to them.He sits in the attic you see crying and then opens up a book he stole. Look! Encouraging kids to steal. The old man just laughs at it knowing what's going to happen to the young boy. He is reading this book and in the end, he was supposed to end it. He starts flying on a magical dragon and chases his bullies. Happily ever after with a magical flying potatoe monster. Congratulations!

At least they were not that ambitious, expensive and with the potential of The Never Ending Story. No wonder why Michael Ende's name doesn't appear on the credits. His world has nothing to do with this mechanical, gaudy and utterly tasteless recreation. The film has no pace, the perfomances are inadequate, the structure feeble, the ideas imposed instead of being developed. What a terrible waste of money. Spielberg's films, despite their weaknesses, have a lot more warmth, imagination and cinematic strength. The electronic score by Giorgio Moroder is unsuitable for a classical style fantasy tale and it is just the tip of the iceberg in this horrendous misconception.

The puppets had a propensity to constantly twitch their noses as if they had been snorting cocaine all day. Not for a moment could they convince you that they were anything but puppets. The human characters had a tendency to ham up so much that you could open up a butcher's shop. The wishy-washy plot had to be explained in a long discourse by that beady-eyed black dog which was the token baddy in the film. Shouldn't a good film be able to reveal the story by itself ? Whenever the storyline started to drag the boy, Bastian, has to leap up and down to convince you that it was interesting. I expect a lot of people were convinced by that. I am not sure what age-group this film is being pitched at but its unlikely to be much higher than three.So why did I watch the film ?  Limahl's Neverending Story of course which was played at the start and the end, and the hope that it would entertain my 3 year old daughter (which it didn't).

It is also incredably lucky that a kid who can not act worth beans is reading the book. Honestly Wolfgang Peterson is a great director and for that time period the effects were pretty good if you need proof simply watch willow or chronicles of narnia both of which were made in the same time however the idea that a little kid named Atreyu is the only warrior to save them is rediculous. Who trained him? However had I gotten caught up in the moment that would not have been so bad but the acting only reminded me that I was watching a bunch of kids in front of a camera. Again though I recognize how much goes into making a movie and I have respect for all the work they did so Ill hold Atreyu against Michael Ende and give Wolfgang Peterson the credit of a hard days work.
