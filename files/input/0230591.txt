[{"Title":"A Fine Documentary","Date":"22 May 2004","Score":"44 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary","Review":"  One Day in September is a phenomenal documentary. Its focus is on the hostage situation during the 1972 Munich Olympics when Palestinian terrorists took Israeli athletes prisoner. The film does something which I think any great documentary should when it covers or explores historical events. It frames the entire hostage crisis in a larger context. Yes, the film covers 21 hours of September 5th on which the hostage situation commenced and (one could say) resolved itself. However, in order to understand the reactions of the German government, the Israeli government, the media and the Olympic Games' fans and participants, the film discusses the German desire to create the atmosphere of peace to erase the stigma of the 1936 Olympics, then full of Fascist propaganda. It touches on the ongoing Israel-Arab conflict. It touches on the meaning of the Olympics.One Day in September never strays from its focus, however, which is to document the hostage crisis and what it meant. What makes the film great, aside from its intelligent approach to the subject, is how well the atmosphere of the hostage situation is carried across. By the end of the film you do feel like you've watched the news for a day, glued to the TV screen hoping that the people will make it out alive. Watching it, you are reminded of how ill-prepared states are for terrorist attacks (still rings true even recently) because of the ulterior motives of statesmen. A lot of what happens at the state, political level, happens because it has to look good. The Germans were unprepared for the terrorists because they thought that extreme police security would welcome images of pre-War Olympics in Germany. They wanted to appear a certain way. The same went for how they handled the crisis.The film, like many terrorist crises, ends with a tragedy. What remains with the viewer is not only the deep sadness at how one of the most peaceful world events turns into one of the most hateful, but also how incredibly contemporary those events from over thirty years ago still seem.

I think the DVD version is unique in that even its menu page looks terrifying. By the end of the film, however, I was more angry than scared, because of the amazing level of incompetence German and Olympic officials showed in handling the hostage situation. The media also behaved abominably, broadcasting play-by-play accounts of the police's plans right into the ears of the terrorists. It made me think that the Bush administration might be partially correct in keeping the media in the dark about American military activities in Afghanistan.I don't understand why some people felt the film didn't give the context of the kidnapping. I think Jamal al Gashey, the only kidnapper left alive now, explained quite clearly why he did what he did. But if the film had spent an extra hour discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, would that have made a difference? In my mind, nothing justified the kidnapping of athletes who by their very presence at the Olympics were trying to further world understanding. I can't think of many things that do justify holding innocent hostages for ransom. The director seems to feel that way too. Apparently that makes the movie too biased for some viewers.As for the comment that the movie demonizes the kidnappers, I don't agree. The filmmakers include a German official's statement that, if he had met him in a different situation, he would have liked the terrorist spokesman, Issa. al Gashey tells some very human stories, such as an ironic account of getting into the Olympic village with the help of American athletes out after curfew, and he insists that the plan was never to murder the Israelis. And al Gashey's brief but affecting account of being exiled from his childhood village does a lot more to argue the Palestinian side of the conflict than any brutal hostage-taking scheme. Too bad he never has realized that.Interestingly, filmmaker Kevin MacDonald wrote that in Israel he has been accused of giving too much time to the Palestinians. He also notes that Simon Reeve wrote a companion book to the movie, because there were many aspects of the story we could not include in a 90-minute film. It's a pity the existence of the book isn't publicized more (assuming it's any good).I do wish the film had spent more time discussing the aftermath of the tragedy, and that MacDonald had used his incredible opportunity of interviewing the last remaining terrorist to ask him some more hard-hitting questions, instead of being satisfied with a step-by-step account of what the kidnappers did that day. (However, I just read that it was extremely difficult for MacDonald to get al Gashey to talk at all.I wasn't completely convinced that the Germans colluded with the terrorists in the Lufthansa hijacking, and would have liked to see evidence for that. I would also have liked to learn more about the Black September group. Basically, I think the film should have been longer. If it was kept to its current length for some marketing reason, I think the sponsoring studio should rethink that rule.However, the only choice I really wish the filmmaker had not made was to accompany extremely gruesome shots of bodies with loud psychedelic music. It would have been more respectful to show the images in silence.Watching the film in light of the events of a day in September of 2001, and after, makes me think that the world hasn't come very far since 1972, in terms of solving the Middle East's problems.

The only criticism I have of the film is that the flashy editing sometimes works to trivialize the incidents.It is very illuminating to read the prior comments made about this film.

The main argument against the film is that it takes place in an historical vacuum, that it shows members of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team being taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists, but it does not explain the political reasons why this happened.  This is largely true - although there is brief mention at the beginning of the horrific camp conditions Palestinians suffered in their own homeland appropriated by Israel, it says nothing about this highly contentious appropriation, about the natural urge to struggle against it.This is underscored by a blatantly manipulative structure - while the representative of the hostages is (necessarily) solitary, anonymous, in hiding, talking in shadows (the other surviving terrorists were murdered by Israeli assassination squads; this information is recorded in a coda thatseems like some kind of chilling reward for the audience); the dead men are shown as almost saintly - pictured getting married, with babies, smiling, honest, healthy, sporty, part of a community and tradition - one story talks about the high-minded ideals of one coach who fraternised with his political enemies from Lebanon.Aside from the dubious shamelessness of this manipulation, I don't really have a problem with the film's focus.  Coming from a country where political terrorists have, for thirty years, been slaughtering wholesale largely apolitical citizens in the name of justice, who have used bogus political ideology as a front for gangsterism, I am somewhat out of sympathy with anything that proclaims humanitarian motives and leaves innocent people dead.  Critics complain that ONE DAY ignores the story of the Palestinians, their feelings of repression and injustice - and it is unlikely a film on this subject will have a voiceover from a powerful Hollywood player, and win an Oscar - but to do this would abstract the event, would turn it into a political chess game, and not a ghastly abomination where real people, far too young, with families, are unaccountably murdered.  It is the stuff of paranoid modernist literature - you wake up one morning with all your friends, and by sheer random chance, you're held hostage and killed.So if we agree that the film is fatally biased, we can see that it has many virtues.  ONE DAY has been called a thriller - it was literally so for me because I'd never heard about this atrocity - and the techniques used (the pounding score, the edgy editing, the foregrounding of clocks and deadlines, the withholding of explanatory, hindsight information) all contribute to a sense of almost unbearable tension.  I don't know how this is for people (the majority) who know the story.About half way through, as you begin to realise how things will probably turn out, the film stops being a thriller, and becomes an exercise in dread time contracts, and you hope the film goes on forever so that the intolerable denouement is postponed.  It is unbearable.  But after the film you begin to question the ethics of all this.  One of the themes of the film is the media treatment of the crisis, the reprehensible desire of the Olympic Committee to get it out of the way as quickly as possible - one victim's wife accuses the media of turning the crisis into a 'show'.  But this is precisely what Macdonald does, turning human tragedy into an entertainment by turns kinetic and visceral.Other plusses are the revelations of shocking, farcical German incompetence, desperate to reveal deNazification by having no security whatsoever; the callous, indifferent face-saving here by representatives of the police is the film's true, sickening, achievement.  The brief montages of the sporting events, the whole point of the Olympics, are exhilirating, soundtracked to an uplifting Moog Bach, making you wonder why people can't make better sports movies.ONE DAY has been compared to Errol Morris's documentaries, and you can see, superficially, why - the Phillip Glass score, the distortion of footage and time, the letting authority hang itself.  But Morris, in a film like THE THIN BLUE LINE, is concerned not so much with presenting a truth as destroying the official version, exposing its weaknesses, repressions, lies. His recreated scenes, heightened images, distancing effects, all point to the artificiality of the official 'truth'.  Morris uses documenatary's claim to authenticity and truth, to expose the inauthenticity of 'truth'.  His is a critical cinema.MacDonald, however, IS offering official truth here - there is no real difference between what he says and the ABC news reporter.  This is not a critical film, pandering to firmly entrenched ideologies.  Further, the documentary as a genre is limited.  It can tell us about facts, analyses. It can reveal witness.  There is an astonishing frisson in being able to see these terrorists walking and talking on the big screen, that projection of fantasies, like people, not mythical constructs.  But documentary can never get at people's inner lives, and as this is what real life really is, documentaries seem thin and superficial, a betrayal of life.  And so, finally, ironically, the victims DO become abstract - simply that, victims. We know there is more to people than a handful of photographs and highly partial witness.

American swimmer Mark Spitz was its big star, everybody knew him. It really was the most modern and most hip event ever planned in Europe. The best architects and the best artists and designers of Germany were employed to build an Olympic village that still reflects the openness and optimism of the era. Even the logo, a kind of a spiral made of rays, is unforgettable. (The original movie Rollerball was largely filmed in the Olympic village).One Day in September catches the atmosphere that preceded the terrorist attack perfectly, in that sense it is an accomplished exercise in style. I think there really was a kind of innocence connected with it, people truly believed that sports could be a means to bring enemies closer and that the Olympic area was regarded as something like a sacred ground which everyday worries couldn't penetrate. I assume that explains very much the clumsy reaction of the German authorities when they were faced with the act of &#132;desecration that constituted the callous act of the Palestinian terrorists. (I think the German officials who were ready to be interviewed for this documentary are unduly criticized for what some call indifference. Must have been hard enough for them to reminisce about something terrible for which I believe they feel at least partly responsible).The spirit of the Munich Olympics ended with that tragedy, and the Yom Kippur war the following year with the ensuing oil crisis changed the outlook on the future completely. Somehow I feel we still suffer from the shattered hopes of 1972. And where are the Palestinians now? Terrorism doesn't pay.

Whenever two clips are spliced together, regardless of the content there is some editorializing. A documentary is an editorial. If you want nothing more than unopinionated truth, than the only avenue open to you is uninterrupted security camera footage. You can, and sometimes should, disagree with the opinions offered by the documentary filmmaker as a critical viewer, but one faulting the filmmaker for offering an opinion is like criticizing water for being wet. The line that must be discerned is whether the filmmaker is overly deceptive or insidious in trying to convince you of his or her opinion. This is a line that can be very difficult to draw.Mr. Ruvi Simmons of London does not seem to realize these basic tenets of documentary film-making One Day in September, however, concentrates more on the human interest of the event itself, neglecting background information in order to convey a one-sided and grossly biased perspective on a tragic occurrence. I am a filmmaker, and I know that as such one must choose a theme and a perspective for a feature length documentary. The main problem that this person has with the film is that he is that it neither explores the underlying issues behind the Israeli-Palestinian tensions. This is a 2 hour film, not a 40 hour mini-series. There is no way that the filmmaker could have adequately explored the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and still told the story that he or she intended the story of the hostage crisis at the Games of '72. Mr. Simmons also took offense at the filmmaker for vilifying the terrorists who perpetrated this plot. I do not need to offer a critical retort as any logical person can understand why this statement is foolishness. It sounds as though Mr. Simmons feels as though the terrorists were justified in hurting innocent athletes a continent removed from their conflict. Obviously, this person would dislike this documentary (although he does not mention that the documentarian interviewed one of the terrorists to present his side of their story).If you want to have a solid introduction to the acts of terrorism at the Games of '72, then this is a good work to watch. It is true that the thriller-style is a bit gimmicky, but it does add somewhat to the suspense if you do not know the outcome. If you are intending to see the film, Munich, then this is probably a good primer (I have not yet seen it as it has not been released).

But how can anyone be sympathetic to terrorists? The point has been brought up that both sides of the conflict experience terrorist attacks, so why should a filmmaker focus on one side more than the other; however, I think the fact that this attack took place at the Olympics, an event that represents the unity of the world and its people, is what makes the attack and this documentary so important. Therefore, Kevin MacDonald, in my opinion, has license to be as biased as he wants toward the Israelis, because they were the focus of this terrible event that occurred during a time that people around the world should have been united under the Olympics banner.

Documentary about assassination of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at 1972 Olympic games. Noteworthy for exclusive interview with only surviving terrorist, who is in hiding somewhere in Africa. Composed of interviews with German authorities involved in the episode, TV clips, etc, and narrated by Michael Douglas.    Interestingly, East Germans colluded with the terrorists, showing them around the Olympic village prior to the operation.         Truth stranger than fiction. The ineptitude of the West Germans is astounding. Imagine paunchy German cops, clad in athletic sweats, trying to pass themselves off as Olympic athletes, their automatic weapons in plain sight, positioning themselves to launch a surprise attack on the apartment in which the hostages are being held while their every move is being televised worldwide; it's only at the very last minute, when they realize the terrorists too are watching them on TV, that they call the raid off. This is the only attempt they make to storm the apartment building.       Even after an Israeli's bullet-ridden naked body has been tossed out a window down to the sidewalk below, the games continue; the International Olympic Committee refuses to stop them; athletes are sunning themselves within sight of the hostage standoff; and, of course, the media has descended like a horde of flies ready to feast on a carcass. Israeli intelligence, the Mossad, offers to send a trained anti-terrorist unit, but the Germans, who have no such attack force of their own, who are in disarray, disorganized, and frankly at a loss as to what to do, refuse.      The terrorists are taken to a nearby airport in helicopters to a waiting jet. German cops, who are stationed in the jet and disguised as a flight crewm at the very last second, just as the helicopters are about to land, chicken out and abandon their posts. The head of Mossad, who by now has joined the Germans at the airport, is incredulous at the lack of professionalism of the whole ambush; also, he accuses the Germans of taking the hostages out of the Olympic village just so the games can continue. Sharp shooters positioned at the airport are not in radio communication with the outside or among themselves, have no idea of how many terrorists there are, and end up shooting each other and killing one of the helicopter pilots who has broken free.        The coup de grace, the vilest insult to injury, comes in the aftermath of this debacle  Three Palestinian terrorists survive the gun battle at the airport and are taken into custody. Within days a nearly empty German airliner bound from Beirut to Frankfurt is hijacked by Arab terrorists who demand and obtain the release of the 3 terrorists in custody. One of these 3 later recounts how the whole thing was a setup the German government colluded with the Arabs to stage the hijacking simply to rid themselves of the captured terrorists and to avoid the embarrassment of a trial.

If you're desperate for it to be making a political point you're bound to be disappointed, especially as that implies that you have a political viewpoint that you want to be confirmed - this film won't do that. It isn't a film about politics - it is a film about people and how people work; about the nature of good and evil (not of good VS evil, as everyone else seems to be reading it). It is ultimately philosophical more than political, and most of all about the nature and effects of what the religious would call sin. If there was one point that came across it was that humans aren't born evil in the original sin type of sense, but they are born *responsive* into a world that contains evil.The film forces you to be put into a position where you are made to empaphise with people who you strongly disagree with, and this feels distasteful. That's because it is, but it is most definitely valid. One of the early scenes featured the terrorist describing his childhood and how he had grown up in a refugee camp, knowing that his only chance in life came with the possibility of a Palestinian homeland - much as you hated it, you began to find yourself realising that from his viewpoint he had every right to fight for freedom and the opportunity that every child *should* deserve. You also knew that from an objective moral viewpoint his act was heinous and should be punished (after all he wasn't without choice at the point when the act occurred). You were also presented with the irony that the Israeli athlete most focused on was intent on living at peace with those of other races (i didn't see this as an attempt to make a generalisation about the Israelis so much as an attempt to show that generalisations don't work). And so his wife and child are left with the difficult choice of whether to follow the completely natural response of hatred and bitterness or somehow find an alternative way. And then there were the Germans who were keen to either set right or leave behind their shameful past and ended up just providing a stage for the terrorists and a show of their own incompetence in dealing with them.I'm not saying this film was perfect, but bizarrely considering its subject i don't think it is primarily making a political point.

You would have to be LIVING in a vacum not to know their plight, and it's hard to argue that terrorists are human.  Besides, the surviving terrorist spoke about talking and joking with the prisoners, a momentary respite for the viewer as it must have been for those involved.  As far as absolving the Israeli gov't, the point was obvious and well made, no Israeli and even Jew for that matter could feel safe if the demands were met.  And none of criticisms state provide any evidence for their complaints I might add.That being said, as a Historian, there are some rather speculative aspects to the documentary.  For example, Douglas states that the East Germans helped the terrorists scope the place out before hand, but it is unclear whether they knew of their intentions or not (ala the americans helping them in), which is a major fault in the fact presenting.  Also rather curious was how Douglas tells how the plane hijacking was a scam, and then states the surviving terrorist confirmed this, which to me indicates they set up this scenario for the interviewee and he merely said 'yes.'The main point of this documentary is for the viewer to ask how, not why. How could everything fall apart as it did? I left wondering how in Cold War Europe, an extraction team from East Germany, England, France, Russia, ect., could not have been employed within hours and how much did Cold War politics played into that factor.

But their real coup would be to have interviewed the one and only surviving terrorist who partook in the horror against the spirit of the Olympics.It also provides those born after 1972, or too young to remember, a look at the events surrounding that day - from the Olympic organizers who are too arrogant to suspend the games, the indifference of the athletes in the Olympic Village, the lack of adequate security (as compared to today), to the politics behind the entire affairs.Perhaps what will rile you are the West German's botched attempt to rescue the hostages.They were surprisingly ill-prepared, deploying untrained teams, lack of proper equipment, and had to recall countless of attempts, before the final embarrassment at the airport, which exposed their severe weakness at handling terrorist incidents. All the hostages were killed in the confrontation, when the terrorists threw hand grenades and emptied bullets into the helicopters they were in. It's only after this that the Germans formed their anti-terror squad, the GSG9 (Counter-strike players will be familiar with this term).To make matters worse, there was a cover up and collusion between the Germans and the terrorists when the latter apparently hijacked a Lufthansa flight (with only 12 passengers on board, and no women and children), and the former handed over the 3 surviving terrorists of the Munich incident in exchange for safe passage of the flight.Which is where Spielberg's movie comes in, following squads of Mossad agents hunting down and assassinating those 3 (1 managed to survive countless attempts on his life), together with others who are implicated or involved in the planning of the Munich operation.This documentary provides an excellent and compelling background, preparing you for the Munich movie coming soon.

It really is a gripping piece of work, with no sides taken in delivering the true story of what happened that fateful day in September.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the event, or just to history buffs in general.  I think almost anyone who sees the film will learn a lot of information about the incident, and I would urge them to do so.  Highly Recommended.

The ineptness of the German's in every aspect of this tragedy is almost incomprehensible and certainly reprehensible. To hear the interviews with those Germans involved, one would be inclined to share in their obvious amusement at such incompetence were it not for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes. And so one watches this film in three stages, with sadness, disbelief and then anger. For those not yet initiated to the most tragic event in Olympic history, on September 5, 1972, a week into the Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists entered the Olympic compound and held hostage 9 members of the Israeli Olympic team, after already killing two who attempted resistance. Their demands were the release of 200 terrorists held primarily by Israel. Israel maintained its policy of no negotiations with terrorist while the Germans, anxious to get on with the games, attempted to negotiate a settlement that was never possible. In the end they bungled a rescue operation and all the hostages were murdered. ONE DAY IN September takes a much closer look at the facts, which should be a revelation for those ignorant of the European history of appeasement and the current crisis between radical Islamists and the West. In their desire not to be a target for terrorism, after having three of the Munich terrorists in custody, Germany arranged for the hijacking of a commercial airliner as a means to release their captives with a fictional hostage exchange scheme. One of them still lives to proudly tell his tale. The other two were hunted down and killed by Israel, acts that no doubt sparked condemnation from Germany and the UN.

It's an enormously thrilling and informative documentary, and Macdonald covers the event in meticulous detail, but it also plays out like a music video, with hit songs playing over footage of bloodied dead bodies and little attention given to the background of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.The film opens with an Olympic promotional video which the Germans no doubt hoped would help banish the world's memories of concentration camps and mass genocide, in favour of a more welcoming, laid-back Germany. Though documentaries on the whole are supposed to be objective, it's clear that Macdonald holds disdain for the German authorities, who bungled the entire operation from start to finish. Rather than a tight security force, the Olympic committee opted instead for a dressed-down and unarmed group of workers who strolled the Olympic village with no idea of the horrors to come. With heavy news coverage of the incident from journalists around the world, the terrorists were able to watch as volunteers armed themselves for a rescue operation on the TV in their room, and thankfully warned the authorities of this before the inevitable blood-bath occurred.While the idea of efficiency is something that would normally go hand-in-hand with Germany, the only thing efficient about the whole saga was the quickly-handled release of three captured terrorists, who escaped custody when some Palestinians hijacked a plane and demanded their release. In a film chocked full of startling revelations, the most damning is the reveal that the Germany authorities arranged the entire thing. Questions were raised after it was discovered that the plane contained only a small number of passengers, of which none were women and children. Of all the incidents they should hang their in shame for, simply wanting to wash their hands of the whole ordeal at the expense of justice is unforgivable. Macdonald doesn't just rely on conspiracy theories either, with first-hand accounts from police, ranking members of the army, journalists, family members of the victims, and most startlingly, Jamal Al-Gashey, the only surviving member of the Black September group to take part in the events at Munich.It was a tragedy from start to finish, and along with the bumbling behaviour of the Germans, was doomed to disaster from the very start. Macdonald builds up this sense of inevitability, and the horror climaxes with ABC anchor Jim McKay's live report after it emerged that their worst fears have finally been realised, and that the Israeli athletes held for less than 24 hours were all gone,. Had Macdonald offered some background into the origins of Black September and the tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians, this may have been a masterpiece, Also, the massacre at the closing stages would have been the all more heartbreaking were it not for Macdonald's rock and roll style and gratuitous imagery. Still, this is powerful, well- researched stuff, and should be watched by anyone interested in this avoidable act of horror as the definitive account of that one day in September.

If you saw the film Munich, which I recommend, you will see what happened to the other terrorists at the hands of the Israelis.This is a particularly anger-provoking documentary. There was minimum security at that Olympics so as not to upset the athletes. Okay. The Germans, of all people, did not have an anti- terrorist group, and their police were Keystone Cops.Israel offered to help, but they were turned down.In other words, any rescue attempt was ruined before it started.The Germans made lots of plans to rescue the athletes, and these were dutifully reported by the television press. Unfortunately, all the rooms holding the hostages had televisions, so the terrorists could see and hear about the plans before they happened.I did not feel that this documentary took sides, except in showing the incompetence of the Germans and the Olympics administration. The interview with Jamal Al Gashey was extensive, giving a play by play of what happened. He claimed there was no intention to kill the athletes. Well, they're dead.Worse yet, everyone was told that the final rescue attempt was successful and all of the hostages were alive, only for the families to find out later the news was incorrect. I can't get into a discussion of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. I also have absolutely no intention of putting this heinous act into perspective, although the Palestinians have a viable point of view. I just don't think that was the way to address it. There is no perspective that justifies killing innocent people and holding them for ransom. The Israelis weren't going to give them anything -- if they did, no Israeli anywhere would have been safe.The Olympics make an attempting to further camaraderie among nations and bring people together. The wife of one of the victims gave a very poignant recitation, as did her daughter, who never knew her father.Sadly, in this world, there are many children who never knew their fathers, thanks to years and years of Middle East conflict. What's the answer? I don't even know the question.

Because of this, I looked forward to seeing One Day in September. However, even if you remember the events rather clearly, you should still see this exceptionally well made film--mostly because the epilogue is rather sad and alarming.This documentary is narrated by Michael Douglas and consists of many interviews (one of which, inexplicably, is with the surviving terrorist), contemporary footage and a few re-creations using computers. It explains step-by-step how the incidents occurred as well as the aftermath. It's all naturally very sad but also frustrating because the German authorities were so very incompetent--blowing so many opportunities and allowing LIVE news feeds which showed the German policemen sneaking up to the apartment where the terrorists held their victims! Duh. In fact, it's one screw up after another and it is both sad and maddening--especially the epilogue. I'd say more but I don't want to ruin the film.

The Israeli team during the Munich Olympics was featured because they were on the all-star list. In fact all the contenders were stars as they always are during these world competitions. Of course we know their names. We have access to the names of every contestant and finally, every winner and loser. The fact that they come with biographies certainly isn't any surprise. That's the nature of the Olympics. We don't know much of anything about the terrorists. They weren't the athletes in the competition. Why should we know about them? This excellent film does not take sides, as hard as it must have been to avoid, or make any overtly political statements and this has been criticized in some quarters. Instead of presenting a political diatribe or a hate machine or a propaganda film, this documentary sticks to the facts, presented chronologically for the main part, and leaves the viewer to draw any conclusions. There are some conclusions we can hardly avoid but the film doesn't abet in trying to sway us. This is simply a tragedy reviewed and the inability to deal with the circumstances leading up to it in any practical way. The film whizzed by, as painful as part of it was to watch. There wasn't much to see about the personal reactions.

Michael Douglas narrates, beautifully. for me, the interviews with survivors and family members were less interesting than the live-action scenes of the terror attack as it happened. it was especially moving to see Jim McKay (They're all gone) and a little astonishing to watch the newspeople giving a play by play about the rescue attempt, which the terrorists were watching on TV along with the rest of us!I dimly remember the event, but I had either never known or had forgotten the details. for example, how truly craven the Olympic officials were--after Israel flew its dead back home, the games continued. (it's interesting watching it now, after the IOC's refusal to give a moment of silence at the 2012 London Olympics.) this is a very important movie for people to see. among other things, it reminds us that haters can always find a pretext for killing the people they despise. that's something we should especially remember these days, when another film is setting the Muslim world on fire, literally.

It is the ideal that dates back to ancient times when the Greeks themselves invented the Olympics.But on September 5, 1972, in an ordeal that lasted into the early morning hours of the following day, the Olympic ideal was brutally attacked when members of a shadow Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September hopped over the fence at the Olympic Village in Munich and killed two Israeli athletes, holding nine others hostage and threatening to kill them unless their demands for freeing two hundred political prisoners were met. With Israel point-blank refusing to negotiate, and having to take responsibility for this, a rag-tag German hit squad unleashed their firepower on the terrorists at the Furstenfeldbruck airfield just outside of Munich; and although three of the eight terrorists were eventually captured and the other five died in the mêlée, so too did the remaining nine Israeli athletes. It was the first act of terrorism ever televised to an international audience; and in 1999, it was the focus of the Oscar-winning documentary ONE DAY IN September.Narrated by Michael Douglas, ONE DAY IN September examines, in a span of only ninety-one minutes, the way the 1972 Summer Olympics were laid out, and how it led to what took place. Munich was, just four decades before, the epicenter of the Nazi movement; and when it was awarded the '72 Games, memories of Hitler's 1936 Berlin Games, as well as the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust, were still fresh in the population's memories. The organizers of Munich '72 were determined to make it as different from Hitler's Games as was humanly possible; and while theirs were noble and good intentions, it turned out to be their undoing. The perimeter of the Olympic Village was a mere rusty fence, as opposed to sturdier materials like barbed wire (so as not to look like a concentration camp like Dachau, which was only seven miles away), and the security guards not only had no visible firearms on them, they didn't even look like security guards to begin with. This was how the eight Black September militants scaled the fence, with the unintentional help of drunk American athletes, and broke into the Israeli apartment at Connollystrasse 31. A great deal of negotiating between West Germany and Black September ensued, and the world was transfixed to their televisions, as they watched what had been up to that moment a peaceful Olympic celebration suddenly turned into the most overt act of terrorism the world had seen to that point.Attempts by the West German government to end the standoff by force were totally unsuccessful (the country had no counter-terrorism force of its own, and relied on municipal cops); and when the terrorists and the hostages were transported by helicopters to Furstenfeldbruck, the situation took the ultimate horrifying turn. A whole horde of untrained German snipers unloaded on the airfield; and over the next forty-five minutes, all hell broke loose. Once the mêlée was over, officials of the West German government and the Munich Olympic Committee had stated that the terrorists had been killed, but the Israelis had been saved. Later on, of course, it was revealed that something totally different had transpired. It was up to ABC sportscaster Jim McKay to deliver the terrible news to the world They're all gone. People who remember those terrible two days in September 1972 will certainly be reminded of them again when watching ONE DAY IN September; and those who only know of 9/11 will be reminded of how terrorism can turn good things bad in a hurry. The whole ordeal, down to the last horrifying battle at Furstenfeldbruck, was an act of well-meant but painfully inept West German planning; and while the decision to go on with the Olympic Games after the deaths may have been a way of both paying tribute to the murdered Israelis and thumbing its noses at terrorists, it was also extremely controversial. Scenes of athletic competition, including those of U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz and Russian gymnast Olga Korbut, are interspersed with the horrific events at Connollystrasse 31 to emphasize the tragic turn Munch '72 took in the span of only eighteen hours. The mood is emphasized further by Heffes' modern score, with contributions by Glass, and a performance of the Funeral March of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony, as performed by Rudolf Kempe and the Munich Philharmonic at the memorial for the athletes. In the end, ONE DAY IN September was richly deserving of the Oscar it got, and it should remind us all of how political terrorism not only poisoned the ultimate sporting event, but also led to far worse things to come.

A planned rescue by police is cancelled at the last minute.Eventually the Palestinians are offered a plane and a rescue mission is planned at the airport.

SPOILERS!","Date":"24 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Documentary","Review":" This piece of September terrorism refers to the kidnappings of Israeli athletes from the Munich Olympic village. 27yrs after the end of WWII, Munich in 1972 was the new face of German democracy trying hard to live down the country's shame over Hitler's propagandist 1936 Olympics. The documentary's prologue is a classic showcase of Olympic highlights, soundtracked by the Top Ten hit 'Joy' (by Apollo100 aka Tom Parker who 'remixed' Bach's 'Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring' into a really cool instrumental), which tugs at our heartstrings by really capturing the infectious optimism of the time.Much of the story revolves around Israeli fencing athlete Anki Spitzer, whose widow voices her memories of him. Be warned, no punches are pulled, and the whole story is revealed in its infuriating, stupid, disgusting, rather corrupt reality, although it strikes ME as a very balanced view. Both 'sides' cop criticism. It's a terrific lesson in what NOT to do, because what happened was awful. Spitzer's widow, though, is amazingly even-handed; she takes solace in her warm, private memories of her dead husband.As soon as the news of the 1972 terrorism broke on television, there was public world-wide outrage that the spirit of optimism of the Games should be so disgustingly undermined. There was also outrage at the unfeeling continuation of the Games during it. Remember the Macabia Games a few years ago in Israel? The same thing happened there, albeit with accidentally drowning athletes. WHAT IS IT with Games organisers having no heart? Apparently the main objective in 1972 was always to restart the Games; any rescue of the hostages was considered almost secondary! They are criticised in the doco for being so 'arrogant' to suppose they 'had nothing to do with' it.The terrorists, handing a communique to police, wanted, in their obstinate rhetoric 'the release of >200 revolutionary prisoners' from jails all over the world!! The unrealistic nature of their demands is frustrating. (Demands couched in rhetoric are DESIGNED to be unfulfillable, because it's posturing, to give the terrorists the excuse to commit the violence they WENT THERE FOR. It's essentially a brainwashing & bullying technique. Look, the same scummy technique is used in prisons etc; and 'revolutionary acts' often get corrupted into nothing but male egotistical domination. Surprised? Well, we should all KNOW BETTER ANYONE spouting rhetoric (ie highly calculated and DIRECTED party line), should immediately be anathema to everybody. THAT'S the lesson. The German negotiators obviously felt completely befuddled, shocked, and frustrated they knew NOTHING about these obstinate, violent terrorists, who eventually turned out to be the very-extreme-left-wing Black September. The visage of the hooded terrorist stalking the balcony of the Olympic village, displayed on this video cover, haunts us still.The group of Palestinian terrorists + Israeli hostages were supposed to be evacuated to Munich airport by helicopter from the Olympic village. The German police were planning an ambush at the airport for the supposed 4-5 terrorists, but as the group cautiously began to enter the 2 helicopters, it became clear that in fact there were 8 terrorists, with only 5 patently undertrained and undersupplied German policemen to counter them. The Germans had no communications equipment, no bulletproof vests, or even helmets! They did not coordinate their targets, and no-one advised them that there were MORE terrorists coming than expected. One of the police marksmen was ridiculously exposed, right in the line of fire between his colleagues and the terrorists, and he had no helmet! I think he never ever let off a single shot. Curious onlookers clogged the roads to the airport, so police reinforcements didn't arrive until an hour after the shooting began, by which time most of the firefight was over. When they did arrive, they mistook two of the police snipers for terrorists and opened fire on them! What a joke!After almost 2 hrs of fighting, the terrorists decided to destroy the helicopters, full of hostages. Nine hostages were killed then and there. The doco powerfully reveals how offensive this massacre was (it's irrelevant to the ugliness what their nationality was). The music that accompanies the staccato montage of the police photos of the burnt-out bodies is very affecting. Later, the bodies of 5 dead terrorists were handed back to Libya. I suspect this is where Lybia's rep as a 'terrorist state' and the phrase 'Palestinian terrorist' comes from. The terrorists mainly seemed to want fame '...they made their voice heard by the universe who had not been hearing before' (urgh, this is called 'posturing', so maybe Black September pi**ed off some of their own people). However, the 3 surviving terrorists were never to stand trial, because the Germans handed them back 7 weeks later. 'Acting with indecent haste and without consulting the Israeli government', Willy Brandt, the charismatic German head of government, colluded with the terrorists in order to 1) dispose of the embarrassing evidence of German tactical failures, and 2) to discourage further terrorist attacks on his country.By 1999 secret Israeli assassination squads killed 2/3 surviving Palestinian terrorists, plus some 12 others suspected of having planned the terrorist act (presumably including Carlos 'The Jackal', who supposedly was one of them, but apparently(?) left his mates in Munich as soon as the 'kaka' started hitting the fan). The only still surviving Black September-ite, Jamal Al-Gashey, speaks of his 1972 actions here for the first time. He has survived many attempts on his life and lives in hiding with a wife and two daughters- compromising them still.The documentary is necessarily sad and depressing with such realism, but at least everyone cops some criticism. Black September seem to have been more interested in their own self-aggrandisement, so I'm guessing that some of those assassinations should NOT BE SO QUICKLY attributed to Mossad. Mr Al-Gashey looked none-too-comfortable to me...Sadly, people's tolerance for violence goes in cycles what is 'acceptable' depends on whom you live near. ETHICAL RELATIVISM IS A TERRIBLE THING.

The film is heavily weighted to a representation which condemns the German authorities and sanctifies the terrorists' victims. The hatchet job done on the Germans is pretty rough &#150; given they were in a fairly untenable position, it's terribly unfair to condemn them in hindsight. This aspect of the film displays remarkable petulance. I have fewer reservations about how the Israelis and the Palestinians are each represented, I guess I don't expect it to be any other way. It's the kind of documentary that demands a responding documentary, but alas, I don't see one forthcoming. With all that said the dynamic structure of One Day in September is its most impressive aspect. With all the political implications surrounding the film the best moments are those sequences when the sportsmen and women are set to music. They're invigorating moments and perhaps overshadow the significance of the terrorist incident by contrasting man's evil doings to the eternal beauty of mankind in the pursuit of the limits of his physical capabilities.

Outside some questionable uses of music, this is a pretty strong documentary that features some great interviews with many of the people on the scene. We get interviews with some of the police negotiators, family members of victims and most shockingly is the last living terrorist who for the first time talks about the operation. There have been quite a few documentaries on this subject but this one here is without question one of the most interesting because of the people that were interviewed. It's was great getting to hear from the people who were involved in the negotiations and of course it was interesting to hear from the last remaining terrorist. With narration from Michael Douglas, the film does a very good job at mixing the interviews with the archival footage and it really gives you a great idea of the events and everything that was going on. This is especially true when you see some live TV broadcasts and learn that this hurt the police because the terrorist were inside watching and seeing that a raid was about to happen, which caused the first rescue mission to be canceled. The blunders of the German police are also on full display and it's really shocking to see how badly the entire thing was handled and especially the finale at the airport. Then, of course, there's the supposed hijacking, which led to the three surviving terrorists to get off without being punished (for the time).

Michael Douglas' drawling voice is - thankfully - not applied often throughout the documentary.All in all interesting, but if it weren't for Ankie Spitzer and a few other voices chiming in here, there wouldn't be much more than a cinematic equivalent of a Wikipedia entry to this.

It's rather one-sided as well, with only a brief look into the Palestinian motives and a much longer and more sympathetic treatment of the Israeli victims . . . but it's hard to get too worked up on terrorists' behalf.  Other than these minor complaints, I thought the documentary was stylish, fascinating, and well paced.

The stories they tell go beyond even the bizarre and amazing revelations presented as fact in One Day in September. Others have traveled down this path before, in print, on TV and in the official film of the XX Olympiad, the interesting but very uneven Visions of Eight. The whole truth is too complex to be told. Surprised? By 1999, both Alexander Scourby and David Perry were gone. The filmmakers settle for Hollywood heavyweight Michael Douglas as offscreen narrator.

My comments here are really more about the criticisms of the film than the film itself. I've read several comments about ONE DAY IN September from Europeans lamenting its treatment of the Germans and Palestinians. As an American, I admit much more sympathy for Israel than Palestine (despite the USA's shameful record on race, at least we didn't launch the Holocaust), but the film is more about the killing of the innocent (and bungled German efforts to save them) than a deep historical treatment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (For that, I'd recommend FIFTY-YEAR WAR, a PBS Frontline documentary.) And I'm not sure it's totally unfair to condemn the Germans for failing to even have an anti-terrorist unit, considering that terrorism was already a rising problem in Europe by 1972. This film isn't objective and isn't obligated to be -- if a counterpart film appears, I'd certainly watch, but I don't expect it to elicit much sympathy on my side of the pond.

I would like to point out the most severe instances*  The East German olympics team helped the Palestinian terrorists to stake out the premises at the Olympic village. -- Even though the documentary presents this as a fact (as usual, without offering any evidence), as far as I know this allusion is far from being proven.  As is evident from the rest of the movie, the security at the 1972 Olympics was generally rather lax and the Palestinians still didn't have a good idea of the premises (they didn't know much beyond the address of the Israeli trainers and hadn't properly planned their escape).*  The German army had marksmen, but they couldn't be used because of legal red tape. ... The Bundeswehr only introduced proper (i. e. specially trained and equipped) marksmen in 1997, until then all they had was so - called ZF = Zielfernrohrschützen which used a regular G3 automatic rifle with a 4* scope (i. e. a regular army rifle and not a specialised sniper rifle).*  The German government colluded with hijackers of Lufthansa airliner so that they could get rid of the three surviving terrorists. -- Complete and utter nonsense.  How on earth could the German government have aided the hijackers?  By phoning them and saying hi, we would like to get rid of the terrorists, could you please hijack a plane so as to give us a flimsy excuse, and could you please hijack flight LH1234 from Beirut coz there are no women and children on board?  In other words, does anyone really think that the Palestinian terrorists needed an official invitation from the German government?  Please don't insult my intelligence.*  The German government gave in surprisingly quickly considering that the hijackers only held 12 hostages. -- That is actually one hostage MORE than the Olympics terrorists held.  If the German government was quick to give in, it was most likely because they had anticipated this situation, they were very aware that there was practically nothing they could do about it, and were eager to avoid further bloodshed.  Basically the movie is blaming the Germans for not sacrificing 12 of their citizens.*  German government should have consulted Israeli government for permission before handing over Palestinian terrorists. -- What on earth for?  They knew the official Israeli position (i. e. never give in to Palestinian terrorists, no matter what the cost) only too well!  Exchanging the terrorists for the hostages certainly wasn't very heroic, but the hijackers held 12 hostages, what choice did the government have?*  German government was quick to hand over the surviving terrorists because they wanted to cover up their blunder. -- What was there to cover up?  ALL the hostages, as well as most of the terrorists, were dead, several policemen had been killed or wounded -- the outcome was obviously catastrophic.  The head of Mossad along with other independent witnesses was on site in Fürstenfeldbruck.  The entire mess was in plain sight, there was nothing to cover up.Incidentally, one can equally well speculate that the German authorities had NO interest in a trial (because it would have focussed public interest on blunders that led to the death of all the hostages) as well as that they HAD a vested interest so that Germany could be seen as taking a firm stand against terrorism or to reconcile with Israel.  On the other hand, you can also speculate that Israel had no interest in a trial because it would have given the terrorists the chance to propagate their political views during the trial, and it would have placed them in a German prison, out of reach for Mossad who wanted to see them dead.  The key word here is speculation.*  Ulrich Wegener and Hans - Jochen Vogel admitted to the collusion of Germany with the Beirut hijackers ... at least that is clearly the impression given by the movie in the following scene (I have translated it partially from German to English, so the verbiage might not be exact)The circumstances of the hijack were suspicious ...  One of the Palestinians opined that the whole affair had been staged by the German government in collusion with the terrorists, to avoid further threats to its citizens and to cover up its blunder.Ulrich Wegener  I think it's probably true.  At that time the mentality was so.Hans - Jochen Vogel  On such questions Willy Brandt the federal chancellor always made this gesture shrugs ... meaning I can't say or do more.You can't hear what questions the interviewer was asking, but I think it is quite clear that it wasn't did the German government collude with the Beirut hijackers?.  I would opine that this scene is pure, manipulative propaganda.  If you have the video or DVD, check it out for yourself.*  German authorities wanted to move the hostages and terrorists out of the Olympic village as quickly as possible so that the games could continue. -- I doubt whether the hijackers were much concerned about what the German side wanted.  The initiative came strictly from the terrorists themselves.  As Jamal Al Gashey states in his interview, they had been instructed to finish the operation within 24 hours, and to demand to be flown out of Germany before this deadline.*  Germans should have allowed Mossad in., Mossad could have solved the situation and prevented bloodshed. -- Mossad is a secret service, not an anti - terrorism police force, which is noted even by the CIA for its ruthless and plainly illegal actions;  allowing them to operate in the Olympic village was therefore clearly out of the question.  Even on an international level, specialised anti - terrorism forces only came into existence after, and mostly in response to, the September 1972 attentat. CNN states on its website  Munich was a watershed. In great measure, it has been since 1972 that the general public has submitted to security searches in airports, arenas and other public events -- and learned to live with the threat of terrorism.*  Germany was criminally negligent about security at the Olympic games. -- This is equal to saying that JFK was negligent to have driven in an open car through Dallas, or that there should have been anti - aircraft missiles on top of the World Trade Center;  with hindsight, it is easy to be prophetic.  Clearly, not even the Israeli side envisaged that such an attack would have been possible.  Also, as the film states, at least some of its representatives came to Munich as a gesture of we are still alive, you couldn't kill us.  So what should the German police have done -- put them under 24 - hour armed surveillance, and house them in a segregated, high - security unit?*  German authorites handled the crisis incompetently. -- No question, but at the time, and lacking specialised police forces, who wouldn't have?  I think they did the best they could and were clearly very concerned about the security of the Israelis;  in fact the movie shows that the then secretary for the interior Hans - Dietrich Genscher even offered himself as a hostage.*  The Olympics should have been interrupted immediately. -- By the way, this decision was handled by the IOC headed by the American Avery Brundage, NOT by the German side.  Personally I agree that the Olympics should have been interrupted immediately, and for a longer mourning period, but I can also see that the IOC didn't want to be seen as giving in to terrorists. Typically for the maliciously manipulative style of the movie, IOC members are being shown at a party eating and drinking at the same time as the voiceover tells of their failure to halt the games immediately, thereby suggesting that they didn't care for the plight of the hostages.I would also like to reply to some of the statements made by previous reviewers *  One reviewer wrote  the crazed excited facial expression of the Palestinian killers in the interview near the end of the movie reminds me of the faces of the old nazi on stand at Nuremberg ... at least in the material shown in the movie, the hijackers didn't exhibit any such behaviour, so the producers of One Day In September used slow motion and zoomed in on Jamal Al Gashey as he was squinting, essentially using a very manipulative technique that would make even Britney Spears look menacing. In fact Jamal Al Gashey, who at the time of the crime was not even 20 years old, was somewhat of a poster boy terrorist, smiling and friendly looking. And by the way, I would like to know which scenes of the Nuremberg trial you are referring to -- generally the Nazis on trial there were noted for being rather ordinary - looking.  For Christ's sake, this isn't Hollywood where all the villains have scars and wear black hats.*  I had no idea just how ill-prepared, unprofessional, and callously negligent German law enforcement was during the whole affair. -- Callously negligent implies that German police wasn't too bothered about the Israelis... hey, they're only Jews, har, har, and that's obviously unfounded crap. Ill - prepared and unprofessional -- at the time specialised anti - terrorism units didn't exist in Europe, and practically at all world wide.*  this documentary shows how the German response to the attack was, well, one which many W.W. II era German leaders would have enjoyed---total indifference, even obstruction. -- Just for your information, apart from the fact that not even the movie suggests German indifference or obstruction, the political party in power at that time was the SPD (Social Democrats), who were the only party to have voted, and unanimously, against Hitler's Ermächtigungsgesetz, and who were massively prosecuted by the Nazis.  Then federal chancellor and peace Nobel prize winner Willy Brandt spent the Nazi era in exile.  Exactly who are you accusing of what?There is no doubt that severe mistakes were being made that led to the terrible killing of all the Israeli hostages, and the documentary would of course have been entitled to point them out.  Instead, the film makers seemed to think that the reality hadn't been quite gruesome enough, so they produced a movie that is nothing less but modern - day propaganda.  That the Academy Of Motion Pictures felt it necessary to honour this effort with an Oscar was, in my opinion, a grave mistake.

But this is an important film for a number of reasons, and prospective viewers ought not to be put off by the thinly-veiled hatred of the blame-Israel-first crowd.First, the film methodically sets out details of one of the most brutal and indecent mass kidnappings and murders of the last 50 years. It is in this section of the film we learn just how depraved and fanatical is the mind of the Palestinian extremist. The extent of their depravity helps us to understand our own current problems with Arab extremists.Second, the film reveals what appears to be incomprehensible incompetence on the part of the German government, as they marshal a law-enforcement response that seems deliberately designed to spare terrorists and kill Israeli's. The viewer already knows, of course, that all 11 hostages died, while 3 of the 8 terrorists survived.Finally, in what turns out to be the films most shocking revelation, we learn the true connection between the German and Palestinian governments, explaining why what happened at Munich was anything but an accident. Seems like the Germans never get tired of seeing Jews killed.If this all seems improbable to you, then see this film for yourself.

I write today as the European governments condemn Israel for the assassination of the founder of Hamas which has sent so many children and mothers to their graves - both the mothers and children sent to commit suicide, and the mothers and children killed in those suicides. There is a moral abyss in much of Europe where terrorism against Israel is concerned.It's revealed well in this poorly made documentary about the astonishing cowardice, incompetence and resignation of the German government, armed forces and police. (I am simply staggered that the German police fled from their assigned roles in the German plan to capture/kill the hijackers on the airplane -- out of stark craven fear of being hurt. Amazing!).The documentary is poorly made - we seldom know the names or the roles of the speakers. There is no explanation why we see so much of the domestic life of one of the victims and nothing of the others. There is an enormous lapse in the narrative of the scene at the airport after the helicopters are blown up and sprayed with gunfire. (Presumably the remaining hostages simply surrendered - but I have to guess). The most significant revelation of the movie is the alleged complicity of the German government in a subsequent hijacking and their quick surrender to the ostensibly bogus demands of the hijackers - yet we hear so little on this subject. (Why not interview everyone at the top of the German security services at the time?). The worst part of the documentary is the grotesque and jarring rock music played at the most inappropriate times.However, the subject itself is so dramatic, the repeatedly pathetic reaction of the German police so astounding, that the film is still compelling to watch. (Yet again, WHY was the German Army not permitted to participate in the siege of the hijackers at the Olympics site? We are simply told they were not - as is typical in this movie, without explanation).As far as the demand by some reviewers here for more context into the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, the comments are absurd - should we have had more context into whether Jews were really demons in the movies, Schindler's List or Shoah? How about more context on whether 14 million Ukrainians really did deserve to die of imposed famine in the USSR in a movie about Stalin? Such demands are sickening in the face of this barbarity. The objections by Karl to the movie are mostly fallacious. Perhaps he saw the movie too long ago, for he repeatedly incorrectly quotes the movie and then objects to the fallacy he introduces!It's unfortunate that this poor documentary may be the only one that emerges in which there is an interview of the bestial sole living hijacker. (I kept thinking as I watched, why can't the interviewer just gun him down as he speaks?). That hijacker does provide interesting information - particularly about how long before the whole operation was organized, the ease with which they moved in the Olympic Village, and of course the utter moral depravity of the actions taken. So, I'd recommend seeing it - for the compelling subject matter and the producer's ability to cadge an interview with the hijacker - but it does amaze me that it won an Oscar because it's a pretty bad documentary.

To be fair there is quiet a bit early on to put the situation in some sort of perspective and the surviving terrorist and his opinions are given plenty of air time.You don't hear much crying from the same quarters decrying one sidedness or bias when Michael Moore makes one of his ridiculous, so called, documentaries.

When Kevin McDonald set out to make a documentary on what happened there then its hardly surprising that we see a film dealing with the events on that terrible day. If he set out to make a documentary on Palestine and how it was taken off the Arabs by the Jew's then he would have set to that task and not dwelt too much on how the Jew's had been banished from there two thousand years ago after moses had been promised this and that.As with the BBC journalist crying when Arafat was lifted out of his compound for the last time or those who would attempt a defense of the Palestinian murder spree in Munich there seems to be a different reality or level of understanding needed when it comes to issues about Palestine or its people so its hardly surprising that a documentary like this would raise hackles.This is an excellent film.

I can't believe this won the Oscar for Best Documentary in 1999.  Is the director the nephew of someone at the Academy?  If the subject itself weren't so interesting (and he has picked a great subject, make no mistake), this movie would be unwatchable.  OK, before I get carried away with invective, let me back up my dismay with some actual observations...For starters, from a directorial point of view, this is one of the most ineptly put together films I've seen in a long time.  McDonald pads his film constantly with highly stylized filler, throwing in Godfrey Reggio-inspired time-lapse photography of traffic (just as one example) in places where it does absolutely nothing to advance the story or give us more info.  It's as though he doesn't trust the subject itself to be interesting enough, like he feels he needs to hold our attention with cinematographic tricks.  Hey, Kevin--it's distracting and annoying.  You've got a great subject here--just let it speak to us.  There are points, too, where he lets grainy footage of certain tense moments roll on for much too long, in ways that get a little dull and also don't advance the story.  Could've been tightened up a bit...He also clearly thinks the sun shines out of Errol Morris's anus.  He may even be right, but copying that style doesn't help his film, either.  He isn't creating a character study of oddballs and social outcasts who will end up telling us unexpectedly profound things about life (Morris), nor is he making some grand visionary statement about the world (Reggio)--he's ostensibly documenting a real historical event, and I think he would've done a much better job by just presenting the facts and letting the audience take it all in.  He seems to trust neither our patience nor our intelligence.  Blah...On top of all that, he uses music that is so wholly inappropriate for the scenes over which it is laid that the juxtaposition ends up being laughable.  The use of music in this film is in such poor taste that it can't help but be further distracting.  It's even music that I really like, but used in such completely terrible ways that I couldn't let this review go by without commenting on it.  Just awful...Finally, and most importantly, McDonald just doesn't seem to have put together his film in a way that says anything.  He flirts with making some sort of political statement but either pulls his punches or just botches it so terribly that I'm not sure what he's trying to say.  The human drama he tries to portray is somehow not nearly as affecting as it could've (and should've) been, in large part because the elements commented on earlier keep inserting themselves loudly and obnoxiously in between the viewer and the subject.  He does virtually no job at all of putting these events into any sort of historical context--if you come to this film without an understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict then everything that happens seems random and meaningless.  Lastly, and perhaps most egregiously, the film just seems awfully unfulfilling.  As it ends one has the sense that one has just watched an incredibly important historical event presented in a way that makes it seem confusing and boring.  It seemed I should perhaps feel angry about something or sad about something but all I could do is marvel at what a horrible job was done with this movie.OK, to balance things a little I'll say this.  There are some interesting factual revelations in the film--in particular the much-commented-on West German cover-up of their horrible mismanagement of the whole affair and their conspiracy to release the three surviving extremists.  In general, in fact, I'd say this movie is a decent (though by no means good) presentation of the facts in the case.  If you don't know anything about the kidnapping, this is an OK enough place to start in terms of understanding the progression of events.  On the other hand, where it fails miserably is in terms of giving those facts any weight or dimension.  You will not walk away from this movie with any depth of understanding of the events, and that is the greatest crime a historical documentary can commit.  Too often Kevin McDonald tries too hard to make slick, entertaining Hollywood-style drama out of this incredibly sad story and commits the Hey, Ma--look at me!  I'm making a movie! error of drawing attention to himself and his film, interfering with the film's capacity to reach out to the audience.  Sad and bungled, though more or less well-intentioned...

To make a drama based on these events might be dismissed as merely bad taste, but to pedal such an emotionally manipulative piece of propaganda as documentary, as reflecting the truth of this tragedy is sooo dodgy! I wonder what Leni would have thought had it been entirely her work. If you're going to watch this film at least try to see how it's put together and don't just succumb to its spin; It will try to make you just feel, when perhaps a little thought is what has been called for.

One Day in September, however, concentrates more on the human interest of the event itself, neglecting background information in order to convey a one-sided and grossly biased perspective on a tragic occurrence.Viewing the film with all magnanimity, Kevin Macdonald probably never intended to create a deep or balanced work. One Day in September recounts events in the style of a Hollywood suspense film, replete with a ticking clock for added suspect, a bombastic rock soundtrack and the narration of Michael Douglas. This approach, by reducing events to those one might find in a facile thriller, serves only to trivialise a grave and real happening.The most glaring problem with One Day in September, however, is that it neither explores the underlying issues behind the Israeli-Palestinian tensions or endeavours to explain the motives of the terrorists responsible for the hostage taking. Instead, it villifies them and, more offensively, the German authorities who were understandably loathe to use force as a means of freeing the hostages.There is no doubt that the events of the 1972 Munich Olympic Games were brutal and atrocious, but that is not a reason to automatically venerate any attempt at their portrayal. This seems to be a mistake made by some, however, including the Academy, which awarded One Day in September an Oscar in preference to the far superior Buena Vista Social Club. A documentary that manipulates narrative content as a means to propagandising the creator's opinion is, in ways, more deplorable than the tritest of films, and thus there can be no excuse for this sort of biased, unbalanced work.

The provocative background music featuring 70s music gives you a feel of the period. Footage of Olga Korbut's sweet smile and Japan volleyball team's exhilaration after winning gold medals shows what the Olympic spirit should be about. The outstanding footage of the hostage crisis itself is great in its detail, thanks to the overwhelming presence of world media for the Olympics, while the melancholic live reportage of ABC anchor Jim McKay is just superb. So was the interviews of participants of the crisis, giving us many views of the events from many perspectives, including from one of the hostage-takers himself, who gave the interview while still hiding from Mossad's assassins. Unfortunately, the documentary didn't tell much about motives and background of the Palestinian plight, other than a 5-second footage of a refugee camp. The whole reference to the Nazi Olympics seemed designed to paint the Germans in a bad light in preparation of the subsequent unproven allegations of German collusion in the 3 surviving terrorists' release. The emotional interview with the former Mossad chief seems to imply that Germans don't care about Israeli lives, forgetting one German policeman was killed trying to release the Israelis. And the way the Israelis were treated like saints also feels like an excessive attempt to force our sympathy. More coverage of Black September and the Palestinians would give more justice. Or maybe the director is afraid of being called anti-Semitic or excusing terrorism?

This documentary is mostly an insidious editorial comment passing itself off as a reporting of the horrific events in Munich in 1972.  Everyone is pictured as being at fault except the Israelis.  The Olympic Committee is wining and dining itself while the crisis goes on.  The Germans are bungling and possibly in collusion with the terrorists, although a German policeman was killed in the shootout.  The games go on despite the slaughter.  Rock music is played over the terrible sight of the carnage.  Michael Douglas sounds self-righteously mournful.  The political background of the confrontation remains murky and mostly unexplained.  The Mossad was needed to take care of things later, although in fact their score wasn't perfect, as the relatives of the innocent Arab killed in Lillehammer might tell us.  We learn nothing except the bald events and are told what our response to them should be.Documentaries like this, clearly biased, cheapen the events they describe.  The events and the motives behind them are complicated, but the audience is treated as if there is some cartoon-simple means of grasping the subtleties and nuances that are invariably involved in real life.  This film is designed not to help us understand but to make us feel sorry for Israelis, and Jews in general, and guilty if we don't happen to belong within those social borders.  The film makers should have run The Sorrow and the Pity before assembling this.  These horrible murders and the frustrating developments that followed carry sufficient impact on their own that the lilly need not be gilded, or blackened, by editorial comments. Some people may mistake my views as criticisms of the Israelis, but that's not their intent.  I'm criticizing the film because it doesn't do enough honor to the people, Israelis and others as well, who were the victims in this atrocity.  I wonder if it would make any difference if I said I were Jewish.  To the extent that it would, it would illustrate the difference between being inside and outside the social border I referred to earlier.

It's supposed to be about the real event that I vaguely remember when I was a kid. It doesn't cover enough of the background information regarding the motives of the 'terrorists' (otherwise referred to as Arabs in Hollywood), or the German Government, or the Israeli Government. Also, for them to insist that the Olympics are meant to foster good relations between people from different countries, is ridiculous. It's competition between countries, that is truly intended to show superiority of certain nationalities over others. THE OLYMPICS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PEACE! That said, I also have to mention that the Rock music in the movie (which is music I Love) does not fit the scene. The innocent athlete's who get killed from this horrible event are not honored by the music. It just distracts from what happened and the possibilities of why it happened. The constant downgrading of Germany in the movie is disturbing also. The leaders of Germany were obviously not the only ones who wanted to continue the Olympic Games. There was, and is so darn much money that's at stake in advertising and other aspects of these global media events, that no matter what happens, they'll want to continue! As far as the 'terrorists' (or evil-doers, as our GWB would say) are concerned, they are made to look insane and evil near the end of the movie when the 3 survivors get interviewed. Slow motion can do that! This movie needs a lot of work. Israel was not created through peaceful events. Some information about that might explain things a little better. Nothing excuses terrorist events though. But people should realize that terrorist can sometimes be leaders of countries also. Hummm......world...police......????

I have rarely seen such a biased, simplistic and naive piece of work. There is no attempt whatsoever to put the tragic events in Munich into context. What the audience ends up with is a piece of all too obvious propaganda which leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and only succeeds in reducing your sympathy of all involved.There is clearly a three tier alternative agenda at play in this film; 1 ; To de-humanise and demonise the Palestinians involved in the Munich attack. There is no real attempt to explain the background or motivation for their actions. 2 ; To absolve the Israeli government of any of the blame, despite the fact that they refused to make even the slightest gesture to help their country's athletes. 3 ; To portray the Germans as not only incompetent (probably undisputed) but also as co-conspirators with the Palestinians.As you leave the cinema the viewer is left with an empty feeling and a desire to find out more about the real facts. While I'm not naive enough to expect all documentary makers to be unbiased, I certainly expect a more balanced view when reviewing such relatively recent events.What is even more upsetting is that through the usual connivances of the AMPAS voting panel, this film beat the wonderful Buena Vista Social Club as best documentary. Following on from the decision to ignore Hoop Dreams one can only wonder at how valid this particular award is.

The descriptions one can find on the IMDb for this film astound me. Things such as shows the Palestinians for what they are; happy to kill Israelis and shows the nature of good and evil. All of which is exactly what most people tend to do in situations such as these personalize and humanize the victims while demonizing the proponents.The film fills in backstory on the German government. Just enough back story, that is, to make one angry at the German government for being criminally negligent (despite the fact that this assumes they had any reason to suspect that such an event would take place at the Olympics). It also goes to great lengths to show the Palestinian celebration of the dead men upon their return home, but makes no effort to show what could drive men to such acts... Again, assuming the presence of evil, rather than a logical motive. And the film focuses its efforts on one victim and his widow; clumsily humanizing the story in a way which makes it even more ghastly, yet, as was previously mentioned, by the time the film reaches it's conclusion, we feel absolutely no remorse about the deaths of the terrorists.This is the kind of film that proposes eye for an eye in regards to terrorism, and inflames hatred of Arabs in the eyes of those who do not understand the motives and do not wish to.It is blame wrapped up in a convincing package. Using a human tragedy as ammunition to incite anger at the terrorists rather than intelligent reflection on the horror of the action.It is possible to loathe the action without seeing the perpetrators as inhuman... But you won't find it in this film.Shameful.  "}]
