[{"Title":"French history (and Isabelle Adjani) laid bare.","Date":"18 January 2004","Score":"55 out of 78 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Back in 1994 &#145;La Reine Margot' dispensed of every preconceived notion of traditional costume drama, bringing a radical and shocking slant on history. The lavish sets and costumes remained but the atmosphere was now tainted with bloodshed, poison, lust and incest. The regal palaces that were so stereotypically populated by loyal subjects are transformed into a viper's nest of power politics, schemes and deceit where royal heritage counts for little and deviousness is the key to success.The year is 1572; France is torn apart amidst the conflict between Catholics and Protestants whilst the King is a mere puppet, first to his domineering, Catholic, mother (Catherine de Medici, played with superlative coldness by Virna Lisi) and later to the protestant leader Coligny. In a half hearted effort to bring peace to the land Catherine marries off her daughter Margot (Isabelle Adjani) to the protestant Henri de Navarre (Daniel Auteuil), a political manoeuvre that deludes no one. Margot and Henri are certainly a less than content couple; as they walk down the aisle they engage in a hissing match with one another where Margot succinctly informs him that &#145;Just because we're married it doesn't mean I have to sleep with you' and suggests he steer clear of her bedroom. They also fail to adhere to any form of decorum during the wedding reception; whilst Henri brawls with the Catholics (and flirts with a very youthful Asia Argento, of xXx fame) Margot goes window shopping amongst the male guests, looking for a viable one night stand. When the wedding guests prove unsatisfactory she simply dons a mask and takes to the streets, masquerading as a prostitute, and continues her search amongst the hordes of Protestant soldiers, who have gathered for her wedding, eventually settling on the dour La Mole (Vincent Perez). However any illusions of peace are shattered after a botched attempt to assassinate Coligny, as the Catholics, fearing a revolt, slaughter 6,000 Protestants in what becomes known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre.  The sheer horror of the massacre is reproduced with unflinching realism by director Patrick Chireau, who manages not only to shock but also recreate an atmosphere of utter chaos, exemplified by the moment when Margot is wandering amongst the palace corridors which have been besieged by soldiers and are strewn with corpses (Margot is curtly told &#145;return to your room and lock the door'). Unfortunately some of the impact of the massacre is lost due to the fact that we know barely any of the characters who are being murdered and it begs credibility that the Protestants seemingly put up no resistance.    One of the few survivors of the slaughter is La Mole, who is saved by Margot when he breaks into her chamber, looking for sanctuary, which Margot freely gives to him (and more). In the aftermath of the massacre Margot also manages to save Henri de Navarre, forging a valuable alliance in the process. However, suspicion has been aroused that she is a traitor and she finds that she is in a decidedly vulnerable position where her only hope of freedom is to flee to Navarre with Henri.Isabelle Adjani, France's premier actress, delivers one of her finest performances as the stubborn and promiscuous Margot, who despite initially coming across as vain and conceited later earns our sympathy as she finds herself in an impossible situation, where her position in the royal family is of little consequence (her brothers love her in a perversely incestuous way and her mother sees her as an inconvenience and potential threat to her authority) and the threat of assassination always looms around the corner. Whilst the political manoeuvrings and power struggles are intriguing the same cannot be said for the tepid romance between Adjani and Perez. The pair lacks any chemistry; even their scenes of erotic passion come across as frigid and awkward. They make an attractive couple, but not a particularly convincing one.La Reine Margot is also one of the most visually sumptuous films ever released; the big budget clearly didn't go to waste in recreating the gothic decadence of the period and the costumes were deservingly nominated for an Oscar. It's easy to view &#145;La Reine Margot' as a precursor to the acclaimed 1998 film &#145;Elizabeth', as both centre around a female historical figure who has to endure the conflict between Catholics and Protestants whilst surviving assassination attempts (usually via poison) and overcome tragedy as those who they care for are systematically murdered. Indeed if nothing else &#145;La Reine Margot' provides a chilling insight into one of history's most horrific atrocities and offers an unsettling portrait of the moral bankruptcy that pervaded throughout 16th century society.My Score 8 out of 10   	             "},{"Title":"Prestige Cinema","Date":"19 December 1998","Score":"50 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Alexandre Dumas should certainly be satisfied with this superb adaptation of his classic.

The horrendous scenes of the murders in all their crudity are terrific. The actors did a wonderful job here.  Isabelle Adjani is, as usual, terrific. Her nude scenes, depicting the queen's adultery, lust and incestuous affairs are acted in such a way that they are a form of art. Vincent Perez is in one of his best roles - his interpretation of La Môle is second only to his acting in Indochine.   The great Virna Lisi is simply marvellous posing as Cathérine de Médicis - no wonder she won the Best Actress Award at Cannes. She is the ambitious woman par excellence, stopping at nothing to get where she wants, not even if she has to see her sons being killed one by one and sell her daughter in a convenient marriage to unite the Catholics and the Protestants.  The others, especially Asia Argento, impersonating the tragic countess Charlotte de Sauve  did a good job too.  A very well deserved Prix du Jury.

This is a stunning tale of 16th century sex and violence, with a dirty realism, but still an overlay of beauty.Isabelle Adjani is intense, beautiful, and sensuous as Margot, the highly sexed, intelligent and dutiful sister of the doomed King Charles IX of France. She is forced into a marriage of political and religious convenience by her bitterly ambitious mother, Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi) to the repulsive Henri Navarre (sympathetically played by Daniel Auteuil). There is a tremendous amount going on, and Margot's incest with her brothers is more than hinted at.The searingly sensual Vincent Perez plays La Mole, who eventually becomes Margot's doomed lover. Their first encounter is an acrobatic feat of anonymous sex in an alleyway that is breath-taking. Their later love scenes are intensely erotic. This film only becomes better on repeat viewings. I found I was able to grasp more on my second viewing. There is so much going on, so many twists and turns and shocks, and the film is also quite long. It never lags, and even Margot's grudging tolerance, if not love, for her husband, is believingly portrayed. Very highly recommended.

A great part of the romance or charm about French movies comes from the fact that they are actually spoken in French. Nobody in these films expects the rest of the world to understand as they speak but to make a little effort and appreciate the beauty in each language is something I think is missing in American culture. I've seen nothing but comments on how difficult it was for some members of the American public to understand this film. I only ask myself in times of globalization, isn't it interesting to learn from people from other parts of the world in their own language, specially a French film based on a French novel by the French Alexandre Dumas, placed in the 16th century, directed by one of France's best directors and acted by some of the most wonderful French actors and actresses of the last decades?

The story itself is adapted from Alexandre Dumas' novel, which is a pretty highly colored piece to begin with. Chereau theatrically plasters the set with blood and gore, and we are left in no doubt that an atrocity has occurred (the St Bartholomew's day massacre of the Hugenots.) The mendacious Queen Mother, Catherine di Medici, and her weak-minded son, Charles IX, seem to have set it off to deal with the protestant problem without realizing how bad it might get.In all this horror is the rather cute tale of the relationship between two disparate personalities thrown together in marriage, Catherine's daughter Margo and Henry of Navarre (later Henry IV of France, and one of its better kings). Margo is repulsed at first sight by Henry `the peasant' while Henry rightly regards her as about as loving as a trapped tiger. Yet they reach an accommodation and finish up friends. Both have other lovers (and both respect that) but neither can prevent the lovers from coming to sticky ends.It's always a bit hard to assess the acting when you are relying on sub-titles (if only the French didn't speak so fast) but Isabella Adjani at the age of 40 pulled off a remarkable job and had me convinced she really was a spoilt, willful little nymphomaniac in her early 20's. She looked as young as she did in the `Story of Adele H' 20 years earlier. Daniel Auteuil was also excellent as the unprepossessing but very intense and quick-thinking Henry. Virna Lisi, a sex symbol in her earlier film career, made a good villainess as Catherine. Most of the other principals seem to have been chosen for their looks by rent-an-ego casting though Jean-Huges Anglade was suitably pathetic as the doomed King Charles.The rather claustrophobic sets brought home the medieval lack of privacy, even (perhaps especially) in royal palaces &#150; the old Louvre was about as spacious as the &#145;loo. The film fades a bit in the second half, but it's still not a bad story, if at times a bit difficult to follow.  I have to say I found `Elizabeth' more interesting and a lot less bloody. Anyway, `Margo' is very French, and not to be judged by Hollywood standards (whatever they are).

Queen Margot (Adjani) is at the center of this maelstrom of wickedness and treachery which looks at everything from poison lip rouge to a bloody holocaust.  An elaborate award winning production, Queen Margot presents its history realistically with no clear sense of good or evil - unlike Braveheart, for example - with countless extras, spectacular costuming, and artistry in cinematography. Well worth its 2.5 hour run, this dark film, based on the novel by A. Dumas, is lacking in the didactic and will be difficult to follow for all but those with historical knowledge of the place and time. A little research prior to watching the film can go a long way toward understanding the complexities of the story.

Like many others I've always been fascinated by this episode in French history, a turbulent and savagely intolerant period and not only in France, but 1572 is yet another year that went down in infamy. This film portrays the complicated machinations performed by Catherine de Medici and her cohorts in furthering her Catholic ambitions for her country and debauched family against the perceived threat of dour Protestantism, and centred around the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre.It's the rather beautiful Isabelle Adjani's stunning performance as Queen Margot that can leave you as breathless as she often is in the film, without her it would have been a much poorer film. She seemed to live the part, with every emotion imaginable on display. Would French breathlessness, or those huge rustling dresses sound as good dubbed into English?! On the other hand the rest of the cast are superb in their roles too, but especially Daniel Auteuil as Henri de Navarre and Jean Hugues Anglade as Charles IX, making them both extremely believable sympathetic characters when they weren't. The bloodbath and the anarchy of the Massacre and aftermath is vividly presented &#150; we are not spared a single thing in the entire film, all manner of violence and depravity is non-gratuitously displayed. It's impossible to convey a part of what happens in this film &#150; the same as it must have been impossible for the film to convey a fraction of what happened in that era too it really is a must-see. I've seen it a number of times now since 1994 and I find something new I hadn't spotted before every time. It's a film that can make you realise (if you didn't before) that millions of ordinary folk all around the world could and still can believe in such arrant religious nonsense to the point of committing multiple ghastly murders in the name of empty air.Apart from all that, it's a beautifully crafted film, the best of its kind there's ever been.

But, a VERY important part of French and European history nonetheless. The history teacher in me will now BRIEFLY take over Like England, there was a lot of tension between the Protestants (Hugenots) and Catholics during the 16th century. However, unlike Henry VIII's ultimate decision to break from the Catholic Church, the French pretty much wiped out the Hugenots--those who were not killed fled abroad. Up until St. Bart's Day, there had been tension but eventually the king granted religious freedom to all. This was not to last, as a conspiracy was hatched and on St. Bart's Day, thousands of Hugenots were murdered. To commemorate this event, the Pope issued a special medallion and ordered a celebration. Not exactly one of the finer moments in human history.The movie concerns the machinations leading up to the event as well as portraying the massacre and the after effects. I'm not going to say more, as I don't want to spoil it for the viewer. However, I will say that the writing, acting and pacing of this film were excellent and kept my attention throughout.

Dumas must be dancing in his grave ! When I see IMDb critics saying that this is a great artistic movie, I wonder if people saw the same movie I did...Topmost, I find it inadmissible that Chereau permits himself to rewrite such a masterpiece written by one of France's most beloved writers, as if what Dumas wrote wasn't good enough to make a decent movie. It is a common flaw in movie making to change the story pretexting that the original material isn't suited for screen play.A few examples  the St Barthelemy night which we have to endure for a long 15 or more minutes in the movie merely takes one page on the 600 of the book...As for the friendship between La Mole and Coconnas ( who are amongst the most interesting characters of the book ) which is at the center of the original material, it is largely omitted in the movie and furthermore is totally incoherent  after fighting to the death and being quite unknown to each other, the fall in each other's arms in one ridiculous scene that had me laugh because it was so bad.Anyways, all this is bad french cinema making, the kind which we would like to stop seeing.

This one is excellently done, in it's acting, sumptuous sets, costumes, lively pace and adventure and occasional high violence. It's also sensually smoking, with the gorgeous and intensely passionate and feminine Adjani holding nothing back. She even manages at twice the age to look almost young enough to play 19 year old Margot at her wedding.It's a fairly easy film to enjoy if you don't worry too much about the plot turns and detailed historical machinations, and even more rewarding to watch several times or more seriously, especially if you do some background reading at Wikipedia or elsewhere.Its historical accuracy is however a decidedly mixed picture. The sense of 16th century French court life, the major historical events including the massacre, and almost all the major figures are quite accurately portrayed. Even such figures as the Protestant Admiral Coligny and Guise, Margot's principal lover at the time of her arranged marriage, are accurately portrayed. De la Mole seems to be either wholly or largely invented, but it's common for more wholly personal charters to be in historical fiction and that's generally fine with me. So too is it here, except in essence it portrays him as the love of her life &#150; whereas she doesn't seem to really have had one.The film though seeks not merely to view Queen Margot and her voluminous affairs sympathetically, but to entirely lionize her for invented reasons. Given that she's the principal character in the film and not a trivial historical figure, that's not unimportant. While not hiding the fact that she never loved her husband and had many lovers, it did soft peddle her pronounced and highly indiscrete promiscuity, and largely invented both her sisterly loyalty to her husband, and tolerant and humanitarian heroic acts on behalf of him and the Protestant Huguenots more generally.Following Dumas it seeks to portray her as a woman who loyally and enduringly loved a man through thick and thin, just not the man she was forced to marry, but instead the minor Huguenot la Mole. In fact Margot's relationships seemed to have been if often passionate, also often simultaneous, overlapping, in quick succession, and not especially marked by enduring loyalty. If the contemporary portraits at Wikipedia can be believed, she while attractive was also not the transcendent beauty that is Adjani, though I hardly complain that Adjani was chosen. I'm not condemning Margot's sexual voraciousness but I am saying that the whitewashed, false and sanitized view of it here is rather in the nature of propaganda or myth. At one point for example la Mole says she's been fated to have lovers who die off on her, which seems to have had little basis.It was not unaccepted at the time for queens or female aristocrats in passionless arranged marriages to have lovers, but they were generally supposed to do so discretely, in a way that did not bring ridicule or dishonor to their husband, if honorable. Husbands too, though admittedly more universally tolerated in having affairs, were supposed to honor their wives. Both were also expected to try for some sort of marital love or at least a kind of intimate respect, and to attempt to produce legitimate heirs. Queen Margot seems to have never done any of this, or certainly not much. Most unreformed male libertines who accomplish little aren't so loved either.It's not clear she ever accomplished much, including having any children, not to mention any heir to the French throne &#150; which she could have done (unless as seems likely she was, or became, barren - STD's?).More important though is the way the film seeks to portray Margot as a heroine to the persecuted Huguenots, not because she believed in their religious cause, but because she was a firm believer in tolerance and humanitarianism, or became both after witnessing the massacre. Both were true of her husband Henri, who acted upon them especially after becoming the Good King Henri of France, but I see little evidence they were of Margot. Instead I strongly suspect she was lionized by Alexandre Dumas, and likely by earlier Huguenot tales, traditions and perhaps lesser novels, in aide of gallantry, the Huguenot and liberal cause and their integration into French national affection. (There was after all, they said, at least one good French royal at the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre.) This seems built largely on Queen Margot's being the one member of the French royal family who wasn't intent on persecuting the Huguenots, since her interests were rather elsewhere than religion, politics or idealism.As well her close personal, sisterly, relationship with her husband seems to be almost or entirely invented by Dumas, in service of our sympathy for her. Instead Henri several times provided sanctuary to her when she had nowhere else to go, despite their at best strained and tempestuous and thereafter icy relationship. Henri did not in fact seek to bring Margot to Navarre with him when he fled Paris nor did she want to go, with or without her lover(s). Instead several years later she partly fled there from her brother King Henry III of France (who takes power as the film ends) and was partly banished due to her increasingly scandalous and heedless behavior. Again much later, when she had long been divorced from Henri and grown old, isolated and nearly penniless, in an act which speaks much more about Henri's character than their relationship, Henri brought her back to the French court, where she eventually had some role in helping care for his children by his second wife. I've also seen no evidence she helped Henri escape to Navarre or before that convinced him to convert to Catholicism to save his life.I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot, but little reason to view her as a heroine.

I liked, however, that they used the color red as the main theme, since the focus was on the St. Bartholomew day Massacre.  That scene was a bit long, and the gore was at times unnecessary, but it showed the horror that the Protestants underwent that night.  Isabelle Adjani and Virna Lisi were very good in their roles as was Vincent Perez.  One thing I found fascinating was that the gentleman who played Henry de Navarre looked exactly like the real Henry of Navarre as seen in paintings done during his life.

One would like to speak to the filmmaking here, and along the way, on the movie.If one is at all interested in French history, one has already seen this movie a thousand* times, * meaning enough. However, a digital dvd transfer of the movie as it was originally intended to be seen by M. Chéreau, without subtitles, without interference,the VO version originale is stunning. The first and foremost difference is the lighting - il te frappe, as the French would say, it strikes you. Not being a technician, one can't speak to the difference between the film one saw on DVD and the film one saw in American theaters, or on American DVD, or even on VHS, French and/or American. The difference is striking. From the opening scenes, one is suddenly, almost frightfully, drawn into the 16th century, an epoch without the cushions of modern life. The light is everywhere, and it shines in a way that is pitiless and revelatory. This was never, unfortunately, appparent to theater goers here, and, I suspect, to cinema goers in France. If it had been, there would have been Oscars. One is not sure cinema projection equipment can convey what M. Chéreau did with this film. Where there is light, there is liminality and where there are shadows, even there there is light, but it is dim (thus not liminal), and the cadaverous flesh of the living players conveys more than anyone could ever say in dialogue - these are dead people, living out a drama that is already predestined for them, which is a marvelously conceived conceit of the filmmaker. M. Chéreau is playing with predestination and Fate here, and it is through the art of cinema that he is doing it. Mlle Adjani turns in a bravura performance, and it is only by grace of Jeanne Moreau's 1954 performance that we have any scale of comparison. Moreau's performance is cool, ice and politics, but Adjani's is heat, love and politics, and suited to her generation. Vincent Perez is suitably heroic (watch the rose tones come and go on his flesh as the light changes). The kudos for male performances, however, are shared by Jean-Hugues Anglade, long an underrated French actor, and Daniel Auteuil, too long appreciated for his bravura performances elsewhere and not given enough credit for what he can do with a gesture, with a line, with a look. M. Auteuil is almost always lit with cool hypocrisy, (ambers and greens) as suits his performance, but M. Anglade turns in one of the best roles of his career as the doomed Charles IX, and he never looks less than on death's door. A naturally sensitive actor, he adds a touch of soullessness to his Charles IX that is unforgettable - weak, yes, king, yes, momma's boy, yes, but also, in the end, needy child. It is stunning in its ultimate simplicity as a performance for cinema. Very few performances in film measure up to Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medici(s) the s is French spelling. She is incroyable (incredible), and something was wrong when she wasn't recognized universally as '94's best supporting actress. Her queen is multi-layered, loving, hating, deeply cynical yet naively superstitious, playing son against son and daughter against political reality, in other words a perfect incarnation of the 16th century in France. Any political woman you can think of could have sat at her feet and learned lessons on how to do it. Mme Lisi herself might have been a confidante to the real Catherine, she is that good in this role. She was crowned for this performance in Europe, but should have been crowned universally. Watch her as she vacillates between love and hate and politics, and especially watch the lighting - it subtly changes according to her role of the moment. Watch her carefully towards the end, as Fate winds things up, and watch an actress give herself up totally to the role, to the moment, in order to incarnate a character that is absolutely unforgettable.Apparently, M. Chéreau lets his actors know what he is doing, because they respond in according  shades of emotion. When the lighting is dim, or the focus is midrange, they fuzz a little, giving the viewer a sense of their uncertainty, but if he focuses, they focus, too, and there are frightening moments of soul-baring intimacy when you almost want to look away - it is like watching your intimates make love; too much, too intimate, too deep. Dominique Blanc turns in a nearly flawless performance as the over-the-top lady-in-waiting to Margot - watch her lighting, too, and how she responds. Conspiratrice, duchesse, cynical woman in love despite herself, she is very, very good. Pascal Greggory as the future Henri III is wonderful, and the rest of the cast stand out. This was obviously a labor of love and intensity, and all gave their best to M. Chéreau.In the end, one keeps wondering what it is about the film that was so memorable - and the french dvd transfer makes it perfectly clear. The performances, yes; the mise en scène, yes; the director, certainly. But it is the whole, the light and the shadows, the darkness and the glow, as in those candles in the marvelous square paper lanterns in the late night of the Louvre as the people begin to weave their plots, that make it memorable. Good actors, great performances, and a sure director - flawless cinema.

It's drenched in blood (people actually sweat blood in this movie) and animated by extraordinary music. In its romantic fire the film is unapologetically, almost satirically, French.If sumptuous spectacle done with tremendous craft is your bag, then this thing is a monster of a flick.

I was pleasantly surprised. The film follows the book a bit loosely, and maybe that was a good thing; too many times copying a book faithfully makes a film lose focus and artistic/dramatic impact. La Reine Margot is played by a great team of actors that turned in excellent performances. Daniel Auteuil, as Henry de Navarre is superb as usual, in his depiction of an intelligent king caught in the middle of the deadly politics of a religious war; Isabelle Adjani is perfect for the title role, so is Vincent Perez as La Mole, and the rest of the cast is just as wonderful, except I thought Virna Lisi was a bit too melodramatic in depicting the evilness of Catherine de Medici and I found the film's suggestion that there were some sort of incestuous relations between Catherine and her sons sensationalist, unfounded and a bit slimy for a film of this caliber). The costumes seem as sumptuous as French royals would wear in those times, without looking overdone; the decors and extras appear as real as if filmed in a time warp - dirt, mess and all; they are carefully done, yet without an over-manicured look; all this conferred the film an air of authenticity instead of just making it look too perfectly staged. The violence of the St. Bartholomew massacre looks quite realistic and non-glamorized, which apparently turned off many viewers. Hmmm... give us violence, but don't let us feel bad about it.The story is loosely based on historical truth, but is close enough to it. Apparently, Margot was indeed a victim of the politics of the time, and the whole business of her saving Henry de Navarre from assassination and helping him gain political momentum is historically true. Although she divorced him later and he remarried, they remained in friendly terms. The love affair with La Mole might just as well be true too, considering that Margot had a many lovers, not surprisingly, since all other aspects of her life were controlled or repressed by others... I was a bit sorry to see Catherine de Medicis portrayed so unidimensionally as the vicious, bloodthirsty queen mother. Her methods were not excusable, but considering the times, they were the typical diplomatic tools employed by everyone. Although Italian and married to Henry II against her will, she loved France and embraced her resposiblities as its queen, and her purpose was, besides keeping the House of Valois on the throne, to save the country from a civil war that would have exposed it to invasion by Spain and England. OK, back to the film I thought it was great, with excellent dialogue, well crafted scenes, good suspense, the romance is not corny, yet dramatic enough. Historically accurate or not, it gives one a glimpse of how love, life and the politics of those times must have been. Lovely to watch.

Vincent Perez was perfect as the suave handsome lover of Margot, and so were the rest of the cast which include the kings and future kings on both sides.The story didn't have a strong outline and was rather weak but overall the acting pulled it off. There was much gore with swords slashing and piercing through human flesh, bodies all piled up along the streets and blood was seen streaming out from cut wounds freely. There was a scene when a man's neck was slashed and the flesh just tore apart revealing everything inside with blood splattered all over. Nude bodies are a free sight in this film and we get to see heads that are detached from the carcasses. No wonder this movie was banned here in Asia and got an R rating for US audience. It's amazing that Spain rated this film at 13 as i seriously doubt this movie should even be suitable to be watched by kids of age 15 and below.Did I mention this movie got a lot of nudes on offer? Yes, we get to see both Vincent and Isabelle baring it all too in the show, especially the former. And I really mean ALL. Kudos to Vincent who really have the guts to bare it all in two separate scenes.

The princess Marguerite is remembered mostly for her life of dedicated whoring right up until her death. However, three of the characters are masterfully depicted Henri IV (Auteuil) Catherine de Medici (Lisi) and Charles IX (Anglade), who account for most of the film's veracity. A more accurate portrayal of Henri III who for a time occupied the client throne of Poland in a travesty more like its Queen than its King, would have been welcome. Only a very slight hint of this is given when he is shown kissing his mignon (a bit part played by Thomas Kretschmann, who has lately developed into an impressive actor.) It might also have been interesting seeing the attempt to capture the throne of England by sending the youngest, Duke D'Alencon, to woo Elizabeth I. For a better understanding of Catherine de Medici's character, her youthful life as the scorned and betrayed Italian queen of Henri II is portrayed by Marisa Pavan in the 1956 film Diane and the early part of her Regency and the prophecy concerning her children's dire fates in the 1994 film Nostrodamus in which she is played by Amanda Plummer. The parallels with her troubled reign and that of her contemporary Elizabeth of England are many. Elizabeth had the Babington plot to deal with and (all the usual glorification of her aside) had many Catholics executed and the remaining Catholic nobility taxed into eventual penury. Not to mention the terrible persecutions she visited (like her predecessors) on Scotland and Ireland. So don't be too quick to judge Catherine de Medici as a monster. Expediency made both of these women ruthless but successful monarchs in very adverse situations. Despite some inaccuracies, this film has a genuine feel for the period that should be greatly appreciated by historical cognoscenti.

Too many characters, and the short textual introduction at the beginning cannot be enough to enable the average viewer to follow the plot. They are so many that it is impossible to provide adequate background so that to characterise the characters is impossible. So, ruled out a sort of psychological drama, only an action-like fight-and-blood option is left, and though, to make this work, you should at least be able to group the characters in good ones and bad ones!

If our rulers today were expected to prove their prowess by fighting large fierce mammals, politics would look rather different.The film portrays an extremely important episode in French and European history, a major step towards the establishment of Absolutism which then led to its own downfall in the Revolution. However the major political developments are left in the background. I was barely able to sketch them in with my own vague knowledge of the time, so this film might be a bit difficult to understand with no background knowledge at all. Hopefully this will stimulate viewers to find out more! There is prominent sexual content in this film. In my opinion it was neither excessive nor gratuitous. Sexuality was an important part of feudal court politics, and the emotional content of all the sex scenes forms an integral part of the portrayal of the characters' complex and conflicting motivations.There is also explicit violence. Again, this is integral to the development of the plot, characters and atmosphere. Perpetrators of the massacre are shown to be traumatised by what they have done and seen.This is an ambitious film, skilfully made, whose greatest strength is a vivid expression of an interesting theory about the nature of society in the time in which it is set.

The movie has also crude scenes with  lot of gore. Most of the cast is incredible Isabelle Adjani is maybe one of the most beautiful women that I´ve seen in the screen. Because her mysterious and ethereal beauty you could believe that is the 19 year princess. But maybe this time was too ethereal. There were four amazing performances by Virna Lissi excellent as the powerful regent Catherine of Medicis (I would not like to being his child), Jean Hughes Anglade as the king of france, Daniel Autiel as Navarre and The strange beauty of Dominique Blanc. Also there were good Vincent Peres, Asia Argento, and the guy that plays Henri Valois "},{"Title":"A woman betrayed by her family, her husband one who was too frightened, a lover who wanted to see her light shine in virtue, and the disturbing sight of a slaughter.. all within the confines of a Royal famil","Date":"19 May 1999","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama","Review":"  A wonderful French film, filled with the seduction, passion, anger, rage, and bitter sweet irony that filled life in the period.  Vincent Perez was just marvelous, this movie was the first time I saw his talents, and have been a fan of his since. Isabelle Adjani was just as fantastic, I was so transfixed on her character, and the problems that rose up around her because of her brilliant acting. Jean-Hugues Anglade was so.. good, so.. terrifying as Charles, making me cringe at times, and feel a deep sympathy for his character other times. The cast was truly brilliant.  Its a movie I can't get enough of.

As History is most definitely not one of my strong points, such are the wonders of Internet that I put a few names from the film in the search engine and found quite a few interesting facts on this bloody massacre, many of which are mentioned in the film. The events are also touched upon by Stendhal in his novel `Rouge et Negre' (1830). Excellent photography portraying the dark events and conspirations in the palace and streets of Paris, and the main actors were worthy of their rôles. Nice to see Virna Lisi, of course, and once again our intrepid Claudio Amendola (Nostromo, qv); the sensual Isabelle Adjani made a superb Reine Margot; but it was those deep dark eyes of the frightfully beautiful Asia Argento that had me sighing again&#133;&#133;.. Daniel Auteuil was good, but I had him too present in my mind from `Le Huitième Jour' (qv), that brilliant, inspired gem directed by Jaco van Dormael.I had not heard of this book by Dumas, such is my ignorance. Years ago I enjoyed the incomparable `Le Comte de Montecristo' and recently have seen a TV film based on it, starring &#150; you would never guess! &#150; Gérard Depardieu, as well as the heart-stopping Asia Argento.As coincidence will have it, I made my début on the night of Saint Bartholomew &#150; 373 years later.

It gives us a feel for how terrible the wars of religion were and how much hatred existed between Catholic and Protestant - and we think we're fighting a Holy war now???The cast are all excellent without exception - especially Anglade and Autiel. The film is sumptuous and colourful and also highly erotic. It plays with its audience lurching between lust and slaughter.The script is excellent - but sadly the subtitlers as usual give us English ideas of what is said - not literal translation which would be far more poetic.Ultimately this film is a lesson to Hollywood on the art of film making. History is peppered with scripts - write proper scripts from proper stories - make them truthful and authentic by using proper actors from the countries concerned - or at least actors that can do the accent.If the US struggles for History why not plunder Europe?This film is in my Top 20.

Best Love story ever and best historical film of all time etc. Utterly bored and perplexed I turned it off half way through. Who the hell was who ? What was going on ? Not being conversant with the period I found it incomprehensible. Why did all the nobles and royalty dress like vagabonds? Why were they so dirty, given that they had enough money to be able to wash ? The box art had even given away the ending. i.e a bloodbath, so there wasn't even any suspense as to regards what would happen at the end. All the characters were so unsympathetic and pointless that they deserved to die. Who could care about them ? Best Emporer's New Clothes Film of all time would be a better appellation.

Aside from the costumes and beautiful people (some). This movie is a great movie. It really shows the tension between the Catholics and the Protestant back in France. It also shows how violent this gets. King Henry(Protestant) and Queen Margot (Catholic) get married in hopes for peace between these two disputing parties. However, this does nothing to aid and hopes for peace. Instead poor King Henry is stuck in a castle full of Catholics who life motto seems to be Fi Fy Foe Fum I smell the blood of a Protestant! So this poor guy is constantly watching his back because he knows people want to kill him. i really felt sorry for this guy.There is a lot of blood shed and mostly done by the Catholics side, whereas none by the Protestant. But everyone know that there was violence done by the Protestant to the Catholics? I would have like it if this film showed both sides of wrong doing. It's a little bias. What else, there is sexuality in this film, funny due to the fact that the Queen wont give poor ugly Henry some good lovin. Margot is also portrayed in a more liberated light, considering the time it was. However, I don't know how much this is true, There are good steamy scenes though, however, these don't pervert the film at all. In fact there are a few of these, 0and there is good french nudity, from both genders, finally!!This film does attempt to develop it characters, but it does fall short in this.I don't think i'll watch this film again, unless i'm bored. It's not a sleeper though.

It doesn't exactly follow the book too closely but the fine direction more than enough makes up for it. The sex scenes were more erotic than porn and somehow appeared necessary to portray the bond between Queen Margot and La Mole. Maybe I'm weird but this is the movie to make me cry. Isabelle Adjani clearly deserved her Cesar award (too bad she couldn't accept it in person) and her somber features fitted the persona of the seductive confused queen. I recommend this to everyone to watch if you want a fine piece of foreign film to watch.  "}]
