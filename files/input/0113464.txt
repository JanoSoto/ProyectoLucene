I had meant to watch it for years, but it was a gay film, a genre which I love, but often eschew because these films always make me think--even La Cage aux Folles had a deep and abiding lesson or two hidden inside.) The themes often involve intolerance, and the traumatic impact of AIDS on the entire gay community; even if the film is a comedy, I find these themes fill me with empathic pain and frustration. I decided to brave those themes despite my female tear ducts this evening, and I was glad I did.This film was silly. This film was witty. The dialogue is sparkling. All those things made it wonderful to watch. The characters we meet are intriguing, and though the 2-dimensional stereotypes are made for laughs, we get the feeling that we are laughing at the strange mix of truth and falsehood many of the stereotypes possess; we are laughing not at people who are flaming but at characters who are exuberant, joyous people, trying to squeeze every bit of joy and delight that they can out of every moment.I won't spoil the journey through this story with any specifics, let's just say that Jeffrey doesn't quite get it. It is both painful and joyful at turns watching the character navigate through a turning point in his life. I laughed, I got choked up, and then I laughed again, and again ad infinitum. This is not a gay movie. It's a character driven story that we can all identify with, if our minds and hearts are open.

It's especially funny (and biting on occasion) if you happened to have lived through the first rush of AIDS deaths and the fear that engendered. This whole movie is a send up of that, and revels in the idea that sex and life go on even in the aftermath of terror. The Hoe-down fantasy sequence with its overtones of Busby Berkley and Oklahoma is hysterically funny. As for the acting, it's purposely broad with Patrick Steward playing against type, both in his role of Picard and in his many Shakespearean ones. Steve Weber is a hoot and there is no doubt in my mind that the other actors had a blast working in this flick. Many of them appear to have that look you see when actors are performing for their peers and enjoying every moment of it. The Pink Panthers moment alone lets Stewart shine. Are there flaws in the movie. Yup! The dialogue is sometimes stilted and jokes occasionally are dumped in rather than flowing from the plot, but overall it's witty, biting, and downright rapier-like on more than one occasion. All in all, Jeffrey is fun and worth an hour or so of your life.

Any comedy that can make us cry at the death of a Broadway extra from Cats (the poor much maligned Cats) but have us laughing at the one man's desire that he feels he can't have, gives us a depth of meaning not seen in comedic film in quite a while. We've become to dependent on having comedies without a meaning, or a point, or a way of laughing at something as terrifying as the AIDS crisis.

Jeffrey is a gay man in New York City who suddenly decides to stop having sex. His plan goes well until he meets a gorgeous man in the gym that he can't stop thinking about. The more he tries to maintain a sex-free lifestyle, the more he thinks about this man. His feelings for the man is complicated when it it revealed to Jeffrey that the man is HIV+. It's as smart as an ironic romantic comedy can be and as funny as a movie about life can be. Personally I think that Patrick Stewart was directed to be far to gay than he needs to be (Not all gay men are limp-wristed, Patrick.) and the world doesn't need another gay priest joke, but you can't take this movie to seriously.

Even so, a movie has to be made, and men like the title character -- Jeffrey (Steven Weber, looking at ease in a part that gives him one note, that is, to look and be lost and drowning in self-pity) -- do exist (I have known several and the only thing to do is to run the opposite direction and never look back in case one turns into a pillar of salt) and their drama, or lack thereof, is the stuff that could induce anyone to plant a bullet through their temples to be done with the pain.Now, let's see. Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams (Michael T. Weiss, oozing dark masculinity). The catch this Man is HIV-positive. So the dilemma lies to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease (and risk his own life, since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death) or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar, even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking.The premise makes for a a story that should be much, much darker and introspective, but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy, and it works for the most part. Again, and going back to the top of this article, it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents, who are extremely, implausibly, hilariously in tune with the times (when in fact they shouldn't) and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's (lack of a) sex life. Looking at them, all 1950s excess, yammering in gay lingo, is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor.Other scenes are of equal hilarity Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon (as a reporter) announcing the sex change of a bit player (then unknown Gregory Ibarra) whose mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a whale of a time posing for cameras, and Nathan Lane as a priest who (unsuccessfully) tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast, however, Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover, also dying of AIDS, and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course, any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote, especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene. One of the better entries of the Nineties not to feature gay men as unable to have sex lives and wallowing in corners, and a hoot to watch.

For handsome Steve Weber, frustration with his sex life and lack of a romantic life, his decision to concentrate only on working out is stalled with a handsome spotter (Michael Weiss) who happens to be HIV positive. This at first isn't an obstacle for the somewhat neurotic Weber but when it comes to making it to their first date, he can't bring himself to go there. So what does Weiss do? Call him up and ball him out? No. Go to a bar and drink to forget? No. He cries a little, dances around the room to get over his hurt, but then picks himself up, dusts himself off, and starts all over again. But like Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli in Arthur, Weber and Weiss get caught between the moon and New York City, and thanks to some very understanding friends (among them, acerbic Patrick Stewart), come to terms with their differences, all with humor and tears, and only a bit of pathos.Gay camp humor is abound here as you have Sigourney Weaver as a self-help guru (she can spot a homosexual and a heavy-set woman with low-self esteem immediately in her audience), Christine Baranski as a socialite hosting a Hoe-down for AIDS, Olympia Dukakis as the mother of a transsexual lesbian (shades of her character from Tales From the City) and Nathan Lane as a show-tune singing priest. Stewart offers both bitchy humor (Does this scarf make me look like some gay super hero?) and wise father-like advice as he deals with his own crisis (his dying lover, a chorus boy from Cats who shocks Stewart by revealing he has no idea who Ann Miller is!), while a cigarette smoking Mother Theresa look-alike keeps popping in and out. There's wonderful sights of New York's Greewich and West Village (Sheraton Square and Washington Square) and a disturbing gay bashing scene (where one of them appears to be hiding his own sexuality), plus a starry finale that might appear over the top and unrealistic, but certainly every romantic gay man's fantasy. So this isn't a picture perfect adaption of a hit Broadway play, but it is totally entertaining and fast moving, one that may satisfy more for its moments than its total structure. The acting is first rate, although some of the performances are often characteratures rather than fleshed out individuals. This makes it a bit sitcomish in spots, but in the case of this film, that is not an obstacle to enjoying it, only a minor snafu.

So, what happens when, in the face of the AIDS tragedy, one handsome, young gay man decides that he'd rather be celibate than risk it all? Worse yet, what happens when he then meets the man of his dreams who turns out to be HIV positive? Rent this little gem to find out.Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a handsome, young, single gay man in New York City, who is letting his fear of AIDS run his life. In fact, he is so afraid of AIDS that he has decided that celibacy is the only way to protect himself from it. And considering the kinds of sexual encounters we see him engaged in during the opening sequence of the film, that may not be such a bad idea. His closest friends, Sterling (Patrick Stewart), a wise old decorator, and his partner, Darius (Bryan Batta), a dancer in the musical Cats, don't necessarily agree with Jeffrey, but they remain supportive. And then one day at the gym, Jeffrey meets trainer, Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), a very handsome man who is very interested in Jeffrey. After agonizing over the decision, Jeffrey agrees to go out with Steve, but before their first date, Steve tells Jeffrey that he is HIV positive, and Jeffrey cancels. As the movie goes on, Jeffrey experiences several life changing events which cause him to question the wisdom of his insistence on celibacy, and to wonder if a life without risks is a life worth living.It's rather a delightful script, full of wit and silliness, and flights of fancy. But underneath it all, there is a seriousness to the message, which only makes the comedy that much funnier. And its message about taking risks in life is one that should resonate universally.The acting was superb. Batt's uneducated, kept dancer is nicely done, in that we see that he's not stupid, he's just not sophisticated. Stewart camps it up with hilarious results, and yet his serious scenes show just how much range and talent this fine actor has. Weiss gives a nice performance as a man with a confident exterior who is still quite vulnerable underneath. Weber plays Jeffrey's uncertainty very well, and is surprisingly good as a gay man.Fun little film that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but which still has a serious message.

He decides to work out instead. Meeting Mr. Exactly Right in the gym gives him pause, though. Especially when the guy is the delectable Steve (Michael T.Weiss), all muscle and chiseled grin. Jeffrey's friends advise him to reconsider his celibacy, and give it a go. It takes Jeffrey around 1 hour and 20 minutes of screen-time to do so.

There is a sitcom-like feel to this story; obstructions and cracks are neatly wall-papered over in the name of light-hearted comedy. Darius' angelic reappearance towards the end smacks of opting for the easy way out. How else would Jeffrey have seen the error of his ways? It's the least convincing scene in the movie. Still, everything else is both funny and touching.

After all, even a comic book can have insight and a message.

The one thing it proved was that television talent doesn't always translate to the movies. Steven Weber was wooden, but Michael Weiss sexy and believable.  Nathan Lane as a gay priest was funny as was Sigourney Weaver.  Patrick Stewart was the best thing about this movie- his wisdom and composure at the illnes and death of Darius showed remarkable understanding of the condition of life and death in today's gay community.

Steven Weber's Jeffrey is like a male Carrie Bradshaw neurotic yet lovelorn; a navel-gazing New Yorker. The film also feels like Sex and the City (hereafter SATC), even though it was filmed two years before the first series of SATC began. It has that exaggerated, perky comic-realist feel that feels more like a TV movie than a real film. Like SATC, it revels in stereotypes which its core audience might find offensive, depending on their political persuasions, of course. But it's sad that an indie film of this stature did not make any attempt to challenge gay stereotypes. A missed opportunity.

As a drama, it was somewhat effective, but these scenes seemed a little out of place.  But in general, I'm still glad that I saw this film.  While the end result was only moderately satisfying, I still admire this attempt to make a generally light-hearted movie even though it focuses on a very serious subject.

As it started out, I was immediately captivated by the funny, easy-going style, even though the subject is not something people freely talk about. Jeffrey renouncing sex, and immediately afterwards looking hard at a tourist... the irony is layers thick and predictable, but nice all the same. The happy mood lasts about half the movie, then it's suddenly gone. You wonder what happened to it, and why the movie has taken such a serious turn, until near the end, Darius explains to Jeffrey. After that it's When Harry Met Harry, as the movie itself states. 4 out of 5 for the pure joie-de-vivre, shown in the first and preached in the second part of the movie. Also Patrick Stewart was adorable in his pink shirt and matching beret.

The film is low budget. The lead (Steven Weber) is less than believable; and the chemistry is sometimes lacking between Jeffrey (Weber) and Steve (Michael T. Weiss). However... The first time you see Steve (Weiss), as he turns around and smiles, it's worth the price of the movie. Mr. Weiss does an excellent job with his role. Patrick Stewart's over the top portrayal makes the movie. This is a very tongue-in-cheek look at gay life and love in the face of the AIDS epidemic. It has rough spots, but this movie is full of humor and good acting. The hoe-down fantasy scene was great. (Who knew this was a musical?) If they were aiming for realism they missed, but realism is much overrated.

Where it scores however is in catching the spirit of AIDS/gay men in the 90s'. It is hopeful in the face of disaster, funny in the shadow of death. It has been criticised for it's treatment of AIDS, but, speaking as someone with an intimate knowledge of the cursed disease, Jeffrey managed to acknowledge the tragedy of AIDS and celebrate the humanity of people with it. I loved Jeffrey; sexy, fun and irreverent it is a winner, and Patrick Stewart has never been is the quintessential gay man!

Some of the cameos are mildly amusing but it's not worth sitting through the rest to get to them. The lead male is horrible and the words Is this right for my career? may as well be tattooed on his forehead.

And all the way through it I was like Oh God, give me a break! Giving up totally on sex and love and shunning a brilliant prospective life partner JUST because of the AIDS epidemic?! Get a life! Sure, I understand Jeffrey's fears with the epidemic, but constantly pushing away Steve, his prospective Mr. Right, just made me want to slap him. Sure, there are good moments, such as people readily accepting homosexuality and the thugs who threatened to beat up Jeffrey acted beautifully, cruel and hatable, but beautifully nonetheless. But overall, this was nothing that special to see, and why include Mother Theresa? I thought it was somewhat awkward to put her in this movie. And at the end, I don't think that Steve would really forgive Jeffrey that quickly, if at all, after all that Jeffrey did to him. Please, don't waste time with this movie.

Certainly Patrick Stewart seems to be enjoying the role, in his pink beret and flouncing neckerchiefs, but generally I'm left thinking it's the woeful product of a straight person's impression of the gay world.
