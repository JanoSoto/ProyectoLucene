In one word I would say it is clever. A combination of mystery, suspense, drama, and Allen's ingenious humor, Manhattan Murder Mystery is my favorite Woody Allen movie. Perhaps my favorite movie - period. The plot was fresh, and having such humor with suspense is just too good. Another quality I enjoy in this movie is how Allen avoids an over-polished look. For instance, the scene where a neighbor in the hallway asks Paul about a rent increase. The actor appears to stumble for the right word, but Allen let the scene go that way giving it a very natural look. The restaurant scenes also portray realism with multiple conversations at one time; a quality I love in all of his movies. This makes reviewing the movies interesting- you pick up something new each time you watch it! Woody Allen's style is definitely an intelligent humor.

But having watched this film again recently I think it is a stunning achievement in comedy. Allen and Keaton have great chemistry as a couple in a humdrum marriage who stumble on to what turns out to be a murder cover-up. Watching all the people in this film try to figure out how to be detectives based on stuff they've seen in movies and read in books is hilarious, not to mention smart. The latenight dinner conversation among Allen, Keaton, Alda, and Huston is some of the best, sharpest, funniest, fastest dialogue ever written (or ad libbed).

Woody is at his best when he has Diane Keaton by his side and this proves it.  A lot of his more recent movies haven't been good, because he is pairing himself with much younger actresses who aren't as good at this type of comedy or who aren't good at all in the case of Helen Hunt.  This movie is hilarious even if you are my age (20).  I think it's refreshing to go the video store and rent a comedy that isn't either a stupid spoof, or a teen comedy that plays like a rated R sitcom.  This is a comedy that actually has a story, and Woody has the best lines.  If you don't like Woody's style though you won't like this, but if you have seen Annie Hall or any of his other movies and liked them then you should love this one.Zoopansick "},{"Title":"Great reunion with Keaton and Allen.","Date":"30 July 2005","Score":"26 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery","Review":" Manhattan Murder Mystery is a terrific Woody Allen film whit a wonderful mix of murder, mystery and comedy.

At least Diane Keaton's character thinks so, without really having a reason for that. She plays Carol Lipton, married to Larry Lipton (Woody Allen). They have just met their neighbors Paul (Jerry Adler) and Lillian House (Lynn Cohen) when Lillian dies. Because Paul is not that sad and is too ready to move on Carol becomes suspicious. When she is realizing certain strange events that has occurred her suspicion grows. Larry thinks it is pretty stupid but when a friend named Ted (Alan Alda) does believe her and helps her with the investigation he gets jealous and offers to help after all.Whether a real murder has committed is not the point, I guess. Allen gives us standard movie situations, ridicules them a little, and betters them then. There is a scene where Allen and Keaton go from an elevator into a basement when the lights fall out. It is completely dark, something we have seen more in thrillers, and for some reason Allen is able to make this clich√© thriller scene suspenseful. There are more of these moments. Since this is an Allen film there are a lot of links to other famous movies (the script itself is a little like Hitchcock's 'Rear Window') and famous scenes, the ending in particular does a terrific job in reliving one of the most memorable scenes out there. (It has to with mirrors, I guess you know what movie I am talking about). This light Allen comedy is a terrific mystery story with brilliant touches that will be liked not only by Allen-fans, but by everyone who loves either comedy or mystery suspense.

Most people believed he couldn't do comedies anymore. It turns out he hadn't lost his touch and turned out one of his best movies. Seeing Keaton and Allen playing a couple was great (they always worked so well off each other) and, for once, Allen isn't the neurotic one--Keaton is! It was fun seeing him play the strongest partner in a relationship. The dialogue is hilarious--one good line after another and the murder mystery itself is very intricate and interesting. Also there are a number of great old songs playing in the background that perfectly complement the movie--especially The Big Noise from Winnetka (for when they drive across the bridge at night). And I loved that homage to Orson Welles Lady from Shanghai at the end.The acting is almost all great. Allen and Keaton are just wonderful--right on target and acting (and speaking) like an old married couple. Alan Alda pops up as Keaton's best friend. I never really liked him but he's OK here. Anjelica Huston (looking incredible) also pops up and gives a very strong (and very funny) supporting role. Also look for Zack Braff (from the TV series Srubs) in his very first role as Keaton and Allen's son (!!!)My only complaint--the jerky, hand held camera-work. It worked fine in Allen's dramas but is just out of place here--the camera should move fluidly in a comedy. That's a small quibble though. This is WELL worth seeing.

Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and actor, and that is the reason why I do not dare to say that this film is one of his best films because I love practically all his filmography.Manhattan Murder Mystery has mystery, suspense and the refined and witty humor typical from Woody Allen. One of my favorite moments is when Larry compares the need to Carol returning to her shrink with a GM's recall. Another very funny moment is when the clumsy Larry plays the wrong tape during the phone conversation with Paul. If the reader wants to spend 104 minutes laughing, watch Manhattan Murder Mystery since this film is funny even for those that are not fans of Woody Allen.

(For some, Allen will always be irritating, no matter how brilliant the movie.) Without a shred of pretension, and without really any suspense in the usual murder mystery way, we get sucked into what is perhaps the most believable of murder mysteries ever. The reason is simple. It's told as if two very ordinary, slightly bookish, not so slightly neurotic New Yorkers stumble on a murder.It's the story of what we would all do if we thought our neighbor had murdered his wife. The bumbling, the doubts, the revelations, the sneaking around, the giggling. It helps (a lot) that we have the reuniting of Allen with Diane Keaton, and it's a nice breeze in the room to have both Alan Alda at his ordinary guy best and Angelica Huston as a true New Yorker brimming with confidence and savvy. (Huston is from California, a daughter in the famous movie family. Alda, nicely enough, is a New Yorker for real.)Don't expect anything deep, hilarious, or clever (three of the many intentions in Allen's movies). But it's really well made, superbly written, acted with utter believability, paced with snap, and filled with small surprises. Using the crack team Allen had in place in this period (set designer, photographer, editor, etc.), almost nothing could go wrong. As long as you like this kind of thing in the first place--a Woody Allen movie in the easy going vein.I loved it.

He plays Larry Lipton, a New York City book editor, whose wife Carol (Diane Keaton) becomes convinced that one of their apartment neighbors is a murderer. Half the enjoyment of this film is watching, and listening to, neurotic Larry as he reacts to his wife's excellent sleuthing adventure. She and Larry's friend Ted (Alan Alda) plot strategy on how to catch the presumed murderer, much to the chagrin of Larry.Some of the dialogue is amusing, like when Carol insists that Larry accompany her to the suspects' apartment for some serious nosing around. Says Larry I can't relax; I'm in a strange man's apartment in my T-shirt and pajamas.My impression is that at least some of the dialogue is semi-improvised. Whatever the dialogue method, the result is back and forth banter that sounds highly natural and convincing. When you combine this naturalistic style of talk with terrific performances by Allen, Keaton, Alda, and several other actors, the time flies by, and you're sorry when the film ends.The murder mystery element isn't really believable. But that's okay, since it's strictly ancillary to the characterizations and the humorous talk. Even so, there is indeed a puzzle that will be solved by the film's end.Editing and cinematography are fine. Background music features 1930's and 40's pop songs. With all the NYC street scenes, I even learned what New Yorkers mean when they refer to a crosstown bus.Normally, I don't care for talky films. But the dialogue here is so clever that the cinematic experience is pleasant despite a talk heavy script. Manhattan Murder Mystery provides a lot of enjoyment, at the expense of a neurotic character whose life is turned into a fun house of comically scary and startling events.

The reunion of Keaton and Allen as a married couple, Larry and Carol Lipton, trying to figure out if their new next door neighbor has committed murder of his wife is their last film together, and IMO, the funniest.

I have been Allen's fan for many years and I've seen every movie he's made. Manhattan Murder Mystery may not be considered his masterpiece but it is very high on my list of all- time favorite films and one of the most beloved comedies ever. It is so clever and funny that I would take it with me to any deserted island, and if I felt lonely and down, I'd watch the scene in the hotel's lift, and the Allen's face when he delivers one of his funniest lines ever, Claustrophobia and a dead body - this is a neurotic's jackpot! I believe Manhattan Murder Mystery has more witty and hilarious dialogs and one-liners than any of Allen's films, and I enjoy every one of them. Allen claims to have indulged himself with this movie in which he referred openly to such classics of cinema as Double Indemnity, Rear Window, and The Lady from Shanghai. The third time collaboration of Allen and Marshall Brickman in writing the script (Annie Hall, Manhattan) proved to be brilliant.

This is a comedy quartet alone make the film work. Jerry Adler is also good as the neighbour who is feared to be a murderer. All the characters seem so vibrant and alive, like the city it is set in. When Allen, Keaton, Alda and Huston all meet in a caf√© at 1 in the morning to discuss their findings, I could not help but feel attracted to the atmosphere Allen had created - the city that never sleeps.The plot never sleeps either, even though it is relatively simple. The fun derives from the fact that these upper-middle class New Yorkers make their life more interesting by trying to solve a murder. The story seems so warm and approachable - like Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days.The story of murder is mixed with wry humour and a little light violence. We go from a scene of a body being melted, to a hilarious phone scene. It is this juxtaposition of genres that creates the films success. The actors are all immersed in their characters, but sometimes they are off guard - and thank god too. We actually get genuine laughs from the actors. We see it here (the ending) and also in Annie Hall (1977), when Alvy Singer and Annie Hall are in the kitchen with lobsters.Furthermore, the story is genuinely a good mystery albeit a light one. The film references are all their too - The Lady from Shanghai (1948)for example. To some extent Allen expects knowledge from the viewer - the film references (this film has them, Face to Face in Annie Hall, the re-used but never stale jokes (sock filled with horse manure gag...Annie Hall and Radio Days) and various key figures of our times (Freud spoke of a latency period...Wagner music...lots more).Visually the film is good too. The first few shots of New York were surprising for me. They were not as romanticised as previous films - at least not to me. It seemed more like a Michael Mann film, with the city lights.So overall, I am glad Woody lightened up. This film is accessible, yet has many shades. I loved Husbands and Wives, but the Bergman-esquire relationship quarrels are not too fun to watch on your average night in.This film is charming, well acted and most of all a great time.

Yet, that is not the point of Woody Allen's screenplay. Unlike a lot of other writers, he focuses more on the characters and their reactions to these unusual situations; these are not people who suddenly turn into great private eyes when the plot requires them to. They are real, genuine and make plenty of mistakes that make us laugh. Allen gives one of his funniest performances on film and the return of Diane Keaton proves how warm and charming they are together still after all these years.

One could look at this film as him giving into the ones who demanded comedy for so many years, as he again creates a character hellbent on perfection and consumed by his petulant neuroses. Looking at this from a more comedic angle than his previous works, this is one of the funniest Woody Allen movies I have yet to see, surpassing even the heavily comedic undertones of works such as Midnight in Paris and Whatever Works.Allen rounds up Diane Keaton again in the leading female role, perfectly replicating the kind of atmosphere he created in Annie Hall, one of his first films to be recognized by even the Academy as a significant achievement in dramatic filmmaking. The two are a couple, named Larry and Carol Lipton, respectively, who are invited to coffee by Paul House (Jerry Adler) and Lilian (Lynn Cohen), who live next door to them in a highrise building. They have a few cups of coffee, as Carol enthusiastically talks with Lilian about her new treadmill, as they are both trying to remain in shape as they approach their elderly years. They leave the apartment not long after and return home to their quiet little sanctuary (mainly so Larry can catch the Bob Hope movie on Television).The next day, after returning home, they see a crowd outside of the House's apartment and find officers and a coroner on scene reporting that Lilian died of a heart attack. This comes as a grand shock to both Larry and Carol seeing as Lilian appeared healthier and more active than folks half her age, but it comes as a greater shock to Carol that the next day upon seeing Paul that he doesn't seem burdened or even upset by the sudden death of his wife. This sends Carol into a Nancy Drew-like frenzy, sneaking into the House's apartment, invading their privacy, and completely going overboard in her amateur investigation. Larry becomes frustrated at Carol's childish, intrusive behavior, but becomes more concerned when he notices that their friend Ted (Alan Alda) becomes entangled with the mystery at hand here and is getting awfully close to his wife. He realizes that in order to try and even continue a relationship with this woman that he'll need to play along and overall regain her attention.This is when Manhattan Murder Mystery becomes more about love and passion (or lack thereof) than it does the inherent murder and/or mystery. We see that Carol is doing this Nancy Drew investigation not to irritate or intimidate her husband, but almost as a way to cope with a dying, less successful marriage. This is her only outlet of excitement in an increasingly bitter world.Woody Allen marinated in the field of drama so long that American audiences thought he lacked the skills and the ability to make a compelling, silly, ribald comedy. Consider those audiences served by the filmmaking desperado himself. Allen delivers not only a funny, but a terrifically engrossing drama about the dying spark in a once prosperous marital relationship and the ridiculous methods one will use as a catalyst in desperate times.Allen and Keaton, once more, put on a fabulous show, giving us believable characters to enjoy watching, and side characters such as Jerry Adler and Alan Alda are fun to watch and provide grand entertainment. This is one of the strongest comedies Allen has ever made, way more competent that one of his odes to slapstick.Starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Jerry Adler, and Lynn Cohen.

To give you an idea, Larry loves watching ice hockey games while Carol prefers to listen to Wagner; she loves Manhattan's nightlife while he'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed. The differences between Carol and Larry get more obvious when they meet Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), an old couple living in the same floor. In a remarkably dialog-driven sequence, we feel Carol's enthusiasm to have an extra-time for socializing and Larry's impatience to live and stop enduring Mr. House's collection of stamps. At the end, we're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking, their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism. They have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of Manhattan, which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film's three titular 'M'. We learn that Carol wants to open a restaurant, Larry believes it's a foolish decision to take so late in life, yet one of their recently divorced friends Ted (Alan Alda) encourages her. We get it; Larry enjoys his life's pacific serenity while Carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it's too late. Many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ, but Allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous Husbands and Wives as if he was tired of hostile arguments. He leaves more room for Ted, whose adventurous temperament fits Carol's thirst for newness, not without feeling jealous about that. It's a pivotal, even crucial moment in Carol and Harry's marital life.Yet the title doesn't lie on the film's premise it's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine. Speaking of the mystery, if the previous scene where they meet the friendly Houses' couple reminded me of Rosemary's Baby when Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes met the Castevets, I was even more struck by the plot's similarities when after a night out, Carol and Larry discovers that Mrs. House died of a heart attack. Much more, Mr. House looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a twin-cemetery, raising Carol's suspicion. She had a heart condition, he says, Carol insists that Mrs. House never mentioned that. At that point, we know what she's about, she smells something fishy and whether she's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills. And the difference of attitudes between Carol and Larry is the film's comedic basis.Indeed, the conflict between Carol who wants to go further and Larry who wants her to stop, will originate one of Woody Allen's funniest lines Is that what you do when I'm forbidding? I'm not going to forbid you a lot, if you do. The greatest delight of Manhattan Murder Mystery relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa. Carol's amateurish investigation, her growing complicity with Ted, and Larry's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril, are magnificently portrayed. And all these interactions culminate with the help of Marcia Fox, played by a scene-stealing Angelica Huston, a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player, so intuitive that she'll even steal Carol's thunder in the crime- solving process, and fascinate both Ted and Larry. As a counterpart to Carol's personality, like Ted for Larry, Marcia Fox will also teach Carol a few things about the word 'jealousy'. After, Husbands and Wives, a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for Woody Allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with Mia Farrow, Manhattan Murder Mystery feels like a moment of pure refreshment. If it's not the best of Woody Allen's rich filmography, not nominated for a Best Original Screenplay or Best Supporting Acting Oscar (while it deserved some accolades) it's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we'd expect from Woody Allen. And the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely Diane Keaton's comeback and her incredible chemistry with Woody Allen. Indeed, I have much admiration to Mia Farrow, and she'll be forever associated with some of Allen's greatest achievements, but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in Farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos, and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in Husbands and Wives where not only her character, but the actress herself looked both unhappy, embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives. Woody Allen said Mia likes to do funny things, but she's not as broad a comedian as Diane is, although I don't approve the manner but I have to agree with the director, Mia Farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned, Diane Keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference. Yes, we have the New York middle-class lifestyle, the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends, Allen's neurotic personality (a dead body and claustrophobia, a neurotic's jackpot), his distaste for Wagner, a compositor who gives him the urge to invade Poland and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women's relationships, all the ingredients for a great Allen's film are here but Diane Keaton is the icing on the cake.And believe me, she's for more than three quarters in what make Manhattan Murder Mystery such a delicious pastry, reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with Woody Allen, hell, even when they argue, they're hilarious.

One of the neighbors dies of heart attack. Carol is depicted as a friendly and a nosy neighbor and is convinced that the death was a murder as she felt Lillian (dead neighbor) was too healthy to die of a heart attack and suspects that the husband was responsible for it. Carol takes it on her to solve the mystery of this murder otherwise the murderer will get away with a murder; thus the name of the movie Manhattan Murder Mystery.Larry is shown as a simple man, an editor in a publishing house, who believes neighbor should mind their own business and wants to respect that. He is not a big fan of adventure of solving a murder mystery unlike his wife. Carol is driven by the urge to solve the murder mystery and teams up with the couples' friend Ted (Alan Alda) as she feels he is more enthused about nabbing the murderer.The movie is such a delight to watch. Even though there is a murder in the plot and suspense building up, Woody makes sure that you as the audience don't miss out on your belly full of laughter. Woody has done an amazing job as a writer, director and actor to make this gruesome murder mystery a complete comic experience. The on-screen chemistry that Diane and Woody share is just amazing and makes you believe they are truly made for each other. It reminds me of the couple in Annie Hall. One of my favorite scenes from the movie is when Larry and friends calls Mr. House for ransom with a series of coordinated recorded voices. Woody is just hysterical with his clumsy way.The best part about this movie and most of Woody Allen's movies is the fact that it is very natural. The movie banks heavily on the witty script and the natural flow of conversations which makes you feel a part of the conversation rather than just an audience. Woody capitalizes on the imperfections and spoofs in the movie giving it a more realistic feel to the movie. I feel this movie is an all time classic, evergreen and can be enjoyed over and over again. It's a complete family entertainment. I give this movie a 4er. If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it or buy the movie and watch it as I am sure you will fall in love with the movie.

I have to say I enjoyed the film. It was entertaining, funny but yet so sad.The mystery is actually engrossing!The film is about two characters who are miserable in their love lives (for different reasons) and in a strange country far from home. Their friendship develops so nicely and quickly that they become so attached to each other that saying goodbye is the hardest thing in the world.As much as the film shows happiness in the form of the friendship, the film touches you in an all different way towards its end.

Or at least he fooled me. The plot itself is very clever, the murder plot being loaded with wit and old film noir and pulp novel knowledgability and the subplots and characters being typical Woody Allen tools accompany it with a successfully funny irony. It just seems so quick, so fleeting, so light.Really though, there is a lot of nuance that goes into this little film. In some sense like a Billy Wilder film (perhaps the reason for the film's early Double Indemnity reference), Woody will use cinematic techniques very heavily, but absolutely none of it is called to attention. There are minute details everywhere, from an elusive black cat crossing during a seemingly inconsequential expository scene, and the intent to keep decorative flowers in the foreground throughout shots of Woody and Keaton bickering about the possibility of foul play on the part of their neighbor. When Alan Alda is talking on the phone with Keaton at a questionable hour of the night, he puts his beer on his coffee table and the camera stays on it, evoking volumes about his character in relation to Keaton, his loneliness, his emptiness. This is all done so well indeed that the effortlessness can almost be mistaken for no effort. The cinematography is characterized by an almost entirely hand-held quality, simple pointing and shooting, panning and zooming, following, the most elementary employments. But in the apparent deficiency of technique, there is enormously effective technique. He relaxes our attention to aesthetics, and so we feel that we're watching a light, breezy little geriatric romantic comedy.Indeed, a central theme of the movie seems to be indifference, which tends to come with age when people seem to unfussily accept that there are many things they've never gotten to do and probably never will, and in effect some, like Woody's character, seem to see life's reality as a place where nothing exciting happens so there's no reason to feel dejected because there's no point of comparison to make between yesterday and today. It gives the murder plot a refreshing sense of adventure for Keaton and Woody must awaken from his humble grind to save his marriage from her newfound sense of excitement.Sometimes, its the unadorned format that gives the film stylistic release. There is one moment where Keaton glances out of a restaurant window at a passing city bus. This is the kind of shot that could've looked differently in the hands of nearly every other director. It's a murder mystery after all, and one would take for granted the manipulation of light, a sleeker film stock, but no. It is as if we are looking not at a screen depiction but looking in real life at a passing bus on the street.The two have not lost any of their flare as a comic duo. Roughly thirty years after Sleeper, Love and Death and Annie Hall, they have a chemistry to which Woody's teamings with his other female leads cannot compare. They both have so much character even while playing the age-old staples of their acting careers; Woody plays virtually the only role of his entire acting career. There's just a wise humility to their on-screen antics that keeps them ripe.

We could be living next to a murderer, Carol Lipton (Diane Keaton) emphasizes to her doubtful husband, Larry (Woody Allen). Larry isn't so convinced New York is a melting pot I'm used to it! When put in the situation of having a murderer live next door, there are two kinds of people there are (1) the bored who decide their life could use a little fluffer, deciding to solve the mystery themselves, like a modern day Miss Marple, or (2) the fearful who figure it would be best to mind their own business and let karma stop by sometime in the future.Trouble is, Carol is of the first category, Larry of the second. She can't rest until she really knows what's going on; Larry, however, would rather go to work, come home for dinner at 500, stay up until the late hours of the evening to catch a forgotten classic on the classic movie channel, and continue the same routine for the rest of his life, spicing it up in safe ways when the occasion arises. But Carol has a mind of her own, and Larry, being played by Woody Allen (in which case meaning Allen is basically playing himself), is much too weak of a figure to stop her Nancy Drew madness.Who can blame her? Here's the situation as the film opens, Larry and Carol bump into their aging neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen), who proceed to casually invite them up for coffee. The two are dull, but sweet reaching old age, they have already purchased twin headstones, filling their days with blissful uneventfulness and hobbies like stamp collecting. Larry finds them pleasantly boring; the invitation was polite, sure, but neighbors are meant to be neighbors, not friends. Yet just as he's stating this sentiment to the kooky Carol, the unexpected happens with brute force. The following day, Mrs. House is announced dead. She had a heart condition.Larry is surprised but figures it to be another tragedy in the cruel game of life; Carol, on the other hand, is suspicious. Mrs. House never mentioned having a heart condition (strange considering she felt the need to discuss her hysterectomy only minutes into conversation). Mr. House must have murdered her. So she decides to do a little investigating herself, and, as it turns out, something is amiss. One point Carol, zero points Larry.These days, Woody Allen seems to travel back and forth between meaningful work and more passable fare. Critics flock to his old-age unevenness like a group of hungry vultures, but I've always enjoyed what he has to offer. When he's taking a break from changing the lives of his audience and having fun for a change, it's infectious (most of the time). Manhattan Murder Mystery is his finest, dare I say it, lightweight project. I could be biased, considering I watched the majority of his most famous films when I was too young to really understand their meaning, but over the years, Manhattan Murder Mystery has always stuck with me the most. Is it the contagiously humorous repartee between Allen and Keaton (in their first film together since 1979's Manhattan), the obvious homages to film noir(you can't beat The Lady from Shanghai playfulness of the ending) and Agatha Christie, the likable supporting performances from Alan Alda (the likable best friend type) and Anjelica Huston (the superiorly cool female figure), the New York setting? I can hardly decide, but Allen's deft combination of whodunit antics and absolutely hilarious exchanges makes every single thing about Manhattan Murder Mystery an unequivocal delight. And because he's realistic, of course he slides marital trouble and middle-aged discontent into the mix; it's the only way such an exciting story could exist in real life!With a luminous Keaton by his side, a truckload of his best lines (Claustrophobia and a dead body - this is a neurotic's jackpot!; I can't listen to that much Wagner. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.), and an unabashed sense of fun, Manhattan Murder Mystery is Allen at his best confident, sensible, engaging, and uproarious.

As always with Allen it's adroitly directed and beautifully made with a noir-ish feel that adds so much to the atmosphere and mystery. The music is energetic and haunting, adding much to the comedic and mystery aspects of the story. Love the old songs too, they have a very nostalgic quality and easy to recognise. The writing is hilarious and in distinctive Allen fashion- not quite among the best screenplays of all time but some of the lines here are some of the most quotable from any Woody Allen film- while also keeping the suspense to nail-biting effect. Manhattan Murder Mystery works brilliantly both as a comedy and mystery. The comedy never takes a heavy-handed approach- in fact a lot of it is quite light- and always amuses and the mystery aspect is even better, very Hitchcockian(there was a very Rear Window influence here) and intricate and with great atmosphere and suspense. A highlight is the ending with the mirror sequence paying homage to Lady in Shanghai, it really has to be one of the best ever endings of any of Allen's films and is also very visually striking. The characters as with many Woody Allen films are purposefully neurotic but also compelling in their realism and they all serve a point to the story, no superficiality in sight. Allen gets great performances from the cast and his own performance is excellent. He has believable chemistry with Diane Keaton who gives her absolute all to her most neurotic, bat-out-of-hell character yet. Anjelica Huston is strong as usual though she has given better performances in meatier roles and while Alan Alda gives a better performance in Crimes and Misdemeanors (a textbook example of how to play a weasel of a character well, brilliantly in his case) but he doesn't disappoint either. Overall, a brilliant film and one of Allen's best, a minor work this is not. 10/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A Well-Written & Well-Acted Film!","Date":"11 February 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery","Review":" Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema delivers A Well-Written & Well-Acted Film in 'Manhattan Murder Mystery'.

After all, as a long-married Upper West Side couple, they rekindle their natural chemistry like no time has passed at all since 1977's Annie Hall and 1979's Manhattan. That's the primary but not the only joy to be derived from watching this often hilarious cat-and-mouse tale.As they see their son (a young Zach Braff) off to college, Carol and Larry Lipton have become mired in a routine marital routine until Lillian House, an elderly neighbor, suddenly dies. It appears to be a heart attack, but Carol suspects foul play involving Lillian's husband. Most of the plot has Carol sleuthing for clues to fit her Agatha Christie-like murder theory with the help of Ted, a friend too close for Larry's comfort. Of course, Larry thinks Carol is going off the deep end and becomes jealous of Ted's burgeoning involvement in the case. Enter Marcia Fox, a glamorous, crafty writer who devises creative ways to unearth the killer (the pre-recorded phone conversation scene is a hoot), and you have romantic complications mixed up chaotically with the mystery. Naturally the shenanigans enliven the Lipton marriage.Co-written by Allen and Marshall Brickman, reunited years after those first two classic Allen-Keaton films, this is all fun stuff and a great excuse for the filmmaker to pay tribute to favorite classics like The Thin Man, Rear Window and The Lady from Shanghai. Allen is Allen as Larry, a good thing here, and Keaton is her breezy energetic self as Carol. Again using his unctuous personality to advantage, Alan Alda plays Ted like the talkative friend you don't quite trust. Ideally cast, Angelica Huston is at her cunning best as Marcia. Carlo DiPalma's cinematography is a bit too shaky for my taste especially when the details of the characters' clandestine actions are divulged. But the other Allen touches are in check here, and the result is an ingratiating entertainment.

But think about it--he's tackled comedy (of course), sci fi (Sleeper), romance, heavy drama, musical, spy movie, serious thriller and with this film, comic thriller.  But Manhattan Murder Mystery has its moments of bona fide Hithcockian suspense.  POSSIBLE SPOILER  When Diana Keaton breaks into her neighbor's apartment, looking for evidence that he murdered his wife, and he unexpectedly comes home is just one example.  The subtext of the film is just as engrossing as the Manhattan Murder Mystery; the notion of bored spouses (and ex-spouses, in the case of Alan Alda's character) looking for something, anything, to latch on to that breaks them away from their daily rituals.  There is a bit of Mia Farrow's Alice and her character from Husbands and Wives in Keaton's character, and it comes as no surprise that Farrow was originally scheduled to play Keaton's character.  But her fallout with Woody prevented that, and Diane Keaton makes the most of it.  It's nice to see her and Woody together again.  They are still friends, according to what I've read, and maybe they'll do another movie together.  The movie is basically a highly enjoyable comic mystery--a throwback to movies like The Thin Man and Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes and his other light thrillers--set amid Allen's usual assortment of high maintenance and high strung New Yorkers.  Not a classic Woody Allen film, but a fun one and also one of the few Woody Allen films of the '90s to appeal to all audiences, even Woody bashers.

Marcia is soon involved in the conspiracy theory, and brandishes even more impressive ideas as to how Paul House may have ended and disposed of his wife - much to the dismay of Carol, who is intimidated by her sexy presence and sharp mind.  Carol, Larry, Ted, and Marcia soon find themselves constructing a scheme to trick Paul into admitting he murdered his wife, even though they're not completely sure he did.  What's makes this film so enjoyable is that it's a very slight return to slapstick for Allen.  Woody is hilarious sitting on a sofa entangling himself in miles of cassette tape while the others try to create a mock telephone conversation with Paul using tape recorders.  Carlo Di Palma's jerky cinematography and Susan Morse's twitchy editing combine to create a rickety, but intimate look. Woody's predictable reliance on old jazz standards works well (although it doesn't in a few of his other films).The funniest thing about this film is its structural resemblances to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window.  The premise of both films regard a couple investigating the possibility that a neighbor murdered their spouse.  The two main characters in Rear Window, L.B. Jeffries and Lisa Freemont, are mirrored by the characters of Carol and Marcia, respectively.  Carol is the imaginative idealist who demands that her morbid theories come true, and Marcia is the cool beauty who seems to have solved the puzzle once presented with all the clues.  It's also interesting that Woody chose to reunite with Keaton for this film.  The basic plot of Manhattan Murder Mystery was originally constructed for what eventually evolved into Annie Hall, Allen & Keaton's most famous collaboration (the murder mystery story was dropped when the love story sub-plot developed).  This is a giddy, impromptu Woody film, but it's just as sophisticated as everything else he's done.

Here they play Larry and Carol Lipton, a husband and wife with a grown son where life for Carol anyway has become humdrum. One night they meet an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen) on their floor and join them for coffee. The next day Mrs. House is dead of a heart attack, and Carol decides there's been foul play. She confides in her divorced friend Ted (Alan Alda) and before you know it, she's snooping around Mr. House's apartment, following him and doing stakeouts with Ted.This is a wonderful comedy that has a very improvisational feel and two people who act and talk just like a married couple - except funnier because Woody's the husband. It's amazing to watch as these creative people - Carol, an excellent cook who is thinking of starting a restaurant, Larry, an editor, Marcia (Angelica Huston) one of his writers, and Ted build up the case and decide how to catch the murderous husband. The scene where the four have dinner is one of the best as the waiters listen in on what sounds like four people plotting a murder. The other classic is Marcia conducting all of them on a phone call that relies on each pressing the button of a tape recorder when she points at them. The sight of her panicking and pointing as Larry's tape unravels and he tries to fix it is priceless.The acting is superb, Allen his usual hilarious neurotic self, complaining to his wife that he can't listen to too much Wagner because it gives him the urge to conquer Poland and freaking out when he's stuck in an elevator. Keaton is pretty, energetic, and a riot as Carol as she goes through her empty nest crisis, angry because Larry gave Marcia a paperback he didn't give her and jealous when Ted starts to pay attention to Marcia. I think we have to re-evaluate our lives, she announces to her husband when she learns about the paperback. As a lonely divorc√©e, Alda gives a wonderful performance, and Angelica Huston as a beautiful, savvy, tough poker-playing writer is perfection.Woody Allen has made some heavy-duty films, comedies, and along the way, he's had a few misfires. After some of his more ponderous films, Manhattan Murder Mystery may seem like a throwaway. It isn't. It's a pure delight from beginning to end filled with mystery, suspense, humor and real people we can love.

The mystery plot is solid as well - this must be one of Woody Allen's strongest films plot-wise.

He also gives generous portions of the comedy to the other actors, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, and Angelica Huston.

As he knows both of them very well, more than a suspense thriller, his film appears as an acute observation of Manhattan people. The viewer is shown what Manhattan is and what type of people inhabit this area which has the reputation of being one of New York city's best known addresses. The film is replete with typically Woody Allen style humor which consists of short and witty remarks about people and their idiosyncrasies. For this reason, director Woody Allen created his own alter ego in the form of Larry Lipton, an intellectual editor who seems to be getting closer to a young woman as his wife is getting much too curious about a death which happened in their neighborhood. Emotional problems between husbands and wives occupy a good deal of screen space in Woody Allen's films. This is also the case with this film as its numerous subplots deal with the emotional turmoil of men and women. Lastly, there is something enigmatic about movie titles as there are times when viewers don't get to see much of what is described in the title. Judging from that yardstick, Manhattan Murder Mystery tries hard to cash on to that obsession and also succeeds. This is probably one reason why it enabled Woody Allen to show his cinematographic preferences in this film by including numerous important scenes from his favorite Hollywood films.

This underrated Woody Allen comedy is one of my favorite Allen films. Allen and Diane Keaton, still the best of his many leading ladies, play an upper class, snooty New York couple who go sleuthing when the wife suspects their next-door neighbor of murder. If this plot description conjures images of Rear Window, it should. Hitchcock's film is payed obvious homage, as are many of the 1940s and 50s films noir that provide this film the style that it parodies (in fact, the characters go to see a showing of Double Indemnity at one point, and the ending is a spoof of Orson Welles' Lady from Shanghai.) Allen and Keaton are simply terrific together, deftly stumbling their way through physical comedy bits and one-liners like a nebbish version of Nick and Nora Charles. They're obviously having a great time, and so do we. Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston are also on hand in large supporting roles, and they're hilarious as well. The highlight of the film is a scene in which the four of them are at dinner and actually hatch the scheme for nabbing the murder suspect. It's one of the best moments of ensemble work ever filmed for an Allen movie.Favorite line, delivered by Allen to Keaton as she goes out snooping in the middle of the night against his protests Is this what you do when I forbid you?

Alan Alda and Angelica Huston provide feisty support, especially Alda, who's quite playful here. While this is basically a long running gag about being nosy and suspicious, there is an undercurrent of seriousness below the goofy parts about growing older and livening up the duller routines of life. While it's not recommended to spy on your neighbors to see if they're killers or not, having an adventure with the person you've been married to a long time is something to consider; be it just around the corner or somewhere unfamiliar. That aside, this is a lively counterpart to Allen's previous Husbands and Wives, which was filled with bitterness inside its rich comic moments, as well as a pleasant diversion. It's really refreshing seeing Allen and Keaton together as a lovable couple, with no one cheating on each other, although a few slight scenes do discuss some hidden jealousies and insecurities. Keaton has some of her best bits being a snoop here and this may qualify as one of her better comic roles. Plus she always has the best clothes. Only she could carry off that wardrobe of hers.

But when I caught this on Bravo the other night, I found it to be a highly entertaining, occasionally suspenseful flick.  Sure, there isn't much substance to the whole thing.  Sure, Allen and Diane Keaton, as the married couple whose neighbor may have bumped off his wife, improvise half their dialogue, or give a very good imitation of it, and argue awfully loudly in their apartment at 130 in the morning.  But there are plenty of great lines and scenes, and yes, just the faintest tinge of tension and suspense at the right moments.  I also was struck by Diane Keaton's performance.  Despite the apparent improvisation, she was really good, believeable, funny, and even sympathetic as the wife who gets cuaght up in investigating the murder for many different reasons.  She does have great chemistry with Allen.  And considering all I've read about Allen, it was awfully and atypically (?) generous of him to practically hand her the whole first half of the movie.  Not that his performance wasn't good; it was, but he didn't really get going until near the end, when his character finally started to believe it all and got involved.  Alan Alda is fine as the man who's like a girlfriend to Keaton, and Anjelica Huston certainly made the most of her scenes as the writer who figures out the whole case and its solution in one sitting.

For one thing, Manhattan Murder Mystery has plot. Lots of it. But it's too drawn out toward the end. Tighter directing and editing jobs would easily raise this film another notch. The cast and their performances are all good. And, for once, Woody Allen's role (as Larry Lipton) doesn't grate on the nerves. He's still the whining, complaining persona, but toned down quite a lot. The script is much better with some very witty and funny lines that diminish the unnerving aspect of his character. So, I enjoyed this film much more, and had a number of good laughs. The humor is mostly in the dialog. Along with Woody and his usual female lead, Diane Keaton (as wife, Carol), this film has some nice cast additions in Alan Alda as Ted, Anjelica Huston as Marcia and others. Here's a sample of some funny lines from the film. Larry says to Carol, I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.Ted, in the conversation at dinner on a group night out This would be a really great way to kill somebody. You clog their arteries with whipped cream ... chocolate mousse ... butter. They go like that.

Larry, How do you know it was her? Did the ashes resemble Mrs. House?Carol, I don't know why you're not more fascinated with this. I mean, we could be living next door to a murderer, Larry. Larry, Well, New York is a melting pot. I'm used to it.Larry, Yes, I know I'm a bore because I don't break the law. You know, I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull.Ted, I'm gonna be late for my shrink.Larry, walking with Carol down the hall of a residence hotel, Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots blue powder sprinkled along the baseboards.Larry to Carol, You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet.Incidentally, 1993 was a truly great year for films with much competition for awards. So, this Woody Allen film didn't receive any awards or a single nomination. But that's nothing to detract from the film in a year that saw such great ones as Schindler's List, In the Name of the Father, The Remains of the Day, Philadelphia, What's Love Got to Do with It, Shadowlands, The Fugitive, The Age of Innocence; and a host of other very good movies. Had Annie Hall, half of this competition in 1977, I doubt it would have won a single Oscar. But, if Manhattan Murder Mystery had been up in the same year as Annie Hall, I think it would have beat Annie out in awards. As several other reviewers noted, when comparing them side by side, Manhattan is by far a funnier and more entertaining movie.

Alan Alda, too, plays a generic Alda character that we've seen in Allen films several times before. Diane Keaton is the film's saving grace - it's great to see her work with Allen again for the first time since the masterpiece Manhattan - and she's at her very best, as is Anjelica Huston in a smaller but unforgettable part.

And on that level alone it certainly succeeds. I would probably place it in the same vein as 'Small Time Crooks' in the respect that its one of his pure comedies, but (like all of Allen's films) still has room for subtext, in this case commenting on the banality that faces married couples.  I think that Allen is saying that boredom in marriage is something natural and inevitable, but doesn't seem to be condoning looking outside of the marriage to change things (look at what happens to the characters here when they do). The problems have to be looked at by the couple themselves.  And what a couple it is Diane Keaton and Woody Allen have rare comedic chemistry that is consistently a joy to watch. The script may not be comparable to Allen's best but the casting, in my opinion at least, compensates for this.  Anjelica Huston and Alan Alda are also effective in their supporting roles, Huston in particular as the enigmatic author.  Even Joy Behar (the Noo Yawker on TV's 'The View') is acceptable and not grating in a minor role.N.B.  The film contains references and allusions to some of the film noirs 'Double Indemnity' and 'Lady from Shanghai' in particular.  I think that the latter film may be important to see so one can fully appreciate the ending. One of the great things about Allen is that unlike  many other contemporary film makers, he works on the assumption that the audience does know something has seen important movies and has read important books, so will be able to understand such references.Recommended, regardless of whether you happen to be an Allen aficionado.

Although these films were quite favourable with highbrow critics I think a lot of his true fans found them to be rather detached & remote from the Allen we all know and love.The great thing about Allen is his unique writing style. It would be too easy just to pigeonhole him as some kind of wise cracking stand-up comic; a lot of his humour is very subtle with a generous helping of heavy irony mixed in with regards life's many mysteries & contradictions. I think that's why he finds it easy to hide behind his neurotic outer skin much easier to cast satirical barbs from within.Manhattan Murder Mystery (MMM), is a return to form for the Meister in spite of all his personal problems being aired over the TV networks at around this time. I think it was just as well he chose Keaton rather than Farrow for the part of his wife, not just because of the off-screen problems but the chemistry for a comedy is perfect with Keaton & Allen together.Okay so its not much of a mystery (not many murders either). We're not talking Agatha Christie indepth style of detective analysis either. Instead WA plays it straight down the line some mild slapstick, witty one-liners, keen social observations, the usual paranoias/neurosis and of course some intellectual jousting with fellow chattering-class types.Anjelica Huston works surprisingly well here too. Not generally renowned for this kind of staged comedy, she does a pretty goody job as Alan Alda's potential girlfriend, come amateur detective. There's also plenty of adlibbing going on as you might expect from an Allen script. He writes so freely there's plenty of room for self expression from all of the actors without deflecting too much away from the mood & pace of the story.The ending is a little goofy & tiresome, and somehow doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the film, which is a great shame. But either way MMM is a good entertaining film if you feel like sitting back in a comfy chair without the need to think too hard.It's a welcome return to the old-style Allen of yesteryear. Not quite in the same league as Annie Hall or Manhattan, but neither does it quite fall in the same bracket as the slapstick extreme of  say Sleeper or Bananas to the more darker & impersonal September or H&W at the other.If you like the Old Allen then you're going to love this.***/***** "},{"Title":"Annie's Other Doors","Date":"23 January 2008","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery","Review":" One of the greatest pleasures I have in film is imagining - and therefore internally watching &#151; films that aren't there.

Also in this category are films that you know the filmmaker had in mind, perhaps great films, but that because of lack or talent, skill or resources came through imperfect.Its a sort of detective story, a sort of scholarship into uninstanced imagination. One of the most interesting of these is the missing mystery in Annie Hall. It was originally envisioned as a massive collection of narrative devices, a survey of storytelling tricks, each one elaborated cinematically and perhaps folded into some of the others. We know from Woody since that he is meticulous in his examination and categorization of these effects, and apparently he had too much to cover. So (as the story goes) his producer and some friends who form valued counsel talked him into jettisoning the mystery and editing to a romance.What we ended up with is a relatively coherent collection of introspective narrative devices. But we wonder what the mystery was and how it could have fit in. Supposedly the missing piece has been reworked for this. It also is a tour of noir reversals and cinematic tricks. Its not as clever. Its not as coherent. Its not as invisible, which is what you want in a Woody project.

Our Woody initially thinks his better half is crazy to suspect such a nice, stamp-collecting avuncular chap, but as the evidence mounts and she gains recruits to her cause from their circle of friends, Woody starts to assist her...not giving away too much here, but the resolution and Woody's involvement in it should produce a satisfying mental 'click' in your brain.Woody at his best, but let me first get some negative energy out of my system...I found Diane Keaton and Alan Alda a tad weak...Keaton's 'maladjusted rich girl now nearing 50' routine and Alda's constant dirty leers in her direction got a little tiring after a few viewings. I didn't know Alda until this film, and when I saw an 1974 ep of Mash recently, and I'm amazed at how little he changed physically over two decades.On the positive, Anjelica Huston and Woody are a breeze, both together and with anyone else.

Here the story concerns a middle aged Manhattan couple who become involved in the death of the wife of their across-the-hall neighbor. Keaton, as Allen's wife, becomes more and more suspicious about the death and starts to play amateur detective, much to the wise-cracking Woody's dismay. (my favorite line There's nothing wrong with you a little Prozac and a polo mallet can't fix.).Despite Woody's humorous presence, the story never evolves from a murder mystery into the expected zany Allen adventure. There are no tricks or plot surprises here; rather, the story settles into an actual (and rather mundane) murder mystery, enlivened only by Woody's witty lines and a lame love interest between Keaton and Alda. There is an actual suspenseful plot culmination which seems gratingly out of place in an Allen comedy, and the close of the movie seems to stop rather than end. All in all, a subpar effort from the Woodmeister.

There are his movies that, in theme and structure, seem very similar to me, like Manhattan, Annie Hall and Whatever Works, which also were the movies that first introduced me to his filmography. The awkwardness of his main characters never really struck a chord with me, which is the main gripe I had upon viewing Manahattan Murder Mystery.The alliterative title intrigued me as it suggests a movie in the crime/thriller genre. Hoping this movie wouldn't fall into his usual comedy/romance/drama type of film I was soon very disappointed to find familiar romantic themes like jealousy, infidelity and the resulting, reoccurring matrimonial arguments at the center of the movie rather than a thought-provoking plot. Even though the main characters, Larry and Carol, take on the task of resolving the case of a suspected murder by their neighbor, the film never quite feels like a crime movie. The camera puts the viewer right at the center of the investigation while we watch the scenes unfold from behind of a flowerpot, through a door-frame or a rainy car window. But, unfortunately, the camera not only zooms in on the suspects but more frequently sways to and fro between our main characters during their relentless arguments. While Woody Allen again plays the same role he most often appears to play, I found his hectic, gibberish talking and awkward gestures more off-putting and overdone than in his other movies. By comparison, Dian Keaton's role as Carol was more compelling as, for example, compared to the moment Allen proclaims at the height of the action Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears! in the same monotone voice he uses while talking in the conjugal bed. Other common Woody Allen themes are present. Like the title suggests the film takes place in his beloved New York and of course classic movies (e.g. Double Indemnity) appear and are discussed, which I always enjoy about his works. Furthermore, some of the major scenes take place in a cinema which serves as a good setting and is a welcome sight after witnessing tiring disputes in their apartment. After many a quarrel about their further procedure to solve the case and clumsy investigations, that, for me, failed to attach a comedic aspect to the movie the story reaches a rather anticlimactic finale after which the case is rapidly summed up for the viewer.While I like many Allen movies like Zelig, Match Point and Sweet and Lowdown that differ from his generic formula. Sadly, Manhattan Murder Mystery, for me, was not one of them. If you are a fan of his works chances are you will like this movie, but, in my opinion, it is neither a funny comedy nor a gripping thriller. Still I will keep on working my way through his films in hope for another one or two positive surprises.

And of course, although reviewers loved this movie, it was far from a success with picturegoers. Even accounting for TV and video sales, it would have been lucky to break even.

It's close to being a slew of MacGuffins, or something out of a Thin Man movie. But knowing more about Allen's personal history during the period there's an awful lot of subtext to the piece, scenes where the more conventional aspects of the story are stripped away and we see the bare emotions of these characters in their marriage. It's not as harsh and astounding a view as with Husbands and Wives, but there is something that made it more substantial than I would've expected- behind the comedy, which isn't at all third-tier Allen work and is often pretty funny, and which represents a kind of movie level of Allen entertainment, the tension and doubt in Larry and Carol's relationship is hard to count out as more than just a part of the story.Not that I would ever expect Allen to rip open the covers on his personal life and use that for fodder for his movies, far from it (although, to be fair, I'm sure as any auteur he goes back to themes that impact him from his own life or at least movies he connects with). But it's something that makes Manhattan Murder Mystery feel like more than just a trifle, a throwaway treat to his fans that in comparison to the recent Scoop feels a lot more like a good slice of fun murder mystery. Larry and Carol have a neighbor that the latter suspect murdered his wife and covered it up in 'perfect-crime' style, and who can blame her with all the signs that seem to be appearing to her. Larry wants none of it, to just leave well alone, but she can't and involves her close friend Ted (Alan Alda) into the self-made investigation. Meanwhile one of book publisher Larry's new clients, author Marcia (Huston) might be catching his eye, though not on immediate sight. Eventually though they both get equally wrapped up in the case as it unfolds with more twists than the average pretzel stand.Many lines here work well (i.e. Wagner joke, jokey wife-beating-with-a-pole one-liner, menopause, jokes about movies themselves like Double Indemnity and Casablanca), and are indeed probably what one could call carry-overs; the script was originally part of a longer draft of what was, in all matter of fact, Annie Hall (the characters of Larry and Carol are like older and still more than a bit nuts couple Annie and Alvy), and contains some nuggets of gold involving Allen's classic persona, Keaton's excited heroine, and some very clever in-jokes. The best of the in-jokes is, of course, the climax that's a play on the climax of the Lady from Shanghai. As a comedy Manhattan Murder Myster works fine, not as a great film from the Woodman and not as anything less than a solid stab (pun intended) at making a whodunit out of old Hollywood and timing from vintage 70s Allen. As a personal effort, one that came as the first film following the break-up from Farrow and (possibly) the last team up of Allen with Keaton, it grows even more interesting as it goes along.

With a glittering history of successful comedies, the man is a natural born comedian. In 1993 he reunited with Annie Hall star Diane Keaton to write and star in this familiar comedy which, whilst not his finest work, is still fun to watch.Larry and Carol Lipton (Allen and Keaton) are a happily married couple who return home one day to be invited in for drinks with their neighbours, Paul and Lillian House (Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen). Enjoying their time with their new friends, Larry and Carol are stunned to discover the following day that Lillian has had a heart attack and died. As events unfold however, Carol begins to suspect foul play and enlisting friend Ted (Alan Alda), she sets out to solve the case.Actually dating for a long time, there's little surprise to see so much chemistry between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Playing off each other's personalities, both actors always thrive when they work together. Just like in Annie Hall (1977), they both perform admirably as the married couple who find their marriage unravelling as he fails to appreciate her concerns.In support as well, Alda and Angelica Huston are brilliant as the separate objects of desire for both Allen and Keaton. Providing a jealous edge to the marriage, these two actors flirt and joke their way through much of the film.Ultimately though, what makes the finest Woody Allen films truly amazing is the flow of the story. In films like Sleeper and Annie Hall, Allen is a genius at combining the fast paced and the slow into one story and making them connect with ease. In Manhatten Murder Mystery though, the story is let down by an awkward scene in a lift and in the pitch black where the music and the acting create a faster pace which just doesn't belong in the film. The scene is crucial to the story, there is no denying that, but sadly it could have been handled better.Throughout his films, Woody Allen is always a comedy genius. Making us laugh from start to finish, he is witty and sarcastic and we love him for it. Sadly though, in Manhattan Murder Mystery his work is ruined by one short five minute piece which is awkward, excessively speedy, and frankly rather annoying. Without that scene, this film would be up there amongst his best, sadly with those irritating five minutes, it goes wrong.

He thinks that is how everybody lives, behaves and talks People live in nice apartments, eat out a lot, have nice friends who swap barbs. He opened up a bit by including four letter words and sexual references later, but this is part of his old school.The problem with this piece is that the thriller part has nowhere to go other than the track it is clearly on. Given that it doesn't seem to be anything other than a make-weight I have problems taking it seriously.

Keaton & Allen starred in two of the very best American romantic comedies of all time, Annie Hall and Manhattan.

The result is that the attempted repartee comes off as hollow and annoying chatter that goes absolutely nowhere.As their friends, veterans Angelica Huston and Alan Alda fare much better seizing all four of the amusing moments this movie has to offer.

He wisely didn't do this but the idea remained with him and he turned it into this movie.  The story is very light and totally detached from reality.  Allen is a Bob Hope-esque coward, mixing his fear and panic with one liners.  The story slows occasionally when it loses motion and gets bogged down, however when it is moving quickly with plenty of humour then you tend to forget how light the story is.  The conclusion is a little daft, but is a nice homage to `Lady from Shanghai'.Allen and Keaton have a great partnership that hasn't faded with time.  They are both good but Allen's coward is by far the more enjoyable.  Alan Alda puts in one of his best roles for ages and is really relaxed, witty and charismatic.  Huston is underused but is still good.  Jerry Alder is also good, but doesn't convincingly change towards the end.Overall this is a nice, light film that sees Allen trying to lighten his image and do more comedy again.  It's not as funny as his 1970's stuff, but then it's a lot more structured and less surreal to boot.

When Alan Alda and Anjelica Houston enter the scene, the contrast between professional delivery of scripted lines and ad-libbed(?) banalities is jarring.It wouldn't have taken a Hitchcock to develop this small murder plot into a good, if minor, suspense flick.  The mystery is why talent and resources were wasted on this .

Set in Manhattan with two hours of the nonstop stuttering repartee which is Allen's hallmark, MMM is not a great murder mystery or a great comedy or a great drama or a great anything. It is, however, all Woody in fine form as director, actor, and writer. A must see for Woody fans and an okay flick for others.

The storyline is so thin I think it's got anorectic, must be one of his worst films. I got so bored watching this film, my girlfriend fell asleep. We usually love Allen's films, but this is crap. I feel dizzy now. Think I need to sleep. Or watch something more stimulating at least. O.k. I must write more about how bad Woody Allen's acting is. So over the top. I want to hurt him.  "}]
