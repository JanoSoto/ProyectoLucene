Iron's has without question created one of the most brilliantly layered historical characterizations to ever grace the screen.He gets to the heart of the haughty Von Bulow and brings us as close to liking the man as anyone ever could.His performance rightly won Him an Oscar for Best Actor.  Just as engaging is Ron Silver's driven and hyper Alan Dershowitz. his performance of the great trail lawyer is facinatingly accurate. Having seen Dershowitz speak and meeting him afterwards it is very clear that Silver was able to capture even the smallest details of the man's movements,vocal inflections and dynamic rhetoric(Dersowitz himself claimed Silver used a tad too many hand gestures however!) The supporting cast is equally strong. Glenn Close narrates the film as the comatose Sunny Von Bulow and  appears in flashback during the events that lead to her coma. She captures Sunny's selfishness as well as her vulnerability. The great Uta Hagan appears as Sunny's maid and protector and give a performance worthy of her reputation. Barbet Schroeder slickly directs the film,not as a linier plot but as a series of flashbacks,moments and current incidents.  This is one of the few films that I cannot find a single flaw in.For direction,plot,characterization,writing..and Jeremy Iron's wonderful performance this film is an absolute 10!

Dershowitz, who loves being in the limelight almost as much as he loves the law, took on the task of saving Claus Von Bulow from prison for the attempted murder of his rich wife initially as a means of raising money to help him in his pro bono cases. The rather heavy-handed manner in which we are advised of this should not detract from Dershowitz's work. The irony is that as the case developed Dershowitz became persuaded that Claus was innocent.Whether Dershowitz convinced himself of Von Bulow's innocence to assuage a possibly guilty conscience is a good question. Remember Dershowitz is the guy who said after the O.J. Simpson trial (he was one of Simpson's lawyers) that he didn't know whether Simpson was guilty or not. While that may be a good stance for a defense attorney, it is an insincere one for the public figure that Dershowitz has become.Starring as Dershowitz is Ron Silver in an uneven performance that at times made me think of Gabe Kaplan doing a young and uncomedic Groucho Marx. I wonder if Dershowitz was entirely flattered. Director Barbet Schroeder (Barfly 1987; Single White Female 1992) uses several points of view to tell the story, including a voice-over from Glenn Close's Sunny Von Bulow as she lies comatose, but also from recollections by Jeremy Irons' Claus Von Bulow. We see some scenes twice, colored by the differing points of view. This technique is entirely appropriate since what really happened is far from clear to this day. It is Claus Von Bulow's fortune that was reversed. Whether the first two juries or the third were right is something Schroeder leaves for the audience to determine.But make no mistake about it the heart of the movie is Jeremy Irons' Oscar-winning performance. His subtle artistry based on a deep conception (true to life or not) of the aristocratic and Germanic Claus allowed him to create a persona that is cold and aloft, yet somehow sympathetic. The contrast with Silver's Brooklyn-born hyper-energetic Dershowitz made for some good cinematic chemistry, although sometimes it came across like nice Jewish boy defends a vampire.Glenn Close's flawless rendition of the idle, drug-befouled Sunny reminds us once again that she is a great actress. Unfortunately I don't think Schroeder spent as much time and energy as he should have with the people who played Dershowitz's law students. They seemed amateurish and unconvincing in just about every scene. And there were too many of them--law students, that is. Some distillation of intent, and more directorial guidance might have helped.Nicholas Kazan's script has a number of good lines in it, not the least of which is this Dershowitz You are a very strange man. Claus Von Bulow You have no idea. Also nice was Von Bulow's observation after they are seated in the restaurant and after the waiter has called him Doctor Von Bulow When I was married to Sunny, we never got this table. Now, two injections of insulin and I'm a doctor. Indeed it is partly Kazan's snappy, comedic and self-revelatory lines that humanize Claus Von Bulow's character and persuade us that he could very well be innocent.While I like Dershowitz's self-serving style and his confidence, what I admire most about the man is his realistic conception of the defense attorney's role in our society and his idea of what makes a good lawyer; that is, a good lawyer is one who recognizes not only that every person deserves the best defense their resources allow, but that he himself deserves to defend those with the best resources.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

It is trite but true; money has not brought happiness to either of these people. Sonny has apparently led a life of depression, eating disorders, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse. Claus was probably no stranger to similar vices, as well as episodic infidelity. It may have been even more interesting had the screenplay delved into their earlier years, lifestyles in Europe and world travel, living a hedonistic life.In this case, murder is a nebulous concept. Claus von Bulow insists he is innocent, yet his many assertions to attorney Alan Dershowitz indicate otherwise. von Bulow is calculating, mysterious, and cold. Does this indicate guilt? The audience is never completely informed. That is what makes the story so real. As in real life, when murderers are set free, one may never know the truth. There is also a good side-story where Dershowitz is attempting to save two young black males from a death sentence. He does their case pro bono, for the sake of justice, whereas von Bulow's case, as Dershowitz proclaims, is paying for their defense.Overall, this is a tragic story which leaves many grey areas, one wonders how the children, Alex and Alah have survived this debacle. Another viewpoint would be an interesting screenplay. 10/10.Dershowitz is portrayed by Ron Silver, who projects a realistic image. "},{"Title":"A delightful movie.

The tactics used by Dershowitz were very convincing and plausible. One thing I must complain about was the addition of Sarah's relationship with Alan into the film, which wasn't very well done.

Claus needs a lawyer to appeal so he contacts a stereo-typical Jewish lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, played incredibly by Ron Silver. Alan takes on Claus' case even though he believes him to be guilty and Alan and his team try to prove him innocent.

Did he - Claus von Bulow - murder his wife, or didn't he? After watching this film a decade ago, I still wasn't sure. The story is a fascinating one and the movie is well-done, too. Was the story biased? Probably since it comes from a book written by attorney shown in the movie but, as someone who mainly knows the story only from this film, I am not qualified to say how much of this is truth, fiction and/or bias. Nonetheless, I am usually intrigued with character studies, another reason I liked this movie.I only know the story was interesting and Jeremy Irons as von Bulow; and Glenn Close his wife Sunny, and Ron Silver as attorney Alan Dershowitz, were all fascinating to me, all turning in fine performances. It's ironic that Silver, who played mostly sleazy characters in this timer period, played a law professor. It was appropriate casting. Irons won an Oscar for his effort and is obviously the focus of the story.The only thing I warn viewers is not to be duped by the message in there that you can't ever know the truth, everything is relative, etc. This is nonsense and the kind of psycho-babble defense lawyers love to spew. What's sad is that all the education in the world, Dershowitz proves here, means nothing if you don't realize there ARE absolutes in the world. Yes, Alan, murder is wrong that's a black-and-white issue. I'll bet this lawyer would have loved to be on the O.J. Simpson trial, too, and would have had no qualms helping his get a not guilty verdict. So, enjoy the fine performances in this film but take things with a grain of salt because this story is definitely biased.

The movie was about the appeal of Claus von Bulow who was convicted of attempting to murder his wife, Sunny.  The movie only eluded to Claus's innocence and never revealed the events that actually took place.  Although there were speculations about how Sunny fell into her coma, the truth will never be known.  The truth is only relative and favorable to the storyteller.  The purpose of the appeal was to show that Claus couldn't be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Alan Dershowitz, Claus's appeal lawyer, did this by disproving the theory of the prosecutors.  The reason Alan Dershowitz took the case wasn't because he believed Claus was guilty or innocent.  He defended Claus because he disagreed with the idea that the wealthy can hire their own prosecutors, which allows them to decide what evidence should be used.  Dershowitz hired a team of people to disprove every aspect of the prosecutors theory on how Claus attempted to murder Sunny.  In conclusion, this was a good movie because it allows the viewer to convict or acquit Claus according to their speculations.

If you were to roll your eyes and turn it off there, you'd miss a dryly funny, creepy, sad movie based on a nonfiction legal procedural... which is pretty bizarre in and of itself. This view into the lives of the idle rich is stunning.The movie is narrated by Sunny von Bulow from her coma, which is only the second time I've seen a device like this used. (Sunset Blvd you'll recall, has an atypical narrator). People take issue with the narration, but I found the conceit to be the reason the movie grabbed my attention. Sunny's narration haunts the characters. Her august, bitter pronouncements lend the movie a compelling tone, which she and the movie wouldn't have if she was limited to just living scenes. The freedom the creative team feels in adapting a non-fiction news item is exhilarating Narrating from a coma? A ghost-cam? A funny docu-drama about killing your wife? A deliberately chilly blue cast to the cinematography... Black humor from Irons sounding like Boris Karloff... What a mash-up. It does makes me wonder how such an unflattering portrait of Sunny was allowed by her children. And Irons more than makes up for that early dud line with many acid subtle readings. Lastly the film has an eerie, amorphous score that is very nice.If I take issue with anything it's the Dershowitz (Ron Silver) portion of the film; which comprises a lesser, more sanctimonious product. With a diversity-approved team of coeds seemingly borrowed from 'the kids from Fame,' who generally give bad, uber-sincere performances that almost tank the movie.Ultimately a woman with unlimited freedom and money is nonetheless shown to be as deliriously unhappy as anyone else.

The film, of course, is based on the notorious von Bulow case. Sunny von Bulow was a socialite who became brain dead, and her husband, Claus, was accused of injecting her with insulin in an attempt to kill her. Sunny lived in a coma for nearly 28 years.Sunny (Close) herself narrates the story, beginning when Claus (Irons) calls Dershowitz and asks him to take his appeal. Dershowitz takes the case and involves his law students (including a very young Felicity Huffman) in it.It's all left pretty ambiguous - Sunny tells us that this is all we can know for now. Though von Bulow was found guilty of attempted murder at the first trial, Dershowitz won his appeal, and von Bulow was found not guilty at a second trial. After that, von Bulow moved to England. Since his daughter Cosima had taken his side in the case, Cosima's maternal grandmother disinherited her. In order to get her back in the will, von Bulow gave up any claim to Sunny's money.Glenn Close is excellent as the unhappy Sunny - a woman beset by health and weight problems as well as drug addiction and her husband's infidelity. But the backbone of the story is the character of Claus, and here Jeremy Irons does a fantastic job and deservedly received an Oscar for it. He is cold, unemotional, snobbish, and really makes you wonder if he did it or not.There are other good performances in the film, including that of Fisher Stevens as a supposed witness, the great Uta Hagen as Sunny's devoted maid, Christine Baranski as Claus' new girlfriend (I told him, get the Jew, she tells Dershowitz), and Julie Hagerty as Alexandra Isles.After the first trial, I transcribed an interview with one of the jurors, and boy, did he think Claus did it. Despite the second verdict, did he or didn't he is a shadow that will always hang over Claus von Bulow.

Every shot feels effortlessly dense. In every shot, one can see texture, whether it is in the landscape of a bedroom or a hotel room, or the structure of a man or woman's face. The cinematography is dark and gloomy. The story, as you likely know, as you have either seen the film, or have read the IMDb summary, is about Claus von Bulow, who has been accused of attempting to murder his wife twice, both times sending her into a coma, the first coma which lasts only a few hours, the second which lasted until 2008 and turned Sunny Bulow into a vegetable. The story is, as all good stories are, so multilayered that it seems to evolve as time goes along. Unlike most films made nowadays, and indeed most stories told in history, it is not linear and obvious. The story threatens to go in any direction at any time. All of the characters seem human, balancing on the line of their own soul and being, reaching out toward other people or retracting into themselves. The Main characters are Claus Von Bulow, Sunny Bulow, and Alan Dershowitz. They are each played by great actors. The film is expertly directed and represents each of these characters separate lives. The viewer sees each character as sympathetic but realizes at certain points throughout the film that the characters may have reached a turning point and made a bad choice or perverted their hearts goodness and done wrong towards another. The film has a lot of subtext. Though the characters do come out and state what they are thinking at various points, for the most part the film shows, not tells. Although all the actors do good jobs in this film, the crown must be placed on the head of Jeremy Irons, one of the greatest actors in history. Irons is often mocked for being very dense and inanimated, I personally think this is because most film watchers are used to actors who are less subtle and less skilled than Irons. His subtlety is extraordinary. This performance may be the most subtle in film history. The performance is mysterious and dark, unexpressibly creepy, but also sympathetic. At one point int he film(don't worry, this isn't a spoiler),Claus von Bulow leans slightly forward in a car, with his head almost completely in shadow and responds to Alan Dershowitz claim You are a strange man, with the words You have no idea. Irons is just brilliant. His performance must be seen. The film as a whole explores many theme, favoring emotion and thematic depth over bare bones plot. One of the more interesting themes is the idea that every moment is in the now, and so every human being is freshly born every minute and so they must be forgiven for wrong things they have done in the past. Another theme is the idea that no one truly knows another person, that all people have secrets, hidden characteristics and emotions that are hidden even to themselves as well as to other people. This is the theme I fell that this patient film expresses best. It is well paced and allows you to feel every scene before moving on to the next. The film also explores the importance of humor and the need for humor in humanity. This provides great unexpected moments throughout the film. This is one of my favorite films in history. It is so patient in the camera-work and performances. It feels like more than an interpretation. It feels like a reality or at least a possibility. This is a rare achievement. It is an uncategorizable experience, a great work of art, and a film of astonishing depth. It is one of the few that reaches the true depth of the soul. it does not only confirm something that other films have told us. It twists and turns, until the viewer and the film and the characters are all one. An excellent film.

Jeremy Irons gives a pitch-perfect reading of his character's cold, careless life of privilege, while Glenn Close plays the ill-fated Sunny von Bülow as a somewhat more pathetic variation of her psycho role in 'Fatal Attraction'. Her clumsy death-bed voice-over narration is an awkward attempt to balance the scales of justice, but in the end both the film and the legal case favor the defendant, with ace attorney Silver presenting his client as a public scapegoat for daring to fulfill every henpecked husband's darkest fantasy.

We are never really sure what he thinks and that's of course how the director told Irons to play it. Still, I can't help but think that Irons is too much aware of himself playing another person. If he had been playing a fictional character or someone who wasn't currently alive it would have been different. I think maybe he was too aware that Bülow was too much of a caricature's if he had played him as seen in interviews or elsewhere.The movie itself is pure entertainment and nothing more and on that note it delivers. It doesn't try to teach us that the rich are bad people, although the Dershowitz character's philosophy is certainly not aimed in favor of the rich. What it does is take a story which in real life was fascinating and one that producers just wouldn't have been able to resist. If it hadn't been made into a feature, TV producers would be standing in line to make Sunny Von Bülow mini-series or Claus and Sunny - the way we were but now aren't. The title of this movie is all the better for that very reason because I have never seen a title that could be interpreted in more ways than one and still not suck.

Barbet Schroeder, certainly a brilliant observer, seems to share this view and created a wonderfully stylized, finely crafted, superbly cast movie around the Claus von Bülow trial.Fotography, lighting and the set design really are of the first order. The main stage of the film is a big mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. I don't know how much of the movie was shot on location - in any case the place reminded me strongly of Manderly, the country home in Alfred Hitchcock&#145;s Rebecca. Somehow Sunny von Bülow, she is seen lying in her state of eternal coma and heard recounting events and musing about them in a voice over, is the mythical Rebecca Hinrich become flesh and blood in the most gruesome way imaginable.The home of the von Bülows has the feel of a funeral parlor. The most important room is Sunny von Bülow's private bathroom, the door of which is flanked by two porcelain busts on high pedestals, like some gate of doom. Despite the warm colors, the opulent furniture, the glossy surfaces (they seem to come out directly of an old fashioned women's magazine), it is deadly cold in the world of the von Bülows. The emotional detachment of the whole family - apparently even the children - is truly horrific. The most hilarious scene is ever expressionless Claus von Bülow joining his wife in the marital bed with a thick sweater, a scarf and a woolen cap (Sunny von Bülows insists on keeping the window open on principle even in freezing temperatures). He turns away from his wife and, as the last act before turning off the light, puts his earplugs in. Oh, and then there is law professor Dershowitz and his team. What has he got to do with this movie? Very little, I should say. The bubbly intellectualistic crowd occasionally allow the viewers to relax a little, but their sporadic intrusions into the circle of the von Bulows in no way counterbalance the weight and the frigid opulence that comes to dominate Reversal of Fortune.

One of the best scenes is when Dershowitz says to von Bulow, You are a very strange man, and he cocks his head and flatly answers, You have no idea.The movie works because it's never revealed whose side of the story is the truth.  A case is made against von Bulow that seems plausible, and his recollection of events seems equally plausible.  This approach eliminates the need to place value judgements on the characters and allows the viewer to just sit back and enjoy the performances.Besides Jeremy Irons, Ron Silver does an excellent job as Alan Dershowitz.  He plays the lawyer as more of a champion of the working class than the real life person we saw during the O.J. trial, which is a good thing.

It is not a straightforward linear institution in which those who are guilty are punished, and those who are innocent are freed, as most people believe it should be to maintain a healthy society. What most people don't realize is that because the justice system has become so large and complex with literally hundreds of crimes being committed every day and almost as many being tried in court, the entire institution is essentially a legalistic game. Acquittals or convictions are not necessarily the result of whether someone is truly innocent or guilty. Verdicts are the product of a host of other circumstances the strength of evidence against a suspect, the adeptness of the prosecution, the backgrounds of the jury, and, most importantly, the quality of a defendant's representation. After having been convicted of twice trying to murder his wife and multi-millionaire Sunny Von Bülow, Claus Von Bülow hired one of the best legal minds of the late 20th century, Alan Dershowitz, to handle his appeal.Reversal of Fortune (based on Dershowitz' book of the same name) is a dramatization of the circumstances surrounding the eventual vegetative state of Sunny Von Bülow, the indictment against her husband Claus Von Bülow, his first trial in which he was convicted, and the stunning appeal in which the Supreme Court of Rhode Island overturned the lower court's conviction thereby awarding the defendant a new trial. Aside from the melodrama between Claus and Sunny and the events leading up to Sunny's coma, a hefty portion of the film is devoted to the case on appeal. Defense lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, played by the late Ron Silver in one of his best performances, is the captain of a makeshift law-firm comprised of law students who will get their first taste of an actual case. As interesting as the flashbacks involving Claus, Sunny, their children, and some of Claus' love interests are, the scenes involving Dershowitz and the law students, and how they prepare the appeal are the most fascinating aspects of the film. Their meetings and discussions which involve dissecting the prosecution's case to find weaknesses demonstrate the behind-the-scenes preparations that occur before going into court. At one point, Dershowitz explains to his students that cases are won in the field and not the courtroom. The transcripts of the original trial become the basis by which Dershowitz' team destroys the prosecution's case. For example, the legal team go through minute details, such as syringes whose needles have insulin encrusted on them which were found at the crime scene. The students do research and are told by medical experts that dirty needles are inconsistent with injection because the skin acts as a swab and cleans the needle after injection. These are the kinds of minute details which end up having large legal implications that help determine the resulting verdict on appeal.What keeps the story moving is the outstanding acting. Jeremy Irons (in an Academy-Award-Winning performance) steals the show with his enigmatic performance of what Sunny considers not a normal person. Irons finds that strange combination of cool detachment and spontaneous passion, especially with regards to women. Over and over, Dershowitz tries without success to uncover who is client really is, aside from all the muck splashed in the tabloids. Ron Silver keeps up with Irons stride-for-stride, showing us Alan Dershowitz as the lawyer who is at first fascinated then all-consumed by the case. Glenn Close is completely believable as Sunny Von Bülow, the filthy rich heiress who likes pills, sweets, and lying in bed more than anything else. Honorable mention goes to the actors playing the students, some of whom have gone onto fine careers (both in acting and in law!) Apparently, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was one of Dershowitz' law students who worked on the case, although he does not appear to be mentioned by name in the film. A wonderful film overall, and a strange prelude to the OJ Simpson case of a few years later. The film has it all sex, murder, and legal corruption. How could you go wrong?

But even a guilty man deserves a fair trial, or so a committed legal scholar believes in a film about skewed viewpoints that plays with our own point of view.First-billed actor Glenn Close plays Sunny von Bülow in a bed for much of the film, either laid out in a druggy haze or in a full-fledged coma from which she tells us she won't emerge. That leaves Ron Silver as legal eagle Alan Dershowitz handling most of the action arranging a fresh defense for convicted murderer Claus von Bülow, whom Jeremy Irons plays with slick tragi-comic flair.Let the chips fall where they may! he tells Dershowitz when warned about the perils of seeking out the truth.That's what an innocent man would say, a skeptical Dersh replies.I know, says smug Claus with a lazy pull at his cigarette. Is he sincere, or playing a part?Director Barbet Schroeder seems to have a thing about the tricky ground where power and morality meet He made his name with a documentary of dictator Idi Amin that came in two versions, a friendlier one for Amin's domestic distribution in Uganda and a less guarded version for international distribution. Here he seems to enjoy his proximity to another devil, albeit one who may be innocent after all.We certainly root for Claus, mainly because Irons plays him in a way that makes him an underdog, whether against the legal system or Dershowitz's team of young lawyers who mock him about his sex life. We can't all be like you, he tells Dershowitz after the latter goes off on him for his lack of apparent concern about his vegetative wife, and there's a trace of real feeling in his line reading.He seems less a cold-blooded killer than the emotionally-stunted product of a rich society, in a way not much different from poor Sunny. She wants to lie in bed smoking and pill-popping while he wants a career, not to mention a little time with a pretty soap-opera actress. You marry me for my money, then you demand to work, she huffs. You're the prince of perversion.We are encouraged to see him that way, too, although not necessarily a criminal one. He lives a life so far removed from normal human interaction and concerns that he seems to enjoy his little jests even if no one else can - except the audience, which makes us a little perverse, too.Reversal Of Fortune has a lot of great moments, but plenty of duff ones, too. There's a subplot about a sleazy gadabout played with zest by Fisher Stevens that never gels with the main story, and neither does an attempt at shoehorning some romance for Dershowitz with one of his assistants. Nicholas Kazan delivers a smart script but does get stuck in the weeds trying to get across a good deal of information.Silver is great though, giving pound for pound the film's best performance even if Close is first-billed and Irons won the Best Actor Oscar. You need a center for a film like this, and someone who's morally grounded, but Dershowitz is presented as that here only in a relative sense. He not only takes Claus's case despite his belief of his guilt, but can even joke about wanting to defend Hitler in a court of law, just so he can kill him after by himself.Is Dershowitz the film's real prince of perversion? Schroeder and crew aren't saying, but you can tell they're having fun making you think.

Thus I was pleasantly surprised that it isn't really courtroom bound; the film consists mostly of famous lawyer Alan Dershowitz working on his latest case which the audience is familiarized with through the generous use of flashbacks. The film is concerned with a rich woman who is in a coma following an overdose of some kind. Her less wealthy husband has already been convicted of her murder and it's up to Dershowitz and his crew of student aides to overturn this conviction in a higher court.The film is diverting enough not to be a drag but it isn't particularly memorable. The main flaw is the narration from the comatose woman that adds nothing and doesn't mesh with the sober tone of the rest of the film. The apparent purpose of this framing narration is to give the victim (and actress Glenn Close) more screen time but this throws off the pacing in a few spots. Still, the film seems to do a fairly good job of covering the facts "},{"Title":"Still a classic film!","Date":"18 July 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Mystery","Review":" First, Jeremy Irons (when will he get Knighted by the Queen for his services?) is brilliant as Claus Von Bulow, a chilly, complicated, man to begin with and even likable portrayed by Irons. Von Bulow is suspected of putting his wife, Sunny, into a coma at their Newport cottage which is an enormous estate in Rhode Island. Sunny is portrayed beautifully and wonderfully by Glenn Close, she deserved to have been nominated for Best Actress in this role. Both Close and Irons are truly believable as a couple who fall in love together. Unfortunately, Sunny was born into her wealth and never had much interest in anything other than going to bed all day. Not that she had a sexual problem, her husband sought out sexual contact with call girls before turning his attention to a soap opera actress, Alexandra Iles portrayed by the under-rated Julie Hagerty. They didn't show much of her or their relationship. As far as Sunny regarded, it was nothing more than sexual. Sunny's problems were consumed by her hypoglycemia, smoking 3 packs of cigarettes a day, and her pills. If you watch this film, Alan Dershowitz is played well by Ron Silver. His supporting team of young lawyers include actors such as Felicity Huffman, Annabella Sciorra, and Ian Lithgow. As the film proceeds, Fisher Stevens plays a minor but a pivotal role in this film. The flashbacks allow us to see the couple mostly in bed discussing or arguing about CLaus wanting a job to have some purpose in life. Poor Sunny, she never seemed to have a purpose in life but being wealthy. She never had any hobbies, friends, or anything to do but smoke and take her pills. She was slowly killing herself even though Claus says Nobody shakes Sunny. I also forgot to mention the role of Maria played perfectly by the legendary actress Uta Hagen. This casting was perfect not to mention Claus' girlfriend played Christine Baranski. I loved the flashback scene where Claus and Sunny are playing with a tiger. Close is beautiful in that scene. The costumers and make-up artists did a fantastic job in allowing Sunny and Claus to grow old. When you finish watching this film, you could argue all you want but you can make your own conclusions about what happened.

He is snake-like, and pampered in that way the rich are used to.  He has a constant tan, as though he sheds his skins once a month.  He has also been found guilty of trying to murder his wife Sunny. He makes jokes at his own expense, is completely unfeeling and unemotional, and in general makes people feel ill at ease.  Its an interesting choice for an Oscar, in that he has no 'big' moments, or scenes where he reveals a soul.  He's pretty consistently slimey, and Jeremy is well-deserving of the Best Actor Oscar.  Ron Silver is also excellent as Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer Von Bulow hires to handle his appeal.  Silver is probably on-screen as much as Irons, which works since its not the life story of a couple of miserable rich people, but the story of a law suit.

And this is a legal picture that's a little different from others it stays away from the courtroom drama scenes and most focuses on the behind the scenes legal theory and work by Claus's defense team which was headed by famed defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz(Ron Silver)and a group of his former students that he taught at college. The story is compelling and interesting as this happened not once but twice as Claus was convicted of twice trying to kill his elegant socialite wife Sunny(Glenn Close)and Claus is a spoiled playboy a guy who has a mistress on the side, yet still Sunny had a drug and alcohol problem, and the way the film shows the scenes it leaves it up in the air as to whether Claus gave Sunny the dose or did she overdose herself in a suicide attempt? As questions still linger at what happened at this 1980 Newport mansion.The film is also based on defense lawyer Dershowitz's book as I mentioned most of the picture on the other story side is a focus of the legal work and theory put forward by Alan and his legal team of ex law students and current students waiting to pass the bar. It's really like a legal theory classroom showcase! All in all the film is a catch with interest it still has a drama suspense feel to it as after I watched I still asked the questions did Claus do it or not? Reversal of Fortune is one legal theory movie to watch.

Against all the odds to his trial, Claus hires Alan Dershowitz (Silver) as his defence and eventually gets away with the indictment while the truth remains a moot point. In real life Sunny died in 2008 after almost 28 years as a human vegetable and Alan would be involved as an appellate adviser in another notorious case of O.J. Simpson. Adapted by Nicholas Kazan from Dershowitz's 1985 book REVERSAL OF FORTUNE INSIDE THE VON BÜLOW CASE, the film is directed by Franco-Swiss director Barbet Schroeder as the follow-up of BARFLY (1987), when he firstly took a stab in Hollywood. Overall, the film garners 3 Oscar nominations including BEST DIRECTOR for Schroeder and ADAPTED SCREENPLAY for Kazan, plus a substantial win for Irons in the BEST LEADING ACTOR race. So, let's discuss Irons' performance first, wearing a bald wig, Irons' Claus establishes his ambiguity through his Englishman suaveness (from both his style of intonation and vague slyness in his demeanour) and an outward moral superiority. It is a perfect exemplar of his screen persona, fragilely lithe, intelligently elusive, and poisonously charming. In my book, he completes a more demanding and inspiring work in Cronenberg's DEAD RINGERS (1988, 7/10), but I have no qualm of his victory, however, it is patent that alongside a fertile career-path, he hasn't been invited back for another nomination since, which may partially bespeaks that the academy reckons his win is quite enough to acknowledge his versatility in a generous gesture. A much more perplexing case here is Glenn Close, who was on a hot streak in the 80s and conquered 5 Oscar nominations in 7 years, is completed snubbed here, one possible reason is the category misplacement, because Close is first-billed, thus she might be considered as a lead, however her screen-time is massively less than Irons and Silver (a very coincidental admixture), but she is superb as the rich woman who has nothing to live for, cannot be satisfied sexually and emotionally by her distant husband, stranded in the shore of aberrant medication, while Close manages to squeeze compassion out of the audience, simultaneously, her Sunny is a monstrous pain-in-the-neck to be around, Close influences great driving force for the film, not the least as the solemn voice-over narrating the story in a flashback structure, which brings about a verisimilitude of an uncanny experience where Sunny is coming back from her vegetative state. She is my current win in supporting actress race if there was any justice for her hallow prestige and consistent caliber. Ron Silver as Alan himself, represents a more mundane facade on the case - the legal activity, although his supposedly dialectical speech can barely be convincing when one of his student Minnie (a young Felicity Huffman) threats to quit because she thinks Claus is not innocent and they should not defence the perpetrator, since it is impossible to erase the whiff of money-grubbing in the process, so within all his movements, at least one part serves as a justification for a more self-seeking cause, which is the sad reality of the legislative system, not so far away in Satan's service. Performance-wise, Silver and Sciorra (as his fellow college Sarah) are a far cry from the elite group of Irons and Close, in any rate, viewers are not interested in their stories at all. In hindsight, the film is an adamant advocate in defying our conception of seeking the truth, truth only exists in those who are personally experienced in the particular event, as for outsiders, for the most part, we cannot get an unmitigated version of truth or whatsoever. Let's just forget the fanciful obsession and instead, try to reconcile with the world in a more pliable perspective, that is the spirit!

(She eventually died in 2008). Claus was accused of attempting to murder his wife by injecting her with insulin. The prosecution alleged that his motives were financial; his wife, an heiress in her own right, was considerably wealthier than him, and it was alleged that after her death he hoped to use her fortune to marry his mistress. At his first trial Claus was convicted and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment. This verdict was quashed on appeal, and he was subsequently acquitted in a second trial. There have been a number of good films, such as In the Name of the Father and Let Him Have It which have told the true stories of real-life miscarriages of justice, but Reversal of Fortune is not really a film of this type. As Claus von Bülow was eventually acquitted, the film-makers could not, without inviting a writ for libel, imply that he was guilty of the attempted murder, but for some reason they seemed equally unwilling to state definitively that he was innocent. (Possibly because they were unwilling to offend that large section of American public opinion which had taken a dislike to a supercilious European aristocrat and had judged him guilty). Consequently, we do not see very much of his life with Sunny (and what we do see is shown in flashback), and we see nothing of the first trial in which he was convicted. Jeremy Irons was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of von Bülow, although I have never understood why. It is not in my view Irons' best performance; he has given better ones in The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Mission, which came before Reversal of Fortune, and in the likes of Waterland, The House of the Spirits, and even Damage, which came after it. None of these films even brought him a nomination. Nor in my view was this the best acting performance in 1990; that to my mind was Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves, although Gerard Depardieu might also have had a claim for Cyrano. The Academy, however, doubtless felt that Costner would have to be content with Best Picture and Best Director and that to give him a third award might make him big-headed. As for Depardieu, the Academy has always had a bias in favour of American movies and against foreign ones, especially foreign-language ones. (In 1990 no actor had ever won Best Actor for a foreign-language performance). Irons' performance here is not a bad one, but it is to my way of thinking too one-dimensional to be worthy of an Oscar. He plays von Bülow as a cold, self-absorbed individual, speaking throughout in the sort of aristocratic British accent that today even most British aristocrats would find a bit too fruity for their tastes. (Although von Bülow was Danish by birth, he was educated in England). He never displays any real emotion; neither the tragic fate of a woman he once loved, nor the prospect of having to spend thirty years in jail, can rouse him to any display of feelings. Although the film never directly states that von Bülow was guilty as charged, we never feel for him the sort of sympathy we would normally feel for a man wrongly accused, and on an emotional level it would be all too easy to visualise Irons' character as a man quite capable of trying to murder his wife for her money. Indeed, in many ways the film is more about von Bülow's lawyer Alan Dershowitz than it is about von Bülow. (This is not surprising, given that it was based upon Dershowitz's book about the case). Dershowitz is portrayed as a left-liberal radical lawyer, who takes the case less because he is convinced of his client's innocence but because he believes that important principles of law, particularly those relating to the admissibility of evidence, are at stake. The film concentrates upon the appeal proceedings in which Dershowitz persuaded the Rhode Island court of appeals to overturn the original conviction, but appeal hearings, which largely deal with technical points of law, do not generally make for great excitement, and the chance to make the film a courtroom drama was passed up. Unfortunately, the film does not find any alternative sources of excitement. The story is too slow-moving for my liking and the overall emotional temperature is far too cool. Whereas in films like In the Name of the Father and Let Him Have It I could empathise with the plights of Gerry Conlan and Derek Bentley, in Reversal of Fortune I ended up not caring whether von Bülow was acquitted or not. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Dramatization of a True Story","Date":"10 July 2010","Score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Mystery","Review":" On 27 December 1979, the millionaire Sunny von Bülow (Glenn Close) is found in coma for the second time in her bathroom with an overdose of insulin.

Faced with a client who he obviously believes is probably guilty, Dershowitz resorts to one of the least respected of all legal tactics blaming the victim. The film - co-written by Dershowitz - degenerates from a rather ordinary legal drama into an endless series of attacks on the character of Sunny von Bulow, who, being in a coma, is hardly in any shape to defend herself. The film aggressively suggests that if Sunny von Bulow didn't cause her own misfortune, she certainly had it coming to her. Such a tactic is dangerous in a courtroom, because it can loose the jury's sympathy. But in a movie, especially one as one-sided and biased as this, it is a safe and even cowardly action. Watching this movie is like being allowed only to hear one side of the case. Anything damaging to Claus von Bulow is mentioned only if Dershowitz can rationalize it away; anything offered in defense of Sunny von Bulow's character (testimony or actions of friends and relatives) is rapidly discredited. But what moves the film from being merely a nasty, self-serving ego trip for Dershowitz into the realm of the utterly creep and despicable is the cinema trick of having Sunny offer testimony. Though comatose and vegetating in bed, Dershowitz and director Barbet Schroeder put words into Sunny's mouth, making her a totally unwilling voice-over witness in von Bulow's defense. Dershowitz could never get away with such a thing in a court of law, but he obviously has no moral qualms about manipulating history and reality to try to justify his own dubious legal integrity in the court of cinematic public opinion. The villain in Reversal of Fortune is not Claus von Bulow, who, as embodied by Jeremy Irons in a quirky one-note performance, seems to be his own worse enemy. The villain here is Dershowitz (and the legal system he represents) who seems to  believe winning - no matter what the cost - is more important than justice and feeding one's own ego is its own reward. The only saving grace in this callous film is that all involved are so shallow and unsympathetic one never really cares about the guilt or innocence of any of them.

Whoever wrote them told no lie.The movie is based on Alan Dershowtiz's book of the same title, where he takes on the appeal of the attempted murder conviction of socialite Klaus von Bulow, who allegedly tried to murder his wife Sunny through an injection of insulin. Dershowitz tells this to his group of college-age legal helpers, one of whom tries to drop out in disgust, but Dershowitz changes her mind by telling her that the idea is to get the money to continue their pro bono legal quest to help two young black ghetto kids who are also facing criminal charges. Dershowitz also mentions that the state of Rhode Island's judiciary has a corrupt legal system. Also, when they do a test of how liquid coats straws, it suggests that the evidence that von Bulow might have injected Sunny with insulin might not be so real after all.Jeremy Irons gives a good performance as an icy, haughty aristocrat, both in his scenes with Dershowitz and his legal team and with the flashback scenes with him and Sunny. Also, Dershowitz is shown as haughty and pompous in his own right, even if his heart is supposedly in the right place. And the movie does not make any conclusions as to whether von Bulow was guilty or not; no surprise when Dershowitz's tactic was to cast doubt on the evidence that his client actually made any attempt to kill his wife, even if he had a motive to do so. Indeed, the movie implies that Sunny had mental problems and was probably suicidal.Dershowitz might have wanted to come across as a hero doing his job. The latter is certainly true, but he has proved no more heroic than any other defense lawyer.

Dershowitz, defense attorney to the main suspect, Claus von Bülow. The film works as a solid little courtroom drama with an intriguing story, a clever script and an impressive cast; but it doesn't go the extra mile into something more than a daytime TV movie. It tries hard to break the mold - most notably, by having much of the film narrated by the victim - but at heart, it remains a very plain legal drama; and emotionally, it maintains a dry, distant coldness that doesn't allow the viewer to care about anything that's going on. That feeling of emotional disconnection leads to a film with a steady pace, with no highs and lows, and with no real climaxes or tension. In other words - rather dull, and unless you really pay attention to the details of the case, there's nothing much to grab onto.It's also worth mentioning that the film's poster, as well as Jeremy Irons's Oscar win, is more than a bit misleading, because Irons and Glenn Close aren't really the main characters, though the story revolves around them; and in fact Irons's performance is completely over-the-top and certainly not up to the standards he set two years earlier with his masterful work on Dead Ringers. The majority of the film revolves around Ron Silver, who plays Dershowitz himself; and while Silver's performance is understated and quiet, it's also the strongest one in the film. But it's just not enough to give it any emotional or moral weight and to keep the whole thing together, because the viewer doesn't care about Dershowitz winning or losing the trial any more then they do about Von Bülow being found guilty or not.

Basically Claus Von Bülow (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Jeremy Irons) is accused of attempting to murder his wife Martha 'Sunny' (Glenn Close), who has gone into a deep coma. Claus has hired brilliant Professor of law, Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver), to try and get him acquitted after being found guilty on two convictions. Through a series of flashbacks you find out how Claus and Sunny met each other, how their marriage was slowly breaking down, and a few flashes of how the accused incident could have gone. The only problem with Claus hiring Dershowitz is that he and his are students are confident that he is guilty, and they are actually trying to prove his innocence, and unbelievably, they succeeded! The end text says that Claus lived a reasonably normal life after he got off, and Sunny never woke from her coma. Also starring The Hand That Rocks the Cradle's Annabella Sciorra as Sarah, Uta Hagen as Maria - Sunny's Personal Maid, Fisher Stevens as David Marriott, Jack Gilpin as Peter MacIntosh - Dershowitz's Student Staff, Christine Baranski as Andrea Reynolds - Claus' Girlfriend, Stephen Mailer as Elon Dershowitz, Christine Dunford as Ellen and Desperate Housewives' Felicity Huffman as Minnie - Dershowitz's Student Staff. Irons makes an interesting performance with a slight German twang in his accent, Close (also narrating) does well in her flashback sequences, and Silver is pretty good, it is an interesting story worth watching. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Barbet Schroeder and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director and Best Screenplay.

He insists that he is innocent, and is determined to make his case. The story warrants attention. The downside of this movie is the legal team that represents Mr. Von Bulow. With the exception of Chuck, admirably played by that excellent character actor Alan Pottinger, Mr. Von Bulow's legal team are portrayed as a bunch of self-righteous dilettantes who treat this case like it's a game. Am I supposed to believe that this same legal team could convince a state court of appeals that a guilty verdict, duly arrived at, was wrong? What did the trial judge have to say about that? What I'm suggesting is that there is probably more to this story then what the movie portrayed. One is presumed innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

In isolation from the true story that inspired it, it holds very low impact and has not aged well in 25 years.Ron Silver is the film's strongest asset as Alan Dershowitz. He is the one who should have eaten up the accolades, not Jeremy Irons. His long philosophical rants are brilliant and gives us a very good understanding of Dershowitz as a thinker and a person in only a brief window of time. Glenn Close is also very impressive, shining in a very simple role. As for Irons, he has his moments - a smile here, a look there - that convey his talent, but for the overwhelming majority of time he isn't more than just a British gentleman. His performance in Eragon was more compelling than this. He is neither nuanced, nor malevolent, nary a shade on Primal Fear's Aaron Stampler or The Lincoln Lawyer's Louis Roulet. He is as dry as a bone, and to think that this film took the Academy Award for Best Actor which could have instead gone to James Caan for Misery or Ray Liotta for Goodfellas (neither of whom was even nominated) is just plain bizarre.The film is fairly predictable and unfolds pretty much as you'd think. It cuts away from the most exciting moments (the courtroom scenes) and even teases us with a far more exciting story (the two black brothers on death row).There's a fair bit of watchability here, which salvages an all right score, but there's a plethora of better films of this nature out there, and you should go an see them first.

The film allows an unconscious Glenn Close to narrate some of the past events, but her calm and sweet voice may lead the viewer to believe she finally found her place, like the William Holden character in Sunset Blvd.. Barbet Schroeder uses subjective flashbacks (which makes them not necessarily true), and we always adopt the lawyers point of view the book that was the source of this film was written by the real von Bulow's lawyer. The relationship established between the aristocrat and the lawyer is very subtle van Bulow's life depends on the lawyer's ability to succeed, and when the lawyer becomes sure of that, he attempts to eliminate class barriers, allowing himself to call the aristocrat for his first name and inviting him to his home. And yet, van Bulow is so intensely attached to his own way of life that he never loses his facade or temperament, and he says I don't carry my heart on my sleeves.Reversal of Fortune never attempts to find a climax its quality resides mostly on the ability of the viewer and in the mannerisms of the characters.

Glenn Close as Sunny is so-so, but Jeremy Irons as Claus is excellent.  The world of the rich and famous is screened effectively, and the plot, with and without legal twists, moves along well.I do not agree with those who say that this movie is even-handed.  It is clearly biased in favor of Claus as far as the principal charges against him.  However, this is only the beginning of attorney and director Alan Dershowitz's contamination of the film.  A disgusting, sleazy person in real life, Dershowitz manipulates the screenplay in line with his desire for self-serving, pompous ego gratification.  Also, remember that in real life he always criticizes those who oppose him of not telling the truth, in contrast to his absolutely truthful statement when asked by TV interviewers well after the trial whether his client O.J. Simpson was guilty of murder  I don't know.Dershowitz (played by Ron Silver) rationalizes his atypical representation of an affluent client (a lie anyway -- witness O.J., Mike Tyson, and Leona Helmsley) -- why not just say you are out for yourself, Alan?  This down-to-earth man of the people plays basketball with his students.  Of course, helping poor black kids falsely accused is worked in prominently, and Dershowitz ultimately tells Claus he has indirectly helped poor black kids by retaining him as his attorney.  Deeply moving, and Claus -- cares?  Dershowitz could not resist hamming up his impossible legal victory over a judge, citing the judge's own apparent contradictory ruling -- it was face-to-face with the judge, which is another of course.Nauseating scene  On the elevator, Dershowitz righteously (and yes, that is clearly the manner) tells Claus  Legally, you may be clear, but morally, I don't know.

After these two classics by two of the classiest directors, John Huston and Billy Wilder, Reversal was a huge downer. What's all the fuss about? First, I agree with the reviewer from Melbourne the script was as flat as a pancake (I can hardly imagine what Dershowitz's book must have been like), with dialogue that made the Stepford Wives seem animated. Second, with two award-winning stars like Irons and Close, how could a director fail? yet, for me, he did. These two actors could make the phone book sound interesting, yet they couldn't revive this dead horse. Why would an actor like Irons accept this role? For the money? well, you say, it won him the Academy Award. Granted, this role didn't cast the slightest shadow on his reputation, but it proves how important the script and the director are, once again. When one considers this film in the context of Asphalt, with its dead-on script, penetrating insight into the human condition and sterling (pun intended) performances by lesser known actors; and Witness, with its stylized and literate script, and its superstar cast (partially against character,making it all the more meaty), each bringing a lifetime of personality to the role, one can only say that the director oof Reversal, whose name I cannot remember, must have stifled his Newport cast with invisible pillows. Not only was the family dysfunctional, but the script gave nothing for even the children to do as part of daily life, except revive their mother time and again after being summoned by their robotic step-father. The only things alive in that Newport household were the maid, the Labradors, and that cute baby tiger, and their parts were too short.Irons usually brings his characteristic elegance of speech and manner to every role -- an obvious casting choice if one follows the von Bulow legacy of aristocratic achievement in music and the arts. But here, his attempt at a German accent is ludicrous and so mannered that it forces his face into an expressionless mask, interpreted by some as icy. The most one can make of this dramatic fault is that Irons considered this attitude to be the one von Bulow had with Sunny in real life. And it was enough to convince the Academy Award voters. That to me is the mysteryin this movie. When one see his other roles, from Brideshead to Kafka, one can only assume that he gritted his teeth and counted the incoming dollars. The same can be said for poor Glenn Close; she not only looked but behaved like a Stepford Wife in this role!Third, as for the Dershowitz family and the gaggle of Harvard students, every time there was a cut to their caucus, I thought the television set had inadvertantly switched channels and given me a TV sitcom. Ruffling papers, staring into computer screens, struggling with chopstiks, asking pointed questions of the defendant, and demonstrating dipped vs administered hypodermic needles is not my idea of acting. This part of the movie looked like a tryout on campus before they had cast the film.Of 4**** I give it a half*. One of the worst movies I've ever hadto suffer through.

It focuses on social relationships, character, and hypothetical scenarios, and somehow the legal issues get left behind. Not to say that the acting is bad. Of the principals, Glenn Close is as good as always, although her teasing narration from the other side of consciousness seems like a stunt. As Derschowitz, Ron Silver is intense and on the side of the angels. As von Bulow, Jeremy Irons' performance is sterling. Here, his face is bloodless and his expression serenely distant, as if noticing all this commotion were infra dig. He should legally change his last name to Irony. When English technical actors are good, they can be very good indeed. But the social relationships are shallow and tainted with class and ethnic stereotypes. The WASPS are snooty smokers, racist, supercilious, spiteful, polite, phony, calculating, lying . . . well, you get the picture. Von Bulow's new girlfriend (Klaus was born Bulow and acquired the aristocratic von somewhere along the way on his own) upon first meeting Dershowitz, smiles at Klaus and says, I told you. Get the Jew, didn't I? In the initial scene between von Bulow and Dershowitz, Wagner plays in the background, You-know-who's favorite composer and anti-Semite. The lawyer's team, in contrast, is down to earth; they cuss grandly, look and talk ethnic, listen to pop rock, eat spaghetti at home instead of delicacies at Delmonico's, laugh and argue together, and wear Levis and T shirts. There is more passion in one of their basketball games than there is in all the arguments between the von Bulows.Von Bulow is allowed to present his case, as he sees it, but is otherwise left a man of mystery. (The guy is still alive, probably goes to the movies, and undoubtedly has other lawyers at his disposal who know the definitions of highly legal terms such as slander and defamation of character.) When Klaus' wife Sonny first dallied with him, she was married to one of those Counts who have ten names, no paragon of rectitude herself. The structure of the film is rather complicated. The entire film is a flashback from her introduction, and at one point there is a flashback within a flashback within her flashback. Dershowitz on screen brims with chutzpah, although the real man has so much of it that he might not recognize its less endearing qualities. Of course his motives are entirely altruistic. He only takes cases that have important legal implications and charges astronomical fees in order to fund his pro bono work. (His hourly fee constitutes 56.2851782% of my monthly income.) In this instance, a pre-cop search was conducted by a PI hired by Sonny's family, and he turned up incriminating evidence. In one scene, Dershowitz explains passionately (he does everything with exuberance) that he wants to nip this kind of thing in the bud, otherwise the next thing you know, people claiming to be victims will all be conducting their own searches and it won't be limited to rich muckamucks like those who live in The Breakers either. Really? Why do I have such trouble visualizing an old couple in the ghetto who have been burglarized hiring a private investigator to track down the culprits and find incriminating evidence? Dershowitz in interviews has shown a staggering amount of intelligence, but, as with so many clever people with an agenda, he turns it into an instrument of justification for his own beliefs. All of his work seems in aid of the defense. Someone once said of him that he had a problem with authority. I wonder if he ever thought about that statement. Not that it's so difficult to understand. Wealthy people are as good or bad as the rest of us, I suppose. (Roosevelt and JFK were very wealthy; so were Reagan and Bush.) But what constantly surprises me (that's rhetorical, actually it doesn't) is that wealthy people spend so little time in the slams. Von Bulow, convicted by jury on two counts of attempted murder, is free to go yachting on a million dollars' bail. People like Michael Milliken and Ivan Boesky who bilk small-time investors out of tens of billions of dollars, weasel out of serving time by promising to turn over others and later, with the help of expensive lawyers, manage to renege. Let some inner-city dude with dreadlocks get caught rifling a neglected cash register for twenty bucks and see what happens to him. And I wish that at some point the film could have been stopped and a competent attorney come out and explain what was going on legally. As it is, the legal procedure is almost hurriedly skipped over. I did manage to get the point, however, that if you inject a fluid into a object like an orange or an arm and then withdraw the syringe, it doesn't come out coated with the injected substance. So since the syringe found at the crime scene was caked with insulin, it must have been treated and planted deliberately. But you know what? I'll bet that a nervous amateur giving an insulin injection might withdraw the syringe while a bit of insulin was left in it and might even continue squeezing the syringe so that some of the contents might dribble out and get all over the device. That would make someone seem guilty of attempted murder.But I'm just guessing offhandedly, so to speak, not being a Harvard professor or a famous attorney or an ethnic with a lot of stuff in the upper story or even particularly passionate about anything but pepperoni pizza, and at three hundred dollars an hour I could afford to eat thirty of them every hour.

We were actually able to bond with him.The sub-conscience narrating the story did give us a better sense of what actually happened and it was nice having the dual sides.  Overall, though, Sonny's character was monotonous.  The transitions between her and the story lines were jumpy and caused us to be pulled from the existing story line to a different view.We liked the joke Claus made at the very end of the movie, but we did not enjoy the overall ending of the movie, especially how it never gave any closure to the case.
