To begin with, the opening narration, although fantastic, is just about the best opening line to any story out there. It immediately draws one into the world of these weird, wonderful people. And that fantastic aspect is maintained throughout the film, like a fairy tale that provides a surprise around every corner. It is a pleasure to be taken into this kind of world for the 100+ minutes of the film.I strongly disagree with the comments, which the IMDb is currently (as of March 13/04) displaying as being representative, which statesIf you hold dear the innocence of children, respect God and those who serve Him, and hold dear what is beautiful in a spiritual sense, you will probably dislike this film.That's one seriously narrow-minded opinion the IMDb people have selected as being representative. There was a time when the IMDb was more discriminating in what they allowed through to the site. That they allowed *this* posting through *and* chose it to represent the average response to the film is bad a sign; the ship is sailing but there's nobody at the wheel. Reading those comments, one could easily conclude that there are a great deal of sadly unimaginative people out there who just don't get this film.It isn't surprising that someone with the kind of insular view of the world as expressed in those representative comments wouldn't enjoy this film. I never thought of it this way, but I suppose Antonia's Line is not for the polite, ultra-conservative, easily-offendable religious folks out there who, it seems, are more apt to feel threatened by fantastic stories like this than to appreciate them for what they are. Antonia's Line is the kind of story that give us permission to *imagine* how things might be if they were just slightly eschew. This film is not a picture of the real world, but, like a good fairy tale, provides one an opportunity to reflect on a variety of human conditions and experiences that everyone in some way can relate to.In this regard, Antonia's Line is a wonderfully rich and rewarding film, and a beautifully well-told story.It should not be dismissed so easily. (And the IMDb ought to get their act together.)

It is about Antonia and her line of descendents Danielle, Therese and Sarah. By rejecting stereotypes about the mentally ill, gay or other marginalized groups and accepting everyone for what they are, this family was able to find happiness in the face of hardship. Despite the despair of crooked finger, they prove that life is worth living. It is a complex movie. In the word of one of Therese's suitors, life is an intersection of relationships. The many relationships portrayed in this movie, most loving, some not, are what give it life and give the lives of these characters its meaning. I am a male and opponent of excessive political correctness. I was not offended in the least by this movie. The characters in it are wonderful. They happen to be mainly women, which is a refreshing change in a world where so often the female characters are only there as props for the male stars. I give it fourteen thumbs up!

See it, here's why","Date":"17 January 2000","Score":"35 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Rarely does a movie embrace life as fully as Antonia (also known Antonia's Line). It was the deserving winner of the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1995. Quirky, unexpected, funny, frightening, and ultimately beautiful, Antonia's line is a portrait of hope that successfully escapes being saccharine. There are moments of violence and despair, but beauty endures. It portrays 3 generations of independent women, and the matriarch of their unusual family, Antonia. Antonia left her small village before WWII and returns years later with her grown daughter. Antonia has an opinion on everything, and smiles as she points out the colorful village characters to her cosmopolitan artist daughter who is amused by everyone from the town busy-bodies to the tradition of drunk men peeing on the church wall. However, Antonia manages to carve out a place for herself by embracing love when she finds it, and opening her arms to the needy outcasts and oddballs that are victimized by cruel villagers.This film also offers a wonderfully refreshing depiction of love in all shapes and sizes-- connections between mentally handicapped loners, romance between women, elderly romance. It does not sensationalize these unusual couplings, rather it highlights the giddy delight that is two human beings connecting. This is truly a movie about self-made family, lonely souls that find each other and live together with loyalty. However, one graphic rape scene and a few other (naratively essential) scenes of violence make it inappropriate for young or sensitive children. It is overall, however, not gritty or depressing. Rather it is a portrait of hope made more real by addressing the presence of shadows.Both My life as a Dog and American Beauty are reminiscent of the kind of beauty and humor you can expect from this film.

Get it at Amazon.)This is an incredibly seductive movie with a strong sense of the spirit of Demeter and Dionysus throughout. There's no Hollywood glamour here. Instead we have an unabashed celebration of life (This is the only dance we dance) in which love, community and simple hard work prevail. The simple are seen as the equal of the gifted, and everybody (except for rapists and hypocrites) are appreciated for their strengths and forgiven their faults. Intellectualism is seen as quaint and unsocial (as in the person of Crooked Finger) possibly leading to a morbid cynicism. And brain power (as in the person of the prodigy Therese) is just another talent, like being able to laugh or to bale hay or to have lots of children.This is the Dionysian view of life that doesn't allow for Apollo, and there's a lot to be said for it. But I couldn't help but reflect that during the time span depicted in this movie--five generations in Holland during the twentieth century--Europe experienced some of the most horrific events known to humankind, two world wars, genocide, concentration camps, poison gas, fire bombings, political repression, and the death of millions of people. But perhaps that is director Marleen Gorris's point, to see life at its most elemental, locally and without the horror of war and the delusions of generals and politicians.What's not to like about that? Well, not to rain on anyone's love-fest, but we have vigilante justice here and a murder, seemingly justified and certainly agreeable to the audience since the victim was a brutal rapist. Men are not exactly banished, but they are put in their place, serving or (literally) servicing women. What is banished is orthodox religiosity in the form of a hypocritical cleric who (with his disciples, we are told) goes to town and becomes a social worker (!). This is also an ode to feminism and a deliberate tear-jerker that manipulates the emotions of the audience. Yet, somehow Gorris, who also wrote the script, manages not to offend my sensitivities. I think it is because the movie amounts to a very effective sermon against prejudice of any kind, and because of the gentle humanity of her tale.You'll forgive me, however, if I say that my favorite part was the handstand! It was just perfect.

Though Marleen Gorris' feminism is indeed apparent is indisputable.  But people who are not necessarily part of the feminist movement will still appreciate this film.  It is a more modern view of the independent woman, but I didn't see the political agenda of Gorris overpowering the film. It can be enjoyed as a simple fairy-tale (as declared by Gorris herself). The portrayal of women as independent and strong is definitely refreshing, but  those who claim this film makes a statement against religion and family aren't necessarily accurate.  the film covers these issues, showing women's strength in dealing with religious hypocrites and single motherhood, but I personally didn't feel the film was encouraging all women to leave the church or raise up families independently.

That's pretty much it, concerning what disturbed me as a sexist perspective on things. Violence is used by men and women (Danielle stabs Deedee's rapist in the crotch with a pitch fork - take that as symbolical if you want, for the character it is pretty literal) and respect and wisdom is shown by men and women. Women are the focus of the story, but men don't necessarily come off as monsters all together, only if you apply a very limited view to things. Some men are portrayed in a rather favorable light, those that respect the women and cheerily let them become parts of their own stories.After brushing aside a few pretensions, I was absolutely taken in by the easy-going way, these women (and men) successfully built an anarchic but peaceful community on their little farm. The way they just naturally picked up outcasts and lived the life that came to them... Homosexuality, mental handicaps, genius, love, birth and decay all come as parts of that big wonder of life which is celebrated in almost every scene. Only death and violent intrusions from outsiders occasionally disrupt the harmony on the farm but at least the former is, after a while, being accepted as another part of life and actually is what the movie begins and ends with, Antonia's recognition of her own impeding death and the sad event itself, between you get almost two hours of great, alternative and not really overly feminist fun. 9/10 "},{"Title":"the keys of life","Date":"12 December 2004","Score":"18 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Perhaps Antonia and her pink house unveiled for us the simplicity of the answer of those questions 'what is life?

It's tender treatment of family and community registers affectionately in the viewer's hearts. The film opens in medium close-up of an elderly woman(Antonia) accepting her dying fate with dignity and quiet resignation, and then dissolves fluidly into a flashback of Antonia and her free-spirited daughter Daniele returning to the rural town of their ancestry. The picturesque village fondly recalls the odd townsquare of Federico Fellini's Amarcord, complete with it's eccentric inhabitants. The villa boasts a howling woman named Madona an overzealous priest(Who leaves the church because 'he can't reconcile his enjoyment of life with the churches' enjoyment of death'); a cynical intellectual named Crooked Finger who steadfastly quotes from Shopenaur; and a dim-witted young man with the unbecoming sobriquet Looney Lips to name just a few. Antonia's Line, written and directed by Marleen Gorris(Mrs. Dalloway) celebrates the infinite possibility of life. The film, withstanding it's take on the afterlife(This is the only dance we dance) luxuriates in it's glowing affirmation of the present and the past. The main setting is the outdoors dinner table, where family and extended family measure their vision of life with laughter and temperance. Gorris views humanity as 'an intersection of perspectives', and some of the movie's best moments come from these subtle exchanges during dinner. Antonia's Line is filled with clever, fantastical imaginings, (Possible spoiler) from the loquacious grandmother rising abruptly in her coffin, to a well-aimed wing extending from an angelic statue. Throughout the film one sees more fanciful evidence and privately senses the director's fascination with the subversive filmmaking style of Louis Bunuel and his surreal mischievousness. (Possibile spoiler) Similar elements of fantasy pervade the film's final frames where the decease venture back and witness Antonia dancing joyously with her partner;a  scene  reminiscent of the finale in Fellini's 8 1/2. Gorris then cuts seamlessly to the present(Antonia-aged greatly- dancing the same dance) where the film began. Antonia's Line ends in great insight with the lines 'As this long tale comes to it's conclusion, nothing has come to an end. Something always remains,.........so life begins, without knowing where it came from or why it exists, because it wants to live'. The film's immodest achievements mark this as a major work from an ambitious and intriguing filmmaker.

This story has a woman named Antonia (Willeke Van Ammelrooy) who along with her daughter Danielle (Els Dottermans) come back to her Dutch village after the war to bury her dead mother. After that she stays and along the course of time different people come to live with them as it becomes a sort of commune run by Antonia. A retarded woman is getting raped and Danielle stabs the rapist with a pitchfork and the woman comes to live with them. As Danielle gets older she decides to get pregnant and Antonia takes her to the city to shop for the proper donor. One of the local farmers comes to court Antonia and asks her hand in marriage but she says no, but she also says he can do chores and once a week they will get together for sex. Danielle's daughter becomes a child genius and her teacher gives her extra lessons. Danielle and the teacher become lesbian lovers and form a strong relationship. The film has some truly dark moments like two rapes being depicted and one to a young girl. Gorris does an admiral job of letting the viewer get to know each character. This is not a 3 hour epic but when the film ends you have gotten to know every character pretty well. While we see Antonia and Danielle go to church, this film seems to relish the idea of getting together with people and exchanging ideas and thoughts. Antonia genuinely loves people and being around them at all times. Her spirit is evident from the first moment she appears on screen. As the film continues on we witness Antonia handing down her spirit to her daughter, then to her granddaughter, then to her great granddaughter. It even passes on to the other characters that come to live with her. The make-up is superb and towards the end of the film we see Antonia when she was younger and then a second later as she is as an 80 year old woman. Its a very good job and you don't notice the big change until that scene pops up. Good editing gives this film a nice flow to it and its beautifully lyrical.

I'm a man and I found this film admirable for giving a hoot about redressing a justified, legitimate grievance. Until very recently, women were not regarded as significant beings in their own right; they were deemed valuable only as helpmates to be utilized and governed by men - significant only to the extent that they were subordinate to a father and later a husband, and they were supposed to accept this secondary status without complaint, protest or challenge. Such traditional subjugation of women is rubbish and this movie plainly says so. That's a good thing. I see no reason to be offended by such truthfulness. These are not matters of conjecture but of historical fact.This movie features wonderful, strong female characters who are people in their own right - they are not compliant appendages of domineering male characters. Strong, independent women are found in cinema with extreme rarity, and this film has five of them! There are at least three male characters who are good human beings in this film Farmer Bas; Crooked Finger; and Simon; so you can forget the reviews falsely complaining that all the male characters are creeps. Refreshingly, this movie also celebrates sexual joy without censorship or hand-wringing. It's even quite amusing, bringing a life-affirming smile to the viewer's face despite some of the violent and somber events which occur in other parts of the film.I found Dennis Littrell's review on this web site to be excellent, because it cites the ancient mythological underpinnings of this film.The soundtrack is beautiful.I suggest paying especially careful attention to the conversations between older and younger female characters, because they contain a complex interplay of emotion, intelligence, belief and intuition - and so, just when you think you have a character pigeonholed (for example, Antonia is completely atheist), you notice a nuance pointing in another direction. Sarah's final pronouncement in the film also alludes to new possibilities, if you're listening carefully.A fabulous, unique film, Antonia's Line gets my highest recommendation.

The women rule here, even to the point of deciding to conceive by barter, by compulsion, and by taking arms against the macho power symbols of rape. All manner of variations of normal (spiritually possessed, moon howlers, disillusioned priests, mentally retarded, social outcasts) come under the influence of Antonia's strongly world-wise persona.

The fact that the women don't HAVE to have men in their lives to take care of them, but welcome them as equals and friends, is a refreshingly different take (especially when most movies still put forth the viewpoint that there is something wrong with you if you are not desperately searching for or paired off with a partner, preferably of the opposite sex). It's not meant to be a feminist anti-male polemic; I see it as a very well-told and slightly whimsical (in the vein of the magical realism of 'Like Water For Chocolate' and similar films) story of how an extended family of outsiders come together to care for each other.

My sense is that this film's director intended Antonia and her line of female descendants to represent strong, fearless heroines imbued with the fighting feminist spirit. I get this sense because most of the men in this film are brutes, buffoons or a combination of the two, and the women kick butt, make love to each other and tell all of the men off at regular intervals. This film is insulting to anyone who truly values feminist sensibilities in our movie culture. As so often happens, the makers of this movie equate strong with callous and emotionally distant. It's hard to care about Antonia and her relations because they all come across as either vacuous or heinous. Antonia's daughter casually chooses a complete stranger to impregnate her because she wants a child but doesn't want to have to deal with the father. Did she ever think that maybe the child would want a father. Is selfishness like this supposed to impress me with its strength of character?The script meanders from one incident to the next, characters you barely learn anything about appear and drop out of the movie listlessly, and the pacing of the whole thing is limpid. The film is only about 110 minutes long but feels much longer.I'm tired of the trend of thinking that propagates the belief that in order to be considered strong, women must prove that they can live entirely without men. That's such a juvenile attitude and serves no purpose. Callousness is callousness whether displayed by a man or a woman, and there's nothing weak about leaving yourself vulnerable to the complex relationships that spring between men and women. Of all the life lessons Antonia supposedly passes down to her ancestors, this is the one she forgot to include.Grade D+ "},{"Title":"Thoughtless, cliched hash.","Date":"5 August 2002","Score":"13 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This is the worst movie I have seen all year.

The Motion Picture Academy felt as strongly as I do, as they awarded it an Oscar; a well-deserved Oscar, I might add.It is about the progeny of Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy), a woman who returns to her village after WWII and begins life with her daughter Danielle (Els Dottermans). There is never any mention of a father. This is a feminist film in the purest sense. Men are not bashed, but there is a sense that they are not very useful, except for producing more daughters.Danielle seeks a male to impregnate her and bears a child prodigy, Thérèse (Carolien Spoor, Esther Vriesendorp, and Veerle van Overloop), Thérèse becomes a pupil of the town intellectual Crooked Finger (Mil Seghers) and cannot find a man who can satisfy her intellectually and physically, so she settles for the physical and has a daughter of her own.Men in this movie serve as seed bearers, or teachers, or comfort bearers, or, in one case, messengers of evil, as one manages to rape two women.But the film is not just about feminism, it is also about acceptance. Antonia never hesitates to give comfort and shelter to anyone in need, whether it bee someone with an intellectual disability, the raped sister, the woman who loves having babies, or the priest who finds that celebrating life is better than celebrating death.Her own daughter finds love in the arms of Thérèse's tutor, and this is not judged, only accepted as another part of life. Everyone seems to find love in Antonia's circle, and her real progeny is exceeded by those she touches with love and acceptance.It is a beautiful story with a wealth of interesting characters.

It's a foreign film, Dutch, and it provides a contemporary alternate point of reference for the many examples of mathematics involved cinema in American film. And what it tells Americans about their society, it's institutions of film and government, how they are seasoned with psychological, anti-intellectual propaganda is fascinating. Those conditions have their pronounced features for different historical reasons, geography, culture drift and the unique roll of the U.S. since WWII and of course the synergy between mathematics, war technology and the evolution of the Cold War to permanent information war. Part of that war you see has opened up a front specifically treating mathematics whereas it had long since considered the public and public education critical targets for softening and fluorochemical bombardment directly linked to today's epidemic mental retardation anomaly--The war not only against information, but the war against mind; and the staple brand manufacturing of the U.S. public educator as motion picture laughing stock in a devil may care, entertainment commercialized riot zone on what the electorate is supposed to keep throwing away its taxes and the students their disposable income, trend adoption, affected attitude, style, mannerisms and other grievously wasteful contaminations.The movie sets its own pace, follows the development of a little girl and her close-knit communal ties. Indeed it would appear that in the structuring of the mathematician here it does 'take a village'. And she turns out to become a remarkably gifted algebraist/group theorist of some kind. We could parallel this film through a procedure often employed in mathematics, what's called an Extension to another European movie Mindwalk, where we could imagine catching up to her after her career had gone through a government military closure working on SDI in physics. This is the woman the politician's friend takes him to see on Mt. San Michelle; and by this procedure of comparing biographical cinema in the sciences better appreciate its span and gender specification through the traditional underdog in the stereotypically male dominated arenas of math and science.For one thing, the main character isn't portrayed as crazy or mentally ill; if that's important in establishing the sharp contrast repetitively marring American genre in this same category. So the film is a great relief from the mental cruelty heaped on intellectual aspirations in a perennially bullied and sinking American educational decline, promoted through the mass industry of Hollywood film propagandas marketed as so called 'entertainment'. 'Buyer beware.' Not to bother comparing it with the far inferior movie 'Proof', even in the biographical abundance that would have been available to structure a film about John Nash, A Beautiful Mind, a wide ranging set of life experiences also caught up in Europe for an extended time, instead a hack biographer is selected to play up the crazy smear in order a distortion in film can be manufactured from that template. Chalkboard scenes are important litmus for calibrating the realism or contrivance, in Antonia's Line you have a far more natural setting, in the Nash film something completely different, i.e. yet another instance of 'throwing away the textbook', similar to the classroom setting in 'Dead Poets Society', and a storming of the lecture by an overzealous psychiatrist's Gestapo when Nash lectures on The Riemann Hypothesis. Induce, then blame the victim&#151;the usual knuckle-dragging monkeyshine's half-truths and characteristically feckless White lies. The American audience is dismissed as childish enough to have those sorts of overt propaganda coercions foisted on them without comment or feedback, what are really unqualified abuses of portrayal, demeaning to education and educators and really amount to nothing more than the usual crass bullying of another intellectual that has come to supplant better film and literature development in this country domineered instead by 'Animal House' and high school movies trying to reduce our establishment to zoos and mockeries in terms of international standards. Through this filter of film culture-study a picture of the Cold War victor begins to take on a caste of embedded contradictions&#133;not so much the friendly film skies and greatest country in history&#133;as it is in fact a continuation of the social war of the 1960s, a jingoistic sniping at the public from hidden bunkers and assassin boy scout camps of no account, now more contained in how the news media selectively manages the gathering dirty secrets as they pile up, cumulate in unexplained pandemic disease prevalence or just happen to come crashing down in tons of steel and debris for no official, discernible reason. If, upon weighing the available fare, interpreting and selecting from the alternatives this review stimulates a greater interest to seek out foreign film equivalents rather than continue to be bludgeoned by the bad parent of Hollywood imitations, hopefully the better informed consumer choice will result in a healthier film-going experience avoiding such obstacles to unhindered aspirations.

Antonia's line is the list of women and girls who live with her, principally her daughter, her daughter's daughter (born out of wedlock after an intentional sexual encounter with a chosen male), the granddaughter (an intellectual genius from her earliest years) and the granddaughter's daughter (conceived from a relationship with a childhood companion she seems to have married, though that isn't absolutely clear). But there are collateral descendants -- friends, a sexual partner with five sons as well as male and female strays that Antonia has taken in during the decades this film covers. Antonia (Willeke van Ammelroy) dominates the film, of course, but there are strong performances by Veirle van Overloop (as Therese, the adult granddaughter), Carolien Spoor (as Therese at age six), Mil Seghers as Crooked Finger (a nihilistic philosopher who teaches Therese much of what she knows as an adult) and Jan Decleir as the farmer with five sons whom Antonia takes as a lover. There is a great deal of explicit sex in this film engaged in by all members of Antonia's line (except her great grand daughter) plus other members of the company. It includes a lesbian coupling between Antonia's daughter and the granddaughter's public school teacher and an enthusiastic sexual relationship between the village priest who quits the church and the loves to be pregnant woman whose brother was the sperm donor for Antonia's granddaughter. For the most part, it's an exuberant film, encompassing a woman who bays at the full moon and her downstairs neighbor, the Protestant, a handsome farm boy who rapes his sister and many years later rapes Antonia's granddaughter. Antonia goes to the bar room where he hangs out, carrying a rifle, forcing him outside where she delivers a chilling curse before the five sons of her lover beat him to a pulp and he is then drowned by his brother to claim their farm as his inheritance. I got this film through Netflix and urge others to search it out. It's a wonderful movie. "},{"Title":"One of Gorris' best!","Date":"1 February 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" When Marleen Gorris debuted in 1982 with De Stilte Rond Christine M. (A Question of Silence), she quickly became one of the most prominent and controversial feminist artists of Europe, as the unapologetic (some would say extreme) feminism of the film was seen as a very angry reaction to the women's role in society. Her next two films followed this path, and soon she was known as an interesting director to be taken seriously; although the extremism of her work and the heavy handed way she handled her subjects often diminished the true potential of her movies. In her fourth movie, Antonia, Gorris seemed to make a big departure from her first movies, as the movie offered a more complete and humanist vision of life. It certainly was an enormous progression, not only in terms of her personal ideology, but also in terms of film-making, as in this movie she showcased her talents as storyteller like never before. The five years between The Last Island and Antonia really payed off, as this movie received the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 1996.Antonia is the story of well, Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy), a widow who returns to her home village after the World War II with her daughter Danielle (Els Dottermans), as she has received news that her mother is dying. After her mother's death, Antonia inherits the farm and along Danielle, she establishes there. And so Antonia and Danielle's new life begins at the village and, as time goes by, we witness Antonia's line to grow and develop, meeting old friends, finding new friends, and of course, gaining new enemies. The contrasting aspects of life and death, youth and decrepitude, and specially love and hate, become the key focus of the story of this community led by this strong (although often stubborn) woman. Antonia's story could easily be described as the story of the growth of a woman, and the growth of her odd family through more than three generations.Written by Marleen Gorris's herself, Antonia could be seen as the progression of Gorris' past works. While in the past she had portrayed the world almost as a constant struggle between males and females, Antonia showcases the quest for a balance between both. At its core, it is the story of Antonia, her family, and her village, growing and developing from the 50s through the 80s, and the important events in their lives; but it's also way more complex than that. It's about discovering what's important in life, and that what is important to some may not be important for others. Of course, being a Marleen Gorris' movie the relationships between male and female are of vital importance, but this time, extreme feminism is out and both genders are given a value (in an interesting change, Antonia herself must learn to love an accept a caring man). It's a clever character driven story filled with a good sense of humor, and an intelligent humanist theme.As written above, Antonia also marks Gorris' evolution to more ambitious and complex films, as while the movie is entirely character driven, the whole setting and overall composition of the movie is wonderful. Together with cinematographer Willy Stassen, Gorris makes a beautiful portrait of Europe's countryside, and accurately captures the slow but constant passing of time through the village. Jan Sewell's make-up is essential to this, as his work is of a frightening realism that one truly wonders if the cast suddenly became old for real. An interesting touch is how different the movie becomes according to the characters' points of view Antonia's scenes have a philosophical calm, while Danielle's world (as an artist) is quirky and suddenly surreal; contrasting sharply with her daughter Thérèse, who sees the world in a cold, distant and overtly scientific way.The many characters of the film are borough to life by an ensemble of both experienced and newcomer actors. Willeke van Ammelrooy is excellent in the main role as Antonia, a difficult one as her character is the one whose own personal growth becomes the basis of the rest of the film. Els Dottermans showcases her beauty and talent as Antonia's daughter, Danielle. While not the focus of the movie, her character plays a very important role in the story, and Dottermans plays the part in a very effective way. Overall the rest of the cast is remarkable (specially considering the lack of experience of some cast members), and really make the village a place so real and alive that one can't help but fall in love with the characters. While everyone makes a good job, Marina De Graaf as Deedee and the Carolien Spoor as the young Thérèse are really highlights of the film that deserve to be noticed.With its remarkably well developed screenplay and the warm touch of Gorris' direction, Antonia is truly a step forward in the director's career and an improvement over her previous work. While not a masterpiece, the movie is an upbeat movie that despite being at times emotionally manipulative, it's never annoying and really charming in its quirkiness. Critics have pointed out that Gorris' heavy handed extremism is still there, but personally I found a more mature piece of work, as if Gorris had finally exorcised her own demons and, like her Antonia, found a balance by discovering and accepting men instead of openly fighting them. Oddly, this new approach also brought criticism from Gorris' own followers, but it is in this balanced view where Antonia's main strength is, as more than being a feminism movie, it is a humanist one.Antonia is a joyful experience that, while not as deep as similar movies, it offers an interesting insight about human relationships; and despite not being exactly realist, raises interesting questions about love and unnecessary yet unavoidable battle of sexes. It seems that in 1996, the Academy got it right, Antonia is a great story. 8/10 "}{"Title":"Excellent Characterisation!","Date":"11 December 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Antonia's line is indeed a true celebration of life.

Antonia is at once an insider and an outsider in the village, which we explore through the two women's relationships with the villagers, each other, and the family that grows around Antonia throughout her life. Antonia and her daughter face joys, tragedies, and outrage while retaining an essential sense of self-regard and a core of strength.This movie is the antithesis of the Hollywood movie witness the sex scenes--one a pure definition of making _love_ as love is variously expressed, another depicting sex for convenience, another showing violence expressed as sex--none are lurid or extraneous to the story. A second example of the not-Hollywood nature of this film is the scene of Antonia with the gun and how the scene plays out.

It's about lore, life, love/lovelessness, and definitely not about logic.

It is laughable how so many read 'feminism' into the movie. There is none of it, unless you go about creating one on your own. Both male and female characters can be interpreted as strong or weak depending on how you choose to view them based on your own bias - the movie as it is, has no bias whatsoever. For example, is resisting marriage a 'strong' or 'weak' trait? Depends on your own experiences, opinions, and views, isn't it. Or, to bay at the full moon because you can't marry your Protestant lover - is that 'weakness', 'foolishness', 'madness' or 'strong love'? Or to drown your own kin (who has committed a heinous rape) when he is already beaten and weak by pushing his head into the water from the back without his ability to defend himself - is that 'righteous', 'weak', 'strong', 'anarchic', 'cowardly', brave' or what?The movie presents what it presents.

Antonia, called Antonia's Line in English, is a Dutch feminist film and has drawn criticism just for that. Sexists love to paint feminists with one brush based on a lunatic fringe, but as a male film watcher I can testify that there's nothing about the film that should be offensive to men. A villain rapist is a man, but rapists exist in life and there are plenty of men in the film who are decent. The women in the family never marry, but many of them still love men and keep them close in their lives. What really scares closet sexists is that the women in this movie are strong characters- even if it's in a positive way, that just won't sit will with those still wishing for a male-run society. The real objective of feminism is for men and women to share power, not make females the sole power.Antonia's Line (a title that makes more sense than the original title of Antonia, because it better captures the focus of the movie), is a fine film that includes colourful, interesting characters, some funny moments and some compelling drama. For example, Thérèse is an interesting character because of her abnormal intelligence, and when the narrator announces she's been raped it's a shocking, disheartening moment (even though we don't actually see that rape). There's also some humour in Danielle announcing she wants a baby but also having a lack of interest in a husband, and in how her own mother arranges for her to get laid. There are lots of characters for a fairly short film, but most of even the minor characters have some appeal. This movie deserved its Oscar and it deserves to be seen.

The main character impacts so many in this story that it seems implausable without seeing the film.

The central player, Antonia impacts the lives of many in her traditional male dominated community. She remains honest and dignified in rebuffing the sterotypical views for the male dominated community. What unfolds is a saga that deals with many issues and takes us on a journey with those characters through time. Antonia's Line is one of the most important films of recent memory.  It shows us that resolve and unwavering commitment can overcome any obstacles. Very Highly Recommended! 10 Rating!

This was just feminist trash, nothing 'real' about it, etc. I just re-read some of the reviews, were even worse than I remembered. The critics were amazed - to say the least - when Antonia went abroad and was highly praised - and won several prizes. In 1996 it was awarded an Oscar for best non-English language film. Today, as far as I am aware, it is shown in one cinema in The Netherlands - and only on one day a week, at a specific time. We were not even a dozen in this theater to watch the film.

We follow her through her collection of people which later (more-or-less) turns into a commune of sorts with Antonia as the head.  We discover that her daughter is a lesbian, and her grand-daughter is a child prodigy. And all the men in this film, with the sole exception of one, are either rapists, retarded, insane (although not criminally so), or otherwise not quite as advanced either mentally, spiritually, or otherwise to the women of this film.  It's obvious what point the author is trying to make with this film; yet this film does not actually stoop to male-bashing, which it easily could.  This alone is it's saving grace.  Had this movie turned into a stereotypical anti-male, lesbian, female-empowerment, film, it would have ruined the flavor of the overall tale.

Why in the hell is this Queen Antonia returning to this pig farm rather than taking a flight to LA to run a movie studio? And is the movie iconoclastic or religious? When the icons aren't moving, one can ponder this. Fun is poked at incense, out-of-wedlock kids are celebrated, the priest hates his job, yet they all attend mass every Sunday like good Catholics. Fits well with Twain and Hawthorne but not reality. And I'm not saying a film or story has to be real to be good. Of course there's an undercurrent of evil under much that is good. But we don't have to dwell on it. I didn't like The Scarlet Letter or Young Goodman Brown either. As for the feminist propaganda here, it's a joke. Antonia's in such control that she knows the exact date of her death. And she takes her time about it too. While being given the last rites, she berates someone for coming in late.

At least not as an Oscar worthy movie and everyone within the Netherlands at the time also was quite surprised it took home the Oscar.What I can say about this movie is that it feels like a waste opportunity. The movie feels like one with hugely potential and if it worked out better this could had really been an 'epic' strong feminist family drama but instead the movie jumps all over the place also with its different styles and it's mostly an ineffective one. There is not much interesting within the movie, although you certainly have the feeling that the story itself had plenty of interesting elements to offer but yet it somehow doesn't always translate well to the big screen. Perhaps if the movie would had been an hour longer it would had worked out better and also as a more effective one.The movie covers basically the entire lifespan of a strong-woman of the Dutch countryside and the future generations of women, her daughter her grand-daughter and right up till her great-grand daughter, while she herself is of course aging. This becomes an interesting aspect of the movie. It begins right after the end of WW II and it ends somewhere in the '90's or so I would guess. So the world around her is constantly changing but yet it also stays the same because she keeps all the people she care for close to her. This means that parts of the movie are set in different time-era's, which gives the movie something unique.It's obvious that this movie was intended as a strong feminist picture, with all strong female leads in it but with this I mostly feel that the movie isn't as effective as it should had been. It just doesn't feature enough strong or original moments within the movie.It's still a really well made and good looking movie though. It doesn't look at all like the movie got shot in the Netherlands, the countryside and all within this movie is far too beautiful looking for that. But I always have that with Dutch movies and I guess I just don't know how beautiful my country actually is. Perhaps I just need to stop watching so many movies and get out more...Female director Marleen Gorris is obviously capable of making a beautiful and professional looking movie. She actually now has a quite successful career in America as a movie director, which is quite an accomplishment not only because she is Dutch but also foremost because she is a female. She actually was the first woman to direct a movie that won an Oscar for best foreign film. Guess she is a strong woman just like Antonia in this movie and that's why she directed this movie with so much obvious passion and devotion. I wasn't too happy about the acting within this movie though. Willeke van Ammelrooy has always been praised for her role but in all honesty her performance is quite a mixed bag. As the younger Antonia she isn't always too great but as the older Antonia she's much better and more convincing. Can't say that the make-up always looks convincing though. Jan Decleir is normally always a real great actor but his role in this movie isn't anything too memorable but this is mostly due to the far too limited screen time he gets in this movie and he also has far too little lines to speak. He however still does a good job with his sequences and it's actually nice to notice that he took on a Dutch accent and for once dropped his native Belgian one. Still it's weird to hear many other actors within this movie still speak with a Belgian accent, while the movie is obviously set in the Netherlands but this of course has everything to do with the fact that this is a Belgium co-production and a certain part of the cast & crew just HAD to be Belgian.I wish I could say that it was a brilliant Dutch movie, worthy of its Oscar...6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Short, Sweet, and to the Point.","Date":"18 March 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" To talk about Antonia's Line, discussing plot, character, and mysticism, would mean to denounce the magic of this immaculate film.

Very immature, these filmmakers. Dutch actors have the tendency to turn their dialogue into a competition of who can speak the fastest.

At first, the movie seemed quirky and comical when one of the characters imagined seeing grandma getting up out of the coffin during her own funeral while the statue of Jesus comes to life. I was excited, because I like surreal movies like Happiness of Katakuris or Raising Arizona. BUT, just as quickly as these images came, the movie completely changed direction. This sort of thing happened again and again in the movie--as if the film had eight different writers who combined their stories without creating decent segues to join the stories. Comedy, philosophy (not the fun type--the life is futile and then you die type), sex, love, lesbianism, anti-church rhetoric, ultra-feminism, child prodigy stuff, sexual abuse, murder, etc., etc. all thrown together do not make ONE coherent film but either many separate movies or one big mess. How this film got the Oscar for Best Foreign Picture, I am uncertain, as it had too many holes and left me so unsatisfied. Perhaps it was a slow year. Or, perhaps AMPAS (the Oscar people) just have contempt for traditional morality and so they are rewarding this film for its stand against traditional values. A final note although these many story elements are perfectly acceptable for adult fair, this is NOT a film for kids as the subject matter is VERY mature. Also, I was deeply disturbed by the families portrayed in the film because apparently, NOTHING was private or adult in this extended home. Two examples come to mind the one scene where EVERYONE is making love like sex-crazed weasels so loudly that the little girl yelled at them to be quiet so she could get to sleep AND the scene where this same person (now an adult) is debating whether or not to have an abortion--while each child in the family tells her their opinion! This is sick and the family demonstrates a complete lack of reasonable boundaries. I'm not suggesting adults need to be prudes, but the idea of putting kids in these situations seems abusive and disturbing.
