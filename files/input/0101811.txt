It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that Enchanted April - an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone.Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, Enchanted April is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love.

Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye.

Rational and cool-headed English people always find the southern Mediterranean countries a place to channel their suppressed feeling and emotion, and Italy of course is one of the choices.At that conservative time, married housewives usually travelled overseas with their husbands.

And further afield in London, during the absence of their wives, the husbands also have revelation about their life goals and go to the island to join their life partners.  And happily, the cynical Caroline Dester found her love too.The cinematography was lyrical and comforting, a landmark of many European movies.

Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.

By the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation, peace, liberty or love. You get a sense throughout that Italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting. But in the heat of the spring in April, everyone's lives loosen and unravel (in line with the Victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. What a little gem of a film!

Even the act of watching it is soothing.  The four central characters are all women of means living in relative comfort but their lives lack passion and significance.  A holiday to Italy inspires them to relax and reassess their lives, something so many of us need and never do.   Lotty (Josie Lawrence) discovers an ad in the newspaper announcing an Italian castle available to let for the month of April.  She implores her neighbor, Rose (Miranda Richardson), to invest in the trip so that together they might find happiness.  Lawrence and Richardson beautifully portray compliant wives who are defined by their husbands, homes and obligations.  Their body language and speech are so repressed at the beginning of the film.  I found myself thinking that one or both of them will crack if they do not find peace.To defray the cost of the trip, Lotty and Rose invite two other women to share in the villa rental, an elderly matron (Joan Plowright) and a titled socialite (Polly Walker).  Interestingly, both Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline are very fragile, lonely women who have known great loss and mask their pain with cold exteriors.  One is trapped by her past while the other is trapped by her beauty.  Plowright shines as the brusque outer layers peel away and we discover her heart.While each actress portrays a traditional female stereotype (Lawrence the daft, eager to please wife, Richardson the puritan, Plowright the hardened dowager, Walker the used up party girl), it does not detract and in fact, includes the viewer as we see something of them in us and vice versa.For me, the essence of the film occurs when Lotty befriends Mrs. Fisher in a poignant scene.  It characterizes the hope that all the women had when they embarked on their journeys.  To love and be loved.  To be happy with self.  To be enchanted by life.

Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination. But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it. My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form. Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape. I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy. Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds. Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor. If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you. But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films.It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar. In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes. (Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV.) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies.

Being a male, I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own thing that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn't try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.

The movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as is Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying.The movie takes a couple of liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot/Briggs/Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this (it may be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like sentiment when it's well done).An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather.

Mrs. Lottie Wilkins (Lawrence) is the eager enabler, who relentlessly eggs on Mrs. Rose Arbuthnot (Richardson) to be her traveling companion and share the 60 pound rent from the proprietor George Briggs (Kitchen). Later, they are joined by another two guests the gorgeous socialite Caroline Dester (Walker) and the grumpy elderly widow Ms. Fisher (Plowright). This four women each has their very distinctive characteristics, Lottie is married to a steady but unimaginative lawyer Mellersh (Molina), whose business intuition and practicality always precede romantic consideration in their torpid marriage. But Lottie is an irrepressible happy-go-lucky, as she often states, she can see inside of a person, socially clumsy and frivolous, nevertheless, she never represses to be herself and is a perpetual transporter of mirth and cheerfulness no matter how inarticulate she is. Rose is a more levelheaded type, but also entrapped in a stagnant marriage with Frederick (Broadbent), a swinging novelist, as she laments, I bore him, and it is impossible to un-bore a person?, sexually- oppressed, her life needs to be reinvigorated. Caroline, is a young woman who owns everything, beauty, social status, wealth and countless suitors, yet, she is fundamentally disturbed by the emptiness of all of them, she needs time and space to think and un-think, a rich girl's blues. Finally Ms. Fisher, whose dame aura is a deterrent to cheap sympathy, piercingly ruminates her co-existence with solitude and battles the reliance on her walking stick. Directed by Newell before his career vertex FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (1994, 7/10), the film is comfortably confident with its ethereal location and simply storyline, most of the time nothing is happening, it is just 4 women enjoys their holiday with occasional and harmless bickering, cozily accompanied by some gleeful references of cultural discrepancy, embellishing with the straightforward Italian farce in the background. Then comes the high point when Mellersh, George and Frederick are all joined in the same room, a whiff of budding romance, awkward encounter and rekindled passion all materialise in the final act, but Newell maintains a firm hand not to let it slip into a chaotic fuss, instead, the vacation ends in a dignified fashion with which everyone seems to be content although as the ending implies, there is another story when they are back in London. A journey can rarely alter one's entire path-of-life, but it is a remedial getaway everyone needs (although a pretext is that you can afford it, with your nest egg sometimes), and it is a film in urgent demand of a BluRay upgrade, for all its stunning scenery and fine performances.Plowright won a Golden Globe and is Oscar-nominated for her mighty assurance and resounding thespian background, but can one buy her about-turn completely in the end? Not for me. The unheralded Polly Walker, is captivating to behold by her force of personality, evades any pretension one can reasonably expect judging by her character's background, and indeed she is the one generates more pathos among them all. Miranda Richardson, this versatile British actress, who is still under-appreciated although being twice Oscar-nominated, establishes adequate poignancy with subtlety while drawing a veil over her certain scene-stealing revelation, which syncs flawlessly with Josie Lawrence's adorable imprudence. In the gent department, as clearly in the supporting category, only Molina's expressive formality registers a strong impression. After all, ENCHANTED APRIL is not just a must-see for Anglophiles, it also has a unique weightless charm renders itself distinctive, you should give it a try, and hopefully, with a BluRay version in the near-future.

The last third of the movie seemed unbalanced with the coming of three additional characters making their development and the relational transformation rather sudden and inexplicable. However, the director and the novel's author were able to capture the first two thirds of the movie as a classic. The Italian setting was beautiful and gorgeous especially in contrast to the darkened-rain soaked Britain that began the movie. More amazing was the director and cinematographer absence of very much special camera tricks besides positioning and use of natural light to allow the setting to become part of the characters of the film. Sometimes in other movies, the background becomes the foreground so much as that it becomes a competition between live actors and the environment.The performances came off so witty and colorful in themselves which might be attributable to the intelligent script. This period movie seemed to exude a rich cultural breath of exotic air that in itself affected the audience. The audience is genuinely transported to another time and place. Enchanted April is the dramatic-version of contemporary Japanese culture of Lost in Translation (2003) and the fantasy setting version of contemporary Italian coming of age film Under The Tuscan Sun (2003) or the less surrealistic version of the haunting of the Australian period film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975).

It gets off to a slow start, but once the two women get off to their vacation, things pick up, and we get an engrossing story.The story was filmed as a mini-series for the BBC in 1992, and it was released theatrically in the US. The story takes place in England in the Twenties, and Lottie (played by Josie Lawrence) is sick of the weather - it's March - dreary, and rainy. Lottie and Rose (Miranda Richardson) become acquainted and are unhappy in their marriages, so they decide to rent a villa in Italy for the month of April. They can't quite afford it, though, so they advertise for another two ladies, and a more dissimilar quartet would be hard to imagine. Lottie's and Rose's husbands are played by Alfred Molino and Jim Broadbent, and all four are excellent. Joan Plowright and Polly Walker play the other two woman sharing the villa. Things get off to a rocky start and the ladies defend their turf and come to terms about who shall dominate whom. But the Italian April works its enchantment on them, and soon things go much better. Lottie decides to invite her husband to see if the magic can help them reconcile. Rose then writes to her husband to invite him. Then things get sticky. Jim Broadbent's character has been chasing Polly Walker's character unknown to Rose; Rose is being pursued by the owner of the villa.The resolution of the various threads is well done, and the ending is satisfying.

MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson, thinking she's a widow, but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone (he's nearsighted).Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby, ALFRED MOLINA, whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only explosive moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous.It's a simple tale, woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling, and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening. The pace is very slow, even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes, so it's not a tale for every taste. It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other.Nicely photographed in Italian locations, it's visually pleasing and easy to take, but really nothing special happens here.
