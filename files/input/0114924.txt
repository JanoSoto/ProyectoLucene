I love it when television networks play this film around wintertime because for some reason it doesn't suit any other time of year. In winter you like to have a comfort zone and this film is it! It tells the story of lonely singleton Lucy who daydreams of better things while working at a ticket booth and drooling over the secret crush of a local commuter (Peter Gallagher) One morning she saves him from a coming train and while he lies comatose she gets reluctantly cosy with his family. The deceit is understandable and by no means menacing, as it's Christmas the younger brother Jack (Bill Pullman) returns home and subsequently falls for Lucy. While you were sleeping is beautiful and sweet in so many ways You are reminded of the more old-fashioned romances of the 40's and 50's. There is not one hint of sexuality or lust in this as the love blossoms between Jack & Lucy is honest, pure and all together endearing. We all relate to Lucy on some level (a dream trip to Paris, Rome or in this case Florence) So it's hopeful to us all when she gets her happy ending. I absolutely loved it!

Then one day he is attacked by a couple of muggers and Bullock saves his life by getting him to the hospital. Naturally Gallagher is in a comatose state after the attack. A true misunderstanding makes it appear that Bullock is Gallagher's fiance and typical confusion ensues. Now Gallagher's family all believe that Bullock really is his woman. Gallagher's brother (Bill Pullman) is suspicious though, but slowly starts to believe Bullock as well. He then starts to fall in love with her and vice versa. A great romantic comedy that is so pure and well-made that it is near impossible to say anything negative about it. It is not a perfect film, but it is a very likeable movie that delivers what it promises. 4 stars out of 5.

And with good reason, because in `While You Were Sleeping,' directed by Jon Turteltaub, Bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day `girl next door,' in the best and most sincere sense.  This is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition, the need to love and be loved, and makes no bones about what it's trying to accomplish along the way.  Clearly, the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time.  And they succeed on both fronts.Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) lives alone in Chicago, where she has an apartment, a cat and a job with the CTA as a token taker for the train.  Her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful (read  Dull), and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth.  She's doesn't even know his name, and they've never exchanged so much as a `Good morning,' but in her mind he's become the Prince Charming she's always dreamed about.Then on Christmas morning he passes through, but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks, unconscious.  And a train is coming.  Lucy runs to his aid and saves his life, but the severe head trauma he's sustained has put him in a coma.  At the hospital, they refuse to let her in to see him, as that is a privilege reserved for family members only; so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee, which does the trick.  But when his family-- his rather `large' family-- shows up, her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket. Everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that Lucy simply can't get in a word of explanation.  The next thing she knows, to the family she is their beloved Peter's (Peter Gallagher) intended (even though he's never said a word to them about her), and because the situation is so frantic and there's such concern about Peter, besides which it's Christmas, Lucy can't bring herself to tell them the truth.  So in an instant, her life is suddenly changed; she's surrounded by `family,' and she's `engaged' to her Prince Charming.  Even if he is, well...in a coma.Turteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of Nora Ephron's `You've Got Mail' (the second best romantic comedy ever made) and `Sleepless In Seattle.'  He sets a perfect pace, and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way-- he makes you feel at home with them.  Most importantly, though, Turteltaub manages to make this a `sweet' film without being `saccharin' about it, which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow.  Instead, he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely Ephronesque and entertaining, and it works beautifully.  The humor is warm, and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of `need' that is universal, then triumphs by satisfying that need in the end.Sandra Bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here; there's a special quality about her Lucy that makes you want to reach out to her.  She is, without question, the most vulnerable character Bullock has ever played.  There is very little of Annie (`Speed') or Gracie (`Miss Congeniality'), for example, about her; the closest to Lucy of any of her characters, in fact, would be Birdee in `Hope Floats.'  That is not to say there is anything `weak' about Lucy at all-- quite the contrary, in fact. There is a decided strength in the very benevolence of Lucy's nature, even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs.  This is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life, but keeps an open mind and, above all, an open heart.  And that is what makes Lucy so endearing; she's the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her co-workers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better.  That's what Bullock brings to her performance here, and it's what makes Lucy one of her most enduring and memorable characters.As for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door, that's exactly what Bill Pullman does with his portrayal of Peter's brother, Jack Callaghan.  He's the one who shows up after the fact, as it were, but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience.  Initially, Jack seems to be playing the role of devil's advocate, his suspicions aroused by the fact that Peter has never mentioned Lucy to him; but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective.  And Pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time, which makes Jack convincing, and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly.  A `character actor' type leading man, Pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters, but Jack is his most engaging role ever, and he succeeds entirely with it.The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.  Warm and poignant, `While You Were Sleeping' is one to savor; this one's a keeper.  (BTW, the #1 romantic comedy?  Bonnie Hunt's `Return To Me').  10/10.

Speed - one year earlier - showed this. This picture proved it. A lot of people nowadays make fun of a typical Bullock picture and speak of her as negligible in this day and age. They probably forget or were never aware that she was hailed as America's new sweetheart back in '95 and it was no idle chatter. There are very few actresses who can carry a picture on their own slight shoulders - I mean, really make it a success. Sure, Bill Pullman helped, but this really was Sandra all the way, in a sappy, soapy, clich√©-ridden slight story of sudden romance usually very hard to buy into. But because Sandra is there on the screen throughout nearly every frame, it all works out, and you're rooting for her happiness in the final few minutes even knowing very well what is about to happen. It's like you've seen it all before, but Sandra makes you want to see it again. We are all very fortunate, those of us who have seen this story, that it was Sandra in the central role and not someone like (shudder) Demi Moore. And if a guy is really fortunate, he may meet someone like Sandra in real life.

She has no family, and is usually stuck doing holiday shifts in the Chicago transit system (as a toll booth clerk on the elevated railway). She has noted one man who uses the station all the time (Peter Gallagher), and rescues him when he is thrown onto the train tracks just before a train comes into the station. Gallagher is in a coma and (due to a well-intentioned nurse) Bullock is introduced to the family of Gallagher as his fianc√©. She tries to tell them the truth, but when she learns his grandmother (Glynis Johns) has a heart problem she hesitates. Soon she is treated as a member of this nice family as a member (well, she did save Gallagher, and she is thought to be his fianc√©). Only his brother (Bill Pullman) has real doubts, and keeps mentioning them (and keeps apologizing for them. Bullock and Pullman find that they are also growing more attracted to each other. The film shows how these problems are resolved. And it is all done in a most charming manner.This is one of those films that would take only a few minutes to quickly resolve in the real world, where Bullock would have told the truth early on. But the audience is allowed to suspend it's disbelief because the characters are uniformly likable. Although Jack (Pullman) is constantly questioning Bullock's story, each time she gives a plausible explanation of what is going on, and Pullman likes her enough to accept these explanations. The only one who knows the truth is the family friend Sam (Jack Warden) and he too feels that the news has to be broken carefully (he loves the family and doesn't want them hurt). Oddly enough his one effort at meddling almost screws up the situation in the film for Bullock, Pullman, and Gallagher. Pullman also faces the truth and explains to his father (Peter Boyle) that he doesn't want to continue in the family business. Boyle's reaction becomes important too.The performances are flawless, and one finds oneself rooting for most of the cast (the sole exception is the actress playing Ashley, Peter Galagher's actual girl friend). Her opposite number, Joe Jr. is too comic a figure to dislike (in fact, at one point he thinks Pullman is annoying Bullock and offers to take care of him - not the act of a rat at all). For a sweet, lovable love tale WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is hard to top. In the last decade only WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, WORKING GIRL, PRETTY WOMAN, NOTTING HILL, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, and YOU'VE GOT MAIL are on par with it, but the family becomes so important to Bullock in the plot this has a special warmth in it that is quite is different from most of the others.

Bullock obsesses about a man she sees briefly every day; when he is knocked unconscious she claims to be his fianc√©e. Then sparks begin to fly with the brother. Wonderful turns by Boyle and Warden as older family members. There's a great line by Boyle in this movie, something like you always imagine you'll have these long golden moments in life and then when you get there it lasts about a minute. I think Bullock was never better than in this movie, in later productions her shy modesty seems a little artificial. She and Pullman have just enough chemistry together to pull this through.

I watched part of 'The Net' in a theater, but walked out in disgust. She is much more appealing in this film, which I have watched repeatedly.The plot is somewhat thin underfoot, but the cast overcomes this with some of the greatest efforts I have ever seen. Sandra is luminous as Lucy Moderatz, a woman who has suffered a great deal of loss in her life and seems doomed to a lonely life alone. Lucy eases her heartache by dreaming about wedding the handsome man who buys a token at her booth every weekday morning.When an improbable collection of circumstances result in Lucy being accepted as the fianc√©e of her dream man who is in a coma and in no condition to refute her claim; she gains the warm, loving family she has so long desired. Lucy makes such an instantly positive impression on the family of her supposed fianc√©e, they are delighted to make her part of the family. When her 'fiancee' wakes from his coma and fails to recognize Lucy, the family covers the gap by presuming amnesia rather than suspecting some subterfuge on the part of Lucy.I enjoyed many parts of this film. The best part was where the family gathered to exchange Christmas presents. Lucy had her name on a stocking and a present from Santa. The look on Lucy's face as she savored these moments was priceless. The next morning, Lucy meets Jack her 'fiancee's' brother and sparks immediately fly.This film really illustrated how deprived Lucy has been. When she needs personal advice, she has to rely on her boss at work. Basically, her fellow workers and her would-be boyfriend at her apartment complex are her only human contact. It would seem logical that Lucy would join a church or find some other social outlet.All the supporting cast is great here. The performers fit into their roles perfectly. Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock really bring their characters to life. You find yourself rooting for the inevitable victory of true love over circumstances.This is movie entertains without the need to appeal to the baser instincts. It was grand to see an intact, functional family for once. We need more efforts like this to show that a great movie can be made using wholesome themes.

It's very rare to fall in love with a movie, and 'while you were sleeping' has that effect on me. The key to the Lucy and Jack's romance is chemistry, and boy did they have chemistry. The element to a great story, whether it is reading or watching is to show not tell. And that's what exactly what it was. The looks that you see Jack and Lucy give each other, their body language, the deep conversations they have, the way he describes her, and how she's head over heels for him. The tension they create when put together wasn't anything sexual; it was something much, much deeper. Something that will last a lifetime. The other key factors to this movie are the Callaghans and Saul, and everyone else. They bring out the comedy side to the movie. They are a hilarious bunch, and are not a tad annoying, not even the real fianc√©e or Peter; just really, really funny and fun to be with.Put two and two together, and they have formulated an almost perfect Romantic Comedy.

But instead of explaining things to Peter's family, she begins to enjoy having a family. But things only get more complex as time passes.While You Were Sleeping is incredibly cheesy, that much is undeniable. But under the hammy premise (that only gets worse as the film goes on), While You Were Sleeping is lots of fun.While You Were Sleeping plays out like a long I Love Lucy episode. The filmmakers must have realized this too, as the main character is named Lucy, and there's a brief reference to Ricky Ricardo. Amusing twists (some more predictable than others) are inserted to keep filmgoers on their toes. The result is often hilarious.The best bits of the film are when the whole family is together talking. They're often rambling about random topics until the end of the conversation that may leave you thinking, What brought that up? To make it more amusing, each family member is having a completely different conversation with another. I have trouble describing these parts, it's something you'd have to see for yourself.While You Were Sleeping is very well acted. While there's nothing award-deserving here, the acting feels natural. The characters are memorable, and often funny. Sandra Bullock plays perfectly as a desperate young girl, and Bill Pullman is convincing as a secondary love interest.The score (composed by Randy Edelman), while sometimes fun (especially during moments of chaos), the score sounds incredibly dated. The music isn't bad, but the dated themes are a little less pleasant than the rest of the score.While You Were Sleeping manages to overcome it's cheesy premise and clich√©s.

How this resolves itself I'd better not say.I felt the script was rather weak at times - the fencing between Bullock and the confused, attracted brother convinced this girl is a sponger could have been better and the actor is not I'd say entirely right for the part. However, it's still a delightful movie and I can't see anyone not enjoying it.

She ably carries the movie, even when surrounded by veterans like Jack Warden, Peter Boyle and Glynis Johns.Those who are familiar with Chicago will have fun with this film, as that's where it was filmed, and you could make a game out of spotting the inconsistencies in the movie if you actually know the city it's set in.A fun movie to pop in here and there during the holiday season.Grade A "},{"Title":"My favourite romantic comedy!","Date":"30 August 2007","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I love this movie and can watch it over and over again.

Bill Pullman is gorgeous (I cant understand why he has not done more leading man roles). He has the sexiest voice. I much prefer this film to Sleepless in Seattle, whilst it is not laugh out loud funny, it does have some very good comedic moments and has an excellent feel-good factor. It does not seem to have received the accolades of other romantic comedies such as Pretty Women and Sleepless in Seattle but I think it is a little gem which is worthy of viewing.

She lives alone and has no family in the area so is always the one to get dumped with the holiday shifts. Lonely, she has fashioned a fantasy around a man who gets the train at around 0800 each day. On Christmas Day she sees this man being mugged and falling onto the tracks. She manages to save him from an oncoming train even though he falls into a coma. A mistake at the hospital sees a nurse telling the man's family that Lucy is Peter's fianc√© and, before she can deny it, she is taken to the bosom of his rather tumultuous family. Unable to tell them the truth and rather taken by this sudden sense of belonging to a group, Lucy plays along but the arrival of Peter's brother Jack sees her story being doubted.When aliens come to earth and demand to know what Sandra Bullock is for, this should be one of the films that you sit them down in front of because she pretty much makes it. This is not as easy as it sounds because on paper this is a ludicrously silly set-up that could have been as cloying and sentimental as one fears these things can be. However the film somehow manages to deliver it with a blue-collar, homely, charm. The light comic air helps because it gets under your skin by not appearing to take itself too seriously but then managing to weasel a story in there amongst the sweetness. This is not to say that it is a brilliant film of course but by general standards it most certainly is not. It is though, a good genre film that will please those that go in for rather sweet rom-coms. Those that don't should avoid but those in-between may find they that it amuses them.Turteltaub's direction of his actors is good and visually everything feels rather warm and safe (even the mugging is rather suburban and sanitised) which does suit the material. I didn't like the overuse of the kooky incidental music which seemed at times to be everywhere; I knew what I was watching I didn't need it musically rammed down my throat! I'm not sure how she will be remembered but on her day few can do romantic comedy like Sandra Bullock. If you don't like her you don't like her I guess but she does have good looks wrapped up in a sort of sweet, girl-next-door sort of thing and it is this that carries her in this film. She is vulnerable when she needs to be and mostly she is bang on with her performance. She works well with the rest of the cast and even manages to make the absurd relationship with Pullman work. He is not quite at her level but they have a good chemistry together that he works well. The support cast help create this rather comic world that makes the plot float better and features unspectacular if entertaining turns from Boyle, Warden, Johns and others. Gallagher is the focus and does his job well even if he has the thankless task of lying around for most of it.Overall then an enjoyable if silly romantic comedy. It works because it mostly avoids laying on the sentiment in a syrupy way, it has a consistently comic air and it features mostly charming performances led by the very down-to-earth and charming Bullock.

I tend to find them lame most of the time. However, this one is not bad. There's something about this one that sets it apart from others of its genre. It isn't boring, lame or mushy stuff. This one is original, fresh, funny and romantic. Plus, it takes place at Christmas time. Actually, it captures the Christmas spirit and it shows us houses full of lovely Christmas decorations and lights.This movie is naturally more recommendable for those who like sugary stories or romantic stories and even for those who still believe in love. Yet, it is a reasonable choice for those who are unhappy in love or bitter about it.The soundtrack is quite good. One of the movie's best songs is Natalie Cole's oldie This Will Be (An Everlasting Love). The opening credits combine expressive and beautiful sights of Chicago with Natalie Cole's old classic.The actors are generally good and portray generally likable characters. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman form a perfect couple and their chemistry is faultless. The rest of the cast is not bad too Jack Warden, Peter Boyle, Jason Bernard (he's hilarious in this movie) and Glynis Johns (best known as Mrs. Banks from Mary Poppins). The role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz was originally for Demi Moore, but I'm glad that it went for the beautiful Sandra Bullock instead. Sandy is perfect for this role. I don't see Demi in this role.There are many funny moments during the movie, including a hilarious one with a newspaper's boy falling off his bike. Then again, the movie is, in general, fun and amusing, aside some humor of discussable taste.

But it isn't until Sandra meets Bill Pullman that the film really begins to click. The chemistry between them is undeniable and gives the film the lift it really needs to soar. A charming, harmless piece of fluff that almost seems out of place amid the harsh realities of the '90s--it's more like a throwback to the kind of comedies Carole Lombard did so well. The wintry landscapes of Chicago provide a perfect background for the story of a token booth clerk who falls for a handsome rich guy.

Some of the striking things how well the plot continues to work after Peter Gallagher's character goes through a change; the real chemistry between Bill Pullman and the delightful Sandra Bullock; the wonderful acting by Peter Gallagher as someone who comes to realize he's really NOT had a good character in his life so far (he's charming while also discovering this dismaying truth).Most of all it's the modesty and naturalness of Sandra Bullock - as a poor, lonely, still missing her late father, terribly sweet yet never coy, completely lovable, utterly sympathetic. We are WITH her in every frame. We want her to gain everything her heart desires - and we really LIKE Bill Pullman too.It seems to me that any romantic comedy rests largely on how likable the characters are - we must completely sympathize with them, feel with them - they can have difficulty deciding between love/career or love/location or between two people -- but we can't have difficulty deciding whether we yearn for them to be happy.In some respects, Sandra Bullock does seem a throwback - I could easily imagine this movie taking place during the Depression - though it would be a role reversal (in screwball comedies - which this really isn't - the woman are wealthy and the men are poor).There's an innate decency in the character played by Sandra Bullock - in that respect, it reminds me of the somewhat more genteel characters played by Irene Dunne in comedies like The Awful Truth or My Favorite Wife or Penny Serenade - you are watching a genuinely kind and thoughtful person when you see the characters - and it draws you in. (It's why I find it hard to imagine that Demi Moore was originally slotted to play this character - she has a toughness of heart that I cannot imagine for this character).This movie was written so well that I looked to see what else the screenwriters had done - nothing is listed! You can't go wrong with this movie - one of the top several movie comedies in the last half century.

As she is working in a booth at a train station in Chicago she meets a handsome man called Peter(Peter Gallagher) who is taking a train journey and she develops feelings for him as he comes by everyday to get a ticket from her booth.But when two teenagers thrown him off the train station,Lucy saves him from a train coming on the train tracks by jumping into the tracks to get him out and he goes to hospital.

As Peter is in hospital Lucy spends some time with his family and later meets Peter's brother Jack(played by Casper star Bill Pullman). But then she starts to fall in love with him and must decide how long will her facade with Peter end and which man does she love more Jack or Peter?Bottom line I loved While You Were Sleeping,similar to the 2009 film The Proposal where Bullocks' Margaret made out she was engaged to Andrew but later falls in love with him for real, I really enjoyed this film.Sandra Bullock was really good in this movie and her chemistry with Bill Pullman as Jack was so cute.I wish I could buy this on DVD but its impossible to get it only online but the next time its on TV I will definitely be recording it on VHS.Overall While You Were Sleeping is a thumbs up and a great film to watch at Xmas time as its always on TV at Xmas.Also without giving too much away the ending was so adorable but my only concern is the movie poster,its kinda making the film predictable as you know what man she chose in the end judging by the picture but still I loved this movie.They just don't make movies like that anymore only know and again.7/10Ps I finally got it on DVD and I really loved this movie.

Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses.This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her.

It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd.Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well.If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film.

Particularly suspicious was Peter's brother, Bill Pullman as Jack.Being the meek type Lucy doesn't reveal the truth and actually goes along with the ruse, which works because Peter has amnesia from his fall, and becomes adjusted to the fact that he is to marry her. But Jack remains skeptical.Gallagher and Pullman are excellent in their roles, but this is mainly a vehicle for Bullock. A good role and an entertaining movie.SPOILERS Peter and Lucy get all the way to the altar, friends and family in attendance, and Jack as Best Man. But LUcy can't go through with it, as she got to know him Peter was not someone she could fall in love with. However, she had in the process fallen in love with Jack instead, and the feeling was mutual.

Sandra Bullock is a really beautiful and talented actress, her confession in front of the whole family saying that she loves Jack(Bill P.) and not Peter(Peter G.) is really well rendered. And Bill Pullman, well the man really doesn't have to do that much, he's  just simply mind blowing! But as usual he does a great job as Jack.

Jon Turtletaub's film is far better than Nora Ephron's recent hit Sleepless in Seattle. There is no blatant predictability nor obvious contrivances, and this picture has considerable wit, being oft times hilarious.Turtletaub has turned the everyday, and the not so everyday, into a collection of very funny situations with apparent ease. While keeping the whole story very close to home, he has graced the movie with enough off beat moments and quirky characters to really guarantee the audience much enjoyment.Essentially though, this is romantic-comedy at its very best. While You Were Sleeping is most definitely romantic, and successfully deals with personal ideals and the awkward reality of love, and of course it's heartwarming in its humour. But what really makes the whole film work so successfully are the endlessly likable lead players.Sandra Bullock is totally charming and adorably lovable, and is just beginning to show some real versatility following her role in the action blockbuster Speed. The homely good looks she possesses mean that Miss Bullock has no trouble winning hearts with a mere smile. Equally agreeable is Bill Pullman, who plays second fiddle to the lovely Miss Bullock, an unsung actor who was well overdue a chance to play a lead role, after a string of impressive support roles including Ruthless People, The Accidental Tourist and Sommersby.Perhaps this picture does become a fraction contrived in the last ten minutes, though it still remains an absolute joy over all.Friday, June 23, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaAgain one of the most likable films of the year from director Jon Turtletaub. The film's simplicity is a big help, with an amiable script telling an easy tale of love at second sight.The movie's best asset is the very enjoyable cast lead by every girl Sandra Bullock, whose 'girl next door' charms will win your heart with ease. With no outstanding performances, support cast back up Miss Bullock most admirably, with Bill Pullman especially enjoyable as the love lorn Jack, who has fallen head over heels for the slightly nutty Lucy.The comedy is marvellously handled by all concerned, making the very most of this humorous pic, peopled with eccentric characters as it is.

It is quite simply charming.  Before I saw it, I admit I was not the greatest Sandra Bullock fan; ten minutes into the film, I had more than changed my mind and made a complete 180 degree turn in my opinion of her.  Sandra Bullock is truly endearing in this hilarious case of mistaken identity romantic-comedy; it's easy to see how she has become a household name after it--there is really something fresh, sincere, and approachable but also compellingly vulnerable about her character Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.  Yet we cannot help but admire her integrity, her battle of conscience against continuing to deceive Peter's family, and wonder--Why *should* she be lonely?  Why is it so wrong what she's doing, since she's clearly come to love this family?  The interesting, unusual view of a typical Chicago winter and delightfully quirky writing in While You were Sleeping as well as the fine performances of the supporting cast, are also an integral part of the overall success of this film.  Bill Pullman's character Jack, the hard-working Everyman, is not presented in a patronising light, and I found this ordinary hero refreshing.  So many more patrician films tend to praise the likes of his elder brother, the highly successful, power/wealth-driven businessman Peter, and portray the hard-working everyman as nothing more than a crass boor with few, or with obscure ambitions.  Moreover, Sandra's portrayal of the sweet but unglamorous, next-door girl turned heroine Lucy, shines among a plethora of more common female performances in films (such as Pretty Woman) which more directly resort to an overt Cinderella storyline.  While You Were Sleeping is among the best romantic-comedies of all time.  Anyone with a sense of humor could not be disappointed by it.

But, to buy into the situation as is means to be carried away by Bullock's performance--and that's an easy task. She lights up the screen, but in a quiet, easy way. There were few chances for her to really be easy and natural in Speed (although I liked her worried line to the passengers, Are we dragging him? when Keanu Reeves was under the bus) and her brief appearance in The Vanishing was just what that doom-laden movie needed. This picture seems to be tailored to her low-keyed effervescence, and Sandra's chemistry with Bill Pullman is exactly right. She becomes friends with a loud, jubilant family here, her face lighting up in surprise at her own enjoyment, and in these moments I couldn't have cared less about the trite set-up of the plot, the hectic finale or some of the wobbly writing (as with a bad caveat about a character having one testicle--not good material for a comedy).

It is an exhilarating and essentially perfect romantic comedy. It comes off so wonderfully because of the central casting of the irresistibly charming Sandra Bullock. Whatever she lacks in Vogue cover beauty, she makes up for in tsunamis of personality. Who could say no to her? All she has to do is just smile or just look at you. Well, Bill Pullman certainly can't resist her in this film. And neither could his family. This film is so famous that most people know the story, which is the ingenious notion that Bullock saves the life of a handsome young man, played by Peter Gallagher, who is mugged and falls unconscious onto an overground subway track in front of an oncoming express train in Chicago. Bullocks leaps down, rolls over with him, and they just make it. She goes with him to the hospital but they won't let her follow him in because she is not a family member, so she pretends to be his fianc√©e. Then the story takes place while he is sleeping. i.e. in a deep coma, where Gallagher's family accept him as his fianc√©e and she is in countless comedic situations of having to pretend to know all sorts of things about him. In fact she had been in love with him for a long time, but they had never really met. It is a great idea, and it works to absolute perfection. There are many, many laughs. The film was magnificently directed by Jon Turteltaub (which means 'turtle dove' in German, just in case you wondered), who came from the unlikely background of having previously directed (gasp, gulp) 3 NINJAS (1992). Believe that if you can. This film is the only listed writing credit for Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric LeBow. What happened to them? Surely they should have gone on writing stuff of this calibre. Did a hole in the earth open up and swallow them? The story and script are absolutely brilliant. Bill Pullman is also perfectly cast as the brother of Gallagher who falls in love with Bullock but nobly refrains from doing anything about it. Jack Warden provides heavyweight backup as family friend 'Uncle' Saul. The dotty family are all marvellous. Everybody is marvellous, everything is marvellous, the film is marvellous. Get the picture?

"}{"Title":"A great romantic comedy which is underrated","Date":"2 June 2008","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The genre of romantic comedies may not be a genre producing depthful insights, dramatic acting or meaningful morals....but it centers about the two most warm and nice emotions, humour and love. There can't be nothing wrong with this. Now many movies of this genre are just what you expect, they are cheesy, diabetes-inducing sweet, shallow movies. Sometimes the Humour outweighs the love so much it becomes intolerable, sometimes the love aspect is so heavy you are forced to vomit. Then many movies make the mistake of mixing love with lust or even replacing them. That does not go for romantic in my opinion. So the moviegoer is left with only a few notable movies, which make your heart glow There are PRETTY WOMAN, NOTTING HILL, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, YOU GOT MAIL, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and of course WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.Unlike some others in my listing, this movie sets his characters in a real normal life. They are all average people, who could live next your door. That's one point in making this movie memorable. Because if such a sweet love can happen to those guys, it can happen to you as well.The story may seem to be a bit far fetched (girl saves guy, gets mistaken for his fianc√©, family invites her over for Christmas, she falls in love with the brother and so on) but it is not as far fetched as a millionaire falling for a prostitute, a journalist falling for just a boys story and drives through the US to Seattle or a movie star just walking in a normal bookstore...The humour is great, soft and loving instead of cynical. The only cynical remark (if you fit in my pants, I'll kill myself) is like you are kidding around with your friends. The love is also sweet. It never becomes sexual or lust-laden. Just pure love. Unlike all the aforementioned movies, here another love is playing a role, the love for and of a family. Anyone who, like Bullock's character, has lived without any family for some time knows what I speak of.The acting is good. Not great, as I said i don't expect that in a romantic comedy, but better than in most other movies of that genre (and many other genres as well).The last great point for this movie are the characters. The movie makes no point in creating a despicable, mean character. The family Callaghan are so nice and warm, even Peter (who the viewer gets to know only a lot later in the movie) seems to be able to leave his playboy life and settle with Sandra Bullock. Also heartwarming is the role of Joey Fusco. He seems to really love Sandra Bullock in his own way. He tries to protect her and be a real friend, though he is obviously not her type. Even the real fianc√© of Peter Callaghan, Ashley, does not come evil just shallow and possessive. Her appearance lasts only a few minutes, too.All in all, if you're looking for a great movie to make you feel good, get this one.

As long as they are at least somewhat original - which sometimes seems harder to find than you would like to believe - I really can have a good time with them. But for some reason I feared that this movie wouldn't belong to that category and that's why it took me almost ten years to finally watch it. Now that I did, I know that I shouldn't have waited that long.Lucy is already in love with Peter for a very long time. The only problem is that she has never really spoken to him and that he probably doesn't even know of her existence. He's a commuter to who she sells a ticket for the metro every day. When on Christmas Day he's attacked by some muggers, he falls on the rails and lies there unconscious. Lucy doesn't hesitate, but immediately goes after him and saves him from the oncoming train. Then he goes into a coma and is transported to hospital. And that's where all the problems start. The hospital staff confuses her for his fianc√©e, which they also tell to his family. They immediately welcome her into the family and Lucy, who isn't used to so much family happiness and warmth, isn't able to tell them that she and Peter haven't got a relationship. To make things even more complicated for her, Peter's brother falls in love with her and when Peter himself wakes up, he too believes that she is his fianc√©e...Even though the story feels a bit like all other romantic comedies, I must say that I like the new approach of a man in coma as the subject of affection. Even though he plays a very important role in this movie, his performance only consists of lying there with his eyes closed. And somehow that feels more OK than seeing yet another clumsy guy who is able to win the heart of the woman of his dreams. But not only the story is OK, so is the acting. Sandra Bullock, Jack Warden, Bill Pullman,... were nice to watch and even though Peter Gallagher didn't really have a difficult part, he too did a good job.I guess the only 'problem' that I had with this movie was that it was situated during Christmas time, while I saw it in the beginning of September. I'm not saying that I wasn't able to get completely involved in it, but somehow it felt a bit weird to see snow and to see them decorate the Christmas tree. That's also the reason why I believe that this is a perfect movie to play in that time period instead of THE Christmas classic The Sound of Music. You're already completely in the right mood then and I'm sure that such a movie would only add to that perfect feeling of family happiness. But than again, it's not that you can't watch this movie on another day either.All in all this is one of the better romantic comedies that I've seen lately. I had some good laughs with it, the romance was a bit weird but believable, the acting was good and the story original. What more can you expect from such a movie. Not much if you ask me and that's why I give it a well-deserved 7/10.

Instead of focusing on who will win in the love triangle for the entire film, the viewer gets to enjoy the give and take between the other family members and the chemistry that attracts Lucy to them even though she knows she is living a lie. Even the smaller supporting characters are pillars in the plot development and take you on twists and turns as to who ends up with who in the end.

I believe Speed came out just before and it got her noticed, but this was the movie that really made her career. It is too bad she has had nothing quite as good as this since.The dialog in this film is extremely clever. The humor and the musical soundtrack are perfectly orchestrated with each other. It is true that the family that Sandra's character meets is rather silly -- but they are SO endearing, it is impossible not to appreciate them. Glynis Johns and Peter Boyle -- what great character actors they have been over the years. They were delightful.Sandra's character sneaking to the back entrance of her Chicago apartment to avoid her scrungy, icky neighbor; her accidentally letting the Christmas tree fall out of the window; the music at the party stopping at a VERY inopportune moment for Bill Pullman; Sandra's character saying hello to her boyfriend's cat for the first time; there are several comic moments in this movie too numerous to mention.What ties the whole movie together is, however, the thoughtful parts of the script. Sandra's character is lonely and for some reason, it comes across as being very human; many of us can relate to her, and that is why I suspect that this film was held over in theatres for as long as it was. I saw it 5 times in the actual theatre and enjoyed it all 5 times. She wanted a family for Christmas and not to be alone. I know this sounds so cheesy, but it is portrayed brilliantly. Hats off to the marvelous people who wrote this screenplay. They know their craft well.It is EXTREMELY sad that Richard Roeper has bad-mouthed this movie as an obnoxious Chicago movie. Nothing could be further than the truth. There are MANY obnoxious movies set in Chicago, but this is definitely NOT one of them.GREAT SCRIPT, GREAT SOUNDTRACK, GREAT MOVIE.

In a vehicle that was written originally for Demi Moore by Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow, Bullock shines as Lucy Moderatz, a lonely token collector at a Chicago L-train station. The plot focuses almost completely on Lucy and how she becomes involved with not only Peter Callaghan, the object of her romantic fantasies, but his loving family as well. It all turns on a train platform incident where muggers have pushed Peter onto the tracks at which point Lucy saves him from an oncoming train.The seemingly innocent deception begins when a hospital nurse assumes that Lucy is Peter's fianc√©e. Since he is comatose and she is smitten with the man she thinks he is, the charade gets bigger as the Callaghans welcome her with open arms. However, the inevitable complications ensue when Peter's brother Jack enters the picture at first suspicious but then...well, you can figure out the rest. There are definitely some narrative lapses that make this film less than logical, for example, the Callaghan's somewhat blas√© attitude toward Peter's comatose state once they meet Lucy. Regardless, Turteltaub manages to make the lightweight film feel like a throwback to an earlier era of romantic comedies.Bill Pullman makes a nice, casual leading man as Jack, and there is genuine chemistry between the two stars. The rest of the cast is sharp and funny, in particular, Peter Boyle as the Callaghan paterfamilias, a far warmer variation than his Everybody Loves Raymond curmudgeon; Glynis Johns as the dotty grandmother, not that far removed from her maternal suffragette in Mary Poppins; Michael Rispoli as Lucy's persistent suitor and wannabe cross-dresser, Joe Jr.; Jack Warden as understanding Uncle Saul; and Peter Gallagher nicely underplaying the less-than-ideal Peter. But it's Bullock's show, and no matter how many times she has recycled her persona on lesser comedies since then, it's her sincerity, self-deprecating manner and plain-faced beauty that makes this movie one of the better studio confections of the 1990's. The 1998 DVD has no extras.

It was funny and entertaining as well as, well casted. There are not too many movies that I want to watch again but I have seen this over 100 times and will watch it many more. It seems to be so well written and directed that even when you know the ending, you still get caught up in the emotions of the characters throughout the movie. The late jack Warden was fantastic but Sandra Bullock showed us how wonderful of actress she is and convinced the audience how she could fall in love with a family. I think it is that it is more than just the average romance film where a man or a woman falls in love and has to overcome some obstacles to fulfill that love but how a woman can fall in love with a guy as well as his family.

He was just terrific as well as Sandra Bullock. The movie is a lovely comedy in which Lucy (Sandra Bullock) falls in love with Jack's (Bill Pullman) brother (Peter), a successful businessman. Every day her love grows as she always sees him on the subway while she works in a toll booth. After an incident with Peter, Lucy dives into his family as if she were his fianc√©. Confusion begins until Jack (Peter's brother) notices Lucy and falls in love with her as well. It is a wonderful film, full of surprises. And Bill Pullman is simply great!

Sandra Bullock does this kind of movie as well as anyone, and she has Bill Pullman, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden and others along for the silliness.The plot has a wild premise, but this great cast makes it work. The story navigates through constant misunderstandings between characters, driving the plot forward with more and more chaos ensuing as the movie progresses. Bullock and Pullman, as the lead characters Lucy and Jack, have both comedic and romantic chemistry. Everybody in the supporting cast is delightful in their roles, as well. Two of the most hilarious characters are Lucy's neighbor and Jack's great-aunt.Like any romantic comedy, sentimental moments are interspersed with the craziness. My personal favorite is when Lucy joins the Callaghan family for Christmas. The close-ups of her while Christmas music plays in the background, along with the family's banter, is endearing.It's a great popcorn movie, and a great date movie. Highly recommended for those who like romantic comedy and for Sandra Bullock fans.

The Callaghan family may be funny but did not necessarily have to be stupid. However, if this initial weak point can be ignored, the rest of the movie is a simple fairy tale told in a charming and lovely way. The activities of the Callaghan family is hilarious. Although it seems to be a problem to understand Sandra Bullock's babbling (she mumbles most of the time), she is cute in her over-sized outfits carrying a lonely, bored, puzzled, craving-for-love type of a disposition. It is totally impossible to imagine Demi Moore in Lucy's role, which was originally written for Ms Moore. Bill Pullman is irresistibly attractive in the role of Jack Callaghan. Bullock and Pullman make a real romantic couple. (Pullman has lovely hair and a great smile). The ending, however, has lost its intensity and was not so thoughtfully projected.

But as far as the plot develops itself we become conquered by the girls simple and naive behaviour and her display of nice sentiments. We become also conquered by the wonderful family of the man in the coma who are such nice people that make us also wish to have had a family like that. Well after little time the story changes direction and takes a somewhat predictable one which is mildly interesting to follow and which I won't reveal here of course. The end is also predictable but it will be dear to very romantic hearts. Well this is not a great movie because the story is too simple for that, the characters are merely sketched and there is no deep insight of minds and behaviours.

The main character, Lucy, is a lonely, dreaming romantic, with whom I can easily relate. The Callaghan family, which she is suddenly and rapidly becoming a part of, is portrayed as the very opposite, though in a warm and loving manner. Maybe that is what appeals most to me in this movie; the romantic dream becomes a wish for a caring environment rather than for a perfect life.Watching this movie, one may find it unrealistic that a person as likeable as Lucy would ever need to be lonely, but the truth is that there are lots of real people just as likeable and just as lonely. This movie may give some hope.

Not of the family is convinced that she is who she says she is, especially Jack (Bill Pullman), who has designs on Lucy for himself. Through some funny, dramatic and painful moments, it all has A Happy Ending.Don't dwell too much on anything going on or question it.  It will ruin whatever enjoyment this movie holds.  Concentrate on the comedic turns by Glynis Johns, Michael Rispoli and Ally Walker.  Bullock is adequate to the movie and is believable in her big monologue when she explains why she did not come clean with the family. The character played by Peter Gallagher, who is in a coma for at least 3/4 of the movie, is the least appealing - he has pictures of himself in his wallet and in his apartment - what kind of guy does that, unless he's completely self-involved?

She knows nothing about this guy, except that he has a nice coat!  She has no family.

He instantly falls in love with Lucy. His face lights up when they meet. He glows like Annette Bening did in The American President. The chemistry between Pullman and Bullock is unbelievable. They should make more movies together! The family has this friend Saul, Jack Warden (Mighty Aphrodite + 97 other movies),  a guy that any family would like as family friend. He is like  part of the family. Michael Rispoli, plays Joe Fusco Jr., is the most lovable jerk you will ever meet! He is really good at this part.

I think that's probably because she really is the queen of romantic comedies and can do the feel good stuff in a way other actresses don't. While You were sleeping was one of her early ones and although it drags on a bit, is really a genuinely warm fun movie mainly because it combines three great things. One, it has romance-and plenty of it. Two, the characters are both fun and funny and very human in a way that many characters in movies such as this aren't. The people in While You were Sleeping are all so adorable without being larger then life or unrealistic. I liked that.Third, this movie is wittier then you might expect and every so often a line would be thrown in that actually had me roaring, which I didn't expect. I knew this would be complete feel good stuff just from the previews but I didn't expect the wit. And the funniest lines come so unexpectedly. I like romantic comedies that can do witty and feel good simultaneously. I also like screwball comedies much more then slapstick and this movie is built around that so it appealed to me.The movie is predictable as anything but interestingly even those I know who don't like romantic comedies seem to be charmed by this. I'm not sure why that is except maybe because there's such a likability about everyone in this movie and the premise was so original and Pullman(who I really like a lot as an actor) and Bullock are so natural together that the movie just appeals to many, even many of those who don't normally like romantic comedies.I was drawn to each and every character and liked the way everyone was developed-even Peter for the brief time he actually wasn't sleeping managed to have a developed personality and some really funny scenes. This movie isn't going to win any Oscars but for what it is, it's very much worth watching and a strong 7.5. Bullock's very good at doing these types of movies and this is one of her better ones.

Many of the funniest lines are said by minor characters (the hotel doorman, Joe jr., Peter's hospital room buddy). I look for this in other movies and don't see it much these days. Jon Turtletaub is a wonderful director.  Another one of my favorite movies that he directed is Disney's The Kid, which also has some great supporting roles.  I recommend that one too. This is Sandra at her best.  See this movie!

There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be adopted by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try.

Pullman makes a great clown, as in Ruthless People but should leave more serious roles alone. I think it's that silly toothless grin of his- he comes off too uptight. The hardest thing to believe about this movie is that Sandra wouldn't have anyone in her life! I could maybe imagine her working in a token booth. I've known other attractive women in real life who take on jobs that might be considered beneath them.

Sometimes this genre needs those elements to work. When director and writer can dose just right amount of sweetness and cuteness, they call it sense of style. While You Were Sleeping (1995), directed by Jon Turteltaubin, is good example of successful dosement. Pinch more and the soup would be spoilt. Charismatic and sympatic, but wrong kind of characters often choosing, Sandra Bullock plays this time in a suitable role as a metro ticketseller. Job isn't very interesting. All day long sitting in a small booth and getting cold. The ticketseller is little crushed on some handsome regular customer (Peter Callagher) who one day gets hurt. Crooks attacks at him on a platform, takes the money and throws the man on the rails.Fortunately the ticketseller sees that and saves the man when train is almost colliding with him. The man goes to a hospital, where doctors tell that he's in a coma. Patients family arrives to the hospital and assume that the ticketseller is mans girlfriend. The woman doesn't deny the misunderstanding and that way she gets to know the patients brother, Jack (Bill Pullman).Of  course here I could be cynical and ask, why on earth the woman doesn't fix the misunderstanding when it would demand only one sentence. Of course because then the plot would be messed up. The coma lasts exactly as long as the plot demands. But this is a movie. To this genre it is supposed to watch through the fingers and forgive the holes of the plot.Sandra Bullock and her character which she plays are so lovely, that you would not want to make bad faces to them. That is the reason why While You Were Sleeping works. When you care about the people of the movie, you care about the movie. It doesn't matter if the plot can't take closer observating. Bill Pullman is the the right partner for Bullock.

While You Were Sleeping came out a little after Sleepless in Seattle but holds onto the same old-fashioned story of love, romance and starry nights while mixing them with sentiment, smiles and big laughs.  And there are lots of all of these qualities here.Sandra Bullock....  Ahh, is there any red-blooded American man who can help but fall for her?  She's beautiful and strong-willed and just as confused about love as the rest of us.  Here she plays Lucy, a single subway attendant whose only wish is to see the world... and to catch the attention of a handsome man (Gallagher) she takes a subway token from each every morning.Then, in circumstances too myriad to get into, he falls into a coma and everyone, including his family, believes Lucy is his fiancee.  Then, her lonely life is changed forever by her adopted family and by the Vegetable's brother (Pullman), who suspects something fishy is going on but doesn't let that get in the way of his feeling strongly for Lucy, too.The whole cast is strong right down the line, including Boyle, Warden, Johns, Bernard, Rispoli (who is hilarious) and even Walker as Gallagher's ex-girlfriend who expected this kind of comedienne in TV's The Profiler?As far as its comparisons to Sleepless, it's justified to be sure, but for comedy quotient, Sleeping is the obvious winner.  Just watch when Gallagher comes out of his coma to see misunderstanding brought into a whole realm of comedic bravura all its own.Of course, true love wins out in the end and all is well with the world.  As if there were any doubt.  And Bullock becomes the love of every movie-going male's life.Nine stars for While You Were Sleeping, for the incurable romantic in all of us who also likes a good laugh once in a while.

Basically Lucy Eleanor Moderatz (Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock) a lonely ticket seller, and one day she sees the man of his dreams, but she also sees him get mugged. This mugging sends this man, known as Peter Callaghan (American Beauty's Peter Gallagher) into a coma, and when she goes to hospital to visit him, the nurse tells his family that Lucy is his fianc√©e. Lucy cannot get the courage to tell the truth, and the family, including Peter's father Ox (Peter Boyle), his mother Elsie (Glynis Johns), his godfather Saul (Jack Warden) (the only one who finds out her secret before everyone else), and his brother Jack Callaghan (Bill Pullman), have all taken her in as a (new) member of the family. While spending a lot of time with the family as Peter is still in the coma, Lucy is falling head over heels in love with Jack. Peter does eventually come out of his coma, and Lucy doesn't know what to do because he doesn't remember her, except go along with the idea that he is suffering very mild amnesia. Eventually, it seems Peter does accept that there should be a wedding, and he can see himself falling in love with Lucy as the years go by. So the big day comes, Lucy knows she truly loves Jack, but she doesn't know that before his coma, Peter proposed to another woman, so this is when Lucy confesses all, but says she fell in love with the family ever since the engagement. She does eventually get her happy ending, where she finds a new husband in Jack, and a new loving family. Also starring Michael Rispoli as Joe 'Joey' Fusco, Jr., Jason Bernard as Jerry Wallace, Micole Mercurio as Midge Callaghan and Ally Walker as Ashley Bartlett Bacon. With some good giggles, and a good message that love can be at first sight, but getting to know someone is the much better idea, this is a film you can't help but enjoy. Very good!

One day, a handsome gentleman falls on the tracks near her ticket booth. A train is rapidly approaching. Lucy jumps onto the tracks and pulls the man to safety. However, he hurt his head in the fall and is in a coma. Rushing to the hospital to see him, Lucy is mistaken for his fianc√©e and allowed into his hospital room. But, oh no, here comes his big family, including mother, father, sister, grandma, and a close neighbor. They are intrigued that their relative, Peter, never mentioned that he had become engaged. But, they also welcome Lucy with open arms, a welcome so big that lonely Lucy does not have the heart to tell them she is an impostor. But, what will happen when Peter decides to come out of his coma? And, when Lucy meets Peter's brother, Jack, is he already suspicious that she is not Peter's type? This is a lovely, lovely movie with a great cast. Bullock is very fine as the lonely lady, although, with her winning looks and personality, one could never imagine her being without a bevy of friends. The rest of the players, including Peter Gallagher, Bill Pullman, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden and Glynis Johns, is an absolutely marvelous ensemble that contributes highly to the film's enjoyment. Then, too, the script is quite clever and unusual, the costumes are well chosen, and the production values are top notch. Everyone who loves romantic comedies will not want to miss this one, no doubt. But, even those who think they can not stomach a chick flick will be enchanted by this loving and very funny movie.

Even the clich√©'d parts are cute. I might be childish but I do like the message -- dream men are sometimes very shallow and clueless, and their less charismatic, less perfect brothers (or friends or neighbors) are oftentimes much, much more inspiring once you get to know them. Fortunately for girls, the handsome clueless bunch usually spends a lot of time sleeping or otherwise misplacing or misdirecting their charms.The movie relies on a silly premise that a good-natured lie won't be discovered, and when discovered, it won't be ridiculed. However, this premise is treated fairly. The viewer doesn't feel stupid, as the lead character, Lucy, has a silly idea which leads her to the silly lie; so it isn't only the audience who is duped -- the audience is just asked to engage in Lucy's silly idea, and explore it as if it was just a dream. And at the end, it's all good for real - since Lucy doesn't need her silly idea anymore, you feel relieved of the whole silly premise.There is plenty of chemistry between lead characters which makes the romance believable.Who is this movie for?

I don't think it would work if it were in reverse.  Maybe if they make a few changes, it might.  Two sisters instead of two brothers?  What do you think?Anyway, since watching this film four years ago, and many times since then, I try to equate every romantic comedy I watch with this film.  Nothing could ever surpass it, in my opinion.  The nearest one is ONLY YOU starring Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, and a distant third is MRS. WINTERBOURNE, starring Ricki Lake, Brendan Fraser, and Shirley Maclaine.  Another one would be THE CUTTING EDGE, starring D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly.  So far, not even HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS, MAID IN MANHATTAN, and even PRETTY WOMAN can come close.  I've yet to find the next best romantic comedy.It's a good thing the Mr. LeBow and Mr. Sullivan took five long years to write this screenplay.  No wonder it became a hit, because they thought about it carefully.Bill Pullman is wonderful in this film!  I would love to see him so more romantic comedies in the future.  He has great comedic timing.  And Jason Bernard, who played Jerry, Lucy's supervisor, was unbelievably hilarious!  It's too bad he has already died.  He was a great talent.  I love the eccentric Callahan family, and the crazy neighbor (Joe Fusco, Jr.)  I would love to see a sequel (though, that's unlikely).

However, I (and my wife) found that the script simply lacked humour, using contrivance to make any progress (the ice scene is pure klutz) while potential resolutions or critical events were chopped or ignored as if the audience were expected to have its collective brain in neutral. Of the main characters not even the mostly comatose Peter seemed plausible in his role. Even the other woman was eventually rendered silly and pointless by the scriptwriter despite a promising start and enthusiastic approach by Ally Walker.Perhaps Julia Roberts should have taken this role and brought her scriptwriter with her. Her lightest comedies such as Runaway Bride are still better than this. I would not see this movie again nor recommend it but then, it will probably do you no great harm to see it for yourself when at least you can make up your own mind. It had a chance to work and it is a pity the execution failed.

Am I the one to blame? Perhaps but certainly not in the case of this vehicle. Problems enough here... Sandra Bullock looks pretty but she can't act, how else would you explain that she only will be remembered for Speed. Bill Pullman has the same appeal as the role he plays....exactly a carpenter! And then the scenes... First of all do they miss all sense of reality...girl who works in the metro sees a rich advocate who's beaten, he fells on the rails (no signs of any danger to be electrocuted!) and Sandra Bullock pushes him in pure Indiana Jonesstyle on the other side. Well, we saw scenes who were more stupid but at the hospital, some nurse introduces madame Bullock as his financee because otherwise she has no right to visit her prince charming. Don't ask me why but I still decided to watch further, perhaps I was in for torturing myself as the story goes on and on and gets more ridiculous...at the time the poor man is in coma (which is a good thing as Peter Gallagher is one of the most horrifying actors to look at) the family believes it all and poor Sandra becomes part of the family. But not her so called brother in law as he starts investigating if she's the real financee or not and look what happens...Sandra Bullock falls in love with mister Pullman. Okay no further revealing from plots (well if they can be called like that anyway) but the movie gets sillier and boring (and knowing the start was already terrible). This can be perhaps the ultimate movie for desperate women who wanna have their dose of romantic but for chrissakes  get a life....

The plot was more predictable than any other movie I've seen, and the acting in it was so monotonous, that I could barely stay awake. This movie was definitely a chick flick, if even any women could like it.  "},{"Title":"The Worst Movie Of 1995","Date":"13 June 2007","Score":"14 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I nominate this as the absolute worst film of the year for 1995, or at least The Dumbest Film of 1995. I remember taking this lady I was trying impress to see this film at the local theater, thinking it would be a good date movie since I had heard people were flocking to see it. Wow....both me and my then- girlfriend almost threw up leaving the theater. We both agreed this was the most ludicrous, stupid and over-hyped movie of the year. The fact this was a hit movie is a sad comment. Who can account for taste? Maybe the public was just desperate for a nice love story, even if it made no sense. Folks, this movie made NO sense. It was the dumbest story I have ever seen on film with the possible exception of the cult movie, Sorority Babes In The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama.Sandra Bullock was a great choice for the female lead, however, because nobody-but-nobody is more of a brainless bimbo on film than Miss Bullock....role after role. Add the stupid-sounding Bill Pullman and these two were made for this film.If I explained to you what this was about, you might not believe me. Check the Never Mind The Bullock review elsewhere here on the user comments. He explains it well.In over 3,000 reviews, I have never used the phrase worst movie of the year on any title, so take that as a warning if you have not seen this movie. Save yourself the money. "},{"Title":"A Great Love Story!","Date":"14 July 2001","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Sandra Bullock stars in this great love story about 'love at second sight'. Sandra plays Lucy, a lonely woman who works at a train station. For a few weeks a certain customer comes to the train station, she doesn't know him or anything and they have never spoken before but Lucy has fallen for him in a big way. One day, on Christmas, Lucy has to work and her dream man, (Who's called Peter, by the way.) comes in and is suddenly attacked and then falls on to the train track, which leaves Lucy to save him. When he taken to hospital he is unconscious. The whole family then seem to think that Lucy is Peter's fianc√©. Lucy can't bare to tell them the truth so the the rest of the film follows with everyone thinking Lucy is Peter's fianc√©. When Lucy meets Jack though, (Peters brother.) he doesn't think Lucy is all she seems. While You Were Sleeping is a great and very funny film and Sandra Bullock is wonderful as usual. I give the film a 20/10.  "}]
