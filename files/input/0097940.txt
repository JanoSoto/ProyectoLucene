[{"Title":"Elvis Lives!","Date":"4 November 2004","Score":"36 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" 'Mystery Train' is probably the most entertaining, interesting and understated of indie-fave Jim Jarmusch's early work (i haven't seen 'Coffee and Cigarettes' yet). The films portrayal of Elvis' birthplace of Memphis, possibly one of the most featureless, gritty and desolate representations of urban America ever committed to film, is a deceptively clever and substantial take on American subcultures.Without doubt, it is the first of the films three vignettes that makes the film stand out a little more than Jarmusch's other quirky offerings. Two Japanese tourists besotted with the King's legacy and 1950's American retro-culture in general, decide to visit Memphis, where they experience the superficiality his iconic status has been reduced to. The over-excitable and optimistic teenage girl, along with her more austere, cooler-than-cool boyfriend, are equally unimpressed with what the town has to offer. It's quite impressive that 15 years after its release, Jarmusch's depiction of alternative culture manages to capture the pretentious but proudly on-the-edges attitudes probably more apparent in today's retro-obsessed climate than ever before.Jarmusch's signature eclectic cast is another reason for repeated viewing, the subtleties of, in particular, Steve Buscemi's stuttering and nervous performance, are worth looking out for. As is the linking theme of Elvis' ghost in all three vignettes, a brilliant example of how to take a simple theme, and continually parodize its implications until its every mention leads to some sort of in-joke. The cool, laid-back pace of the film allows the humour to hit you unexpectedly, and the timing is often genius. Very, very, very watchable.

Continuing his tradition of casting musicians as actors, he enlists Joe Strummer as a British Elvis and the late Screamin' Jay Hawkins as the hotel night clerk. R&B great Rufus Thomas appears in the train station, and Tom Waits is the voice of the radio DJ. John Lurie provides the score, along with a fabulous soundtrack of classic Memphis music (from Elvis Presley to the Bar-Kays). The stories are intertwined, with certain events being shown from the perspective of each of the three sets of characters. The town has fallen a bit since its heyday as a musical hotbed, but the spirits of its past can be sensed in the delapidated buildings and landscapes, all lovingly embraced by Jarmusch's lens. All of the night shots were actually filmed at night, and some scenes are subtitled in Japanese and Italian. As is typical with Jarmusch's work, the action unfolds at a leisurely pace, and not without some humor. The film's juxtaposing of cultures is a popular theme with the director, and one he would use again in his next anthology piece, Night On Earth.

Serious and funny at the same time.  I like the layout of the picture, how all the people's live inter-mingled without touching each other and time started over when the next group of people started their adventure.Made in 1989, this movie still lives today, just like Elvis!  Actually, this movie will be around for a very long time.  With quirky being the norm for TV and movies now, it fits into the current movie atmosphere even more.  I think this one fell in between the time of Twin Peaks & Northern Exposure on network TV and Six Feet Under and Dead Like Me on cable movie channels. This one ranks way up there with Momento as one of my favorite movies.

While all of them (even Dead Man and Year of the Horse, movies that boggled my mind with how strange they were) carry a level of off-beat, original, and fresh kind of film-making prowess, I think my favorite (hard to say 'best' with this director) is with this film, Mystery Train. Plot-wise, it's the obvious precursor to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (and it's understandable that QT saw this- he did, after all, include Elvis as a practical spiritual adviser for Clarence in True Romance, beside the point). The idea behind both films is very similar, but of course executed in entirely different trajectories - one person or place has a level of importance for what will happen to the characters in the film (with 'Pulp' it was Marsellus Wallace; with 'Mystery' it's the Hotel run by Screaming' Jay Hawkins, and the song Blue Moon on radio). On its own terms, Mystery Train comes out entertaining if one doesn't want to think about the timing of the plot, even if that is carefully, almost architecturally constructed.Although the second and third stories are linked by character associations, the first is a stand-alone segment that looks like if it was just on paper could make for a calm, witty short story. As it is in the film, the Japanese couple Far from Yokohama featuring actors Masatoshi Nagase and Yôki Kudô, is an inviting first part of the film, almost entirely in Japanese subtitles, and playing off of the lady's love of Elvis, and the guy's quiet love for Carl Perkins (a name I didn't really know until I asked around). A steady pace is kicked off by Jarmusch, working more on mood than on a conventional story, and it is something that works rather well. Interesting still is how he sets up other little bits with supporting characters as the leads unfurls- this being an occasional couple of lines between Hawkins and down-beat bellboy Cinque Lee (there are also very quick shots of Steve Buscemi as a barber, the only small connection to the other two stories, and Rufus Thomas at the station). Sometimes the couple bicker, but never with a rush of intensity, and when the scene comes to a passionate close, it's really wonderful how it can be touching at being subtle.The second story, Ghost, is faster, with more of a high-key for humor. Nicoletta Braschi (Roberto Benigni's wife in most films as in life) is astray in Memphis on a flight, and instead of seeking out Elvis gets it delivered to her in a vision while in a hotel room with a talky Jersey Girl (Elizabeth Bracco). It's a complete kind of surreal scene that acts as the fine top-off to a set of odder circumstances that bring her to the hotel (in particular Tom Noonan in one of the funniest small roles I've seen in any Jarmusch film). Once again, the little things keep this thing floating with a stack of magazines, and of course, all that music on the radio.The third story, Lost in Space, is when Jarmusch turns up the energy, which means not as far as you might expect. What he does get is a kind of three-character triangle that some-what reminded me of a sequence in The Last Detail three characters that are totally smashed, with nothing else except to crash in the hotel. But with this story, two performances shine through unexpectedly Joe Strummer as a fuming, gun-toting Brit and Steve Buscemi in his early days as his brother in-law. The climax to this scene- in essence the climax to the whole film- is one that is on par, at least comparable, to the climax of Pulp Fiction, as a wild, dead-serious and dead-funny accumulation of events tying things together.Two facets that make Jarmusch's vision work are, for one thing, that he has Robby Mueller, a bit of a God in the world of modern European cinematographers. His scenes are lit sometimes with all the realism and fantasy of a European fantasy film, but also with a careful eye in composition and getting unusual angles on things a simple as photographing two people in bed or a person walking alone with Memphis in the backdrop. The other facet includes the city itself, with its quality of attracting and leading in people who are unique to the city, and (sometimes) particular to the music. On top of Jarmusch regular John Lurie on the guitar and harmonica, he brings in songs that remind me how much I can get into this kind of music with the right setting. They- Elvis, Orbison, and Sam Phillips among others- contribute just as much as the actors do. Mystery Train may be one of the quintessential 80's indie films (which can be said of Stinger than Paradise and Down by Law as well), that welcomes anyone who might be interested to watch, and if you don't like it, it's not at the worst offensive to taste. It's a keen film on people, music, and devotion.

Great performances are dished out (Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Cinque Lee are hilarious in an argument over exotic fruits from foreign lands) all around, but I favor the dynamic duo of Youki Kudoh and Masatoshi Nagase.  Their characters are far from Yokohama, but love will find its way to Tennessee.  The lighting of a cigarette, an impressive t-shirt collection, an argument over the merits of Carl Perkins versus The King, the smearing of some crimson lipstick, and an exhilarating invitation to bed -- the minutiae of a special bond beyond mere chemistry.  The combination of Nagase's dour, glowering sourpuss and Kudoh's charming, enthusiastic pixie makes for a volcanic cocktail.

The cast includes cult performers like Tom Noonan (the serial killer in Michael Mann's Manhunter), Steve Buscemi, and singer Tom Waits (heard on the radio), and it is directed by one of America's leading independent directors.  Mystery Train is possibly Jim Jarmusch's most immaculate film, and though the movie gets steadily darker in its comic tone, it is his least bleak work to date.  The patterning is precise, the film growing richer as the three strands are finally woven together, or perhaps unwoven, as the characters go their separate ways.  Robbie Muller, the great Dutch cameraman who shot Alex Cox's Repo Man and Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas, once more brings an outsider's perspective to the American landscape, giving the night scenes and hotel interiors a Hopperesque look and endowing a dilapidated section of Memphis with an elegaic sadness.

The three episodes that make up the movie are told separately and in their entirety, though they happen simultaneously in time, and share nothing more than a common local which serves as the hub around which the stories revolve.  And with them, Jarmusch does what he does best  he invites the audience in to share some time with the individuals who populate his landscape, as he places them under the microscope to study the minutiae of their lives.  In his hands, the details of everyday existence become fresh and new, like the first time you see a new city or make the acquaintance of a total stranger who forever after becomes a part of your life.  It's an intimate style of filmmaking, almost voyeuristic, wherein the camera becomes the eyes of the audience and makes the viewer more than a mere onlooker; it places you in the scene, which allows you to experience what the characters are experiencing, to live what they are living.  When someone is walking down the street, you're on that street with them, feeling the pavement beneath your feet; in the train depot, you drink in the atmosphere, feeling the texture of the walls, of the aged wood of the benches, smelling the age-old scents of time that hang on the air.  You're there with the young couple from Japan, in Memphis to see Sun Studios and Graceland; and with the young widow from Rome, passing through with the casket of her late husband awaiting transport at the airport; and with three young men who have too much to drink and within a few hours find out how quickly life can become so complicated. 	Jarmusch works with such precision that it makes everything that happens seem spontaneous; it's an innate sense of knowing what works, and how to make that necessary connection with the audience by making all that transpires real.  He's a skilled craftsman who knows what he wants and exactly how to deliver it.  He creates the proper atmosphere, then introduces you to the characters through which his story will be told.  And once the stage is set, Jarmusch knows that `who' these people are and what makes them unique is as important as the story itself, for in a sense, the characters `are' the story.  It's an examination of human nature; of traits and of how people function under certain circumstances.  And through each character the viewer gets a different perspective on what is happening, along with some insight into how we all relate to one another in a given situation, from the mundane to the bizarre.   	To tell his tale, Jarmusch has assembled a talented, eclectic cast of actors, including Masatoshi Nagase (Jun) and the charismatic Youki Kudoh (Mitsuko), the couple from Japan with opposing perspectives of Memphis; Nicoletta Braschi (Luisa), the widow awaiting a flight back to Rome; Elizabeth Bracco (Dee Dee), a young woman whose life is in transition; Tom Noonan (Man in Diner), a man with a menacing presence and a strange tale to tell; Steve Buscemi (Charlie), a regular guy led astray by trusting indifference, along with Rick Aviles (Will Robinson) and Lowell Roberts (Lester); Stephen Jones, a dead-ringer for Elvis who is extremely effective here as his ghost; and the two whose characters are pivotal to the story, Screamin' Jay Hawkins (Hotel Night Clerk), and Cinque Lee (The Bellboy).  And--heard, but not seen-- Tom Waits (Voice of the Radio DJ).  Thoroughly engrossing and highly entertaining, `Mystery Train' is vintage Jarmusch; a director whose minimalist techniques and style make for a satisfying and rewarding movie-going experience.  He will not dazzle you with ILM F/X or feed you endless lines of witty dialogue; instead, he gives you more  A film that is artistically and cleverly rendered, with an engaging story and characters that are `real.'  An independent filmmaker who stays true to his personal `vision,' Jarmusch gives you that which is rarely found in Hollywood.  A film that is truly original.  I rate this one 8/10.

I saw Night on Earth and Ghost Dog, and I was very impressed with those two films.  I wasn't too impressed with Dead Man, but I still felt curious to check out this movie.  Mystery Train moves along at a pace identical to that of Night on Earth.  It has those usual Jarmusch trademarks  characters from a foreign country, culture clashes, episodic rhythm, etc.  Jarmusch is a very talented screenwriter, and he's good at engaging his audience with dialogue that is crisp (and sometimes quite funny) but at the same time brutally realistic.  You can never watch a Jarmusch film and say to yourself, Man, people don't talk like that in real life!  Though highly identical to Night on Earth, I found that film much more engaging in comparison, and I could've help but ponder that while watching this movie.  Don't get me wrong, I liked Mystery Train, but NOE had a certain quality that made it a lot more entertaining, despite the fact that it was two hours long (give or take).  I guess I just found the interactions between the characters in that movie more interesting.  In this film, I found them interesting as well, but the scenes would drag out at points.  Both films move at a leisurely pace, but the minutes seem to go by slower when watching this one.  Nevertheless, it was well-made, with some nice uses of 3-figure composition.  Jarmusch makes good use of the camera, preventing us from feeling like we're watching a photographed play--even though many scenes fixate on one location.  The soundtrack is cool, and it's interesting how Jarmusch used The King to tie the stories together.  The performances are good, and one of my main curiousities--before viewing the film--was seeing Steve Buscemi in one of his early roles.  I love Steve, he's one of our coolest actors. Overall, I recommend the film.  It definitely has its moments.  I just thought it dragged at points, and if you had the choice between this movie and Night on Earth, I recommend you choose the latter.

The movie is about three different stories which are taking place in the same place at the same time (at night in some cheap motel). Jim Jarmusch is really good in telling different stories who are connected one to each other and also in this case he's doing a great job. The characters in the movie are very realistic, likable and you can feel connected to them despite the fact they're always in some bizarre troubles. Mystery train is another movie which shows the life of common people, but I think this is his funniest movie, just before Night on earth. The humor is fresh and unpredictable, very warm and realistic. The movie consists of three different stories Far from Yokohama - the first story of a young Japanese couple, obsessed with Elvis Presley. From the beginning very humorous clip, but both man and woman were really annoying for my taste and after a while this clip became boring and uninteresting, especially the last clip with sex scene in hotel.Ghost - I liked this one. Very funny, somewhere scary with the story of the ghost of Elvis Presley haunting the city, but overall a really good clip. The appearance of Elvis was very funny and the dialog between two main female characters were also great.Lost in space - The best clip. Funny and sad at the same time. Steve Buscemi is really funny in this clip, also Joe Strummer was very convincing character. The way this clip ends is one of the best movie scenes I've ever seen - the characters running away from the police, despite the fact that the police are not looking for them. The best clip in the whole movie.In all three clips I especially liked Tom Waits and his voice as a DJ on a local radio. Overall, Mystery Train is a funny movie, with a lot of drama, comedy and memorable scenes. Jarmusch is really a genius of making movies and this one proves it.

Like all of Jarmusch's films, its very low-key humor. Unlike other many other films that attempt dry humor however (such as Napoleon Dynamite), Mystery Train is often hilarious because of how seemingly apathetic the characters react to some of the situations. Jarmusch's direction is very minimalist, but it suits the material perfectly. No other filmmaker outside of possibly Monte Hellman can do minimalist film-making consistently so well. Admittedly, this kind of drama-comedy isn't for all tastes, but if you're interested in Jarmusch, this may be a good starting place.In addition to the hilarious dry comedy, the film is very unassuming and enjoyable because of that. All of the characters are great and often very likable. Its leisurely paced (as with all of Jarmusch's films), but entertaining despite of that. Sure, after the film is done it feels a bit pointless (there really isn't any running themes between the stories outside of the hotel). However, its easy to see why this has become a cult classic. It holds up very well on repeat viewings. I guess like all cult films, its an either you love it or hate it kind of thing. Personally, I love this little film.

Money is spent, hearts are broken, a gunshot rings, the jukebox plays. When everybody else is playing it cool, Steve Buscemi is the soul of the story as Charlie the Barber, a coward with a heart of gold.

The film consists of three independent but interlocking vignettes which take place in a Memphis hotel run by Screamin' Jay Hawkins with the help of bellboy Cinque Lee.In the first scene, young Japanese tourists Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) and Jun (Matsatoshi Nagase) pass through Memphis to see the monuments of 1950s rock 'n' roll. Their relationship isn't going so well, evoking tragedy. The second vignette introduces us to a recently widowed Italian woman (Nicoletta Braschi) who has to spend a night in town before she can depart with her husband's coffin. Finally, the third vignette follows the post-layoff bender of a couple of newly unemployed locals (Joe Strummer, Rick Aviles) and a local barber (Steve Buscemi). In spite of armed robbery and murder, this is actually the most straight-up funny portion of the film. It's a typical Buscemi part of a nice guy caught up in scandalous events beyond his control, and Joe Strummer has a gift for comedic acting. Between these three plot lines, we are treated to great deadpan interludes between Hawkins and the bellboy.Some filmmakers evoke the natural beauty of their country. Who doesn't want to visit the windswept coasts of Bergman's Sweden or the feverish urban nights of the Italian auteurs? Jarmusch's first three films, on the other hand, portray the United States as a blight of weeds, empty streets, graffiti and failing infrastructure. American by birth, I left the US years ago and this film only makes me grateful I did. But even if the landscape is hideous, with its fairly harmonious relationship of characters of different races, MYSTERY TRAIN does depict a beautiful society that I hope is out there somewhere.I wouldn't rank MYSTERY TRAIN as highly as certain other Jarmusch films. The three stories here are clearly independently conceived, and though they are reconciled into a single plot, the film as a whole doesn't seem so epic. The middle vignette is rather lightweight, although Tom Noonan's bit as a scam artist is creepy and memorable. Still, the film is entertaining and fairly well put-together, and the visuals provide a new strong aspect that one doesn't find in the two earlier efforts. MYSTERY TRAIN was Jarmusch's first film in colour and he chose a lovely cool palette that jars with Screamin' Jay Hawkins' electric red suit.

I really like strange comedies about weird characters and bizarre situations, especially if they are done as good as in this film. It's very well acted, beautifully shot and most importantly it has very sharp and witty writing that for me made this film, that and Youki Kodoh's performance.I usually don't like these films that are split into segments. Mostly because many filmmakers use it as an excuse to avoid any meaningful character development and cohesive storytelling. Unlike those hacks like Tarantino, Jarmusch gives us three interesting stories with colorful and very likable characters. My favorite by far was the Japanese couple, mainly because of Youki Kudoh who was so adorable, cute and likable. She was the most likable character I have seen in film since Jun Ji-Hyun in My Sassy Girl, Windstruck and Daisy. The rest of the cast were great too but she just stole the show for me.If I had to complain about something, then the only thing that came to mind was the fact that Jarmusch could have made entire film centered around the first segment. I just loved the first segment so much, I was sad that there wasn't more.Mystery Train was a blast to watch and it was far more entertaining than most of the big, stupid action films I have seen. If you enjoy watching some small indie films with good writing, great cast and amazing soundtrack, this is your kind of film.

Like other Jarmusch films it's a deadpan, deadbeat sampling of offbeat Americana, seen by outsiders on the inside looking out an Elvis-idolizing Japanese tourist and her cool, catatonic boyfriend; a young Italian widow who receives a ghostly visitation from the King; and an expatriate English drop-out bearing an unfortunate resemblance to the Man From Memphis. It's certainly the most tightly controlled of the director's features to date, but at the same time the most relaxed and disarming. All the action (what little there is) takes place in and around a dilapidated downtown hotel over the course of a single night, with each episode occurring simultaneously but told in sequence, connected only by the repetition of otherwise incidental details. It may not add up to anything more than a shaggy dog joke, but (in its own offhand way) the film works, with Robby Muller's atmospheric photography providing a wonderfully effective after-hours ambiance.

He is very interesting, and clearly not into putting out something mainstream. Cultural differences, superficiality and relationships are explored. Editing and cinematography(with long takes and often little movement to the camera) are subtle and remain hidden; not manipulating us, merely objectively showing the events, not judging. The focus is on the characters, all of them well-written and credible. In Memphis, we meet two Japanese tourists(a lot of truth about how people behave when visiting other countries), an Italian woman and a couple of people who live there. It's worth noting how much they talk about pop culture; arguing if Elvis or Perkins was better, what old television show they like, and other superficial things. The thing is not that these people have no problems, or that they don't, at least deep down, realize this; it's that they don't feel like they can solve them, and maybe even admitting that they're there seems like it will just make it hurt more. They are all very human and you can relate to them. This consists of three stories, connected by a couple of things. The humor is great, very discreet. I especially enjoyed Steve... well, Buscemying. Noonan is amazing, as well. The acting is spot-on for most, really. Dialog is important in this; what is said and what isn't. There is a bit of strong language and one sex scene(no nudity, not graphic, mainly moaning and movement) in this. I recommend this to every fan of dramas who do not need visual tricks to sustain their attention. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Thank you, Thank you very much","Date":"10 December 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" There are three things I can honestly say I've never experienced.

Tom Waits does have a way with words and Jarmusch certainly has a way with consciousness. Mystery Train' is the third film by director Jim Jarmusch and as he describes it its the third film of a trilogy. The other two films were Stranger then Paradise and Down by Law. The connection that links these films together is the theme of cross-cultural influence and miscommunication. It is probably more accurate to observe all of Jarmusch's films as one continuous thought process much in the same intuitive style as Wim Wenders's films.Mystery Train is one of the most poignant films of Jim Jarmusch's career because it suggests a little of everything in his world of metaphors Religion, rock and roll, racism, being cool, and cultural politics. Who is the king? Elvis Presley or Carl Perkins? Why is Elvis so famous when all his music came from black artists like Junior Parker and Rufus Thomas? These questions are not answered in Mystery Train but they are addressed like random thoughts which pass by like cars on a train. In fact the film does not feel serious like most drama's are. Its more of an off beat comedy. The film is set up like a journey on a train divided into three separate stories that find their way in the same location. The first story involves two Japanese tourists who plan on visiting Graceland but instead get sidetracked by wandering into Sun Studios. They smoke cigarettes and contemplate on Elvis Presley and the birthplace of rock and roll. The second story is about a neurotic girl who complains about her boyfriend Elvis and a dreamy Italian widow who see's a ghost in the middle of the night . The last story Lost in Space is about the boyfriend Elvis and two other friends who drive around drunk and later get in trouble with the law.As with all of Jarmusch's films, the plot is never as important as the details and nuances. It is not difficult to miss these elements as Jarmusch plays with them in very ironic ways. We also get a strong sense of atmosphere where much of the landscape in this town is demolished and shabby like the photographs in Robert Frank's The Americans. There is also an amazing cast of musicians from Screamin jay Hawkins, Joe Strummer, a guest appearance by Rufus Thomas and a disc jockey voice by Tom Waits. This sounds much like the same disc jockey Tom Waits played in Down By Law. And Screamin Jay Hawkins's put a spell on Jarmusch's first film Stranger the Paradise as his presence does here. There are all kinds of details one can ponder on or shrug off. The beauty of this is that Jim Jarmusch never pulls you by the hair to tell you what to think about. It is left for the audience to interpret it and to allow the chips fall where they may. For many viewers that can be an irritating ordeal but on the other hand it can also be totally refreshing. Mystery Train has a strange rhythm but as far as the story goes, it moves at just the right beat.

But more than the dialogue, just as his other works, there is no necessity for the characters being Japanese or Italian or even American. They are all just travellers of the universe. There is no stereo type and still Jarmusch doesn't leave a single space for us to ask shouldn't there be some explanation?.

Set in Memphis, Tennessee, it oozes  atmosphere with great location shots, and a great soundtrack. The film includes many lines of dialogue in foreign languages, such as  Japanese and Italian, thankfully subtitles are provided. We start off with a duo of Japanese travellers, who are Far from Yokohama.  They are travelling around the U.S simply to visit important sites in rock  and roll history. This story was my personal favourite, because it set up  the inter-weaving elements of each story. Both of the actors in this story  were played well, especially the super-cool male Jun who oozed style. The  tourists stumble into a seedy hotel, and set-up the rest of the  movie.Secondly, we join an Italian lady, stuck in Memphis after an airplane  mishap. She also finds her way to the seedy hotel, after being ripped off  and conned by some unsavoury elements. At the hotel, she meets Dee-Dee, and  they end up sharing a room together. A supernatural encounter, alluded to  earlier in this story, takes place and is quite entertaining.Finally, we meet up with 3 crooks, quite predictably actually, since a  certain sound was heard in the previous two stories (you'll see what I mean  when you watch the film). This story I felt was the weakest of the 3,  starting off slow, and providing a flaky finish to an otherwise great film.  All through the movie, we also meet the seedy hotel's bellboy and concierge,  who provide some comic relief, and hold the 3 stories together.  I recommend this film whole-heartedly, it's quite a fun ride. You'll have a  great time picking out the common elements in each of the 3 stories, and by  the 3rd story, I guarantee you will know what is about to be said as soon  as the crooks get into their hotel room, trust me ) "},{"Title":"Worth watching for the cast","Date":"20 September 2004","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Steve Buscemi, Joe Strummer and Maiku Hama (Masatoshi Nagase) - together at last!Unfortunately, in this instance, the cast are let down by a less than inspiring script.

I hope Jim Jarmusch is making money with his movies, because I'd like to see more. So far I've seen this one, The Limits of Control and Down by Law, and they're all good. They're originals. He takes it nice and easy, not rushed or anything, and we get an excellent sense of place and people.The first vignette in this one brought back so many memories. I've never been in Memphis but much of it reminded me of other dusty and rusty towns elsewhere. There's a Japanese couple doing their homemade tour of places where famous singing idols worked and recorded. My wife and I did Europe the exact same way, for 40 days, each of with a bag. No reservations. No planned itinerary. No guides. Like the couple in the movie, we'd arrive by train and walk or do a bus. We'd find a hotel like this couple, and they'd often be cheap like this one, and it would also be near the train station. And she'd be taking the pictures of the hotel room or whatever it happened to be whereas the boy is doing it in this picture.The second vignette is a girl from Rome and some of the characters she encounters, which links to the third vignette which has some guys.Meanwhile, there are a good many black characters who appear, sometimes briefly, and show us a bit of America's black culture. This again rings bells for me, as I'm white and my wife is black, so I've been immersed in the black culture often. And Mr. Jarmusch's writing and direction brings us an accurate and amusing picture of some of this unique culture.Watching this is like getting some ice cream with a distinctive flavor. The photography is great as part of it, not to mention the characters in the stories.

His films are often held up as anti-Hollywood depictions of America as truth. Which is too bad. Jarmusch draws his world inhabited by little more than cartoon caricatures. As a comedy this works to some degree. I've heard fans say his films portray truth, but if so that truth might just be that life is circular, offering little capacity for emotional commitment or change. There are few authentic, multidimensional characters in this comedy. The film uses this to advantage, and there is def. a small but dedicated market that enjoys this sort of film.Of course if you're reading this you probably already know the structure of the film. Comedy built on a multi-plot design, with predominantly mini-plot elements. The film plays 3 stories, skeletally interwoven in time (the radio dj sequences), space (the hotel), and by relationships (a couple recently broken-up). Interesting at times, boring at times, this viewer is glad the film and others in the anti-Hollywood genre exist, but there may be a room in hell where a they play over and over for eternity. "},{"Title":"Jim Jarmusch's Definite Precursor to Night On Earth","Date":"19 September 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" The opening shots of Jim Jarmusch's new film show two young Japanese tourists in a faded Amtrak coach, listening to their Walkmans as the train pulls through the edge of Memphis. The girl is an Elvis fan. Her boyfriend believes Carl Perkins was the real founder of rock 'n' roll. They have come to see the shrines of Memphis such as Sun Records. In other hands, this pattern would head straight into cultural satire, into a comic knock on rock tourism, with a sardonic destination at Graceland as the punchline. But, though he is a natural at dry goofiness, Jarmusch is not quite as much a comedian as an idealist, who sees America as an immigrant might, as a bizarre, nostalgic country where the urban landscapes are painted by Robert Henri and the all-night blues stations supply a soundtrack for life.The tourists arrive in Memphis and haul their luggage through the yawning train station, and walk to the Sun studios, where a guide babbles on with her pitch about Presley and Perkins faster than an auctioneer could. Then they check into one of those flop joints that has grown tired waiting for the traveling salesmen who no longer come. This is a hotel out of a 1940s noir, with neon signs and a linoleum lobby, and a night clerk who is surprised by nothing and a bellboy whose eyes are so broad, he might be seeing everything for the first time. Other people will check into this hotel during the movie's lasting night of intricacy.The soundtrack is from a local radio station, and Elvis' version of Blue Moon is heard at some point during all three segments of the narrative, supplying a collective bond, as does an offscreen gunshot. And so does the ghost of Elvis, who appears to habituate the movie with his sound and his mythology, and who materializes to an Italian widow played by Nicoletta Braschi. Jarmusch believes in an American landscape that took place before city spread, before the reliable fruitlessness of the fast-food strips on the highways leading into town, saloons where everybody knows each other, diners where the short-order cook is in charge, and landscapes across railroad tracks to a hotel where vagabonds are not only greeted, they are known.This indie tapestry is Jarmusch's third major film, after Stranger than Paradise and Down by Law, and definitely a precursor to his next film, Night On Earth, which is more solidly an anthology and explores the entire world at random. In all three there is the conviction that America cannot be nimbly encased into conservative and reassuring shopping assemblies, that there must be a life of the night for the drifters and the dropouts, the heroes of no permanent address and no evident vocational position. However indeed their lives may be horizontal and bare, in Jarmusch's conception they are the true residents of the city, mainly after midnight.Speaking of the film as if separate from the universe of the Jarmusch filmography, this uncommon genre-less universalistic film, an anthology film that upon reflection does not seem like three stories but one, is not a traditional plot, and it is not how the story ends that is essential, but how it endures. It is inhabited by dozens of minute, oddly contemplated bits of behavior, such as the rapport between Screamin' Jay Hawkins' hilarious night clerk and Cinque Lee's bellboy, or between the two teenage Japanese tourists, whose whole idea of what America is like is fashioned out of the sum of ideas, perspectives, attitudes and images of the mainstream. The greatest element about this almost antiquated album is that it takes you to an America you sense that you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you just knew where to look. A place of people who are permitted to be personas, to be themselves. The train is the foolproof synecdoche in this movie. It's not where it's been that's of value, or even where it's going.

I enjoyed particularly the first story which depicted the Japanese couple on a discovery tour of Memphis, here Jarmush's interest for the human's behaviour is evident as the couple relationship, although it might seem to be almost comical, is in fact a quite realistic stereotyipical representation of a Japanese relationship.Definitely worth watching it if you are into independent no mainstream films.

I didn't love Coeurs, but thought it was technically impressive and admired most of all Resnais' mise-en-scene, and it thankfully made me interested in seeing more Resnais films. On the other hand, Mystery Train, which coincidentally also has interconnecting stories, was a real disappointment. I'll say this right now I didn't 'get' this movie, I don't understand why it's acclaimed, and it didn't exactly make me want to see more Jarmusch films, especially as he is supposedly an auteur, suggesting that his writing for other films, or at least most of his other films, would be similar to this.I didn't think this film was impressive at all on any technical scale. It's not 'simple' or 'understated', it's borderline simplistic, or at least seemed so to me. Jarmusch's approach to the film is thoroughly conventional and expected in every scene, there was nothing interesting about the mise-en-scene, nothing special about his approach whatsoever. Moreover, it's not even an especially well-shot film by normal Hollywood standards, just 'solid'. My real problem with the film however was the writing. I found it to be truly poor for much of the film. The opening segment with the Japanese couple is the epitome of pretentious quirk, something which is only emphasized by the lead actor's awful stare-and-pause-between-words approach, which I'd also blame on Jarmusch. I don't even think there should be a 'point' to things necessarily, but I've rarely seen anything so self-congratulatory and for what? Wow, you wrote a silly story about Japanese caricatures in Memphis filled with borderline racist jokes which have been used in movies for decades! Whoop-de-doo! The second story is better, but still undeserving of the film's reputation. An Italian tourist in Memphis is tricked into buying a stack of magazines, a con-man attempts to cheat her out of 20 bucks with an Elvis ghost story, then she ends up at the hotel which connects the three stories, shares a room with an annoying American, and sees Elvis' ghost. At least it's entertaining. The third story should've been better, but again, the caricatures get progressively more annoying and the quirky, self-congratulatory, 'clever' humor is just unbearable. This isn't far removed from the sort of 'indie comedy' which is ruining the movies for anyone with a sense of humor, and it has made further adventures in Jarmusch-land a worrying prospect. Ugh. I'm pretty sure this movie's reputation is almost entirely built on it being 'cool' due to the soundtrack, Screamin' Jay Hawkins (who IS cool), etc, but you know what? The billionth time that Japanese idiot mentioned Carl Perkins I wished I was listening to Carl Perkins. If this is the work of a great director... Godard did make King Lear, that gives me some hope.

The last segment is arguably the best, mainly because at least it does have some sort of plot and features the likes of Joe Strummer (yeah, the one from The Clash) and Steve Buscemi. There are some funny lines in there, and Vondie Curtis-Hall (who would go on to direct Gridlock'd) is pretty awesome in it as well. Most people actually disagree with this though and like the first segment far more, but I couldn't get into it all. It features two Japanese tourists...being Japanese tourists for 40 minutes. Writer/Director Jim Jarmusch does give them some interesting traits and it's a cute couple, but 40 minutes of this? It's not like this is all setting up something, they have nothing to do with the rest of the segments. I'll take Joe Strummer robbing a liquor store any time. The second segment is probably the least interesting to discuss, because most people aren't particularly fond of it and neither am I. It's not filler, but it's not very entertaining either. Mystery Train didn't thrill me nearly as much as I thought it would, but I guess the last segment does make it worthwhile.

It's told in three vignettes of varying interest, but shot with an eye for detail and a deep interest in character. The movie is heavy on atmosphere, as noted with many of the shot choices and as heard on the terrific soundtrack. The city of Memphis is clearly the main character, and perhaps gives purpose to the slow pace of the piece. It tends to drag, but the visual nature and overall charm of several of the characters is enough to keep the viewer propelled forward. Top it off with a fantastic characterization by Screamin' Jay Hawkins as a hotel desk clerk, and this is an easily recommended film.

The movie starts out with a young Japanese couple on a train going to Memphis,Tennessee to see Elvis's hometown. They speak in Japanese and their are no subtitles on the DVD so unless you speak Japanese you won't be able to understand what they say. They wind up staying a really cheap hotel and then the movie goes to an Italian lady in the same city but it isn't really clear what she is doing in Memphis and she winds up staying in the same hotel as the Japanese couple. Then the movie shows a drunk man in a bar waving a gun around and his friends come and get him and they also wind up staying in the same hotel. It's a great movie and probably one of Jarmusch's best movies.

An Elvis motif runs through all the episodes, which are set mostly in a rundown hotel during one night (Blues legend Screaming Jay Hawkins plays the clerk). In the first episode, a young Japanese couple arrives in the town which gave birth to rock and roll (she is quirky, he is impassive; she loves Elvis, he Carl Perkins). In the second episode, an Italian woman (Niccoleta Braschi) whose husband has just died has to spend a night in Memphis. She shares the room in the hotel with a talkative American woman (Elizabeth Bracco). During the night, she imagines or sees the ghost of Elvis. In the third episode, a British guy who is called Elvis by his lowlife friends, and who has just broken with the woman of the second episode (and is played by the late Clash guitarist Joe Strummer) more or less accidentally shots a liquor shop seller, and has to take refuge in the hotel, along with his brother in law (played by Steve Buscemi). A gunshot heard during the night sort of links the three episodes. Nothing much happens, but Jarmusch shows his love with American pop culture and his fine ear for the way the American working class talk everyday.

A Japanese couple are indifferent to how important it is to see Sun Studios and Graceland. A shooting victim is the center of a comical, but stressful situation. Soundtrack features songs actually recorded at the legendary Sun Studios on Union Avenue Domino by Roy Orbison, Memphis Train by Rufus Thomas, Blue Moon by Elvis Presley, Pain in My Heart by Otis Redding and others. Plus there is a double dose of the title song Mystery Train by both Junior Parker and Elvis.This quirky Jim Jarmusch project features Masatoshi Nagase, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Elizabeth Bracco, Steve Buscemi, Rick Aviles, Cinque Lee, Rufus Thomas and the voice of Tom Waits. Buscemi's character can't be ignored...superb example of nerve wrecking. Most outstanding characters are Hawkins as the hotel night clerk and his obnoxious bellboy Lee. Looking for something different? Take a trip to the underbelly of Memphis on the Mystery Train.

Unfortunately, watching Mystery Train, I feel the same distance that I have felt watching most of his other films. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful things about Mystery Train, and, overall, I liked it more than I did Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law. But I always felt like I should be liking it a lot more, and I just never felt much more than a nice affection for the movie. The film contains three segments about people in Memphis, Tennessee. I especially liked the first one, which has two Japanese tourists there to visit Sun Records and Graceland. The second segment I liked less, which involves an Italian widow and a motormouth American she runs into. The third I liked slightly better than the second, and slightly less than the first. It involves three guys (one of them being Steve Buscemi), one of whom has a loaded gun and is drunk (who is not Steve Buscemi). All three stories meet up at a flophouse run by Screamin' Jay Hawkins (famous for recording the song You Put a Spell on Me) and a goofy little bellboy played by Spike Lee's brother, Cinqué. I really liked those two. The whole film is mysterious and charming, with a bit of magic in the air, but somehow, for me at least, it didn't result in too much.

In typical Jarmush style, this film is composed of mindless dialog amongst flat characters that just goes on ad nauseum. When the characters' words actually lead to actions, those actions are barely able to keep an already struggling plot alive. What saves this film from utter ruin are some amusing one-liners that satirize life in the Southern United States and the naivité of overseas tourists when they end up somewhere like Memphis. Hence the 3-star rating instead of a 1-star rating. Nevertheless, I think the film as a whole fails to entertain or to make any interesting observations on life in general.

Telling a trio of separate short stories serially, all connected in time and space, taking place during one day and one night in Memphis, this little indie has precious little story to tell and squeaks by with kookie, off-beat, peculiar, or unusual characters.  Obviously a low budget flick judging from the absence of what we go to movies to see (stars, stunts, action, great locations, etc.), Mystery Train is not a mystery but a dramady with very little comedy or drama leaving only a void full of good intentions. For indie lovers only.  (C+) "}]
