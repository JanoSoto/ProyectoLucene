However, I was pleasantly surprised, and reassured that my distrust of what the newspaper reviewers think is not misplaced.This movie has a cast that includes the supremely talented Robert de Niro, Kelsey Grammar, and Edward Burns. It has some excellent writing and some top-notch acting performances. But its real accomplishment is how it makes you think.The increasing relationship between crime and the media is not linear, and the movie does tend to oversimplify at times. In many respects, it suffers horribly from being predictable, although there were instances where it strayed sharply from the rules of formulaic movies. (Saying any more on that score would give away important aspects of the plot, so I'll refrain from elaborating.) Furthermore, in true Hollywood tradition, the main villains are dumb, completely amoral, and oh, did I mention foreign? The idea might have been to give an outsider perspective on the abuse of American culture, but that angle ultimately just plays into outdated audience prejudices against people who speak with an Eastern European accent.Too, the movie has very graphic violence - but not as bad as I'd expected, and not as bad as what is shown in many other movies. Through creative camera angles, many of the bloodiest scenes are only obscurely hinted at, leaving the audience to fill in the pieces.Not surprisingly, many entertainment reviewers disliked the movie, because it has the effect of exposing some of the more negative effects of the media. 15 Minutes does not claim that the media causes violence; rather, it explains that the interplay between the two is ingrained in American culture. This movie may not be saying anything original, but it is sufficiently entertaining and thought-provoking to make it worth seeing.

Surprisingly it turned out to be an exciting and occasionally quite funny thriller about two media obsessed thugs from the former Soviet Union who decide to become celebrities by committing a series of murders and videotaping the crimes.  The movie is definitely not without serious flaws for instance, nobody ever points out that it's almost impossible to mount a successful insanity defense in the US legal system.  In a land where Jeffrey Dahmer and New York's highly delusional subway shooter are certified as sane these guys wouldn't have a shot in hell of making their case, and an insanity defence is the linchpin of their whole plan to profit from their crimes.  Movie also ignores the fact that laws have been on the books to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes by selling their stories since the 1960's.  Also, given the legal and ethical ramifications involved it's hard to imagine any credible scenario under which a news program, even a sleazy tabloid news program, would pay a million dollars cash to an at large murderer for a videotape of one of his crimes and then broadcast the thing live on television.  Obvious flaws aside, 15 Minutes has several shockingly well-staged action sequences, great acting (except for the guy who played Ed Burns' boss--his grating one note performance went way over the self-parody line) and occasional welcome touches of black humor, like the very funny death scene of the thug who fancied himself a film director and manufactures the final shot of his movie for maximum emotional impact.  All in all 15 Minutes is a dark and funny thriller and certainly a lot better than most of the schlock Hollywood churns out.

It is a thematic movie that makes a strong, supported, and convincing stand on many current controversial issues, targeting and exposing the many weaknesses and absurdities of the American legal systems. The film also incorporates prospects dealing with greed, power, popularity, the public eye, influences of media, the power of television, and the desire of immigrants to achieve fame in America. This is not your typical Hollywood action flick; it is occupied with twists and unconventional surprises in which many producers would stay far away. Fifteen Minutes is a movie with guts and impact, and for the first time in a long time, the theater audience where I screened the film gave it a recognizable applause as the closing credits appeared.	Fifteen Minutes is complete with big Hollywood names, like Robert De Niro, Edward Burns, Kelsey Grammer, and even includes cameos from several distinguishable actors Charlize Theron has a neat little appearance as a recruiter for hookers, and David Alan Grier shows up as a pedestrian causing trouble in New York City. But the movie actually centers on two Eastern European immigrants named Emil Slovak (Karel Roden), and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov). They have come to the United States looking for a man who owes them a large sum of money, but eventually discover opportunities for fame. They kill their debtors and capture the murders on a stolen home video camera. There is, of course, an illegal immigrant who witnessed the crime, Daphne (Vera Farmiga), who is now wary and on the run.	Enter homicide detective Eddie Flemming (De Niro), a local celebrity, and arson investigator Jordy Warsaw (Burns), who could not care less about the media. They form a team to undercover what appears to be a fatal fire accident, but soon discover the scene was the location of a brutal murder. Enter a subplot where a veteran detective informs a novice of the same sort new ways to explore his profession. The story then takes an unexpected turn of events where the criminal's intentions explode into sadistic atrocity Oleg and Emil plan to sell the video of their murders to a TV network anchor (Kelsey Grammer) for a million dollars. They intend to beat the charges with an insanity plea, also stating that they were abused as children. Why would the two immigrants want to do such a thing? To achieve fame-even if it is of a notorious nature. 	 We wait patiently for the story to take off with the setup, but it stays with two separate narratives for quite sometime. When the narratives do cross its obvious this is not your typical, run-of-the-mill action picture, but an insightful picture that says something about, among many other concepts, the power and influence of the media.  The madman fascinated with video taping is yesterday's news already seen in 1999's American Beauty. It does not have the same impact in this film, however, mostly because here it is more of a sadistic obsession never truly understood, rather than the passion and exploration in the multiple Academy Award winner. It is fun watching the incidences photographed with the home video camera; there are some cool special effects that add a nice touch to the scenes. Robert De Niro gives another suave hotshot performance; it is coming to the point where his talent is more effective in shtick comedies like Analyzed This. Regardless, the veteran actor grabs us by the collar and yanks with no regrets and a thought-provoking, determined attitude. The screenplay provides his character with an effective soft side through a romance with his girlfriend. Edward Burns (Saving Private Ryan) is never really bad in a movie, but his personality feels too resigned and modest to be in these violent dramas. He has a few understood moments, and often his performance fits his character accordingly, but a braver, more aggressive actor may have fit the part better.	Surprisingly, the best performances in Fifteen Minutes come from the villains, Oleg Taktarov and Karel Roden. Both are very clever in their roles, which are also exceedingly well written when the two encounter a visit with a local prostitute, the scene does not result in mechanical sex, but in violent misunderstanding that furthers the complications of the plot. Both actors are convincing and unpredictable. Many early critics have complained about the film's implausibility, but Taktarov and Roden portray their characters with such mean-spirited brutality and complex emotions, I believed every step they took. 	 John Herzfeld is the film's director. His last project, 2 Days in the Valley, was quite a bit different from Fifteen Minutes. There are certain aspects of his filmmaking style that carry over, but for the most part this film stands on its own from his previous achievements. Herzfeld constructs Fifteen Minutes with complexity and thought. It is a brave, courageous movie, deserving of controversy but will likely pass as a theme-orientated action picture. I think most audiences will appreciate the production for what it is and how it informs us on such distressing issues. When we walk out of the theater, we get a sense that we trust in our government's legal system even less than we did before watching the movie.

Wait! Come back! I was joking! This film is another flick that satirizes the media's influence in depicting real life crimes as sensationalistic newsgathering for the general public. We have seen this before in films such as `Natural Born Killers.' Critics have ridiculed `15 Minutes' because they say that the film actually demonstrates the same exact thing that it tries to satirize. It does this by showing gory murder -type violence and utilizing famous stars in small cameo roles. Even though I do have to agree with this concept that my colleagues (don't I wish) have criticized, I should say to them to `just wait one minute, or fifteen for that matter' and do not take it so seriously. Why? Because the film does entertain. I think that critics should just leave it at. By the way, the film is about a homicide detective and an arson investigator who hunt down some eastern european psychos who film their crimes on video. Robert Deniro, who plays the homicide detective, is more low key in this one; and Eddie Burns cinematic presence adds fuel to the fire as the arson investigator. I really do have to say that I enjoyed mostly every minute in `15 Minutes' even though most critics don't second my opinion.**** Good  "},{"Title":"One of the Best Commentaries I've Ever Seen","Date":"2 August 2004","Score":"24 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" This movie is a commentary.

I got the movie on DVD two days ago and I hardly couldn't wait to watch it, because I had already read quite a few comments, mostly negative one's, on it over the past few months. At first I was kind of disappointed. I was not the kind of movie I had expected. I was hoping to see a movie as great as `Heat' or `Ronin'. But one cannot compare these three movies. They are completely different. So I let my first impressions rest for a while and watched the movie the next day a second time. 15 Minutes is not as bad a movie after all. It has its good parts, though I would prefer some things to be different.The movie clearly shows how greedy and immoral the media can be if it comes to win ratings and get some money, even though it appears to be overdone in some parts. `Bad news is good news!' That is how it has always been and that is how it will always be, as long as there is an audience. Who would watch a news channel with only good news? People want sensation, even though they don't want to admit it. But there is certainly a limit to what the media should broadcast. In this movie the media exceeds this limit by far. Furthermore the film quite well points out the problem with the insanity plea. Some critics say the film glorifies violence, which is not right. The two bad guys in this movie are so ugly and their crimes are so heinous, one cannot but loathe their deeds. I also want to mention how well chosen the cast is. Robert DeNiro is, as always, brilliant is his role. His performance is definitely the highlight in this movie. The action scenes are very well done too.What I didn't like is the way the story goes in some parts. For example how the two criminals get access to Eddy's (Robert DeNiro) apartment. A famous detective just doesn't make a stupid mistake like this. Then the bad guy Oleg with the digital camcorder acts just way too silly, which lets him appear rather unrealistic to me. Even though he is meant to be crazy, his stupid behavior goes way too far. His character can not be taken seriously. Edward Burns as the arson investigator also has to act a little too unprofessional at times, which doesn't add anything positive to his character's credibility. All this gives the whole story an unrealistic touch from time to time, which is very sad. In general I don't like a movie to be cut down just to get it to an 2-hour length. Most of the time I prefer to have the deleted scenes put back in again, but this movie is really better off without them. The final scene has an interesting twist, but the coincidence with Nicolette is just too farfetched. Oleg's final appearance looks ridiculous and doesn't fit into the whole tragic, unless it were supposed to be a comedy.  It is a tense thriller, with some suspense, though only two scenes really kept me on the edge of my seat. I also missed scenes introducing some more the characters played by Robert DeNiro and Edward Burns.Nevertheless I rank it a 7 out of 10.

This one comes from a time when some people in America thought the gravest threat to this country was Fast Food Media ala A Current Affair. Anyway, two criminals &#150; one Czech and one Russian (the movie makes a big deal of distinguishing them, though it makes absolutely no difference in the plot), come to America to kill a partner of their's. They soon become immersed in the world of talk shows, and decide that the quickest route to fame and fortune is to kill somebody famous, plead insanity, go to the mental home, say they're not insane, then get out and write a best selling book and make a movie. Or something, it's not exceptionally clear &#150; although presumably that's the point. (Although the movie has to allow its criminals enough smarts to be able to plot deadly arson traps and track down witnesses in a foreign country, which is unbelievable in the extreme.) Their target is Robert De Niro, an improbably famous NYC cop who they see on the cover of People Movie suffers in part from having its bad guys way out-act the nominal protagonists, De Niro and Ed Burns, both of whom have the charisma here of dead fish in a dying pond. So much so that I spent a lot of the time hoping the bad guys would win. Movie also suffers from a truly terrible script. Characters spout clichés as a way to Illustrate the Point (If it bleeds it leads! Kelsey Grammar's character says, as though it had never been said before). Oddball situations arise for essentially no reason and the script has to do a ton of backfilling in order to explain them, such as why Ed Burns, a fire inspector, is basically De Niro's partner, or how a crazy Czech killer knows enough to rig an apartment to burn up. Characters scream at other characters about something or other, but it never seems to mean anything in the long run. Etc. (The script does deserve to be commended for one very neat plot twist halfway through, though.) And the movie's oddly repellent. It wants to preach to its audience about the dangers of mass media, but besides the general hypocrisy of having a movie, of all things, tell me this, there's a specific vibe here that glories in the same thing it's denouncing. There's a completely gratuitous murder of a prostitute here, for instance, that's excitingly shot and performed and seems to exist only to gin the ratings up to an R I'd rather not be lectured on morality by a movie that does that.In general, 15 MINUTES is a secret sharer in the very thing it denounces.

As a film, it has many flaws.  It's choppy, with many useless scenes (watch for the scene towards the end with Ed Burns and Emil in the warehouse-what's the point?).  It's characters are generally contrived and silly, but are brought to half-life only by the actors behind them. It is original in some spots (one in particular), but mostly runs on tired cliche.  The timing of the humor is very poor, and leads to a general feeling of awkward discomfort in the audience.  Everything about this film, right down to costumes and set decoration, is extremely ugly.  I don't know if that was intended, but it's just plain hard to look at.  The entire film was surrounded by that aura of ugliness- ugliness not only of the sets and costumes, but of the characters and story. And that story involves a cop named Eddie Flemming (Robert DeNiro), an inferior rehash of Kevin Spacey's Jack Vincennes in  L.A. Confidential. Eddie uses the media to make his job easier- and as a result, has become a minor celebrity.  Edward Burns plays Jordi Warsaw, a New York Fire Marshall who joins Eddie on the case to find two Eastern European criminals newly in the US to wreak havoc.  They have learned from watching television that no one in America is responsible for what they do- and that the media run the show.  Murderers become millionaires, and these two know it.  They begin to kill and videotape their killings.  They plan to kill somebody famous and sell it for millions of dollars.  Eddie and Jordi have to stop them.Now you might ask, why is a fireman on the case- The answer is that there is no answer.  They throw in a bit with fire just to bring the Jordi character into it.  All writers in Hollywood like to invent different jobs that allow people to be just like cops- without being cops.  I guess they figure it makes it more exciting because the cop thing has been done so much.  They're wrong.  Making the character a fireman is a distraction, leaving the audience wondering what he's doing there. There is no justification for his presence at the crime scenes.  Just making him DeNiro's character would have allowed the film to run much smoother.  There are lots of scenes, character developments, and even romances in this film that serve absolutely no purpose.  Writer/Director Herzfeld was filling gaps where they didn't need to be filled.  It shows that he was looking for something to do, that he only really had one idea, and was strained to make a two hour film out of it. I mentioned the film's ugliness- It just leaves you with a sick feeling in your stomach.  This isn't a sign that the material was effective, just horrible.  In a way, the movie  is mean spirited, and that is never a good thing.  The way the humor was added showed absolutely no skill on the part of the filmmaker.  He should have watched his own movie before releasing it, because if he did, he would know how awkward that humour is.So it all sounds pretty bad, I know.  The film's only high points come from generally good performances (DeNiro never fails, even if the script does) and a single point of originality.  The film's message, regarding the injustice of the American system, and its preoccupation with fame, publicity, image and the media that creates it all, are points well taken, but not properly executed. The first hour of the movie is deeply unentertaining and choppy, but the second half, at least, becomes somewhat suspenseful and little bit interesting. Overall, 15 Minutes should be avoided.

Arguably, the first shot freed a hostage, and, if you think the villain needed to die, then the second shot achieved something, too, in killing him; but the remaining four shots were pure bloodlust.  There was little to justify even the first shot.  The hero was no longer a policeman, but a private citizen taking the law into his own hands; moreover, the villain had already been decisively defeated (you have to pay attention to notice this, since by the final scene the director has long since forgotten what his film was supposed to be about).  What's particularly disgusting is the way this scene is presented.  We see law enforcement officials smiling to themselves as the hero - now a criminal himself - walks away from the scene of the shooting.  Nobody stops him.  Our hero, we're meant to think, having become a gunslinger, is now a MAN.  Wrong.

Also it decries violence but shoves scenes of extreme blood and violence in our face--one sadistic sequences shows a topless hooker being beaten and stabbed the death. Also we get more than a few shots of her nude, bloody body afterwords. Yet, if you ignore the loopholes (and there are many) in the plot and brace yourself for the violence, the film works. It's virtually nonstop action, violence, noise going at you full blast. The acting--well, who cares? This movie is not an acting movie. DeNiro walks through his role as a celebrity cop and Edward Burns looks very handsome but utterly miserable all through the film. Also the two psychos tend to overdo it too much.

It deals with the media's fixation on lurid, disgusting human beings and the violent acts they commit, glorifying such spectacle and pouring salt in the wound simply for rating. Robert Deniro plays NY detective Eddie Flemming, a burnt out hero cop who stages busts so the press can see him in action and get the scoop. When two demented, psychopathic eastern European guys come to town to collect an old debt, they go on an impulsive crime spree and discover that by filming their crimes and peddling the footage to a sleazeball news network they can gain money, and notoriety. Fleming and a rookie arson investigator (Ed Burns) are soon on their trail as their rampage reaches feverish heights of heinous villainy. Karel Roden, an astoundingly good Czech actor, gives the best work of the film as the lead nut job, giving us a grinning, cunning, joker esque portrait of evil. MMA fighter Oleg Taktarov is deadpan good as his child like, brutish companion. Kelsey Grammar plays the amoral, smutty news anchor expertly, and there's great work from David Alan Grier, Melinda Kanakaredes, Vera Farmiga, and a nice cameo from Charlize Theron. The film knows it has to be unpleasant to get its point across, and has fun with the twitchy, almost Tony Scott like excess of style. The heart of the film rests with Roden and Taktarov though, follow in them almost like protagonists and letting them do their thing, like a nightmare, Slavic version of Laurel and Hardy. It's a deliciously twisted little flick with some cool ideas, a great cast and a cheerfully trashy style.

The society watches and enjoys television; through it they see all that matters, and only what can be known by TV is worth knowing... even police officers are caught in this American mania, having TV shows, fighting between each other in order to have a 15 minutes breakout. Also the western Europe killers... who come to America and first get a camera (obviously by stealing it, since they are immigrants)...The idea seems to be at least not bad, but the script is too obvious, half of the movie the word Television is pronounced. The motif that makes the two Europeans kill is not shown, but those stupid dialogs like more illumination to the scene or cut and rolling are said a hundred times, making the film obvious, predictable, and hence, boring.The movie, is in my opinion, racist. The whole story is about two European guys that will kill anyone for no reason, these killers are really lame because they let everyone to see their faces through the videos, their fingerprints and so much more. But the police officers have too much trouble capturing them (so they are even more stupid I guess?). How can someone be so unreachable in the mass-media era? That's the major failure of the story.And the movie itself is boring, Robert De Niro, an experienced actor, is just doll. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning, but the Melina Kanakaredes' character.Too bad that an interesting story like the idea of snuff in our media (perhaps a reality nowadays) is wasted in such a terrible film.

So, the movie 15 Minutes plays off of this idea. It portrays a Russian and a Czech coming to New York to deal with a man who owes them money, but then find something even better they murder people and videotape their delicts. Needless to say, the media is only too happy to make hay of it.Now for the movie's aspect that I didn't like. I am getting a little tired of movies making Russians (and in this case, also Czechs) the bad guys. I know that geopolitics was dominated for over forty years by the Cold War, but aren't we through portraying Slavic people as villains? I spent autumn, 2005, in St. Petersburg, where I lived with a local family (and I enjoyed it there very much); I then spent autumn, 2006, in Yekaterinburg, where I lived with a local family (I enjoyed it there very much).

Therefore, my review will focus on the most perfect casting job that I have ever seen. From the beginning, the murderer has counted on getting away with his crimes because he has studied the American jurisprudence system and knows that he can make himself appear to be insane and, therefore, not responsible for his actions. To this end he hires Cutler to be his defense attorney. To those of you who may not be familiar with Cutler, in real life he is indeed a top defense attorney who has become a millionaire by successfully defending criminals like John Gotti. On too many occasions I have seen Cutler look straight into the TV cameras at pre and post trial press conferences and tell everyone how the authorities are trying to railroad his client and that his client was totally innocent of any and all charges. Of course, on those occasions, Cutler was a liar and everyone knew it. But, he knows how to perfectly play the system for all that it's worth and usually emerges victorious. In this movie he tries the same tactics on the jury. When you watch the film you will see the results for yourself. One thing's for certain. Cutler did not have to memorize any lines to play this part. He simply acted the same way that he does in real life, ie, cutting under the table deals with the defendant, etc. With Gotti spending the rest of his life in jail, I guess that Cutler wants a new and different source of income. Hollywood would do well to call him anytime they need someone to play a sleazy attorney.

It is great commentary on some of the more discussed flaws of the American Justice system as well as a very critical look at the power of sensational media in the United States. The movie deals with these issues in a very graphic light, which is honestly refreshing, rather than tiptoeing around them in a court room scene.  With that however comes some very violent scenes which may be difficult for some people to handle.  Even with the very graphic nature of the violence I felt like it had a place in the film.  It wasn't unnecessary and truly helped make the point and to bring about feelings of absolute disgust directed at two of the main characters.  Which brings me to another great aspect of this film. You aren't left feeling apathetic towards any character. You either felt a great sense of understanding for the motives behind their actions, or you abhor them by the end of the film. I don't see Fifteen Minutes as a film that will leave its viewers indifferent.

Writer/Director John Herzfeld, whose last movie was the wonderfully witty 2 Days in the Valley crafts a rare kind of movie experience in a genre where you'd least expect it. The film follows two foreigners named Emil (Karl Roden) and Razgul (Oleg Taktarov). They have come to America for different reasons. Emil is intending to catch up with a former prison mate who promised him a share of money, and Razgul, a lover of cinema, wants to make movies. Razgul is so much of film lover, that he soon steals a home movie camera from a store, and begins filming his tour of New York. Emil's partner has denied him his money, and Emil acting on pure vengeance, brutally kills him and his girlfriend, all of which Razgul joyfully captures on film. They also set fire to the couple's apartment.

Investigating for the fire marshall's office is Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns), who doesn't care much for Eddie Fleming's flame, or for media news in general.Fifteen Minutes doesn't bore for a second, and it is constantly burning with tension right to the very end of the film, and there is much humor in the movie, too. I admired the romantic subplot between De Niro's character and a news reporter, played by Melina Kanakaredes from the television show Providence. Who would ever thought that a cop and a news reporter could have a fling? The movie's action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a long, long while, including a foot pursuit of the two killers in traffic-crazed NYC, and a truly remarkable sequence involving Burns' character and a witness escaping a exploding apartment building, which I think ranks as one of the greatest fire escaping scenes ever, if there is such a category, hehe. The movie's climax is especially satisfying, which is surprsing to find in a film that is mostly dark and hard-edged as this one.Fifteen Minutes boasts some killer performances as well. De Niro is at his usual greatness, but the film really belongs to Edwards Burns, who actually has more screen time, and if this film is a hit, it will definately make a star out of him. Burns is already an accomplished writer/director, but his only breakthrough acting was in Saving Private Ryan, and he hasn't done a film since then. Kelsey Grammer is another actor who hasn't made many films in a while, mainly because of his continuous success on television's Frasier, and he is very convincing as a basket case of a news reporter. Then there's Karl Roden as the savagely demented Emil. Roden has a amazingly creepy presence in this movie, and he can scare you by just narrowing his eyes and cracking a hideous girn. The movie also has cameos from David Alan Grier, Kim Cattrall, and Charlize Theron.Fifteen Minutes is the best movie of this year so far, and for me, will end up as one of the ten best films of 2001. A brilliantly hard-edged thriller with some biting social commentary on news, murder, and the corrupt justice system which is most of the times capable of making nightmares really happen.

Even in failure, they raise the bar. This film aims high and fails. What this film has is a very clever self-referential notion another film about films, but one that directly indicts its own audience. It also has two excellent bad guys. These guys really move like East Europeans (like Liam in 'Schindler'), which starts out with a set of movements that is rare in film, and adds an unusual logic with a visual metaphor. Plus we have deNiro in a role that is more apt than any of his recent ones. He plays someone who lives to be seen by a camera. (He practices his proposal as if it were to be filmed -- shades of Taxi Driver -- plus his intended is reporter!) He uses a different set of moves than the visitors, and which are natural to the man, and are already common enough to be self-parodied. But watching an actor act like an actor is a treat, especially when we have two guys who turn into actors and a slew of TeeVee people who are in front of cameras, but who don't know the moves. Then deNiro gets killed. That's novel. Theron has a powerful few minutes. Farmiga is lovely, playing much the same as her Autumn role.With this alone, Soderburgh could have done really well. This could be the sort of stuff that would make up for Ritchie's fluff problem. But in Herzfeld's hands, it turns to goo, because he lards it up with so many formulaic devices.The primary problem is the Burns character, Warsaw. Everything about him is tired. This is a fellow that avoids the camera, avoids people, acts as the center of intelligence, the detective, the spine of the film. But he actually plays none of these things, just an automatic device, played by a rank mugger. This problem of stereotype is compounded by the introduction of the anchor and lawyer. Its the easiest thing in the world to poke fun at these smarmy types. But what we have here are cardboard.This formulaic machinery progressively drags things into the mediocre until the banal ending, with the hero walking away having tasted his revenge. Oh why do writers not give endings the attention they deserve? Why does Hollywood force such drek, always on the end?

He courts the press to shadow him at times and he views his minor fame as helpful to his job solving crimes. Nevertheless, his near constant media exposure is disturbing. Meanwhile, a top fire investigator, Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) prefers a low profile as he solves important arson cases. One fateful day, two immigrants, Oleg and Emil from Eastern Europe arrive at JFK. Although the one tells the airport's immigration officer that he came to make movies like Frank Capra, that is not their main reason for their journey. They are criminals, newly released from prison, and are tracking down a former partner who made off with their part of the dough. All too soon, they find him and his wife in an old Lower East Side apartment building. The money has been spent on establishing a plumbing business. Oleg, the more out of control perp, brutally murders both of them, while Emil films it with a stolen camera. After the crime, they set the building on fire. This brings in both Eddie and Jordy, whose work habits clash. Yet, they soon join forces to stop the two evil ones and protect a witness, Daphne (Vera Farmiga) who saw the murder from her apartment doorway across the hall. All the while, a sleazy television show producer (Kelsey Grammar) wants to get the whole case on his second rate program, Top Story. How many folks will lose their lives before Oleg and Emil can be stopped? This VERY VIOLENT film has an intriguing story. There is indeed a fine line between a crime and excessive media coverage of a crime. More murders probably do get solved if the public is aware of its happening. Also, Burns is a most attractive, talented performer while De Niro can handle any role, anytime with great skill. With Farmiga, Charlize Theron, Grammar, Melina Kanakeredes and others on board, the cast is wonderful. But, a STRONG CAUTION to potential viewers. The violence in this film is horrific, when it happens, and there was truly no need for its excessive nature. Sometimes, its mitigated by special features the criminals' video camera has to distort the picture. But, not always. If there was not a great cast and a strong story line to consider, I would definitely not encourage ANYONE to view it. As it is, watch at your own discretion and use the fast forward button a lot.

On the flip side, the social commentary is over-simplified and disappears for long stretches of the movie while the thriller unfolds so much so that any commentary seems like an after-thought (despite its primary reference in the title).I do think that Mr. DeNiro gave one of his better performances in recent years and I was surprised that he signed on for this role. Perhaps the movie changed during shooting or in post-production. I appreciate Mr. Norton's attempt to stretch behind his normal role as the likable guy but I am not sure that he was a good casting choice here. The casting of the 2 major criminals, however, was spot on.The subplots - for example, excessive drinking by Mr. DeNiro's character, a pending wedding proposal, a shift in a TV show's management and content, internal politics in the NYPD and NYFD - add nothing to either the crime thriller or the social commentary agenda.

Didn't Andy Warhol declare that everyone will be famous for 15 minutes? At least he was supposed to say it, and folks do chase that elusive star status. So it is that two amoral Eastern Europeans, weaned on dumb tabloid TV shows exported to Europe, come to America thinking that the US is a land of opportunity for folks like them. In their deranged minds, they believe that no one is responsible for what they do. The psychos assume that all they have to do is commit crimes, get them on tape, get captured, declare insanity, and rake in the dough that comes in through TV appearances and book rights. Simple enough . . .The two immigrants are criminals from Eastern Europe. The dominant one is as vile as one can imagine, a frightening Czech with contorted features and bulging eyes (Karel Roden = Emil Slovak). Slovak? Hmmm, why not Slovakian instead of Czech? Anyway, he is a psychotic murderer who enjoys his work. The other, Oleg Taktarov (Oleg Razgul) is a none-too bright Russian who constantly and annoyingly takes videos of everything around him with his camcorder, which he stole in Times Square. They go to a NY apartment of a plumber friend to get their share of the loot that the friend and his wife were holding for them while the two depraved ones did serious jail time in the old country. Of course the money has been spent. Of course the couple will not survive. The murderers get it all on tape. But it does not help that a jittery redhead Czech woman, Daphne Handlova (Vera Varmiga), witnessed the whole thing and barely escapes on the fire escape into the city streets below. The psychopaths set fire to the place. On the crime scene is NY homicide detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro). Flemming provides seedy Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammar), a Jerry Springer-like reality TV host (Top Story), information about his arrests to provide the show with the stories and eventual top ratings. Eddie's reward is publicity and folk-hero status. But it should be understood that in this film Eddie is not compromised by the relationship He is a good and competent officer. His girl is attractive Nicolette Karas (Melina Kanakaredes). Hey, I'm glad they kept her a Greek in the flick. She has the essence and looks it. Nicolette is the lead crime reporter for Top Stories, and we can ascertain how the two lovers help each others' careers along. Also on the crime scene is arson investigator Fire Marshal Jordy Warsaw (as Polish as one can get, Edward Burns), who has a partner, fireman Camello (Mike Camello, whose role is small). The Deputy Fire Marshal's name is Duffy. And there's Eddie's partner, a detective named Jackson. Notice all these ethnic surnames? Well, it is New York after all! Anyway, after an initial minor confrontation Flemming and Warsaw decide to work together as they realize that the arson masked a double murder. Remember, the killers are not yet ready to surrender. Now as terrified Daphne is an illegal immigrant she is afraid to come to the police for obvious reasons. And the thuggish ones have this knowledge, and they know her identity. They track her down to her place of work as a hair washer in a woman's beauty saloon. Daphne is threatened not to say anything, or else. Before that the two sociopaths murdered a prostitute who told them about Daphne's situation. After leaving the salon they are spotted on the streets by Flemming and Warsaw, who give chase. Emil and Oleg escape into vast Central Park, although the former takes a bullet in the foot.Daphne does cooperate with the police, and there are more taped murders, especially one in a surprising pivotal scene in the second half. The creeps want to sell the tapes to Hawkins for one million dollars. So the two lunatics hire themselves a lawyer as sleazy as they can get (Bruce Cutler). Cutler plans on pleading insanity for them by blaming the crimes on Emil's supposed abusive childhood. Oleg will be sent to a mental institution, where he will miraculously recover, be declared sane, and be released. The maniacs will then cash in on their celebrity status, like a movie deal, knowing that they cannot be tried again because of double jeopardy. If the plan appears preposterous, well it is. Then the amateur director and the filmmaker quarrel, setting up the denouement.There are stretches here. I wondered long and hard about the possibility of a policeman and fireman teaming up for an obvious criminal investigation. And the conclusion surely has many coincidences. And before that the criminals' dream sort of comes true, doesn't it? Nevertheless, the movie does create tension, especially near the end. By then we are convinced that anything can happen in a movie that says that the media inculcates violence. But the film's cynical opinion is just as oppressive and brutal as the tabloid TV show it was supposedly against. Then again, maybe it's just a satire! One thing's for sure &#x96; subtle it isn't!Robert De Niro, a fine and respected actor who has won two Academy Awards for Best Actor (The Godfather Pt. II, 1974 and Raging Bull, 1980), does very well with the role of a smart and eccentric NY detective. He shows signs of warmth, as when he takes time to write notes and practice proposing to his attractive girlfriend. Burns, rather bland (intentional?), is the opposite. Kanakaredes looks good and is competent as usual. Grammar, also a capable actor, does well with his part as a slimy TV host. But the best parts are those of the two unpredictable criminals themselves, who occupy much screen time. Karel Roden is just repellent. Would anyone want to be in the same room with this guy?

I love it when de Niro plays a character you can trust, an ordinary but heroic man who does not have a psychopathic sting in the tail.

Who's the main character? Bad guys, good guys? Firemen? Police? It has split your attention 3 ways and it's not easy to enjoy from that mistake. Also, the film is supposed to be funny sometimes, and you think Deniro has a new sidekick. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is it a cop movie? Or a news movie? Then before you know it, the character they spent the whole movie teaching you aboutwith details about his love life, his crime scene investigation, his history with the media, is dead. Not a good way to go 3/4 of a way through. If Titanic had detailed the lives of 5 characters on board the ship, killed of Jack before the boat went down, made the ice berg a character, and gone in so many directions it would have been a flop too. The producers new they had a flop on their hands, and they tried to fix it by releasing it late. Woops....did not work.

Here are the main things, lest I begin to ramble1. Ethnocentric World View - This is supposed to be an indictment of American media? Message movies that play to cultural stereotypes drive me crazy. These two Eastern European thugs come to America, watch a show about forgiveness, and decide that they're going to teach America a lesson by embarking on a murderous rampage? If this was made a few years later it would have been two Muslim men instead of Russian. This is terrible, mainly because the writer is trying to present these lofty ideas about humanity and the immorality of American media, all the time while playing to cultural stereotypes that do nothing but reinforce racism. The low-brow stereotypes don't stop there either, David Alan Grier has a cute part where he is an angry black guy in the park who tried to rob the wrong guy. His relevance to the plot? Nothing but to add a little touch of humor ... seriously? 2. Hypocrisy - This film was distributed by New Line Home Video, an 'indie' subsidiary of Warner Bros. Super progressive Warner Bros. who are major players in the empire 15 Minutes is coming out against. Why would Warner Bros, or New Line, put out a movie that could incite a revolution and cause millions of people to reevaluate the way they watch media? Well, Bobby De Niro's in it, so you know it's good for at least breaking even ... plus the movie is no good, so no one will really talk about it.The real crime, however, and the major reason I believe it didn't work, it that it is just so incredibly smug. There are other 'message' movies that exist that all fall into the same pitfalls as I discussed above, but 15 Minutes is so smug and pretentious about it's message that it falls flat.Rating 16/40 "},{"Title":"15 Minutes Whose Counting ***","Date":"6 March 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Robert DeNiro getting killed with some time before the movie ends?

"},{"Title":"Not what it appears to be","Date":"2 March 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" The hook that New Line Cinema is using to draw people into 15 Minutes is that people are addicted to sensationalistic violence, and as one character puts it, If it bleeds, it leads. The draw here is that there are two psychopaths who are using this known fact to bring themselves fame by documenting the gruesome murders that they commit and selling them to the media. While this is true, the social satire of the film is really only visible during the beginning and at the end. The bulk of the film is a standard order police procedural, but it's still engaging.Two immigrants, Emil (Karel Roden) and Oleg (Oleg Taktarov) have come to the United States to collect their share of a bank robbery they committed. When their cohort had spent their share of the loot, Emil kills him and the guy's girlfriend, while Oleg captures it on the camera he just stole. It doesn't take long before they realize the potential of filming their violent crimes. Hot on their trail are an alcoholic cop named Eddie Fleming (Robert DeNiro), who is the famed pet of tabloid guru Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammar, and arson investigator Jody Warsaw (Edward Burns).The film is a mixed bag. There are some good things about this film, and there are some that are awful. I'll give it credit for taking some chances and going in unexpected directions, but it also has some moments of jaw-dropping stupidity. And while there's some genuine tension in the film and the premise is interesting, I felt a little let down. Not only isn't the social satire original, it's not even effectively wedded into the main story. Also, I felt betrayed by the advertising of this film; I was expecting a cat-and-mouse type thriller between the cops and the criminals, and the media who is exploiting it. However, seeing as writer/director John Herzfeld wasn't trying to go for this angle (at least I hope not...), I can't really blame the film for this, just the studio.The acting is adequate. Eddie is a role that Robert DeNiro could do in his sleep. It doesn't require to stretch his range, but then again, DeNiro is still highly enjoyable to watch when he's not really trying, so it doesn't matter. Edward Burns seems a little out of his element, but his performance isn't a complete bust. The villains are the stars of the show. If you want a frighteningly psychopathic Russian villain, they don't come any better than Karl Roden. Emil is one nasty piece of work whose logic to his plan is frighteningly plausible. His counterpart, Oleg Takratov, isn't as smart and too starry-eyed by fame to be as dangerous as Emil, but he's not everything he seems to be. The part of Richard Hawkins deserves to be played in an over-the-top manner (is there any other way to play a Jerry Springer/Geraldo Rivera clone?), but Grammar doesn't go far enough to be truly vile, though I liked the fact that he gave Hawkins a small dose of humanity (whethere it was genuine or not is up for debate). Small parts by Melina Kanakaredes (who is wasted as Eddie's girlfriend), Vera Farmiga, and Charlize Theron (in a blink and you'll miss it appearance) are great.This isn't an especially bad film, but I don't know if there's enough good stuff to outweigh the bad.

However, there's definitely more of worth to be found here; this has a moral, even if it isn't necessarily the most subtle presentation of such a thing, ever. It's also has plenty of tension... I was on the edge of my seat for an awful lot of it(and I wasn't exactly bored, the rest of the time). The plot is very good and develops nicely throughout. The humor is reasonable, and this can be pretty entertaining. The acting is mostly spot-on. Direction and editing are remarkably effective, and the latter incredibly tight. Cinematography is great.

Starring Robert De Niro and Edward Burns, 15 Minutes take on an extreme look at reality media, where rival stations would chance upon to scoop one another at short notice, for ratings, fame and what have yous, even at the expense of morality. There's an upcoming movie called Untraceable which deals on the voyeuristic nature of modern audiences, but since this is a 2001 movie, exploitative media haven't got from bad to worse, yet, or so I believe.De Niro stars as a top celebrity cop Detective Eddie Flemming, who knows how to milk the media to the force's advantage. Being in the limelight also helps in investigations and cracking cases, because everyone wants an autograph, or to shake hands with someone famous. So it definitely helps in opening doors and breaking down hostilities. And his unofficial partner in this caper is Fire Marshal Jordy Warsaw, played by Edward Burns, whose character is an intriguing one, in that his profession is under the fire department, but has powers belonging to cops as his role is mainly an investigative piece into how fires are started, and if arson is suspected.Together, they form a somewhat mentor-rookie relationship, as Eddie teaches Jordy the 101 on homicide, as they sieve through clues of an incident where a couple is found dead in an apartment, but signs point to murder rather than accidental death by fire. And for the first half of the movie, this partnership actually starts to take their roots into tried and test buddy cop (well, technically not quite) movies, where differences are played to strengths, culminating in an exciting (I realize I seldom use this word nowadays) chase down the streets of New York, ala Heat, but minus the major firepower.But the movie takes a drastic turn in the second half, as gone are the action or potential action set up, and in comes the dwelling upon issues on everyone's 15 minutes of fame, as mentioned by Andy Warhol. Sometimes you do wonder, through reports, news, basically the media, how criminals can find it so easy to become a celebrity, making those obscene amount of cash through the writing of books or the selling of movie rights. And basically, it boils down to how we as consumers, fuel this kind of supply with demand from our curiosity. And it sure isn't alien too, where the crookedness of lawyers also assist in heaps on the perversion of law, for a cut of the profits, with their tools of the trade such as defense on the plea of insanity, and the double jeopardy clause. But why stop at lawyers when we can also target studio executives and talk show producers, whose exploitative shows feed on the sensational to sell their programme and to generate high ratings. Kelsey Grammar of Frasier fame, plays one such host, whom you'll just love to hate. Look out too for Charlize Theron in a cameo scene, with a brunette bob hairdo.Interesting concepts explored and examined, with relatively interesting villains as well (one of them an aspiring filmmaker!) make 15 Minutes a little more than an ordinary cop thriller. There's a key scene which I can't describe without spoiling it, but suffice to say it does bring out every ounce on tension there is to it, and such moments though were marred slightly by the ending which had a somewhat unnecessary cheesy moment. Still, this will go into my list of recommended movies, especially one that dwells on media issues.

The action scenes, when they come, are neither exciting nor involving. And to me, the film just falls apart after a particular event occurs at about 115 (this event may also make some viewers feel cheated). Give the film credit for not holding back in an era where many other films feel watered-down before they even reach the MPAA, but for me the only stand-out in this film is a brief and bizarre (but very clever) Rocky IV parody.

Jordy Warsaw was a blue-collar man and nothing more. As a hard working Fire Marshal he never even thought he'd see the brightness of any kind of limelight. Then there is Eddie Flemming; Eddie is a highly decorated police officer that has seen more than his share of big busts and big interviews. Eddie, however, doesn't mind the fame at all, as a matter of fact he likes it. Eddie isn't alone. A couple of crazed Russian killers also like fame, and with all the violence they see on American television and read about in American newspapers, becoming a star is as easy as filming the murder. During their killing spree, the two set an apartment ablaze, bringing Jordy in on the case. Yet before the fire, a murder occurred, which means Eddie must head to the scene and take it over. Although the two differ in ethics and viewpoints, they decide to team up to stop these two men before they can kill anyone else. 15 Minutes teams veteran actor Robert Deniro, in his first intense screen role since Ronin, with Edward Burns of Saving Private Ryan fame, whose star power continues to grow with every film he releases. Deniro is more than comfortable in his role as street smart Detective Flemming, and Burns is top-notch as the naive and straight-laced fire marshal whose eyes are opened to the media frenzy surrounding everyday violence, and its ability to award bad men celebrity status. The film also brings to the table a fantastic group of supporting players, including the hilarious Kelsey Grammer of Frasier, as the ratings hungry television anchor Robert Hawkins, as well as fine Russian newcomers Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov, as Flemming and Warsaw's fame-crazed adversaries. John Herzfeld does a notable job of creating this otherwise standard buddy cop film with Natural Born Killers undertones, into something with enough pace and grit to make you want to stay in your seat for two hours. He also lets his stars do what they do best, carry the film when it begins to get a bit to heavy. I use the word heavy meaning boring and unoriginal, which is noticeably abundant in Herzfeld's script, as he also wrote the film. Without his ability to direct better than he can write, and having the luck of getting quality actors to fill the roles in his film, Herzfeld's 15 minutes would have lasted just that at the box office, as nothing more than Colors meets Natural Born Killers, without either movies edge. Alas, I must admit the film is by no means poorly written, and it does take a couple of unexpected turns; it just seems that the films originality is seriously lacking. I can't really blame Herzfeld though, as all too many Hollywood releases as of late are seriously lacking in set department. In a nutshell, this is a modest film with modest production, nothing more, nothing less. So if you plan on spending your time watching a film and are a fan of either Deniro or Burns, and especially if you enjoy the mismatched partner style cop film, then I would say to you that it would be worth shelling 2 hours of your day to sit down and watch 15 Minutes.Overall Rating 7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"The media rules the society","Date":"9 April 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I cant understand why this movie get so low rate.

It wants to be a hard-hitting, cynical movie that skewers our celebrity-obsessed culture.   It doesn't quite live up to these aspirations but is a very successful movie otherwise.15 Minutes revolves around Detective Eddie Fleming, played with warmth and grit by Robert DeNiro.  Fleming is a good cop and a charismatic and masterful manipulator of the local media.  He's a regular on a tabloid television news show and somehow gets his picture on the cover of People Magazine.  Fleming's attitude towards fame seems healthy enough. He uses the adulation to make his job easier while playing the media like a violin. He lets the press know they need him more than he needs them.Fleming soon finds himself on the trail of two eastern European crooks, played by genuine eastern Europeans Karel Roden and Oleg Razgul. These two are sadistic clowns. Emil, who passes as the brains of the outfit, finds his hunt for an easy buck constantly undermined by his extremely short and very violent temper. Oleg is a movie mad Frank Capra fan who videotapes the duo's various crimes. In the normal course of things, habitual videotaping of one's illegal rampages would seem like a bad idea. Emil, however, is inspired to use Oleg's tapes to get them off the hook and - incidentally - make a cool million or two.In the course of his hunt for Emil and Oleg, Fleming is teamed with a fire marshal named Jordy Warsaw, played by Ed Burns.  Warsaw doesn't watch TV, has nothing but contempt for the media and has little interest in manipulating it.  When Fleming and Warsaw meet it looks like their contrasting attitudes towards the press are going to be entertainingly examined. Instead we get the same stale critique of the media that we have seen in scores of other movies. You know how it goes, people will do anything for their fifteen minutes of fame and this obsession is inherently evil, yadda-yadda.The screen time devoted to 15 Minutes' message mark the movie's weakest moments and poor Warsaw, as the scriptwriter's mouthpiece, is saddled with most of the lame passages. Fortunately Burns is thrown some interesting material in that Warsaw continuously makes decisions that are unprofessional at best and downright dangerous at worse.  When called on the carpet for his failings, rather than take some responsibility he blames the media for misinterpreting his actions.

I have no idea whether or not the film's ending was what the writer/director intended all along, but as with Training Day, it seems to go so far in the other direction from the rest of the film that it drags what was an unusual, gritty, and genuinely surprising work down to the level of typical Hollywood revenge fantasy.Stylishly staged with clever scene transitions and a very strong central performance by DeNiro, and featuring a truly shocking (even to these jaded eyes) plot twist, 15 Minutes had a chance to be something special. Instead, it tosses aside any hopes it had of making a unique statement in favor of a cheap thumbs up to vigilante justice.  Whether or not this total cop-out was forced on the director, one thing is for sure the studio did not know how to sell this film, aiming it at the adventure/thriller crowd with a typically hysterical and violent campaign.Another, more ironic ending would have been welcome, perhaps commenting on the corrupting influence of the whole experience on Burns' character, or dealing more squarely with Grammer's.

In the first fifteen minutes, as Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns (I))'s car breaks down, he runs through Central Park at night.  Right away, you think `Central Park at night means mugging' and sure enough, a convenient African American mugger pops up.  Then there we are thrown into the turf war between homicide and arson investigators.  Naturally there is a supervising officer who screams a lot.  And someone gets suspended.  (Someone always gets suspended in cop movies even though this isn't quite a cop movie.)  Then we have the `Broadcast News' angle.  Yes, not only are we subject to `good cop/bad cop', we have to sit through good reporter (who conveniently turns out to be Eddie Fleming (Robert De Niro)'s girl friend) and bad reporter Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer).  Grammer's character is a tabloid television journalist who makes Geraldo look like someone with ethics.  Though this movie spends too much time trying to be something for everyone, and in spite of the fact that we never really attach to or believe in any of the people in this movie, it is by far not the worst movie your could watch.

It is as if instead of a fine point pen the director used a very thick marker to draw his characters - with the result being that all the details are blurred and not visible, the villains are too evil, the violent scenes are too extreme, and the good guys are almost corny (except maybe for Eddie Fleming (a great - as always - Robert De Niro), who does not have a chance to get corny because he dies halfway through the movie). Plus, it exaggerates the hunger for sensational in the media - it takes it way over the top, although I have a feeling that at least the first instinct of many a TV producer in the today media would be to do exactly what Kelsey Grammer's character did in this movie, just for higher ratings and an extra minute of fame.

After I found out that this great 'method'-actor was going to play the role of the cool cop in an action-picture, I was convinced that this particular movie was going to be well worth-watching.  How wrong I was!                    *****SPOILER*****15 minutes isn't a bad movie, but it's so disorganized that it ruins the whole picture.  Actually, it consists of two parts. The first part WITH Robert De Niro is good.  You have two criminals who learn how the American media circus can make a remorseless killer look like the victim and make them rich.  On the other side, you'll find the good guys.  There's De Niro's character; a cool homicide detective who's eventually assisted by a fire marshall; played by Edward Burns.  Despite some poor acting, I really loved this 'cat-and-mouse-game' between the good guys and the bad guys.  But halfway the movie, director John Herzfeld makes an awful decision that will ruin the entire picture.  Totally without any warning whatsoever Robert De Niro's character is killed!Therefore the second part WITHOUT Robert De Niro is boring.  I don't mind the killing of an interesting character played by a famous actor (e.g. Sean Connery's character in The untouchables), but the way it was done here is simply too disturbing.  It's like taking the wheels from under a car.  Everything seems to be falling apart and no one really seems to know where to go from here.  The amateurish MTV-camerawork of the first part that reminded me constantly of 'Big Brother', appears to be even more annoying in the second part.  Altogether the only one to blame here is the director who has also written the story.  At first, Robert De Niro is good as always and Edward Burns isn't bad.  But unfortunately, once the main and most interesting character in this movie is brutally killed (by the director; not by the two criminals!) I was left empty-handed.

De Niro isn't bad, and he doesn't shine, he just plods along and there's a reason for this - there is no depth to his character, or the plot for that fact.

The performances are great all the way through--from the two villains, Oleg and Emil, to the two (or one, however one might look at it) heroes, Edward Burns and Robert DeNiro.  Correspondingly, the spontaneous direction achieved by John Herzfeld was attention grabbing. This film is about a famed homicide detective teaming up with an arson investigator to try and catch a couple of foreign ex-cons, committing vicious, random acts of violence and videotaping them all as a part of their plot to become media favorites. It has its share of unexpected turns, some predictable, and others you never see coming.  An example of one of these unexpected/predictable turns is the early murder of a major character. Each of these villainous characters has a fascination, one formovie-making and the other with the way in which Americans can easily get away with murder and profit from it at the same time. This interest propels both of them as they get underway on aspontaneous murder spree that ends up earning them the attention they desired and the amount of money they'd requested. The grim violence is quite brutal and some may find it disturbing simply because this movie shows the violence first hand, as it is recorded by Oleg (one of the two villains).  Sadly, the fuel encouraging these violent murders are the news coverage's and the tabloid shows being watched by both criminals. Exploiting the gruesome coverage and expanding the two criminals' fame is the news.  Similarly, the tabloid shows televising other disturbed individuals trying to explain why they committed their crimes, only provide twisted explanations to try and right the wrong (actions already committed). As you watch this movie, all of the intense (murder) scenes are enhanced as one of the killers gives us a first hand perspective of the action as it happens by recording it on his stolen camera.  These images captured by Oleg's camera give disturbing images accompanied with realistic sounds, which really make you feel like you're actually in the scene with them. Despite the criticism this movie might receive, it is crucially necessary to the film in order to provide the `big picture.' In conclusion, this movie isn't quite like the rest in the Action genre. It is an action movie within an action movie.

It starts out as yet another serial killer/cop flick with detective DeNiro and Arson investigator Edward Burns tracking two immigrant killers across New York. They murder a few people in gruesome fashion (including a prostitute -every cheap slasher flick has to have one) and like countless other cop movies there is a chase downtown.  Halfway threw however, the story takes an unexpected turn and the killers become obsessed with becoming famous.  At this point it got a little more interesting, for about 5 minutes, then it headed strait into another line of cliche situations that are designed to make the viewer shake their head and say Yep, that's a problem in the world today.

As I see it, John Herzfeld's second film, starts and ends at this point. The media as a reflector, or a creator of American society.15 minutes evolves around Oleg and Emil, 2 eastern Europeans (Russian and Czech) who come to America for the first time to collect some money from an old friend. As it turned out, the vacation becomes a bloody road to their 15 minutes of fame. Both of them have an obsession for being famous, Oleg as a film creator who documents their trip to America, and Emil as a celebrity murderer. Emil gets the idea that in America no one is responsible for what they do (gee, I wonder where he got that from...) and plots to get away with murder by pleading insanity ... sounds familiar?The 2 roles are played brilliantly by Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov who are both eastern European actors. John Hetrzfeld's real life approach is eminent throughout the entire movie, which makes it all more believable and tense.As things start to get nasty, enter Eddie Fleming, played by Robert De Niro, a celebrity detective who's here to stop Oleg and Emil from doing more killings. Eddie loves the media and the media loves him back. Plus, there are couple of movies about him and he's not at all camera shy. He's friend with the media and he definitely uses it to his advantages.Kelsey Grammer plays a hard core news anchor man, who's thirsty for rating, and what brings rating? Right, violence, sensation, sex, scandals- pretty much everything we see on television today. Kelsey is perfect for the role of the charismatic, slick news presenter, and he doesn't over do it.Jordi Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator who joins Eddie in his chase. The partnership between the two so very different characters is born almost out of coincidence and from the hectic course of events. To me, Burns' character is the sole of the film. He's moral, professional and sensitive (he doesn't watch TV...). Their partnership evolves into a true bond and even a father-child relationship.Aside from the excellent performance of the main actors, as well as the supporting roles, the movie's strength lies in it's realistic feel. Herzfeld's approach, which I mentioned earlier, was to keep everything as close to reality. Starting from the authentic eastern European actors, the real locations, the use of the actors instead of doubles in many of the tense and difficult scenes and the use of the camera. As he explains in the great commentary track, he used mostly panning and long cuts most of the time, instead of fast cutting between shots. We actually see everything as it happens and I think this is a right approach not only to this kind of realistic film , but to any movie.Although the movie is categorized as an action thriller, there is a lot more in it than that. We are talking about mixing genres and breaking formulas. It is obvious that 15 minutes was a film hard to market because of the crossing between action, drama and social-cultural satire. I think most of today's audience is reluctant to accept the break of conventions and New Line really deserves the credit for undertaking such a film.The good news is that the DVD is very popular and I think the film gets its well-deserved recognition from both the public and the critics.The DVDThis impressive package is the second in New Line's Infinifilm series, that promise to take you beyond the movie and delivers.Menus The menus are a real treat, looking like news broadcast of the fictitious Top Story, with clips from the movie and Kelsey Grammer's character as the reporter in the main menu.Extras First and foremost, you get a full length commentary by director john Herzfeld.

This commentary is an experience by itself.Deleted scenes 7 deleted scenes, all of them could have stayed in the final cut, and they give us more info and understanding of the characters. Watching them with the optional commentary of Herzfeld, gives you an insightful look into the film. Really good stuff.These are the features that really completes the film experience.Besides that you get couple of scenes taken with Oleg's camera during the film, a music video (I really like musiv videos on DVDs, they are a part of the film's marketing efforts and you get them with excellent video and quality) and the theatrical trailer.For the Beyond the Movie promise included are 2 interesting documentaries about tabloid media and celebrity criminals and fact subtitles.And last but not least, Infinifilm watching the film with additional clips, footage and info.

Sort of an action film, but also seems to dabble in social criticism.The film is pretty weak when it gets down to it because it tries to be two things at the same time and fails at both of them. It fails as an action film as every time the pace and action heat up the film takes a left turn to take some time on the social commentary tack. It fails on the social commentary tack as I don't think it is making especially profound statements. I suppose it tries to make the case that media's representation of violence perpetuates it. Ho hum... This is something new that we need to be informed of? This has media relationship with the salacious and the violent has been accelerating ever since the OJ case - and everyone knows it and most everyone hates it (but watch it all the same). Since the only way that this will change is if the people who make these decisions for the media refuse to air this stuff - I doubt that anything will ever happen, no matter how many social commentary hollywood films come out.The area of the film that the film was more successful (but in the end wasn't enough to save the film) with was the action sequences. What made these worth while watching was the actors who played the two killers, Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov. They were great fun. Keep your eyes out for both of these actors, they have something. Especially Karel Roden. Apparently he already has proven himself in multiple roles in films marketed outside the US. I can see him playing the heavy on a 007 film. The action sequences were well done and the plot could have been interesting if the whole media angle was dropped. And I hate to say it - but I think that in this case the film would have been better off if the Deniro character survived. I thought the two main characters played by Deniro and Burns had a good repartee and the film started losing its way once the character Deniro plays was killed.Anyway, some good stuff here but nothing to go out of your way to see.

What starts off as a fairly standard `psycho-killers-on-the-loose-in-the-Big-Apple' crime story eventually degenerates into a preposterous, overwrought and laughable mess that makes one wonder how in the world its makers ever got Robert De Niro to agree to star in it.  But star in it he does as Eddie Fleming, a homicide detective so beloved by the citizenry of Manhattan that he enjoys instant celebrity status everywhere he goes.  His face even adorns the cover of People Magazine, which is appropriate, I guess, in the context of the story, because the screenplay, not content with providing a mere murder mystery plot, seems to want to make some kind of profound statement on the coarse media culture we foster in this country.  Unfortunately, the film deals with the topic on such a brainless, unsophisticated and juvenile level that any insights it might hope to deliver are hopelessly lost in a sea of mind-boggling implausibilities.  Chief among these is Kelsey Grammar as a talk show host named Robert Hawkins whose mug seems to be splattered on every bus bench, taxi placard and billboard in New York City.  His actions are so wildly unbelievable that we stand amazed every time he appears on the screen.  Not that the two killers &#150; one an immigrant from Czechoslovakia, the other from Russia - score much higher on the credibility meter.  After brutally killing a half dozen or so people &#150; or at least so it feels from the enormously high body count that the film offers &#150; these two dimwits come up with the brilliant idea of filming a murder, turning the videotape over to Grammar's TV show, then waiting for the cops to come and arrest them on the ingenious premise that the U.S. court system will find them not guilty by reason of insanity and that they will then be free to rake in the dough by selling the movie and book rights to the highest bidder.  I guess that the anti-defamation league for Eastern Europeans doesn't wield much clout in Hollywood or this film would certainly have been picketed at every theatre in which it played.  It's hard to know which aspect is most offensive about these two characters &#150; their murderous brutality or their unprecedented stupidity. Indeed, virtually everyone acts stupidly in this movie &#150; or at least in a manner unbecoming to his or her chosen profession.  We have, for instance, the hotshot, overzealous arson investigator who makes so many blunders in the course of doing his job that one wonders how he is even able to hold onto it for as long as he does.  Similarly, the beautiful reporter who, of course, is the girlfriend of one of the main characters (New York City can, it would appear, be a small world at times) is still allowed to report on the trial of the man who has killed her boyfriend (has no one ever heard of `conflict of interest'?), even though she is not able to get through one line of her report without breaking down.The sheer ludicrousness of the enterprise crystallizes in the film's utterly overwrought final sequence, as all the surviving characters converge at one spot to shout at and shoot at each other.  Despite the rather depressing display of carnage scattered generously throughout this film, `15 Minutes' ultimately provides more laughs than many a comedy we've seen lately.

Indeed, the trailers more imply a film in which the old detective is hunting down a pair of lunatics while they document their own crimes. Where 15 Minutes falls down is the lunatics constantly talking about how in America, nobody is responsible for what they do, and how they plan to get off on insanity pleas and all that jazz. When you videotape yourself talking this way, it's pretty damned hard to actually make it work. A good prosecutor will get their hands on the tape and tell the world that since you had the gall to plan a crime and plan a defence of insanity, you must have been sane enough to understand your own acts. Whoops, there goes the whole message of the film.Massive plot-ruiner ahead, don't read this if you haven't seen the film.Killing off Bob De Niro's character was a big mistake. Once he is gone, there is nobody in the film to root for. The two migrants are so stupid that they could use it as a defense in their murder trial. The other detectives are incidental, and the newscaster is so one-dimensional that the poor actor (is it spelt Kesley or Kelsey?) must feel terminally disappointed in having roles like this after the rousing successes that were Cheers and Frasier. So what, exactly, was the whole point of this film supposed to be? That we as a society have become so depraved that we view murder sprees as entertainment? I already knew America was that bad, but there is a lot of difference between America and the rest of the world.The central message of the film is corrupted (I've already covered that, I think) and the characters are pretty flat and unappealing. The first killing shown in the film has a lot of energy and it makes sense in a psychotic sort of way. However, you don't break off the tip of a knife in a man's spine simply because he owes you money. We should have heard more about the antagonist's experiences in prison. His murderous rage against the first victim would have made a lot more sense that way. Oh, and unlike Man Bites Dog, there are no comedic or even vaguely funny killings. No scaring little old ladies to death (literally), all these killings are strictly by-the-numbers knife jobs. Disappointing when you consider how much novelty they're trying to throw into modern-day slasher pics.All in all, I'm giving 15 Minutes a total of five points. The film started out great, and that's the reason for the five. The second half was pretty pointless and not very entertaining.

I don't know how the U.S. audience reacted to this movie but I can swear here that French teenagers really did love it! For me, it's one of the best action movie I've seen in years. The first reason why it's so great is that after about 15 minutes, you don't know anymore what you should expect. This movie is playing with your reflexes. The story is quite basic 2 guys from eastern Europe come to the States in order to get back their part of the money of the hold up they were in jail for (I hope you understand what I say, because the way I'm writing it may seem confusing!). They arrive at their friend's home and ask him for the money, the problem is that the guy as already spend it all. One of the guys gets mad and kill his friend and his girlfriend. The story could easily stop there, but the other guy, obsessed with movies, as filmed the whole scene, and a girl as seen everything. But she is illegaly in the U.S.A., and so doesn't really seems incline to go to the police. Whatever. 2 very different cops (Robert De Niro, the mediatic one, and Edward Burns, the purely professional one) are on the case... Yes, I know, it doesn't appears like something incredible, but even though we're sure they're going to catch the murderers, the construction of the scenario creates the uncertainess and the suspense. How are they going to find these guys with almost nothing? What are the guys going to do? What's going to happen to the only witness?... Well, you'll now it if you see the movie, but till then I can take the time to write about the directing and the story. John Herztfeld plays with the possibilities offered by the scenario, he films entire scenes with the digital camera of the murderer, using the visual effects and giving a new new vision of the violence. Steven Spielberg prefers filming the faces of the characters in front of horror or inexplainable, but Hertzfeld prefers to show only half of the violence, scarcely hiding it with ugly colors and so on, and leaving us imaginating what we can't see well. Even if the end is quite conventional (if you've seen Seven, you won't be so surprised), the movie is quite agressive. The critic of the trash T.V., of the cowardice of our society which always accuses someone else for its own faults, and of the irrelevantness of American laws is direct and maybe (as some might say) a little to explicit. But the denunciation of the abusive power and moral corruption of the medias which have turned the American audience into peeping Tom's is interesting and highly pleasing the European's audiences (we feel innocents and pure as new born babes when we leave the cinema!!!). It's also very funny and scary to see how in the country of G.W.Bush Jr where executions are aired on T.V., the laws can be used in such a way that the criminals appear like victims and can get money from the atrocities they've done. Obviously, the Son of Sam Law is not at all as well-thought as it seems! To finish with this movie, I recommand it to anyone more than 16 years old (for France) that is not really in love with the States. It interesting , violent, and Ed Burns is the new Richard Gere the ladies were waiting for ,you're going to like him! If you're fan or in love with the bright Bob De Niro, you will be deceived for he doesn't reach the end, and also because this is not at all a new part for him.

A few weeks on though and it's another Oscar winner, Robert De Niro, whose face is everywhere. Fresh from Meet The Parents and Rocky and Bullwinkle, De Niro now stars alongside Edward Burns in Fifteen Minutes and next week with Cuba Gooding jr. in Men of Honour.Focussing on Fifteen Minutes though, De Niro stars as New York cop Eddie Fleming who is probing a double homicide and arson alongside Fire Department investigator Jordy Warsaw (Burns). Meanwhile the perpetrators, two Eastern European criminals, have been filming their actions in the hope of selling their snuff videos to the highest bidder as the American media circus hone in on their crimes. Despite the million-dollar price tag, slick TV journalist Robert Hawkins (Grammar) is keen to get his hands on the tapes in an effort to revive his sliding ratings.Director John Herzfeld uses the film to make a valid point about how the media treat suspected criminals. His tongue in cheek look at America's news hounds is amusing for the most part but by focussing so much on the wider issue he fails to produce an entertaining plot to go alongside it.Kelsey Grammar shrugs off the memories of Frasier Crane by putting in an expert performance as the manipulating journalist Hawkins. Ed Burns too is equally impressive in his first major role since Saving Private Ryan. De Niro on the other hand is wholly disappointing as officer Fleming. The writing may be partly to blame and he's undoubtedly underused, but the hard edge you feel his character should have isn't there and ultimately the appeal of Fleming lacks depth.The two-hour plus running time is excessively long, and there are too many dead-end scenes. Plot strands are left open, for instance Warsaw's possible love interest is suddenly forgotten two-thirds of the way through and much of the plot is unrealistic, specifically the length of time the criminals remain at large and the fact that footage of an actual death is shown on TV. America can be accused of many things but surely not even their TV would sink that low. Well, maybe FOX.In the end though, a promising idea falls flat on its face and De Niro's talent is wasted to boot. Still, at least Kelsey Grammar got to rid himself of that bloody dog from Frasier.5/10Kerry Wilkinson  "},{"Title":"Not excellent, but not terrible","Date":"30 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Robert De Niro returns from ex-CIA agent in Meet the Parents to murder investigator in 15 minutes.ex-convicts arrive at America to collect money from their old pal.

It takes time to slow down, but the camera always seems to  be balancing on its toes, ready to spring into action.  The story concerns two men, who are here in America  to collect money owed to them.  One steals a camera and thus begins taping their various atrocities around  NYC.  All in the attempt to win the attention of the media and in doing that, become rich and famous.  On  the trail of these two are Robert DeNiro and Edward Burns who play members of NYPD and NYFD.  The two  form an unlikely partnership and slowly but surely begin to close in on the two felons.  Kelsey Grammar plays  a news man who will pay top dollar for the tape of the crimes.  What propels this film above other similarly  themed films are the performances of all the actors, especially DeNiro and Burns.  Grammar is quite sleazy  and smarmy, a complete departure from the good natured Frasier Crane.  The action set pieces are  spectacular and really do get your blood moving.  The story moves along quickly to the climax that will have  you sitting on the edge of your seat.  No joke, that's what I was doing.   15 Minutes won't win any awards  for originality but it will entertain you for two hours, and that's why we go to the movies in the first place.

Ed Burns is OK, but seems a bit awkward at times. The villains made little to no sense and there were a number of extra characters that added little to no value to the story.

Edward Burns plays Jordy Warsaw, a fire department arson investigator who, in effect, becomes Fleming's sidekick and student of the media.This movie is really about the media and the cynical use thereof. Specifically it's a punch in the face of tabloid journalism, and the Burns character acts as the meta-conscience with whom we are, presumably, to identify...even as we wallow in the cynicism and feast our eyes on the mayhem and bloodletting.Kelsey Grammar is the tabloid tv producer who takes the punch.The best scenes go to the villains, a Russian and a Czech, who get the ball rolling when they enter the United States in pursuit of their share of a bank heist they helped pull off in the old country. Oleg Taktarov plays the Russian, who was bitten by the film-making bug when he once saw It's a Wonderful Life. So enamored of that film is he (going so far as to register in a hotel under the name, Frank Capra), that he borrows a digi-cam from a shop window in order to begin his own film career in the land of opportunity. And a wonderful life it is that he proceeds to record.The Czech actor, Karl Roden, plays the Czech. Though all the elements of the movie are well done, it would be another run of the mill cop flick if it weren't for Roden's smirking, serpentine villain. He really makes you want to take a shower after it's all over, and I mean that as a compliment.The IMDb credits are a little sketchy, failing to mention Kim Cattrall (tv's Sex and the City) and a noted real-life lawyer, whose name escapes me at the moment. He did a fine job as a thoroughly despicable defense attorney and should be given full credit for his 15 minutes.In sum, news is business and will gravitate toward the bottom line, and that's a shame. Or is it?As I said, this is a slick, commercial production, not gritty realism or art house sensitivity. For what it is--and especially for Karl Roden's villain--I recommend it.

Most movies have all of the people in it mostly alike to make the story better, but that's not how life really is.

All year long (2000-2001) there has been nothing but disappointments.  Sure, there have been great movies like Almost Famous and Gladiator.  But I was sorely disappointed in Traffic and Crouching Tiger.  I haven't been excited about a movie coming out in a LONG time.  So, I was excited about 15 Minutes.  It has DeNiro (who is one of my favorite actors), it has Edward Burns (this guy is going up in this business, he's really good), and a great plot.  Well, guess what?  This is the first time in a long time I have NOT been disappointed.15 Minutes is a violent and mad little movie.  It has its share of flaws. The message in the beginning of the movie is that the media is crazy. After about an hour, that message is lost.  But, it does come back.  I really cannot see why people hate this movie.  I think that because of all the bad movies that have been constantly coming out of Hollywood, critics have been put into a p***ed off mood that when a movie isn't absolutely perfect, they hate it.15 Minutes is fast, fun, violent, and tense.  This movie is filled with edgy suspense.  John Hertzfield (the writer & director) has done a magnificent job of bringing these worlds together.  We see the same story from both sides of the spectrum from the killer's pov and the cop's pov.The acting is beautiful, as is the cinematography.  I think this is some of the best directing I have seen in a while.  I will defiantly start keeping an eye on Hetzfield's career from now on.  Many people say that the colors are too `ugly'.  We'll the movie's topic is ugly.  Fight Club is an `ugly' looking film too, and it's number 40 on the top 250 list.  Yea, the movie is dark.  It's a dark movie.  GET OVER IT.  As long as you can see what's going on, it doesn't matter.My only real problem with the movie is that the movie has mixed tones. Sometimes the music is light and happy, like a comedy.  Sometimes it's brilliantly suspenseful.  The music in this movie is some of the best and worst all year.  It's good b/c when the chase scenes start, there is this brilliant drum beating which helps tense up the scene.  But during some other scenes, the music is awkwardly happy.  Music in film is always hard to explain so when or if you see this movie, take notice to what I'm talking about.Another problem is that I wish that some of the characters could have been a little better developed.  This is not too big of a problem, because this is a character driven movie.  The killer's characters are very well developed. I think the killers are actually the main characters.  But the cops (DeNiro and Burns) are very distant.  We never really get to know too much about Burns's character, except through what happens in the story, AKA, indirect characterization.  But the fine performances, especially by the killers and the supporting cast, well makes up for it.Many people criticize the movie for being `out of date'.  They say that the media is no longer crazy, that the `Jerry Springer' phase is over with, and that the Cold War is done and over with.  The media craziness, unless you people are just blind, still exists.  Remember the 2000 election?  Believe me, the media is just as crazy as it has always been.  The `Jerry Springer' phase refers to the killers.  They are always watching Springer, which is where they learn that Americans are very forgiving.  These killers are from the Czech Republic; they have never seen Springer before.  It interests them, a little too much.  The Cold War reference refers to the movies main characters, the killers.  There is nothing involving the Cold War in this movie.  The main characters are just from the Czech Republic.  Just because two or three of the characters are from Eastern Europe gives no one the right to compare this movie to the Cold War (as some other IMDB critics have done).I really believe that 15 Minutes is one of the best movies I have seen in quite sometime.  Die hard film people will not like this movie because there's nothing too new.  But the average film person (who I always try to represent) will like this movie.  If you're in the mood for a realistic, very well done suspense movie, then check out 15 Minutes.If you don't like movies like 15 Minutes, then why the hell do you go to the movies?  For the hotdogs?

One can only hope that soon, films will be made which dare to expose the unrecognized evils of child molestation, drinking and driving, and cheating at Boggle.This picture is as heavy-handed as they come. The point of the film is to satirize the cultural obsession with violence and celebrity, but the framing gimmick -- two hoods from Eastern Europe film their crimes and plan to get off on an insanity plea, cashing in on their videos -- is so asinine and paper-thin it can't sustain the plot.A satire should reflect the reality of what it's satirizing, and play off that reality. The villains' plot is so absurd and unrealistic that anyone with the slightest familiarity with the object of the satire will realize that it's implausible -- thus blunting the force of the satire's observations.The screenplay is disorganized and rambling and although it does provide a couple of shocks and surprises, we don't really care all that much by that point in the film.The acting is pretty poor as well. In this picture, the two villains get nearly half the screen time. It's a pity, then, that they can't act. Karl Rodin, as the brains of the operation -- what few brains there are -- seems to have researched his role through repeat viewings of Gary Oldman's scenery-chewing performance in Air Force One. His physical resemblance to Oldman is rivalled by his similarly over-the-top style. As his musclebound partner Oleg, Oleg Taktarov has a thankless task -- mixing mindless brutality with bright-eyed naivete. His chops are not up to the task, and the screenplay paints him into such an absurd corner that his comeuppance is literally laughable.DeNiro, reliable as always, delivers a decent performance, marred by an unfortunate, pointless and goopy subplot involving his fiancee. Ed Burns, cast here as a piece of wood, is a bore. He's not helped by a screenplay that hands him more stock cliche cop lines than an old rerun of Police Woman. (My teenaged sisters-in-law liked him plenty, though.) Avery Brooks, best known as Deep Space Nine's Sisko, has a bit part that's surprisingly credible. Kelsey Grammer seems to enjoy a role where he can say f**k half a dozen times in his first few minutes onscreen -- perhaps a bit too much. And mob attorney Bruce Cutler appears in a pointless and lame cameo.There are many, many self-indulgent moments in this picture that don't contribute one whit to the plot or the satire. The editing is so inept that it frequently causes unintentional guffaws.Overall, the film is prententious and tedious; it has pretensions to biting satire but, ironically, in the final analysis it's just another predictable, violent cop melodrama. In fact, in the final moments, a key character gets punched in the face. I literally could count the seconds until it happened. It's that predictable.

Not a new question, certainly, but in light of all the `reality' television shows currently in vogue, `15 Minutes,' written and directed by John Herzfeld, is a timely and pertinent examination of just how much is enough, and how far you really have to go to satisfy a public with an apparently insatiable appetite for violence.  Then again, is this really what people want to see, or is it a matter of unscrupulous network executives purposely feeding the curiosity of the masses and justifying their actions with ratings numbers?  In the 1976 film, `Network,' a programmer negotiates with terrorists to give them their own show; in this movie, the host of a tabloid news program is willing to broadcast live footage of the most repugnant murder and mayhem, claiming it is his `responsibility' to show it because it is `news.' 	The story centers on veteran New York City detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro), who enjoys a certain celebrity due to the fact that many of his cases have been featured on `Top Story,' the `news' show hosted by Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer).  Flemming's notoriety actually facilitates his job to a certain extent, as people open up to him because they know him, or `of' him, at any rate.  But when a pair of criminals-- one a Czech, the other a Russian-- arrive in New York to settle a score after having just been released from prison in their own country, Flemming finds himself involved in a case more bizarre than any he's ever encountered.  For after noting the `success' of a murderer featured on Top Story, the two decide upon a career path for themselves; one that will lead them to fame and fortune.  And their plan is very simple  They will film their crimes and sell the tapes to the station or show that will pay the most-- and they intend on giving Mr. Robert Hawkins first crack at them. 	For the audience, it becomes quite a wild ride, and Herzfeld delivers it all with heart-pounding, adrenaline pumping action, enhanced by a driving soundtrack that keeps you on edge right up to the end.  There's a relentless intensity to this film that never wavers, and there's just enough character development to keep it interesting, along with a couple of plot twists that are so unexpected it is almost unnerving.  Suffice to say, this is not your usual formulaic action/crime drama. 	As always, De Niro, the consummate professional, turns in the kind of performance we've come to expect from him.  He pursues his craft with such finesse and skill that very quickly you know who Flemming is and what he's all about.  Few actors have the ability to so succinctly convey character definition as De Niro does here, and it goes a long way to making this so much more than just an average cop show.  Edward Burns gives a notable performance as well, as Jordy Warsaw, the arson investigator for the Fire Department who teams up with Flemming in pursuit of these psychotic killers who have apparently come to regard violence as an acceptable way of life.  Burns works well with De Niro, and most importantly, he makes his character believable. 	The supporting cast includes Vera Farmiga (Daphne), Melina Kanakaredes (Nicolette), Tygh Runyan (Stephen Geller), Sebastian Roche (Ludwig) and Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov as the killers.  There is such high tension in this film-- the scenes involving the killers are especially frantic, and some of the violence is extremely graphic-- and there is such a pounding rhythm to it that it negates the emotional involvement of the audience to some extent, and at least one element of the plot is so shocking it may leave you nonplused; but in the final analysis, `15 Minutes' is an absorbing, action packed drama that is something of an indictment of the purveyors of sensationalism for it's own sake, as well as those who allow it to proliferate through irresponsible acquiescence.  Not for the faint of heart, but for those who like it served up hard, this will be a satisfying movie-going experience; and one that will stay with you for some time to come.

And, every character in the movie is obsessed with how they look - to their friends, family, on TV, to their co-workers, to their agent, to their client, to their boss, to their fellow countrymen - everyone is touched with a strange obsession over how they appear.The movie draws you in and subtly plays with your assumptions.  The criminals are playing their crimes to their video camera, ensuring appropriate dramatic lighting and composition.  The characters are drawn to cartoon violence, but are time and again brought face to face with the reality of the violence around them and the violence they contribute.Then, at the climax of the movie, your own thirst for more violence is put to the test - do you really want more or don't you?  You're given a chance to reflect on what you want, and whether you want to cheer for violent justice or mercy.I don't know if most of the people who go to see this movie will understand it this way.

It reminded me a bit about Wag the dog (also with De Niro), in that it was based on a simple, appealing idea which unfortunately isn't enough to make a movie on.15 minutes was occasionally funny and smart, but a lot of the satire was so blatant that it seemed aimed at 10 year-olds rather than an adult audience. There was also a strong disconnect between the presentation of the main characters, where the Russians were goofy comic book parodies, while De Niro's super cop had a very different depth and presence. It could be argued that De Niro's superb performance threw the whole movie off-balance, especially the second half. Edward Burns' character might have been interesting, and he played off well against De Niro, but again towards the end everything about him went out the window.There was something almost desperate about the last 20 minutes, which didn't make much sense and was both overstated and unrealistic, even within the framework of a satire. The movie had a certain energy but was amateurish and lacking in both balance and center.

Two Eastern European nut-jobs (Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov) come to the states in the hopes of becoming Hard Copy-styled celebrities by committing murders and video recording them of course. New York's top cop (smashing turn by Robert DeNiro) and an arson investigator (Edward Burns) immediately become the protagonists trying to bring the deranged duo to justice. Of course we all know that is easier said than done in the asphalt jungle of New York City. Melina Kanakaredes (of NBC's Providence fame) is a persuasive reporter who wants the big story at any cost. The fact that she is dating DeNiro just adds friction and stress to the entire picture. Super-slimy tabloid reporter Kelsey Grammar and rarely seen boss Kim Catrall are also along for the feverish thrill-ride. 15 Minutes is one of those near masterpieces that nearly loses its way during its latter acts. The real climax of the picture comes very early and it will leave many dumb-founded and others totally shocked. The screenplay is pretty smart, but the direction is not as crisp as I would have liked. DeNiro by himself makes up for those minor shortcomings as he quietly gives one of his better performances. Watch for super comedian David Alan Grier as a park mugger and the super-sexy Charlize Theron (who also appeared with DeNiro in Men of Honor) as the head of an escort service. 4 stars out of 5.

It was unexpected but at the same time a little anti climactic. At this point what had been a fairly standard Hollywood buddy cop film takes a rapid slide into a nonsensical movie cliche, almost a parody. The up until that point more or less mild mannered arson investigator suddenly cracks and goes into a cop out for revenge mode. This made no sense at all. The only likable character in this film is another cliche, the big dumb Russian guy who just wanted to be a filmmaker. To call the ending predictable would be a gross understatement. Just when they get the evidence they need to put the bad guy away, he grabs a hostage and our arson detective shoots him 6 times (1 was enough to release the hostage, 5 more in the chest killed him). Why does Hollywood always do this? Do they think viewers won't have closure if the bad guy is taken away by the cops at the end instead of being killed? In real life, there are SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES for shooting suspects. And the guy who shoots him isn't even a cop.*** END SPOILERS ***So much of this movie just didn't make sense or was completely implausible.

James Handy as the fire chief was absurdly overbearing (and over-acting), as was Avery Brooks as De Niro's partner.  I am usually a fan of Brooks no matter how silly his role, but here it just added to mess.  De Niro goes through the motions and does not give the audience enough to like or dislike his character.  Kelsey Grammar was great in his first scene but somehow falls flat in the rest of his execution.  Burns is adequate, but not yet strong enough to truly carry a movie such as this.  I liked him much better in Saving Private Ryan and Life or Something Like it.  The eastern European criminals were just silly.  They repeatedly killed people brutally but I just could not find myself being scared of them.The entire underlying theme that the public view matters more than reality did not seem to make much sense as presented by the story.  It is not believable that some mugger without a shred of proof could get a respected fireman with a spotless record into such trouble just because the news media played up his barely news-worthy story.  Would a news show host really throw down a million dollars of his personal money in the situation where Kelsey Grammar's character did?  I just don't buy it.The movie was not a complete waste of 2 hours.  There were some interesting scenes and some decent action to keep things moving.  John Gotti's actual attorney represents the criminal in a clever touch.  The booby-trapped apartment fire was very cool.

While there are some moments of (intentional) comedy, this is clearly meant to be a serious thriller, about a serious subject, i.e. the role and responsibilities of The Media in society. If this was a wacky, *Dr Strangelove*-style satirical comedy, everything would fit just fine. If this was a fantasy, full of magical powers and mythical creatures, we could suspend our disbelief. But the characters in this movie are supposed to inhabit this world, and they just don't.

In 15 Minutes, he gets to do the latter in a role that he was born to play. His sharp look and his dark eyes he could make any criminal run and hide. He shapes this shaky material and turns it into gold. Emil (Karel Rodin) and Oleg (Oleg Taktarov) have just flown into the United States from the Czech Republic. They land in New York to find money that is owed to them. Oleg steals a video camera from a New York store to videotape the two making their business transactions. He records Emil brutally murder a business associate and his wife. They too decide to sell this tape to a greedy newscaster, Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer) to earn a little money. Hawkins buys these tapes in an attempt to up his ratings. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) and Eddie Flemming (DeNiro) all have the task of tracking down these homicidal maniacs. 15 Minutes steps on familiar territory. It tries to prove to us that the media is a powerful thing and people will do anything to become famous. But, in a world with Survivor and Temptation Island we already know this. The film was originally supposed to be released in 1999 and sadly, the film's poke at the media is now a tired one. 15 Minutes also doesn't know which way it's going. It starts out as a stirring analysis on social behavior, but then turns into a shoot 'em up cop thriller. Luckily for the audience, 15 Minutes tries harder to be a true action drama than a social analysis. It works better that way. Herzfeld has a wonderful eye for setting up great action sequences and paying them off. After it drops the weight of sermonizing, it kicks into full gear and gets to wander free. Burns and DeNiro work well together, creating a vicious force to be reckoned with. The two have fun banter back and forth that could only be performed by two such great actors. Burns gets to explore himself more and finally step out of the romantic comedy box he puts himself into. Jordy's romance with Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga) is underdeveloped and lagging, but his character is detailed and unfolded nicely. Karel Rodin and Oleg Taktarov, at times, steal the show from Burns and DeNiro. They give the characters a refined edge and savvy wickedness. Herzfeld makes the good choice to make us understand the killers and skips the faceless killer cliché that so many action films get sucked into. We get a peek into their minds and we see what makes them tick. Understanding the killers makes for a better payoff in the end. There are many kinks that need working out in 15 Minutes. But, Herzfeld has the right moves and gives us spectacular action that make the film worth sitting through. ---------6/10 "}{"Title":"This film never quite tells the audience what it is supposed to be.","Date":"22 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  SPOILERS - The title 15 Minutes is a reference to the old saying that everyone gets their 15 minutes of fame.

Our hero, Andy Defrene, had to crawl through a filthy, stinking sewer pipe to eventually gain his reward, freedom.  Watching 15 Minutes, half-way through I felt that I was in that same sewer pipe, and if I stuck with it I would eventually get my reward. I never did get out of that sewer pipe!Robert DeNiro as the homicide detective, and Edward Burns as the Fire Dept arson detective, are both good in their roles. Two Eastern European thugs come to NYC to collect their money from a comrade, but he had already spent it all. Enraged, the worse of the thugs kills him, then kills the wife, they burn the apartment to make it look like an accident. This results in DeNiro's and Burns' characters meeting, and becoming partners of sorts.The less evil thug steals a video camera, and decides he will make a movie of their dirty deeds, getting the murders, and subsequent events, on tape. They sell it to the newsman (Kelsey Grammer) for a $Million, and state if we get caught, we'll be declared insane, etc because in America, land of the free, home of the brave, anyone can get rich. Interestingly DeNiro gets killed off rather early, but Burns sees to it that the bad guys get their due at Battery Park, with the Statue of Liberty in the background shot.There are several problems with this movie, and my most generous rating is 5 of 10 for some good moments, most of them funny, and the very end where the baddest of the bad guys gets about 97 rounds pumped into him from Burns' little handgun. That's part of the problem, is this supposed to be somewhat serious, or just a badly done dark comedy? Too many of the situations were absurd, for a serious film. And there was way too much gore and violence for this to be a credible dark comedy. I would not have watched it but our neighbor loaned us their DVD.

You probably ask yourself why I tell you this, well this movie isn't about people who compete with each other in one of those series (although some studios are probably thinking about making such a movie right now), but about two men who will do anything to become famous, even when that means they'll have to commit a horrible murder.Oleg Razgul and Emil Slovak are two Eastern European criminals who come to New York to pick up their share of a heist score. But when Oleg steals a video camera and starts filming their legal and illegal activities, they soon want more than the money from the heist, they want to become really rich and very famous. When they learn how the American media circus can make a remorseless killer look like a victim and make him rich by buying his story, they get an idea. They'll choose a famous target, in this case the NYPD Homicide Detective Eddie Flemming who is very known in the media, torture and kill him and sell the images to the local tabloid TV show 'Top Story'...I guess you could say that this movie not only has some biting criticism for all those people who would do everything for a little bit of fame and fortune, but also excellently criticizes the role of the media and some lawyers who will only defend someone when they see some good publicity in it. And I guess the main issue here is that it isn't even exaggerated. The bloodier, the better seems to be the motto for many news bulletins nowadays, especially in the USA (if you don't believe me watch Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine). And even the lawyers who will use and abuse every possible law to keep their client out of prison isn't new. In fact you could say that this movie tells a story that could be based on true events...The story and the acting in the movie certainly aren't bad, especially Robert De Niro did a nice job, but also people like Kelsey Grammar and Edward Burns are very nice to watch. Even Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov play their roles of the Eastern European criminals very convincingly. But somehow this movie never really got away from that typical 'Hollywood' feeling. Although sometimes it certainly offers a more original approach, in the end it's a bit predictable. Of course the villains were dumb and completely amoral foreigners (American bad guys always seem to be smarter in the movies) and yes they didn't hesitate to use excessive violence. Just shooting their victims with one or two bullets wasn't enough, it had to be a lot more complicated than that. Still, that doesn't mean that the movie isn't any good. As I already said, it offers a lot of criticism and that's probably also the main reason why so many professional reviewers didn't like it all that much. Saying that your employer and the business you're working in is amoral and blood thirsty might cost you your job and who will employ you once you've said such a thing. But I'm not a professional, so I can write whatever I want and I say that despite the fact that it sometimes is a bit predictable, this still is a good movie that deserves to be seen.

Also, for a movie that takes itself very seriously, it just didn't come across as very believable. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what's wrong with it, but neither the characters nor the plot came across as very convincing.

Actually to be fair 15 Minutes probably seemed pretty good on paper. There's a surprise midway through that I'm sure De Niro thought would turn out to be respectable - but the problem is that due to false marketing it just makes his fans very mad.The roles aren't as clichéd as I expected and neither is the movie - unfortunately it DOES become quite clichéd when it resorts to a silly violent ending. It's a huge contradiction - it preaches against violence but presents a world in which ruthless villains commit brutal murders. It's saying to us, The media focuses on violence too much - so here's some more for you to admire while we're preaching you about how bad it is.This movie is extremely gritty and its brutality amidst accusations strikes a raw chord - at least for me. I found it a bit too over-the-top like some sort of Paul Verhoeven wannabe, lacking the satirical edge of RoboCop or even the mediocre Starship Troopers. At least that movie had a point, as muddled as it may have been.15 Minutes tries to have a point. It thinks it is clever, but it is not.

I'll admit that I found it somewhat better, at least as passable entertainment - unfortunately due to its moral message and how bad it is at successfully conveying it, I find it hard to just pass it off as a mere buddy movie. It's trying to be something more, which is its hugest flaw.

Part of the time it is a poorly-conceived satire, the rest of the time it's a pretty dull cop movie. It's an attempt to catch some of the fire from Natural Born Killers while actually missing its point entirely by working from the good guys' point of view.Instead of Mickey and Malory, we get a pair of Russian immigrants with a video camera. Instead of Wayne Gale we have a rarely seen Kelsey Grammer as a shock-TV host. Where Scagnetti used to be, we now have spotless Robert De Niro the cop, and Edward Burns the righteous arson investigator. The killers aren't complicated human beings with souls, like in Stone's film, instead one is a psycho and the other a dim-witted movie nut. Fresh off the boat, they immediately steal a camcorder and they're off to kill some people they knew back home. When they burn the apartment of their victims, our hero Burns (gag!) shows up. Immediately, he is made out to be an anything-to-bring-down-the-bad-guys type cop (or fireman, the point is he wants to be Dirty Harry). De Niro is the cop/celebrity-hero who must team up with Burns to bring the foreigners to justice.None of these ideas seem to have been given much thought by writer/director Herzfeld. Some scenes seem to try to develop character or establish motivation, but it never makes any headway. The plot is really just rubbish and Herzfeld the director never does anything to make us forget this. It wants to be smart and satirical like Natural Born Killers, but it has none of the incredible visuals, editing, performances, or dialogue that made that movie a winner. Meanwhile, it has the same weaknesses as NBK, having zero subtlety and a tendency to preach. Herzfeld's roots as a TV director are obvious all the way through this poor excuse for a movie. The failure of the movie to be original or to pose any real drama around real characters make it dull and uninvolving.This is yet another sad waste of Robert De Niro, who is in more and more crap these days. Anybody thinking of seeing this movie should just spare themselves some torture and see the movie this tried to be, Oliver Stone's far superior Natural Born Killers. 15 Minutes simply isn't worth your time.

Its ability to strike at nerves certainly explains why many mainstream critics, who mistaking believe that they are part of the media with the rest of the journalists, either blasted the movie as manipulative and ugly or intentionally dismissed it as a standard cop flick.  In `15 Minutes' writer/director John Herzfeld has channeled his spite against the media into this provocative, fire-breathing satire about how the news media can unknowingly participate in a cycle of violence they believe to only be covering - and how it presents America to the rest of the world.  I don't use the term provocative very often, but this thriller effectively got my blood boiling - in a good way.In one of the many more subtle ironies of `15 Minutes', Herzfeld pretty much hands over the staring roles to our villains - two Czech men played for such fist-clenching hatred by Oleg Taktarov & Karel Roden.  We first see them breeze past airport security and enter New York City with ideas of becoming rich and famous in Frank Capra's America dancing in their heads. Their line of logic plays out rather understandably. Violence and murder + camera x a media willing to make celebrities out of them = fame, fortune and TV movies of the week. So enters our trusty news anchor (Kelsey Grammer) who is one to race for the bottom with a story and a presumptuously desensitized attitude towards the public regardless of rather or not his audience a) is ready for it or b) wants it in the first place. They are going to get it anyway. Our two villains help set fuel to a fire of news media hysterics - as the movie gleefully depicts it. If anything I think 15 Minutes doesn't go far enough in it's parody.During one of their impromptu killings they burn down the victims' apartment bringing  together the seemingly mismatched pair of experienced celebrity cop Robert DeNiro (who else?) and arson investigator Ed Burns. It sounds a little cliché and it feels like it sometimes, but rest assured this is a conventional action movie with a brain.and a few genuine surprises up its sleeve. Herzfeld goes for a gutsy, more complex ending as well. Satisfying the audience's blood-lust where reality rarely does, he stretches the movie straight down the line of satire to an appropriately absurd climax. Where our happy ending is like a pill, sometimes only able to be washed down with vigilantism and anarchy.The director of the forgettable `2 Days in the Valley' (look for Charlize Theron in a cameo), Herzfeld proves beyond competent with the movie's action set pieces. Weather having our heroes kidnap Olga from the police and race him out of the city or staging a nail-biting arson attack on Burns' apartment, Herzfeld knows how to keep the screws tight. The movie is visual eye-candy thanks to both Jean-Yves Escoffier's slick cinematography and a vibrant color palette that splashes across the screen like a graphic novel. It's one of the better looking action movies in recent memory.Even better is Anthony Marinelli's original score that balances the schizophrenic tones of the film. At times intense, at times playful. That `Fight Club'-esque balancing act between rib-poking humor and brutal violence - which Herzfeld juggles like an acrobat - caused a few studios to play hot potato with the movie in the post-Columbine social climate. When the smoke cleared it landed in the lap of what I think is today's gutsiest studio New Line Cinema. `15 Minutes' is a pulse-racing, well made, wickedly cathartic slap across the face to those who rarely get such treatment and one of the more subversively daring movies of the year. It may come a little late for contemporary critics, but history might smile on this title. Good stuff.

Okay, they're recent Russian immigrants but they're quick studies.The plot gets kind of complicated, although the underlying message is simple enough. (Our entertainment is dumbed down while being made even less suitable for family viewing.) It's not slow. It zips along quickly, nervously, so our attention doesn't wander, and in a way that's part of the problem. It's really kind of enervating to watch. There's plenty of action and lots of gore. Fires burst out unexpectedly, heroes get knocked off half-way through the film, people spit blood at one another, Emil the head Russian honcho is groomed to look like Chicotilo, Russia's famous serial murderer, brains are blown out, people run full tilt against oncoming traffic on a crowded New York Street. And the camera seems constantly in motion, panning this way and that, following characters or vehicles. Lots of shouting goes on. The director shoves looming closeups in our faces, and they're not the faces of pretty young women like DeNiro's fiancée, but the faces of the two ugly Russkies. My God, can they sweat. Sometimes we see events as they're being filmed through the videocamera, the images pirouetting dizzyingly on the screen, and just once (out of boredom, or what?) the director uses high-contrast multiple images that are to the eyes what a screeching piece of chalk on a blackboard is to the ears. When it's all over, we find ourselves panting with exhaustion.DeNiro is okay. I've gotten to feel as if I've known him over the years, warts and all, maturing from a twentyish kid to a middle-aged man. He's like an old friend you're glad to run into once in a while. Burns I've never seen before, but he seems likable. His face is a bit off. In the Frankfort horizontal plane it seems normal enough, with even features, not quite handsome, which is just fine. His eyelids slant downward over the outer canthus, the opposite of an Asian's. In profile his slender nose seems to protrude in the shape of a perfect right triangle. His voice is a combination of a whisper and a muted croak. But it isn't at all menacing, the way, say, Michael Masden's is. It's the New-York-tinted voice of some guy who works at the desk next to yours in a shabby government office. Wouldn't mind seeing more of him. I also enjoy Burns' boss, what's his name, Handy? An old reliable and a fine support or character actor. Many of the better comedies have underlying darker themes, like All's Well That Ends Well, but this is a drama with a humorous undertone. The idea is kind of silly but when something bad happens, it still kind of hurts, as it's supposed to. I wish the director had had enough confidence to tell the story straight. There's a lot of stylistic icing on this insubstantial cake. The movie is definitely worth seeing, but take a Xanax beforehand, because afterward your nerves will be shot.

The old 15 minutes of fame adage is taken to a rather disturbing extent in this film, in which a couple of men, Emil and Oleg (who sound like characters from some sort of prehistoric Far Side cartoon), from Russia and Czechoslovakia, respectively, come to America in search of easy riches, and they choose to use our own media against us in order to get it. Literally minutes off the plane, Oleg steals a high priced digital video camera from an electronics store, playfully documenting his and Emil's activities before later deciding (after accidentally videotaping Emil's first murder) that his video will be the huge reality documentary that will make him rich and famous.There is a point in the movie where Emil and Oleg sit in a Planet Hollywood while the tape that they shot of the murder is played for the public to see, and they sit there loudly arguing and not seeming to notice or care as people left and right begin to recognize them as the men on the tape, which seems to be a point where the movie digresses a little too far from reality, but their intentions must be considered before any conclusions are formed about how realistic it really is. These guys are planning to sell their video to Hollywood so that it can generate massive amounts of money from what will surely be the public's wild desire to see it simply because it's sick and twisted, meanwhile they'll plead insanity and get off with a short stay in a mental hospital after which they will be free to enjoy the riches that they acquired through theft and murder. In this case, it's not so hard to believe that they would sit in the middle of a crowded Planet Hollywood and watch the tape of the murder, which clearly shows both of their faces. Hey, they're insane, remember? (spoilers)There are a lot of things that this movie has to say about the entertainment industry, particularly that involved with showing the public `what they want to see.' Kelsey Grammer plays the unenviable role of the reality television host who claims to want nothing more than to give the public what they want, but is clearly after nothing other than massive ratings. There is genuine surprise in this film, and while this particular plot event is undeniably unforeseen, it's not exactly a pleasant surprise. Robert DeNiro, no doubt the main reason that at least half of the film's viewing audience decided to watch the film at all, plays the role of Eddie Fleming, a New York detective who works with the younger and presumably less experienced Jody Warsaw (played expertly by Edward Burns), and has also managed to get himself well known around New York through the very avenues of public broadcast that ultimately televise his murder. Fleming has attained a small level of fame through his work as a detective, and he occasionally uses this to his benefit during investigations. The surprising twist is not the irony involved with his murder being broadcast on the very cable show that has worked to his benefit (and, I remind you, there are spoilers ahead!), but rather in the fact that DeNiro's character was killed at all. Indeed, he suffered a brutal murder, and it's harder to watch DeNiro go through that than it is to imagine the actual death that is meant to be portrayed.The only thing that I didn't like about Training Day (and, by the way, I'm about to spoil that movie too!), is the ultimate fate of Denzel Washington's character. Granted, it was an entertaining film (although a little too preoccupied with violence), but there are just some things that simply can't be done to an actor like Denzel Washington. The man's LOVED. In 15 Minutes, we get a film that is shamelessly concentrated on violence and murder, so at least it's not as much of a shock when one of our film heroes gets killed, and at least he didn't turn out to be a bad guy, but it still remains a questionably justified death.  15 Minutes as a whole is a wildly entertaining and fast paced thriller, with a couple of brilliant performances from the relatively unknown (in America, at least) Oleg Taktarov as the charming but vicious filmmaker Oleg, and Karel Roden as the wonderfully hate-able Emil, bent on becoming violently rich and never being spoken to in Russian. The very end of the film is really the only place where it sinks almost to the level of the cheesy action b-movie, with the hero delivering a swift punch in the nose to the person who has been a thorn in everyone's side for the whole movie, and then walking off dramatically into the distance as the authorities who would in real life bust him for assault throw him an approving nod. It's too bad that they decided to end an otherwise smartly written, if at times almost disturbingly violent, film with a childish conclusion like this, because the rest of the movie is so entertaining and well-presented that it's just a shame to be left with a bad taste at the very end. But despite any amount of childishness at the conclusion of the film, 15 Minutes is definitely a well-made thriller that presents a rather far-fetched story that, when you really think about it, may not really be that far-fetched at all, which makes it all the more effective. Watch it for the acting, the action, and the story, try to ignore that ending, and you'll love it.

I bought it on video after I had seen a preview for it on the film FINAL DESTINATION. And that was one of the smartest things I had done that week. 15 MINUTES is one action packed thrill ride of a movie! Here's the story(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) two eastern European criminals come to the United States looking for money owed to them, but end up killing the people in debt. After that, they begin committing a series of video taped murders and turning the streets of New York into their battleground. Here's where a legendary cop named Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) comes in. Him and a rookie arson investigator (Edward Burns). Together, they must stop the rampage. This movie gives a good look at the world today. It shows how people are never punished for their crimes (well, not always). They come up with a motive to plead insane to the court that tries them, get sent to a mental hospital and then plead sane once they are in the hospital. Have tests run on them, certify that they are sane, leave the asylum- rich and famous. And because of the double jeopardy law, not be tried for the same crime twice. An ingenious plan. Today, if people didn't know any better, that would work. It shows how people don't take enough action towards murderers and other criminals. But, then there are some of the action sequences. Intense. The scenes that go through the video camera we also great. Negative art and other video effects are used. It is also nice to see Kelsey Grammer (in a role other than his usual sissified character Frasier) as a tabloid reporter who is just looking for good ratings on his late night show. This is one action thriller than delivers the goods. It is different, and in the end, everything goes about happily. However, that is not always the case in real life, but since this is film, happy endings and stupid stuff are allowed. But stupid this movie is not. *MAJOR SPOILER* I am only so upset that half-way through the movie (Prepare yourself if you haven't seen the movie) Robert De Niro's character is killed!!! That is the worst part of the entire movie! I was shocked beyond belief. Since he is listed as the main character in this film, I was expecting him to have survived somehow by some magic leap of faith, but no! It is up to Edward Burns to save the rest of the movie. And that he does. He should be listed as the film's central character and Robert De Niro the second. But since De Niro is a bigger name that Burns is, that's how things are going to go. 15 MINUTES was definetly the year's best action thriller. I give this one 5/5.

The movie is just as confused as Natural Born Killers, but a lot easier on the eyes (and ears).  The director doesn't go over the top, but unfortunately Kelsey Grammer does.  He must have had it in his contract where he had to say the F word in every line.  I guess those years of repressing strong profanity on TV have worn him down.  Had the movie removed the satire elements, it would have been a straight, violent thriller and would have worked better (at least in my opinion).  The murder scenes are quite brutal but the film makes a big mistake by making one of the Eastern Europeans (the one who films while the other kills) a hero.  Another mistake is made by making these killers act so silly.  While the guy who is filming doesn't actually commit the murders, he is just as guilty.  A bizarre and unsuccessful movie, with a few unexpected cameos.

His last feature, `2 Days in the Valley' with James Spader, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels and Teri Hatcher was a deserved critical, if not commercial, success.  Armed with a screen legend and socially-aware subject matter in `15 Minutes', Herzfeld mixes exciting action fare with an attempt to instil a deeper commentary about media obsession with tragedy.Eddie Fleming (De Niro) enjoys the media attention that has turned him from successful homicide detective to celebrity.  By ensuring that unethical TV anchorman, Robert Hawkins (Grammer - TVs `Frasier'), is on the scene during his major busts, Fleming manages to get his face on TV more so than your average cop.  A suspicious fire at an apartment block brings Fleming together with arson investigator, Jody Warsaw (Burns - `The Brothers McMullan', `She's the One').  They realise that the fire is no accident and embark on a homicide investigation.Released convicts, Emil (Karel Roden) and Oleg (Oleg Taktarov), come to New York to find the former partner they owes them money.  When they find Milos (Vladimir Mashkov) they discover that he has spent their share of the money and in a fit of rage, Emil murders Milos and his wife, before burning their apartment block down to cover their tracks.  Unwittingly Oleg captures the murders on a video camera that he had stolen and after witnessing American TV's obsession with violence and those who commit violent acts, Emil and Oleg realise that they can become rich and famous by making their murders public.  They know the unethical TV anchorman that will buy their movie, now they just need a high-profile target.De Niro has been acting-by-numbers for some time now, but even when he is, he's still head and shoulders above pretty much everyone else.  `15 Minutes' is no different.  The only character here with any sense of depth, De Niro delivers a layered performance as the expert cop who has trouble with the bottle as well as expressing his love for his reporter girlfriend (Melina Kanakaredes - TVs `NYPD Blue').On the flip side, Ed Burns struggles to play a convincing action man, and Kelsey Grammer is totally miscast as the cynical TV piranha.  The schizophrenic paranoia of the European killers, Roden and Taktarov, works pretty well despite a seeming slide into almost comic-book bad-guy parody at times.Herzfeld keeps things moving pretty well with some excellent action sequences, but the balancing act between balls-to-the-wall action and the `media preoccupation with violence is bad' social commentary, waters things down too much.  You are left with the thought that either this is a serious movie that pokes fun at its own plot or a light-hearted yarn that takes itself too seriously.  In essence the movie lies awkwardly between two stools, and no doubt it's crying out 'I've fallen and I can't get up'.Rating ** "},{"Title":"Don't even waste 15 minutes watching","Date":"27 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Implausible and derivative film chock full of TV actors (Kelsey Grammer, Kim Cattrall, Avery Brooks) that fails at every turn.

What the movie really is, of course, is a prime example of what it claims to expose, violence and pornography. There's enough blood in this film to float a battleship, enough violence - especially against women - to satisfy the most misogynistic psychopath.

Not unexpectedly, the vicious criminals in this movie are all blacks or vicious immigrants, the victims are beautiful white women, and the heroes are the police and firemen.

And then chucks it all to become a manipulative, run of the mill, get the bad guy, schlock Hollywood movie. It seems the rest of the cast and crew decided to mail it in as well. The cinematography is boring. The acting is unimaginative (Does de Niro have to reference back to one of his classic roles in every new movie he is in?). You can see every plot turn coming 10 minutes ahead of time. It's like the movie was put together with a cop movie hobby kit.

Or gay guys, or anybody else who loves looking at gorgeous, soulful men. In New Line's latest, Fifteen Minutes, we are talking about Robert de Niro and Ed Burns. Overheard leaving the theater, one charming fellow to another 'Ed Burns really has to learn how to act.' Not with that face, pal!The film gets its title from the Andy Warhol quote, 'In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.' And in our media saturated net/TV/radio/cel phone existence, this ridiculous prophecy is coming all too true. There is sad irony this film is released a few days after another high school shoot out. The film's tag line, America Likes to Watch ought to give anyone the willies.But back to the movie, the supporting cast is fab. We get to see Avery Brooks (who didn't have nearly enough to do and knew it) and a charming cameo by David Allen Grier. This movie was lovingly shot on location in New York (and co-produced by de Niro's own Tribeca) and features a supporting cast of wonderful NY actors and actresses that is a refreshing change from the overused LA casting pool. Attention fans of TV's Law and Order. It's that same crowd and that same look.Another treat, we get really nasty Russian bad guys. (Yea! We get to hate Commies again!) Czechoslovakian actor Karel Roden and Siberian, Oleg Taktarov are wonderful psychotic thugs entering the USA to find their bank robbing partners that got away with the loot while they went to prison. Oleg loves movies and steals a video camera in Times Square. His movie is the movie inside the movie.They find their partners and then the crime spree kicks into high gear. There's a fire and NYFD arson investigator played by Ed Burns gets in cahoots with media darling homicide detective played by Robert de Niro. There is a lot of punching, car and foot chasing (through traffic yet) and of course shooting. Blood and roses too.Ironically, the real villain of this film is the sleazy tabloid news anchor, played by a smarmy Kelsey Grammar who buys the criminal's video tape, giving these creeps their '15 minutes' and real life consigliere, Bruce Cutter, plays himself. Does a damn fine job too.The sleaze is counter-balanced with the two very classy female leads, Melina Kanakaredes and Vera Farmiga. Both strong and smart, and, how nice, neither one of them is a prostitute or a stripper. I almost thought I would see a movie with either of those. Oh, but I was wrong, there is one female sex worker represented, but even she is surprisingly healthy before she gets naked and killed.Writer/director John Herzfeld, of 2 Days In the Valley fame does a mighty fine job. The overall tone is dark, rough, funny and violent. The look is strictly MTV, very stylish skitzy quick cutting rock video. But be warned this is an extremely violent and bloody film. The required trendy hip-hop compilation soundtrack includes a cover of Bowie's Fame. Ha ha, I get it.Like Judy told Liza, it's OK to steal, just steal from the best. There is a shot early in the film of a NY street at night, a sweeping pan of emergency vehicles that was reminiscent of the last shot of Taxi Driver.

It was his impromptu decision to run into the audience during one of his shows that led to the development of the participatory talk show.  Once he had established himself, others tried to wrest away his talk show crown, spawning Oprah, Montel Jerry Springer and a host of others where the audience fights for their chance at video immortality.  This trend for the outrageous led to Tabloid TV, with the likes of Hardcopy,  and National Enquirer and evolved into reality programming, with shows like When Animals Attack, and  World's Worst Police Chases II.  The media is only too willing to provide people with their time in the spotlight, and the more outrageous, the better the ratings.  Damn you Phil!America is touted as the land of opportunity, and no one knows that better than the international criminal element. Emil and Oleg, recent Eastern European émigrés, decide that the quick route to infamy and wealth is to exploit the thirst for bleeding edge news with a killing spree caught on video.   All they have to do is turn on the camcorder and start the killing.  Charged with capturing these stars is supercop Eddie Fleming, a media savvy homicide detective.  He is assisted by Jordy Warsaw, a naïve fire investigator unfamiliar with the system, and shadowed by Robert Hawkins, a tabloid tv reporter / media whore whose motto is If it bleeds, it leads. The writers of Fifteen Minutes had the opportunity to seriously examine the media's role in immortalizing criminals. To their credit, the first two thirds of the film are well written, and the characters are believable. Unfortunately the last half-hour of the film is rife with the very flash and melodrama that it is supposedly condemning, and the film spirals into the absurd. Every Hollywood cliche that comes to mind, from fake deaths, deathbed confessions, wild shoot-outs, and pat endings is thrown into the mix, for an uninspired, disingenuous wrap-up.  Robert De Niro, is, well, Robert De Niro.  An actor's actor, he always does what it takes to get the character, whether that means gaining forty pounds to play Jake LaMotta, or having his hair thinned with tweezers to play Scarface, he gives it his all.  As Eddie Fleming, his is the only character with true screen presence and the source of the one truly emotional scene in the film.  Edward Burns (Jordy) lacks the range necessary to carry off his character and is relegated to silly sidekick.  Karl Rodin and Oleg Tarthakov (Emil and Oleg) are not crazy enough to be frightening, and become a parody of Abbot and Costello (except that they happen to use guns).  Finally, Kelsey Grammar's sniveling take on Hawkins is a caricature of everything bad about the reality tv genre and offers little insight.  I did however enjoy Bruce Cutler's cameo as a slimy opportunistic lawyer (he was John Gotti's lawyer when he was still known as The Teflon Don), quite a stretch I'm sure.Once again, a film with a potentially powerful message is dumbed down and panders to the very interests it supposedly takes issue with.

Why did it fail? For one, the rampaging murderers (Eastern Europeans, OF COURSE) didn't have a strong enough motive for doing what they did. They didn't begin with a strong desire to have an overexposed OJ Simpson experience, so why did they revert to those objectives mid-film? Second, there are way too many shoot-outs with very little NYPD interference. These days in New York, if you so much as kick a can down the street, you have the boys on blue knocking you up against a wall. So how can fifteen minute shoot-outs occur with absolutely no police presence? Please. Also, Kelsey Grammar's slimy lawbreaking antics involving the murder tapes would result in his public hanging, not his continued on-air presence. I really wanted this one to work.

Never mind that the cold war has been over for over a decade, teenage fanboy John Herzfeld still thinks he's making some deep social commentary by having these guys film their crimes and become famous for it.  Of course, Herzfeld couldn't even make pop trash like 2 Days in the Valley work, so how is he going to pull off deep social commentary?He's not, and instead he's going to offend every human on Planet Earth who's not as rich and white as HE is.  The message we can take away from this film is Foreigners are bad and we need to keep an eye on them.  Herzfeld wasn't smart enough to make this movie work with AMERICAN antagonists, so instead he decides to make them foreigners so the American audience could more easily hate them.  If there was any American distrust or dislike of immigrants in the audience BEFORE seeing this 'film', this movie does its best to throw gallons of gasoline on the fire.  If there ever were a more offensive, short-sighted execution of an idea, I'm sure it was done by men in white sheets.The idea behind this film is valid, somewhere-- that we no longer know whether our culture spawned the media, or vice versa.

Do they succeed in their motive? Well, that is basically what the movie is, about. Any guesses, as to the nationality of the immigrants? Why, one is a Russian and the other one, Czech, of course! And the cold war goes on! Dark, yet commercial, 15 MINUTES, is a movie, well made. The visual effects are quite admirable. It also, has an element of 'suspense' in it, and throughout its runtime, there is always a feeling of 'what will happen next?', which keeps the viewer glued till the 120th minute. The acting is great. The 'East European' villains put up a convincing performance. Robert De Niro, a classic actor he is, always out -does the rest of the cast in every movie he acts. In this one, however, his part is not justified. In fact, I feel, his talent is wasted, for the role he plays in this flick. As a result, he is overshadowed, alas! One thing, I would like to highlight, is the performance of Kelsey Grammer. A known comedian, for his roles in the TV. Programs, FRASIER and CHEERS, his role is drastically different from his comic roles. He plays, a sort of a baddie, in this movie, and let me tell you, he can act, and he can act, well. Anyway, 15 MINUTES is fantastic, entertaining, and it makes you think, too.9/10 RATING. "},{"Title":"Really, really bad movie.","Date":"24 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  It's the end of August 2001, and this is still the worst movie I've seen this year.  The acting was bad, except for Edward Burns, but the script was so ridiculous even the best acting in the world couldn't have saved it.  If you're looking for a good action film, you should look elsewhere. "}]
