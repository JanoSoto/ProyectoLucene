[{"Title":"No kidding - I loved it!","Date":"11 July 2000","Score":"23 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money.  But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone.   He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this film on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults.  This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children - it is lumped in with trailers for Rugrats the Movie, and Pokemon 2000 (aren't they passe yet?).   But I quibble.I was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter - rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a Porsche convertible and acting like a moron, Willis' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life.  His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and frankly, I didn't care).   Young Rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in divining the truth - he sums up Russell's job as an image consultant thusly, You teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't.    In order for a good script to succeed, however, you need actors to bring it to life.  Not a problem here.Although Willis has thrice ignored W.C. Fields' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again, meshing as well comedically with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous.  Breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood - the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on.   We also get two bonus performances Lily Tomlin is great as Russell's levelheaded assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman (I loved her in Guinevere).The Kid is charming, heavy, and real.  And it will appeal to adults of all ages.

After all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many options.  Bruce Willis however does a superb job in the role he was given.  I was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part.  This is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it I now agree.  This film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be, and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be.  This is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think.  Usually we scorn at What if... movies.  For example, Waterworld attempted to answer the question What if the world were to be covered with water and...?  But truthfully, nobody cared.  This movie however effects everyone in the theatre.  True, young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away, but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children.  This movie is definitely worth seeing.  Although, it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much (about how the kid got there, and why and all that stuff)  Just relax and have fun.  And take something with you when you leave that cinema.  Take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it.

This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids. I was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know Russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old.  Also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage. Good use of the red plane as metaphor, however.

I'm pretty sure I would never have taped it if I knew this was a Disney movie, fearing that all the syrupy nonsense would be too much for me to handle. Still, I don't know what made me decide to give this movie a try when I saw the title in the beginning of the movie, but in the end I was glad that I watched it, because it certainly wasn't as bad as I feared it would be.Bruce Willis is Russ Duritz, a wealthy L.A. image consultant who's about to turn forty. He's a cynical workaholic who has estranged from his father, who has no memories of his childhood and who doesn't have a girlfriend, a family or even a dog. One night he surprises an intruder, who turns out to be an almost 8 years old kid. But there is something strange about him. The chubby kid is named Rusty and has a lot of similarities with Russ. Soon they find out that Russ and Rusty are actually the same person. Together they make a journey into Russ's past to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. How this is possible, what it all has to mean and how it will affect both their futures will only be clear at the end of the movie.In a way this is a very typical and predictable Disney movie with it's rather innocent and naive look on life, but I guess it can be enjoyable for adults as well. It is all very recognizable and it is a nice fairy tale about losing touch with your inner child. It certainly isn't the best movie ever, but it is some decent and heart-warming family entertainment that offers some nice acting and a good story. I would say watch it with an open mind and you'll see it isn't as bad as you feared. I give it a 6/10.

I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it. His acclaim, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. It just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation-ally set, there is a problem, an intruder at his home, the alarm has been activated! Russell can't seem to figure out (for the moment) what is happening to him. It's different and yet it is somehow familiar. A small boy, who looks exactly like....-- him. As their lives run smack dab into each other, there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to him, You have unfinished business to take care of, now!Amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that he has seen and has in his life. She works with him, puts up with his 'ego' and yet, she is smitten with Russell. Very much so. With Rusty his past 'self' now in the picture and talking a mile a minute, singing too late at night, everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly! Willis is fun, egocentric and at times out of his head in this lovable Disney modern times classic 'The Kid' and to add his little heavy-duty side kick Spencer Breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational supporting character, as he is the heavy-weight champ, teaching 'little' Rusty how to box to defend himself against the bullies on the playground. All in all this is a real winner of a movie with even Lillie Tomlin as the secretary and aide to Russell. I originally saw this back in 2000' and then again years later, with equal enjoyment. This is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any Disney fan Recommended highly (*****) "},{"Title":"profound,amazing","Date":"13 July 2001","Score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  I have been always wondering Can one truly explain the meaning of life in less than two hours? And here I got the answer after watching this movie for 3 times. This is certainly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Disney tries to make the film in an interesting and lovely way so it can appeal to both the kids and the adults. But what lies behind the film by far beyond the comprehension of a normal kid. Here, let's first look at how other comments put it `The movie starts by completely neglecting even an attempt at explaining how 8-year-old Rusty shows up on 40-year-old Rusty's doorstep But this is not true. Actually the film made a hard work demonstrated how Russ (Willis) --a successful image consultant and a rich jerk was haunted by the hallucination of a flying plane which was actually the same kind of a model given to him by his father as a present. Here Audey Wells present all the viewers a question as a shrimp in the later plot suggested it you're having hallucination for a reason and you need to figure out what that reason is.But at that time, the film is not in a hurry to explain the reason. Later on Ross's hallucination got stronger and he even imagined a boy intruded into his house. Even more the hallucinated boy lead him to an old drome. From there Ross's dream or more accurately the psychiatric journey of exploring himself began. That exploration filled most of the film till the 8-year-old Rusty disappeared on the same drome (notice only at that time Russ's clothes changed back to the sleeping pajama). The main part of the film (that's what I called the exploration) centered on the questions that had puzzled Russ these days What's wrong with him? Why he always said somebody call the Ouaaaaaaaaambulance? Why he had a twitch? What happened from being little Rusty and becoming Russ? What will be supposed to do with the relation with Amy? And finally what he will be doing in the later time of his life? The film did an excellent job in explain all these questions. Evenmore it raised another question Is Russ really a loser? Here Jean Smart said something very inspiring I mean how many of us grow up to be astronauts or prima ballerina? We just all do the best we can. This film presented the normal theme of midyear crisis in a swift and clever way without lacking of provoking thought.The main character especially Bruce Willis and Jean Smart worked very well to helped achieve visual effect as well as the profound theme.Russ got the answer and know what to do next, what about us?

In the leading role is Bruce Willis, who in my opinion must be one of the most versatile actors around. He plays the part of the cynical jerk Russ very well ).For most of the movie you cannot help but to hate him as he constantly ridicules the weaknesses of the people around him, and love him as you somehow know that there's a tiny seed of kindness waiting to grow. Emily Mortimer is extremely lovable as Amy, who works for Russ. Her acting is good, and I have to admit that I had to succumb to her cuteness- and I doubt anyone could help but to cheer her on through the whole story, she's so good as Russ's employee, who would like to like him, but gets shoved off every time she tries to be nice.The story is fun and imaginative. Russ's eight-year-old self travels to the future to meet him as a thirty-nine year old. The young Russ doesn't think much of Russ's achievements (chickless, dogless...) while Russ doesn't want to remember that he was once an overweight, whiny loser.Don't write it off as just another family movie thinking that you'll be able to predict the  whole storyline. You won't. Sure, the guy gets the girl, and young Russ and old Russ grow to like each other and help each other out.But as you watch the final ten minutes of the movie, as things start to get wrapped up, you will suddenly sit erect, brain churning, and when you figure it all out, you lie back, try to keep back the wide grin that is forcing itself on your face, give up, and say Holy smokes!

Despite the marketing screwup and similarities to Big (Kid in a grownups body) I thoroughly enjoyed watching Bruce Willis Get a Clue.  It was good to see that David Addison from Moonlighting is alive and well and Willis can bring him out at will.

Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is days from his 40th birthday.  His life is hardly full of mirthful joy.  He is a dour, unhappy, impatient grouch who is brilliant at his work and alienates everyone he meets.  Suddenly an eight-year-old boy appears, who he realizes is himself as a child, a part of his life that he has effectively blocked from memory.  The interaction between him and his former self brings about an understanding of the forces that are affecting his life today and fosters a transformation to a happier Russ.The story touches on heavy, soul-searching ideas in a very lighthearted way, which makes Audrey Wells' (`The Truth About Cats and Dogs', `George of the Jungle') script innovative and fresh.  Its deeper implications are certainly far over the head of Disney age kids, but hit home with their parents.  However, there is enough childlike silliness to keep the kids entertained while their parents ponder the true meaning of the film.After his previous project, the heavy handed `Instinct', Director John Turteltaub shows amazing adaptive ability in being able to switch to a lighthearted comedy with equal effectiveness.  His direction of the actors is terrific, and he is able to create scenes that are appealing to children, but not so juvenile that it puts off the adults.  In addition, his 50's period schoolyard scenes are very accurate as to costumes, props and feel of the period.Bruce Willis shows his versatility, giving a terrific comedic performance, unafraid to scream and stomp around like a kid to achieve the proper effect.  Once again, he displays extraordinary chemistry with a child actor, making it seem more as if they are playing together than acting.  Spencer Breslin is cherubic and believable as the kid in his first feature film.  Lily Tomlin adds her wry comedy to the mix and is perfect as Russ's overwrought assistant.  Jean Smart also deserves special mention, giving a sensitive performance as the stranger on the plane who becomes Russ's confidant.This film has a lot to recommend it.  It is entertaining and funny and it has a deeper message ensconced within the childish mischief.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is an enjoyable film that isn't just for kids.

The only problem is that this film is put out by Disney Pictures.  Why is that a problem?  Well, most of the children won't understand on what is going on, they'll be amused by the kid.  But this is more of a movie for adults, the same way THE HAPPIEST MILLIONARE and THE BLACK HOLE were for adults.      Bruce Willis is Russell Morley Duritz, a well paid image consultant, who advices famous and wealthy faces to have a better image.  From the state governor to a shabby computer programmer, Russell gives out advices to almost everyone.  Which makes him cynical, cruel, and at times rude.  Which is why most people consider him a jerk.  His co-worker, and flirt, Amy (Emily Mortimer) at times enjoys being with him, and at other times, wants to stay away from him.  It isn't until that Russell gets a reality check and he meets Rusty (Spencer Breslin) who is actually Russell at age eight.  Everyone thinks that Russell is suffering a mental breakdown, his girlfriend, his personal assistant Janet (Lily Tomlin), and his psychartist. But Rusty is actually there to help Russell on what is wrong with him.      THE KID is a fairly enjoyable film.  There are some very funny scenes between Bruce Willis, Lily Tomlin, and young newcomer Spencer Breslin.  If anyone can work well with kids, it's Willis.  With MERCURY RISING, and THE SIXTH SENSE, Willis is pretty much a big kid himself (i.e. John McClain from the DIE HARD films).  Willis also doesn't chew up the scenes when he's with any child, he let's the child take most of the credit, which I find very generous.      The film is enjoyable, but I really wouldn't consider it a child's film.  It's hard to say on what is a good kids film this summer.  While THE KID is to complicated for children, while DINOSAUR and TITAN A.E. are a little too violent.  That leaves CHICKEN RUN, the perfect children's movie of the summer. But we're talking about THE KID here.      This film reminded me of a family version of FREQUENCY, and BACK TO THE FUTURE.  It is another one of the what if you could change the past type of films.  I'm just wondering if that is the reason on why it is the number one plot formula in Hollywood right now, with all of these stars getting divorced or arrested.  But it's fun, don't take any child under seven to it, they'll be squirming left and right.

You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits. Into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well..you know the rest. Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant.

Bruce Willis plays an image consultant who encounters an eight year old boy who is actually himself. This doesn't make any sense nor is an explanation given but he is shown how he has changed for the worst since childhood. The conclusion is handled rather half heatedly but director Jon Turteltaub gives the film its impact. He previously directed the charming romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping as well as the intriguing Phenomenon. Willis plays off the humour with a boyish quality becoming the strongest element of the film. His dealings with clients are somewhat cruel but he will learn where it all went wrong in its shady conclusion. Emily Mortimer as a co-worker is basically a romantic prop there to inform Willis that he is being a jerk but eventually fall for him. Lily Tomlin is a fine comic given a rather limited role as his secretary. Spencer Breslin plays the younger Willis in what can only be described as complete nonsense.

Disney's The Kid lands somewhere between Mercury Rising and The Sixth Sense. Obviously superior to the mediocre Mercury Rising, this routine but upscale time travel comedy falls far short of The Sixth Sense. Instead of Bruce bailing out his immature cohort, the juvenile pulls Bruce's chestnuts out of the fire. Comparatively, Kid and Sense both concerned supernatural phenomenon, but Kid lacks the suspense of Sense. Scenarist Audrey (Shall We Dance) Wells has contrived a tolerably entertaining but predictably sentimental yarn where a well-heeled bachelor businessman, about to turn forty, unexpectedly finds himself confronted by himself when he was age eight! Sound like a comic whirl on the Dennis Quaid & Jim Caviezel father-son thriller Frequency? Not only does Bruce-at-forty meet himself-at-eight, but he also later gets a glimpse of himself-at-sixty! Clearly, any movie where the hero collides with himself from the past as well as the future simultaneously has at least a modicum of potential. Sadly, however, The Kid suffers from an anemic, half-baked script that offers few revelations and fewer delights. Worse, The Kid degenerates into demographic Mickey Mouse ideology. In this world, according to Disney, a loser is any guy who neither has a wife nor a dog by age forty.Instinct director Jon Turteltaub uses the opening reels to establish the cold, abrasive, egotistical character of Russell Duritz (Bruce Willis), a fashion conscious Los Angeles 'image consultant' with all the compassion of a shark and the knack for keeping politicians and corporate fat cats from committing public relations suicide. When it comes to behaving a curmudgeon, Russell rivals the obnoxious Jack Nicholson character in James L. Brooks' As Good As It Gets. Russell cannot stand to hear anybody cry, and he considers his time so valuable that he rations it out to his clients.Russell's administrative Girl Friday, the tireless but under-appreciated Janet (Lily Tomlin) relays all his messages and runs his errands. Ostensibly, Janet serves as his umbilical cord with reality. The surprise is that anybody in their right mind would put up with his antagonistic personality. Loyally, Janet sticks with Russell through thick and thin. At one point, she finds herself compelled to lie for him, so that Russell can evade his estranged father, Sam Duritz (Daniel von Bargen of The General's Daughter), who only wants to invite him home for a long-overdue family supper. Once Turteltaub and Wells have delineated Russell's unpleasant character, they bring on eight-year old Rusty (Spencer Breslin) who turns Russell's life into chaos.Initially, Rusty materializes mysteriously at Russell's palatial house as an unwelcome anonymous munchkin with a late-model toy airplane, skirting Russell's sophisticated home security alarm system. Earlier, a red biplane buzzed Russell during rush hour traffic, and Rusty's red baseball jacket associates him with the aircraft. Eventually, the red model airplane toy comes to epitomize innocence lost, rather like the sled 'Rosebud' in Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane. When Rusty shows up the next time, Russell jumps into his Porsche and pursues the chubby cherub on a bike across L.A. into an airport. Following junior jumbo into an old-fashioned trailer diner, Russell discovers later that the diner was a figment of his imagination! Finally, Russell corners Rusty rather anti-climatically when the latter changes the TV channel at the former's mansion. Presumably, Rusty wanted to be caught, because earlier he propelled his obese butt into and out of a couple of cliffhanger situations with Russell at his heels. Alone together in Russell's house, they compare scars (one reminded me of the Nike check symbol) as well as personal idiosyncrasies and eventually they conclude that they are one in the same. What began as an episodic, down-to-earth character comedy rapidly takes a turn for the Twilight Zone that recalls another Turteltaub movie Phenomenon. Audrey Wells' amusing but sophomoric wish-fulfillment fantasy poses a number of questions that everybody has pondered. She appropriates eight-year Rusty as the mouthpiece to expose Russell's mid-life crisis. After he accepts who they are, Rusty takes a dim view of his adult accolades I'm forty. I'm not married. I don't fly jets and I don't have a dog? I grow up to be a loser! More than last year's split-personality masterpiece Fight Club, Kid conjures up schizophrenia of the worst sort. Whereas Fight Club's hero divested himself of the spoils of materialism, The Kid reforms its rude, arrogant bachelor hero so that he will wed, raise a family, and pass along the baton of life in the relay race of civilization. After all, the anal retentive Russell had committed the worst sin by refusing to renounce his selfishness and give something back to society.Clearly, the Disney propaganda machine is very apparent in Wells' homage to It's A Wonderful Life. Of course, there is a happy ending with several hard lessons before the triumph. Rusty takes older Russell on a trip back to the past and the pivotal event in high school that warped his life. Evidently, some school yard bullies beat the overweight Rusty up and threatened to ignite a bunch of firecracker tied to the next of a three-legged dog called Tripod (Victimizing a dog is the last straw in schmaltz!) If Rusty can vanquish the bullies, he can live the life that the sought in his dreams. Basically, Russell gets the chance to learn the same lesson at age eight that he learns at age forty so he can give his life a make-over.The first casualty in both Wells' saccharine script and Turteltaub's heavy-handed helming is subtlety. Admirably, Willis makes every effort to offset this offensive sugar-coating with his Scrooge-like performance. Ultimately, this hearken-to-your-inner-child, feel-good, yuppie pabulum falters because the comedy lacks hilarity and the messages about conforming to the ideals of consumer society are facile.

It's about facing the things we were always afraid of. Willis's character is successful in a financial way. He doesn't seem very happy, however. For whatever reason, he is suddenly thrown together with his younger self, an obnoxious but charming kid who is able to see his own weaknesses, and blames his adult self. It sounds terribly complex but we get the hang of it pretty quickly. There are a series of pivotal moments in life when things could go different ways and that's what the focus is. If we were given another opportunity, what would we do? Everyone must think this at some point. The byplay between Willis and his young companion goes from confrontational and whiny to precious and kind. It works pretty well. It was much better than I thought it would be.

It is a story for anybody of any age. The message that you can be what you want in life is very profound throughout the film. It illustrates to the audience how your life can turn out differently depending on the choices you make along the way. I also liked how the movie told us how life is a journey that can go in many directions. A person just has to make things happen and go for what makes them happy.The bond and relationship that forms between present day Willis and his kid self is very sweet and endearing. Willis learns to forgive and accept who he was as a kid in order to better understand who he is as an adult. He learns and grows throughout the film and reaches a point of happiness and satisfaction that leads him to realize his life is not so bad.I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a feel-good comedy that entertains and makes you think of life's possibilities.

A life without love worths nothing.This time, Jon tells us that we got a kid inside us.  Maybe we had something that we just want it be away from us and so try to escape it.   Like Russ, when he was young, his classmates looked down upon him.  He lost his dignity.   So he understood that and now felt relaxed.  Let bygones be bygones.  We must overcome the constraint and that can make us grow stronger.  Life is short but we should live it brightly.  That's a very impressive message brought by this film.Maybe it is too difficult for a kid to read, as most of the users here expressed.   Sometimes I think Disney would like to increase the range of audience.  Yes, their target goes to children but this one needs parents to guide them at the movies.   This kind of movie is good because adults may also find it interesting, without saying it just for fun (like  DINOSAUR this summer).Bruce is not the last action hero, he looks fantastic in family dramas (NORTH and THE SIXTH SENSE) or best-selling black comedy THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, but not as John in DIE HARD series.

Any movie that opens with a bright red Stearman biplane flying across the skies of L.A. has got me hooked from the get-go.This film is what makes Disney, Disney. Take one kid, one very confused adult, a little magic, a little mystery and mix them all together with a genuine wonder for what it is to be alive and you have The Kid.For those of us who are only young at heart it tackles the age old questions of How the heck did we get here? and is this all that there is to our lives? It does this, thankfully, without inspiring brooding or self pity.For the truly young, who won't be as quick to dismiss running into their older self someday as an impossibility, (Thank you very much, Mr Einstein!) there is the magic of the situation itself, the obligatory number of chase scenes and the wonder of it all.The cast is competent, even if no one member shines. This is not Oscar material here. And its not meant to be.  I believe that this is one of the movies strengths. You are not going to see the stars (or at least I wasn't) you are going to see the story.With that said, my only real criticism of the film concerns its cast. Bruce Willis as Russ Duritz is... stiff. I could never really connect with his portrayal of the character. All through the movie I kept thinking to myself, This is a Michael Keaton role. In movies from Mr Mom to Batman Mr Keaton has shown a talent for displaying the range of emotions and conflicting motivations needed to bring Russ Duritz to life. I got the feeling that Bruce Willis was just a little uncomfortable at not having a 9mm hand gun duct-taped to his back!Overall, Disney's The Kid is worth the price of admission.

He lives in a  million dollar designer home in what I suppose are the Hollywood Hills, he drives a Porsche roadster, he has no time for his Dad, his faithful secretary Janet (Lily Tomlin) runs interference for him at the office, and his winsome 30-ish assistant Amy (Emily Mortimer)  is in love with him but too often he's a jerk to her. Suddenly, one night, as if in a bad dream, appears as an intruder in his high security pad, himself as a pudgy little boy. Rusty, who is a few days shy of his eighth birthday, is appalled that Russell doesn't have a girlfriend or wife, doesn't have a dog, doesn't own a truck, isn't a pilot and has a nervous twitch. Almost eight year old Rusty is there to knock some insight into Russell about re-connecting with his childhood dreams, his inner child and his capacity for love.I laughed a little, and a few tears made their way down my cheeks. The movie tugged at my heartstrings, especially where Russell realizes that he has to change. I didn't keep looking at my watch.  I didn't mind the little kids making noise in the theatre. No arms were sliced off, as in Gladiator, and no heads were knocked off by cannonballs, as in The Patriot. In contrast to Me, Myself and Irene, there were no quips about whether the girlfriend swallows, no jokes about dildos and no mainstreaming of crude ghettospeak.Don't ridicule me, ok? I really do think the movie addresses real human issues, and has some substance. A whole lot more than Entrapment, which is just a caper flick that is about high-tech gizmos and Catherine Zeta Jones being gorgeous but keeping her shirt on.I know, I know. The Kid is Disney. Its Bruce Willis. I don't care. It actually does try to explore a real human situation Someone who is by all appearances a huge success, with a thriving business, a large income, a flashy sports car and a stunning house, but is isolated and unhappy, estranged from his family, estranged from his emotions, unable to connect with those who would love him.But its a cliche, you say? Another canned Hollywood movie, a deft exercise in commercial  kitsch, cuteness and emotional manipulation, tugging at the heartstrings, then warming the heart? I don't think so. But why should I care? I'm no movie snob. I'm willing to like a Bruce Willis flick, and say so. I went to the movie to be entertained, and to be moved, and there was enough verisimilitude - similarity to real life problems and real emotions - in Willis' situation and performance to make it satisfying.One more thing The Kis is not really a children's movie. Its a light fantasy, a sort of ET meets Big, in reverse, but basically for grown-ups who can appreciate the notion of having turned out in a disappointing way, in spite of worldly success. While it is not a serious heavy duty adult drama, little kids aged 5 through 11 are liable miss a lot of what goes on, and might even get restless. And therein lies an issue for another day It must be harder and harder to get teens to go to a kids movie (my 14-year old six-foot one son has seen Gone in Sixty Seconds three times, but wouldn't be caught dead at The Kid), and hard to get adults to take the little kids to a real little kids movie.

And the saddest part about it is if that's how we look at it then we've already lost.  By employing those safeguards against the past we are accepting that those events are what define our worth.  (spoiler)Only when Russ(Bruce Willis) stopped defining who he was by acting against who he used to be could he actually realize the root of the problem.  His own self worth.

The secretary sees him, so the boy is not a hallucination.  But introducing him to other people is a problem.  He convinces other people the boy is his nephew.  Rusty gets along well with Amy and hopes Amy and Russ will get married.  Russ and Rusty help to improve each other's lives, but there are stumbling blocks.Bruce Willis goes from a real jerk to warm and caring.  He shows quite a range.  The scenes with the boy are quite good, and there is a lot of good comedy as well as some sad moments.  One memorable performance comes from Jean Smart, as a Southern news reporter who Russ meets on an airplane and gives advice to.  The reporter gets a job in California and later gets a chance to show her appreciation for Russ' advice.I had a good time.  This is the type of movie I can enjoy.  It is a family movie, despite some mildly off-color humor and one reference to the possibility that Rusty might be Russ' illegitimate son.Possible Spoiler  Russ and Rusty are in a car going through a tunnel, and when they come out, it is 1968.  Rusty gets a chance to change history.  The scenes from 1968 include several possible red flags for parents, but these are not serious a three-legged dog is shown being mistreated, and Rusty's father is quite harsh with him in telling the boy his mother is dying (that might scare younger kids).Definite SPOILER  Russ and Rusty finally realize where the plane came from.  I'm not sure, but it looks as if the pilot is Russ many years in the future, and because Rusty changed history, Russ will eventually realize his dream of becoming a pilot.

Bruce Willis portrays Rusty, an unhappy image consultant, who blocks out his miserable existence by engrossing himself in his work and basically being a jerk to everyone he knows. Then one day he begins experiencing what he believes are hallucinations of a small, bothersome boy. He soon finds out, however, that these are not hallucinations at all, but rather his own eight year old self, inexplicably arriving to give Russell (Willis) the chance to reexamine and possibly change the events that turned him into such a sad and lonely being. This movie works, if not only for the perfect casting of Willis in this role, but for the delightful performance of Spencer Breslin as the young Rusty.

In this case, it is Bruce Willis who stars as the grumpy older adult who, through some kind of miraculous intervention, is able to finally come to terms with his inner child - thereby rescuing himself from the emptiness of his emotionally cold, tragically loveless adult life. Russell M. Duritz is a successful image consultant so traumatized by being a picked-upon, bullied `dweeb' in his childhood that he has managed to block out virtually every memory, pleasant or unpleasant, of his scarred boyhood.  In his current life, Russell attempts to compensate for all his previous `faults' by becoming a career-driven, hardnosed cynic who is unable to connect with other human beings on anything close to a meaningful level.  Then, right on the eve of his epochal 40th birthday, a strange supernatural phenomenon occurs  Russell is suddenly confronted by a mysterious, soon-to-be-8-year-old tyke who, it turns out, is actually Russell himself 32 years earlier.  As the relationship between Russell and Rusty deepens, the older Russell learns not only to reconnect with his own past, but to absorb all the lessons little Rusty has to offer &#150; lessons that he, big Russell, in his race to adulthood, managed to forget along the way.`The Kid,' despite the fact that it is based essentially on a one-joke premise, manages to remain fresh and entertaining for most of its running time thanks to a clever and witty script by Audrey Wells, breezy direction by Jon Turteltaub and, above all, first class performances by Bruce Willis and Spencer Breslin who, as Russell and Rusty, achieve a winning rapport in their many scenes together.  Happily, the filmmakers have, for the most part, resisted the temptation to over dramatize the fantasy elements of the scenario &#150; which could easily have led to a great deal of lowbrow slapstick antics &#150; preferring, instead, to let the scenes between the two main characters play themselves out with a quiet naturalness, thereby allowing us to penetrate to the basic human realities at the core.  Although the film does suffer a bit towards the end &#150; becoming a tad more sentimental than is perhaps warranted &#150; one appreciates the fact that the filmmakers have at least attempted to achieve something fairly profound with this lighthearted material.  Lily Tomlin, it should be noted, does a superb job as Russell's put-upon and harried assistant, who tries in vain to act as the voice of reason for her self-absorbed, conscienceless boss.`The Kid' is not a `great' comedy and it never really soars like some of the better family films of recent years (`Toy Story 2,' `Shrek'), but it does provide plenty of laughs, some stellar performances and even a few insightful observations about human nature along the way.  Whether you are a kid or not, you will probably enjoy this charming Disney treat.   "},{"Title":"Getting In Touch With Oneself Is the Tricky Part","Date":"3 September 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  	A significant emotional event can have a far-reaching and lasting effect on one's life, especially if the incident is allowed to go on unresolved.  Sometimes it becomes a matter of merely facing the issue-- whatever it is-- but more often it becomes a matter of figuring out what happened in the first place, which can be a bit harder, especially if a good number of years have passed having relegated that source of darkness in the soul to the subconscious.  And though getting in touch with oneself is often a conundrum of monumental proportions, it's a necessary step in order to allow, perhaps, that better person inside to emerge.  It's just such a situation that is explored in `The Kid,' a heartwarming film directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Bruce Willis as a successful but cynical businessman who has a lot to offer, if only he would give himself a chance; which is just what he gets through the magic of the cinema.	Coming upon his fortieth birthday, Russ Duritz (Willis) has built a successful career as an image consultant, but he's also built a wall around himself that keeps everybody out.  He's perceived as a rather hard, shallow person, and he's reached the point where he doesn't even know who he really is himself anymore.  Not that he thinks about it too often.  He's lived so long behind that hard, external facade that gets the job done that he doesn't seem to care.  But it's taken it's toll.  He rejects his apparently loving and caring father, for example, but doesn't understand why, nor does he ever stop to even consider why it is so; it's gone on for so long it's just the way it is.  End of story and move along.	Then out of the blue one night, an eight-year-old kid named Rusty (Spencer Breslin) shows up at his house.  Rusty is about to turn nine, doesn't know where he belongs and proceeds to turn Russ's world upside down.  Because Rusty knows things he can't possibly know.  Things that soon force Russ to take a step back and consider his life from a different perspective; things that open that channel that allows him to get in touch with himself at last, through Rusty-- a mere kid and a total stranger.  And as the story unfolds Russ discovers that Rusty is indeed a kid, but a total stranger?  Maybe not.  There's just something about Rusty that is too familiar, and the kid simply knows too much.	Turteltaub has taken a sensitive situation to which many will be able to relate, and examined it through the medium of fantasy/comedy/drama to deliver an affecting, touching resolution to a universal matter of the human heart.  In the same spirit of films like `It's A Wonderful Life,' `Mr. Destiny' and the more recent `The Family Man,' he has used poetic license to peel away layers of cynicism and repressed feelings to get to the heart of the humanity that lives within us all, and he has done it successfully and to great effect.  In a world of fast-food and instant gratification, the story of Russ and Rusty is not unique; and it just may be that a film like this can become the impetus for resolution and communication between estranged parties in some cases.  Which, of course, would make this film more than mere entertainment, and thereby demonstrate the true power of the medium.	As he proved with such films as `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable,' there is much more to Bruce Willis than the action-figures he has created so well in so many other films (John McClane in `Die Hard,' for example).  Here he shows that he can tread that fine line between comedy and drama and make it work very effectively, which is no small feat.  He convincingly sells the hard-guy Russ at the beginning of the film, then just as convincingly sells the gradual transition and acceptance of a man who has for too long lived with a deception that has served to fool even himself.  It's a solid, strong performance that makes Russ believable and allows the viewer to embrace the characters and the fantasy that is being played out, which ultimately is what makes the movie work.	Breslin, meanwhile, gives a natural performance that makes Rusty an endearing and credible character.  He's all boy and all kid, and because he's so real it is easy to empathize with him, which in turn opens that inner door to Russ, as well.  And he really clicks with Willis (who as an actor is very generous with Breslin, giving him his own space and moments), and their scenes become alternately hilarious and extremely moving. 	The supporting cast includes Emily Mortimer (Amy), Lily Tomlin (Janet), Chi McBride (Kenny), Jean Smart (Deirdre) and Dana Ivy (Dr. Alexander).  In today's world (or anytime, for that matter), it's a treat to run across a film like `The Kid,' because it's not only entertaining, but a reaffirmation of the good that resides within us all, hidden away in many cases as it may be.  Well crafted and acted, this is a positive, feel-good film that celebrates the best side of the human spirit and puts a smile on the face of humanity.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

His character has been inexplicably selected by the fates to be visited by HIMSELF, although an almost-8-year-old self (known as Rusty). Over the years, Russ's inner child has been squashed, and he's grown up to be a surly, humorless, and friendless image consultant (irony likely intended); his pudgy child-self reminds him of his past humiliations and geekiness, and much of the film is spent with him barking nastily at the boy for being... a kid. The movie is a tepid quest to find out why the Russ-boy is there.From a child filmgoer's perspective, this muddles through with a few amusing gags, but not enough of them to sustain my 7-year-old's attention for 1 hour and 40-plus minutes. The loss of the inner child theme is too esoteric to click with kids. From an adult's perspective, I was more preoccupied with who kept Bruce/Russ's glass mansion so clean. From the get-go, it's so yawningly obvious how the film will end, you're sure that there will be a bread-crumb trail of heartwarming revelations or clever, sweet comedy as the movie progresses; however, there is none.Russ is a bore. Without Bruce's yippy-yi-kayay bravado from his previous action films or his snappy, cynical dialogue from the olden days of Moonlighting, his Russ character is not compelling for viewers of any age. He's a middle-aged sourpuss who makes gobs of money and has a twitching eye, but is a loser to little Rusty (and filmgoers) because he doesn't have a wife, or a dog, or any dimension. Only Lily Tomlin's underrated performance as Russ's put-upon secretary makes this half-way watchable. But tell that to a 7-year-old squirming restlessly in his theater seat.

Although Breslin's attempts at mirroring Willis are very good for someone his age, and that also Willis is good too, these 2 things aren't enough for me to really like this film.

My opinion goes in two directions.The film The Kid, although it seems like a promising movie,has many unexplained parts.  The writer, to fix this, says in one sentence Older Bruce to Young Bruce I'm sure you have a lot of questions and just glides right past that part.  Much of the movie leaves you wondering, and you get no payoff at the end.  This gives the movie a 'hollow' feel.  If the writer hadn't been reaching for so much, she could have given us an explanation.For the good part of this film, it is a movie the whole family can relate to and enjoy.  It is a warm hearted film, and is very possible to like, or even love it.  Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance, and Spencer Breslin is quite perfect for the role of Willis as 8 years old.  Although unexplained, I find it impossible for anyone not to like this film.The storyline is easy to understand, although it hasn't been used hundreds of times.  The film starts off showing Russ' (Willis)life.  After a few minutes of this, Russ Durwitz finds himself, only at the age of 8.  Most of the movie is Russ (40) adjusting and getting know to Rusty, with a few subplots.  The storyline is catchy, but the film is too disjointed, and as said before, is too hollow.If you're looking for a film that the whole family can enjoy, and isn't thought-provoking, this film would fill your needs fully.

It is rare that one sees a movie give up so completely on a plot point. The movie does introduce a kind of ghost diner which may have something to do with this strange occurrance, but that idea never develops beyond the fact that the ghost diner appears and disappears at convenient moments. It would have been a good idea to at least show in a brief scene that the people in the diner are *all* people who are being shown the error of their lives one way or another, but the people we see are simply scenery.Not to get personal here, but the actor who plays 8-year-old Rusty isn't appealing. He is a kind of amiable slob. Doesn't seem to have any dreams beyond general kid dreams. It would have made more sense for little Rusty to at least display a little focus or obsession, to give us foreshadowing as to how 40-year-old Rusty got the way he is. Also, little Rusty didn't look the slightest like older Rusty, not even hair color.The female lead, the sort-of love interest, did a terrific job and was very appealing.The climactic scene, which revolved around little Rusty standing up to some bullies to protect a dog, never did explain why it was a turning point for Rusty. There were some vague inferences, but nothing that showed us that *this time* what he did made a difference. His dad yelled at him, but really, in that situation, dad would have yelled at Rusty eventually anyhow.Finally, the biggest conceit of The Kid is that tired, old Disney cliche, A person with a family is happier and better than a person without one. It seemed like the main goal here was to reform Rusty not so that he was a kinder, gentler person, but so he would get married and have kids and a dog. I guess if you don't get married and have kids you can't be a good person. I'm married and expect to have kids and even I am offended by this archaic notion.I gave The Kid a 5, and that might have been generous. Disney strikes again with another predictable, nonsensical movie that seems to exist only to support a timeworn Disney cliche. But hey, at least this time there were no cheap sidekicks.

The courage to risk feeling overwhelming pain, and the determination to stay with it until lasting transformation is effected.

There's a better movie, Kiki's Delivery Service, that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head.

This is definitely the overall theme of The Kid. Bruce Willis is at his likable best, Lily Tomlin gives a fine, understated performance, and Daniel Von Bargen as Willis' dad is just perfect.Russ (Willis) is to turn 40 in 2 days. He is a competent and wealthy image consultant who also happens to be a total jerk. Meets a lady on the plane, flying to Calif. for a new job as a TV anchorwoman, she asks for advice, he rattles it off, she says thanks, then he says with a smile, Now please lady, will you shut up? That is typical of his interactions with everyone, even his dad. When his dad had asked him to come home to visit and help move, Russ sends a check instead, his  rationale -- time is money, and my time is worth a lot more than it costs to pay a mover.Then, coming home, he glimpses a kid in a red jacket, who eludes him and slips away on his bike. Later, he finds a red toy biplane on his doorstep, Rusty written crudely underneath. Then the kid is in Russ' home. Turns out, they compare scars and birthmarks and somehow, this kid, Rusty, is Russ when he was 8 years old. He is chubby, meek, has a lisp, and eats all the wrong things. Rusty, going around the house observes, I can't believe I grew up alone, and there isn't even a dog in the house!So, why is this happening?  Russ figures it is so he can help the kid grow up properly. Russ teaches Rusty how to defend himself, and through the process of their getting to know each other, Russ eventually realizes he has let himself down, not growing into the person he had wanted to be as a kid.  Together, they begin to change adult Russ' outlook on life.Near the end, Russ and Rusty, 8 and 40, are eating in an old-style diner after they had passed through a tunnel which seemed to transport them to a different time.  A dog comes to their table, and its owner at the door calls to Chester, the dog, the name the kid had always planned to give his dog. They follow the fellow outside, and it turns out to be Russ around age 70, gray hair, mustache, now a pilot, they all three meet face to face.  Really a touching moment. Then Russ (70) flies away with dog and wife and obviously a great life.  Russ (40) and Rusty (8) are on the tarmac as the plane flys away, jumping and yelling, We did it, celebrating the life they now both know they will have.  There is one short following scene which shows Russ' changed interaction with his co-workers and family, and beginning to take a more relaxed approach to career.The written description, above, does in no way do justice to the fine writing, musical score, acting, and directing which make this one of the more enjoyable films I have seen.

From trailers and posters both films appeared to offer simplistic laughs through big comic stars like Billy Crystal and Eddie Murphy. The productions ended up as sentimental, heartfelt dramas with comic undertones to make them seem as if they are comedies. Movies have a difficult time blending emotional clichés and zany comedy together, and although those films induced audience participation, neither My Giant nor Holy Man worked on either level.Disney's The Kid does what My Giant and Holy Man did, except this movie does it in more of a clumsy, although sophisticated, method; it is heartwarming, gentle, touching, and in some aspects works enormously, but I am not sure how it flourishes on the level it does with such a disoriented, unexplained plot that provides us with more questions than answers. The film supplies important plot nuggets where necessary, even through the closing credits. Only audiences with a determined willing suspension of disbelief will buy into the plot. Disney's The Kid is also very engaging at certain points, clearly because of Jon Instinct Turteltaub's strong direction of a sloppy script by Audrey Wells.Bruce Willis stars as Russ Duritz, a self-centered but very successful image consultant who is single and not afraid to tell it like it is. Although rich, intelligent, and forceful, he has very little time to himself and lacks a life outside of business. His only friends are his secretary, Janet (Lily Tomlin), and his personal assistant and romantic interest, Amy (Emily Mortimer), who have grown accustomed to his lack of emotional depth.The movie has excellent character introduction and story development. We learn of Russ' character, how he is selfish, demeaning, and strictly business, not only through sharp dialogue, but also reinforcing actions and incidences. Side characters contribute to Russ' defining, although not necessarily defined themselves. Whereas we have seen this material before in movies like Scrooged and Groundhog Day, Bruce Willis furnishes a fresh, appealing touch of charisma. I probably would have casted a more obligatory actor for the role, like Bill Murray or Tom Hanks. Still, Willis does a fine job.Russ soon repeatedly encounters a young, clumsy, chubby eight-year-old boy named Rusty. It is not too long before forty-year-old Russ figures out Rusty is himself as a child. This kind of occurrence, much better portrayed in this year's earlier Frequency, can be believable, but the movie never actually explains why or how young Rusty returns to Russ like a ghost out of nowhere. The kid's presence obviously brings forth many conflicts and opportunities the two characters must work out together. Even if you were to just except the concept of Russ' returning childhood, the idea becomes lost within the film's own mushy romantic subplot, and by the end, the movie is stuck on resolving one specific event in Russ' history, an event complete pointless to the rest of the story.Apart from the many other flaws present in Disney's The Kid, perhaps the biggest and most destructive of them all is that the filmmakers are not sure what age group in which to identify. The silly comedy scenes, somewhat borrowed from movies like Big Daddy and Turner & Hooch, are squarely aimed at preteens. However, the story detailing an executive getting in touch with his inner child will certainly appeal to adults. I say this time and time again, material is more effective if played straight. One way or the other, Hollywood, one way or the other.

They figure it out.  They meet Willis when he's older.  Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with, how he got that knowledge to begin with, how he came to the realization that he needed to do this, and so on.Basically, it's a very tired, unoriginal, uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it.
