Other insects are not familiar ones you'd recognize, anyway. Some are really strange-looking.The colors, the wild shapes and actions of these creatures all make a for a fascinating movie in parts, one that literally all ages should enjoy, as the clich√© goes. I found, however, that with no dialog, it was tough to watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments. There is sound, however the sound these insects make.

It's a pity more attention was not given to the sound which comes and goes in an unpredictable fashion.  There is very little commentary so one must just accept the beauty of each particular shot.  One does not have to be a zoologist to enjoy this strange world the inhabiatnts of which outnumber humans on planet earth.There is some sound e.g. the flutter of wings and the buzzing of bees but much of the film is silent as one might expect in a world of insects. Music accompanies some of the scenes adding a degree of drama. Two slimy snails are seen touching and fondling each other indicating unmistakably that foreplay has begun and sexual union will follow as the choral music climaxes.  The photographers must have a rare patience to record such intimate and detailed incidents.The film is not without its humorous moments.

Take a meadow in France that appears to consist of nothing but grass, and show us what wonders there are to be seen if you lower your eyes and look at the very very small...Insects (and arachnids and teensy molluscs) offer a possible advantage over, say, lions; in that with insects, cinematography really comes into its own. If you want to show a lion catching an antelope then you have to point your camera at a likely spot and wait and wait and wait until the event occurs; and when it does, chances are that the lighting is at its worst, the background is less than ideal and you would have got a better view from somewhere else.  The world of the tiny gives the fellow with the camera much more control, much more room to manoeuvre.  It's much easier to hit upon the perfect angle from which to show the spider eating the grasshopper.  I don't know if this is true; but it's one possible explanation for why the shots are so gorgeous, and why we feel we were given the best possible seats.But if you find yourself asking, What the hell was going on? - well, you shouldn't have to ask.  You should have been told.  One of the reasons (I hope) for watching what is after all a documentary, is to find out WHAT GOES ON in an ordinary meadow; and if the producer thought that a human voice would destroy the sibylline loveliness of it all, that's just too bad - film-making isn't all pretty pictures.  If you don't want David Attenborough doing the talking (although frankly, I don't see why you wouldn't), then find someone else or some other style of narration; or, perhaps, take more care to arrange the images so that the images themselves tell the story. I'm sure it could have been done.  As it was I got the impression that we were shown ants getting hit by raindrops until they thought we must be tired of ants - and then we were shown something else.I don't want to carp too much.  The makers could well retort that books, rather than films, are ideally suited to explanation, and that they had simply made a film for us to watch AFTER we had read the relevant books. Perhaps they have a point.  At any rate, we may remain in the dark, but we have a wonderful view.

They select just the right music for a scene in which a pheasant who attacks and ant colony. Two snails seem locked in some time of embrace, a ladybug tries to take off but has a little trouble getting off the ground.'Microcosmos' fits the category of a documentary. But depending on how you take the behavior of these amazing creatures its a love story (two snails who seem deeply in love), a war movie (two beetles lock in moral struggle), a child-birth film (several insects giving birth), a disaster movie (a rainstorm in which the drops seem like a meteor storm) and a monster movie (a pheasant that attacks an ant colony). I sometimes felt like and interloper peering down into their lives in their most intimate moments.I saw a movie a few years back called 'The Scent of Green Papaya' which contained a scene of a curious little girl squatted down on the ground smiling as she watched a colony of ants at work.

The picture is superb, as it has to be.There is no plot to the story, and it doesn't attempt to encompass all of the miniature world of insects. It simply gives us, the viewers, a series of brief glimpses into their everyday world.We see ants busily moving a variety of grain into their tunnels. In a different clip we see a colorful bird, perhaps a Pheasant, busily pecking and eating ants who have no clue as to protection.We see a spider and its web, and how it uses the web to wrap up a small grasshopper that happens to jump into captivity.We see a mighty struggle, a battle, between two large beetles. And in another clip, a Dung Beetle working mightily to successfully roll its ball of dung to its burrow.Plus many, many more small critters.The image saved for last is an impressive one, we see what looks like a giant sea monster rising slowly out of the water, and when it is over we realize it is a mosquito emerging from its larval state and then flying away.A wonderful viewing experience for anyone who is at all fascinated by the miniature world around us.

Take away forty years of lens technology and you're left with Sloth vs. Jaguar, right? Well not quite - for one thing it's erotic, thanks in part but not entirely to the enhanced capacity for intimacy that those lenses provide. For another, it's got a bit of a structure, and it aims for mystery. Also, it confines the stupid voice-over to the bookends, not that I wouldn't rather that they dispatched it entirely, which goes double for the sporadic John Villiamsisms of the soundtrack. While I eventually stopped suspecting CGI, I do not doubt that some of it was staged, including one of my favourite scenes, the dung beetle rolling the dirt ball. Still, there's a lot of beauty in here, and even some small portion of the 'mystery' is justified by the content.

It focuses on the insects, not the surroundings and it sets the scene well. There isn't really a soundtrack but there is two pieces of commentary. The first is an opening description of the film, and the second is some closing poetic words. This was diagetic sound. The camera angles are used very effectively.

There is a delicacy of observation and subtlety of touch in this work which is a refreshment from the normal fact-deadened approach we're used to. Here, nature unfolds with exceptional beauty and we are allowed to use our own intelligence to appreciate the wonder for ourselves. This is an elegantly spiritual work which respects nature and the viewer.

It's a Comedy, Action, Romance, Adventure,Horror, Drama, Musical, and even has a little Porn thrown in forgood measure (insect and mollusc porn that is)!  Beautifully shotalmost completely in extreme close-ups, MicroCosmos takes usthrough a day in the life of the small inhabitants of an anywhere- on-Earth grassy meadow (although some of the film was clearlyshot in a studio environment).  This is one of the few films I can watch over and over again due tothe mesmerising nature of the subjects, whether they are insects,molluscs, arachnids, amphibians, birds, or even plant-life; everyaspect of their existence and interaction is utterly engrossing! (Punintended.) The cinematography is quite possibly the BEST I've everseen, and between 2 years of equipment design and 3 years ofshooting (not to mention 15 years of research!), I suppose thatperfection is the natural outcome.  One aspect I found deliciously refreshing is the lack of narration,and sometimes sparse musical soundtrack.  Whereas mostdocumentaries saturate the viewer with facts, names and nearstep-for-step action guides, this one just lets you WATCH; theresult being that you feel like that curious viewer in a meadow ofyour childhood once again.  Magic exists once again!  My onlyminor complaint is that I'd have liked it to have been longer.9/10.  Truly makes you marvel at the diversity and WONDER ofNature!

I wanted to know what that particular spider (or other creature) was called. I wanted to hear things like Lucky catch. Sometimes a spider will sit for days without a meal. (I don't really know if that's the case.) Little bits of information like that would have been welcome.But then I became absorbed and realized that it was enough just to observe and learn what was available visually. The use of music to tell the story was not perfect, but good enough. I apparently do not enjoy snail mating as much as the film-makers though, because they chose absolutely beautiful music and it went on entirely too long. Strange.Nevertheless, I did enjoy this one and I would watch it again. It turns out that when you know more about them and can see their beauty this tiny creatures don't seem so creepy any more.

I watched it on TV, was waiting for it for a week when they announced it. Somebody compared this work with David Attenborough's, but in this movie you won't learn much about the fascinating life of bugs. All you see is some beautiful images of nature, accompanied by nice music, and it becomes pretty boring after an hour. I think it could be compared with those whale songs recorded on audio CD, personally, I prefer real music. This is like watching a football match without the commentary. I don't know much about movie photography, techniques or editing, all I can say that it seems perfect to me. So if you want to learn more about nature, go with Attenborough, this is not what you are looking for. It is a bit unusual tough, it gives it that must see component).

Never before had I seen a documentary with such brilliance. The film makers use special lenses and cameras to bring up-close shots of insects and other tiny little creatures. The most memorable moments involve beautiful scenes involving ladybugs, caterpillars, and snails.There were a few things more that made this better than any documentary you will see on the Discovery Channel. First, a normal documentary on little creatures would show an abundance of spiders. This had one brief moment where a spider was catching grasshoppers. There was a second spider that somehow lived underwater(!) that they showed. That was an amazing moment. Second, a normal documentary would have an irritating narrator explaining everything under the sun to the audience. This one only has the narrator in the very beginning and the very end.I am a person who never watches a movie twice, but I was so moved by Microcosmos, that I did this time. Actually, I saw it in two consecutive days. It is definitely worth everyone's time. Zanatos' score ##### out of ##### (or a ten, on this page). Check it out.

The characters are very believable because they are real and bugs cannot act. There was special effects used such as speeding up time to make the bugs go faster, apart from that no other special effects were used. It is arty because it's got special effects that don't affect the story. The story showed bugs living there every day lives. I didn't really enjoy the film, especially as it was so long for a film with no narrative. The film is non-narrative cinema. The film hasn't got a soundtrack because all the way through it there is sounds like birds, water, etc. "},{"Title":"Bored at first.... but then...","Date":"27 February 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary","Review":" I watched it for 20 minutes then pressed eject because I was bored... then I came back and watched the rest of it. The year is now 2006 and this documentary was made in 1996. But watching the DVD looks like it was shot in high-def with the most modern camera. It's crystal clear. I would recommend this even though it starts out boring. There is very little narration, which is kind of nice. I laughed so hard in one scene... a dung-beatle is pushing his find along and it gets stuck. He finally figures out how to get it unstuck. There are so many interesting scenes. Another one shows a spider building a large bubble under-water by going to get air several times and bring more air to make the under-water bubble larger. Lots of interesting things just like that. It kind of makes insects look cute.

He lets our eyes peer into a fascinating world.  Our ears are another matter.  When an underwater spider grabs a bubble of air from above the surface, does it really make a popping sound?  I think not.I'm amazed in the contrast between what an audience demands visually in a movie and what it tolerates aurally, even in a documentary, which is supposedly about real life.  I once attended a lecture from David Attenborough who was promoting a documentary on plants.  He got rather melodramatic in answering a question about the sounds used in making his work.  Their creed seems to be if it's moving, some sort of sound has to accompany it.Explosions in space, bird songs from the wrong continent, squealing tires on dirt; common examples of glaring errors that viewers simply ignore because they are heard and not seen.

It was released in 1996 and non-narrative cinema.There is no plot synopsis as it's non-narrative cinema but it basically consists of close-ups of bugs. The film isn't adapted from fiction or drama it's purely based on an original idea.The characters are believable because there aren't any unreal bugs that appear. The cast can't be judged because no actors appear in at all in Microcosmos. The film is meant to come across as 'arty', and could to the right people but certainly not to me as i'm just not interested in watching bugs for hours.The theme of the film is bugs. Its made up of short clips, of mainly insects involved in everyday life. These clips are well developed and put together. These clips are shot in appropriate settings. The cinematography is effective and the film makes good use of shadow eg. When the caterpillar was the other side of a leaf you could see the shadow of it's body but when you actually saw it, it had spines coming out.The music used in the film is appropriate but isn't to my taste.Camera angles are used effectively, they mostly consist of close-ups. But different camera angles were used, looking up at a bird from and ants point of view made it look imposing.There are no special effects used.The film does contain shots of snails mating, which aren't really necessary.Overall i didn't enjoy Microcosmos because i'm not really into nature but if you were the right kind of person you could love this film.
