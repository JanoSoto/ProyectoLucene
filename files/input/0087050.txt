But all the more chilling was an unseen, Evil Force who a group of murderous children happily calls He Who Walks Behind The Rows (Rows, meaning rows of corn in a corn-field) The image you get of this He Who Walks Behind The Rows character is simply Satan with a new nick-name. And why old Lucifer has chosen to possess a billion ears of corn in Nebraska instead of the John Deere tractor sitting alongside of it is beyond me. Whatever the reason, the fact that he's somewhere within that cornfield gave me the chills throughout this film. More chills than watching these children go on a killing rampage throughout the small town. Anyone over the age of 17 was quickly laid to rest at the beginning of the film, and any kid about to turn 18 happily sacrificed themselves to He Who Walks Behind The Rows.The film stars Peter Horton and Linda (Terminator 1 and 2's) Hamilton. By accident, they enter this small town and become the towns only two grown-ups. Once spotted, they are quickly labeled Outlanders and are pursued throughout the remainder of the film until they are finally caught, bound and prepared for sacrifice.I love this film.

Isaac and Malachai are still creepy looking cats (both played effectively by John Franklin and Courtney Gains). The musical score with the children chanting is an eerie effect too. The caf√© scene and the accidental hit and run are the standouts of the movie, it's pretty grisly stuff. The rest is a bit mediocre. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are pretty good as the young couple trying to escape the murderous children. And an appearance by R.G. Armstrong is never a bad thing. The movie is a loose adaption of a Stephen King short story, but the sequels are just absolutely King rapes. So do not bother with those.

There is no sex or nudity in this film.  Even though the images are pretty graphic, if your older children are mature enough to handle a little fright, this should be okay for them.  Besides, since the children are the bad guys, your kids should be pretty happy!!My favorite actors in the film are the two star children (Joby and Sarah). They really make the film eerie with their innocence and sadness over losing their families.  Malachi would be the scariest character.  Even the way the other children in the movie gasp when they hear his name makes me shudder. I would not want to face him either!!  Another aspect that makes this film so scary is the music.  The director adds clips at just the right moments but doesn't forget to leave ample silence.  There is nothing greater to add to the suspense than a good dose of silent screen.  Then all your senses get a jolt at once when the big horror scene comes alive.The most suspenseful scene is when the boy stumbles out onto the highway clutching his sliced throat.

King's stories have had a large impact upon the horror genre, and many of them are very good stories in their own right also. However, when it comes to translating King's words onto the screen; many filmmakers have proved that they are not up to the task. I haven't read the book, 'Children of the Corn', but I'm sure it's better than this movie. While the film isn't especially bad; it's hardly a tour de-force of horror cinema either, and like many Stephen King films; this one could have been a hell of a lot better. Actually, this story isn't one of King's better efforts; it follows a small town whose children murder their parents on the instructions of a mysterious preacher; a little kid calling himself Isaac. The story picks up three years after this terrible event when a young couple drive into town for some reason. They find the village completely devoid of adults and it isn't long until they discover what's happened and seek to put an end to it! This film has missed several opportunities, the most glaring of which is the subterranean manifestation that dwells beneath the soil in the cornfields. We get several glimpses of this creature, but we never get to see it properly; and because of this, the monster is about as threatening as a bunch of little kids. Oh wait. Anyway, the film draws parallels with other evil kids films such as Village of the Damned in the way it plays out, but it never really gets out of first gear. While the atmosphere of the town is foreboding and well done on the whole, the plotting isn't very exciting and there's very few moments of real tension or suspense, which ensures the film isn't as engaging as it could have been. The cornfields and the corn that inhabits said field's makes for an unlikely horror prop, and some scenes within the fields are genuinely creepy. The kids themselves are rather well done also, with both of the main ones having good screen presence. If you were to pigeonhole King's films into 'good' and 'bad', this one would firmly be in the latter side. On it's own, however, it's not all that bad, and if you're a fan of King's work, you'll no doubt find something to like here. Or you might hate it for not living up to the book, one of the two.

This very atmospheric piece is a rather humble b-movie that boasts an unusual and interesting premise (thanks to a pretty good short story by Stephen King) and delivers some decent performances from its cast (which is rare with children in general). Although soft in its depiction of violence, the movie offers some creepy moments (especially in the still effective opening sequence). John Franklin, excellent as the child-preacher Isaac, makes for one odd and creepy looking kid and Courtney Gains inhabits his psychopathic Malachai character with obvious delight. The cornfields are beautifully shot and the overall is boosted by a pretty efficient score by Jonathan Ellias. And to top this all up, R.G. Armstrong makes here an appearance (albeit a too short one) as a recluse gas station owner. Don't be fooled though. The movie is far to be a masterpiece. At leading endlessly its main characters around cornfields and then through the deserted town (direct effect of superficially expanding a short story to feature film length), the movie ends up suffering from its slow pace (Things just aren't happening fast enough even says Horton at some point) with the characters taking what seems like an improbable amount of time to realise what is afoot. The danger of young and impressionable minds blindly following extremist religious leaders is certainly an interesting theme but is here barely tapped into. Finally the climatic sequence, with the manifestation of the collieflower looking He Who Walks Behind The Rows, is a bit of a let down to say the least. Those (not so minor) details however are not enough to warrant the bad press the movie gathered upon release (and Stephen King's severe criticisms). Children of the Corn is a well performed little soft core horror b-movie that surprisingly enough spawned a franchise and still provides eerie ambiance and creepiness that even, at times, make the few cheap scares work.

King's story offers a dreadful sense of growing unease and a truly horrific ending which is completely scrapped in the movie version.The good news about the film is that Linda Hamilton stars; if she has ever delivered a bad performance I have not seen it. She has a toughness and a vulnerability at the same time, and is an extremely likable actress. I just wish she made more movies; I remember seeing her many years ago as the violated wife in the harrowing telemovie 'Rape and Marriage The Rideout Case'. Hamilton made 'Children' shortly before playing tough heroine Sarah Connor in 'The Terminator', the role for which she is most famous.Burt (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton) arrive in the small town of Gatlin, Nebraska to find that a small group of mutinous children led by the Damien Thorn-like Isaac (John Franklin) have risen up and murdered nearly all the adults in their town. At the unhinged Isaac's behest, they worship He Who Walks Behind the Rows, and they are not above sacrificing the odd grown up to this mysterious figure.The shadowy presence of He Who Walks Behind the Rows pervades King's taut tale. In the story, Burt is killed by this thing a few hours after he finds his wife crucified, her eyes plucked out and the empty sockets filled with corn husks. It is an incredibly downbeat and horrible ending to a great story, and draws most of its strength and power from the fact that we do not ever really find out what exactly He Who Walks Behind the Rows is. Is it human? This clever method of suggesting rather than showing horror is discussed by King in his wonderful and nostalgic non-fiction book 'Danse Macabre'. He recalls always being disappointed when a monster was finally unveiled in a horror film. According to King, your imagination will always summon a beast much more frightening than something that a special makeup effects man has dreamt up. Unfortunately, the horror of He Who Walks Behind the Rows is totally diffused by this film. Instead of some terrifying presence, we get an awful electrical current, the product of some pretty shoddy early eighties special visual effects work.But the worst thing about this movie is the happy ending. As I wrote, King's ending is far better and a hell of a lot scarier. It would have been extremely powerful had Burt and Vicky met a grisly fate more faithful to King's original vision. These are likable characters; we do not want to see something bad befall them. So a downbeat ending would have been that much more effective. The loss of these characters would have been depressing and unsettling. Instead, what we end up with is a forgettable ending to a forgettable film. 'The Shawshank Redemption' this most certainly is not.

While driving through Nebraska en route to a new job, medico Burt (Peter Horton) and his wife Vicky (a PR-Terminator Linda Hamilton) nearly run over a mutilated boy who staggers from the cornfields. Seeking help, they enter the town of Gatlin, whose under-20 residents have butchered their parents per the decree of junior-grade holy roller Isaac (John Franklin), who preaches the word of a being called He Who Walks Behind the Rows. King's original story (from his 1978 collection Night Shift) was a lean and brutal melange of Southern-Gothic atmosphere and E.C. Comics-style gore, which script Greg Goldsmith effectively neutralizes by adding a youthful narrator (a grating Robbie Kiger) and putting an upbeat spin on the story's morbid conclusion. Fritz Kiersch's direction is TV-movie flat, with the sole inspired moment (hideous religious iconography glimpsed during a bloody service) delivered as a throwaway. Aside from Horton and Courtney Gains (as Isaac's hatchet man Malachai), the performances are dreadful, and the depiction of the Lovecraftian monster-god as a sort of giant gopher inspires more laughter than terror. Amazingly, the film spawned six sequels; Franklin (Cousin Itt in the Addams Family films) later appeared in and wrote 1999's Children of the Corn 666.

The movie lacked an explanation for anything that happened, and most of the events seemed to jump out of nowhere. The whole The one who walks behind the rows thing was an attempt to have some type of mystery and intrigue but in the end we find that it really makes no sense at all when some random monster just appears from no where, burrowing underneath the soil&#133; yeah that makes lots of sense? The worst part about this movie it that it really made no sense at all. It never explained anything that happened, like why Job and Sarah seemed to be immune to the thrall of the cult that Isaac so easily asserts upon the other children in the town. Also, why the town so swiftly became a mysterious and hidden down that yielded power so easily, such as from the old man at the gas station, in only a few days. The adults die and suddenly the town's off the maps and the sky seems to yield to the children's will, it all happens too fast and with no explanation as to how Isaac and Malachai attain their god-like status.This movie seems to be quite the cult classic, and must have done very well judging by the parade of sequels that followed in its outdated footsteps. It's really too bad, perhaps if this movie had never been created all the other terrible Sequels would not have been made either. My advice is to stay away from this movie, you'll expect too much due to its fame and come away disappointed and angry, mumbling something to yourself about the structure that plots are supposed to follow in movies. I wouldn't even suggest this movie for a laughable scary flick, I would instead shy away from it totally as it fails on both fronts, I guess the problem is it takes itself far too seriously in correspondence to its laughable plot and story and ends up really sucking.

In present day 1984, Newlyweds Burt & Vicky Stanton on their way to another town, where Burt (a doctor) has a new office waiting for him. They pass through Gatlin Nebraska, when they accidentally hit & kill a child standing in the middle of the road. Upon examining the child's corpse, Burt discovers that the child's throat had been slit & had not been killed with the car like they had feared, after the child had staggered out of the corn fields. Upon investigating the field, Burt finds a suitcase the child has been carrying. Putting the corpse in the trunk & the suitcase in back, they drive a little further & meet a gas attendant who tells them to stay away from Gatlin. Going against the old man's advice, they head into Gatlin & find the place deserted of any inhabitants & overrun by a murderous cult of weapon wielding children, who follow their evil leader ISAAC (JOHN FRANKLIN) & his right arm enforcer, the teenage MALACHAI (COURNTEY GAINS)! who claim to be worshipping a mysterious & powerful deity known only as He who walks behind the rows who dwells within the cornfields & who have slain all the adults in the town, as well as cutting off all communication to the outside world. When his wife is abducted, Burt sets out to rescue her & thinks the children are crazy, but quickly learns that the entity the claim to worship, is in fact very real! Things only get worse when Malachi takes full command of the children & overthrows Isaac's rule & plans on sacrificing both Burt & his wife Vicky & Issac, unless Burt can stop him. CHILDREN OF THE CORN was a short story, written in 1977 by horror author STEPHEN KING (Just fifteen pages) the story despite being a short, was rather creepy, dark, weird & eerie, a very scary tale with a pretty good twist for an ending. This adoption of King's film pretty much takes the basic concept & jettisoned everything else, the twist ending was dropped in favour of a more happier one, the bickering couple that Burt & his wife were written as was also dropped, the spooky explanations for why this was happening, what the sacrifices meant & creepiness of the supernatural deity, the issues touched upon such as patricide, paganism puritanism & clairvoyance are all gone & as a result, the children's motives are left somewhat in the dark. Regardless of these changes, the film is well directed by FRITZ KIERSCH who stages some pretty scary moments, my personal favourite being the scene where the child's corpse whom Vicky & Burt find on the road, leaps out at Vicky in an eerie dream sequence & is able to pull off several jump scares & also manages to keep a good firm grip on the suspense & tension. Despite the fact that many call this King's worst adoption, I strongly disagree, I wound up enjoying the film, it has lots of the good stuff in it & for the most part remains pretty entertaining, even after repeated viewings. In an odd ball kind of way, CHILDREN OF THE CORN could be looked at, as the horror genre's answer to LORD OF THE FLIES, what with the children left on their own & making their own laws & the acting was pretty decent. In short, CHILDREN OF THE CORN, is in my eyes one of the better adoptions of a STEPHEN KING short story. True it doesn't really follow the story right to the letter, but it remains a fairly decent horror outing nonetheless & better than many horror films of it's kind. & it's hard to believe that the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series began as a truly suspenseful & interesting horror tale, full of genuine suspense & tension, two things that were sadly to be crudely abandon more & more as each sequel went on. This is definitely (arguably) the best of the series. Definitely recommended to those haven't seen it. But question did the score have to be so similar to THE OMEN? A truly deplorable remake was made for SYFY TV in 2009 that was co-written by King himself & that was more faithful to King's novel (which tells me it should have turned out a lot better than it did) & was directed by the producer of this film, DONALD P.

Aside from a slightly electronic new wave 80s score provided by Jonathan Elias the film is also scored by a children's choir appropriate and both chilling in tandem with the events that occur onscreen and with the theme of the film. 	    Like in many horror films we begin in flashback to prior event that led to current unusual circumstances with voice over narration of Job who is the older brother of Sarah. Throughout the film these two are involved in simple activities which are banned under the rules but because of Sarah's gift they generally are allowed to do what they wish. What separates this film from most of the 80s is that it's not necessarily into gore. We get dead bodies and the after-affect of the massacres. The obsession of needing to see the blade or bullet whatever it may be pierce the skin is absolutely eliminated and the result is even more frightening. 	    Joseph, a child displeased with the ways Isaac has placed upon the town of Gatlin, tries to escape but he is caught. All we see when he dies is a few drops of blood falling on a suitcase he was going to take with him on the road. Film is a medium that is at times binding to the imagination. When any director, Fritz Kiersch, in this instance allows the audience allows us to imagine what may have been done to these people it deserves notice. Another example of this being the massacre three years prior that kicks off the film we hear a mother's death over the phone and see a father's blood splatter over a son's face. 	    A lot of what makes this film great is the mounting tension that is created when we see these two trying to get around this seemingly abandoned town. 	    One of the most effective techniques Kiersch used to heighten tension while the film was progressing was the use of shots from an anonymous yet subjective POV after we knew the children were already out to get them. There's a shot through broken glass that's been stained brown, a shot of someone peering over a garbage can, low-angle shots of the corn when Joseph's being chased. He also employed time to his advantage because the young couple does not enter the town of Gatlin where all the horrors will occur until the 39th minute of the film and even when there things creep along slowly. There is a great use of wide-angle shots throughout to demonstrate the emptiness of the town. 	     The audio and visual effects of this film are absolutely breathtaking. There's a great use of what appears to be time lapse footage coupled with the audio affect of gushing wind to signify the wrath of God. Near the conclusion of the film we hear the greatest demonic voices in the history of film (In my humble opinion). It's deep, raspy and frightening without going overboard. And just when we the most psychotic of all the town's children is going to walk away from this Isaac speaks to him in that voice and delivers a line that helps make that voice He wants you too, Malachi. He wants you too.  The escalating horror of the climax continues when there is a gorgeous fiery apparition in the sky and later an obviously processed flame beneath it which we assume is supernatural but to say more would be giving it away.   The end of Children of the Corn is wonderful the very last scene gives you a fright which is conceivable and doesn't seem fake at all and is probably due to some crafty editing. It takes away that artificial happy ending feeling. The happy ending in any horror movie is absolutely false because we know usually have been through a harrowing experience and it'll be hard for them to walk away smiling. Watch for the sound of the crickets and the return of a choir, this ending will run a chill through you all over again! 	    This film is also steeped in religious commentary. First, there is Horton and Hamilton in the car listening to a televangelist and mocking him and showing very good comedic interplay. They find a cross made of corn and Horton says in an offhand and stunned way Jesus Christ to which Hamilton responds Not in my book. We witness a mass of those who worship He Who Walks Behind the Rows and see the irony of their words screaming at us. All the names of the children in this town Isaac, Malachi, Job and Sarah are all biblical figures. These are the Children of God-fearing people who have twisted the scripture to suit the needs of a few sick souls who are power hungry those who stand against the clan generally have no chance. Vicky is kidnapped and hung from a cross made of corn, biblical passages are written in blood on church walls the same church where a desecrated portrait of Jesus hangs. There is but one point where the film climbs towards the didactic and even so it's but a moment and almost necessary because it shows how insane Malachi's followers have gone. 	    One other things that make this film is unique is that we get inside the cult and see the way Isaac and Malachi differ. In what makes horror films fun we get to side with one of them over the other because if we were involved with them in anyway he's the one we'd prefer. There is much infighting with these two and it adds to the tension and adds a wallop to the climax.

The kids kill all of the adults and live in the cornfield and so on. A couple show up and try to save the kids that are non believers. For a little bit, after maybe 15-20 minutes it gets a little slow but I live through it. Then it gets alittle more interesting with the whole religion thing.

Weird static ball things that crawl through the ground and explode the cross and whatnot&#x85; then kills the leader but brings him back all zombie looking. I don't know it just seemed like the writer just gave up and needed something to finish the story quick and threw in something dumb and crazy. It turned it from a unlikely but possible scary story to something dumb and supernatural. It would have worked with it being supernatural the whole time or not at all, don't just add it at the end, it seems lazy.****end spoilers****in the end i guess it is a new horror classic and probably has been quite influential to the genre, i just have a problem with how they ended it, which ruined the earlier parts i did like.I wouldn't really recommend this film to anyone unless you really enjoy horror films or have heard of it and you're curious.

Trying to push their arguments aside, they try to focus on being a couple. While driving through rural Nebraska the two run over a boy who's stumbling in the middle of the road. When Burt reaches him the med student finds that the boy's throat was already slashed when he stumbled into the road. Who is he? Where did he come from? The couple stops at a near by almost ghost-townish like gas station. The old man there tells them to turn back and go to the near-by town of Hemmingford. Discourged the couple decide to go to Gatlin, a town that is closer instead. What they find there is every parents worst nightmare!!! The towns children are a cult of murderous malcontents. Children who wield sickles, scythes, and machetes and chant, Spill the blood of the outlanders. The children are led by a boy preacher named Isaac Chorner and his henchman Malachai. And they worship an evil corn deity named He Who Walks Behind the Rows. These two characters (Isaac and Malachai) alone are enough to make your skin crawl! The machete twirling Malachai, and the Giver of his word Isaac will have you hiding your head under the covers. As for the rest of the story if you really want to know you'll have to watch the movie yourself. But to it's credibility this one movie has now spawned 6 sequels. Some good some not so swell.

First of all is the plot a very thin and pretty generic when you think of horror films. This makes the movie bad, because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN???!!! Thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. They are bad as they can be.The last thing that make this movie bad, is that its a horror movie. You are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not scared, you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen. Why? THEY SHOW YOU! yes, when something is going to happen BAM you see what it is and, well, see the murder. In the scene where they are escaping through the corn field, well, I thought in the beginning of the scene it was scary but the way they delivered the scare, ruined it! They have some chances to get scary but every time they are about to be scary, they deliver it pretty badly. This has to do with a bad director who apparently doesn't know HOW to make a movie about a cornfield scary. Conclusion The movie is bad! I hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary, the movie is best unseen.

One time while I was at the library I checked out a book of his called Night Shift. It is a collection of short stories, one of which is Children Of The Corn. When I read the short story, I was freaked out beyond belief, and strangely while I read it, I was in a car at night going down a road with corn fields on the side of the road. I quickly decided to rent the movie and I had my hopes up. When the movie started, I was disappointed by it. The direction is like something you would see in a TV movie, most of the performances are horrible, and the movie just doesn't deliver any scares at all. In real life this would have been the most terrifying thing ever, but due to certain faults, the movie just didn't work.(Spoilers) A bunch of kids in a rural Nebraska town kill the adults in their town and take over, forming their own little cult. A man and a woman who are driving through Nebraska just happen to go through the town. They accidentally run into a severely mutilated kid that was standing in the middle of the road. Mean while, the children of the corn try to kill the outlanders. The man goes through the empty town and tries to find somewhere to get help, but has no luck trying.Sounds pretty scary, but like I said before, the scares are never delivered the way they should have been.

I find that either people like this one or hate it. Some viewers despise the plot and say the setting is cheesy and the acting is bad, and that after watching it years later after we've all our bad tastes of horror flicks- let us not forget the Scream series- they find it is not as scary anymore. All I have to say is that if you're open-minded and you're into a plot about what would happen if these kids took over (sound familiar? sounds like my home town...) then definitely see it. I, personally, love this movie, although I started the second one and I couldn't finish it because I was laughing too hard. I'll try the third one, but really, the original horror movies are usually the best and in this case that is very true. On to the plot This is basically about two newcomers who come to this deserted town and find out that these children are actually killers and worship 'Thee Who Walks Behind the Rows', a demon in the corn fields that speaks to Issac only, the leader of the children. Of course, there's the rebellious Malachai who turns it all around for the children in the end, and then to make matters worse there are now two new adults things really get busy! I think this is the most appealing because you pretty much find out everything as the adults do, as opposed to the other movies where you pretty much expect just all these adult killings, although I've only seen the 6th one (which should be illegal in the US because it's so horrible). But anyway, a 7th Corn Movie is on its way, and it's on Post Production last time I checked, so maybe things have turned around! All I can see is that a new sequel is coming out every two years, but none will ever match up to this one. So see it! I give it an 8 out of 10! "},{"Title":"Children of the Corn shucks! This horror movie is too corny.","Date":"5 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Set in the fictitious rural town of Gatlin, Nebraska, the film tells the story of a couple, Burt Stanton (Peter Horton) & Vicky Baxter (Linda Hamilton), getting caught up in a ritually sacrifice murder plot run by the children of the town to ensure a successful corn harvest after years of droughts. This movie had a lot of potential of being a great corn in a cob movie about natural corn killers; instead, the movie fed its audience, chicken feed. What a huge disappointment! I was really looking forward to this movie as a kid. After all, I was a huge fan of 'the bad seed, horror genre'. 1956's Bad Seed, 1960's Village of the Damned, and 1993's The Good Son are some of my favorites. However, this movie really goes against the grain. It wasn't any fun of a great horror popcorn flick. Based upon the 1977 short story of the same name by fame horror author, Stephen King & directed by Fritz Kiersch, the movie was very lackluster. It didn't translate well into film. In my opinion, the awful screenplay is one of the reason, why this movie didn't work. King wrote the original draft of the screenplay, which focused more on the adult characters of Burt and Vicky and depicted more backstory on the uprising of the children in Gatlin; however, this script was disregarded in favor of George Goldsmith's screenplay, which featured more violence and a more conventional narrative structure. Because of this change, we don't see, how the children of this town, got tempt by this malevolent entity, that they call God, nor how they were able to maintained and keep themselves, isolated from the rest of the world. Here is a bigger question, what was the reason, they felt, the lone mechanic (R. G. Armstrong) around? I get that, maybe, they keep him around to help run the machines for the harvest, and help isolate themselves, from outside visitors, but it doesn't make sense in a plot sense, because, their God AKA 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows', stated out, that all adults in their town, must die, or he will lower the age to 18, rather than 19. Plus, he wasn't there in the original source material. The movie also starts off awkwardly, with all of the adult figures, being killed off. It's felt like we jump into the third act, without knowing it. In my opinion, I would rather have, the mystery of the child getting ran over, opening from the source material over this. It builds more suspense. Since the movie has large story gaps, it's not very well-paced. Lots of slow and dull moments. It was not flesh out enough. Another thing, I didn't like, about this movie is the main good child, Job (Robby Kiger). He reads the narrative, with seemingly no emotional reaction. A good example of this, is when he talks about his father being killed right in front of him. Also, for a character that is supposedly, very smart. He does a lot of stupid decisions, like shouting out, when people are able to escape. His sister, Sarah (Annie Marie McEvoy) is just as stroppy. She gives no emotional side of trauma, as well. Nor, does she ever seem to be in fear of her life. I also hate the fact, that her character started drawing pictures that predict the future, without any backstory. The two adult leads, are also pretty bland as well. Peter Horton looks and acts like director Michael Bay. His character has a very offensive and fake-looking attitude, when it comes to him looking for action. It's pretty lame, how easily, he can escape from these maniac teenagers. For Linda Hamilton, it's very jarring to see her, play the damsel in distress after last, seeing her, play a semi good heroic in 1984's Terminator. It's sad to see, that her character, here, doesn't really add, anything to the movie. Anyways, their action scenes, together, barely counts as thrilling. I really find the movie, very weird that it's Rated R, yet, most of the deaths, are not really gory, or graphic. The camera always seem to cut away. Another fault of the movie is the lame, and not frightful, jump scare. They mostly pointless, nor make any sense. A good example is the kid's dead body scene. It's a bit odd, for her to know, in detail, what the kid look like, when she didn't see the body, at all. Even, the anti-climactic ending was bad. The movie ends so abrupt. I would rather have, the tragic yet, somewhat bitter sweet ending of the book over this, any day. If there was anything scary about this movie, it wouldn't be the dated, special effects in this film as well. It wasn't impressive at the time, and it sure, hasn't aged well, since then. It looks like radioactive VHS static. The creature toward the end of the film, also looks like a recycle copy of the Master Control Program (MCP) character from 1982's computer fantasy, Tron. The only thing, that was somewhat good, about this film is how menacing, the then-25 year old, John Franklin as the cult lead, Isaac Chroner was. He really save the movie, with his chewing of the scenes. Courtney Gains as his second in command, Malachai Boardman, also deserves credit. He was foreboding, most of the film. Overall While, this movie was badly made. It did started a thread of sequels and remakes, hoping to capitalize on Stephen King's name. As of this writing, eight sequels have since been produced, and a 2009 remade, TV Movie was filmed. In the end, I felt like this movie could had been better. It's not the worst Stephen King movie, I ever saw, but it's not even, near the best. It's just disappointing. Not a-maize-ing. Let's hope, in the future, somebody can tackle, the source material in making a film with some respect.

One day a couple drive into the town, soon learning something is wrong, and it is up to them to stop the senseless sacrifices before they are slaughtered. Aided by two innocent children, they are up against the manic Malachai and some unseen horror known only as He Who Walks Behind The Rows...My expectations were low for this film after seeing so many other distinctly average offerings from the based on Stephen King catalogue of cinema. However I was pleasantly surprised by the film, it's not often that I find myself laughing out loud at a movie, but I just couldn't help myself in this case. It starts off well enough, as a spooky little atmospheric film, the most effective scenes where the helpless couple are driving around seemingly endless dirt tracks in the corn.However, as soon as the main male lead, played by Peter Norton, is stabbed in the chest (with seemingly no effect) things just go a little over-the-top and start to get funny. They then build up to the climax where I was pleased to see bad '80s animated special effects come into play. Well, some of them weren't that bad, but they weren't exactly VOLCANO-style computer generations. Maybe I am spoilt by SFX these days, but back projection is getting a little dated.The monster really remains unseen during the film, appearing underground in a TREMORS-style way, it tears up the ground as it speeds along. The acting was also good for a change. The children weren't too annoying, and I actually found myself liking the unaffected kid in the film. Malachai I recognised from somewhere, and the IMDb soon revealed to me that I also saw him in THE 'BURBS a while back. Isaac wasn't exactly what I'd call scary though.Peter Norton was quite good as the lead, he redeemed his nondescript acting at the start of the film by a speech where he shouted that religion not based on love is false! Linda Hamilton, in the same year she made THE TERMINATOR, sadly has little to do but run around and scream as the heroine. Come to think of it that's about all she did in THE TERMINATOR as well. At least her character was fleshed out a little there. The film remains unsettling at times, and is enhanced by the director's decision not to show some of the deaths, instead only hint at them (saying that, there is a meaty scene where an old guy gets his hand pushed into some sort of grinder). It wasn't overly gory but this added to it for me. The climax was fairly entertaining, but really a case of big explosions don't compensate for tying-up plot threads again. It's not a good film by any means, and it remains clich√©d, but I enjoyed it and that's what counts.

I have no idea how closely it sticks to the story since I never read it or any of King's work for that matter but the script is horrendously written with more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The only even remotely clever bits such as the depiction of the mob mentality engendered by cults are taken from either much better works or, unfortunately, real life incidents.The film takes a dash of Village of the Damned (1960) and a pinch of The Wicker Man (1973) to come up with a storyline concerning evil children who sacrifice people to ensure a good corn harvest. Now, I like corn as much as the next guy but this approach seems a little excessive to me. Isaac is basically an older version of Damien from The Omen (1976) crossed with Wesley Crusher and the film's score is a poor man's version of that film's. It's essentially a rehash of earlier horror classics. Unlike The Wicker Man, however, this film actually attempts to make the relevant crop frightening in a few scenes. Amazingly, it doesn't work very well. The director Fritz Kiersch is hardly Richard Attenborough or Kenneth Branagh but he's no Ed Wood or Tommy Wiseau either. Some shots are downright or at least borderline competent.The plot concerns the lovely little town of Gatlin, Nebraska which is ruled by Isaac and the other followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Three years earlier, Isaac, clearly a very persuasive guy, convinced the rest of the town's children to ritually murder their parents and every other adult in town (bar one mechanic). The town has been occupied only by the cultists since then and no one has noticed in the meantime. Isaac even used his powers of persuasion to convince cartographers to take Gatlin off the maps, apparently. John Franklin's performance as Isaac could not be described as good but, by God (or should I say by He Who Walks Behind the Rows?), it is entertaining. He steals all of his scenes and makes the film far more entertaining than it would been otherwise. My favourite line is Question not my judgement, Malachai. I am the giver of his word. His delivery and contemptuous expression are simply hilarious. It's a great verbal bitch-slap.Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play the hapless interlopers / outlanders Burt and Vicki who wind up in Gatlin while on the way to Seattle. Hamilton and Horton are actually good actors who deservedly went on to bigger and better things the Terminator franchise and Beauty and the Beast (1987) for her and thirtysomething for him. On the bright side, they keep the film from being even more terrible. On the less bright side, they keep the film from being even more unintentionally hilarious. The two of them have good chemistry even though their characters express little affection for each other until the end of the film. However, every time that Vicki yelled Burt!, I mentally added Ernie! The only other actor in the film who gives a genuinely decent performance is R.G. Armstrong as Diehl, the aforementioned mechanic. Courtney Gains, whose career peaked the next year with his one line role in Back to the Future, is awful as Isaac's disloyal second-in-command Malachai but he is not quite as hilariously awful as Franklin. But, hey, he at least put everything into it! The same is true of most of the other child actors, none of whom went on to great success. Incidentally, Back to the Future is my favourite film of all time. This film did not threaten that status.I mentioned a few of the plot holes already but this is one of the biggest. In the early part of the film, Burt and Vicki exhibit genius level intelligence when they run over a child named Joseph who turned out to be already dead, having had his throat slit. It just wasn't his day. They then decide that it is a good idea to bungle his corpse into the boot of their car and look for help. Right...Did it not occur to them that if they were stopped by the police and they found the body, it might look just a tad suspicious? No one with half a brain would believe that he had been killed by someone else and they were on their way to the authorities. Besides which, wrapping him in a blanket and shoving him into the boot would destroy any and all forensic evidence that may exist. He is never removed from the boot, meaning that he is left there to rot. Very conscientious! Another notable one is that the cultists kill Diehl, admittedly without Isaac's permission, for no reason whatsoever as he seems just as willing to abide by the condition that he tells no one of their existence as he was before. Furthermore, Job describes the brutal murder of his father which took place within several feet of him in a very calm fashion. One would think that this would traumatise a child but he and his sister Sarah take their parents' deaths and all the other horrific events in Gatlin in their stride. They actually giggle at the end, amused by the fact that Burt and Vicki kiss. Oh, and Sarah has the unexplained ability to predict the future through her drawings. Sure, why not? When He Who Walks Behind the Rows manifests, he is killed by a comparatively small explosion caused by a Molotov cocktail. One would also think that a demon from the fiery depths of Hell would be made of sterner stuff but apparently not.Overall, this is a great so bad, it's good film. It may not be down there with Plan 9 from Outer Space, Troll 2 or The Room but it's still pretty far down there.

I loved it. Now I've gone and watched it again as an adult - and with children of my own - it's a completely different experience! It's about a small American town in Nebraska where the children kill all the adults and start sacrificing each other to a mysterious god (did I mention it was based on a Stephen King book?). I used to love seeing the children attacking the adults (and no, I wasn't a hooligan, by the way). Now, I just wanted to send every last one of them up to bed and take away their portable DVD players (works every time with my daughter).It's certainly not the best adaptation of a Stephen King book, but it's certainly not the worst either. I guess there's a good half the film spent following the young couple of accidentally stumble across the deserted town, as they wander round trying to work out what we - the viewers - already know.However, what does make it pretty freaky is the lead (evil) children themselves. In recent Hollywood films, children have often been portrayed as the bad guys for added nastiness. Although, for example, just my making a kid's eyes glow red or have them dressed in ghostly clothes, doesn't necessarily make them scary. These kids are the real deal (and continue to freak the hell out of me without any false claws of glowing eyes whatsoever). All they needed was to be ugly enough! One has an extremely bad haircut (even for the eighties) and speaks like South Park's Eric Cartman. The other is like a young, ginger Mick Jagger. Even I would have my doubts about denying these two television privileges! Children of the Corn has sort of stood up to the test of time. If nothing else it's interesting to see Linda Hamilton in a completely different role to her most known part as Terminator's cyborg-killing Sarah Conner. I found the second half of the film more engaging than the first. My advice if you haven't seen this before and are watching it again for the nostalgia factor, know what you're getting. It's a bit cheesy in places, but still pretty good fun for a film that takes itself very seriously.

The film's main problem is that it's way too unbelievable to really register, the biggest of which is the fact that it deals with a cult that has acted independently in the town without discovery for three years. This suggests that every single adult who lived in town was related to every other adult who had no relatives that lived out of state. It would've been pretty suspicious when someone from town fails to take a relatives' phone calls, or the power company wouldn't think it kind of odd that every client in the entire town forgot to pay their electric bill all these years. We are further led to believe that the town drops off the face of the map with only one cop going in to investigate, and nobody followed up when they failed to report in. Furthermore, it rests solely on the underlying premise of finding little kids scary, which is the whole purpose for the majority of the chase scenes. For those that don't find this practice scary or chilling, there's little about the kids in here that changes your mind as all they seem to do is run and yell which can be done by just about anybody so it doesn't do anything special with the kids as the main target anyway. The other big flaw in this one is the fact that the opening to this is so incredibly dull and boring that it really takes a lot of effort to get interesting in what's going on in this and is incredibly boring to sit and wait for something to happen. That really makes for a troubling time as this one doesn't have anything worthwhile for a long period of time with this really getting interesting only in the final half. There's some incredibly tense chases through town as the kids pile on after the duo in all the different back-alleys and buildings, which are quite exciting for the most part. The big chase in here also leads to plenty of brawling amongst the two as he has to continually fight them off as the horde grows larger against him which adds to the action as well as giving it some additional suspense. The last good part to this is the finale which is highly exciting due to the rather frenetic paces, fully exciting moments and non-stop spectacle that's a lot better ending than a movie like this deserves. It's all part of what makes the final half so good though none of the segments makes up for it's flaws.Rated R Violence, Language and heavy themes of child violence.

I mean, I guess I was kind of foolish thinking I was going to get something halfway decent out of a Stephen King film adaptation that wasn't The Shining, but this...I mean, WOW. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Things like Birdemic Shock & Terror, The Room, and Sharknado are at least laughably bad, but this isn't even on that level. The only thing kind of enjoyable to watch in this film for me was that kid, Malachi. The way he screams OUTLANDURRRRRRRRRR with his mouth wide open is pretty damn funny. Even then, though, do I have as much fun watching him as I do watching, say, the outright horrendous special effects in Birdemic? Of course not. Other than that, there's really nothing to enjoy in this film. In the end, the couple just escapes, along with those two kids. What kind of ending is that?!? Now, I get that this probably happens in the book as well, but that's exactly my point why was it in the book in the first place? It's a horror story. I read it because I'm a blood-hungry psychopath, not because I want to see everything get resolved in the end! Now, they could make this work by making you care a little more about the couple so you'd want to see them live through this. (Keep in mind, I haven't read the original novel, so King could have executed this better there than they did here.) But they don't. All we know is that Blandon DeGeneric and his girlfriend are going to Nebraska for some unexplained reason, and they get caught up in this mess. They give us NO reason to care about these people, and half the time, in the scenes where you're supposed to be like, Oh, man, are they gonna make it through this???, you're just like, Uh...are they gonna make it through this? Meh. Let's see what happens, I guess. Not that I even give two shits. So, in summary, Children of the Corn is a terrible movie, and I suggest avoiding it at all costs if you're looking for a good Halloween experience. Just watch Night of the Living Dead.

Not erudite, but knows what boxes he has to tick, here a few of them all at once. Children as the source of an unfathomable evil so kid readers can shiver gleefully, their parents worry. The children have taken over a small town but instead of unbound freedom have instituted a religious tyranny that forbids playing and music, the same stuff adults are supposed to restrict. The town in the corn-fed middle of religious America so we can have the commentary.It's something King would write about and so the only difference from all his other similar fare is the application of cinematic craft. When Kubrick arranged sparsely we got a cavernous doom. Pet Sematary instead had a silly portal of blue light. Cujo was unambitiously effective.So this has the smalltown setting in its favor, empty streets and houses. It has the air of a sinister secret hanging above it that a couple driving through find themselves caught in and set out to explore. And the lush green fields with rows of corn swishing in the breeze provide endless opportunity for concealment and danger, ideal for horror.This is what you'll get, ordinarily atmospheric in spots, silly in others, but I miss here a cinematic eye invested in place and presence that makes evil surge through the walls. It's horror as comfortable genre rather than as a matter of hazard to the soul.

First, are the timeless classics. These are the movies that have stood the test of time as great cinema and will be loved by generation after generation. Moves like FRANKENSTEIN and PSYCHO were classics on their release and will remain classics for generations to come.Then, there is the second category. These are the the time and place movies. What I mean by that is that a particular viewer's devotion to the movie is probably based more on the time and place it was seen, rather than the intrinsic quality of the movie itself. I have rated this movie with a 9, which is much higher than the average IMDb rank and I would, firmly, admit that my own favoritism of this movie probably has a lot more to do with the time and place I saw it and the impact it had on me then.You see, I was 9 years old when this movie was released. I did not, of course, have the privilege of seeing it at the movie, but my parents did. I remember distinctly my parents talking with the family members they had seen the movie with about how scary it was to them. As a young kid, anything that scared your mom you assume has to be outright terrifying for you. It was probably around a year later that I did see the movie, thanks to the wonders of HBO and grandparents who would late me stay up late to watch pretty much anything I wanted. The movie did, indeed, scare the holy hell out of me.There are a number of things going for this movie that I still find effective now. The first is that score, consisting of a creepy child's choir singing songs that sounds like hymns to a pagan god. There is something inherently unsettling about that mixture of innocence and occultism, which is of course the main theme of this entire movie. Secondly, we have the background setting of the corn fields themselves. Having grown up near to similar fields myself, there was always something mildly disturbing about them. Maybe the limited visibility that provided such a ripe hiding place for murderers, or the strange sounds that always seemed to emanate from those fields (knowing as an adult, they were just birds and animals, but as a kid they were frightening).Of course, as I have mentioned one of the most disturbing things about this movie are the children themselves. The idea of innocent children becoming murderers has certainly been used in film before and will be used again and again because it is that antithesis of innocence and evil that is so effective. This is carried out even further here because of their religious devotion. The almost Amish costumes worn, the religious ceremonies and symbolism, the desecration of the Christian symbols, all of these things are used to excellent effect to create a nightmarish scenario for our heroes to be stuck in. Then, there's Malachai, he is such a relentless, cold killer. We are introduced to him early in the movie as he leads the children in slaughtering their parents at the local cafe, then we see just how malevolent he's become as he stalks a young boy trying to escape the town and murders him in the corn fields. He is as good a villain as any slasher film has because he conveys the same sense of unstoppable evil.As I stated early in the review, though, I also realize that there are things that don't hold up very well about this movie, at all, yet I tend to overlook them because I probably still see the movie the way I did as a 9-year old. The main adults make dumb decisions (as most horror characters do I guess). The movie tends to really drag out in the middle, an inevitable results in turning a short story in a feature film. The special effects in the climax are not very good at all. Not only are they very indicative of their time, but weren't that good for the time they were released, highlighting the low budget of the movie.I can understand why someone who viewed this for the first time today may not like it, but for the children of the 80s who grew up with this movie, I think a good deal of us still consider this to be a horror classic.

Next thing you know a couple is traveling and gets stranded in Gatlin, and their only hope is to stick with Sarah and Joel, a young sister and brother who don't like Issac's religious garbage or psychopathic ideas.Children of the Corn is a typical Stephen King film. As usual there's an aspect of religion gone wrong, a kid with a strange power (Sarah's premonitions), and of course, horror. All the acting was great, although the redhead buck-toothed teenager Malachai was incredibly hideous. The soundtrack was very creepy, a chorus of children that played throughout the film. The name sounded silly but the film was still very good.Children of the Corn is definitely worth viewing, it's funny and creepy and eerie all at the same time, and the ending, although very cheaply done, was suspenseful.

How I was allowed to watch such a movie back then I don't know. To be fair, maybe I wasn't allowed and I just found a way to watch it. One thing held true from when I watched it the first time until now I can't stand Malachai. In fact, Malachai ranks up there with Samara from the Ring as the creepy child that deserved to be erased from existence.Children of the Corn is a movie adaptation of the Stephen King short story of the same name. A band of kids lead by Isaac have killed all of the adults of Gatlin, Nebraska and live only to serve the one who walks behind the rows. After seeing this again I can see some parallels to The Village by M. Night Shayamalan.This was an eerie movie. It wasn't of the slasher type like Halloween or Friday the 13th but more of the scary religious cult type. I don't know where they found Isaac (John Franklin) or Malachai (Courtney Gains) but they were perfect for their roles. Isaac was spooky with an almost adult raspy voice that was still a bit whiny. Malachai was bafugly with his unattractiveness enhanced by his various scowls. They were two adolescents whom you'd figure to be part of a murderous cult.I see they've done a couple of remakes as well as some sequels; all which I haven't seen.

It mixes two popular horror sub-genres in religious horror and creepy killer kids. Although there have been numerous sequels, 7 to be exact. Nothing compares to the original in its iconic evil main characters Isaac and Malachi. It's a great story that really is pure evil.The story opens in the small Midwestern town of Gatlin, Nebraska in a little cafe where many of towns people gather. Little do they know that the children have planned a sort of reckoning and soon they will be left to fend for themselves. Their leader being the child preacher named Isaac. Isaac is probably about 12 or 13 and is short for his age. His voice is fairly high and has quite the violent temper. His second in command is the equally vicious red haired Malachi. They're a couple of little Christian fundamentalists that rule with an iron fist and warn to fear The one who walks behind the rows. They all congregate in the corn fields and listen to Isaac spew his sermons.Our adult hero's are Burt and Vicki (Linda Hamilton) who are traveling across the country back to Seattle when they accidentally hit a kid who ran out a corn field. They find that his throat was slit and stick his corpse in the trunk. Trying to find a phone (no cell phones it's1984) they run into one of the oldest horror clich√© know to man. The run down gas station in the middle of nowhere run by a crazy old man. The station's phone is not working and is also out of gas for that matter. They are told to avoid Gatlin and to go to the next town over for help. Although they do try to find the other town, it seems that all roads lead to Gatlin. When they arrive they find nothing but a ghost town and no working phones. They search a few houses and end up finding Sarah, a little girl drawing pictures. She has the power to see the future and her drawings are very important to the group. Her and her brother Gob are two kids who want to get away from Isaac and the cult but are too afraid to do anything about it. Vicki stays with the girl while Burt goes to look for others. The house is then attacked by Malachi and company, taking Vicki hostage.The plot is pretty simple but the characters are memorable. Some of the visual effects are pretty laughable, but it's still a scary film even by today's standards. Just like the classic films Village of the Dammed or The Lord of the Flies the children form their own society and things get pretty intense. However the Children of the Corn have a bunch of help from the devil himself or is it an angry God? The movie is currently available on Netflix watch instantly.

So I knew that it was about children killing adults, sort of a full length version of the end of Lindsay Anderson's If..., only without the machine guns. And with fewer public school kids. Set in Nebraska.Anyway, my expectations were duly met. Apart from the If... comparison. It really is not very much like If... at all. In fact there are definitely far more differences than similarities and I'm regretting this comparison a lot.Children of the Corn sees a good looking and paralysingly dull couple (one of whom happens to be Sarah Connor) caught up in the corn fields of Nebraska among youth with some unusual views. These views centre upon a real enthusiasm for human sacrifice to appease the gods of the corn. The lead boy, Isaac, possesses an alarming similarity to Paul Dano's preacher Eli from There Will Be Blood. Perhaps he's a direct descendant (presuming Eli had some kids before Daniel Day-Lewis bludgeoned him to death with a bowling pin).There are a couple of unanswered questions that I'd like Mr King to address. Firstly, why do the couple, after running over and killing a small child, put him in the boot of their car? This strikes me as an odd thing to do - surely an ambulance would have been more appropriate, or at least the back seat. But the boot? Dumping bodies in the boot (or trunk if you're American and have no idea what I'm talking about) seems like an activity reserved for serial killers and Mafiosos. Maybe it's a Nebraskan thing. The couple also seem remarkably sanguine about having a small dead boy in tow. If it were me, I think I'd be slightly more panicky. It doesn't help that the acting is about as dry as the dead corn blowing round the deserted town of Gatlin.It's not all bad. There are a few jumpy moments, and the soundtrack is genuinely creepy. But it falls short in almost every other area. It's not quite scary enough to succeed as a horror; not quite bad enough to be a cult classic (although it comes close, particularly some shocking special effects near the end). It is, at best, a mildly diverting hour and a half.

Be that as it may, there are some stories of King's that do translate very well to the cinema and despite what some might say, 1984's Children of the Corn is one of them. Based off of King's short story, it takes place in small town USA, Nebraska where the only thing people probably ever talk about is corn, what's going with so and so, and the weather. All that changes one Sunday morning when, in a particularly harrowing opening scene, all the town's adults are brutally killed by the town's children under the leadership of the mysterious Isaac (John Franklin) and his brutal lieutenant Malachi (Courtney Gains). From then on, the children are part of a bizarre cult that uses corn and human sacrifice as a way to worship some type of pagan god/demon known simply as He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Fast forward three years later and we find that a happy couple in the form of Burt (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton) are passing through the corn fields of Nebraska for what they think will be a normal trip to Burt's new job as a doctor when they seemly hit a young kid standing in the middle of the road. But Burt, through his medical training, knows that the kid was already dead with a cut throat and from there, they reach (that's right, you guessed it) the strange town where nobody seemly lives, except the children of the corn and brother and sister Job and Sara, who for some reason are allowed to remain outside the cult. Will any of them make it out alive? Even though this movie has been unfairly dragged through the mud over the years, the film is actually kind of creepy, with the seemly abandoned town covered with tons of corn stalks at every turn, decaying infrastructure, and Isaac. Played by John Franklin (who was actually 23 but with a dwarfism disease looks 12) Isaac is a spooky character, partly because of his creepy demeanor but also because of the fact that one can easily find people like him in real life in the form of such infamous men like Jim Jones or Charles Manson. Unlike those guys however, Isaac's cult has real magic behind it in the form of Behind the rows deity, who we never actually see but through some creative effects know very well that he is real! Courtney Gains should also be congratulated for his role of vicious right hand man Malachi who with his cold glare and big machete, would make anyone obey Isaac. And of course, who can forget his famous line OUTLANDER! We have your woman!. Peter Horton is good in the role of hero as is Linda Hamilton in the part of damsel in distress, almost right before she shot to fame through the sci-fi classic The Terminator of the same year. The movie does require one to suspend disbelief a little bit, such as why the hell don't Burt and Vicky get the hell out of town right away when they have the chance? But the movie is never dull and manages to keep you on the edge of your seat right until the climatic ending. It's a movie that will entertain you while harboring the hidden warning about false prophets and religious extremism under its surface. In case you're wondering, Stephen King was not a big fan of this film but don't forget that King also didn't like Kubrick's version of The Shining and that was a great, creepy film, was it not? While I can't speak for any of the sequels that came after this, check this one out and just to give you a fair warning, you may never look at a field of corn the same way again!

On the one hand, we have Carrie, Misery and The Shining; all great horror films that have become classics of the genre. Even recent adaptations of the Mist and 1408 have gained positive responses from critics and fans alike by obtaining the right mood and feel that the author intended.On the other end of the spectrum, there is the terrible film that is The Lawnmower Man. In King's defense, the story bears pretty much no recognition to the original tale and is essentially an adaptation in name only. Nonetheless, when watching a movie with King's name on it, one should expect it to be better then that garbage.Somewhere in the middle we have films that have gained mixed responses. Pet Sematary, for example, has a 50% fresh rate on Rottentomatoes.com from 18 reviews, with reviews ranging from Fred Topel calling it a Great Stephen King movie, to Gerry Shamray calling it Another awful Stephen King adaptation.Children of the Corn is another film that could fit into this middle ground, as it has even less critical acceptance at 36% on Rottentomatoes from 22 reviews. Despite this, it was a financial success, earning $14 million off a $300,000 budget and spawning 6 sequels and a telemovie remake. Granted, the majority of these sequels were direct to DVD, but it still shows that there is a loyal audience that existed for this series and enjoyed the films, regardless of the overall critical opinion. And let's face it, the critic's consensus never meant that much to most horror fans anyway.The story concerns a village that has been overtaken by children. The leader of these kids is a young boy named Isaac who acts as a religious leader towards the other children in the town. The boy claims to be able to communicate with an unknown force referred to as He Who Walks Behind The Rows. When a young married couple enters into the town (played by Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) Isaac begins to dictate to the others how The Man Behind The Rows wants the couple to be dealt with.The acting isn't too bad, Linda Hamilton, being the most famous person here does her job relatively well, but Peter Horn I thought could do with being a bit less of a doofus. Then again, maybe that was how the character was written. John Franklin as Isaac does a pretty good job, with a creepy way of delivering his lines. Courtney Gains as Malachai, his second in command, was a bit more annoying. The way he spoke reminded me of Al Gore in South Park through his irritating whining.But acting isn't what this movie is about. The movie is meant to be creepy mindless entertainment, and it does a pretty good job. Then again, perhaps I'm just a man of simple pleasures. Dressing children up in adults clothing and getting them to speak all spooky-like is already going to do a somewhat decent job of entertaining me. Getting them to act violently towards each other and I'm totally there. The Children of the Corn is not the greatest Stephen King adaptation, but it doesn't need to be. It's a movie that you can put on late at night and just enjoy it for what it is.

It turns out Gatlin has been taken over by a cult of religious fanatics operated by children. The doctor and his wife soon find themselves running for their lives, as they look for a way to escape Gatlin and The Children of the Corn This is an 80's horror classic, whether or not you want to admit it. Most of the hatred this film garners is because of the closing special effects. I understand why people hate the F/X in this film, but I don't quite agree when people flunk an entire 90 minute film because of two minutes of special effects tacked onto the very end. In defense of the film makers, the budget for Children was pitiful. On the other hand, the producers just should have tried ending this film in a more appropriate way, namely a way that didn't include God awful special effects.The rest of the film is fairly well done, considering the large number of child actors involved. The sound score is delightful 80's horror creep-ness, the location used for shooting is quintessential small town America, and the religious child sect is pulled off with panache and style that Satan himself would be proud to be a part of. This writer also personally feels as if the cinematography was above average, as was the directing; it couldn't have been easy working with all those children. This film just has a great atmospheric 80's small town, satanic, feel to it; and I love it. The satanic corn folk art is worth a view as well. There are some quality jump scares and some of the special effects nearer to the middle of the running time are actually pretty decent. Linda Hamilton is fun to watch in the role of Vicki and the characters that lead the child cult, Isaac and Malachai, are a blast to see in action. This is a low budget horror flick with some really original atmospheric components, that's all. For me, I'll take this film and it's shaky special effects over any modern day CGI slop fest.

But this is no peaceful kid commune -- Isaac is a preacher for He Who Walks Behind the Rows, a vengeful god who wishes death to all adults and those who wrong him.Stephen King's stories tend to get developed into fairly lackluster films. I could name a few, but I won't. Children of the Corn is a notable exception, being one of the staples of 1980s horror, and spawning numerous sequels. Featuring Linda Hamilton (before playing Sarah Connor in Terminator), this is a noteworthy story of evil children, in the vein of Who Can Kill a Child? and Village of the Damned. For truly, if children are innocent, how can one fight back against a bloodthirsty mob of toddlers? This film succeeds on the grounds of being an interesting story, without the need of gore or sex. In fact, despite multiple murders, the camera more often than not pans away or we are not treated to the actual vision of death. One of the most disturbing images -- a crucified police officer -- is still fairly mild and may even have a sense of black humor for the fans.The actors should be noted for creating a quality film. Aside from Hamilton and her co-star Peter Horton (who has long since been forgotten), the children deserve credit for giving mature and compelling performances. Isaac is a strong preacher, and the ginger kid Malachi is threatening. Sure, one looks like a young Patton Oswalt and the other should star in Pete and Pete, but we can excuse that. Even the girl who plays Sarah should be heralded for her shy and reserved display.Fans of 1980s horror really should have this in their collection, and now thanks to Anchor Bay, they can acquire a high quality Blu-Ray version with never before seen special features. Audio commentary, cast and crew interviews and more are on this disc. I cannot say how much the video quality has been touched up -- you can only do so much with an older film -- but the sound is booming quite literally -- the living room shook and kept me awake even though I watched in the late hours of the night. For those who have never seen it or those watching for the hundredth time, Children of the Corn is well worth owning.

It's not as funny as it sounds. This movie scared the hell out of me. This was the movie the turned me to the Stephen King Side of the Literary World. This movie had everything a horror should have and also a kid's best fantasy, aside from the whole killing your parents and slashing the entire town thing.The reason why this horror movie works is that it could happen. It's not so much jump out scary but more of the disturbing scary. Here are 12-year-olds and 9-year-olds all the way up to 17-year-olds killing their parents in the name of a false corn god. It could happen and there are religions that have brainwashed kids into murdering people in the name of their false god. Given the fact that this town is completely secluded from any major civilian population, that just adds to the sense of helplessness. You can't go anywhere because there is nothing for miles except corn.One of the other elements that make this horror seem more disturbing is the ritual and the ceremonies that these kids hold to praise He Who Walks Behind the Rows. The ceremony for The Man in Blue and the sacrificing ceremonies are all so crazy and weird. This movie hits so close to pseudo-Christianity it's scary. The casting and the acting are great. Courtney Gains who played Malachai did a great job playing the deranged teen that heavily believes in his false god. His catch phrase Outlanders! is classic. John Franklin who plays Isaac Chroner doesn't need to act, his character is elegant and quiet enough to where his looks puts the fear into you head.Overall, this movie is child's dream on ecstasy. If you enjoy disturbing horror and general weirdness, you'll like this movie. It gets gory pretty early and becomes hard to watch so I am warning you ahead of time.

The only thing that I found mediocre or disappointing were the production values. This movie, being one of the first evil kids flick that I've ever seen, had a sort of goosebumps feel to it, though it was still a few years behind that. Otherwise, it was just another 80s horror flick though the blood is minimal and the tits are absent. ( And being that this is a loose adaptation of King's short story, I never did waste my money on the sequels whatsoever. But a couple of things no one's mentioned 1.) This reminds me of an episode of the X-files called, Second Coming. I think they ripped off Children of the Corn directly because the parallels are obvious. 2.) Exactly what the hell kind of monster was, he who walks behind the rows, supposed to be in the first place? An overgrown worm that's been nuked by too much pesticide or what? 3.) And how come two kids resisted Isaac's mind poison w/out getting hurt or anything? I wonder if these people got back to Seattle and got a little unpleasant surprise w/ their new adoptees? I wouldn't doubt it. Otherwise, I think that about wraps it up for this one, y'all.

The film begins with a peaceful Sunday morning at a small-town coffee shop. Everyone has gotten out of church, and enjoying their breakfast and coffee. But wait! A group of creepy children approach the diner, and the waitress poisons the coffee. The kids storm in, slashing and hacking all the adults in the shop, leaving one small boy in the midst of bloody corpses. We then cut to present day, where a couple, Bert and Vicky (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) are driving through isolated Nebraska. While driving, a young boy (who was just attacked when trying to escape his town) runs into the road, clutching his throat. Bert slams on the brakes, but it's too late, and they hit the poor kid. He's obviously dead, so they put him in the trunk and after trying to find a larger city, they resort to the empty ghost town of Gatlin for help. Little do they know, there is a psychotic brainwashed cult of adult-hating children who worship he who walks behind the rows...I found the story for this film, based on King's short novel, to be actually pretty interesting. Corn fields are a little eerie to begin with, but they're even creepier when they're hiding a group of scythe-wielding little murderous kids who belong to a bizarre, adult-butchering cult. The opening scene of the film (the coffee shop massacre) is brilliant, and goes down on my list of classic horror scenes. The movie from there on is pretty atmospheric and eerie, initializing scenes of the child cult conducting numerous rituals and the innocent young couple having trouble in the isolated countryside. These scenes are spooky and atmospheric.The cinematography here is nice and the natural eeriness of corn fields is captured well, but a complaint would be the extremely fake-looking special effects displayed in the final act of the movie, they are really laughable, and the lack of scares this film delivers. It really could have been creepier, and I felt it was a little flat in that respect. Aside from that though, the movie was visually good. The acting is pretty decent, Barton and Hamilton both gave worthy performances, and John Franklin (who plays the leader of the cult, Isaac) is one creepy looking little guy (as he is conveyed in the movie at least). And there are plenty of gore scenes and neat little touches to the film that should please most horror fans.Overall, Children of the Corn is a decent movie. It's not perfect and surely has it's flaws, but all things considered, it's pretty entertaining and has some good things to offer for the genre. This film seems to have been getting some bad reviews, but I don't think it's all so bad. Definitely see it if you're a fan of Stephen King. 6/10.

The technique is absolutely flawed and proffessional dance instructors or choreographers with heart conditions should stay the hell away from this film. it's the kind of jiggle that could have never been fashionable. the kind that soccer moms purposely do in front of their kids to embarass them. and worst of all she sings along with the verses of a song that  the original writers of the song probably forgot years ago.i rented this flick because i saw the two subsequent parodies of it on south park and the simpsons in one week. i thought hey, this has gotta be a classic, right? south park AND the simpsons paid their respects to it. the rest is little more than memorable. most memorable are how creepy little isaac's voice is, which leaves you wondering if there are kids like that in real life and if you yourself could spawn something so ridiculous-sounding 2nd would be the sinister maliki whose appearance is straight out of deliverance. the casting director did an excellent job at finding the most alien-looking young folk out there.  3rd what parent in their right mind would let their children be in a movie where the majority of their screen time is dominated by their child running around with sharp objects in their hands?  and 4th is the already stated horrific linda-hamilton-beliaal-boogy scene.Sure the actual plot has some good ideas- the use of empty space. the suspense leading up to the entrance of gatlin. the lack of violent excess. taking something sacred (children) and turning into an object of fear, but it's really just not well-executed throughout the majority of the film. worse, the film seems to be preaching about religious fundamentalism. i liked the religious element, actually. i thought it was a strong point- but i don't like to be preached at.i mean, all in all children of the corn kept me entertained for however long it was and the acting was good enough (especially by child actors) to keep me concerned about the characters. so, hey it's worth a gander ...or maybe a glimpse. but i would hardly call it a classic.

The tension is built up nicely with our two main characters driving towards Gatlin, but things suddenly take a terrible turn for the worst when Vicky is kidnapped by Isaac and cronies. Burt's refuge in the kid's hide-out is very unbelievable....why did they not ever look in there ? - It would seem to be a prime hiding spot ?And the end......well, mighty confusing, disappointing and all-round timid considering it's supposed to be a horror film.It's not horrendous, it starts very well and does have it moments.

Obviously, there is not enough story to create such ventures. The filler they add tends to reduce rather than enhance the effect of his tales. Such is the case with Children of the corn. It's a bland often tedious tale of a couple who comes into contact of a wacko children's cult who worship a nameless demon that dwells in an isolated Nebraska corn field.The original king story was decent but far from his best. Personally, I would have rather seen some of his more interesting Nightshift tales like 'battleground', 'one for the road' or 'Strawberry Spring' brought to the screen. Here there simply was not enough material to put into a feature length film. What might have better would have been to combine two or three tales from his nightshift collection into one film. This formula worked nicely in cat's eye. Why not here????? If they had done this with goofy adaptations like 'Graveyard Shift', 'Maximun Overdrive' and 'Children of the corn' they might have come out somewhat more like king's interesting stories and less like garbage.

I would love to see this story adapted into an episode for a cable TV series, like Tales from the Crypt or something.  A half hour to hour long adaptation would be best suited for short stories such as this.  To make a feature length film from it lessens its impact (also see Graveyard Shift, The Mangler, and Maximum Overdrive to see other examples of bad feature-length films made from excellent King short stories).

This is quite a creepy film that is quite daring by giving away the whole plot right at the start by showing all the adults in a small religious town called Gatlin getting murdered one Sunday after church. This is quite a gory scene that manages to grab the attention of the viewer without making the rest of the film a waste of time. Children Of The Corn then manages an extremely promising and fairly gory opening half an hour as a young doctor and his girlfriend (parts well acted by Peter Horton and the very sexy Linda Hamilton) get lost and get closer and closer to wandering into Gatlin and finding the murderous cult of adolescents led by lunatic child preacher Isaac and his bloodthirsty sidekick Malachi. Sadly once the couple arrive in Gatlin the film seems to self destruct. The film begins to follow a very tired formula and becomes less and less convincing by the second as the film becomes little more than a series of unexciting chases up and down a town the size of your average back yard until the ending which sadly seems to  be little more than an excuse for some now fairly unimpressive special effects. The inconclusive ending will also infuriate viewers. Children Of The Corn is certainly not a bad little movie but then it isn't all that good either. The first half of the film is gripping and contains one truly heart stopping shock moment and is worth watching just for that, the second half of the film frankly is pretty poor and unsatisfying. Children Of The Corn is certainly fairly eerie but it sadly never even tries to be seriously scary. Taking into account the undeniably lurid and chilling central idea Children Of The Corn could have been an extremely disturbing film. Tragically it isn't but it still stylish and occassionally creepy enough to be worthy of attention. Beware of the awful sequels!

It's about a young couple who stumble into what looks like a ghost town in Nebraska. What they don't know (but soon find out) is that it's a town inhabited by murderous children who killed all the adults three years earlier, and any adults that find their way into this town are slaughtered on the spot by the evil kids. This is a ridiculous premise, to say the least, but there are some moments of sheer terror (especially the opening scene). Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton play the couple who make the big mistake of driving into this god-awful village. This is a movie that both Horton and Hamilton probably wish they never made. One excuse is that they were basically unknowns when they made this. But since this film they've gone on to bigger and better things. Horton starred on TV's Thirtysomething, and Hamilton's next movie was the original Terminator. Hamilton would later follow that up with the sequel T2, Dante's Peak, her own TV series Beauty and the Beast, and a husband in Terminator director James Cameron (they divorced shortly after Cameron's monster hit Titanic won 11 Oscars). Both actors rarely make an impression here, and neither does the young actors with play the children. Except for the two good children who befriend the couple. They're too cute. They should've had their own little movie to themselves.

Why am i interested in seeing what follows and what happens to these people? Why am i eager to root for the good guys?

Being stranded in a small town, run by psychotic children, where all adult have been killed, and isolated from populated areas by miles and miles of cornfields, is stuff nightmares are made of. There's no way to escape, you never know when one of the children has enough and decides to kill you, especially with the help of the others.Maybe the movie would have been better had there not been a monster in the fields. Children who are victims of mass hysteria, influenced by a religious fanatic, would be slightly more realistic and therefor much scarier.

Apparently it was the producer/screenplay writers's idea to use biblical names for the cult leaders rather than the more common names in King's original, good call. But unfortunately, that was the only positive contribution they made over King's original story. Actually, that's not true---they did manage to find the right person to compose the very creepy theme song, which has been in my head for the last hour as I've thought about this movie and review!!I was in the age range of some of the younger children in Isaac's group at the time this was released on TV, so it seemed much scarier back then compared to when I recently watched it for the first time in many years. My mum probably wouldn't have let me see such a movie in the theater at that age, even if I would have been allowed in! I had the same immediate reaction to the movie as an adult----Malachi makes the movie! He is the one that gives true menace to the scenes. He was dangerous enough to keep all of the children in line, but not quite enough to easily challenge the adult hero of the movie (Peter Horton), so not knowing if the hero can overcome him or not creates tension, because there is no one else that appears to have a chance of saving the day.All of the elements for a true classic are in place, and it could have made it to that level if not for the weak ending. There was really no need to attempt to give a face to the evil force worshiped by the children at the end, it would have been better implied (and no, CGI wouldn't have helped, either). To add insult to injury, after all the danger is over, the last seconds of the film are an unnecessary, dopey feel-good segment, which takes away from the dread that hung over the entire film to that point.

Linda Hamilton's great to watch, and John Franklin and Courtney gains creep you out like they're supposed to. The opening massacre in the coffee shop of all adults carried out by children is possibly the most disturbing of all. The first two acts of the film, in spite of the daftness, keep you with it.But in the third act of the move, this is where things start to get a little messy, and its high concept deviates into silly religious hokum. The plot deviates greatly from its source material, the original short story by Stephen King, and the movie ends with what seems to be a hastily thrown together action-sequence, where our heroes battle 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows', the demon that inspired the children to slaughter their parents. Complete with very questionable special effects, poor dialogue and nonsensical biblical passages, it brings what has been a fairly fun and chilling ride to a less than interesting conclusion.This is the best one of the lot. Just give it a go, laugh at its badness, and call it a night.

It can also be as low as an elephant's toe.Although it is pretty easy to argue that Children of the Corn is low (what with it being unscary, unholy and epically unintelligent) it is not necessarily unwatchable. This is one of those B-grade features that gets away with being 'amusing' if nothing else. The town of Gatlin, Nebraska is over run by religiously psychotic children, who kill anyone who enters town. They have been doing this for the last three years, since that one day when they killed all their parents. Three years later, at the (literal) height of the corn season, Dr. Burt and his girl Vicky are lost on the Nebraska highway trying to their destination. After a couple of bizarre encounters, they end up in Gatlin, and they are about to learn its deadly secrets.As is the case with much of King's work, This story is extremely subversive toward the church, which affects the screenplay a bit by making some of the dialogue very hokey. Rather than getting annoyed however, I was kind of able to laugh at it (not out loud of course). Children of the Corn, actually got me to care a bit for (some) of the people. Burt and Vicky are nice, quirky folks, not the kind of people you wanna see get bumped off. About 90% of horror films make protagonists out of idiotic teens or post teens. This was especially true during the eighties with the rise of such works as Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, (plus their sequels). If I had to guess what most people have against Children of the Corn, in addition to it's anti- Christian stupidity, it would be the film's lack of atmospheric subtlety. Children of the Corn sometimes feels like it came out of the 1950's back when large chase scenes were supposed to be scary and the presence of evil came with a blare of music. (here it is a children's choir). There is nothing particularly scary about the kids, once we see them (and we see them almost right away). They are just kids with sickles and knives, and their strength in numbers doesn't necessarily make them any more intimidating. Well, you can love it or you can hate it, but you won't know until you try. I'm not necessarily suggesting that you do. It almost impossible not to find this stupid, but it is watchable stupidity.

Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. A lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare.The cast are reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack by Jonathan Elias is spookier than the pictures.A real shame that George Goldsmith's screenplay turned Stephen King's haunting short story into a shocking horror.

Here it's nothing but corn and when Peter Horton thinks he's hit a child on the road he goes for help and there's none. The town has been taken over by the devil himself working his evil through a young child preacher played by John Franklin. All the adults have been killed and the children are his disciples.Of course some of the older ones are reaching puberty and the guy who was the high school bully Courtney Gains chafes under Franklin's leadership.

Very little is seen, much is implied, allowing the audience to imagine the horror themselves, which is much scarier! It starts slowly, building tension, in the same way as in 'Jaws', with it's music and underwater shots of swimmers and long distance shots of that fin. 'Children of the Corn' allows the suspense to build slowly, so that the audience are left cringing and shouting out warnings to the characters.This is a movie that gets it's power from the psychological terror, and the stark contrast in it's plot Children who kill.It's well acted, with the main cast turning in great performances. You truly can believe that these are killer children, that these really are two strangers caught up in this hellish situation. It's also Linda Hamilton's first starring role, and she shows why she deserved to be in The Terminator! An eerie soundtrack, slow and gentle, sung in the delicate voices of a children's choir, adds to the tension, and underlines the eery macabre of scythe wielding 10 year olds.For horror fans, this is a must see movie. One of the first 'psychological' horror movies, well made, and the first to give us the innocence-evil theme, this movie is the foundation of the modern horror and slasher genres.For non horror fans, this is still an enjoyable and scary movie. With little gore and few of the clich√©'s that riddle the genre, this is an intelligent and intense thriller of a movie.

There is a decidedly grim opening in which the children of the town kill all the adults, and a scene where one of the kids tries to escape through the corn fields only to have his throat cut up, but pretty much from then on in (20 mins and onwards) the film goes from being dull, to boring, to stupid, to laughable and then starts all over again.

The film is based on a 30 page short story King published in his 'Night Shift' anthology. The story revolves around the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, where the children have formed a cult worshiping a deity who lives among the cornfields. As a result, the children have all been driven to murder every adult in town at the whim of Isaac (John Franklin), the leader of the children and the one who acts as a prophet for the corn-god. Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play a couple who stumble across the desolate, cursed town.The story itself plays out nicely, but since it is adapted from a mere 30 pages, George Goldsmith must have had his hands full drawing it out to last 90 minutes. It does tend to slow down a bit in the first and second acts and I was left wishing something would happen to advance the story. There's a long period where we follow Burton (Horton) and Vicky (Hamilton) as they wander around searching for a phone. Once the third act kicks in, the pace quickens and I was drawn back into the story.Surprisingly enough, for a movie where the bulk of the cast is child actors, the performances weren't that bad. It's not often that I see decent acting out of children (I still resent Jake Lloyd for his performance as Anakin Skywalker). John Franklin did a great job as the demented corn-god prophet, giving a stern performance without going too over-the-top. Courtney Gains seemed to ham it up a bit as Malachai, Isaac's enforcer, but it was never annoying. For some reason, the kid kind of reminded me of Hugo Weaving at some points...The real weak spot for the film is it's CGI. Keep in mind, the film only had a 3 million dollar budget. So, while the CGI seemed weak (even by 1984 standards), it was the best they could do on their budget. The corn-god's final wrath-fest looked like something out of an OLD arcade game and weakened the overall effect of it all. It's hard to feel tension with graphics like that portraying this powerful being.The movie does suffer a bit in pace and appearance but it still makes for an overall decent movie. Hamilton and Horton turn in good enough performances and the kids do a fantastic job. While it doesn't seem all that scary to modern crowds, I'm sure it was a great thriller in its time and it's worth a viewing.

The couple stops and sees what they can do, realize the child is dead, and look for help. Eventually they realize the nearby town is completely void of any adult population. Strange corn crucifixes and husks of corn are all over the place. Then things get ugly... I liked the concept behind the film of the kids having taken control, but I had major problems with its execution. The hokey explanation at the end just does not satisfy me. Why was Issac the way he was? By the way the kid with the adult-like face playing Issac was indeed creepy. The kid playing Malachai was more annoyingly inept rather than creepy. How did the kid with the suitcase in the beginning, after having his throat sliced, manage to walk and STAND in the middle of the highway just as the car was careening down the road? I have many other like questions. This film for its time has some violent scenes. Perhaps the most violent is the first scene in the flashback of what happened three years ago at the very beginning of the film. In that scene an adult helps the children with their mission...what happens to her later? The empty streets of Gatlin, Nebraska are effective in creating much of the mood in this film. Actors Peter Horton and lovely Linda Hamilton as the couple do a competent job, and Robby Kiger as a good kid named Job excels, but the plot for this film is just too ridiculous. We see the sky inexplicably darken and wind manifest itself. We get no explanation really for anything. I am amazed that something so superficially bald in storyline has fostered at least two theatrically released sequels and at least four video sequels. (Now, that is AMAZING!) For me the best part of the film is the interesting, eerie score by Jonathn Elias.

Let's focus on the good things first.A young couple travels across the U.S. Suddenly, they hit what looks like a boy. When they return and examine the kid, they discover that the kid was murdered in the corn fields. They take the kid to the nearest town, Gatlin, where they discover that something has gone horribly wrong ads they found that the adults have disappeared, and the children act really strange.No doubt it's a good premise, having children as the evil was done previously in Village of the Damned, but here it's to the next level by having the children killing the adults following the orders of a bizarre religious preacher. It's like Village of the Damned meets The Wicker Man.Sadly, the movie never turns that good. The good parts are, the amazing score used in the movie, it's very haunting and eerie. It goes well with the subject and the atmosphere of the town. That is something which also deserves recognition. The choosing of the location was excellent and the crew knew how to give the town the atmosphere of isolation and mystery the film demanded. Too bad the director could not manage the actors as good as he did with the crew.The acting for the most part is bad; although John Franklin, in the character of the creepy preacher Isaac deserves credit for giving the best acting in the movie. And maybe of the entire series.For the most part the movie is average, but in the ending it falls apart when it breaks the atmospheric tone it was using and goes for an ending that the low-budget SFX could not afford.To summarize, it's a movie that will give you entertainment if you don't expect too much, and the great score and the acting of John Franklin may worth the rent.6/10 "},{"Title":"Question the Hound not, Malachai!

How on Earth did this little 3 million dollar monstrosity generate so many sequels? Our story centers around a young couple (Horton & Hamilton) who stumble across a rural town where children have taken over and killed off all the adults. The children are led by a self-styled boy preacher named Isaac, who ordered all adults to be killed three years earlier. The children practice some strange new religion that has something to do with a demonic being who lurks out in the nearby cornfields. Once a child reaches their 18th birthday, they are sacrificed to this god known as he who walks behind the rows. It's up to this young couple to break the young preacher's spell and fight off his top assassin known as Malachai.After a very creepy and effective beginning in which we see a caf√© of adults butchered and poisoned by some of the kids, the film quickly gets mired in poor pacing, wooden acting, and terrible effects. The film is talky, and the technical goofs are easy to spot. The film is so poorly paced, that it's hard to distinguish an actual climax toward the end. A poorly filmed explosion in a cornfield is all we get. With a budget so small, the filmmakers would have been better served to create some type of final battle between only the human characters. Those effects really looked terrible.I would have also liked to learn more about the religion these kids practiced. There are some Satanic-looking images, defamation of Christian paintings, and corn husks strewn all over the place. But we the audience are left to guess as to what exactly that thing is out in the cornfield.Though it takes place in our beloved state of Nebraska, it was actually filmed along the I-29 corridor of northwestern Iowa. Why is this significant? I don't know. It's just an interesting point of trivia. Children of the Corn has a few recognizable faces in it. Linda Hamilton had not yet hit the big time, and neither had Peter Horton. Courtney Gains has gone on to have a pretty good career, and R.G. Armstrong is perfect for little bit parts like his one in this film.Proceed with caution on this one. 4 of 10 stars is about all it's worth.The Hound.

Classics like 'The Exorcist' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' find new fans with each generation. Why? Well, largely because they deal with universal themes such as loss of innocence, death, and good vs. evil. Then there are some films that were not hits in their day and have received minimal praise. Based on a short story by Stephen King, 'Children of the Corn' is one of those films that a lot of people saw when they were younger and they remember it being better then. It's since spawned eight sequels and a remake, but was that really necessary? The first film, after all is said and done, is not at all a bad film and is worth a look. It just isn't in the same league as the greatest hits of Horror.Pros Good performances by all. Good score, including an eerie main theme. A few chilling sequences, especially the opening moments. Fritz Kiersch gets some really good shots and inserts some style. Moves at a good pace most of the time. Decent, if a tad dated, visual effects in the finale. The kids really are creepy, which had they not been would have really broke the film.Cons Pace could have used some tightening at times. Lacking suspense. A not totally satisfying conclusion. Word has it the budget was reduced during production, which could explain that. Hasn't aged too well.Final thoughts There is plenty to enjoy during this films near 90 minute running time.

The name is full of promise, the mayhem and creepiness are pretty much guaranteed, yet the end product is incredibly dull. Based on a short story by Stephen King, it had a great potential right from the start. Unfortunately, the name and the title alone do not a movie make (and it seems Mr. King felt the same way and disowned it).There are only a few memorable moments, and they have to do with Linda Hamilton, the only professional actor in the cast, apparently. There is a scene where she sings School is out and it is pretty much the only bit of this movie that is worth watching. Her partner in crime, Peter Horton, is a tall, blond, white version of Carl Lewis he can run fast but that's about all he can do. Actually, I've seen Carl Lewis act and he is a far better actor.The script is not worth mentioning. Maybe just to say that taking one line from the Bible and making a movie out of it is not all that fantastic.

His comedic timing was good, and he was helpful instead aggravating like most movie kids in this type of picture. The two leaders of the cult, Isaac and Malachi, give looks that can chill, but they become laughable after opening their mouths. The scene where Malachi overthrows Isaac could fit well in Revenge Of the Religious Nerds. I understand the director wanted Hitchcockian violence, but the film can be too cutesy and appears as if it was intended to earn a PG rating. Burt and Vicky don't seem disturbed at all by the deserted town, and you hope to see them offed because of their stupidity. Why not have the kids destroy the car when the couple are exploring the diner? That would've given them a legit reason to stick around. The way the kids turn away from the cult was highly unconvincing. How could Burt who mocks religion preach about false religion? Maybe the creators wanted us to use our imaginations again to figure out the demon's secrets. Still, non-readers of Night Shift will be puzzled as to why it wants adults dead.

The source material itself is one of King's merely decent moments, and only presents a sketch of the events that are fleshed out here, so we're left to trust the film-makers to put some meat on the bones of this tale about a cult-like band of religious zealot children who murder any adults they come across to appease an unseen god that lurks in the vast cornfields surrounding their desolate town. Though the core concept is rather intriguing, the execution here leaves a lot to be desired, and while Children Of The Corn isn't awful, it also isn't good.The bulk of King's original story is represented here, and the set-up that leads our hapless couple into the lair of the murderous children is portrayed quite well. But the film uses one of these children (a non-murderous one, luckily for the couple) to narrate the tale, which allows the film-makers to delve into elements of King's story that were only hinted at in the text, but also confuses the entire plot as we try to make sense of why only the narrator and his companion have managed to reject the religious fervor that grips every other child in the small Nebraska town.The source of this spiritual mania, only alluded to in King's story, is given full reign here, and that's ultimately what makes this film so utterly goofy. You see, our titular Children aren't just moved by their sinister saviour (He Who Walks Behind The Rows, natch) to murder all of the adults in town, but also to gather in the cornfields conducting religious sermons in wildly antiquated language. If the humor in these lengthy interactions between the psychobabble-spouting children was intentional, then we have to praise the film-makers for getting their point across, but one suspects that the kids are mostly playing things straight. This makes clunky dialogue like question me not, Malachai, for it is I who has been chosen and the classic Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, Outlander! inherently hilarious.Since we're relying almost exclusively on a cast of children, it isn't surprising that most of the acting in this film is atrocious. The afore-mentioned dialogue certainly doesn't help in this regard, and we can see the Children struggling to make sense of the Victorian language they are asked to emote (seize him? Who EVER says seize him?). The lanky lad portraying the evil Malachai has a particularly hard time keeping a straight face while spewing his hateful machinations, which is particularly fitting since we end up having a hard time keeping a straight face while we watch him spew them. Ditto with Isaac, the de facto leader of this crop-worshiping cult, thus the source of most of the silliest passages of lugubrious religious rhetoric.While a massacre in a diner starts the plot off, since the MPAA zealously neutered this film this expository sequence loses much of its horrific value. Most of the movie beyond the onset is relatively bloodless, which strips away the implied menace of the blade-toting kids, since we rarely see the results of their handiwork. Clearly there wasn't a big budget for effects, and this is never more evident than during the scenes where He Who Walks Behind The Rows manifests Himself, which integrate live footage with some very cheap and shoddy fire animation.Wisely, the film-makers have the sense to keep their apparently subterranean beast under wraps, but one of the ambiguities of King's original story was whether the children actually were in service of some dark presence, or if a collective insanity settled over them and prompted them to create a myth to support their murderous deeds. Personally, I find the second scenario more frightening. Apparently, the film-makers disagree with me, and they make it clear that there is something dwelling underneath the cornfield (shouldn't it be He Who Walks BELOW The Rows, then?). This sort of negates the sensibility of the climactic showdown with He, since laying waste to the cornfields with fire wouldn't do much to destroy a creature that lives safely burrowed under the cornfield, would it? Of course, this leaves definite room for a sequel... no less than six, in fact. I've never invested my time in any of the follow-ups, so I can't judge those objectively, but despite the few bits of inspiration here, Children Of The Corn is barely worth visiting once, let alone returning to for multiple harvests.But we do have to thank the Children for providing satire fodder for a particularly funny episode of South Park. Indeed, seeing this film makes a great deal of The Wacky Molestation Adventure that much more hilarious, so I can certainly recommend it for that purpose.However, as a horror film, Children Of The Corn is just too silly to have much impact. The premise here is decent, however, so perhaps the 2009 television remake did better things with it. I'll let you know when I see it.

This is a bad thing because the filmmakers got some of the worst child actors to have played these villains, with an exception of Robby Kiger and AnneMarie McEvoy. On top of that, the film takes so much time setting up everything. In fact, it's not until the 55 minute mark where something finally happens, but this is so very unfortunate because the movie is about 93 minutes long. If my calculations were correct, the film spent about 60% of the time setting up. That is a long time.However, there are some good news to this story.

When an mysterious boy preacher Issac (John Franklin) convinced the whole children/teenagers to kill their parents and other adults in their town. An few years has passed, when a traveling couple Burton (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton) are stopping in this seemingly empty town. But they find themselves stalked by evil children, especially Malachai (Courtney Gains) wants to kill these outlanders. But when they captured Vicky to be an sacrifice for something unspeakable evil in the cornfields for their unholy god. Burton finds help from two normal children (Robby Kiger and Anna Maire McEvoy), who agreed to help Burton to save his girlfriend from these evil kids. But that night, they meet He Who Walks Behind The Rows and Judgment Day might come for all of them.Directed by Fritz Kiersch (Into the Sun, Tuff Turf, Surveillance) made an watchable Horror movie, which is based on a short story by Stephen King (Cat's Eye, 1408, The Shawshank Redemption). I remember seeing this film as a child. I thought this film was extremely creepy and scary as well. But watching this today as an adult, u could see their flaws on this ambitious film. Good performances by the cast saved it from being an complete disaster. This is an well directed film with some strong moments of violence but falls apart in the third act. Even Stephen King was disappointed with the adaptation of his short story. This had some controversies, when the picture was out. The scenes, where kids are murdering adults in the movie but it's done so tastefully that the director made it suggestive instead. Some of the dialogue is unintentional funny as well. But the film went on have Six Sequels! (Children of the Corn 3 is actually quite good, however) and this picture went on to have an major cult following over 20 years is been out.DVD from Anchor Bay is the 20th anniversary edition. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an fine, digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fine sometimes humorous commentary track by the director, producer and actorsFranklin & Gains. DVD also has fascinating featurette with interviews by the director & two cast members, original theatrical trailer, poster & still gallery and more. Although i would love to hear production stories by Horton and Hamliton but they are probably embarrassed with this campy/cult classic. This film also has an memorable music score by Johathan Elias (Pathfinder 2007, Shakedown, Vamp). Still, it was one of the most bizarre movies to come out in the early 1980's. Die Hard fans of King's work will certainly find some amusement here and others should beware. Not for all tastes. (*** ¬Ω/*****).

The opening five or ten minutes is quite creepy, but once the film properly gets started, it turns to mush. The concept is very spooky, but never used in a remotely effective way. The children's leader Isaac is given some dreadful dialogue, which actor John Franklin delivers in a ludicrously overblown theatrical manner. His henchman Malakai at least looks mean, but still doesn't get good dialogue, or the chance to do anything particularly menacing. The rest of the kids convey virtually no menace, and the relentlessly weak direction snuffs out the chance for even mindless thrills. Its rare that I don't root for the bad people in horror movies, but I found the children in this more annoying than anything else and I kept wanting the heroes to clip them all round the ears and send them to bed with no supper. I mean, for pity's sake, they're just a bunch of idiot unruly kids and the fact that they're supposed to be evil and murderous barely registers. I never once believed them capable of such acts unless murder by force of sheer irritation is possible. With virtually no gore or suspense, no nudity and a bunch of lame special effects making up the climax, there's not much reason to watch this past the opening. Once the beautiful Linda Hamilton and husband Peter Horton arrive on the scene the movie commences spiralling down. I actually found their performances to be sympathetic, although this might just be my own sympathy at seeing likable actors in such a poor film. My verdict is avoid, no matter what anyone says, and go straight to the ludicrous but infinitely superior first two sequels.

Here, it's Gatlin, Nebraska, a town in which all the adults have been slaughtered in the bloodiest fashion by their children. Gatlin is now depopulated, the streets littered, the shops closed, no services -- just kids sneaking around and worshiping a god of the corn. They got religion. The religion they got seems lifted from Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough, which described pagan religion as fertility rites in the crops, and periodic sacrifice.The kids here have the sacrifice part down pat. Their last sacrifice, the blue man, is a dead cop whose shrunken corpse is strung up on a cross made of wood and cornstalks. They screwed up the fertility part, though. Instead of copulating in the cornfields like decent law-abiding pagans, all they do is kill anybody who crosses them. That's no way to grow corn.It's into this stagnant pit of religious retrogression that newly minted doctor Peter Horton and his wife Linda Hamilton gaily stumble. They're driving through the flatlands of Nebraska on the way to Horton's internship out west but they slam into a kid who is standing in the middle of the deserted road with his throat already cut. This causes them to lose their √©lan. And they do everything wrong. All the roads seem to lead them to Gatlin, a place they've been warned against visiting. Instead of gaping for a moment at the ominously deserted town and then speeding away towards the sun, they begin to explore the place. They don't know it, but one of the members of the kiddie cult has had a vision identifying them as the next sacrifices.I won't go on with this silliness. I don't know what King's original story was like, but the director of this film can't WAIT to shock us with blood and violence, and he does so without nuance or originality. The pre-credits opening scene is filled with blood letting and poisoning. And just after Horton and Hamilton run over the kid, Hamilton falls asleep in the car (if you can believe it) and has a horrible dream which is presented to the viewer as reality -- until she awakes with a yelp and a big BANG on the sound track, called a sting in the industry. R. G. Armstrong and his dog Sarge show up for a few moments, only to be butchered like everybody else.The thing is, if this had been handled differently it might have been so much better. The photography and location shooting are fine. The uniform countryside seems to run on forever, an ocean of level crops. There really is something eerie about miles and miles of cornfields. You can't help looking at this sea of pea-green leaves, brushed by the occasional soft breeze, and the scattered tiny towns with shops that sell farm implements, used pick up trucks, and Redman chewing tobacco. Everything is so tranquil that you can't help but wonder what the hell is GOING ON! But the rush to get into the bath tub of gore ruins it. Good horror stories let you in little by little. They don't stuff your face into it right off the bat, the Berlitz method of movie making.The acting isn't bad except for one of the kids, a tall pale red head with a protruding jaw, whose looks are repellent enough but who speaks with a Valley accent and, not to be too blunt about it, can't act. Peter Horton does okay by the doctor. He's rather tall and lanky. He looks like he runs daily, which every doctor should do. Linda Hamilton looks peachy with her robust features, broad ramus and plump lips. She was my supporting player in the classic commercial and critical hit, King Kong Lives. She was a little nervous at the time but I helped her over the rough spots. She was grateful enough to send me Christmas cards each year with personal checks for fifteen cents enclosed.If you want to see a much better movie about modern pagans worshiping their crops, try The Wicker Man. If you want to see a better movie about mysterious cornfields, watch Field of Dreams. Children of the Corn is a grindhouse product.

Watching it again years later it didn't have quite the same effect on me but it still holds it's own as a cult classic. First of all you have the benefit of the original short story being written by one of the greatest modern day writers of our time...Stephen King. And although Children of The Corn strays a little from the typical Stephen King recipe there are still a lot of things in tact from his usual genre. Isolation, disturbing religious fanaticism, an unsuspecting hero making a change in his or her life. The idea behind Children of the Corn is just downright disturbing and the portrayals of the children and their twisted world will keep you riveted. They do a terrific job of making sure you understand this strange religion they are involved in but still leave a certain element of mystery to it which is great. The film balances horror with a psychological aspect and despite a low budget and some terrible special effects the film is a classic.Multi talented actor director and producer Peter Horton plays the lead hero in one of his very early roles. Horton is really terrific in the role. He has a certain amount of down to earth quality while still maintaining this touch exterior that makes him a worthy hero. He has this level of intensity to him and he really does a great job. I'm kind of surprised this role didn't gain him more big screen main roles. Probably minutes before changing the world as tough as nails screen hero Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton played the more soft spoken Vicky. We know now what kind of a screen presence she can be and she's kind of underplayed as more of the damsel in distress in this film. Her and Horton are a great couple and have good chemistry and the thing with both of them is that they are very down to earth and very believable. They are just average people in an extraordinary circumstance. John Franklin is kind of the mascot of the series and this film as enraged god-filled Issac. His role is kind of subtle but he's so important and really does make a difference in his role and didn't return to the series until fifteen years later but this first performance was his claim to fame. He fits the role perfectly. Starting a very lucrative career in this first role is Courtney Gains as the deranged killer Malachai. His performance is probably the highlight of the film and is really the true villain since Franklin's character never actually performs any violence against anyone. It's a shame the character of Malachai didn't return in future installments and especially Gains in the role because he was awesome.There were a few things that really make me love this film. First of all the empty town...I love the whole isolation and wiped out apocalyptic feel and they do a good job with small shots of empty stores and such. I also think they do a terrific job with explosions in the film considering the special effects they use for 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows' is simply god awful period. It's terrible...one of the worst effects I've ever seen but it's tolerable since they don't use it a lot. Although apparently not it's original ending I really did like where they went with the ending because it breaks the mold of the typical slasher horror flick where you're practically guaranteed not all of the main characters will live and Children of The Corn actually gives you more of an action film type happy ending and I liked that. Regardless of what some think the film is a cult classic for a reason and I will always fondly remember it as one of my favorites. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Political Horror, Don't Be Mistaken","Date":"23 October 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" This movie scared the crap out of me when my dad took me and my older sister to see this.

For one, worry not about the communists but about the Christian religious extremists. What is the issue of the east coast city slicker with his unmarried companion going to Seattle but gets stuck in America's heartland. We are not stupid, there are clues that tell us there is more to this than a busy year in Linda Hamilton's life. Remember she starred in Terminator the same year.

One of the many stories of Stephen King's to be adapted for the silver screen during the 80's. Like many of them instead of making a movie solely based upon the written material, the film-makers decide to take only parts of the story branching out into something that barely resembles the original concept. Instead of a truly scary film about religion gone mad, we're treated to a very lame movie filled with a bunch of bad actors and a wretched script that only a mid-level hack could spew out.A yuppie couple traveling cross-country runs into a small farm town that's populated by a community of children all hopped up on religion. What will happen when the lovebirds come into town? Check it out for yourself! Sounds better than it really is.Recommended for true 80's nostalgia fans.

Let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be any less interesting than Children of the Corn.Based on one of King's many short stories, this 1984 horror flick sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy Nebraska town of Gatlin, where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the corn fields.Although director Fritz Kiersch does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's silly song and dance, but before we get to meet the freakish Isaac, leader of the killer kids), he completely blows it with endless unexciting scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted down by the town's homicidal half-pints. Courtney Gains, as violent redhead Malachai, manages to appear genuinely menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening; as a result, many of the film's 'scary' moments fail to work. Towards the end of the film, when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding Gatlin, the film descends into a glut of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years ago, but look positively laughable nowadays.Children of the Corn might be of interest to King fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror-film fan will be most unimpressed.

Not to mention Malicai's over dramatic stick up his butt character.Children of the Corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a God that commands them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people.

I think so...","Date":"11 December 2005","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Children of the Corn starts in 'Gatlin, Nebraska Three Years Ago' where, suddenly & without warning, the town's children brutally kill all the adults seemingly orchestrated by a creepy young preacher boy named Isaac (John Franklin)... The film then switches to the 'Present Day' as lovers Burton Stanton (Peter Horton) & Vicky Baxter (Linda Hamilton) are on a long journey through the middle of nowhere when a teenage boy named Joseph (Jonas Marlowe) stumbles out into the road, Burt cannot stop in time & hits him head on. Burt & Vicky rush to help but find him already dead & even worse he has had his throat cut. They decide to head to the nearest town & report the incident, the nearest town being Gatlin. Once there they discover the place totally deserted, in a state of ruin & corn lying around everywhere. The also quickly discover that Isaac has created his own religious cult by convincing all the town's children to worship a god known as 'He Who Walk's Behind the Rows' where adults are offered as sacrifices. Isaac says that Burt & Vicky will do nicely, he sends the murderous Malachai (Courtney Gains) & the rest of the children to get them, however not all the children in Gatlin believe Isaac & young siblings Job (Robby Kiger) & Sarah (Anne Marie McEvoy) set out to try & help the stranded couple...Directed by Fritz Kiersch & despite it's bad reputation I actually rather liked Children of the Corn. The script by George Goldsmith is based on a short story (about 15 pages long) by Stephen King, although I have not read it so I cannot compare the two, & while it goes round in circles a bit I though it was effective enough. The film moves along at a nice pace although during the middle not much seems to happen & that's probably where the padding comes in to stretch the film out to 90 odd minutes. I really like the basic story of children turning against adults & setting up their own religion but the film doesn't go into much depth like for instance at the beginning when the children start to kill the adults I was asking myself what could a freaky looking kid say to everyone to get them to murder their parents, alas it is never explained. Neither do we actually get to see 'He Who Walk's Behind the Rows', I guess it's supposed to be some sort of demonic creature as it burrows under the ground. I did like how it builds up & tries to retain some mysterious elements & for some reason Children of the Corn is just one of those films that I enjoyed but don't quite know why, overall in my eyes it just added up to more than the sum of it's parts.Director Kiersch does a good job here & gives the film a great atmosphere of isolation & eeriness, there was just something about the whole idea & notion that unsettled me a little bit I mean any film that can make a corn field seem creepy is doing something right. While Children of the Corn doesn't have fantastic style to it there are some impressive scenes like the opening massacre, when Joesph is run down & it has that nice unique horror feel throughout & I especially like the shots of the children armed with various dangerous looking farming tools like hooks, scythes, pitchforks & machetes. Disappointingly the violence & gore is somewhat restrained with only a few slit throats, some splattered blood, a few stab & cut wounds & a rotten corpse.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 Children of the Corn is technically an accomplished film with good photography, decent enough special effects although don't expect the latest CGI & it has good solid production values throughout. A special mention for the music by Jonathan Elias which I found particularly good & moody. The acting is pretty good by everyone, Hamilton & Horton do OK & surprisingly the children didn't annoy me as much as child actors usually do & where did they find Malachai & Isaac? They are two freaky & creepy looking kids, well their adults now obviously.I liked Children of the Corn, it seems to get a lot of stick which I can understand I suppose but films are all about personal opinion & I'm going to stand by mine. I think it's definitely worth a watch & at least it's ten times better than the adaptation of King's Graveyard Shift (1990), isn't it?

It's pretty logical, I suppose... King made it a SHORT story, so a long-feature film handling about the same matter is likely to be tedious! Children of the Corn is an excellent example to state this 'theory' the idea is good and the atmosphere is creepy but the script is far too weak to make the film memorable. Vicky and Burt are a young couple on their way to a new life when they're driving through the lonely state of Nebraska. They strand in the grisly town of Gatlin; a place where the children murdered all the adults and formed a satanical cult that gathers in the immense corn fields. The premise contains many good aspects, like the isolated filming location, the compelling musical score, the appellation of the supernatural 'evil' character (He Who Walks Behind The Rows) and the casting of the town's two main freak-boys Isaac (John Franklin) and Malachai (redhead Courtney Gains in his debut). But, regretfully enough, there are too many clich√©s and predictable twists that ruin everything! The cheap visual effects during the finale destroy all the suspense which was build up rather ingeniously.Children of the Corn certainly wasn't the first horror picture handling about murderous youngsters and by no means it is the best! In 1976, there was this creepy Spanish gem called Qui√©n Puede Matar a un Ni√±o, which easily qualifies as one of the most disturbing horror efforts ever made. The reason why this film is so successful compared to Children of the Corn is partly because of the evoked feelings of total hopelessness AND because it constantly remains unclear why the children suddenly became violent.

As horror movies they are often lacking and the stories on the silver screen rarely work out as they were intended. Children of the Corn is one of those disappointing movies. It's nothing too horrible but it's all pretty standard stuff to watch.Thing about this movie is that it just never drags you into it. It's far from a compelling movie that just never succeeds at becoming an interesting one. It's because the storytelling is quite poor at times. The movie has far too many slow moments in it and really not a lot is ever happening in this movie. They could and should had really added some more suspension and action to the movie, in order to make it and its story work out more effectively. In the end we also still have no idea what was going on all in this movie. The story is even more of a mystery at the end than it was at the beginning. It explains absolutely nothing. The many sequels probably do but I don't think a whole lot of people will be interested in those movies anymore after seeing this one.The story and how certain characters react to the situations they are in are far from likely. This is something I often have problems with in Stephen King adaptations. They don't even seem scared or shocked at anything that happens in the movie.It's also pretty simple to me why this movie did not really work out as a creepy or atmospheric one. Blame it on the children. I'm sorry but having this many children as the evil ones in this movie is just not a scary thing. You're just never scared for any of those kids because well, no matter how you look at it they are still kids. Children of course also often are lacking the right acting skills to let their characters work out believable enough, as is the case in this movie.A movie that just doesn't work out too well.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Poor Adaptation","Date":"4 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Children of the Corn (1984) * 1/2 (out of 4) Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton play a couple driving through Nebraska on their way to a new job when they run over a child in the street. Turns out someone had already slashed his throat and soon the couple find themselves in a creepy town ran by satanic kids. The films taken from the work of Stephen King were always hit and miss but for some reason this one has become a cult favorite over the years. I'm really not sure why that is because I've always found this first entry to be rather boring, bland and at times rather laughably bad. I know it might be a sin for a viewer to put logic in a horror film because I'm sure 95% of them could be ripped to pieces if you did that. However, it's really impossible for me to overlook the logical problems here and a lot of these are the reason why the film doesn't work as well as it could have. I think the atmosphere is about right as we get that deserted town feel but very little is done with it. It seems like the director is stuck between a rock and a hard place as they want to go for creepy thrills but at the same time they're obligated to throw in cheap gore to please the slasher films of the time. In the end I think the film fails on both levels as its not scary and it's too slow to work in the slasher mode. Horton and Hamilton are decent, if nothing special while most of the kids come off quite annoying. To make matters worse, the screenplay has way too many loose ends, the music score is downright horrid and the special effects are eye opening bad. "}]
