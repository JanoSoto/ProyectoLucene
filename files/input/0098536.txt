In terms of storyline of 'Turner & Hooch' is not developed from a novel concept, the humorous treatment and the hilarious and endearing interaction between the lead pair is what makes it a charming little film. Tom Hanks is totally great in one of his early roles as a policeman who suffers from perfectionism and is challenged by the entrance of a pooch into his life. The guy shows a flair for comedy that has hardly been noticed by many filmmakers. Beasley is fantastic and absolutely adorable (once you get passed the drooling). Mare Winningham is good as Hanks's love interest. They are quite convincing enough as a romantic pair. There are plenty of wonderful moments in the film and it is hard to pick a favourite but the first scenes that come to mind are the stakeout scene where Turner is chatting with a bored Hooch and the scene where he comforts a grieving Hooch. I love the film for its simplicity and heart along Hanks and Beasley. An awesome fun little flick!

Basically The Odd Couple with a dog. It's predictable and formulaic to the bone, but hits a strange nerve that allows us to overlook its shortcomings and appreciate the sweetness of the ride. Hanks is largely to thank for that, at the top of his game very early in his dramatic career. Though a few not-so-surprising supporting actors pop in from time to time, (Reginald VelJohnson as a policeman? What a shock!) it's almost entirely a one-man show that sails beyond expectations on the merits of his lone performance. In fact, the closest competition is Beasley the dog, who's absurdly emotive and personable throughout the film. He and Hanks make for a great team, as silly as that might sound, and it's easy to tell that a lot of their best scenes were ad-libs that miraculously avoided the cutting room floor.

But it's not all comedy. It is also about crime. And the part when Hooch dies (near the ending) is very sad - I didn't like that part. The movie also has some characteristic stuff from the 80's, which is a good thing. The movie's best known actor is Tom Hanks, here in one of his early roles. I can't say I like him very much. I don't think he's that great as an actor. He often portrays ridiculous and annoying characters and his humor is usually too much clown-like, but here he is good. Even here he shows some of his typical trademarks, but far more natural and not in an irritating way. Tom Hanks is hilarious in this one, something unusual on him. This is one of the few (if not one of the only) films which he isn't annoying.Tom Hanks's character, the police investigator Scott Turner, is more of an obsessively neat guy and funny at the same time, however with a major tendency for anger (he loses his temper easily and yells a lot).Reginald VelJohnson is more funny than great, but one can't deny that his character, detective David Sutton, has sense of humor.The dog, however, is the real star of the movie and naturally a great actor. Beasley the Dog, a Dogue de Bordeaux, portrays Hooch, apparently a foul-tempered dog that loves to destroy things, but once we get to know him better, we realize that he's got an even temper. By the way, that dog drools in such a way that's unbelievable. I wonder if that dog breed really drools like that or if they just overdo it in the movie for comical effect.Hooch, however, isn't the only dog worth mentioning.

For me, there was actual chemistry between him and the dog. That scene where they talked in the car was hilarious. The other actors weren't bad but weren't notable.Other scenes where the dog made a mess or was particularly disgusting were to be expected, but they were enjoyable nevertheless, mostly due to us expecting Hank's reactions and him actually delivering. Sure, he was a bit over the top sometimes, but it worked. The actual police action stuff was less interesting and pretty standard for the times.

The other issue in the film is the scene when Tom Hanks cuts a piece of meat into small pieces in a comical way with a tool like axes and gives it to dog, although the dog prevents eating. A question arises to my mind why the blood of dog is not of one color? Because it is faithful? Because we can show the feeling of subjection in association with this beast and meanwhile keep calm and kind and kind-hearted? Why protests against killing of the other animals and using of their meat in a large amount and continuously, is extensively inconsiderable in comparison with protests against killing and hurting of dog?

In the late 80's the subject du jour seemed to be 'cop teamed with a dog'. This and K-9 were entries into that niche segment of the market. A heck of a lot of people find dogs personable, of course, so the crucial component that guarantees a good pairing is a likable star to go alongside the furry performer. Few can do likable as easily and naturally as Tom Hanks, and his flair for the zany helps see to it that all ensuing proceedings are kept nice and lively. Even the romance is bearably sweet without becoming schmaltzy or dominating the whole show.The sequence of events that lead to him becoming an animal guardian for the first time are perhaps intentionally kept murky for the sake of family-orientated viewing, so the only thing about it that has any 'bite' at all is Hooch (don't worry, his bark is worse!) but if you're a sucker for cute pets plus Hanks' breezy charm, then you'll be entranced in no time.

Hooch the dog saw the murderer and tried to stop him, but he couldn't. Anyway, now Turner has to look after Hooch until they can get an idea of what happened to the victim, and they have some idea of the murderer's identity. This is obviously where the comedy comes from, basically the dog behaving really badly and ruining Turner's house in the best and funniest ways possible.

This one had its charms, but overall I think it suffers from a weak plot device to get the dog in Hanks' character possession. While in K-9 it made perfect sense, Belushi's character needed a drug sniffing dog and he ended up with his. In this one though the dog's owner is killed and Hanks takes the dog in the hopes it will somehow identify the killer. Granted it is a movie, but it is still a bit far fetched that this cop would think a dog is his best lead to catch a killer, and it seems even more implausible that a super neat person would take this super messy dog into his home. Still, it makes from some funny scenes here and there with a rather funny scene where the dog is wrecking the house while poor Hanks is out spending a ton of money on said dog for chew toys and such. There is also a rather funny stake out scene too. The film sometimes loses its luster with a few to many needless characters such as Reginald VelJohnson. I like the guy in Die Hard, but here he is just another person to take away screen time from Hanks and the dog. There are a few other pointless people in this as well, and this has a rather bad ending in my opinion as well (sorry, but dogs do not have perfect clone puppies like that).

Yet there is a third who by rights should join them. This actor made but one film, yet his ability to project bravery, loyalty, compassion and the boisterous joy of living through his acting was, many believe, without parallel. He died at the height of his fame, a mere three years after his triumphant success in this film. Let there now be three stars in that tragic but noble pantheon...Dean, Mineo and Beasley. And let it be recognized, without envy or jealousy, that Beasley's ability to project drool was far greater and more accurate than Dean and Mineo combined. Turner & Hooch is a low key, modest comedy crime caper with a heavy dose of light romance thrown in. Tom Hanks plays Detective Scott Turner, a young man who is far too neat for his own good. He's about to transfer from his small town of Cypress Beach to the big city when a friend, an old man played by that great character actor John McIntire, is murdered. Turner delays his move and pleads with his police chief to be given the case. He's sure the old man's dog, a big, slobbering French Mastiff named Hooch (Beasley) saw what happened and can help identify the killer. Turner agrees to have Hooch live with him while he's on the case. Not to cut the plot to short, Turner and Hooch solve the case, but not without wild car chases, tense shoot-outs, money laundering, veterinary examinations, furniture chewing, refrigerator raiding and a lot of slobber. The movie's plot, of course, is just an excuse to allow two actors with great likability to do their stuff. Hanks had by now already proved how skilled a light comedy actor he was. More to the point, he had the sort of personality and slightly goofy looks that created instant empathy with an audience. Beasley, however, was the surprise. A novice actor, he was an unknown without even off-Broadway experience. He carried out his role with the skill and subtlety of a pro. Just as some actors can cause real tears to run down their faces at the command of a director, Beasley was uncanny in his ability to generate, as needed, drool. His resourcefulness also has become legend. In one scene, the sight of Hanks prancing around his apartment wearing a pair of tighty-whities (black ones) threatened to derail Hollywood's gay fashion industry. Fortunately, Beasley suggested quietly to the director that some amusing antics on his part might distract the audience from the odd awfulness of Hank's appearance. He was right. Yet the scene where Hanks and Beasley are on the pier and Scott Turner must wrestle Hooch to the police car is a fine example of ensemble acting by two talented and unselfish actors, each totally into their characters and yet giving fully to the other. At the end of the movie the murder has been solved, the mastermind unmasked and young Turner has become chief of police. He has a wife, the veterinarian Dr. Emily Carson (played winningly by Mare Winningham). They have a baby on the way. They will remember Hooch in many ways, and so will Emily's collie. I like Turner & Hooch a lot. It's pleasant entertainment with two likable and skilled actors and a story that hangs together. Wherever in that pantheon they reside, I'm sure Dean and Mineo are working with Beasley, now all of them close friends, to perfect slobber on command.

Personally, I like his mad-cap days better. I mean, Big, The Money Pit and Turner and Hooch...the first I could give or take, but it was very funny. The latter two are two of my favourite movies because they are fun and light, and never have to be taken seriously. T&H falls into this category perfectly.Tom Hanks plays neat-freak Scott Turner, a small-town detective who has, over the years I guess, forged a bond with an old man who lives at the docks with his brutish but fanatically-loyal dog Hooch, a drooling, beer-swilling Dog De Bordeaux who hasn't bathed in a while, but a true gentle giant. Anyway, in some formulaic twists, the old man is murdered by some dodgy guys doing money-laundering at the nearby fishworks, and Hooch is Turner's only witness, so he adopts Hooch in the hope that the dog can identify a voice or a smell of the killer/s. Needless to say, some slapstick and some heartwarming moments later, Turner and Hooch become fast and permanent friends.Story takes a little bit of a backseat to the growing relationship between these two, as well as the (not a little bit contrived) blossoming romance with Mare Winningham...who for some reason gets on my nerves even though she's not in the least bit untalented or obnoxious. Maybe she reminds me of an ex...or some wicked queen who imprisoned me in a past life...anyway...SPOILER...i am still, to this day, after maybe 20 viewings, torn by the ending. I think it was good, in that Turner wasn't really Hooch's owner, Hooch missed his real owner, so had to die at the end in order (I presume) to be reunited with his real owner in doggy/human heaven...but to this day, and even after all those viewings...it still makes me misty eyed and I still cheer for old Hoochy to pull through even though I know he won't...pulls at my guts and my heart strings every d*mn time I watch it...yes it would have been a bit trite to have a happy ending...and I think if Hooch DIDN'T die I probably wouldn't like this movie as much because it would NOT have instilled those emotions in me...but still...I loved Hooch and it was sad to see him go.And lastly...Beasley (the Dog De Bordeaux who played Hooch) was NOT, I repeat, NOT shot during the production...good god...and yes, sadly he died a long time ago, but thanks to cinema magic he has been immortalised for all time...well until humankind doesn't watch movies anymore and we all just plug our heads into a wall outlet to receive our daily entertainment.Bravo to everyone concerned with this film, it's great! And I certainly hope Tom Hanks looks back on his mad-cap days with fondness, because I sure do!

He's a very neat and tidy police officer. He was going to be leaving the force to persue another career in Sacramento. He had only three days left and in those three days, Turner would encounter events that would change his life forever.           One morning, Turner and his partner in training David, go down to the docs to talk to crusty but kindly old man Amos. Turner and Amos were good friends. Amos also had a dog, Hooch, whom though he had a cute face, was very tough and very fierce. He expressed his liking of Turner by pinning him down by the neck. Amos complained about noises at the nearby sea food factory. Something was going on there. Little did they know there was more going on there than met the eye. That night, poor Amos was killed by two guys Zack Gregory and Mr. Boyett, who were in on the odd goings on at the factory.         Turner was left to take Hooch. He tried the vet, but the veteranarian, Dr. Emily Carson, suggested Turner take him in, so Turner agreed. I mean, how tough could having a dog be? He soon got his answer that night. Hooch barked loudly, keeping Turner awake. When Turner wondered aloud what he should do, a neighbor suggested they both take Valium. Turner threatened to have the man's car towed. Next night, Turner went to the super market, leaving Hooch alone in the house. When Turner returned, he found his house A MESS!        The next day, Turner brought Hooch to work. He just couldn't get rid of him. Hooch discovered one of Amos' murderers at a wedding and chased him away; Turner does more investigating and discovers smuggling going on in the sea food plant. He and Hooch investigate further and discover their own police chief Howard Hyde was on the bad guys' side. In the end, Zack Gregory, Mr. Boyett and Hyde are taken out, but sadly, so is Hooch.         A happy ending Turner get's married to Dr. Carson and they have a puppy Hooch to deal with.

No, seriously - not only is the two-time Oscar winner acted off the screen by a dog but it's a rare treat to find an actor of quality resorting to bargain-basement nonsense such as this. Having said that, this movie is more fun than its stretched premise suggests but if you've already watched K9 then the chances are that this will be of limited enjoyment.Hanks plays obsessively tidy Scott Turner, a detective in a sleepy corner of coastal America. A mere three days before he leaves for the city and real cases, Turner's world is turned upside-down when his friend Amos Reed (John McIntire) is found murdered down at the docks. Forced into taking care of Reed's slobbery dog Hooch, Turner and his partner David Sutton (Reginald VelJohnson, of Die Hard fame) must crack the case before Hooch completely ruins Turner's life and his budding romance with local vet Emily Carson (Mare Whinningham).You can probably imagine what this movie is like. Lots of slow-motion shots of the dog slobbering everywhere, contrived domestic chaos not seen since the climax of Home Alone and Hanks in shouty-comic mode. And you'd be right, though the dog is truly fantastic! Even without Hanks, the dog manages to hold your attention far better than anyone else in this movie and provides almost all of the laughs. As for his two-legged co-star, Hanks is decidedly average at best and even unlikeable in a couple of scenes. The story is pretty basic and everybody else blends into the background like a piece of scenery. Nothing feels plausible or natural about it, like an unusual dream someone had and decided to share with the world. Even the dog cannot fight off his human masters forever and by the time Hanks is giving orders to Hooch like a SWAT commander and the dog understands (but of course!), you know that you've seen enough.With a more imaginative screenplay and stronger performances, this might have been a classic. Instead, Turner And Hooch has become something of a guilty pleasure for some - including my Better Half who begged me for the DVD this Christmas. It's not big or clever but it does deliver the right amount of laughs to justify seeing it at least once. Hardly a classic but then, how many ugly dogs have won Best Actor at the Academy Awards? If there was any justice in the world then the dog should have become a huge star and Hanks would have faded into obscurity. Oh well.

If, on the other hand, Tom Hanks at his nauseatingly over-the-top worst makes you wanna gag, then you should avoid this movie at all costs, except for the fact that the dog is so cute. And if Hollywood's PC routine leaves you cold, better have a parka handy cuz this piece of fluff has PC written all over it, from Hanks' endlessly affable black partner to the kindly Asian grocery guy to the fawning female vet who (unlike most vets I've come across) really loves animals and is desperate to get Hanks in the sack, to the altar, and siring her brood as quickly as possible. The humor in this farce, aside from that provided by the eminently watchable dog, falls absolutely flat, particularly that which emanates unceasingly from its thoroughly unfunny human star, Mr. Hanks. How can a minimally talented clown like ole Tom become a multi-millionaire? He seems completely unable to project a sense of simple dignity, and for that has been made rich and successful by Hollywood, in particular, and American society, in general. The only flick I ever liked with Hanks in it was Every Time We Say Goodbye, with Christina Marsillach, where he plays an American flier in the RAF during WWII who falls for an enchanting Sephardic Jewess in Jerusalem. Little did we know then that Hollywood's favorite director, Steven sugary pap Spielberg, was getting set to foist Hanks off as some sort of Greatest Generation wonder boy and be roundly applauded by all the clueless phonies in the Academy. Geez, is THAT ever a stretch.

Personally, I am not one of those wierdos who values the lives of dogs more than those of humans. I also was very bored, and was disappointed in the stupidity portrayed by the famous Tom Hanks. Plot? and (more importantly) Point? Not much here. I dunno who could come up with such a pathetic storyline. I was kinda embarrassed watching this. Don't waste your money or your time on this film...
