[{"Title":"Good, really, really good!","Date":"8 June 2005","Score":"25 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This is a great series! Actually I could stop right here because I have already said what needs to be said but just for people's enjoyment I'll elaborate a little.The acting is, much like in the two previous films, excellent. Somehow Mel Gibson and Danny Glover never seem to get tired of each other and it shows because their playful banter never seems to get tiring to the audience. Mel Gibson is a class actor and this time around he develops the character of Martin Riggs even further than he did in the second film. He is so good at portraying emotions that the audience genuinely feels with him. When he is angry you feel his anger and when he is sad you feel sad, you get the picture. The fact that he is so versatile shows in the contrasts of the character. He is both great in action-sequences and in romantic sequences. As for Danny Glover he also does a great job in bringing his character further and he really does in this installment because you get to see the more negative sides of the character this time around. In the first two films he was the character who didn't evolve much but took pride in it. This time, because retirement is rearing its ugly head, we get to see, what I must suppose was, the facade stripped away and see Murtaugh in his raw, pure form. Joe Pesci also returns this time for the comic relief and he is still funny. There is just something about the character of Leo Getz that is incredibly entertaining. However, the best performance is perhaps done by Stuart Wilson, an incredibly underrated actor who has sadly never really achieved a commercial breakthrough. He is the villain of this film and is perhaps the best villain of the series simply because he has more depth than any other villain in the series. He is also given considerably more screen time than many of the other villains so he really has a chance to shine. Rene Russo appears in this film as Riggs new romantic interest and she may not be the most gifted actress ever to be on film but her chemistry with Mel Gibson is undeniable and her on-screen presence is pretty amazing considering that she is a new entry to the character gallery.The story of the film is the weakest out of all the series (yes even the fourth one) and sometimes it kinda drags. Mainly, however, the story is still highly entertaining and funny. The best element of the script is the fact that villain is an ex-cop this time around and that does that the heroes can hate the villain even more because he is, aside from being a mean bastard, a traitor, almost a symbol of the back-side of the medallion.The action of the film is just like in the two previous movies absolutely brilliant. The action is highly entertaining and well made and Mel Gibson is excellent as an action star as well as many other things.All in all a great entry to a great series. 7/10 "},{"Title":"An Enjoyable Action Comedy","Date":"26 March 2005","Score":"26 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Los Angeles police sergeant Roger Murtaugh and his partner, Sergeant Martin Riggs, arrest Billy Phelps for trying to rob an armored truck, this being just 8 days until Murtaugh is scheduled to retire.

I've enjoyed all the Lethal Weapon flicks and I hope one day to buy a boxed set of DVDs containing all four in the series.  Don't ask which one I think is best.  They're all lots of fun to watch.  Of course, the original didn't have as much humor as its sequels.  Mel Gibson's character was a downtrodden loner, who was established as a loose cannon.  But as the series continued, he suddenly turned into Buddy Hackett, cracking jokes left and right.  Needless to say, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make one of the best on-screen duos in the history of film.  Their characters of Riggs and Murtaugh are like polar opposites, but that's the beauty of it.  That's the essence of the buddy cop genre.  The two partners are always at each other's throats, yet they share a great bond and deliver much humor.  Richard Donner is a spectacular action film director, and there are some breathtaking stunts.  The opening truck chase is extremely memorable. And each and every scene is buoyed by great comic relief.  Gibson says a great line when he arrests the fraudulent truck driver  You have the right to remain unconscious.  Whatever you say...ain't gonna be much.  That's a priceless line!  OK, so the plot is meandering.  There are scenes that are very entertaining, yet don't really move the story along.  But the whole movie is so funny and exciting that I just think...who gives a damn?  I'm having too much fun! Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz, adds additional comic relief.  His bleached blond do is hilarious enough, and his nebbish schtick makes it all the more humorous.  Rene Russo is also added to the cast, to provide some good eye candy.  Just like the Bond girls, there's always a sexy love interest in the Lethal Weapon movies.  In the second movie, there was Patsy Kensit. And there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks he's getting too old for this s**t and is about to retire.  He's suffering a severe middle-age crisis and to add to his problems, he ends up killing one of his son's friends--which he did out of self-defense.  Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy action/comedy, he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscar-winning masterpiece.  Lethal Weapon 3 again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers first-class entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric Clapton/Sting song It's Gonna Be Me.  My score  8 (out of 10)   "},{"Title":"Dumb fun &#150; polished and family friendly fun","Date":"25 January 2002","Score":"16 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Riggs and Murtaugh arrest a man on gun charges just for him to be killed in the interrogation room by ex-cop Jack Travis.  Travis is running illegal guns.  Riggs and Murtaugh team up with IA officer Cole to track down and stop Travis while Murtaugh also faces trouble at home as the illegal guns impact on his family.This third in the series is a lot more polished and refined than the first two - there's a lot of money riding on this now!  The story is quite good but it's not rocket science.  It's really all an excuse to have a series of set pieces - from a building being destroyed to a desert showdown.  The romance between Riggs and Cole take away from Riggs' madman style character and makes the film a lot softer.  It also makes the action scenes a lot less believable as he seems to revert to action hero on cue.  However it does allow some humour.  The involvement of Pesci is funny but at times it's a little stretched.Gibson and Murtaugh are good, mainly because they're just having fun now in well worn characters - like old shoes!  Pesci is not quite as annoying as he was in LW2 but is still a bit of a spare wheel.  Russo is good as the love interest and handles herself well.Overall it's good fun but it lacks the dark, rough tone that made LW such a hit in the first place.

He steals weapons and ammunition from the police. At first they thought it was an inside job so Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) from Internal Affairs is put on the case. She is the perfect match for Riggs, beautiful but tough. We also meet Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) again.

This time the action literally starts with a bang (a big one) when Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) answer a call and, suffice to say, Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene, but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels, perhaps not unusual for L.A., but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets (called `Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest) on the streets, which is really bad news for police officers in general, and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case, but it quickly escalates, and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. 	The first two installments of this series are hard to beat, but as they say, the third time's a charm; and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one, because he pulled off quite a feat-- making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one; the main characters are in place and established, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back, and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good, there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts, and the humor has been toned down a notch, which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. 	By now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep; which may sound like easy street for an actor, but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well (it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point), and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact, and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time, however, is between Gibson and Russo, who click from the beginning, starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna, putting some real style and spunk into her; there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a no-nonsense I.A. investigator, and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them, in which they compare battle scars, that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene, and a good example of how well the script, by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen, was written. 	The supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Traci Wolfe (Rianne), Stuart Wilson (Jack Travis), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Damon Hines (Nick), Ebonie Smith (Carrie) and Gregory Millar (Tyrone).  In the world of the Cinema, it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original, and when the third does, it's a real triumph; and `Lethal Weapon 3' is just that, a triumph.  It's a quality action/drama that exemplifies why this series is so popular.  Simply put, it's a good movie on it's own, and part of a great series; so don't stop now, `Lethal Weapon 4' is ready and waiting for you.  I rate his one 10/10.

In addition, if you're not able to take a buddy cop action movie the third sequel in the Lethal Weapon series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 3 (1992) is for my opinion the second best in the series! I love this flick, I always have enjoyed much more than I did Lethal Weapon 2. I love this sequel, I think is so much better than Lethal Weapon 2! Because the second installment in the series was way too violent movie from the first one, this one was just fun action sequel to the first one and I love it so much! I thought Donner kept the level going for the most part throughout the films!!! Why don't people like the last two movies!! I pretty stayed up half the night for two nights in a row because I got so hooked with these movies!. I especially love Rene Russo she's so sexy, sassy, and kicks a lot of ass in it. A nice addition to the team. Rene Russo in this movie she was the second crush I had on her. She was the most beautiful girl playing a tough cop ever. I was happy her character was not killed off, by the end of the movie. When the film ended I was really sad because I didn't know what happened too Martin Riggs and Lorna Cole, did their romance lasted forever. I was always hooked up and when I hared they are making Lethal Weapon 4 in 1998, I couldn't wait for the fourth installment! I grew up with this movie and it is my childhood movie of all time I love it to death!!!Rock on Riggs and Murtaugh! Perhaps as a reflection of that, Weapon 3 depends more on chases, explosions and set pieces than it does on character development. The story again involves the partnership of Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover), buddies in the long tradition of movie cop partners. This time Murtaugh is only eight days from retirement, a sure sign in any cop movie that his life will be repeatedly in danger. I remember Lethal Weapon 3 was a lot of fun and I would say it's my 2nd favorite of the series. Stuart Wilson was a good bad guy, humor was great including the banter. It's an entertaining sequel. I know a lot of people don't like this movie like I do a lot of fans prefer Lethal Weapon 2 over this flick, I don't! I think 1 and 3 are great flicks, 2 is my third favorite film in the franchise!!! Part 1 and 3 of Lethal Weapon I absolutely love! I enjoyed Lethal Weapon 2, I like Lethal Weapon 4. I really love Lethal Weapon 3, I always had fun with it. I highly enjoy it. I don't mind the story, a lot of people complain about the story. I think that story is very interesting. I think Joe Pesci has more screen time in this movie than in part 2. I love when Riggs cut the wrong wire in the opening scene and the whole Building Explodes. They both grabbed the cat and they save the cat ha ha. Than they went on patrol officer now, not anymore detectives. This movie is fun back and forth. The armored car is driven by this crooks and Riggs is chasing it. Riggs eventually has to brake the vehicle hard, causing the armored car to come to a sudden stop, resulting in the bad guy flying through the windshield and coming to rest on the hood and say my favorite line. You have the right to remain unconscious. Anything you say ain't gonna be much. And Riggs punches the guy in the windshield and says Back to bed. Back to bed. The car chase scene Riggs jumps off the subway and commandeers an LAPD motorcycle, then continues his pursuit of the truck, which has by then left the rails and taken to the streets. Riggs pursues Travis on the wrong side of a freeway, then into a section that was under construction. Travis manages to get stopped, but Riggs flies off an unfinished ramp, getting hung up by some cables. The cables give way, and he falls through several platforms, to the ground. This scene is Excellent and outstanding stunt, I can always watch that! The scene in the hockey arena is one of my favorite when Leo (Joe Pesci) wrestles with Jack Travis (Staurt Wilson) Their struggle carries them onto the ice and Travis shoots Leo in the arm. Riggs follows Travis out of the arena, but loses him. That scene Riggis running on the ice was fantastic. The end fight scene when Murtaugh takes out Walters, then tosses Darryl's gun to Riggs, loaded with the cop killer bullets. Riggs shoots through the bucket of the front-end loader, killing Travis was awesome! This movie is awesome and it is my favorite film in the Lethal Weapon series. It is a 10 for me. Lethal Weapon 3 is the third installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. The 1992 action sequel has Detective Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) under the eye of an Internal Affairs detective (Rene Russo) during an investigation of a former cop who is dealing in illegal arms and armor-piercing ammunition.

After witnessing a murder at the hands of a bogus security team, Riggs sets off in hot pursuit with Murtagh not far behind in the 'real' security vehicle. Riggs and Murtagh contain the situation following a pursuit and some fisticuffs and arrest the driver Billy Phelps (Mark Pellegrino). When they examine his weapon, it turns out that it is a special type of gun that is able to pierce 'armour'. However, before Riggs and Murtagh manage to question Phelps, a man comes into the police station and shoots Phelps and calmly walks away. Riggs, Murtagh and internal affairs officer Lorna Cole (Russo) discover that Phelps has been shot and promptly examine the CCTV footage where Cole identifies the killer as 'Jack Travis' - a former police officer who is into arms in a big way. Riggs, Murtagh and Cole find that they must all work together to try and find out why Travis has murdered Phelps and how the 2 of them are linked; For me, the main problem with this Lethal Weapon entry is that there is very little in the way of a plot. The plot is basically Travis steals lots of arms and uses them against the police and that's pretty much it. We learn very little about Travis's motivations and we get no background information about him. Why did he get involved with arms? Why did he have a vendetta against the police? Who knows? Second we come to Leo Getz - OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK (sorry I couldn't resist). I thought it was quite refreshing when he was introduced in the second film and found him to be tolerable in that film. Getz character also had more relevance to the plot in LW2. I found his character beyond irritating in this film and what exactly was the point of him being in this film? Oh yeah, he's an Estate Agent. Really? I like Joe Pesci and I've enjoyed every other film that he's been in, but I really couldn't stand him in LW3 - as I mentioned he was tolerable in the second film, but I felt he was a bit OTT here.There were other absurd scenes as well like where Cole and Riggs are both showing each other scars from where they've been shot and injured in various places. Why? Not only was it pointless, but it was also unfunny.At least, LW3 still had its funny moments and the chemistry is still strong between Riggs and Murtagh. As far as entertainment goes, this is good. But if you are the sort of person who enjoys a film with a well thought out and coherent plot then this may come as a disappointment. I gave it 5/10 purely for its entertainment value.

Once the forth part of the series comes into fruition, we lose everything that Martin Riggs represented in the whole series. Even his Samson like mane is cropped off which made him look like a man who's aged quite rapidly and even his quick-wit and charm was absent there too.As for the principal antagonist I would like to say that I like the performance of Stuart Wilson as ex-cop Jack Travis. He's at an equal as the wild-eyed Riggs and he was more convincing than Jet Li's villain character in Lethal Weapon 4. Sure Li was a very fierce villain in #4, but still there was a lack of a compelling development like all the other bad guys from the other Lethal Weapons from the past. I thought that it was so sweet that that they added tough, but pretty internal affairs agent Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the cast and the relationship between her Riggs was so refreshing to the story. Sadly the chemistry was absent in Lethal Weapon 4. Besides in the forth instalment Russo was in very few scenes and was not deemed an important character in the story like she was in number three. And I thought it was cool that a female counterpart to Riggs is just as equally bonkers as him.Joe Pesci is back here as the lovable, but obnoxious Leo Getz, and though he provides a chunk of the laughs in this action comedy, he really starts to become annoying after awhile like flies in summertime. The real tender moment in the forth of the series was Leo's mourning of his dead frog But in Lethal Weapon 3 the sentimental scene is much more serious when Murtaugh inadvertently kills an adolescent who happens to be friends of his son (apologies to all frog lovers out there). When it comes to the funniest scenes, it was really hilarious when Riggs tries to befriend a cunning guard dog and acting like the dog. I'll choose that over the cheesy scene with the laughing gas like in Lethal Weapon 4.

Let's get the worst over with.First, the story A ex-cop Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson) who's robbed weapons from the police and Riggs and Murtaugh have to fin d him. He really isn't as good as the villains from 1 and 2. He's the normal action movie villain that I didn't really care about. Joe Pesci is back as Leo Getz, the character who made Lethal Weapon 2 a good sequel. He has his funny bits but only appears at the beginning and at the end. If you really think about he's just there because he's a popular character. Also Riggs and Murtaugh do not do much new and it relies a lot on explosions and action. I felt that some action scenes at the beginning felt forced.Now here are the good things which, luckily there's more good than bad. The new addition is Rene Russo who plays Lorna Cole, she works for International Affairs. At first she doesn't like Riggs or Murtaugh but by the end fall in love with Riggs and they become partners. She can beat up five guys single handily. Riggs and her have a pretty funny scene where they undress by showing each others scars. It's cute and funny. The chemistry between Glover and Gibson is still there even with Pesci's scenes. At the beginning thy go into a building try to defuse a bomb while the bomb squad is on there way. Their chemistry is great and still pretty funny. That and the climax are the two best parts. In the climax they fight at a burning construction sight and it's crazy.Richard Donner knows his way around explosives and big action scenes which is good. But sadly the series got worse form here. 3 stars (out of 4) "},{"Title":"Still not too old for this s- - -.","Date":"1 December 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" My Take Nothing new, but this sequel delivers upon expectations.The ride just keeps getting bigger and better! Although this 3rd entry in the long-running LETHAL WEAPON series no longer has the freshness and originality of its predecessors, director Richard Donner packs every single scene with every hyperactive and explosive set piece they can come up with, throwing in sharp wit for good measure, and it somehow works. LETHAL WEAPON 3 delivers.The plot fairly commonplace An ill-tempered ex-cop (Stuart Wilson) secretly selling confiscated weapons (including armor-piercing bullets) to street gangs and it's up to the oddest partners in the LA police force Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover); the latter only a few days from retirement and still feels his getting a little too old for this sh*t. Rene Russo is thrown in for good measure as tough female officer Lorna Cole, a perfect match for the ever violent Riggs. Joe Pesci's back as the fast-talking Leo Getz (Okay, okay, okay!).Unless you count new excessive gunplay and implausible heroics, there's nothing really new in LETHAL WEAPON 3. But it just comes to prove the theory that if formula is done right, the movie couldn't be all that bad. Although the film may be an exercise in overkill, there's still a lot happening in the film that it doesn't bore, and as in any good franchise, our familiarity with these characters (especially the still strong tandem between Gibson and Glover) make the film feel like another swell reunion with old pals (and an introduction to some new ones). Regardless of Donner going all the way with this 3rd film, the series would eventually be followed by a 4th installment a few years later.Rating **** out of 5.

This time around we get a great inversion of the original premise, as it is Roger who has to deal with a devastating event in his life &#150; he has shot his son's best friend. Back as chatterbox Leo Getz is Joe Pesci, whose role is far less central to the plot this time, but whose presence allows welcome opportunities for the two main protagonists to vent comedy steam in his direction! Also thrown into this explosive mix is Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) as an internal investigator who crosses Riggs on her investigation into missing seized handguns. The romance between the two is unique in the sense that the two are almost identical to each other, even down to their mutual love of the Three Stooges, meaning the relationship is an ongoing battle, each striving for the upper hand! Quite apart from being a verbal and personal match for Riggs, Lorna is also tough as nails, and it is a complement to the direction of series chief Richard Donner and Russo herself that Cole is made to look like a real hard-case. Cole's tough side rarely lets up though the film, allowing plenty of banter once again, but if there is to be a criticism, it is that the romance itself is treated a little lightly, almost as if Riggs and Cole switch from opponents to lovers too quickly. But then, isn't it the same in any relationship? Rapier-quick dialogue is more of a feature than ever, as well as an increasing tendency towards more physical humour, meaning that as all this takes centre stage the character of the villain is little more than a sideshow. We get to see Wilson as Jack Travis, a hard-boiled nasty ex-cop, but there is little character development beyond him killing witnesses and talking down his subordinates. With four full characters already, and the rest of the stock cast &#150; Roger's family, a new cop, Ed the Chief &#150; I guess a caricature evil bad guy was all that was required. And don't forget an unwelcome new love interest for Roger! With such a light and comedic feel to the picture, the last thing that would have felt right would have been some exploration of Travis's grievances and mindset.Although with less going on visually, except the opening car chase, the ending in a burning building site, and Gibson's ponytail, LETHAL WEAPON 3 isn't as striking as its predecessors, it is in every other way a fine continuation of the series. Gibson, Glover, and Pesci are completely comfortable in their respective roles and allow the dialogue to shoot between each other like the electricity between their characters. With a successful complement of big action, the elements are all there for another successful entry into the LETHAL series!

Although it's not as good as the first two Lethal Weapon 3 is still a wonderful sequel.Lethal Weapon 3 sees Riggs(Mel Gibson)and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)back once again now having to deal with Jack Travers(Stuart Wilson)a former L.A.P.D cop turned arms dealer. Now with the help Leo Getz(Joe Pesci)and Internal Affairs cop Sgt. Lorna Cole(Rene Russo),Riggs and Murtaugh look to take down Jack Travers at all costs.Lethal Weapon 3 is fantastic Action film that I always liked since seeing it in 1992/93 especially after loving the first two Lethal Weapons. I can see why some people wouldn't like this one as much as the first two because the first two Lethal Weapon's set the bar so high for Action how do you top those two and where do you go with the franchise. The story for Lethal Weapon 3 Isn't groundbreaking or original by any stretch of the imagination because LW3 follows the same formula of the first two filmsthe hilarious Adventures of Riggs and Murtuagh,lots of Action,a memorable villain and lots of explosions and thrills to satisfy the viewer. With some franchises or film series there is a formula that works and when something works you just don't change it. The film has a great barrel of laughs and humor which is first shown in the beginning of the film which pretty starts off with a big giant bang. It's a great opening that will have you laughing your head off. The characters and the terrific offbeat personalities of Riggs,Murtaugh,Leo and Lorna Cole brings laughs and hilarious dialog just like the second one. While LW3 is a funny film it is also a very emotional film especially with the examination about guns and gang violence and how gang violence or the possession of guns can lead to death. LW3 is also an examination of the great characters of Riggs and Murtaugh and how Murtaugh wants to retire and how it affects Riggs and the relationship he has with Murtaugh while Murtaugh is getting older and wants to retire. This film shows viewers that Riggs and Murtaugh's partnership and relationship is more complex than we thought. What I also love about the film is the addition of the character Lorna Cole as Riggs' love interest because in many respects Lorna is the female version of Riggs like Riggs she loves The Three Stooges,Action and Lorna could be slightly insane like Riggs and that is one of the reasons this film as flawed as it is works because of the chemistry between these two characters and that both characters are pretty much on an even keel when compared to each other. This movie like the other LW films moves at a fast pace and it never slows down once the Action starts and once the Action starts there's non-stop thrills and excitement. The LW films have always been known for great villains and Jack Travis is a great villain because this time instead of being a villain from another country or from the army,Travis is a former cop who is now an arms dealer selling guns and armor piercing bullets that can and will kill cops in a heartbeat and in some ways that make Jack Travers dangerous to not only Riggs and Murtaugh but other cops as well even though he's not as intimidating as the villains in LW1,2 or 4. The Action scenes in this film are great and intense and make the film more suspenseful and insane with great shootouts,explosions and fires all around giving the film a powerful rush. The final 20-30 minutes like the other LW films are great and Action filled and also look at the film and look for the scene after the credits the scene will have you roaring in laughter.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh bringing the same intensity,laughs and chemistry as in the first two. Joe Pesci is fantastic and hilarious once again as fast talking Leo Getz. Rene Russo is great,tough and sexy as Sgt. Lorna Cole,Riggs' love interest. Stuart Wilson does a wonderful job as Jack Travis,the villain of the film. Steve Kahan(Capt. Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainer(Stephanie Woods,Psychachirst),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh),Gregory Miller(Tyrone)and Jason Meshover-Lorg(Young Cop)giver go performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and using great angles while also doing well in the Action scenes. Great direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is effective and intense and goes well with the film. Another great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also great songs by Sting with Eric Clapton(It's Probably Me),Elton John and Eric Clapton(Runaway Train)and Boyz II Men(It's So Hard To Say Goodbye). Great songs.In final word,if you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon franchise,I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 3,a Action-packed,funny and entertaining sequel that's not as good as the first two but you watch again and again with the rest of the series. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.

Lethal Weapon 2 fell short in so many areas (see my review)  Lethel Weapon 3 teams up Gibson and Glover once again and Joe Pesci returns as Leo Gettz, who is now doing real estate among some other odd jobs.  The story is intriguing.  A former rogue cop is helping a bid bad mobster steal guns and drugs from police lock ups around LA.  Together they are pushing the guns into the streets into the hands of kids and gangs.  Lethal Weapon 3 has all the magic that made the first Lethal movie so perfect....of course Riggs and Murtaugh who continue an unbelievable on screen chemistry light the screen and keep us laughing and on the edge of our seat.  Joe Pesci in a DELIGHTFUL turn of events stop being so incredibly annoying to the audience and instead is a perfect dose of comedic relief that is used in moderation as opposed to be completely barraged with his annoying character.  Leo instead annoys Murtaugh and Riggs which is cute and funny and his character is much more enjoyable.  The story line is more simple to understand, and has the heart that Richard Donner usually manages to bring to the story line which is what makes the Lethal films such a unique action experience.  The action is of course EXPLOSIVE...with some great fight scenes, and things exploding all over the place which is always fun when put into the Lethal Weapon context.  Enter a new character....Lorna Cole...the beautiful Internal Affairs (Infernal Repairs as Riggs calls it) agent who is investigating the cop, Jack Travis, who is smuggling the guns out of police lock ups.  Riggs and Lorna immediately spark and they argue and bite at each other back and forth but the admirated and attraction is evident.  Rene Russo is perfect as the tough as nails (I HATE that expression) cop who can hold her own and kick some butt which in turn, turns Riggs crank.  Eventually they give way to their passions and in a very humorous and sexy scene they find themselves in each other's arms.  Murtaugh is on the verge of retirement.  In fact at the beginning of the film he has eight days until finally he gets his retirement.  Instead of spending those eight days relaxing and tying up loose ends, Riggs pulls him into a case of bad cops, and illegal guns.  I must say that Lethal Weapon 3 doesn't exactly carry the Dramatic Heart that Lethal Weapon 1 had with the story line of Riggs wife being murdered, and Riggs being such a loose cannon but certainly it holds it's own with the action and the storyline.  The heart does play a part when Riggs and Murtaugh have an emotional chat on his boat and Riggs tells Roger he doesn't want him to retire because without him, Riggs is not the same.  All in all this is an excellent sequel to a great series.

The story is incredibly simple, standard action material. It's totally uninteresting and also told in a totally uninteresting way. Also the villain is yet again heavily underused. But it's true that none of the Lethal Weapon movies have ever relied on its story. Instead the movie heavily relies on its two main character; Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. And when you have two such characters like Riggs and Murtaugh, who have such an amazing chemistry together, you just don't need much else to make a good and entertaining movie.Unfortunately the movie does nowhere live up to its fantastic and memorable beginning. Everything that happens after the opening sequence isn't really that interesting or memorable. The movie doesn't always have the right pace and the way the story is presented make it seem even less interesting than it is on paper.The movie is filled with some great characters next besides to the two main leads. Joe Pesci returns as Leo Getz and Rene Russo joins the team as a woman who knows how to take care of herself. The villain is this time played by the always great Stuart Wilson. It however is unfortunate that all of these characters are given too little screen time, especially Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. All of the Lethal Weapon movies always had great villains, that were also at the same time always heavily underused. Same goes for Wilson in this particular case, who's talent is practically wasted.But luckily the movie is still of course a perfectly entertaining one. This is absolutely thanks to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who still have the magic chemistry together, after already 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The two of them provide some great and hilarious moments together, that alone is reason enough why this movie is a good and enjoyable one to watch.Maybe not as good- but certainly just as entertaining as all of the other Lethal Weapon movies.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Great fun...","Date":"7 October 2003","Score":"11 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  The signs of aging could shine through in Lethal Weapon 3, but they don't. Because - magically - the series doesn't seem to be aging too much. Why? Because the series is always changing. It is smart, in that it realizes it cannot continue with the cop-buddy action-comedy formula per se, so it almost becomes more of a strict comedy with some big stunt pieces and looney fights. Sure, there's plenty of action, but it's not as fierce of bruising or just downright vicious as in the first two films. When there are fight scenes they seem a bit more corny than before. This is a more lighthearted entry into the series, and though you could say without seeing the film that soft is not what Lethal Weapon is about, just remember how tiring it would have been seeing a repeat of the second and first film.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are back. The film opens with an explosive prelude that has become the symbol of the Lethal Weapon movies (later films such as Bad Boys - another cop-buddy film - tried to use the same technique but, in my opinion, sort of failed).After the opening sequence, in which they try to diffuse a bomb in a parking garage but end up tripping the detonator instead, the two men are demoted from Sergeants to regular cops - they walk the streets in boredom giving out tickets to J-walkers and trying to find a way to have some fun.Murtaugh is bent on retiring - again - in a week. Riggs, now his best-buddy, tries to ignore the fact as best he can by cracking jokes about girdles. (Don't ask.) While walking the streets they come upon an armored van robbery (what are the chances?) and stop the crooks through a windy car chase along a highway, with a reference to The Road Warrior along the way. (And if you don't understand that joke, you don't belong on this site.)Plot revelation upon plot revelation finally builds up into the fact that new weapons are filling the streets - cop killers - that can go right through a bulletproof vest and out the other side. Brought in to investigate into these matters is Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), a woman after Riggs' own heart. She kicks butt, pays no attention to rules, and is a smart...bottom.Also returning is Joe Pesci to the role of Leo Getz. His head full of bleached hair and sporting a nice car, the retired thief is now in real estate, trying to sell Murtaugh's home to interested folk. One of the best scenes is when Getz is taking a couple through Murtaugh's home and mentions all the different accidents they've had over the year, including the car smashing through the wall and accidental bomb damage upstairs. He later says it's illegal to withhold information. And this is coming from the guy who, in Lethal 2, admitted to laundering drug money.Lethal Weapon 3 is full of fun, good intentions, and more fun. For fans of the first two films this is a great relief - it's not nearly as bad as you're expecting it to be. However, there are more than a handful of flaws here. The plot is not nearly as realistic nor intriguing as the first two, the action is a bit too dumbed down at times, and overall the film seems more like a big-budget extravaganza as compared to the smartness of the first two. Still, you really can't go wrong with Lethal Weapon 3, because if you enjoyed the first two, you're going to eat this up.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Massive Drop In Quality","Date":"27 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This is a much watered down Lethal Weapon movie compared to the first two movies.Plot In A Paragraph Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) pursue Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson), a former L.A.P.D. lieutenant turned ruthless arms dealer, during the six days prior to Murtaugh's retirement.

Richard Donner kept Joe Pesci on the cast (who although in the original script was not part of the cast) which I also very much enjoyed seeing Leo Getz run his mouth non-stop. Lethal Weapon 3 to me was more comic filled than any of the others and to me from 1 to 3 it seemed all planned out. Lethal Weapon 4 seemed a little off and more like a lets cash in some more.This movie's plot has our two heroes demoted to walk the street and these guys were so chaotic at the job that it seemed safer keeping them as detectives. In this flick the villain is bold, intelligent and merciless he was a former L.A.P.D. Lieutenant named Jack Edward Travis (Stuart Wilson). Travis is an arms dealer who was running things smoothly till some of his men decided to do something stupid&#x85;, they committed a crime while Murtaugh and Riggs were on the scene.While the investigation was going on, the duo met Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) from internal affairs she is tough smart and happen to be the only woman in the whole series who could handle Riggs. Now the duo now turned trio went all out to bring Travis down.Lethal Weapon 3 was also a commercial success but was received with mixed reviews; again the score was done by the trio Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton, and David Sanborn who also worked on the previous two films.This is my third favorite in the series, but the intro is my top best. Richard Donner did a great job with this characters created by Shane Black, and I just have to give him kudos because this series is one that too me should be left where it is and a remake should not be done or a continuation, as we saw in Die Hard 5, if you drag it you wreck it.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"Formulaic action movie with little surprises within - 69%","Date":"21 December 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Christmas is always a busy time for me - in addition to thinking of presents for my Better Half, work is an unrelenting tide of pressure and drunken revelry to clean up after. So looking for something undemanding in terms of expectation and content, I decided to throw myself back into the Lethal Weapon series with this third entry. And luckily, this followed the exact same template as the second film - namely, retain the same core characters and introduce a few minor tweaks. But for some reason, it doesn't quite work as well as before although this still ticks every box in the action buddy-cop genre book of cliché.Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is now a few days from retirement and his partner, deranged loose cannon Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), seems to be trying to make it a week from hell. After being demoted to patrolmen after Riggs failed to handle a bomb scare properly, the two stumble across a conspiracy to smuggle confiscated weapons from the LAPD. However, Internal Affairs are already on the case with Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) pursuing former cop Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson). But Murtaugh's confidence in his abilities is fast fading with his forthcoming retirement while Riggs' focus switches to the bewitching Cole.So Lethal Weapon 3 offers yet another case for the original masters of mayhem to shoot, punch and blast their way through whilst trading their one-liners and suffering the machinations of comic plot device Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). And on one level, that's fine - it's certainly no different to what happened in the two earlier movies. But the movie is noticeably weaker and blame partly lays with the plot. Wilson isn't a particularly effective villain, especially given that the LAPD know he's the baddie from quite early on and yet he is never recognised when he strolls in to take the guns. Pesci feels much more irritating this time around and the romantic sub-plot feels far-fetched even by the standards of the series. The action looks and feels OK but there is a lot of waffle between set pieces, meaning that the film drags its heels quite a bit towards the inevitable climax. But crucially, it doesn't offer anything you haven't seen a thousand times before and while most action movies rely on the sense of the familiar, that slight sense of excessiveness is what made the first two movies stand out.It's not all bad, though. Gibson and Glover are still an entertaining double act and their banter still has that improvised feel to it, meaning that they feel a lot more believable than most movie cops. Russo is probably the real surprise in a role that could have been simple eye-candy but is actually a valuable member of the cast and contributes more to the film than Pesci does. But I cannot escape the feeling that laurels were being well-and-truly sat on by series helmer Richard Donner, as though the dollars would simply roll in just by being another Lethal Weapon movie. But even without such cynical motives, Lethal Weapon 3 is weaker than the first two movies (Lethal Weapon 4 is still on my To View list) although action fans will probably still get a kick from this deeply formulaic buddy-cop blockbuster. Just don't expect it to blow you away... "}{"Title":"Police Police, Word Word. Am I getting to you? Am I getting to you?","Date":"1 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Many films fall from grace in regards to sequels. Lethal Weapon started very good, got great with #2 and then fell below the first one with the third installment, cleverly titled Lethal Weapon 3.Not that Lethal Weapon 3's all that bad. It's got its comedy, fantastic, though sporadic, action sequences &#x96; always nice to see real action in movies over the CGI world of today, and it's got the chemistry still in place between the two leads Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover.) Unfortunately, what it suffers most from probably one of the most aimless scripts of all time. This film was all over the place, as if the actors were told, via speakerphone because Director Donner had to be on some holiday spending his check he probably received immediately following #2, just do what you want, say what you think and cough it up. That last part nailed my point when one character, the infamous psychologist from the series played by Mary Ellen Trainor either has a cold, or her explanation of her coughing was cut from the final film.Further proving my critique, the movie is about armored piercing bullets, or cop killers, gangs, retirement, filming a movie, a land project, a new romance, an unwanted romance, an ex-cop, sublingual messages again &#x96; SEE the Murtaugh's new dog, selling homes, the internal affairs department, or police police and the word word. And it jumps from one of these to the next without ease, warning or reason. Sure, they get to the point, but mostly it was about the cast reuniting for some more fun, of their own.You'll have fun, too, but at the cost of trying to sort things out. It's best to leave your brain at the door, just sit back and watch the few action scenes, like the enormously irrelevant but exciting explosion that opens the film. The humor's there &#x96; Gibson definitely had it, Glover played a more subdued straight man and Pesci's played his role all over again from #2.This viewing, however, reminded me a lot of the magic I felt when I first watched it, probably a dozen or more times when I was much younger. I forgot some of the lines I've used in real life, like Kelly's pool hall. Kelly speaking. Yep, I've actually answered the phone with that. Or It's the Police, Police. &#x96; I used to work in Quality Assurance, whereas I listened to phone calls of the customer service representatives of my firm and so I called my department the Police, Police. Also, I've used Why? Am I getting to you? Am I getting to you? I guess the trend is, they love to repeat themselves. Word. Word.You could do a lot worse and if you try and jump past the Murtaugh feeling sorry for himself + the funeral scene, both of which took up entirely too much of the picture, you might have some fun. But take heed as humorous and action packed some scenes are, this is a huge step down from #2 but a nice companion. I just wished they knew when to throw in the towel and quit here&#x85; "},{"Title":"Mel Gibson,Danny Glover,Joe Pesci,and Rene Russo","Date":"24 February 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back in action again,as Riggs and Murtaugh,two L.A. cops who were first introduced in the first Lethal Weapon movie.Joe Pesci returns as smart alec Leo Getz,though his role is smaller in this movie.However Rene Russo joins the gang this time around.as for the movie itself,i liked it as much as the second one.there's an exciting chase scene,some great fight scenes,and the movie is funnier than the first two.Not only do Gibson and Glover have their back and forth banter,but so do Gibson and Russo.they have great chemistry together and really work well of each other.the only thing i didn't like that much about this installment was that the story was pretty standard for the genre,and the bad guys were your typical generic,run of the mill crooks.but the performances,the comedy and the chemistry of the actors make up for that.for me,Lethal Weapon 3 is a 7/10 "},{"Title":"Shot for Sport, as Prey, While Jaywalking?","Date":"28 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" While things do have ways of becoming complicated, all by themselves; there's still just enough thought, quite systematically though collusively embodying them, to where the prospect of things becoming uncomplicated, all by themselves, would never be permitted, by any statistically viable measure of effort; save to the extent of such being the only possible solution, or at least the only one potentially required, in its capacity to insure that every vital truth is just as fatally shot in the back! . . . That is, to the virtually categorical exclusion of just as individually and intelligently-systematic-an-attempt to successfully as well as deliberately and even quite forcefully untangle all this sinisterly-underhanded intrigue; with nothing, one could only wish, but the most effective of ex-cop killers, at least in terms of the kind of armor which really needs be officially pierced; while targeting about the only real threat to, just for openers, Second Amendment Rights, in particular, which the NRA would be the very last to confront. . . . Riggs was an extremely slick act, even to those without the eyes to see completely through the loop of such a vitally indispensable parable. Yet, perhaps only because I'm still a lover of Mad Magazine, as well as the only kind of required reading in which I could never really believe; I wish he'd grow back that beautiful mane, despite even the extent to which we'd both love to be able to bypass the Mayhem and Chaos of the past fifty years alone, not to mention various other things which dare no less unjustifiably clash with the most uniformly rank-and-file blues. . . . I do hope it's not merely a false assumption that he is more than the most typically modern kind of Thespian, contrary to the abject probability of an alter-ego whose Greek even most Classically sneaks up from behind; so as to project the mere appearance of a Pathos bordering on the very Razor's Edge of self-absorption, within a Continuum of Being involving nothing but&#151;Involvement&#151;and its redeemingly-transfiguring embodiment of even the most otherwise merely professional forms of detachment as well. . . . As a Christian, of course, I'd have no official authorization to follow the lead of the NRA, assuming it is even consciously let-alone explicitly aware of the implication that its guns would be of any use against the very Institutionalization which so systematically threatens, should I rather say, last, and even least of all, the Second Amendment; even given that the only other conceivable alternative, a reinstatement of even the Second Amendment, on the basis of Due Process, is the most hopelessly futile as well as sanely-reliable alternative. . . . As an American, though, minus any scripturally-prohibitive restraints (which, again, is certainly not the case), I'd be duty-bound, by our very Constitutional Philosophy, to act in the only way left, according to It, upon how systematically I've been denied Official Redress of so many of my more seriously intolerable grievances. But, then, thank God I'm not an American first, particularly given her own logically non-sequitur inversion, when carefully examined, of the real meaning of Separation of Church and State. The trial of Marcellus Gallio (Richard Burton), with Caligula (Jay Robinson) presiding, at the end of The Robe, is more than adequate to help make my meaning here clear; at least for anyone, if anyone, with even the brains, let-alone the will, to distill it! . . . That is, coupled with the kind of Class Warfare, between those relative few for whom society exists, and those many by means of whom it exists, which reduces the NRA to the most tactically-misleading kind of Ornament, along with Emmanuel Goldstein and the so-called liberally American institutions, at the other end of this collusively well-coordinated panorama of equally represented images. Ordinarily, it would be a real dilemma, particularly for a real Christian, over-against the typically professing ones, who compel me to much more meticulously define what I mean, lest I be confused with them, almost as much to their consternation as to that of my own! . . . That is, to decide which constitutes the real law of the land; either the de facto law, the kind only brute force could ever challenge the equally brutal enforcement of, if necessary; or, the very Constitutionally abstract codes, over-against the many layers of which this de facto law at least theoretically should be measured; assuming it is possible to overcome the most endlessly rhetorical debates, in favor of anything more than just as arbitrarily-rhetorical-a-consensus as to the difference, in any particular kind of case. . . . But then, again, it's only in a purely hypothetical sense, at least for purposes of action rather than definition, that such an issue concerns me at all, even as an American; as one, that is, who is duty-bound not to react, in any violently opposing way, to any facet of the de facto law; regardless of how illegal, by any real Constitutional definition, it may happen to be, or may not merely happen to be; as opposed to how even the Riggs in me would sometimes just-as-soon opt to handle the problem, that is, on any normal day! . . .

This opening scene involved Riggs and Murtaugh investigating in a high-risk move....trying to outwit a bomb-laden car in a parking garage of a large marina building before the bomb squad could arrive. It was rigged with a timer which, when it goes down to 0000, would detonate the bomb.As the timer slowly went down, the police duo slowly go into the bomb's intricacies, trying to find the right colored wire to stop the timer. They thought they found the right wire but suddenly the timer speeds up its countdown, and they couldn't stop the timer. They then run out of the building just in time just before the whole bomb blows up the car in a massive explosion---which in turn blows up the whole building, and then the building collapses into smoke and rubble. The duo was then lauded by police for finding the bomb before the bomb squad came in---but they almost got killed doing this heroic deed.Then, as the police duo teams up with Lorna Cole (played by Rene Russo), their adventure involves trying to track down a small renegade of illegal arms smugglers who use armor- piercing bullets to kill cops who think they can outsmart bullets with their bulletproof vests.. I especially like the part when Riggs eventually puts a flashback fire along a trail from an enemy truck carrying the cop-killing ammunition, and when the fire hits the back of the truck, the ammunition goes up explosively into the sky like a botched fireworks display. In the middle of this dangerous mission, Riggs almost has his relationship with Murtaugh severed forever when Riggs gets romantically involved with Lorna. Riggs relationship with Murtaugh also was saved when Riggs tries to teach him the spinning back kick, which fails during a demo at a police station, but instinctively does that kick against one of the renegade members...which he uses to success.One of the stunts I like in the flick was when Riggs used a rope as something like a bungee cord when he ran out of expressway during one of the chase scenes when he was on a motorcycle. He grabs on to the end of the rope to break his fall but not until his bike bursts into flames after about a 200-foot drop of the bike.In the final shootout, Lorna does get shot (probably about 12 times but not with armor- piercing bullets) by one of the assailants, but she lived through it.What made the movie unusual was that after the end-credits were over....there is what I call a post-scene. Very few movies have this. Here, another marina building was cordoned off because, like the beginning of the movie, a bomb was rigged somewhere in the building. A unmarked car carrying Riggs and Murtaugh go past the yellow police do not cross wire marking off the outer perimeter of the building, stopping about 15 feet from the building, and hoped to try to become heroes to try to find the bomb in the building before the bomb squad came in. Murtaugh tells Riggs not to get out of the car, fearing that the bomb could blow at anytime. Ignoring Murtaugh's warning, Riggs gets out of the car on the right side to figure out what correct color of the bomb's wires in order to disarm the bomb until suddenly---BOOM!!!! The whole building blows and Riggs goes back inside and the car backs up and speeds off before the whole building goes down. Like the former, this is another Las Vegas Style explosion---the explosions first, and then the whole building implodes into smoke and rubble....And the movie ends like that. You couldn't believe that Riggs' overconfidence in believing that the already-exploded bomb had mercury switches (which he mentioned in the first Lethal Weapon) almost got him and Murtaugh killed!

Probably the most action-packed but not necessarily lethal injection into this incendiary series, this third entry pulls no punches in delivering repeated doses of explosions and humor to satisfy even the most skeptical of crowds.But they're about to be undone by a third weapon, Lorna Cole (series newcomer Rene Russo), an Internal Affairs investigator who by and large, is a perfect match for the wacko loose cannon Riggs. More on this later. This time out, Riggs is still the hot-headed loner and Roger is still the conservative family man, set to retire in a few days at 52.The opening credits promise us everything with the song It's Probably Me by Eric Clapton and Sting playing in the background, a cigarette is tossed into a pool of gasoline and the camera tracks the flames as a large 3 is outlined with the words Lethal Weapon next to it. Lethal Weapon 3 then opens with the crime-busting duo arriving on the scene of a bomb scare at a building's underground parking garage. To make long stories short, Riggs cuts the red wire and the two (with a cat in tow) are forced to make a run for it as the building comes crashing down in a spectacular demolition.As a result, the two are busted down to patrolmen, citing pedestrians for j-walking and other hassles. They get wind of a robbery in progress and proceed to bust (and I use that term heavily) the perpetrators. This introduces us to Ms. Cole. Apparently, she's on the trail of the mastermind who's been smuggling shipments of armor-piercing ammunition and high-powered automatic weapons from the L.A.P.D. warehouses to street gangs. It all points to a cop, or ex-cop Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson) and his band of ex-con goons who operate out of a housing development just outside the city's borders.Like I said, Lethal Weapon 3 isn't short of explosions, laughs, chases, and a strong chemistry between Riggs and Cole as they come together in a hesitant passion after comparing battle scars. Director Donner (working from the script by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen) keeps the action and story going along at a frantic pace and never slows down. Pipsqueak Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) also returns, now a real estate broker who's trying to sell Murtaugh's home and discloses its sordid history of action-related damage.I guess it's all fun and games, but this entry still showed its tiring out.

While lacking in some parts, particularly Riggs' character (he's over the insanity), there's still a lot to enjoy. The action sequences are of the usual high standard, particularly the armoured-car chase and the subway shoot-out. Steve Kahan does a great job in his elevated role of Captain Ed Murphy, and its great to see him bickering with the bad guy and taking out some of his henchmen rather unconventionally. I always liked his character and am glad they used him more in this one.Danny Glover is a gem as always. He's always been my favourite over Mel Gibson and he has some classic scenes and one-liners.

And it's nice to know they haven't changed...still the same guys we remember.  The story line, to me, is secondary to the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh; that's what keeps me coming back.As far as the additions to the ever-growing cast of characters, I will admit that Leo Getz was a character that I, personally, could have done without in this one, as well as part 2 (though, after LW4, I tend to go a little easier on him...but that's for another review!).  This time, we add a love interest for Riggs, Sgt Lorna Cole.  My hat is off to Rene Russo for creating a character that could actually out-Riggs Riggs! The hardest thing in the world must be for an actor or actress to join an established franchise such as Lethal Weapon and find a way of fitting themselves in.  Lorna Cole is certainly a match for Riggs, in more ways than one!The plot has, of course, been used many times before in other movies, that of learning there may be a bad cop in the ranks.  There were more than enough chases and incidents to keep things moving very nicely, thank you.  About the only complaint I have about LW3 is  ***SPOILER** when Riggs and Murtaugh allow a young cop to tag along with them when they go to investigate the possible theft of more guns.  Surely Internal Affairs would not have allowed something like that, but I realize that they needed someone to prove that the bad guys did, indeed, have cop killers...and did not want to lose a character they wanted to keep around for LW4.  Still, it didn't seem to fit in with the way Riggs, Murtaugh and Cole typically would operate.  ***End of SPOILER***In the end, Lethal Weapon 3 delivers everything we have come to expect from the franchise.

Riggs also has to contend Internal Affairs officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) while Murtaugh only has a week left before retirement.Almost abandoning the emotional development of the characters as portrayed in the preceding two movies &#145;Lethal Weapon 3' is more of a straight out action flick with much more comedy to be found. While the previous two instalments had often dark overtones to them &#145;Lethal Weapon 3' is a much lighter and less thought provoking movie. Though the established friendship between Riggs and Murtaugh is marvellously shown during a touching scene on Murtaugh's boat the movie lacks some of the great characteristics that the previous movies possessed. Nonetheless &#145;Lethal Weapon 3' is enjoyable if taken as a straight action flick. Rene Russo is an interesting addition to the cast and the relationship that develops between herself and Riggs is almost reminiscent (to some extent only) of the way the Riggs/Murtaugh relationship developed in the original, though much faster. Joe Pesci in the role of Leo Getz provides some outstanding comedy scenes just as he did in &#145;Lethal Weapon 2'.The action sequences are generally exciting and enjoyable and the final action scenes are my personal favourites of the series. With the lack of character development in this movie it is clear that director Richard Donner decided that more action was required to make up for it and therefore almost from the very beginning the viewer is treated to spectacular explosions, gunfights and some good car chases. There is rarely a dull moment and though perhaps there was an overabundance of comedy interwoven into the storyline all in all &#145;Lethal Weapon 3' remains a very pleasing movie.If you're an action fan or an admirer of the first two &#145;Lethal Weapon' movies then this is worth checking out. Despite the plot not being as intricate as the original the movie is in some ways more enjoyable though in some ways it was also poorer. Great action, solid direction, pleasing acting and a fun story makes &#145;Lethal Weapon 3' a movie that I recommend! My rating for &#145;Lethal Weapon 3' &#150; 7/10.

Sargents Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh have returned. The story opens at a big building where a bomb is said to be planted. The boys don't want to wait for the bomb squad so they go investigate. The bomb is in a car. Riggs figures he can cut a wire and defuse the bomb. He performs the task unsuccessfully and they both race out of the building second before it's blown to pieces!         Murtaugh is going to retire soon and to add sheer insult to injury, he and Riggs were demoted to patrolman. They wore officer uniforms and walked the streets. They wanted to cite a jay walker but couldn't figure out how to make out a ticket. There's an attempted armored car robbery. Riggs jumps on the bad guys' stolen armored car and Murtaugh follows with Officer Dolores in the other one. The attempted robbery is foiled.         Joe Pesci is back as Leo Getz! Leo is now in real estate and since the Murtaugh house is for sale, Leo tries to sell it.        An evil organization is selling illegal firearms. Even to young adults and teenagers. Murtaugh's son, Nick, is friends with a few of those people. (the young adults and teens getting guns sold to them). The evil operation is lead by former LAPD detective Jack Edward Travis. He even assassinates one of his caught henchmen at the police station. Murtaugh and Riggs meet Sgt. Lorna Cole, who's as spunky as they are. She finds out more about the operation. Leo even says he knows Travis and his men from one time when he went for a job interview. They go to the hockey area where Leo get's shot, but it's only a flesh wound. At the hospital, Riggs and Murtaugh figure they gotta keep Leo away from danger, so they have him stay for two additional days. Then they go to a burger joint and have a run-in with a few young gangsters with the firearms. Murtaugh takes down one of them, but the one he killed was his son's best friend, Daryl.       Murtaugh disappeared and Riggs went over to Lorna's house. They fell for each other like a ton of bricks. They even have their own series of scars. Riggs even eats a few dog biscuits, because he's trying to quit smoking. (Note In Mad Max, Mel Gibson's character ate dog food to stay alive).         Soon Leo get's out of the hospital and gives a speech why the hospital isn't good. It's alot like his drive-thru speech. He tells Riggs and Murtaugh (back from grieving on his boat) about Travis' operation in the desert real estate. There's a mad chase on the freeway and soon Lorna, Riggs and Murtaugh head out there, destroy Travis and his operation, and save the city again!                 This film was as good as the first two. Lot's of action and stuff. Following the credits was another scene of Murtaugh and Riggs going to the scene of a bomb. The building explodes when they get out of the car, and then pull away before anyone sees them.

This Lethal Weapon has a very painful story, with a harsh reality to it and will prove that being a cop has its ups and downs.They're back in their most successful, most explosive, most hilarious smash hit yet. They come, they see, they kick butt in a caper that has L.A. police detectives Riggs and Murtaugh ripping into a vicious crime ring dealing guns to the streets. Shady ex-mob accountant Leo Getz returns, and add the lethal kick of Internal Affairs investigator Lorna Cole, like Riggs is a born risktaker. Risk are everywhere in Lethal Weapon 3, which isn't just more of everything. It's the most!Lethal Weapon 3's story is a pretty good one. Having bad guys hand out guns on the streets would have to happen all the time and I feel Lethal Weapon 3 brought the true reality of this to the bigscreen. The first two movies have effected Riggs the most, but this time we get to see the emotional side of Murtaugh as the job starts to really takes its toll on him. In the end finishing this job becomes a personal vendetta for Murtaugh. While we still get to see the crazy antics of Riggs, who would give anyone a heart attack from working with him, and Leo Getz who is still a pain in the ass.I want to give praise to Rene Russo. She is a beautiful lady, but yet changes that girl look to be come Lorna Cole, a very lethal and explosive cop, who is a refreshing face to a classic genre. The fighting stunts in this Lethal weapon weren't bad either, With Lorna Cole proving she isn't a cop to be messed with. Rene has had a pretty good career with films including the remake of the Thomas Crown Affair, Ransom (again alongside Mel Gibson) and her most recent film being the movie length version of The adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. If Lethal Weapon did not get to see her, it would have been a great shame.Some of the scenes in this Lethal Weapon are just typical of this series. The start is the most explosive of all the films, and really shows how good Glover and Gibson are onscreen . The armoured guard chase was very funny, Riggs risking his neck to save the day, and Murtaugh becoming rather friendly with a very lively female guard driver. It was crazy this scene and I couldn't help but laugh at it. When Riggs also decides to go on a bike rampage over L.A. and plunges 80 feet of a freeway, it is breathtaking to watch. Yet the most funniest scene in this would have to be when we get to see Leo Getz out of the hospital, this scene had me in stitches. Plus, when see Riggs trying  to win over the guard dog, it is completely stupid but very funny.This Lethal Weapon is my least favourite of the first three movies, because  something was missing. I only had to look in the video store a few days later to see that Lethal Weapon 4 was here and that this popular cop saga might go down as the one of the best in Hollywood's history.Rating 3 Stars or 7/10  "},{"Title":"Ranked #2","Date":"23 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Unlike most others, I actually think the Leathal Weapon movies improve with each sequel - thus #4 is the best and #1 is the least good.

But the film is more of a comedy than anything, with a very funny dialogue and some details that raises the film above its prequels. Notably the entire first half hour of the film is VERY funny at times, especially when Riggs and Murtaugh get acquainted with Lorna Cole. A fun film, not very smart - but very fun.

Who came up with this guy? Did the screenwriters even look at the first two movies. Gary Busey in the first movie he's a real badass and he's cool too. The germans in LETHAL WEAPON 2 are also fantastic. That chubby boss really got on my nerves and Adolf was mean as hell. We're talking carisma. Those bad-guys from the first two made me angry! I got so p****d on them, I'm still angry. They kidnapped Murtaugh's daughter, had salt in his wounds, gave Riggs electric shocks, killed Murtaugh's vietnam'buddy's daughter, the german's were even worse. They killed both Riggs' wife and Rika, and Adolf was coward enough to throw a throwing knife in Riggs' leg before he started the fight. When Riggs ripps down the stilt-house I was cheering and jumping up and down in salvation. Now of course, I wanted such a scene in LETHAL WEAPON 3. Never came...No matter how hard I tried I never got angry on this guy. Not even when Riggs burned the place down, or when the guy shoot Lorna. He was just so boring. I mean, he got scared when the police got to the hockey arena. I mean, what would mr. Joshua had done in a situation like that? Just wondering.Other reasons is the flat script and that the rawness was gone. The end-fight was pitiful when you compare it to the ones in LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON 2. This movie simply isn't brutal enough. Why, oh why couldn't Shane Black write a Lethal 3 to make the same feeling appear. The rawness, the humor, the smart jokes, Murtaugh's problem-jokes (the gurdle, come on!), the badguys, the good guys, everything. And wasn't Martin Riggs supposed to be a lethal weapon.

This time, a slimy ex-cop is stealing specialized weaponry that is supposed to be destroyed by the police and giving it back to young street thugs. Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case along with Internal Affairs cop Lorna Cole, who suspects the duo of foul play. But not long after, Cole and Riggs are all over each other.

Rene Russo plays Cole, who is more than a match for Riggs, and of course the stunts and action in the movie are spectacular. The motorcycle chase with Riggs and the inferno finale are some of the highlights.

Who could blame those involved for milking it for all it was worth if the paying public demanded it eh? Made for $35 million, part 3 went on to make Worldwide $321 million, thus ensuring that a part 4 was inevitable. But is Lethal Weapon 3 actually any good? Was the loyal paying public rewarded for their time?.Well yes, chances are that if you were already a fan of the series then this does deliver all you wanted and hoped for. Director Richard Donner and his team of writers shrewdly cottoned on to the basic fact that the ante had to be raised. It's a pretty light plot in truth, but enter more explosions, more action and make Riggs more comically reckless than usual, well it's a successful formula; even if Riggs and Murtaugh are now in essence just a comedy double act. Into the mix comes karate-kicking Internal Affairs female sergeant Lorna Cole a more than agreeable turn from Rene Russo, who simultaneously gives Riggs more scope for gags and a love interest, and love him or hate him, Joe Pesci again pops in with mirth as the whiny Leo Getz. Stuart Wilson gets to play the bad guy with relish, and to show it's not all about slam bangery and japes, the film also boasts having an affecting strand about kids with guns on the streets; and of course the scum who put those guns in those hands.It's all very simple and disposable in the world of the popcorn actioner, and yeah! it's not as good as what came before it in the series, but it's still an entertaining night in regardless. 7/10 "},{"Title":"The weakest entry in the Lethal Weapon franchise is still pretty funny","Date":"13 March 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Director Richard Donner's Lethal Weapon 3 qualifies as a sloppily-scripted, slam-bang actioneer with all the subtlety of a brick through a plate glass window. Nevertheless, if you aren't too picky about its problems, Lethal Weapon 3 can be a lot of fun to watch. Mel Gibson reprises his role as the looney Sgt. Martin Riggs along with Danny Glover as his partner Sgt. Roger Murtaugh. When the movie opens, we learn that Murtaugh has eight days to go before he retires from the LAPD. Staying alive that long around his crazy partner, Sgt. Murtaugh realizes, will take a miracle.Lethal Weapon 3 desperately needs more than a miracle. What is needs is a good plot and a villain you can love to hate. The second sequel in this entertaining police series as not as potent as its predecessors. If anything, Lethal Weapon 3 is a third less filling. Lethal Weapon 2 scenarist Jeffrey Boam appears to be running low on fresh ideas. He looks like he borrowed the plot from the 1974 John Sturges' movie McQ, with John Wayne. This time around the bad guy is a dirty, ex-cop selling contraband machine guns to black street gangsters so as to encourage white families to migrate from the suburbs to the desert sands where he's erecting a new housing development.Stuart Wilson of No Escape plays Jack Travis as a despicable, audacious, greedy, no-holds-barred bad guy. Compared with psycho villain Gary Busey in the original Lethal Weapon or urbane Joss Ackland as the South African politician Arjen 'Aryan' Rudd with diplomatic immunity in Lethal Weapon 2, Wilson is a bad guy, not an S.O.B. When Riggs finally ices him, you don't feel like leaping to your feet and applauding his demise like Ackland's death in Lethal Weapon 2.Donner substitutes gags for gunplay. You spend more than half of the time laughing at the jokes than ducking the bullets. In the opening gambit, Riggs and Murtaugh fudge with a bomb and flatten an entire building. As the dust and debris settle, the bomb squad arrives. No, our heroes aren't booted off the force. Instead, they are demoted to wearing uniforms and walking a beat. While they're in uniform, they spot a bogus armored car and thwart a robbery. Riggs stumbles onto deadly red armored piercing bullets that can penetrate a bullet-proof vest as if it were Kleenex. Suddenly, the guys find themselves up to their eyes in a classified Internal Affairs investigation headed by newcomer Rene Russo as Lorna Cole. Finally, the Teflon-coated Riggs meets his female match. Russo is a tough-as-nails karate chopping detective with the scars to prove it. The movie's best scene has Riggs and Cole comparing their scars and bullet holes. That's the problem with Lethal Weapon 3, there is no nail-gun scene like in Lethal Weapon 2 or the suicide jump in Lethal Weapon.The third time certainly is not the charm for the guys here. Nothing truly memorable happens. Joe Pesci returns as motor-mouthed Leo Getz, but he spends most of his time running off-screen errands or literally being the butt of Gibson's jokes. The movie takes a sobering turn when Murtaugh has to kill a 15-year old black gang member who was his son's friend. Murtaugh launches a personal crusade to track down Jack Travis, not only because he is selling guns to minors but also marketing cop-killer slugs. The final third of the action is one long chase, first through the L.A. subway onto the L.A. freeway, and evening into Travis' half-built housing complex. Donner, who helmed the first two Lethal Weapon movies as well as Superman and The Omen, is no slouch when it comes to action scenes. Although Lethal Weapon 3 is a letdown, you won't know it while you're watching its madcap action. Donner supercharges the pace with so much kinetic energy that you forget that it's all been done before. The freeway chase here is straight out of William Friedkin To Let & Die In L.A with fewer vehicles on the road.The best thing about Lethal Weapon 3 is the chemistry between Gibson and Glover. They learn this time out how inseparable they are as partners. Gibson is just as nutty here as he was in the previous Lethal Weapon movies. Glover tries to break his partner of his cigarette habit by getting him to eat doggie biscuits. Turns out that Riggs likes the doggie biscuits and cannot get enough of them. Part of the problem with Lethal Weapon 3 is that neither Gibson nor Glover ever appear to be in jeopardy. You cannot worry about the heroes catching lead if you're laughing your butt off.Nevertheless, for all its faults, Lethal Weapon 3 is a lot of fun. If you can suffer through the lengthy end credits, Donner and company have a hilarious joke for you.

While LW2 was a largely empty film run on the age-old formula of guns, explosions, profanity, and griping banter, LW3 tries to improve by throwing in some emotional contexts and mild urban commentary to add depth.  It doesn't work...Everything possible in this movie is referential, whether the car chases, the Black urban gangsta stereotypes, the white villain stereotypes as before in the series, the shootouts stolen mostly from Die Hard 2 (which, for that matter, were inspired by John Woo), and the car chases that are more in resemblance to The Blues Brothers than The French Connection.Richard Donner is a very stagnant visual director, considering he used the same director of photography as McTiernan did on Die Hard.  I am beginning to wonder now whether or not Joel Silver started seriously mucking things up for the series rather than Donner self-destructing.  Many similarities can be drawn from the opening scene alone involving a bomb and Jan De Bont's directorial debut, Speed.  I can see how this was his last turn as DoP, but Black Rain remains his best work IMHO.  I can see, in the anti-climatic motorcycle freeway chase how many similar camera styles were used by Frankenheimer in his later years.  This is not a movie about itself, it's a movie about other movies.  Mad Max 2, Jaws, Dirty Harry, A Better Tomorrow, Die Hard, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Beverly Hills Cop, and a lot more.This movie and Terminator 2 receive judgment for trying to make an early-90s look on LA life in an action film.  Neither one is great watching, both try to have elaborate appearances that are hollow...unfinished housing developments.  Notice how here Donner tries making himself look like the politically-correct wiseguy with his not-so-subtle hints against animal cruelty and smoking, yet this is almost as sexist as the second film.  80s movies are in search of money, 90s movies want money and PC agendas. Greed is good, but it begets stupidity.Overall, the sequels in this franchise stink.  I can't say I recommend them anymore than the waves of summer action movies we've had in the last few years.  Interesting how the series goes from Christmas time in the original to any ol' time of year in the sequels.  Die Hard had the same problems. So much for the holidays... 2 out of 5 stars.

It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us. The comedy was educated, intelligent and expertly-delivered. The characters were lovable, and we got the feeling that we knew them, cared about them, wanted them to succeed. Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person, due to the high-level of development his character received. True, the gun handling left a lot to be desired, but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip. Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid. That aside, this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value. One of the best of its kind.2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz. Because of Getz, I honestly found this film to be rather endearing. Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series. Unfortunately, the edge and freshness is toned down way too much, and the action is really rather predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, and was not in the least bored with that aspect. It is still a good movie, even though its edge is shelved for a more marketable product.3 - is just as good as 2. Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well. It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover/Gibson signing for 4 & 5, so it seems the series has wound down, rather than up. The action is still quality, though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments. The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired. And while the performances are still professional, it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out.4 - is the perfect ending to this series. Honestly. The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct, Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring, and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore. (Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming Indiana Jones 4.) Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old, and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's over-used line, I'm getting too old for this sh*t. It is far beyond that. And now, with Riggs's marriage to Lorna, Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters, the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending...enough is just enough.5 - should never happen. I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two. The characters we all loved are already gone. Like in Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, they've been stolen from us. The edge from Riggs's character is gone. He's a bit hapless now, and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character.The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character, the baby AND Butters. Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2, or don't bring him out of the moth balls. PLEASE. I loved these movies, but for the love of Mike! NO MORE!If you liked any of these movies, I highly recommend Tango & Cash, an excellent, much-overlooked, highly under-rated Buddy-Cop movie.1. 9.2/102. 8.8/103. 7.6/104. 6.8/10 from...the Fiend .

They helped set up the formula but by the third film ended up falling into it's own traps making it the weakest the series.After years working together Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is eight days from retirement. But after messing up a bomb disposal, Murtaugh Sgt. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) are demoted to patrolmen where they stop a robbery of an armoured car. This leads them getting involved with an investigate led by tough cookie Internal Affairs officer Sgt. Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), investigating ex-officer Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson), selling automatic gun and armour-piercing bullets.There is a decent idea for a plot, corrupt cops selling powerful weapons from the police evidence. It was done in a realistic way in American Gangster where the police sold drugs to dealers. But Lethal Weapon 3 does take a more ridiculous route, with the main baddie just going into a police station to kill a guy and kidnapping a senior police officer. The film also falls into it's own clichés (which the Simpsons end up making fun), with Murtaugh taking more risks despite being on the edge of retirement, Murtaugh and Riggs being demoted, Riggs and Cole having a hostile relationship before having sex, more over the top action sequences and looking for the smallest excuse for an action sequence. The film's humour was weaker, with Gibson's Three Stooges stick getting old and Joe Pesci's performance as an obnoxious real estate agent was very obnoxious not funny (he is so much better playing sociopathic Mafia hit-man in Martin Scorsese films). The film's attempt to be dramatic also felt forced and the main villain, Travis lacked menace to the villains of the other Lethal Weapon films.But whilst there are weaknesses in the film, there are some merits. Russo was very convincing as a tough, kick-ass woman, and well, I enjoy seeing women beating up men. There is still good chemistry between Glover and Riggs and Richard Donner does know how to direct an action sequence. As stated there is a good basis for a plot, with a real issue about cop killer bullets. It is still a well made movie.Overall Lethal Weapon 3 is the weakest series, but it is still an okay film when watching it with the other three films.

The car chases and shoot-outs look good and there's some nice roughness in them but the fast and dull editing wrecks the scenes a lot. So in the end the film is mainly about the characters, the humorous dialog and the grooving soundtrack.

The original film and its first sequel always had an element of comedy to go with the gritty action, but in this third instalment the humour is brought to the fore (and the nastiness toned down); the result is absolutely cringe-worthy, as tough cops Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) are regularly turned into incompetent clowns for the amusement of a younger demographic.From the opening scene in which Riggs stupidly attempts to diffuse a bomb with disastrous results, to the end credits sequence in which Riggs, clearly having not learnt his lesson, considers diffusing yet another bomb, Lethal Weapon 3 is an embarrassment to the action genre. Jeffery Boam, who did such a good job with Part 2, completely screws up here, his plot being predictable and dull and the characters frequently acting against type just for laughs. Worse still, Boam brings back shifty Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), making him even more obnoxious and irritating than before.Once again, Riggs is given a love interest&#x97;internal affairs cop Lorna Cole (Rene Russo)&#x97;but this chapter being a tamer affair aimed at the whole family, she doesn't get a sex scene (thankfully sparing the viewer yet another Mel Gibson ass shot) and doesn't wind up swimming with the fishes like poor old Patsy Kensit's Rika; instead, Lorna joins in with the crime-fighting fun, proving to be as handy with her fists and guns as the guys.

But at least Riggs and Murtaugh were still Lethal Weapons, THAT was the whole point in the films being so called right? Lethal Weapon 3 might as well have been called 'Inoffensive Family Friendly Safety Weapon'. There is hardly any action in this and what action there is is nothing more than very, very boring and unimaginative gunfights. There is not a drop of blood and without the not so abundant f-word there is no reason for this not to be a PG-13.The bad guy is weak. I'm not kidding you there. His ultimate goal is not world-domination or to seize control of the drug cartels or holding the government hostage. No, Mr Lethal Weapon 3 Bad Guy wants to...build a housing estate. Well, if that ain't the most vilest of all evil plans I've heard of. Sheesh, what a bad man, he truly deserves to die.The lame plot about the stolen guns is a thin excuse for Richard Donner's anti-NRA propaganda (he used to be a member but turned his back on them in disgust around this point). As well-intentioned as this may be, it doesn't belong in a film called Lethal Weapon, especially when you consider the gun violence in the 2 previous movies.They try to make it funny, into an action-comedy. But it's absolutely rancid. The witless, irritating dialogue is overwritten and annoying and Joe Pesci's character is in desperate need of a slap. What is with the blonde hair and earring? A lot of this film could have been cut down, at 121 minutes the anorexic plot long outstays its welcome. There are just so many pointless scenes and distractions. The subplot about Murtaugh (the character is supposed to be 55 but Glover was only 44) retiring is just done to death and it's so slow. What is this? Some family drama? And am I the only one who's noticed that EVERY character says 'sonofabitch' about a million times in this film. Plus Danny Glover shouts 'RIGGS' every 5 seconds. And don't even get me started on Michael Kamen's rubbish score. The saxophone thing totally overbears on every scene and becomes highly distracting. And when he's not using this completely inappropriate sound he's nicking music from his own Die Hard score.It's because of movies like this that Last Action Hero got made.The new 'Director's Cut' DVD presents the film in 2.351 anamorphic widescreen with a faultless picture. The Dolby/DTS 5.1 soundtrack is loud and forceful but hardly dynamic. There are no interesting features (not that I care). The R1 DVD comes in a horrid snapper case but the R2 is a sturdy keepcase.

I vaguely remember promising to lend it to my sister, well she can keep it for all I care because it is not one of those movies that I really desire to have in my collection.The story is simple. An ex-cop, Jack Travis, is stealing weapons and ammunition from police store houses and selling them. Myrtal (Danny Glover) kills a friend of his son when while being shot at, and armour piercing ammo is on the streets. There is little in the way of holding the story together and it seems that it is just endless action without a strong story. Pursuing Jack Travis does take a major part of the movie, but that major part does not make a smooth plot. Rather it seems to me more of an excuse to have numerous action scenes in differing styles.One of the more subtle ideas in the movie is the re-emergence of the macho man over the strong woman. Lorna Cole (Rene Ruso) is an internal affairs agent who is tough and happens to run across Sergant Riggs (Mel Gibson) and the movie falls into a struggle between Riggs and Cole. There is the subtle desire within Riggs character that being the male he must always be dominant over the female, and this is seen in the scene where he brings Cole into the male toilets to talk. This idea of male dominance comes out even more in the scene where they are comparing scars. The whole concept evolves around the desire for the male to emerge once again as the dominant sex while the female sex is fighting to take that role. In the end the female is not forced back into the role of the house-wife, but rather as the man's servant. She is welcome to take on stronger roles as long as the man is always superior.I cannot remember the first two Lethal Weapons but I find that Lethal Weapon 3 is quite average and only worth a side comment.

Where once there was substance there is now nothing but chase and second unit material; where once there was a sense of character, now there is a series of sequences which would once open a James Bond film before giving way to narrative and espionage although now prop up meagre action/adventure flicks. If we liked the first Lethal Weapon, then we liked it for its depiction of a man with a reason to live stuck in a profession that often saw him close to death getting lumped with a fellow cop who felt he HAD no reason to live. It was quite funny, often even touching, and made with a correct ethic that saw it know when to have fun and when the second unit stuff wasn't the primary focus. Lethal Weapon 3 teams these two up for more excitement and adventure, excitement and adventure which is no longer exciting and hasn't really got anything fresh in it to have it feel like it's much of an adventure.We've been down the route of crooked cops; African American gun crime and good looking Internal Affairs agents enough times to know the drill by now, and yet at its heart is that twosome of Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) - that indelible combination which works so much more than it has any right to. Be angry at the film if you must, but reserve a place in your good books for this duo of L.A.P.D. Sergeants, two guys who get the job done in 'book' fashion if 'book' fashion is defined as to jot down exactly what you're about to do as you charge to the crime scene in your police cruiser. They're not hardened enough to be Eastwood's Callaghan, but they are hardened enough not to resemble Jacques Clouseau. Here, we welcome them into their latest escapade via a bomb threat &#x96; back when domestic terrorism in the United States could still be treated as if one, big joke in the year's biggest action movie.Their clashing natures are established through how either of them figure one should go about dealing with such a thing, an explosive device located in the ground floor car park of an office building. Riggs, being who he is, decides to charge in ahead of the bomb squad &#x96; something which results in the whole structure coming down and both men demoted. The problem here, of course, is with Riggs' behaviour. In the first film, doing what he does here was fine, since he was suicidal; a risk taker, a gambler &#x96; he wanted to die on the job because he didn't have the guts to kill himself. Following the culmination of the first film, with Riggs essentially becoming 'cured' of his grief and suicidal thoughts, he shouldn't be attempting these zany ideas at police work. Then there is Murtaugh a black, suited individual to Riggs' scrawnier white fella'; a man who is STILL on the brink of retirement and is on even thinner ice than before in regards to his family who're nervous that he's been busted down to street work in the uniform on the street of L.A. It is, however, whilst on this street patrol that they uncover what will become their latest assignment.The narrative here involves another ex-cop dun-wrong, a man named Jack Travis (Wilson) who's gone rouge and made a fortune out of selling weapons formerly belonging to that of the police force to street thugs who're itching to get their hands on one. Travis works under a façade of housing development construction, something really handy when the time comes to rid his enterprise of someone who lets him down when one spots that small stretch of inconspicuous ground used to funnel the cement out of the truck mixer. While the goals of both Travis and Gary Busey's villain from the first film are similar, Travis is a bad guy cut more from 'stock' than one would have liked and doesn't carry the effective threat really required.As was with the last film, a piece weaving into its proceedings the item of Apartheid rule in South Africa that was still prominent at the time, some sort of strand on African American gun crime, and how easy it is for youngsters of this ilk to fall into such a thing, is present in the narrative. Unfortunately, it is done so with a sense of uneasy grace more so caressed into the story with a consummate hand. Both films want you to leave the piece with a newfound sense of awareness on a topic, but the weight of this latter issue is as such out of its clumsy presence than its deep, affective and residing poise. Again, the decision to essentially put these two characters up against such a thing (in the form of someone instigating this gun crime) is too easy and clutters the film where a different director not looking to pull such obvious sociological punches with this premise might've made better. The film is too easy; too slick for its own good, there's an oiled arrogance to it which is never omnipresent enough for it to be truly agitating, but it's enough to warrant taking against the film overall. It's undemanding and buoyed by whatever decent second unit material it has, but so was the first entry and that seemed capable of a whole lot more than 3 ever musters up.

Murtaugh is full of guilt and scotch. Both have a poignant discussion that gradually turns into an argument when Murtaugh, six days from retirement, wished 'the accident' happened to anyone but him, Riggs understands Murtaugh's point and blames him for his selfishness. Not only he's selfish because he wishes the worst for his best friend, but he doesn't realize that his retirement would prevent Riggs from the only family he ever had. The two cops fight, end up in the water, and the scene is concluded by a hilarious punch-line. I won't spoil it but it easily is one of the top ten smartest quotes of the franchise, and when Riggs and Murtaugh laugh their ass out, we're with them at 100%.After one hour, we finally have the the kind of scene that Lethal Weapon 3 was desperately needing, with an intense level of human emotions, a ferocious energy that grabs your heart to the screen and give your faith back on the whole series. The moment I described is definitely in the same vein that the first and second film, but as whole Lethal Weapon 3 is not in the same league than its glorious predecessors, two action films so great I still can't determine which one is better. It's a pity really because Riggs and Murtaugh are great cinematic characters and their relationship deserved a better story. It's also a pity because the opening scene involving a bomb to defuse, is smart, well-written, and funny, with the perfect conclusion.But somewhere, the film failed to capture the charm and the originality of the series.. And I loved the boat scene precisely because it was one of the closest scenes that could provide an interesting antagonism between Riggs and Murtaugh, and it would have probably enriched the series in terms of character's development. The movie had many possibilities for Gibson and Glover, they could have been assigned new partners, there could have been a reason to suspend their friendship, I don't know, anyway, if they have to stay together, then something new and fresh had to come up from the script, and following the same standards of quality than the first two films. I guess this was the idea behind Rene Russo's character, an Internal Affairs sergeant who's as tough and aggressive as Riggs.I never bought the seemingly chemistry growing between them, I didn't believe a woman like Lorna Cole would be a good match for the Riggs I knew. And even Riggs was sometimes played out of character, just to create a superficial complementary with Lorna Cole. Maybe I'm prejudiced but I never liked Russo in the film and it was the one that made me discover the series. At least, the romance in Lethal Weapon 2 served a plot point and had a genuine quality but Lethal Weapon 3 didn't make it as touching and appealing. The scene when they start comparing their scratches and scars had nothing of the heart-warming complicity between Riggs and Rika. Besides, what makes directors so sure that a woman using karate stuff is cool. I know it's a device that used to be popular 20 years ago, but if there is one thing you expect from LW is originality.I have nothing against bad-ass female characters, but how about a real change, how about making a female bad-ass villain for instance? I'm saying this because that's another department where the film fails a good villain, and this is probably the most unforgivable move. All right I can buy the whole malevolent scheme that consisted on arm-dealing, with a new generation of 'cop-killers' bullets that can pierce even bullet-proof vest, it's menacing, scary and proved to destroy young people, but all that for a real-estate swindling? Well, on its own, it's not that bad an idea, and it's still creepy to see a man drown in cement, but at the end of the film, I had an overdose of action sequences set in building sites. It provided very cheap-looking settings to the film and a frustrating one-note impression as if the writers really lacked imagination.I know the film isn't supposed to reinvent the wheel, but when it doesn't feature archetypes, it's too silly to be believable. We know that the guys who screwed up the job will not get a second chance, and will probably get killed in the most cold-blooded way just to give an example of how vile and bad he is, you would wonder why they never take the next train to Miami and simply vanish instead of coming back 'as if nothing happened'. You'd also wonder, why would a cop made hide himself from cameras if he took the chance to show himself. Why would Riggs ask a rookie if he had protection if he knows that the bullets are cop-killers? Naturally, we all know what would happen to him, and when Lorna Cole is shot, she won't have the same fate than another female partner in the Dirty Harry series. We're always one step ahead of the characters.Lethal Weapon 3 seems to follow the usual pattern and cliché of action-packed films and the sad thing is that many of them were initiated by the series. Joe Pesci as Leo Getz played a comic relief with nothing much to do, except than being annoying. Riggs and Murtaugh's interactions save the day, but the way I see Lethal Weapon 3, it features exactly what one would have feared from Lethal Weapon 2, a sequel that doesn't bring anything new and where what is new isn't even exciting. It's just as if the team capitalized on the series' popularity and knew the film wouldn't fail. The legal minimum is here it's good enough not to disappoint the hardcore fans, but not that ambitious to create something that could have been regarded as one of the best trilogies.

Back when these films were first released, I was too young to see them. Over a decade has passed since the last one came into theatres, and I would have been old enough to see the films years ago, but had never heard of them at the time. After I watched 1 & 2 for the first time this year, and was impressed with both of them, I watched this next one. I figured there would be a good chance that Lethal Weapon 3 would be inferior to both of its predecessors, which it is. I found that the film started off well, and I thought it might be at least as good as the first sequel, but it kind of loses it along the way.Sergeant Roger Murtaugh is due to retire in eight days, but is headed for another dangerous mission with his partner, Sergeant Martin Riggs! The two of them foil an armored truck robbery and arrest one of the robbers, Billy Phelps. Afterwards, the criminal is soon found murdered in the interrogation room, and a hidden camera shows that the murderer is brutal former L.A.P.D. Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis! Murtaugh and Riggs are joined in the investigation by Internal Affairs Sergeant Lorna Cole, a tough policewoman with great fighting skill, whom Riggs quickly falls in love with. The mission is made more complicated after Murtaugh kills an armed gangster who turns out to be Darryl, a close friend of Murtaugh's son, Nick! Because of this, the veteran cop spirals into depression and begins to avoid his family and work.This third installment in the quadrilogy starts of well and humorously, with Riggs trying to dismantle a car bomb, scaring Murtaugh with his daring moves. The humour continues after this. Joe Pesci reprised his role as Leo Getz, from the second film, for this one. While some viewers find him annoying, I think he's pretty funny, and definitely provides some of the humour. There's also some suspense in this film, like its two predecessors (though maybe not quite as much), and some sad scenes with Murtaugh feeling guilty about killing Darryl. However, this third film also has more major flaws than the first two. The main villain is not all that memorable, the plot is a bit bland, and there's some poor dialogue, such as a lame joke about PMS. Lorna Cole, played by Rene Russo, also leads to some problems. Russo doesn't put on a very good performance as this character (she can be a tad irritating, and seems a little too smug), the romance between Cole and Riggs is cheesy, and the new character basically steals the show.Sequels are usually less popular than their predecessors, and the Lethal Weapon sequels are no exception. I was impressed with the original 1987 blockbuster when I saw it several months ago, and found the second one to be slightly inferior when I saw it just last week, but still pretty good. Both of those movies left me satisfied, but that wasn't quite the case with Lethal Weapon 3. Around the beginning, I was impressed. Towards the end, I was not. The movie suffers from certain problems that its two predecessors don't suffer from, especially Rene Russo stealing the show, sometimes making it seem like Lorna Cole is replacing Riggs and Murtaugh as the star. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make a great pair as the two stars in the series, and did not need to be upstaged, especially not by someone who puts on an inferior performance. So, for several reasons, mainly that one, it isn't the quite same here as it was before.

Yes, this is the same traditional Lethal Weapon foundation, but I think that what keeps these movies so good is the fact that they keep coming up with cool new bad guys and interesting stories to keep the audience's attention. Part III starts off straight away with an action packed bombing scene (continuing the traditional action packed opening scene of all Lethal Weapon films so far). An important element that is found here is that almost all of the events in the Lethal Weapon films are not entirely unlikely (with the exception of things like all this shoulder popping nonsense). The bomb scenes, the threats, the gunfights, the car chases, all are manipulated for the film, but they are not as ridiculously exaggerated as things often are in Jerry Bruckheimer films. Because of this, you are able to overlook the laughable suggestion that if Riggs is driving an armored car and there is a bad guy with a gun in the passenger seat, he can send the guy through the windshield by slamming on the brakes. That was a huge flaw in part III because it ended an edge of your seat car chase with a side splitting laugh. Anyway, what I really thought was good about this installment is the story. Roger's son is hanging out with gangsters, giving the audience a feeling of unease for his well-being, and then the police discover that there are armor piercing bullets (`cop killers') out on the streets. Their objective is to find the bullets (as well as a sizeable collection of stolen guns), get rid of them, and find out who has been distributing them (and hence, find the stolen guns as well). There's tragedy, there's tons of action, there's comedy (thanks to the endlessly amusing Leo Getz), and there's even eventually a unique romance. There is something to be said about the quality of an actor that Joe Pesci is. Only he could play a pathetic role (as in Lethal Weapon 2, 3, and 4, as well as the failure of a crook in Home Alone) but also play other parts such as that of a ruthless gangster (as he does numerous times in other films). Yes, Lethal Weapon III does have the obligatory romance, and while I am generally against this in action films (take virtually every Jerry Bruckheimer film ever made), it is done very well here, because it fits the characters very cleanly. Gibson, as we know, is the registered lethal weapon on the force, and Russo is the Internal Affairs agent who is sent to investigate how 15,000 guns, which were scheduled to be destroyed, were stolen from the police and found their way into the hands of some gangsters. Gibson and Russo hate each other for much of the film, as they are almost competing against one another, but they amusingly get pretty close one night as they are having some sort of contest to see who has the biggest scars. Not real attractive, but this is what you would expect from the types of characters that they play.Despite the fact the Lethal Weapon III is a good action film and is a quality addition to the series, it is a bit of a step down from the spectacular original and the almost as good first sequel. For example, there was a small amount of things that were just thrown in. For example, there is one scene where Russo beats the hell out of several criminals at once single-handedly, but it should be kept in mind that she did that offensively. She threw the first punch and, while it was fun to watch, it's illegal to do that, and would have been much better had she been forced to defend herself. Another thing, the phrase `son of a bitch' is said in the film about 2,000 times, mostly by Roger, and it gets real tiring after a while. There's another good car chase at the end, but then we are expected to believe that these armor piercing bullets are capable of shooting through the shovel on a tractor? That scene was nicely dramatic, but I feel no reason to believe that ANY handheld gun could shoot through a piece of construction equipment like that. This movie ends with Roger being congratulated in his bathtub by his family for his retirement (much like his 50th birthday in the opening scene of the original), and it is here that he announces to them (as well as to a largely thankful audience) that he plans to postpone his retirement. Good way to end a quality action film, with the promise of a sequel. However, although Part III was a good action film, as I have mentioned before, it is a bit of a step down from the previous two, and one can only hope that this trend turns around and the inevitable third sequel comes closer to being as good as, or even better (!), than the original.

The funniest? His suggestion for Lethal Weapon 4; The barrel's empty, but they're still scraping. It's a pretty accurate assessment, and could also be applied to the third entry in the series. Its real tagline followed that of the second. Lethal Weapon 2 gave us The Magic Is Back! So what did they think of for 3? The Magic Is Back Again. The lack of thought and inspiration that went into that tagline seems symptomatic of the whole movie.1987 saw the original Lethal Weapon hit cinemas. A lightweight but enjoyable thriller with two very likeable leads and a reasonably complex plot, it had a touch of depth and made men with the names Roger and Martin sound cool. It took just two years for the inevitable and inferior sequel to emerge. While still entertaining, it saw the dilution of the original's success with elements of plot contrivance (the Houdini act; the death of Riggs' wife; the nail gun, etc) along with a passé romantic involvement and the dubious comedy character of Joe Pesci. Whereas the first film had humour that grew organically out of the situations, here it was clumsily adhered to virtually every scene, and the plot took a backseat. The movie was good fun, and slightly political, but hardly a single reel achieved anything approaching sincerity.Lethal Weapon 3 is the start of the series as a money-spinning comedy franchise with wacky support characters and so sanitised that it can earn a 15 certificate. You have to ask yourself how cool is a testosterone-led, high-octane buddy cop movie that ends with a song by Elton John?While Danny Glover still impresses with his ability to switch between comedy and drama, there are clear signs this time around that Gibson is going through the motions. Note how the two leads now seem written as caricature with Riggs' insanity there merely for comic effect, never psychological depth, and his every line a wisecrack. No longer does he threaten to commit suicide, instead he now takes to munching dog biscuits. Occasionally the one-liners are a little above average (Rene Russo You trying to bait me? Gibson I'm a master at it Russo That figures) but more often than not they're pretty lame. Like a friend of Glover's says, when's he going to say something funny? The formula of Glover being a bystander while Gibson does all the superhuman tasks (including hanging off a speeding train and falling through a house in some of the sillier sequences) is now also becoming a little tired, particularly the cliché of fist fight with the bad guy at the climax. Glover, for his part, seems to say the phrase sonuvabitch at least 5,000 times.Joe Pesci, who was much-plugged on the billboards and video covers for this one, gets no more of a role than he does in the second or fourth, though Russo's part as a martial arts expert/love interest seems excessive. Generally, it's still very entertaining, though watched in close proximity to the original it's astonishing how such a respectable series can let itself sink down into by-the-numbers plotting and self-congratulatory humour. And when a scene contrives to have Glover kneeling in front of Riggs, arms outstretched, holding some flowers and a box of chocolates, you just know that the police psychiatrist is going to walk in with a double take on her face. From the big momma cheap shot of Delores Hall to Joe Pesci yelping we're back! this is a film that is constantly aware of itself as a movie and makes no effort to disguise it. Bloated and incessantly self-amused, it goes nowhere and achieves little, save to serve as throwaway entertainment.A fourth instalment was long past it's sell-by date and saw more going-through-the-motions acting from Glover, and, again, especially Gibson. Maybe they should have given the film over to the partnership of Pesci and Chris Rock, who are the only diverting thing in the whole movie. And yes, Riggs does get to finish by having an unarmed fist-fight with the bad guy. In all, this was probably the weakest of the series, though 3 is still my least favourite. The fourth was predictable in it's lame and derivative plotting, whereas the third was the one that contained the biggest disappointment. 5/10.

This is probably the worst set of crims in any of the four films, the lead bad guy is OK but rather than wanting any of them dead they are simply more minions and faceless bad guys to be offed in between corny jokes. If I wanted to watch Americans shooting other Americans I would simply go to America!! Rene Russo is introduced as Lorna, who as well as being an Internal Affairs cop is also Mel bait, and Leo Getz is still around and has moved even further into the organised crime game - he now sells real estate.A couple of action scenes are memorable but overall this turns out to be an inferior facsimile of 1 and 2, it sacrifices action for comedy and falls flat (most notably by injecting a sassy large black woman to stalk Murtaugh).I guess that this was to be the final film in the series, as it plays out like a 2 hour mortality play. Everyone seems to be fretful that everything is coming to an end...Of course this was all solved by 'Lethal Weapon 4 The Lure of the Cash' in 1998.Being the third film in the series it would be remiss to ignore the milestones reached in this film 1 - Murtaugh reaches his second litre of on screen spit in scenes where he is hurt, punched or just yelling.Congratulations.2 - Riggs chases a motor vehicle while on foot for the third consecutive film.3 - A professional psychiatrist is lost for words in the third consecutive film after being assaulted with some pretty lame and uncreative dialogue.4 - As always the criminals don't really need to panic until Riggs' eyes open real wide and he proclaims his level of p*ssed-off-edness... now it's on!

Lethal Weapon 3 is less quotable, less funny and by substituting Rene Russo for Patsy Kensit (as lopsided a trade as the Carmelo Anthony NBA deal), far less hot.

The movie isn't horrible. It's watchable and provides the antics fans of the first two films have come to expect, but it offers no stimulation. It's flat, uninspired and typical. Riggs and Murtaugh aren't pushed in new ways or given any opportunity to grow as characters. Riggs (Gibson) is up to the same wisecrackery and Murtaugh (Glover) is still too old for this ****.The plot is pretty standard. Murtaugh is days from retirement (isn't he always days from retirement?) when Riggs sets off a bomb he was trying to diffuse when he should've waited for bomb squad. Gosh, he's so darn reckless that Riggs! You'd think writer Jeffrey Boam (Lethal Weapon 2, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) would stop leaning so hard on blanket personality descriptors of the characters. Anyway, the two get demoted to street duty where as luck would have it, they witness criminals taking something in an armored truck. They end up getting wrapped up in a major LAPD case involving an ex-cop stealing tons of automatic guns and selling them to gangs and such.The story never captures the full scope of what's going on. There's little sense of urgency and the alternative technique of mystery isn't used either. Murtaugh and Riggs just continue to be in the right place at the right time to catch bad guys in the act leading to pivotal turning points. I failed to feel any sort of emotion while watching the action in this film, I merely assumed something good would happen but not even Richard Donner could deliver on the action front.Another point to harp on is supporting cast. Boam brought back Joe Pesci's character in a small role where he's selling Murtaugh's house and also trying to get in on the action. Pesci is one of those actors that you either want to focus on or forget about because he's either very good or too much. Obviously in Lethal Weapon 3 he's the latter. Rene Russo also joins as the martial arts-savvy Internal Affairs sergeant whom Riggs gets the hots for, naturally. Just the mere technique of throwing in a love interest cop for Riggs to get serious about (which he does to not believable effect) is offensive to those who have a sense of what effort a sequel needs to make to be any good.Apathy would be the best way to describe the way one receives Lethal Weapon 3. Whereas its predecessor was infinitely more imaginative and impressive as a sequel, the horse needed to complete this trifecta was too similar and just dressed up to look different. Much of it is being stale, much of it is just not being a good script.

Many franchises suffered, but Lethal Weapon 3 fell flat for other reasons. With a reduced bodycount, Lethal Weapon 3 had to concentrate on other aspects such as the story. Unfortunately, the story here is much less interesting than the previous two, and Richard Donner's zealous moralising about a pet cause does not help matters any.The original Lethal Weapon was a simple detective story about two war veterans turned police officers who come from very different backgrounds. The action sequences worked because enough attention was paid to developing the characters that the audience cared. In spite of introducing an incredibly annoying comic sidekick in the second episode, the second film acquits itself by lending a little more depth to the established characters. The problem here is that the cast is becoming overcrowded, although the problem isn't quite as severe here as was the case in the dire fourth film.There is a saying in action films that your story and heroes are only as good as your antagonist allows. Films like the X-Men series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the previous two Lethal Weapon episodes work because they have antagonists that make it seem like the protagonist is achieving something through victory. One half expects the Martin Riggs shown in Lethal Weapon one and two to tear Jack Travis limb from limb. The fact that Travis surrounds himself with cronies whom at least half of the cast can simply kick around like dominoes does not help matters any.Thankfully, the stunt sequences in this episode have some of the previous flair to them. The armoured car chase digresses a little too much into things that are not relevant to the main action, but it has enough excitement that it can stand up to the infamous surfboard death of the previous film. Not well, but it can at least make a pretense. The chase into the subway has one powerful moment, but it ends too abruptly. Worst of all, the climactic sequence in the housing estate really feels flat. It never feels like Riggs is struggling against a worthy adversary or achieving any sense of satisfaction for the audience.Every sequel in the Lethal Weapon franchise adds a new hero, and in this case it is Rene Russo's turn. Exactly what reason they had to retain Joe Pesci other than for use as a plot device remains unclear, but at least Russo's character isn't quite so annoying. The subplot concerning Nick's friend lifts the film up a notch, but by this time, Donner's moralising has reached such a level that one cannot help being put off by it.I gave Lethal Weapon 3 a five out of ten. They really should have stopped after two as far as I am concerned, but what the hey. If you're really desperate for a few stunts, you could do worse.

Why did they think this film had to be filled with slapstick? Whereas LETHAL WEAPON 2 managed to get the perfect balance between humour, a gripping plot and fabulous action, this one seems to think the fans just want to see ludicrous set-ups. Riggs sets off a bomb at the beginning. So the couple has to fill in parking tickets in their old uniforms. Is that how L.A.P.D. handles things? Nobody is asking for reality values - but this idea isn't even remotely funny. Unfortunately the script brings Leo Getts back and doesn't know what he should do there. Joe Pesci is a great actor, but even he cannot help but being annoying this time. Whereas he was a key character in the second film (and has very nice moments in LETHAL WEAPON 4 - just watch the Froggy scene!), this time he goes not only on Riggs' and Murtaugh's nerves with his o.k.o.k.o.k routine. On top of all this the villain is so forgettable, you hardly can remember him when the end titles roll. Even the action scenes seem to be shot with some lack of conviction. Anyway, Gibson and Glover do their stuff alright. And Rene Russo is a good addition to their team. Still, even a weak LETHAL WEAPON film rates far higher than most van Damme or even Stallone shoot-'em-ups.

The death of the young officer who followed the two heroes into the police parking garage was so predictable he might as well have been wearing a red uniform.  Finally and related to the first problem is how Director Richard Donner has turned this movie, at least in part, into a soapbox for is pro-gun control views'.  I'm no fan of the NRA.

Re-watching this, I think part 4 is even slightly better than this heap of time-waste. This rivals Robocop 3 and Mad Max Thunderdome as the worst of the second sequels. I really liked the 1987 original, and the 1989 sequel was passable, but this installment pushes the goof-ball borderline-Three Stooges humor to the forefront, and offers an insipid and politically heavy-handed Donner anti-gun rant masquerading as a plot as the backdrop. I don't want to get too off topic here, but let me just say I find it beyond hypocritical and generally disgusting that a director can accept millions of dollars to make blow 'em up action films his whole life, and at the same time spew strident criticism of America's evil 'gun culture' to his audience in a vein attempt to brush up to certain elites in this country. Remembering that funny Simpson's episode where the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon added that stoopid Homer pooch to boost it's ratings; so the Lethal Weapon films add first Pesci, then Russo, then Rock/Li in a painfully obvious adherence to sequel cliché. I don't even want to talk about this film it's so uninspired. Just let me say that a bigger budget doesn't mean a more exciting movie, and that turning 3 dimensional characters into 2 dimensional cartoons does not make a movie funnier. Also, an action movie (the Director's Cut I watched) DOES NOT NEED TO BE OVER 2 HOURS when the storyline is so predictable and moves at such a formulaic pace. I recommend every action fan own the original Lethal Weapon and most fans own Lethal Weapon 2 on whatever format. But leave it at that. Pretend to yourself (like I do) that the LW franchise is a 2 film series along with Beverly Hills Cop, Robocop, and Mad Max.

It has problems though as it plays out more like an episode of a television show rather than a movie, there is not a very good bad guy in this one, and the whole Roger killing young kid scenes really bring the movie down. It also introduces yet another character in the super bad female who is just as tough as the guys and I have never liked those types. They clutter many movies these days and I don't mind them in some movies, but I just don't think she fits in this series as we already have our resident butt kicker in Riggs. The plot featuring cop killer bullets is a bit uninspired as well. Still there are the good points, very funny scenes of Roger and Riggs having to be uniformed police officers and Joe Pesci's character is great too. There is always good action in a Leathal Weapon movie as well and this one is no exception there either. Just needed more here in the form of better villains, and less here in areas of plot that just seemed unnecessary to the story or brought the movie down.

I'm not saying the movie is bad, but it is all too clear that the creators found it very hard to come up with some original ideas. In fact it looks much like the first two movies in the series, only with some different and sometimes extra characters.This time we meet police officers Riggs and Murtaugh, just eight days until Murtaugh is scheduled to retire. When a bomb is found in an apartment building, Martin Riggs goes in to dismantle it, instead of waiting for the bomb squad to do the job. Of course he cuts the wrong wire and they have to run for their lives. They make it and don't get harmed, but as a punishment for their reckless behavior, they are degraded to patrolling the streets on foot. While on patrol, they witness a hold-up on an armored truck. They are able to arrest Billy Phelps, but in the interrogation room Phelps is murdered by a vicious ex-cop, who now sells guns that are stolen from evidence storage facilities.Of course Leo Getz is back in this movie, but this time we also meet Lorna Cole, a beautiful and tough cop, played by Rene Russo. She works for internal affairs and she'll make Riggs' life very difficult in the beginning, but gradually will help them more and more with their case.If you expect to see an original approach to the familiar concept, than you'll be very disappointed, because this movie has nothing new to offer. I guess this movie is more for the die hard fans, who only want more of the same of what the first two movies had to offer. Overall the movie still offers plenty of fun and action and I'm sure it will be loved by all the fans.

The first one was a thriller, the second one an action flick with some food comedy, this one is pure slapstick with action elements!There are just so many things that utterly suck in this one. Firstly, the comedy is really over blown and boring, the scene where Roger and the woman are chasing after the bank robbers for example. What the hell? They are chasing armed robbers and Martin is on the car roof and what is the woman doing? Flirting with Roger and trying to make a comeone. Awful. This appears in the second instalment as well but much more toned down and, although not totally believable, still enjoyable. Here it just doesn't work. Joe pesci, while funny in the second and fourth, here he's just annoying.Secondly, Rene Russo's character Lorna is bad. Way to big, taking allot of time away from Roger. She is also to much of a martial arts expert. I mean come on! Girl power in movies and all and I did enjoy movies like Nikita, but this one is a stretch. She kicks 4-5 guys asses at the same time while Rog and Riggs are just watching. This scene also has one of those awful, typical, and very telling signs that the movie is not a serious movie. While she is fighting with these guys she also manages to throw one of them into the trunk of the car and lock it! WHAT? Totally non believable. I did like her in the fourth one, though. There she was toned down and just a small backup character, but did still get to do some action. That is how she should have been in this one as well.Thirdly, the badguy. Come on! The Lethal Weapon series is known for having a cool and bad-ass badboy. First one there was Mr. Joshua played by Gary Busey, a real toughguy that we know very little of which makes him alot cooler. In the second one we have some crazy southafrican nazi look-a-likes that also are very memorable and in the fourth we get Jet Li, the coolest of them all. This Jack Travis guy is a total joke as a badguy.Although I hate this one I still love the other three so do your self a favour and go and rent them, avoid this one though.
