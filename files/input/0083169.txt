Especially due to the fact that I was a company commander my senior year and had my best friends as platoon leaders and XO. I got a much different take on the movie than most of you. It is one that was much more prevalent in the military academy I to than ROTC. Rather than a view of misguided youths (I would argue the point that they were misguided) I saw the movie as fight between the old and the new. The old conservative ways versus the post Vietnam War era generation. Whether to preserve conservative tradition or to continue with social liberalism. In the movie the fight was about tearing down the academy to build condominiums. In real life where I was, it was about turning our military academy into a normal prep school. In my case the fight didn't get violent, however like the cadets in the movie I picked the losing side.In the movie I was heart broken that the governor would send troops to the school rather than try and work out a peaceful compromise when he saw the measure that people were willing to go to in order to protect their school. In real life I was very disheartened to see the old cadre of retired military officers get sacked and replaced by soft civilian administrators. It all hit a climax when one of my life's role models, a retired USAF Major and our companies tactical officer, spoke out against some of the changes being made and got himself sacked. For me that was George C Scott, Penn and Cruise were my friends and platoon leaders in my company and the crisis between the old ways and the new ways were very much the same. The movie reached out to me possibly more than any other. It was seeing my teenage self all over again.

Scott) is the commandant of the school.  His curiculum teaches his young charges teamwork, personal honor, courage and sacrifice.  But something is lost in the translation.General Bache answers to the schools board of trustees.  They have decided to close the 141 year old institution for the purpose of realizing the full potential of the real estate.  The news is devastating to Bache and his student body.  Operating on the lessons he has been taught by his mentor, General Bache, Cadet Major Brian Moreland (Timothy Hutton), Student Body Corps Commander, decides there is courage and honor in defending the institution with their very lives if necessary.  Together with Calvary Corps Commander Alex Dwyer (Sean Penn) and elite company commander David Shawn (Tom Cruise), they set about doing just that.Taps, directed with style and class by Harold Becker, is a study of misdirected honor and courage.  The students involved are not much younger than those who would be sent to distant battlefields by the active duty military.  They are impressionable and taken by uniforms and strict discipline.  They are intelligent but inexperienced.  They are the future leaders being molded by General Bache.  General Bache is a good, fatherly man who has forgotten one thing-personal honor and courage mean nothing unless these values are supported by the one ideal worth lives-freedom.  This ideal is the reason our military exists and this is the one, most important lesson General Bache fails to teach his young future leaders of the United States military.  His students overreact to a situation that does not warrant sacrificing lives for.Timothy Hutton is outstanding as the misguided Cadet Commander.  Even his father, a top sergeant in the U.S. Army, can't talk him out of the path he has chosen for himself and his fellow students.  There is also a subtle hint that his relationship with his father was never the best.  Sean Penn turns in a great performance as the Corps Cavalry Commander and Moreland's right hand man who doesn't believe things could spin out of control so badly and comes to realize there is something wrong with the path Moreland has chosen.  And Tom Cruise is powerful as the ultra-disciplined elite company commander who seems to relish a fight more than anything he's been taught about honor and courage.The principles receive wonderful support from Ronny Cox as the commanding colonel of an Army National Guard unit who desperately attempts to talk reason to Moreland.Taps is not perfect.  I couldn't understand why General Bache would take a loaded ceremonial pistol to a school military ball.  But then again, I have witnessed one or two acts in my own real life active duty service which took less common sense than that.Overall, Taps is a well directed story with strong characters and depth.  The film warns us of the dangers of honor without purpose.

Firstly, as someone else on this sight mentioned, the film is quite beautiful to look at.  The cinematography is quite stunning actually, and if you don't believe me, watch it again.  Secondly the direction, writing, and editing is tight, controlled and technically fairly solid.  But what made this film for me was the impressive, inspired acting by the, at the time, young cast.  I was captivated by the core trio of Cruise, Penn, and Hutton.  If charisma were a concrete substance these three would have garbage bags of the stuff stowed in their cupboards.

The teachings of this military institution, molding young men 12 to 18 years old, have a profound effect, especially in the intense Brian Moreland, who is a clear favorite of the academy director, General Bache.Harold Becker directed Taps, which is based on a novel by Devery Freeman. The action of the film takes place in the fictional Bunker Hill Military Academy, that has just been sold to private investors who want transform the site into condominiums.With a history of having molded young minds during its distinguished history, Gen. Bache is horrified by the mere thought of losing the academy and the young people he has helped to involve in the rich life of the military. After a tragic incident that involves the killing of a townie, Bache suffers a heart attack, leaving the academy in the hands of people that are seen trying to undermine the fallen leader.Brian Moreland, the serious minded young man, takes it into his own hands to take care of what he thinks would be Gen. Bache's reaction in saving the school by getting the rest of the students left at the academy to hold it hostage and not give in to the upcoming changes, or to other people who don't have the same purpose in mind.Timothy Hutton is about the best thing going for the film. This young actor brought the right amount of seriousness, courage and valor to the role. This film is basically the big screen debut for Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, who went to build spectacular careers of their own. George C. Scott, another excellent actor is seen as Gen. Bache, but unfortunately, he doesn't have much to do and only appears in the opening sequences. Other familiar faces in the cast, Billy Van Zandt, Giancarlo Esposito.Taps is a film that shows how some young minds will act when they follow to the letter things they have learned in theory in the classroom. It also recognizes how honor could get a well meaning person to do things that he will regret later on and how it can cause harm to innocent young men that go along with these new leaders.

It should be mandatory viewing for anyone planning a military career so that they can really evaluate their reasoning for joining the armed services. It should be especially mandatory for any ROTC cadet in college (I'm in such a program, so I speak from experience).Everyone involved played excellent roles and made the viewer make it as if they were really caught up in such a situation in real life.

The Board of Trustees is selling off the place for its prime real estate value to be used for condominium development. Certainly an occurrence we've seen all over the country in many places and not something really desirable in many.Cadet Major Timothy Hutton knows he will head the last graduating class at Bunker Hill. He and fellow cadets like Sean Penn and Tom Cruise aren't taking it lying down. They may be military cadets, but they've seen and grown up with student protests. Only these students have weapons and are trained in their use. Can you really blame the cadets like Hutton who've actually in fact forgotten that soldiers carry out and don't make policy? I think it was significant that during the course of Taps it's mentioned that George C. Scott served with General Douglas MacArthur who gave him a sword for his service. It's also mentioned that Scott was passed over for promotion an advancement beyond being a brigadier general and was retired comfortably out to pasture at the Academy.Scott's not the same kind of military man you see in Patton. Rather he's a lot like the Patton you see in that television film, Patton, the Last Days. A man so totally out of his element that when the accident and broken neck occurred he'd lost his will to live.Anyway after a scuffle with some of the town louts who are less than enamored of Bunker Hill's military tradition. A town kid is accidentally killed when he tries to get Scott's military issue pistol and it discharges. In a court of law, the man would have been acquitted, but Scott answers to a higher law he lives by. That scuffle threatens to close the school even for the last year and the kids seize it. It's a confrontation then between idealistic and wrongheaded youth and the real forces of law enforcement.Ronny Cox contributes a very nice performance as the commanding general of the National Guard trying to keep a lid on the situation. His scenes with the idealistic and obstinate Hutton are the highlight of the film for me.Tom Cruise and Sean Penn got their first real notice in this film right at the start of their respective mega-careers. Hutton has a nice followup to his Oscar winning performance from Ordinary People. And George C. Scott is, George C. Scott.

It was adapted from the novel Father Sky written in 1979.. but adapted for the early 80s, tackling the state of US Military academies and the people who are a great part of them. In this film... it's not about the major US military academies but the minor ones that are being given their own moment.In this case, Bunker Hill Military Academy. (The film through was filmed in historic Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Wayne, Pennsylvania, near the famous fields where Washington and his men took camp for the winter in 1777.) The academy, similar to the Surovov Military Schools in Russia and Belarus as a junior military college, trains middle and high school level boys academics, character and leadership skills preparing them to become part of the US Army soon as officers in the USMA in West Point, and is led by the great George Scott, a retired US Army general officer, as its Commandant. (He's to me my Gen. Patton, Ol' Blood and Guts....)That movie reminds me of the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolutionary War... (the academy got its name from this great battle)At the academy's graduation parade Scott shocked everyone with his announcement by the next year, as decided by the school board the academy will be closed and the land where it is located prime real estate. No one is more surprised of this than the next year's cadet commander, Timothy Hutton, by now a Cadet Major (Scott had promoted him the night before), leader of next year's seniors and the corps of cadets (the last in its history) and mentored by the veteran commandant. He's well loved by the cadets here and is truly their leader, especially by the cadet officers under him. Also surprised by this bad news are his two fellow cadet officers and best friends, CDT CPT Tom Cruise, a elite cadet company commander (thus the red beret on his uniform) and CDT CPT Sean Penn of the cadet cavalry troop and also the executive officer of the corps. The other cadet officers, Giancarlo Esposito and Evan Handler, cadets Daniel Kimmel, John P. Narvin Jr., Brendan Ward, and others were also dismayed but as always had hope in Hutton to do something about it at once. They share the same feeling with the Commandant... that when they're still around it will not close down and continue its mandate.At the academy prom that same night a group of town teens came to disturb the occasion outside. When two of the COs suddenly approached them then angrily followed by the other cadets, a fight broke out and suddenly Scott came out to intervene when one of the teens stole his pistol and when he had it back, it shot one of the teens by accident, killing the teen. And after being arrested, he later had a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. The result the school board decided it would push on with the closure in a month or two. That made everyone shocked and soon the school would be a virtual fortress and its cadets, led by Hutton, Cruise and Penn... soldiers on a mission to save this piece of history for good, all at the cost of their lives.While on the go for supplies the truck that CDT CPT Esposito drives with some of the cadets (Hutton was left behind and had told to the dean and others in the armory about his future plans to prevent the school's closure) is stalled and is attacked by the same teens that disturbed the prom but later comes back thanks to Cruise's efforts. Upon returning their weapons and positions are prepared and soon... it's in a state of siege. Soon the police surround the grounds, then the parents come in to ask their boys to give in, among them Wayne Tippit, the Army Master Sergeant who is also Tim's dad (In one occasion he tells Hutton that what they are doing is the wrong execution of the right idea), and soon... the Army National Guard unit led by Ronny Cox, a ANG Colonel who wants the cadets out. Soon he informs them of the commandant's demise and the cadets pay tribute to him at once but later.... things are gonna turn bad.The film follows the rest of their actions very well. It's a well depicted and beautiful film made. It's truly the best military academy film made after over 30 years. Of course who would forget this would be Tim's first after his Oscars achievement, Tom's film no. 2 and Sean's debut performance? And also the late George Scott did well here too as the academy commandant. It's very good and it motivates me a lot.Oh and the final scenes... when Cruise is found by Tim and Sean firing a machine gun at the Army National Guardsmen shouting It's beautiful, man! BEAUTIFUL! and is later shot dead with his best pal... it's tragic and shocking. One of the film's best moments. As a future US Navy NROTC student I'll gonna love it and I truly recommend watching this. 3 decades after, the memory of the cadets killed in the fight for Bunker Hill Military Academy will still be remembered, forever. They died for a good cause... and the film illustrates this in a great way.Eternal glory be to all of them who died just like every soldier, doing the ultimate sacrifice for the defense of our freedom. I always think of them everyday. Always.

Some perform predictably while others really shine (particularly Brendan Ward as Charlie Auden).The film holds up well after 30 years, feeling more like a story SET in the early 80's rather than being burdened by its age. Cinematography is dramatic, though not always dynamic, and makes GREAT use of the borrowed setting of actual Valley Forge academy.The story is paced well, though some may feel it to be kind of slow. This is NOT an action movie, and is far from a traditional military movie either. Those who are looking for something along the lines of We Were Soldiers or even the first half of Full Metal Jacket will be very disappointed. Those with a more open mind for classical story-telling will find a surprisingly detailed portrayal of life in a military academy and a deeper story than may be seen on the surface.Atypical for the theme and maybe not for everyone, but definitely worth a shot.

I'm sure in the TV advertisements the appeal was obvious. Actors near my age and my older brothers' ages,the (then) cool look of their uniforms and without a doubt,that scene in the the ad where the students are overhead with their guns pointed at the adults,I.E. rebellion. Hard to find a pre-teen or teen-age boy who wouldn't find this kind of thing appealing. In the new Reagan,conservative '80s era it was fitting. One's point of view can only describe to that person what this film is all about. Some have felt this film is pro-war,while others (like me) feel it's th opposite. I find it to be even more than that though. It seemed to me that it's just as I stated above. The naive' appeal of war and weapons to young minds,as well as the parents who send their kids to these kinds of places to shape them up. No offense to those who did attend an academy,there are those who actually do get something out of it,but for my own life experience and views,I'll more than likely never understand what that would be. Self discipline can be taught to one's self just as easily.Anyhow,getting back to the film. As a movie it was quite the intense experience. George C. Scott was great in it but I really wish his character had not been removed from the story. I felt he brought these kids a level measure of control and a wiser voice of reason. Timothy Hutton,Sean Penn and (aside from the younger kids)the 17/18 year old Tom Cruise are all fantastic in their roles. In the case of Penn & Cruise a pre-view of good things to come for them as actors.Penn is a great friend to Hutton's character and this may seem like a simple role at first but as the story goes on his performance builds on itself with his still very fresh abilities as an actor.Cruise is unsettling but electric as the cadet who likes the power & control he's been trained with just a little too much. Resulting in the climactic scene where he goes trigger-happy with a machine gun near the end of the film. It's beautiful man! is the most remembered line from the whole film.Hutton,the veteran actor of the 3,plays a young man who has a more idealistic view of his education at the academy and of the overall meaning. It's more like an elegant party for him and his hanging out with old soldiers. The taking of the academy by the students was handled convincingly enough but the idea that they'd bring in tanks and the real army seemed a bit much. The pressure of that later resulting in a bit of a dissension between Penn & Hutton.The thing that has not set to well with those that have seen this movie is the senseless killing of a boy who's only about 10 or 11 by the military. Even over 27 years later,it still feels like it was not a necessary thing to put in this movie to make the point of what happens to these boys when they end up in a real war. The point was made long before that. It was equally unnerving for me to realize that even kids that age can stop living'.That nearly fatal story choice aside,the film really is great. The best thing one can do before watching is just put aside your left or right views and just watch it as you would any other movie. What I learned years later is not to let myself get so deep into the politics and just keep in mind,that's Hollywood and the film-makers ideas and/or ideals.

It's beautiful! &#x96; Tom Cruise (Taps)Taps is a confused but entertaining military drama about a group of young military school cadets (led by a kid called Brian Moreland) who take over their military school in order to save it from closing. Father Sky, the novel upon which the film was based, was a light satire which used its central siege to examine the herd mentality of the military and to poke fun at the way anti-war protesters are often just as crazy and militant as those they rally against.This film is too timid to bash either the military or the ultra-left, however, and instead paints Brian Moreland as a young and confused Colonel Kurtz figure who hijacks a military school because he wants to preserve military traditions. As the military school is being shut down, Moreland feels as though he is being denied honour and prestige. He thus starts a little war - which all the other cadets join in on - and justifies his actions by saying that he's honourably trying to preserve the traditions of the school and prevent it from being closed, when in reality he simply wants to glorify himself with a little combat. The film thus examines the naive appeal of war, what separates glory hounds from real soldiers, and points out how ridiculously dishonourable it is to start a war solely for the purposes of finding honour. Abstract this further, and you have a comment on the Vietnam war a government starting a war to preserve the honour of democracy when in reality it seeks only to install its own power.7.9/10 &#x96; Sean Penn, Tom Cruise, George C Scott and Timothy Hutton make up for director Harold Becker's flat direction.

That isn't so in regard to TAPS, the great majority of the comments that I've read about it here - and, I admit, I haven't read them all - are totally on target, whether the poster liked or didn't like the message that TAPS had about what goes into the correct training of a military officer, and what happens if that training becomes short-sighted.TAPS is an important movie because it is an excellent study into what a soldier IS and what he ISN'T. It shows, for example, that one preserves one's honor when one goes to war, but that the preservation of honor isn't by itself enough to start such a battle. It explores the difference between a true soldier and a death lover, as Ronny Cox's character so amply puts it.These are just some of the important issues that TAPS explores about what goes into the making of a soldier and the purpose for starting a war. The movie delves into other important military issues too but the importance of this film lies in its ability to explore them all. An attentive audience member will certainly leave this movie realizing that its messages must be remembered and pondered over.

The film also meshed civilian harsh views towards the military and a freudian look at the psychological angle used to turn young men into hardend killers only to have the civilians learn they cannot be controlled. TOM CRUISE gives great range in his role as a cadet who turns psychopathic; a man who meshed a little too well with his OCS/ROTC training, into a killing machine without thought or remorse. The portrayl of cruise as this character is chilling. This is not a bad film, as it reflects the post vietnam view of civilians toward the US MILITARY. The film also focuses on the other cadets who begin to lose favor with the seige and want to end it, only to be manipulated by TOM CRUISES character and a elite group of students ear marked for special forces. The film concentrates on a command power struggle between Crusie and TIMOTHY HUTTON, who is grieving the loss of their school GENERAL played by GEORGE C. SCOTT, who is killed by angry youths; a catalyst for the takeover. As the film progresses the governor sends in RONNY COX as a national guard commander with a m-60 tank platoon to stop the problem. The film continues until the climax and we are left with a question...who watches the watchers? Ultimately who was responsible for the malfunction at this school and the LORD OF THE FLIES break up into sects within the seige group holding onto  the school? Was it the system that trains a man to become a hardend killer only to say....whoops we can't control him or diffuse him. Or is this a commentary on a peace time initiative when there is no war to fight...perhaps a commentary on U.S. military doctrine and philosophy and ultimately psychology in the post Vietnam years with no war to fight. We train our service men and cadet for battle but do we train them on discernment on how to pick those fights? This is a question left unanswered by this film, yet undoubtedly raised by it.

These military boys want to take a stand and with these things the situation get wildly out of hand, not helped by the adults who won't sit down and talk which ultimately is all they have been asked for from the get-go.What struck me from the beginning is how the people acting most like adults through the whole situation were the children, the adults who could very easily taken control of the situation, by giving credit where credit was due and showing some respect to the boys, instead opted for throwing their weight around and yes, in the end they won, but was the cost too high?This film teaches a great lesson in how we tackle potentially volatile situations in life.

It was, and still is, a powerful movie. The different characters were wonderfully written and played very well by the different actors.If you have never seen this movie I suggest doing so.I liked the whole movie. The story line was phenomenal. It's about a military school called Bunker Hill Military Academy and it's students. At the beginning of the movie it is the end of the school term and the start of summer vacation. Some of the students are staying for the summer, including Cadet Major Brian Moreland (Timothy Hutton), Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer (Sean Penn), and Cadet Captain David Shawn (Tom Cruise). The school's superintendent is General Harlan Bache (George C. Scott).Moreland is newly promoted to Cadet Major at the beginning of the movie. He is friends with Dwyer and Shawn, and he tries to emulate General Bache. At the commencement ceremony for the out going senior class General Bache reveals that the board of trustees have decided to close the school at the end of the next school year. They want to make way for a condominium complex.One very powerful scene is when the remaining cadets are having a dance. Some local teens are harassing arriving guests and the cadets. Moreland politely asked the teens to move along. One of the teens walked up to Moreland and threw a punch. As Moreland and the other cadets are defending themselves one cadet runs and gets General Bache. As soon as Bache attempts to stop the melee one of the teens jumps on his back and grabs for his sidearm. The teen gets the handgun loose from the holster and pulls the trigger. Bache didn't know that there was a live round in the chamber. The teen who first attacked Moreland was shot in the chest and died instantly. The police are called and Bache is taken into custody.The following day the board members come to the academy to do inventory of the weapons located there. Moreland realizes what is going on and before the sheriff comes to confiscate the arsenal, Moreland takes them. Moreland wants the academy to stay open. He and the remaining student body take control of the academy and refuse to surrender. At one point, Moreland's father comes to negotiate the surrender, it does not go well.Even though Moreland is friends with both Dwyer and Shawn, the animosity between Dwyer and Shawn is very evident. In one scene it is revealed to Moreland that Shawn has given orders to shoot anyone coming over, around or under the walls by the sentries. Moreland barely blinks, saying that those were the proper orders to give. The tension on Moreland gets to be too much when twice several students leave, when asked, rather than stay to defend their school. As time goes on, one student is burned in an accident after the power was turned off and another student was shot because the National Guard unit that arrived thought he was firing at them (he wasn't).After Moreland finds out that Bache passed away from a heart attack Moreland begins to question whether he and the other cadets are doing the right thing. Dwyer attempts and succeeds in talking Moreland into surrendering. Shawn has other plans. The power really goes to his head and he starts firing on the National Guard. The National Guard returns fire and eventually kills Shawn. Moreland attempts to save Shawn but is killed also. Dwyer carries his friends body from the barracks followed by Colonel Kerby (Ronnie Cox).This is a adrenaline filled movie that ends very tragically. It's about teenagers, who are sent to a military school for one reason or another, taught to be soldiers and defend their rights. But they misread what they are taught, and end up in a world of hurt. The movie ends with the cadets surrendering and Dwyer carrying Moreland out the front gate.I like movies like these. I like how it actually has a plot that goes from A to Z. The acting in this movie is pretty good. I give this 10 stars out of 10. Even though it is a dated movie, and some of the sentimentality is different between the time it was made and today, it's still pretty good.

The head of the school is played by George C. Scott as General Harlan Bache, veteran of many battles and the inspiration to many cadets.

It turns out the property is worth much more as a housing development, and the owners will give the Sacha exactly one more year, then it will be closed and all buildings torn down. General Bache won't take that without a fight, and neither will his new cadet commander Major Brian Moreland (Timothy Hutton). An incident outside the school with 'town boys' results in an accidental shooting, and the General is taken away. He is reported to have had a heart attack, and the boys are left alone. Being a well-trained cadet, Moreland decides to step up and resist. He sees that all cadets are armed, the school gates are locked, and there is a stand-off with local police and the national guard.Other cadets with key roles are Sean Penn as Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer and Tom Cruise as the over zealous Cadet Captain David Shawn. Hutton, Penn, and Cruise all were in the 17 to 20 year old range when the movie was filmed, and it was nice seeing them in good early roles.SPOILERS. Cadets die in two unfortunate incidents. In one, a bright, younger cadet finally snaps and runs for the gate, seeking protection. But he drops his gun, it fires, and the guardsman outside shoot him. Nearer the end of the movie, when Moreland finally realizes it is over, the General has died, there is no longer a cause worth standing up for, while all cadets are being called out Cadet Shawn goes 'postal' and begins shooting from a corner upstairs window. When Dwyer and Moreland get to him, to stop him, both Shawn and Moreland are killed.

The movie has so many technical inaccuracies I don't know where to begin in discussing them.While the performances are great in Taps, the basic premise of the movie is wildly unrealistic. In reality, the students would have gone for the summer and the school would have sent them letters advising that it was closing, and that would have been the end of that. But that doesn't create the right environment for the plot that underpins this movie.I can't imagine any military academy catering to boys between 12 and 18 would have stored any military hardware on its premises beyond non-functioning drill rifles and swords, and maybe one or two ancient cannons capable of firing black powder only for ceremonial purposes. If the boys had been allowed access to any weaponry and live ammunition, they would have been on a military base and closely supervised by professional soldiers.The military forces that were assembled outside the school could have forced their way in and taken over very quickly without sustaining any casualties. An M60 machine gun won't do anything to a M60A3 tank other than annoy the crewmen inside.As we see in the closing minutes of the movie, a burst from one tank's .50 calibre heavy machine gun did a fine job of punching through the walls of the room where Cadet Captain Shawn had set up a M60 machine gun. Indeed, even if all the students/would-be soldiers had set up defensive positions in their rooms, they would be just as vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and thus unable to mount an effective defence.Cutting off water and food supplies is pretty much standard procedure when dealing with holed-up people who don't want to come out, and the boys would not have lasted long without water. The few canteens we saw being filled up would not be sufficient to keep them going for more than a day, if that. By the third day, all of them would be begging for water and would have been unable to mount any kind of meaningful resistance.If the boys had remained outside in their defensive positions all that the army would have needed to do is drop in a lot of smoke, tear gas and flash-bang grenades to cause massive disruption and confusion - enough to cause the boys, in their hungry, tired, thirsty and exhausted state to surrender or try to flee. Professional soldiers have trouble functioning without proper food, water or adequate rest, so a bunch of inexperienced boys would have collapsed even sooner.Clearly, the army held off in hopes that they could de-escalate the situation and achieve a peaceful outcome. But this was not to be.Where Taps succeeds is in the high quality of the acting, characterization, and in its ability to appeal to its target market teenaged boys between 15 and 17 years old who think they are immortal and can do anything. But sadly, none of the good points can rescue a movie with such a wildly implausible and unworkable plot.

What I mean is that the disbelief of the central premise would have been slightly easier to suspend if the plot were hatched at a military college and not at a military high school. The characters could have been older and wiser. They would also have had more invested in the outcome of their adventure.

Although it has an interesting premise (Group of students take over military school after it is scheduled to close down), is spun into a way too long story. It's really hard to keep focused on this one for over 2 hours, I'm afraid to say...But if you're a fan of one of the young guns in this film, you should definitely go rent it some day or catch it on TV. 5/10.

This Means War!","Date":"10 October 2004","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!! CADET-MAJOR THAT IS!Another successful year at Bunker Hill Military Academy has come to an end. Bunker Hill is the finest full-fledged military school in the nation. Many fine men have come and many have graduated with all the principles and honor a true soldier should have. For they were under the guidance of one man, General Harlan Bache. The general had been with Bunker Hill a good many years and knew all there was to know about war strategy and honor. He would tell his cadets many stories about this. Well, many cadets were looking forward to next year, particularly Cadet Brian Moreland was most excited of all. And why shouldn't he be? For at dinner that night, General Bache promoted him to Cadet-Major. His friends Cadets Alex Dwyer, David Shawn, J.C. Pierce, Billy Harris, Edward West and others really looked up to him from then on. It looked like there was going to be another great year ahead of them, but one fateful day, General Bache informed his troops that after 141 years of faithful service, Bunker Hill Academy was going to be shut down, totally demolished and made way for housing developments. The cadets were shocked. The general did not want to give up his life's work for mere condominium. He wasn't going to allow this to happen. Cadet-Major Moreland decided whatever the general was going to do, he was in on it too. That night was the Cadet-Senior prom, which turned out to be a real tragedy. Nobody was stood up or anything, but in the parking lot a group of hoodlum drunken teens began taunting the cadets. Finally, when J.C. and Moreland lost patience and the other cadets joined them, a huge scuffle began. General Bache came out to break it up when a teen jumped the general and reached for his gun. When General Bache grabbed it back, the gun accidentally went off and killed one of the teens! After that, the general was devastated for he felt that was his fault. Not only that, but he suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital.With the school under no leadership, plans to evacuate and demolish the school had moved from a year to the next month or so. The cadets were very upset about this, but Moreland decided to take charge then and assured everyone that nobody was going to take away their school. The next day, Moreland held down the weaponry warehouse with some inter-mediate cadets while Shawn, Dwyer, J.C. and several other cadet-seniors took two army trucks out to pick up provisions and supplies. Unfortunately, en route back, the piece of junk truck J.C. drove suddenly stalled and wouldn't start up again. That truck is not just a piece of junk. It's a useless, clanking, abomination, stone-aged pile of ruckus, disgrace to the road. Dwyer couldn't fix it. Even more bad news the gang they encountered the previous night (friends of the teen General Bache accidentally shot) came over to see what was up. That stupid truck still wouldn't start, so they began beating up J.C. and Dwyer. Shawn saved them by scaring off the gang with a gun. Then they all pile into his truck and head back to school. Once back, Moreland appoints stations and passes out weapons. Before long, a fleet of police cars arrived and parked directly outside the front gate. The sheriff called to Moreland and told him to surrender, but he would not. Then the parents of the other cadets wished to speak with Moreland. Among them was Moreland's father, Sgt. Moreland, who really wasn't that nice of a guy. They could not convince Moreland to drop his guard and give up. So Sgt. Moreland cursed out his son and smacked him. Before long, the REAL army showed up and dozens of large trucks. The leader of this group was Colonel Kerby. Kerby was unable to get Moreland to change his mind. But it was then that Kerby delivered some very bad news General Bache had died. So the cadets do a 21-gun salute to honor the good general. If things looked worse now, they were about to go even further down on the Worse-O-Meter, for the army brought a large tank to counter with any force the cadets may use. Moreland did not want his soldiers to think they were there by force, so anybody who wanted to leave could. Unfortunately, about 48% of them left. Among them was Moreland's good friend, Edward West. As if that weren't bad enough, soon the school's power and water supplies were all cut off. When J.C. tried to get the generator to work, it blew up, catching him on fire. J.C. is rushed to the hospital, but by then he had died from his wounds. Tension was mounting inside the school, and morale was slipping between the cadets. Alex Dwyer practically lost it and got into a fist fight with Moreland. Later that night, as one young cadet climbed the gate to run away, his friend, Charlie, ran after him. The army outside got panicked so they fire--and killed poor Charlie. He was just a kid! Due to the recent events and the two casualties, Moreland finally decided to surrender. He called off his men and they all surrendered to Colonel Kerby. Al; except for Shawn who had an arsenal of guns in his room. He began firing at Kerby. Moreland raced to Shawn. Kerby's troops fired back. Soon Dwyer and Kerby make it upstairs to Shawn's room...But as soon as they peered inside, a terrible sight met their eyes! To find out what happened to our heroes, see the movie! I've already said too much.Well, what can I say about Taps? It was acted out very well. The story was good and strong. A group of cadets at military school wanting to fight for what they believe in, but soon, through a chain of tragic and unfortunate events, learn that society has them greatly outnumbered. Good performances, the late George C. Scott is magnificent as General Bache. Timothy Hutton was very good as Moreland. Tom Cruise and Academy Award Winner Sean Penn are here too. Cruise and Penn were only 19 years old when they did this movie. Ronny Cox, the bad guy from RoboCop, was good too. This film has a very serious mood and a downbeat ending, yet it is a very good movie. I recommend it. If you like movies about war strategy and standing up for what you believe in and are willing to fight for it and take no prisoners, then Taps is for you! See it today. That's an order, soldier!- "},{"Title":"where were the adults?","Date":"2 April 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I know there was a bus with a few bureaucrats and such on the bus being escorted out during the siege but don't you think there would have been loads of teachers and cooks and janitors etc.They Cadets would have had a hard time rounding everyone up, and cant you imagine telling your favorite teacher that your sorry but your taking over the school and then putting the muzzle of your AR-15 to his head LOL.

But the film is totally dominated by a magnificent bravura performance by Timothy Hutton, of astonishing power and conviction. The film is set in a boys' military academy called Bunker Hill Academy, in America. For people not familiar with such institutions, or indeed for all people unfamiliar with America, it is common for boys' boarding schools to be 'military academies', the very idea of such a thing being of course unknown in Britain. And by military they mean military, that is, the boys really wear uniforms all the time, drill like soldiers, and are subjected to military discipline. Many fathers think this 'makes a man of' their sons. What it can do, however, is scar them for life. (This happened in the late 19th century in Bohemia to the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, for instance.) Some boys thrive on this kind of thing, go into the Army eventually as a career, and are happy as clams. To each his own! Here we see a military academy to beat all military academies, one which is so military it surpasses the real Army itself. At the beginning of the film it is run by a headmaster who is a spell-binding patriarch who dazzles the cadets with his oratory, a retired general played by George C. Scott. Hutton plays a cadet who hero-worships him. It is the end of the school year, and Hutton has just been appointed Cadet Major (equivalent to Head Prefect) for the following year. That means he will be the commanding officer of the students, answerable only to the General. He has been told so often about the importance of loyalty and honour that when an unexpected event occurs, he duly does what he has been trained to do, he &#x85; well, that's just the problem &#x85; At Commencement Day, in the presence of all the parents, following the parade and file-past with elaborate salutes to the General (the boy officers even hold swords to their noses as they do 'eyes right', it is all far more elaborate than any drill I ever did, and I was a cadet officer in a non-military school when young and did that kind of thing, but not with real rifles and a sword up my nostrils like we see here), the General announces that the trustees of the Academy have decided to close the school and sell off the land to commercial developers. This shocks all the boys, who begin to think they should defend their 'country', i.e. their academy, like real soldiers. There is a conflict between 'town and gown' and the townies attack some of the cadets (although the word is not used in this film, such cadets are commonly known as 'bellhops' by boys in non-military boarding schools). In the melée, the General's pistol goes off accidentally and kills a boy from the town. He is then taken away by the police, leaving the closing school rudderless, as many of the teachers and more than half of the students leave for the summer. Some, however stay for 'the summer session', among them being Timothy Hutton who is now de facto in charge of the Academy, and Sean Penn and Tom Cruise leading figures amongst the other cadets. Some of the boys are only 11 or 12 years old, but most are between 16 and 18. They decide they are not going to let the developers get away with it, and so they follow all their military training and set up a defence of the school. Because the General had been more than a little gun-happy, he had stocked the school with huge quantities of guns and real ammunition. These are duly distributed amongst the cadets and they set up defensive positions, sandbags, barriers, and sentries patrolling the walls which surround the school. This erupts into violence and gunfire and becomes 'the real thing'. The cadets keep saying that honour dictates that they must defend their principles. They do a raid on the town in a truck which they stock with food, and they hunker down to await the life and death shootout. They are all prepared to die for their school. Of course, one can sympathise with their hatred of the commercial developers who want to destroy their school and all that they believe in just for the sake of money. Hating them is one thing, but shooting them is another. With no one in charge but the idealistic Hutton, the borderline between fantasy and reality collapses. The real Army comes and lays siege to the school, bringing in tanks. When a 12 year-old cadet is shot and killed by one of the real soldiers, half the cadets desert because they are terrified, but the rest remain, prepared to die for their beliefs. This film is a study of honour, but it shows that even honour, when carried to extremes which have lost touch with reality, can become dishonour without the people who believe in it even realizing it. The film is thus an extraordinarily thoughtful study of a noble principle carried to such extremes that young kids end up dying for their beliefs, because the grown-ups will not listen to them. The ending cannot be revealed, but to say that things become hyper-tense is an understatement. This is a knockout of a film, and it would make anyone, even the dullest person, think. And as we all know, thinking is the thing that most people try to avoid doing if at all possible. So if a film can make people think, then it does deserve all the support and admiration we can give it. This film is a masterpiece of serious examination of matters of conscience, and is extremely exciting and well made.

The cadet corps is run by proud Timothy Hutton. His immediate subordinates include the sensible Sean Penn -- yes, sensible -- and the semi-psychotic Tom Cruise. In overall command is the avuncular General George C. Scott.The problem is that, as Scott announces to the cadets, the school will be closed and sold for its real estate value next Fall. They are going to mow the place down and build condominiums. Scott dies promptly of a heart attack and, led by Cadet Major Hutton, most of the kids confiscate the stores of weapons and lay down a list of demands before they will allow the school to be dissolved. I was all on the side of the cadets. Not that I love military academies but that I hate condominiums. It's rather like why I'm a vegetarian. I hate the taste and texture of vegetables but I love to kill them by eating them raw or boiling them.This film sounds like it has a lot of social relevance -- the military and patriots and men of honor on one side, and the peace-mongering wussies who never had a fist fight on the other. Now we're all going to refight the Vietnam War.But it's not like that at all. Timothy Hutton is a bright kid with leadership qualities only, as it's explained somewhat clumsily, he has reason to hate his father, who is a Sergeant Major, and has found a substitute in General George C. Scott. And therein lies the problem. Hutton has absorbed only part of Scott's message about self discipline, and death before dishonor, and all that elementary stuff. After all, he's only seventeen. It's only with a little seasoning that we can begin to look behind the buzz words.Hutton is supported by Penn because Penn has never walked out on a friend, and it's Penn who finally talks Hutton into ordering the adoption of another common tactic -- declare victory and depart the field. But Tom Cruise is the genuine nut job aboard for this adventure into terra incognito. Throughout, he's always been something of a martinet. He is the leader of a group of red berets. I don't know exactly what they're function is but it appears to be something like the Gestapo's. And while the rest of the cadet corps is marching sullenly and weaponless towards the gate where the National Guard is waiting, Cruise cuts loose from an upper window with an M-60 screaming, It's beautiful! It's BEAUTIFUL! The performances are all pretty good without any being exceptional. The chief weakness is in the script. It's opened up a whole can of worms and doesn't want to get its fingers dirty by digging into it. The problem with pride, honor, and a feeling of knowing more than others, is that that whole assemblage of attitudes can't exist without an enemy. If you're superior, then you must by definition be superior to someone else. In this case, there are only off-hand references to the pencil-pushers and bean counters. Not that the film presents external forces -- the local cops and the National Guard -- as anything other than reasonable or even perfect. But solidarity is self reinforcing. It feels so good to be part of a group that's even only temporarily powerful that often the original goal is lost sight of. That's what happened during the prison riots at Attica. The governor granted some of the inmates demands and the inmates ripped up the concession to great cheers from the throng. Finally the governor granted ALL their wishes -- and an inmate in the center of the yard ripped them up to great cheers from the throng. The point was no longer to have their wishes granted but to relish the momentary sense of power.And the distinction between civilian power over the military is hardly mentioned. It's one of the lessons that Scott apparently never passed on, but it's a fundamental one. It's why our Commander-in-Chief is called a president and not a generalissimo. Here's something the governor and the National Guard might have tried. They might have simply waited the kids out. What the heck. They couldn't have had that much food. The electricity and water could have been shut down. Enthusiasm for the cause was hardly universal -- about half of them quit. Morale would have crumbled eventually. Fads fade quickly among teens.And Tom Cruise's final insane outburst was completely unjustified by what we'd learned of his character earlier, but then it had to happen or we'd all have been denied the pleasure of the final shoot out. We're built for speed and action, not waiting patiently, not thinking things through logically. In a sense, Tom Cruise stands in for part of all of us. And so do the proud Timothy Hutton and the sensible Sean Penn. I hope when we face our next crisis, whether national or personal, we can find some middle ground.
