And, to some extent, that's what I got.  But there was a lot more, and I was deeply impressed with the realism, with one exception.  The exception comes near the end and I won't give it away, but it involves police officers taking shots at a suspect with a bus full of people in the background.One of the recurring themes of this film is how innocence and good intentions can turn into a nightmarish reality.A bank teller is confronted by a robber that she knows from childhood.  She can hardly believe what is happening, and she doesn't react in the manner in which all bank tellers are trained.  A hostage dies, and she loses her job. A slow reaction leads to a death, accusations, and the loss employment.A bright young man gets a haircut that is identical to a robbery suspect's. The police surround him.  He has a champagne bottle in his coat that he doesn't want to break and tries to pull it out.  They think it is a gun. An innocent mistake leads to a death.A loving mother can no longer afford a babysitter.  She has to bring her child to work, and he gets into some cleaning supplies.  A mother's good intention turns into a hospital trip and a custody battle.There were other instances where one mistake led to dire consequences, but I found them all believable, and none of them gave me the impression of being mere vehicles to advance the plot.I enjoyed some of the other representations of Life as it is.  One being the inclusion of a lesbian (Latifa) in the cast without making a big deal out of it.  Although exhibiting some stereotypical lesbian traits (denim overalls for example,) she wasn't overly butch.  And homosexuality wasn't used as a plot device to include nudity either.  Speaking of which, the sex in the movie was pretty well done.  When there was love, the sex was passionate. When Stony was doing it for money, she looked ready to burst into tears. For the most part, the sex came without nudity disappointing in some ways, but adding credibility to the movie in others.I did have a few problems with this movie.  One is a failing that I see in many movies.  When a character's friend or family member is killed, he or she expresses initial shock and pain, but later on exhibits no outward mental stress.  There is also the I would have done it differently factor. I felt this a few times, the first being the opening scene where Frankie (Fox) is being held up.  Or when Cleo (Latifa) is stealing get away cars and tossing the previous owner's CDs out the window.  Both of these are cases in which one needs to move fast and do what is needed to move on.  You don't have time to stare blankly at your old friend.  You don't have time to select the proper driving ambience.  But these flaws didn't take too much from the general feeling.I rated it 8 of 10.

Fox, and Kimberly Elise) who decide to go out and rob a few banks.  They don't rob banks for sheer enjoyment or because they have nothing better to do.  No, they rob them because they are getting back at the system that they feel has screwed them over in their lives.  Here are the reasons in the opening bank robbery sequence, Frankie(Fox), who was at the time a teller, was fired simply because she knew the suspect who robbed it; Stony's(Smith) younger brother, Stevie was killed by police after being mistaken for the robbery suspect;  Cleo(Latifah) joins them simply because she is p***ed off at society; Tisean(Elise) is a single mother who is barely able to support her son and when he is accidently poisoned and taken away by child services, decides she has no other choice.  I feel I must point out that up until that point, she is reluctant to join the other three women.This is a really good movie that is definitely Oscar-worthy material. Maybe not for the Best Picture category, but definitely Oscar-worthy.  The performances are excellent especially from all four of our young stars. Queen Latifah should definitely should have gotten an Oscar or Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Her portrayal of a fiery lesbian is right on key.  F. Gary Gray, who also directed Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in Friday, is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors.  I don't think you should really call Set It Off an action movie since there isn't really action until the ending.A line from the movie, if that crackhead Darnell can rob a bank, then so can we.  This quote outlines the main message that the movie is trying to tell the social standing of women in our society, saying that they have rights too.  The movie says that women can basically do anything men can do (and probably better) and they must be applauded for their efforts.  Now I'm not saying that women should all go out and round up their friends and start robbing banks.  Director F. Gary Gray definitely should be praised for his smart casting choices.10/10P.S. Now from the sound of this review, I've probably got you thinking I'm a woman.  Wrong!  I'm just a 16 year-old boy from Virginia.

Although the characters are well played with some of great and intense action scenes makes for an uneven mix of social drama and exploitation film,from which the likes haven't see since the days of the 1970's action blaxploitation films. Bank teller Frankie Scott(Vivica A. Fox)is fired from her job and joins three friends in working for a late-night cleaning service. Complaining about the work,she suggests in jest that they rob a bank. Cleo(Queen Latifah),a hard-drinking tough-as-nails female,and the only one in the group with a criminal record,is seriously interested. Both Stony(Jada Pinkett-Smith),a young woman trying to put here brother through college,and Tisean(Kimberly Elise),a single mother,dismiss the motion out of hand.Events take a turn for the worst when Stony's brother,Stevie(Chaz Lamar Shepard),is killed by the police in a case of mistaken identity,and Tisean's son is taken away from her by Child Protective Services after he accidentally swallows cleaning fluid at the girls' workplace. Frankie insists that,with her knowledge of banks,they can plan a foolproof job,and she and Cleo convince the other two that they can get out of South Central Los Angeles for good with enough cash. Stony,is sent to case Downtown Federal,where she catches the eye of Keith,a handsome,well-educated bank manager(Blair Underwood),who gives her his phone number. They soon began dating. The four girls execute their first bank job wearing wigs and sunglasses and make off with $12,000. A second robbery nets them $300,000,enough for them to leave L.A. They hide the loot inside an air vent in the cleaning office. They decide to wait three days before leaving town,until after Tisean's court date to get her child back. Meanwhile, Detective Strode(John C. McGinley)and his female partner Detective Waller(Ella Joyce) doggedly pursue all leads and identify Stony,Frankie and Cleo as suspects. Learning that their boss,Luther(Thom Byrd),has fled with the stolen money,the girls enlist the aid of an notorious gunrunner,Black Sam(Andre Dr. Dre Young),who is also a local gang leader,to track Luther to a seedy motel. When Luther pulls a gun out on Cleo,Tisean shoots and kills him. But they are unable to find the money.The girls pull one last bank job-at Downtown Federal,where Keith works. In order to get Keith out of the bank during the robbery,Stony calls him and tells him to meet her. Strode and his partner interrupt the robbery and get the drop on all four girls. In the ensuing confrontation,a bank guard fires and wounds Tisean and is then shot by Stony. The girls flee with the money and manage to elude the police for several hours. Before the night is over,Tisean dies from her wounds,and Cleo and Frankie are both killed by police bullets in separate incidents. Stony manages to get on a bus to Mexico and freedom. She calls Keith and thanks him.The motion picture,Set It Off offers the audience four intriguing young black female characters,a rare grouping in any Hollywood movie and from the strength of this film went on to become one of the top ten best action films of 1996. Three of the group who stars in Set It Off,constitute the hottest young black female actresses of their day. You have Jada Pinkett-Smith(The Nutty Professor,Menace II Society, Jason's Lyric,Collateral),Vivica A. Fox(Independence Day,Soul Food),rapper-sitcom-singer star Queen Latifah(from the television series Living Single,Chicago),not to mention at the time newcomer Kimberly Elise(John Q,Diary of a Angry Black Woman). What made this film so very riveting to watch was the electrifying performance of actress Queen Latifah,in one of the most surprising roles ever accompanish by a actress,is a thrill to watch as Cleo. No one else but Latifah can bring this riveting and pulsating character to life with her outlandish style of gun-toting and sometimes extremely foul mouthed criminal flair. Instead,Set It Off is fast paced and very well-acted.The director F. Gary Gray,most notably for the original comedy Friday,with Ice Cube and Chris Tucker,and the fast paced crime thriller The Negotiator,with Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson makes imaginative use of L.A. landscape,but still will leave a feeling of social conscience,especially when it touches the issue concerning the explosive rage inside the angry black woman,and the harsh realities of trying to survive in a rugged landscape.

The screenplay was definitely written by amateurs, packing as much melodrama into the storyline as possible.  First we introduce the character of Jada Pinkett's brother.  She's like a mother figure to him, since their parents are dead.  He's a nice guy, gets into a fight with his sister and flees the house.  It's no surprise when he turns out dead two scenes later.  Then Kimberly Elise's child accidentally swallows some household substances and the custody of the kid is handed over to child services.  We have Vivica A. Fox who got fired from her job at the bank and Queen Latifah who's just plain crazy.  Basically, the character motivations seem ripped from a soap opera.  The film is predictable from the get-go, so just strap in for the ride.  Don't expect high-class writing and high-class direction, especially from the guy who made Friday.  Don't get me wrong, that was a good movie, but like Set it Off it's only valuable as lightweight entertainment. One thing I have to say is this is one black movie that didn't go for the humdrum white people bad, black people good premise.  I assumed that was the direction the film was going after watching the first scene in which the white bank manager fires Vivica for not following procedure, totally ignoring the fact that she was at gunpoint, along with everyone else in the bank.  But then we get introduced to the other two managers, who are both black and both sleazy.  Not to say that black people are sleazy; it's just good knowing that the writers weren't associating the term white with sleazy and didn't see the characters in terms of color.  Even the John C. McGinley character, the detective who is out to get the four women, isn't entirely sadistic.  **************SPOILERS AHEAD************There are a few moments that are just too silly for their own good.  Are you telling me two cops are gonna be so distracted by an obnoxious vagrant that they'll totally disregard a bank robbery (literally) taking place right behind them?  As I said, you can tell this was written by amateurs.  And then we have Queen Latifah driving through the bank in a minivan, which is stupid in the first place and shown simply for cinematic pretentiousness, and the four women drive out, still not being actively pursued by the cops.  Latifah makes one turn and suddenly she loses the cops altogether?  That's too much disbelief to suspend.  And of course, in the usual cinematic tradition, the minor characters have to die first.  Kimberly Elise dies in standard operatic fashion--in someone's arms, saying her last words.  Only in the movies can someone die like that 90 % of the time.The acting is pretty good, though sometimes hammy.  When Jada sees her brother dead on the street, screaming and crying out, Whyyyyy!!!! (I could be paraphrasing), that was too much.  Latifah's role as a crazy thug wasn't much of a stretch, especially since this film was made back in her hip-hop days.  She is a fine actress, though, and I prefer her more mature roles in films like Living Out Loud.  John C. McGinley and Blair Underwood add a touch of class.  If F. Gary Gray weren't so dependent on melodrama and big action spectacles to create tension, this wouldn't been a much more compelling film.  Maybe someone like John Singleton or the Hughes Brothers could've made this a more powerful film.  Just don't set your expectations too high and you should have a good time.

And so begins a tale of silliness. Things happen in this film that just can't be believed no matter how much one tries to check the brain at the door. Four women are doing janitorial work. One brings her kid to the job. All four turn their backs together and as quick as you can say, contrived, the kid is under a sink drinking ammonia. The main detective character knows exactly who is behind it and wants permission to follow up on the suspects but the boss says no because the police have accidentally killed the one suspect's brother. We wouldn't want to upset them despite the overwhelming evidence against them. And then they are never watched as they enter bank after bank to rob them. In one ridiculous scene, they stand in the hallway adjusting their wigs and dark glasses disguises arguing whether or not to rob the place. No one is suspicious of these characters outside the bank entrance?? And one very glaring goof-up is when they have breakfast and then head right off to the robbery(Vivica Fox is sporting a designer baseball cap turned backwards so you know she means business) . As soon as they finish the robbery,it's suddenly night time. The flick is chock full of cliché lines and actions. The tough Queen Latifah has just driven through a line of heavily armed police who open fire on her car, turning it into swiss cheese, yet she manages to take a very long pause and then emerge with a machine gun blazing. You'll slap a knee at that scene. EVERYONE in this movie is trigger happy. All the cops and security guards shoot to kill at the blink of an eye. The main detective spends several scenes just trying to get people to hold their fire. I gave it three stars because it's so darned goofy that you will probably be entertained at the implausibility of it all.

I have in no way experienced the plight of the marginalized. I've never known what it's like to be kept below the line that divides those who should be educated and those who should be left in the dark. For that reason I, by no means, have any right to speak for those people. But after watching the 1996 movie Set it Off, I can't understand why no one seemed to get offended at its ignorance about, and exploitation of, the lower class- in particular the struggling black communities of urban areas.Set it Off is about four close-knit women who have all had tough breaks in life. They made the best out of growing up in the projects and became, for the most part, honest, hard-working and self-respecting young women. The story starts off with Francesca, a bank clerk, getting held up and witnessing a violent shoot out that her fear crippled her from possibly preventing. A by the numbers detective named Strode blames her for it, causing her to get fired. The story shifts to its main character Lida, Francesca's friend who is a janitor in an upper-class apartment building, soon learning she has to compromise all of her good traits just to break even in life. To help her little brother get some money for college, she gives in to her shady employer's sexual demands. When her brother is coincidentally mistaken for the bank robber by Strode, he is shot and killed with no apologies.The movie was off to a good start, but I quickly started noticing that its scenes were getting progressively dumber. First off all, Strode seems to be on every case that the L.A.P.D. has to offer. Being that I have heard much praise for this film, I was surprised when more and more coincidences started trying my patience. The movie started feeling like a predictable crowd-pleaser, although it was supposed to be a hard-hitting protest about why the lower class seems to have abandoned.Any high school or college writing class teaches that to evaluate something is to see how closely or effectively it comes to its intended mark. My problem with Set it Off is that it is unclear as to what its mark really is. It shakily walks the line between action movie and socially-conscious drama so much that I started to question how dumb does the screenwriter thought his audience was. Since there is an objective made early on in the script, that there must be a reckoning for the unfair treatment of these women (and the lower-class community at large), it is questionable when it starts to stray.In his three and a half star (out of four) review of the film, Roger Ebert calls it observant and well-informed. Sure the film had some very relatable characters and situations, but the screenplay is far from Observant and well-informed. If anything, the writing is histrionic. A realistic screenplay would have characters who were less heroic and aware of their exploitation. Sure Queen Latifah is fabulous as a gun-toting lesbian, but does such a character really represent underprivileged women? A competent screenplay also wouldn't rely on coincidences and action sequences to make its point.(1 and 1/2 out of 4) "},{"Title":"truthful and honest","Date":"30 May 2004","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  i thought Set it Off showed how versatile Queen Latifah is when it comes to acting.

Frankie has a good job at the bank but, when someone she knows robs the place she gets fired for being potentially involved.  She gets a job with the others as a cleaning service but soon all their situations worsen leading them to plan a bank robbery themselves.  The job goes great but soon they need another job and another - but the police are slowly closing in on them.I'm missed seeing this several times and looked forward to it a bit.  The plot is basically the same as several other crime flicks you'll have seen - gang begins robbery spree, how will it turn out? etc.  However the twist here is that the gang are all women and all black.  As a twist this is quite good as there are very few all black, all female thrillers out there, so they deserve at least one!  The plot is pretty solid and allows for good robbery pieces as well as the usual standoffs and quite exciting climax.It does also have many weaknesses.  There are too many ghetto movie clichés thrown into the mix for my liking.  Whether it be the boy bound for college who gets shot, the single mother trying to make it, the low riders etc.  I understand why they're all there but really it hurts the film a bit. One little weakness that bothered me was Stony's romance with Keith - he seemed too good to be true and doesn't fit in with all the grit etc that's going on around the rest of the film.  But that's it - aside from some sex scenes to help get men into the cinema and some lesbian stuff that appears to be the only reason to have made Cleo gay.Pinkett (as she was then) is pretty good -in fact pretty and good!  She's the only one whose character stays someone resembling reality.  I like Fox in several things but she starts normal and quickly turns into a gun-toting criminal.  Elsie is OK in her first role and is suitably soft and trapped, but Latifah overplays her butch lesbian.  Underwood is as greasy as his hair and I didn't like him and McGinley does good despite his role basically being an attempt to make the white audience feel good about their role. Outside of that Dr Dre makes a laid back cameo.Overall it doesn't rise above the level of the heist thriller generally but it's still enjoyable and is at least a different direction for all black female films - at least it's not yet another `waiting to exhale'!

And bemused they are although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A.

And in every case, the tragedy inflicted upon them would more likely have inspired a lawsuit than a desire to rob banks...so much so that each of the characters--particularly Stony--would likely have been approached by lawyers offering to sue the parties that wronged them.  From the time that Stony's tragedy occurs, in fact, the whole movie should have shifted direction--away from the bank robbery idea and toward an inquiry into that tragedy.I'm still a bit stunned by the pointless Godfather take-off scene  there was no reason for the scene to be in the movie except to showcase the actors ability to do accents--the scene didn't fit the characters at all, and took far too long to achieve its desired effect.And poor, poor John C.

The timing of scene after scene is off. The plot is off. The editing is off. The acting is off. It's like it's trying to be on target and smoothly done, and it almost seems that way at times, but then it's undermined by being too self-conscious, too manipulative and having too many plot holes. And by being out of kilter. At times, there's too much over-acting and not enough acting through the face, eyes and understatement so as to bring out the subsurface emotions. The cast has good to very good players in it, but I think the direction is the problem throughout concurrent with the editing. There are other times when the acting plays just right, right on the nose. The film is uneven on this score.The setup has 4 women who are so bullied by the system that they take it in their heads to rob banks. This motivations-heavy setup is done in such a way that it manipulates the audience, and yet it is still not believable. Why rob banks in broad daylight under the watchful eyes of cameras? Only one or a few outcomes are possible in such a story, but we are missing the sense of tragedy and foreboding that usually occurs in such a scenario. The final sequences seem altogether too sentimental and at the same time like some kind of propaganda about what ghetto life brings out in the suppressed. Granted, innocent people are being killed and hassled by police. This is shown at the outset and is one of the better and more realistic scenes. Granted, single moms have a hard time of it. But still the transition to bank robbery just doesn't take as depicted in this story.The picture is not terrible. It is likable in many spots, but it makes for uncomfortable watching too. It actually is demeaning to those who suffer under these circumstances and make do to survive without robbing banks.The story itself has far too many plot holes. They revolve around the ineffectiveness of the police, which we are supposed to believe hinges on the fact that the innocent brother of one of the women was killed by police.Compared to many Hollywood action movies, this one is actually in the ballpark and not that bubble-headed.

Gary Gary treats the the plight of a quartet of blue-collar African-American women with great sympathy in Set It Off. Each of these women have experienced adversity first hand and the idea is that they have been dealt a bad hand by destiny. One woman prostitutes herself to ensure that her brother gets to go to college, but she finds out later that her efforts were for naught. Another woman is implicated in a bank robbery simply because she knew the man who robbed her bank and didn't follow the procedures that she had been drilled in. Another woman is a single parent who has to work one job to pay the babysitter. Finally, the fourth member who is the least sympathetic is a lesbian who has been restoring her car since the seventh grade. These closely-knit friends take their lumps but decide that whatever a man can do, they can do better. Consequently, they embark on a life of crime in this predictable, often contrived, but nevertheless entertaining crime thriller. Clearly, the moral of the story is don't rob banks. If you know somebody robbing a bank, you must behave as if you don't know them. Never, never, never--if you are a single-parent--ever bring your unattended infant to the workplace. Crime doesn't pay and Set It Off makes it abundantly clearly as three out of the four survive. The fourth escapes because somebody on the other side allows them to getaway. The performances are sometimes a little too over the top, especially Jada Pinkett and Vivica A. Fox. If you abhor profanity, prepare yourself for an onslaught of the F-bomb.

It is the perfect movie to see when you just need a good movie to watch or want something different to watch. The writers did such a good job of weaving in the background of the characters and letting the movie play out, I am astounded with the quality and am quite sure that you will be too! Set It Off is such a change from the sequels and remakes that Hollywood is turning out these days. It was refreshing how the writers wound the story to make it feel alive and as if you really knew the characters. It kept me captivated, amazed, astounded, and a little bit sad when it ended. I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!

It is dramatic,fast paced and in a league of it's own.Though a brotha, I found myself identifying with each of the characters and their situations, Stony trying to find an avenue out of here, Frankie damned mad for losing out wrongly. Cleo, who's all for her crew. Tisean, who's timid but will not be put out especially by Frankie's attitude when she loses her nerve.The four friends test their relationships and find bonds stronger than even themselves. The scene where Stony slaps Cleo and Cleo yells back I've known you since 6th grade tells a story of it's own.All four actresses are electric, Jada is her element here. Vivica is sassy and she leads with daring(I felt she should've taken the cop (John C.McGinley)with her or blown him away and felt good dying afterwards knowing she got one at least), Latifah who is an accomplished singer/producer gives a stellar performance, her Cleo is just brutally convincing. Kimberley is naturally sweet and gives the friendship that element of keeping it together as they rally around her cos of the baby.The soundtrack by Brandy, Gladys,Tamia etc. is hauntingly poignant, it stirs you deeply and each time I watch this movie, I find myself unable to shed the feeling, to leave it behind.There are many things you want to do after watching the movie, you want to get on the bus like Stony and go never knowing where it will lead but daring to leave the trap behind you. You want to be there for your friends and let em know!!!I rooted for these Sistaz, I rooted for the soundtracks and I ROOT for the movie anyday!!!!!You Will Too When You've Seen It..

It is the story of four black women who are unable to cope with the demands of the world they live in. Feeling disenfranchised and frustrated, they rob a bank leading to a series of events that take them down a doomed road. But the women maintain their friendship and loyalty while clashing. The film is refreshingly devoid of easy stereotypes. Queen Latifah is an out and easily accepted lesbian. Neither the police nor robbers are portrayed as one dimensional characters. The actors are always at least equal to their roles and they sometimes surpass them. It is the best performance I've ever seen from Jada Pinkett and a great introduction to Kimberly Elise. John C McGinley is excellent as a guilt ridden police detective. A few fun plot twists are thrown in, though it does loose credibility towards the end it satisfies most dramatic requirements. There are also echoes of `Thelma and Louise' and `Bonnie and Clyde' but `Set It Off' sings to its own voice.

At the time I admit I was a little sexist and didn't take women seriously who were A. action heros B.rappers C. police officers. So the first time I saw previews of this movie you know what I was thinking. Everybody around me was raving about what a good movie it was but of course I had my doubts. I loved the actresses but the thought of an all-female bank robbing gang didn't set well with me on the REALITY level, but it came out on tape and when I was at the video store I saw it and was gonna rent it just to see if it was really as good as everybody kept saying it was. I couldn't find anything else better so I got it. When I finally watched it I found myself so hypnotized to the tv I could not take my eyes off just to even go to the restroom or get something to eat or drink it was so deep and interesting. Everybody in the movie did such a good job acting and I found myself caring for the women and hoping that they could get away with it. I was so disturbed at the end when they die, but hey how many cops, and robber movies out there where the thieves get away with it. This is now one of my all-time favorite movies and have seen it a thousand times afterwards. This movie sure opened doors for me to try new things and not judge books by the cover. In other words to all you sexist men out there just because it a female does not mean she can't play ruff house with the boys. I definetely recommend this movie if you are an action fan. ***1/2 "}{"Title":"Get ready for the ride of your life because this film will take you on it!","Date":"5 April 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Well where do I start? This is my favourite movie of all time. I wasn't really expecting much - I had never seen any of the actresses in any films before (except maybe Vivicia in Independance Day) and I had just seen a trailer for it and thought it looked ok so I rented it out. I am so glad I did! It starts off shocking and just gets better and better as it goes on. I know alot of people who hate this film - I tell everyone to watch it as I think its great and nobody seems to be too impressed except for me. Sure it has some violence and stuff, but at the end of the day I think this film is about friendship - and what you will do for your friends. It is heart-breaking and I don't think I have ever cried so much at a film as I did at this. I must have watched this film over 50 times and I never get bored with it. Vivica A Fox is excellent as Frankie, Kimberly Elise does great in her first movie as Tisean, Queen Latifah is wicked as Cleo, but it is Jada Pinkett who steals the show as 'clued - up but let down by life' Stoney. Blair Underwood is great too and gives all us girls someone to oggle!! The soundtrack is another great thing about this film. For anybody who hasn't seen this film - GO RENT IT RIGHT AWAY!! You won't be disappointed, if you are open - minded and not quick to judge then this is the film for you. But make sure you have some tissues handy!  Since seeing this film I have seen the actresses in many other things and they are all just as great in them too. I hope they all have long and great careers - especially Jada.

The characters make extremely vapid, insipid decisions during many of the plot's key twists. It still qualifies, I suppose, as far above a waste of time. Actually, my favorite part of the entire film was the opening bank robbery scene. Vivica Fox's dead on portrayal and the sheer terror of it make it vividly memorable. The film then takes us on an interesting journey (albeit the film is on a downward spiral from the start). The key story elements are unique, thought-provoking ones, the script is neither. I had a hard time caring one iota for either Jada Pinkett or Queen Latifah. Both respectable actresses in their own right, but conveying nothing substantial here. Therefore, the core of the film lies in the very ample hands of the aforementioned Vivica Fox and newcomer Kimberly Elise (dauntingly superb in this year's Beloved) and they do excellent jobs of  carrying the film forward. The beautifully constructed bank robbery scenes also help quite a bit. By the time it's all through, you realize you knew exactly where it was going. A nice finale (and I don't mean the final scenes involving Jada Pinkett escaping to Mexico, which were extremely useless and indulgent), though, helps to cover up the fact that the screenplay (complete with cliches about cops, the ghetto, etc.) was simply and mechanically going through the motions.

I can't believe this movie isn't at least rated as an 8. The best thing about it to me was the friendship. It seems as if the girls go through so much in this movie, but I find that it is extremely realistic and shows how circumstances can lead someone to become very desperate. Everyone has been sleeping on Kimberly Elise, but like Denzel Washington said, She's the best out there. People will soon see. I am so happy that this movie was made and it will go down as a classic.

This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. In short, it's no different from 90% of Hollywood product. But it's the racial angle that makes 'Set It Off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. Posing as a celebration of 'sistahood', the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating Afican-American 'gangsta' stereotype. The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, 'Set It Off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to Rodney King), and aspirational 'good' sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. 'Set It Off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of 'Shaft' and 'Superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. 'Set It Off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African-American film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.

Living in the Los Angeles ghetto, each of them struggles with economic and emotional hardships. All of them suffer deeply, due to injustices perpetrated against them by their employers, trigger-happy cops, and the welfare bureaucracy. Fed-up with how life has knocked them around, and desperate to escape the ghetto, the four friends decide to resort to robbing banks together.This film is very fast-paced, with gripping suspense throughout the course of the movie. There's scarcely a dull moment. This movie is overflowing with tire-screeching car chases, blazing gunfire, and volatile interactions between the characters. The breath-taking action sequences really draw you in to the precarious world, of the criminal quartet. It's good that Hollywood finally decided to make a film, that has African-American female characters who make such a deep impact. They're just as rough, vulgar, and determined to change their lives for the better, as any of the male characters are. They're deadly serious about being willing to risk their lives, to take up criminal activities. The women in the film, don't depend on men to determine their course of action. They know that it's up to them alone, to work together to accomplish their bank heists.The four actresses who played the main characters, all give strong performances. Especially Queen Latifah as the hardened butch lesbian, Cleo Simms. She really makes the viewer believe that Cleo can fearlessly handle just about anything, that she's up against. Jada Pinkett also gives a compelling performance as Stoney. Pinkett shows an amazing emotional range, and is able to convey the contradictory moods of Stoney with ease. Vivica Fox as Frankie, is vivid in her role, but not quite as charismatic as either Queen Latifah, or Jada Pinkett. Kimberley Elise as the desperate single mother, Tisean, gives a heartrending performance.This film crackles with a heady intensity, that's rare in films with women as the main characters. These sistahs prove that they are forces to be reckoned with, as they fight for their dreams in a male dominated world. This cutting-edge action film, delivers jolt-after-jolt of exciting entertainment.

A movie that makes you care about the characters and what happens to them. It's especially rare in this genre. But what makes Set it Off, F. Gary Gray's second feature, stand out is that it does what few films take the time to do it develops its characters and makes the audience care about them.Stoney (Jada Pinkett Smith), Cleo (Queen Latifah), Frankie (Vivica A. Fox) and Tisean (Kimberly Elise) have been close friends for years. At the movie's beginning, we find that each one of them has been wronged by society because of money. Desperate to get out of their minimum-wage lives, the four turn to bank robbery to help them get out.Set it Off would be another dull, violent action movie had it not been for four superlative performances. Jada Pinkett Smith is one of the strongest actresses out there, and here she gets to flex the acting muscles that she showed in Menace II Society. It's a terrific performance. She is the most developed (and human) of the characters. It's not perfect; Smith is at her best when she's low-key, so she's not as effective when she has to really emote (though she is by no means bad when she does. Likewise, Vivica A. Fox is terrific as the single-minded and bitter Frankie; she was wronged and she wants revenge. Fox wisely doesn't try to get the audience to SYMPATHIZE with her (that sort of happens naturally), but she tries, and succeeds, to get the audience to EMPATHIZE with her. Queen Latifah is a strong actress, and despite being made nearly a decade before her Oscar-nominated turn in Chicago where she really make it into the big time, her performance here shows why it is a shame why her acting ability wasn't recognized earlier in her career. Newcomer Kimberly Elise shines as the shy, meek Tisean; she's so good it's hard to believe that this is her debut film performance, and her later work shows that it wasn't a fluke.The supporting actors are great as well. Blair Underwood finds the perfect note for Stoney's romantic foil. He's charming, but not smothering; romantic, but not straight out of a soap opera. He's intelligent, and knows he has nothing in common with Stoney. But he really tries to win her heart, and that's what makes him so likable. John C. McGinley is less successful as the cop who ties everything together. While he's not bad, in fact he's pretty good (his scenes where he has to admit his wrongdoings are terrific), he's not up to par with the other actors. But considering the strength in the performances by the four leads, this shouldn't be construed to indicate that his performance is subpar. Also of note is Charles Robinson, who despite being on screen for only two scenes, creates one of the most despicable and disgusting characters I have ever seen. He's so vile that his character sticks with you for a long time.This is not a chick flick. Despite what it seems like it might be, I can't stress this enough Set it Off is NOT A CHICK FLICK! It's an action movie, and director F. Gary Gray keeps it that way. He develops his characters so that everyone can grow to care about them. His direction is fresh and alive, especially in the action sequences which are expertly choreographed. This is a no-holds-barred action thriller and all the better for it.Set it Off isn't perfect. Some of the plot elements are quite contrived, and one of the scenes features a catalyst so dumb its appalling that someone didn't require a rewrite (even the cliché for what normally happens in this situation is more believable). Still, it's a great movie, and an excellent choice if you're looking for an intense action thriller.

They try to reason with them but then the security cop come is shooting and fatally wounding one (i'm not gonna tell u who and ruin the ending) it turns to total chaos and a high speed chase resulting in two more deaths.In the end only one girl is left with all the money that she doesn't even really want ne more and no friends because they were all killed. However i just wanna say one more thing.
