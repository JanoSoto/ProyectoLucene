I noticed that Bill Willis was the only father in the picture, Billy and Francis did not have fathers.  As a coming of age movie it really worked- for not only does Channe lose some of her innocence- it starts in the tree house- she also is able to accept her coming into adult status- as is evidenced by dumping the jock and losing some of her self-centeredness.  I loved the character of Francis- boy/not sexually threatening- yet freeing for Channe by the fact of his flamboyance. Most of the parts of this movie fit together well- there is enough dichotomy- the mother can throw sand in the sadistic teacher's face, but she also crumbles at the death of an unborn child.  Like us the characters are both strong and weak.  At first I was bothered by the lack of reference to Vietnam- then I realized neither Billy nor Channe would be that affected like those of us who lived through that period.  Most of all, Soldier's Daughter moved me to thinking how parents really influence their children. Any movie that foregoes bombs for thought is tops in my book.

In them, we learn a little about her character, though strangely enough, not as much as we do about her father, whose unconditional positive regard for his daughter does much more than delineate the characteristics of the relationships among the members of the family.The acting from the entire cast is superb, and from the actors' and actresses' demeanor emanates a very credible atmosphere.  Yet the one element that truly grasped my attention was the editing, which with the exception of a couple of segments, added an extremely high element of poignancy to the story.  James Ivory was obviously extremely assiduous with the film in this respect, and the final result consists of a strong narrative which appears somewhat terse, but knows exactly what quantity of what the viewer should be fed.Cynical commentary has argued that this film is nothing short of tripe because it lacks a resolute motive--it consists of no conflict at all.  All it is is disjointed scenes which serve no relevance to one another, and fail to tell a coherent story.  The former statement in regards to the lack of conflict holds true, but the latter is what might be deemed questionable.  Afterall, this is a story about the life of a family--and in a real family, few events from the past bear relevance to those of the present.  A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries simply seeks to discuss the development of relationships in a family;  events of high caliber are discussed thoroughly, while those of less importance portray to be all that they could ever be memories.

I kept wondering throughout just where the heck this movie was going.  It seemed to go off on various tangents, building mini-dramas, only to drop them at the last minute, leaving the viewer just hanging.  At first it seemed to be building a story around little Billie's adoption then it backed away.  Then it insinuated a drama based around Channe's encounter with the neighbor boy and then dropped it.  It continued this pattern through Candida's relationship, Channe's early promiscuity, and Marcella's growing drinking problem.  All leading up to Bill's death...which is treated in the same anti-dramatic style.  It seems to me that the whole point of the movie was to experiment using an anti-dramatic form and style where very dramatic episodes are abandoned just before the viewer enters the realm of real feeling.

The film is divided into three segments - Billy, Francis and Daddy. Each containing the protagonist Channe's experiences with three men in her life - her adopted brother, her school friend and her father respectively. The film shows how these experiences let her become gradually mature... emotionally, sexually and also in terms of personality.Acting is exceptional in this film. The first segment shows the time right after the brother, Billy, being adopted when he was 7 years old. Channe was also 7 at that time and the child actress who played her (Luisa Conlon) really deserves our praise. In the next two segments Channe (14 and 17 yrs respectively) was brilliantly portrayed by Leelee Sobeiski who is much responsible for the rather reserved nature of the character. Kris Kristofferson does a solid job as the father. His character is an unique one, as evident not only by the words he spoke, but also by Kristofferson's accent and expressions. Among the other actors Jesse Bradford is worth mentioning as Billy is last two segments. The actor who played Francis in Francis brings too much dramatic persona in my opinion. Though arguably that's one of the best things about the character. And there's also a nice extended cameo by Virginie Lledoyen as Billy's biological mother.Now about the characters and screenplay. Though stated from Channe's point of view, her father is the major influential character in this film. It was always his decisions, his outlook towards life that affected his family. The character of Channe is somehow very interesting. Her experiences with womanhood and men are written in an unique manner. And how she develops into a warm, soft-spoken yet determined personality is clearly something that Ivory spent time on. On the other hand Billy is a rather shy and quite unimpressive character with no apparent personal feature that should be rendered as a quality. Now Channe's school friend Francis has all the unusual features - he's an opera singer, loves to dance puppets, has a really corky sense of humor and his mother is an existentialist. His relationship with Channe is one of the film's major assets. All the characters are quite multi-layered, even Billy. The script is also masterfully written. A nice example is the conversation between Channe's father and her High School boyfriend Keith. I don't understand French that well so can't comment about the French dialogues though.Actually, it is a film that is bound to be enjoyed if seen in a special mood. I'm lucky that I had that mood when it was showing on TV. Also it is a film that grows wonderfully with time, segment after segment. It's a really good coming-of-age story that should be considered as Ivory's one of the best works.

American movies tend to be sentimental with plenty of scenes specifically calculated to make viewers get teary eyed. European movies, though, usually opt for a more naturalistic approach that refuses to wallow in emotions. In the case of Soldier´s Daughter, this characteristic can be both good and bad. It is good in the sense that the movie seems more realistic because one must admit that in real life, melodramatic conduct is not too common. Emotions seem to be hidden rather than absent and they actually do appear in small explosions like in the somewhat odd outbursts of the mother towards the end. Emotions also seem to be behind the strange behavior of the characters (e.g. the maid scrubbing the floor at midnight after breaking up with her lover or Billy acting antisocial to make up for his feelings of resentment). Howwever, there are quite a few scenes which should have been emotionally powerful but aren´t. A good dose of American sentiment could have made a difference. For example, in the one scene where Channe finally starts crying (the title of the movie is a saying her father keeps quoting at her), I understood the place of it in the plot but was not touched by it. When Francis, heartbroken, says goodbye to Channe after telling her his secret, the situation should have been heartrending but it also  left me feeling hollow - and this in spite of the fact that Francis, an effeminate heterosexual, was probably the film´s most fascinating character. Furthermore, the parents´ understated reactions often make it seem that they do not really love or care about their children the way everyone keeps insisting they do (is that a possible hidden meaning ?).     Otherwise, the movie is fine in the sense that it is intelligently written. Not only is it based on a novel but it feels as if it WAS a novel rather than a movie. The family is portrayed quite realistically. Even though the film does not seem to try to be artistic, it is lyrical enough to be seen as art.

The film suffers from dealing with too broad a sweep of time. Having to cover so many incidents in the life of one family, one gets a series of incomplete gesture drawings instead of a rich oil painting focussed on one or two subjects.I found that the characters never engaged me emotionally. The film never really let me into their world so that I really cared about them and what happened to them. So many plot threads were left undeveloped, and most of the emotionally engaging scenes of conflict were left out of the script. As an example, as Charlotte-Anne (Leelee Sobieski) develops into a young woman, she is frustrated as the family housekeeper/nanny continues to come into her room without knocking. The first time it happens, she yells at the nanny. Later in the film, she talks to her father about what is apparently a continuing problem. But we never get the logical scene where Charlotte-Anne confronts her nanny (which could have been played so many ways, and given such shading to Sobieski's character). Then, this thread with the nanny is simply left hanging. Emotions are stated as facts, they aren't really experienced in this film.

There are no consequences for any of the actions.The family is devoid of morals or values, and yet they lead an idyllic existence. There is little or no emotion between them, yet we are asked to believe that they are as close and loving a family as ever lived.

And in fact the film starts in French.  Yes, things do happen, but episodically, by way of illustration , not in relation to any central, continual story.What interested me in retrospect was WHY it's plotless, and what that says about the kind of portrait being drawn here.The film is putatively about the protagonist, whom we see from childhood through adolescence. But in fact it is a carefully drawn study of that classic ideal, the Honest and Just Man.  In this case, her father, based on the novelist James Jones (played by Kris Kristofferson, whose craggy face so suits the ideal in question that he hardly has to speak.)Most of the incidents serve to demonstrate one of two points that her father is deeply loving and understanding, and a bit unconventional (as is her mother), and that the family - which includes her adopted French brother - is close and loving despite being outsiders both in France and the US.  We also see scattered images of her sexual awakening (which includes some early promiscuity), but even these in the end say more about her father than her.The film's greatest strength is, in fact, this portrait of a family united in unconditional love, which endures even after the father's death.  This image - certainly a profoundly tempting ideal to many of us - lingers after the film is over and is its most satisfying element.  And in fact the film stayed with me well after I'd seen it, and I could recommend it to many viewers on that basis.But&#133;  why is a film with four characters, rich in emotion, devoid of a central plot?Because it's devoid of a central conflict.  The father is relentlessly understanding and loving; the daughter is relentlessly grateful.  Meanwhile , it's clear, even in this idealized portrait, that both parents drink (a lot).  The daughter's attachment to another outsider at one school and her sexual acting out at another are never really examined.  Yet they suggest something far more difficult and conflicted than a happy childhood.  Certainly, the known effects of growing up with alcoholic are barely acknowledged, much less highlighted.Perhaps this was a conscious decision, an attempt to avoid an aspect that of course is overdone in much contemporary drama.  But certainly it points to SOME drama at the heart of this family, some conflict that might have more productively been examined and used as a guiding thread. (Even the simple fact of adoring a 'perfect' father has its own inherent conflicts, as was beautifully shown in Eve's Bayou.)So what we end up with is an ideal, and certainly the hunger for ideals is real enough.  But here I felt too that it was a missed opportunity, an attempt to portray perfection at the expense of achieving resolution.

Leelee Sobieski proved to be a great actress starring with veterans Kris Kristofferson and Barbara Hershey.  Anthony Roth Constanzo gave such a stunning performance you'll wonder why this is his only film to date.  I'm not sure the novel would keep my attention as the film did but if you're chilling out at home on a rainy day it's worth checking out.

Starts well, with a French boy being adopted into the household of an expatriate American novelist and his family, and the conflict this creates with his daughter, who's about the same age. Then, after about 15-20 minutes, all tension in the film just drains away. Sitting through the last 1/2 hour of this was the toughest stretch of time I've spent in a theater in the last year. A movie so tasteful and well-mannered you'll want to scream. "},{"Title":"Eye Candy Is Not Enough","Date":"8 April 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  For me, this film came across as an anesthetized version of the vibrant, poignant cinematic experience that I'd wished for.  Again and again through this movie, one character or another in the Willis family is confronted by an emotional trauma whose climax and resolution are either ineffectively muted or left to be played out off-screen. This is a film in which nobody ever seems truly racked with sadness, anger, or laughter. In an early scene, Mr. Willis tells his publisher of the rawness and bloodiness of war; such ragged-edge scenes as he discusses with the publisher would have vastly improved this movie, tearing it away from the and artsy, too-tidy series of separately titled chapters that it was structured into. (The scene of the mother flinging sand into the teacher's face was one welcome departure from this.) Also, the development of romance between Channe and the football player is a real yawner; as soon as he flings down his helmet, it's apparent that he'll wiggle his way into her heart, as he's cut from the same iconoclastic mold as her beloved Daddy. Lastly, Channe and her brother are portrayed through much of the film as spoiled, listless whiners. Not the most interesting characters you'd want to spend a couple of hours with. Only the luscious photography and a serviceable performance from Barbara Hershey raise this to a two and one-half (out of four) star rating.   "},{"Title":"","Date":"18 September 1998","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This is one of those plotless films that is more portraiture than story - which is to say it's like many French films.  And in fact the film starts in French.  Yes, things do happen, but episodically, by way of illustration, not in relation to any central, continual story.What interested me in retrospect was WHY it's plotless, and what that says about the kind of portrait being drawn here.The film is putatively about the protagonist, whom we see from childhood through adolescence. But in fact it is a carefully drawn study of that classic ideal, the Honest and Just Man.  In this case, her father, based on the novelist James Jones (played by Kris Kristofferson, whose craggy face so suits the ideal in question that he hardly has to speak.)Most of the incidents serve to demonstrate one of two points that her father is deeply loving and understanding, and a bit unconventional (as is her mother), and that the family - which includes her adopted French brother - is close and loving despite being outsiders both in France and the US.  We also see scattered images of her sexual awakening (which includes some early promiscuity), but even these in the end say more about her father than her.The film's greatest strength is, in fact, this portrait of a family united in unconditional love, which endures even after the father's death.  This image - certainly a profoundly tempting ideal to many of us - lingers after the film is over and is its most satisfying element.  And in fact the film stayed with me well after I'd seen it, and I could recommend it to many viewers on that basis.But&#133;  why is a film with four characters, rich in emotion, devoid of a central plot?Because it's devoid of a central conflict.  The father is relentlessly understanding and loving; the daughter is relentlessly grateful.  Meanwhile, it's clear, even in this idealized portrait, that both parents drink (a lot).  The daughter's attachment to another outsider at one school and her sexual acting out at another are never really examined.  Yet they suggest something far more difficult and conflicted than a happy childhood.  Certainly, the known effects of growing up with alcoholic are barely acknowledged, much less highlighted.Perhaps this was a conscious decision, an attempt to avoid an aspect that of course is overdone in much contemporary drama.  But certainly it points to SOME drama at the heart of this family, some conflict that might have more productively been examined and used as a guiding thread. (Even the simple fact of adoring a 'perfect' father has its own inherent conflicts, as was beautifully shown in Eve's Bayou.)So what we end up with is an ideal, and certainly the hunger for ideals is real enough.  But here I felt too that it was a missed opportunity, an attempt to portray perfection at the expense of achieving resolution.
