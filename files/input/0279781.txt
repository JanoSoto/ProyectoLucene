My only response to those comments is, What were you expecting?  A moving piece of great proportions, likely to be nominated for 10 Oscars???This movie is nothing more than an attempt to make some money off of those who are fans of teen sex romps.  Those who walked into this movie expecting a sophisticated film, you missed the point!!!  This movie is about cross-dressing guys, it's supposed to be cheesy and lame; and that is what makes it so funny.If taken at face value and appreciate it for what it is worth, SORORITY BOYS is a laugh riot.  It is a usual sec comedy, but it is funny and clever at some times.  While it is definitely not the milestone movie for the 2002 year, it is funny and worth the time (if you like these types of movies).Lesson Learned Do not go see teen movies expecting to be moved, these movies are made for one reason and that is to make money off an audience.  For some good laughs, SORORITY BOYS rates a 6/10.

And in this case they've got not one but three, the first two of which are barely passable as girls and the third looking like the spitting image of the big redhead that Arnold disguises himself as in Total Recall. The whole plot is based on three members of Kappa Omicron Kappa (not exactly a subtly acronym) getting kicked out of their fraternity after they were set up and accused of stealing the alumni party funds. They need to sneak back in their old house to recover a videotape that will prove their innocence. Their first scheme is to dress up as girls and get in during a party, but they quickly get ejected by the dog catcher whose job it is to get rid of ugly girls. While still in drag, they are invited to pledge the ultra-feminist Delta Omicron Gamma sorority (another non-subtle joke) and, since they've no food, money or lodging, they accept. The rest of the movie is about their awkward attempts to keep up their ruse and fit in with a bunch of sorority girls, all the while scheming to get back that tape. Naturally, much of the laughs come as the girls are forced to adjust to their new roles and dealing with stuff like leg shaving and walking (badly) in heels, although in the process these formerly crude horndogs learn to start appreciating women as more than just object to either lust after (if they're hot) or make fun of (if they're not). Fortunately, they don't get too heavy on the feminist message stuff, at least not enough to get in the way of the humor. And there's a fun little love twist in which one of the boys starts falling for the sorority president, Leah. Her character's a bit of a modern movie cliche, like Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You she's supposed to be this bitchy, angry, ugly man hating feminist but is simply too good natured and good looking to really fool anyone. Of course, the twist is, as a boy (in her Women's Studies class) she hates him, but as a girl, she starts to develop feelings for her. Naturally, once she learns the truth she's initially outraged, but seeing as this is a simple comedy and not something like Chasing Amy, she quickly relents and all ends well. This is by no means a great comedy, it's definitely a rent, don't buy kind of movie, but considering I had no real expectations other that to get about 90 minutes of shut-off-your-brain entertainment, I must say it wasn't bad.6/10 "},{"Title":"Love the movie.","Date":"18 February 2006","Score":"20 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  ohhhh, look at this little handbag, this would go perfect with my shoesies! -Doofer/ RobertaEach character was so hilarious with all their roles.

With no money left and nowhere to live they disguise themselves as women and are accepted into Delta Omicron Gamma D.O.G.. A sorority made up of girls who didn't make it into other sororities. Now the boys are experiencing a whole new life, learning about how badly they've treated women over the years.

But I doubt anyone involved with the movie was under that impression in the first place. This is a funny college romp that made me laugh on a Sunday afternoon.

The frat is a group of insensitive stereotypes who get their comeuppance in the end.

I like Michael Rosenbaum and Harland Williams so I wasn't that disappointed.  Of course, after seeing the trailers I was expecting a D movie so it was actually better than I thought it would be.  There is quite a bit in the movie to offend people who like to be offended.  Personally, speaking as an ugly girl who would be kicked out of frat parties (although why any girl would want to be at a frat party in the first place is beyond me), I wasn't offended because I'm too apathetic to get worked up about the messages in a badly written movie.  What bothered me a lot more were the dropped plot points all throughout the film.  There are too many to mention so I won't.  It is also much easier for me to ignore the fact that the guys looked like guys and no one noticed- suspension of disbelief in favor of going with the main plotline- than it is for me to ignore the fact that they wore dresses and pumps and carried little purses to college classes.  Or that the president of the cool fraternity was such a complete dork.  Long story short, there are just SO many things wrong with this movie that if you aren't the type who can shut off the critical or easily offended portions of your brain and just enjoy Michael Rosenbaum looking pretty in a mini-skirt and heels (or skinny girls in wet t-shirts for some of you) then you don't want to watch this movie.

Sad to say the mix didn't benefit the film. Even Animal House looks like Hamlet by comparison.Barry Watson, Michael Rosenbaum, and Harland Williams are a trio of shallow fraternity boys who have the sexist attitudes so prevalent in college fraternities. They're in the creme de la creme fraternity and of course get only the best looking women on campus. It also follows that they treat the women in the feminist sorority like dogs. In fact the female fraternity is Delta Omega Gamma.But when they are accused of pilfering the fraternity funds and drummed out of the place, they realize that place's taping system where they record their sexual encounters might just contain evidence of who really did it. Our three lugnuts decide to go back in drag to the fraternity house for evidence, but when they get thrown out for not meeting fraternity standards, they have to keep up the pretense, especially when Melissa Sagemiller takes pity on them and invites them to the Delta Omega Gamma sorority. Our boys still in drag bond with the women in ways they never expected.You know the thing that struck me here is that Barry Watson has a nice growth of chest hair which was on display a few times on Seventh Heaven and other films. He shaved it here to keep the drag illusion going. Was this film worthy of that sacrifice Barry.Sorority Boys is strictly for the crowd that likes American Pie, Porky's, and Animal House.

Fortunately I was very much wrong! While the movie does have a couple of moments that reminded me of There's Something About Mary and more than a couple boob shots, it was all done in good fun. I never once had the urge to look at my watch and found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. It was great to see how typical guys would react to being in a woman's shoes (physically and emotionally) and maybe learn a little something about how they should treat a woman in return. All in all, it was a feel-good comedy, and by the end of the movie you saw a lot of character development. I can't say that I have made a *completely* unbiased evaluation of the movie, because my main motivation for seeing it was a certain Sexy Lexy of televisions Smallville, but all in all I found it well worth my six dollars and hour and a half. However, I don't recommend that *everyone* go see it. There are many people who are far too critical of movies and don't believe that they can be just for fun (you know who you are) but think they should have some deep philosophical meaning.

They need to get back into their frat house to get a video tape that will prove they aren't the ones that stole the money. So, in order to get in the house, they think dressing in drag will do the trick, plus they get free room and board at the DOG house. Of couse, the president of DOG, is a really hot blonde, who is supposed to be geeky because she wears glasses. Like we haven't seen that before.So, the few laughs come from the guys in drag in awkard situations. Such as when one guy takes  a shower with the hot blonde who can't tell he's a guy because she isn't wearing her glasses. As if! And of course, the uncomfortableness of them wearing dresses. And being hit on by some of their frat brothers. But, one thing I can't get over with movies like this is that the 3 guys are obvious male and not women, but everyone they see falls for the drag get-up. I mean, you can see their beards.And you know how it ends, the 3 guys who didn't think much of the DOG girls, think they are OK, and not such geeks after living with them.

Sorority Boys is a perfect mental margarita for the person who has had enough drama.  It's kind of brainless and stupid at times, but it's also really funny watching guys trying to be girls.  I was particularly taken with the performance of Michael Rosenbaum, who not only stole the show, (when the job was obviously Harland Williams') but made it more than fun to watch. Speaking as a female of the species, I was surprised that some women were offended by this movie.  So there are a lot of gratuitous boob shots, so what?  Personally, nudity doesn't offend me, the fact that none of the men are naked offends me.  If a woman truly considers herself a feminist, she must demand equal rights and not be afraid to back those beliefs up.  Where are the naked men?  Harvey Keitel isn't doin' it for me.

I'd call it a plot hole... however, really, there's so little going on to begin with, this is more like the inverted version of that. Even at the start, in one of the few attempts to solve the main conflict, they're going about it rather aimlessly, and it's unclear if that is supposed to be amusing or they didn't realize how lazy and obvious they were being.I should define our leads, even if the flick won't bother to. There's Doofer(Williams, awkward as ever), the stupid one. Dave(Watson, bland), the one who wants a girl he can have a conversation with - because at least one male in this has to be appealing. Has he found her in the smart and political Leah(Sagemiller, who is absolutely beautiful and charming, one of the few high points). And Adam(Rosenbaum, who's wasted in this; he does bring his usual intensity to the role)... he... well, at first it seems like he might be starting to appreciate unattractive women's plight...? No, apparently he's worried he won't be into chicks from now on. Mm. Compelling. Say what you will about American Pie and Road Trip, they had stuff happen, there were actual characters, and, well, they had plenty of laughs, which this is sparse on.This is really directed by someone who worked on The Simpsons? He evidently has no idea how to stage these situations, and the editing is dreadful - you can always tell you're looking at a series of separately recorded bits, they don't go together(a lot of the time, they forget to cut to reaction shots). The 86 minutes sans credits(90 with) pass too slowly, with too little built up and nearly no pay-off. There is one or two creative bits, and some random jokes that work. The lowest common denominator humor is more shocking than inspired(often, there are too many elements that are silly, and it's not certain what is even supposed to be the punchline - if anything), and of course fails to be credible in the least(no one is that unpleasantly honest about bodily functions).Ah, what of the message? It's ham-fisted and crammed down our throats in a manner ill befitting the crude teen romp, of course, still, it can get that right, yes? Nope. Like Shallow Hal and 50 First Dates, it plays to the prejudices that it's supposedly trying to conquer and the undesirables tend to actually be cute with merely one aspect off(remember, viewing public if your partner isn't perfect, that's plenty reason to dump them!). I won't even mention the solution, and not only because this is a spoiler-free review... this thing is so confused. There is a lot of sexuality(mild visuals, strong language concerning it) and a little nudity of both genders(breasts and butts) in this. I recommend this solely to those who can't pass up any entry in the subgenre. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Just Give It A Try...You Won't Be Disappointed!","Date":"30 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I have to admit; when I first saw the trailer for this movie back when it first came out I didn't think it would be good at all.

The few people who know that I like this movie are either surprised or aghast upon discovery. My suggestion is to roll with it and just enjoy yourself. Don't take it too seriously, even though there are serious undertones which gives each sex a peek into the other sex's world.Some of my favorite portrayals are of Adam/Adena, Doofer/Roberta and Spence. Favorite bits are Adena looking for a size 8, Roberta cleaning the hair clog out of the sink, and Spence using the paper plate mask for high council. One of my favorite lines is, There's mutiny afoot! spoken by Spence in that Bill Clinton voice of his. Thanks to the cast and crew for a fun romp!

The 'leader' of the frat is an annoying twerp who never would have made it into a frat to begin with, never would have made it out of middle school alive.  No they are not going to be intelligent enough to know the opposite sex's behavior, mindset, clothing trends, shopping trends, hell the curves of the female body to effectively pull off a drag routine for days.  Maybe if they just walked down the street once, but constant interaction?What bothers me is that not one person on the entire campus seems to know either.  Not even the female characters when physical contact is involved like simple embraces, etc.  Everyone I know is aware of the difference and properties of a stuffed bra versus the real thing.  The football scene? Shower scene?  Bed scenes?!  These people don't seem to know the difference between male and female anatomy--it's like the only reason they go after the opposite sex is because that's what they're supposed to do.

We have bad cliches done much better in the past regurgitated on the screen with nothing that makes it special, funny, or worth watching.At least Kevin Smith uses Jay and Silent Bob as a means to make wisecracks at whatever film they happen to be making, and his commentaries are so far buried and self aware no one viewer is ever going to figure it all out. Back to Sorority Boys, there's nothing to figure out.  There's nothing there.  Roger Ebert is right in his review when he says the poster is funnier than the film--it says all that needs to be said.

Oh, no.  The plot is to see how men (the Sensitive Guy, the Sex God Jerk, and the Clueless Neanderthal) would behave if they were thrown into the same situations on a college campus. All women's issues are addressed -- from bathroom usage to date rape. The date rape in Sorority Boys, a comedy, has ignited a few angry reactions, barking that rape is not a laughing matter.  Neither is nuclear war but no one seems to mind the jokes in Dr. Strangelove.  The rape victim himself is the Sex God Jerk who ends up being humiliated the same way as he humiliated his sexual conquest.  He deals with the same emotional trauma as a real rape victim (even denial). The Sensitive Guy thinks dressing in drag will give him leverage over a Feminist he adores.  Oddly enough, the Feminist rejects him as a male but loves him as the female.  She thinks she has found her true love unaware of the Sensitive Guy's false front.  How is that for absurdity at its greatest? The Clueless Neanderthal is a curious one.  He seems to have no purpose in the movie but he is important in advancing the plot.  He is the man everyone wishes would go away but yet there he is.  The Clueless Neanderthal remains and, in his crude way, becomes closer to females. The overall public reaction to Sorority Boys has been mild.  Viewers want to see T & A, not to have sexual stereotypes dispelled. They want mindless comedy, not a surreal dialogue about gender roles.  We want to see our women as sexual objects which is why we can only see Sorority Boys as a crude sex comedy.  The director used to work for The Simpsons so there is a lot of humor that isn't caught on a first viewing.  Sorority Boys lacks the cutting humor of The Simpsons but this movie does possess a deep motive than just exploiting bathroom humor.  Granted their are a lot of lousy movies with good message (e.g. The New Guy and Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo) but Sorority Boys has a strong story that wasn't haphazardly constructed. Besides where else are you going to see a mock Star Wars light saber duel done with dildos?

This movie is sooo bad, I don't know where to begin.  It's embarrassingly bad. Frankly, it's downright STUPID. This is a Hollywood movie, so it must have had a decent budget. But being creative with money was obviously beyond the director and producers' grasp. The three actors in drag are so badly made up with cheap wigs and unbelievable costumes that you'd have to be a complete imbecile to think that they were actually women!!!  I've seen community theaters do a better job than this. And all the characters in this movie believe that they are women; are they blind! Is it a star trek time flux!  After all, the movie does take place at a college as opposed to an insane assylum.  OK, so realism isn't one of this movie's fortes! I'm still flabbergasted that ladies who have commented on this movie didn't find the cheap comic exploitation of women (wet tee shirts, ugly girls referred to as dogs, girls with facial hair etc. etc.) in the film appalling! It's equally distressing to have to sit through the film's sleazy working of an audience's assumed homophobia. I wonder how many viewers stayed to the end of the credits for the big surprise cannibalism scene!!!!. Funny!  No.  Stupid! Yes!   This movie might have made a pleasant diversion with a better script and a better director. There's nothing wrong with the premise. The talented actors who play the lead roles must have had some inkling of how degrading the entire movie really is.

And I'm not sure what to make of the fact that in the end the main character thinks it's a good idea to set up the would-be date rapist with one of his new female friends.

The WB has yet to present me with any actor worth more than a few generous chuckles (excluding their current Friday night lineup). Plus, these three guys didn't intend on doing another Some Like It Hot and it shows.  And you can't blame their youth. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis weren't that much older than these three guys back in 1959. We just have to face it, though - Lemmon and Curtis looked like they spent weeks working on their female personas and these guys looked like they spent a couple hours trying out a few ideas in an uninspiring Adult Ed acting class.  The voices, the body movements, etc. are so lame to the point of obnoxious.So, if Lex Luther in drag doesn't completely weird you out, you might like this.  All I can say is that the WB seems to be going against the trend.  At one time, TV actors and movie actors were like East and West - the two never met (Except in made-for-TV movies).  Today, that overlap is quite common, e.g., George Clooney moving from ER to the big screen.

You can check... it adds up!Which is more than I can say for the Plot of Sorority Boys, unfortunately!Barry Watson plays Dave, a Senior in College with a Penchant for using women for sex and superficiality to excel in socitey. Dave heads the Social Comittee (having only 2 other members, Adam (Rosenbaum) and Doofer (Rocketman's Harland Williams) for his Frat Kappa Omicron Kappa (KOK, get it?). Their Frat Parties already include Animal House Style debauchery, group sex, and misogyny, especially culminating in the ejection of Dogs (members of the DOG Sorority... How clever!). The entire year is to culminate in a year end frat party with not only the current crop of idiots, but also the alumni (Including Dave's Dad... and some Animal House Alums). Naturally Dave, Adam, and Doofer are in charge of this water-bound Orgy as they are the Society Comittee, and the holder of all the thousands of dollars the KOK Frat has collected for this shindig!Naturally something goes wrong... in the form of the whiny Chapter President stealing all the cash to frame Doofer, Adam and Dave who are in REAL Control of the group!

Look honey, a movie AND Lessons.I don't want to ruin this for everyone especially because it's really not that bad (especially the aforementioned shower scene), but everything works out in the end, wrapped up in a cute little pink package!The good in this movie includes the premise. Yeah, like I said, Dustin Hoffman did it first and he did it better (don't even mention Tony Frakin Curtis, Whiners!), but this particular film took time out to attempt to shatter the damaging image College Aged women are forced to live up to along with decrying the Misogyny therein! Too bad it was handled in a Three Stooges Go Gay style film! it was great to see both Stephen Furst and Mark Metcalf in something besides Sci-Fi makeup. Sort of a nod to Animal House albeit a slightly lame one! Also in the good category would be the Brief yet memorable nude scene in the shower. Leah is HOT! Further, Michael Rosenbaum makes the best looking woman since David Foley left the Kids in the Hall! Most of the real laughs are at the hands of Harland Williams' Doofer. He just can't get used to being a woman and talking to women... hearing any woman, even one as ass-ugly as Doofer claim to be addicted to Porn and Masturbation is either HOT or Hilarious! You decide! Lastly, there is some really hot Lesbian Kissing that you can enjoy if you don't realize that one of the Lesbians is actually Barry Watson!

Also, Michael Rosenbaum's Adam is consistently referred to as a fat chick. Get real! He looked really hot, and I felt really uncomfortable thinking so. The contrived way that EVERYTHING works out in the end just seems like more of Hollywood's postage stamp cookie cutter endings. I think we're all used to these by now though!In short Sorority Boys isn't one of those films you should buy on DVD immediately, but passing an evening while watching it on cable can't be bad. It's better than PCU for heaven's sake!You know what? Maybe we should all get this on DVD! Yeah! Let's collect these from now on! Check it out!

Neither should we I suppose.The boys,(Barry Watson, Harland Williams and Michael Rosenbaum) have been kicked out of their men's, Fraternity House at University and in drag have been accepted into a women's or Sorority house. There they see things from a women's point of view. They become progressively feminised and perhaps turn into the sorts of modern men that most women would love to see.So much for the boring stuff in Sorority Boys. This is the sort of film that lifts when it is at its lowest. The homophobic elements become fairly amusing as do men falling about in short skirts and high heals. Cheap laughs are just that, easily won and if the P.C. cap is left at the door, as it is usually these days, Sorority Boys will provide some chuckles.Adam's (Michael Rosenbaum) tryst with his erstwhile little brother Jimmy (Tony Denman) at the Frat House was good for a giggle or two but it was hard to buy the rest. And it's obvious that films like Sorority Boys do little to entice people to behave more nicely towards one another.

No matter how serious a person can be, a plastic penis swordfight, or perverse sexual humour will at least elicit even the slightest laugh. Yet, upon watching the newest gross-out, perverse fraternity film &#145;Sorority Boys', one will emit laughter for the first ten minutes of this film that proves to be a sin to cinema.     This film might have been good looking on paper, yet if it were, none of that brilliance has been transplanted on screen.  While viewing the film, one cannot help to feel a certain sense of embarrassment for our three male characters who are forced to dress up as women in what deems to be one of the most antiquated thematic plots in film.       The film's wafer-thin treatment is written so as to have toilet humour as the main point of evolvement for laughter. Yet, what worked in &#145;National Lampoon's Animal House' does not categorically function on screen in this film.      Three college students are forced out of their dorm after the Fraternity's money is stolen. 7th Heaven's Barry Watson stars as Dave who becomes Daisy, Smallville's Lex Luthor played by Michael Rosenbaum portrays Adam, who turns into Adina, and under appreciated Canadian actor Harland Williams plays Doofer, who becomes Roberta. Out of all three, Michael Rosenbaum gives the most solid (If I can use this word for a film such as this) performance as a weight obsessed she-male. Evidently, Rosenbaum must have shot this film while on hiatus from &#145;Smallville'; his fake male hairpiece poorly hides his bald head. These three men when forced out of the dorm contemplate a plan that would give them free room and board and access to the Surveillance tape that would prove their innocence.     This film is a concrete example on the objectification of women within cinema and it sustains no minute detail of an actual shred of intelligence. I am fully aware of what the film's aim was; in addition I also am fully aware that I would be encompassed with twisted, perverse gags within the film. Yet, I was expecting to be treated as a viewer who had intelligence. Instead this film feeds the viewer stupidity repeatedly for a relentlessly appalling 90 minutes. The laughs end after the 10-minute mark because the remainder of the film recycles these same elements and attempts at milking our funny bone with the exact nonsense seen earlier yet in a different vein.     Director Wallace Wolodarsky fails miserably at capturing the essence of what makes some fraternity films a classic. While our three main characters dressed as women gain access to a rival female fraternity, more nonsense ensues.  Director Wolodarsky creates the most ridiculously convenient ideas in order to place our three male characters who are dressed as women in very sexual situations. One such example shows the contact lenses missing from one of the female's eyes therefore the woman cannot see a fully-grown man showering with her. This Director is fixated of showcasing flying plastic penises and foreign exchange students with hairy armpits that he loses track of decency and a molecule of intelligence.     Of course, there is always a moral tale to be learned. And while these three men were merely days ago mocking the same women who are housing them, they become acquainted with the feelings these woman harbour and in turn aid them at an uprising against the oppressor; the male fraternity.     If one were to dissect this film for it's cinematic elements, one would become slowly insane. What is even more insane is how a talented actress such as Heather Matarazzo (The Devils' Advocate, Welcome to the Dollhouse) finds herself tarnishing her resume with this brute piece of film. On a final note, the discerning viewer will realize when this film has hit &#145;rock-bottom'. When you have two of your main characters in a poorly choreographed act of swordplay with gag-penises, it leaves something to be desired.

The thing chugs right along breezily, with twists and turns and subplots and lots of likable characters. The premise, which is ridiculous, that three boys dress up as girls in order to gain entrance into a sorority, through which they will gain entrance (as guests) into a fraternity house, in which there is an important video tape that they need to steal in order to serve vengeance on a really evil frat brother who did them ill is nothing less than Shakespearean. Once you let yourself go with the premise, which is made easier by the high farce pitch of everyone's character, you can really enjoy yourself. There are many Midsummer Night's Dream type of encounters, like the lesbian sorority sister who falls for the boy in drag, but then has to decide when he reveals himself to be male if she loves about him/her beyond his/her gender. There's a delightful mishap when a frat boy, who only goes for dogs in order to deflower and then humiliate them, has an encounter with his older brother who, while in drag, becomes his next prey. The older brother needs to get the video tape from the younger brother in the frat, and they both have a plot involving rufies to knock each other out. This type of stuff had them roaring in the Globe Theater, both the groundlings and the patricians, and I found myself (a middle-aged English teacher) enjoying this happy flick right along with the teenagers in the house. I recommend it for its snappy plot development, lots of laughs and moral lessons, and lovely subplot resolutions in the finale.

The college looks like one of those typical colleges with all the usual dorms and frat and sorority houses, but what I was wondering was how these people got into the college in the first place; I know this is supposed to be a stupid comedy and not to be taken seriously, but it stretches it so far that you might wonder if these cretins could get into a community college in, well, any county in Oklahoma.Basic plot- Dave, Doofer and Adam get kicked out of their frat house after being accused of embezzling funds from the frat house safe, and figure out to get back in the house dressed up as chicks on a ladies night to retrieve a videotape claiming their innocence.  This goes awry when they get unintentionally thrown into the sorority house where the girls never guess once NOT ONCE! that the new girls could be boys.  But, I see, that's what's part of the joke of the movie.  Well, it doesn't work, and it goes flacid so fast it would make Howard Stern look like John Holmes.

Here they are not, although I had one big laugh somewhere. Unfortunately it was just one.For the stupid things we can start with the three guys dressed up as girls. Those things can be pretty funny but not when the three guys look like guys in women clothes. The movie has done nothing to actually make these guys look like girls. What is even more stupid is that we as the audience are the only people who see that, apparently.This is not everything. The guys who do not look like girls end up in a house where only girls live. You can say that these people are not the most beautiful girls, although one of them is played by Heather Matarazzo. Another one Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), who is sort of the leader of the group, is actually very beautiful and that girl is exactly the one who dressed up Dave (Barry Watson) is falling in love with. The other two guys are called Adam (Michael Rosenbaum) and Doofer (Harland Williams), just for the record.If this movie could be good in another way I don't know. I think the idea has some nice things and a lot of oppertunities. When they stop with the idea and try to do it this simple I feel a little disappointed. If you want to see a funny movie about a man in women clothes you better watch something like 'Tootsie' or' Mrs. Doubtfire'.

I saw this thing free at a screening and I still feel ripped off. I'd rather have done nothing. The plot is less than standard.

Those of you who see the Half Baked guy and like his movie, no, sorry you won't like this one and if you do, you smoked yourself retarded. It wasn't quite as bad as Not Another Teen Movie, but it ranks up there.

The thought put into this movie had to be done by people with IQ's rivaling that of peanut butter. Seriously, you've seen it before, there are better movies out (finally), and even if you like cheap humor and eye candy, this either does it badly or lacks it nearly entirely.

It wouldn't be  funny if the actors actually looked like women when in drag, would it.But this is the same old tired formula of men experiencing things from a women's perspective and becoming the better person for it. And along the way there are a few cheap laughs and the obligatory man-pretending-to-be girl getting p***ed off at someone/thing and resorting to violence scene. There's also the undercurrent where the boys help the girls to overcome their lack of self-esteem which is mildly offensive due to the implication that they couldn't have done it by themselves.It's not a bad movie, by any means.

That's as much as the writers seem to have grasped; even though I wouldn't have the first idea how to construct a screenplay, I think I could write a more pointed parody, of ANY viewpoint at all, while half-asleep and drunk. And this lazily sketched woman will turn out to be a major character.For the first forty minutes or so we're served nothing but old leftovers from the bottom shelves of the larder of popular culture, so stale and musty and unappetising it's impossible to tell when they were put there in the first place, or why.

I hoped it would be different from the recent explosion of aimless sex comedies considering the ample comic opportunities. Unfortunately, five minutes into the movie, when a Jell-O dildo crashed threw a window, I realized my expectations were incorrect. At this point, I knew this would be 94 minutes of pure, aimless sex comedy. Sex can be funny, sometimes, but not as often as Hollywood likes to think. Am I the only person getting sick and tired of these pathetic attempts at humor?The surprising thing about Sorority Boys is how much potential the story actually has. Harland Williams, Michael Rosenbaum, and Barry Watson play three members of Kappa Omicron Kappa fraternity who find themselves evicted from the KOK for stealing party funds. Somebody has a video tape of the incident, but very few people know it exists, and their ex-fraternity pals will not allow them back inside to retrieve it. After learning that the Delta Omicron Gamma house needs new members, they disguise themselves in drag in order to stay somewhere and concoct a plan to prove their innocence.  Even with potentially funny situations directly under its brow, the movie's humor resorts to characters tumbling down staircases and silly lipstick jokes. The script, by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge, desperately lacks imagination. The plot is so handicapped of ideas, it becomes wound up in a love story so out of place, even the actors involved look as if they think it belongs in a different movie altogether. Although we've seen guys in drag before (in much better movies), this film is not without unique humorous intentions. In one scene, two characters sword fight with large dildos; in another, the men in drag lead the DOG members against the KOK's in a game of football-they are the first three to hit the bench due to injuries. Again, these are funny concepts, but director Wallace Wolodarsky doesn't find a punch line. The idea of two guys fighting with dildos is funny, but watching them actually fight for five minutes is not. There is no moment when the audience identifies with the humor and laughs. The visualization of the jokes are so utterly stupid; the audience couldn't laugh at these sight gags if they wanted to. Sorority Boys simply expects us to laugh at the utter stupidity of the characters. But that doesn't work when the movie is equally as stupid.
