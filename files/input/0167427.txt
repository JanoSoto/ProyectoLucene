Just the uniforms alone are funny. And the characters of the Priests and Nuns are very funny, and reminds me of many of the teachers I had back in the day.Yes both Molly and Will were a little too old for their characters.

Comedian Molly Shannon portrays Mary as a klutzy, disaster-prone, teenage ugly duckling who has trouble fitting in at a stuffy Catholic school. Wearing dorky horn-rimmed, birth control glasses, she obsesses over kissing Mr. Right and attaining media super-stardom. The 'in-crowd' hoots at her, while the 'out' crowd adores her. Mary Katherine is the kind of stereotypical screw-up we are meant to laugh as much as love.Obviously, SNL producer Lorne Michaels felt there was something about this Mary that made her a prime Hollywood property. Some SNL characters, such as Wayne and Garth, survived the transition from boob tube to the big screen. Although Superstar qualifies as the comic equivalent of Rocky, this spasmodically unfunny farce proves that Shannon's character was better off on TV than in the movies. Almost as abysmal as Julia Sweeney's It's Pat The Movie, Mary Katherine Gallagher's bid for cinematic immortality wears out its welcome long before its flatulent 82-minutes buffoonery runs out of gas.A spin-off from the popular SNL sketch, Superstar depicts the outlandish antics of an orphaned teenager, Mary Katherine Gallaher, who lives in the ugliest house on the block in a small town called Besame. By the way, Besame translates as 'kiss me' in Spanish. Gallagher's hard-hearted grandmother (Glynnis Johns), who hates showbiz with a passion, struggles to keep Mary Katherine focused on a future as a businesswoman. According to Grandma, a school of hammer headed sharks devoured Mary's parents.The truth is that they got stomped to death on a dance floor when an accelerated record player triggered a nervous breakdown among their fellow dancers. As a result, Grandma wants Mary to avoid show business. Nevertheless, poor Mary wants to enter the Let's Find VD Talent Show sponsored by Catholic Teen magazine at St. Monica Catholic High School. The winners gets a chance to appear as an extra in a movie with positive moral values. While Mary Katherine dreams about super-stardom, her chief rival, Evian (Elaine Hendrix), a popular but mean-spirited cheerleader, devises schemes to humiliate our heroine.Bulimic Evian manages to keep Mary Katherine off the cheerleading squad and wants to prevent her from entering the talent contest. Meanwhile, Mary Katherine fantasizes about kissing St. Monica football hero Sky Corrigan (SNL's hilariously funny Will Ferrell) and stealing him from Evian. Evian mounts a down-and-dirty campaign to degrade Mary, pulling off all the predictable pranks when she isn't acting like a Heathers-bent-for leather ice queen.A Night in Roxbury scenarist Steve Koren's dumb and dumber screenplay makes Mary Katherine into a classic underdog heroine we can root for no matter how horribly the opposition treats her. Indeed, Mary Katherine resembles a teenage version of the woebegone heroine in Welcome to the Dollhouse. Of course, Mary Katherine will emerge triumphant after one too many setbacks, and the smug villains will get their just comeuppance. Unhappily, Superstar boasts few surprises, fewer laughs, and lacks the overall subversive hilarity of There's Something about Mary. Certainly, Superstar ribs the Catholic Church, but nothing as derogatory as director Kevin Smith's Dogma distinguishes this timid, status quo burlesque. They make fun of Father Ritley (a beetle-browed Mark McKinney) when he crunches his toast in front of several nuns ,and then orders them to find out why the toaster burnt his bread. Sure, Superstar provokes an occasional laugh, but not enough to redeem this nonsense. Mary Katherine is at her funniest in small doses. We chuckle when a nun catches her hugging&#151;as well as French kissing&#151;an oak tree. Or when she decks a nun with a high kick during a dance class. Of when she destroys everything around during a cheerleading audition. Her role as 'rewind girl' at a video store is worth a chuckle. Unfortunately, during the long stretches, she loses her spontaneity and imitates just about every other underdog that comes from behind to win despite impossible odds. The drawn-out confessional scene where Mary Katherine reverts to Sybil shows that somebody didn't know when to quit.Blame for stretching Mary Katherine's exploits beyond the two-minute warning mark into an overlong 82-mintue fiasco rests not only with Koren but also with Dog Park director Bruce McCulloch. A Kids in the Hall alum himself, McCulloch does little more than usher Mary Katherine from one stupid predicament to another. The spoofs of Carrie, Armageddon, and Jesus Christ Superstar grow pretty tiresome, especially Will Ferrell's 'surfer Jesus' set to the top hit Spirit in the Sky. The clash of the cliques plot is lame, tame, and pretty much the same as in Never Been Kissed, Can't Hardly Wait, and Drive Me Crazy. Nothing new here. Never mind, also that everybody looks about 20 years too old to be playing their respective roles. Happily, the veteran cast of comedians ignores the shambles of a script and maintains a straight face throughout this hokum. As Mary Katherine's grandma, Glynnis Johns gives a spirited performance. If Forrest Gump were searching for an ideal date movie, he'd grab Superstar.

From her beginnings, she has always been involved in interesting projects dealing with both comedy and drama, but always from the independent wing of the factory. Some of her appearances on TV Twin Peaks, Will&Grace, Sex and the City and the most popular on Saturday Night Live, performing one of her greatest characters Mary Katherine Gallagher, who leads this crazy movie. Besides, she also appears in Never Been Kissed, Happiness, American Splendor... It is not a coincidence that all the projects she is involved in are such recommendable. Warning Superstar is a freak movie. A pure freak film... freak enough to be a cult film. If you enjoy Family Dad, Kevin Spencer, Airport, Top Secret, John Waters' movies, Ghost World... you'll like this one for sure. That character , Mary Katherine Gallagher deserves an honor place in the comedy history. She's totally freak obsessed with being kissed. What else better than becoming a superstar for that purpose? There are all the necessary elements in this high school movie the typical religious school, 30-year-old playing teenagers, the mean blond girl, the cute-one (that has at least 40 and wears a wig!!), the freaks from the special education class and a talent contest. The movie itself maintains the rhythm , with hilarious moments, and it's so easy going that you can't believe it longs 90 minutes. Of course Molly Shannon puts all the attractiveness to this movie, her character is the freakiest thing ever. Once you have seen it , it will be part of your cult movies to watch with friends and laugh time and again. If you like it, it does mean that you are a freak. But if you don't, it does mean you are a freak , a freak without sense of humor.

It is a twisted past time for Mary Katherine Gallagher, a girl at a Catholic school wishes to be a superstar. She was raised by her wheelchair bound grandmother after her parents died. She attends a boarding school where she learns of a talent contest where the winner will be an extra in a film. Directed by Bruce McCulloch of Kids in the Hall fame with religious references that may offend. Molly Shannon is hilarious as this ridiculous female yet somehow we can identify with her longing for acceptance. Will Ferrell plays the popular jock whom Mary has her sights set on. He is a jerk who is responsible for much of the humour once the tide swings in the other direction and favors Mary. Harland Williams plays a biker student whom everyone fears due to rumors. While the role is limited, Williams pulls off an amusing performance that leads to insight as to why he connects to Mary. Glynis Johns plays her grandmother who sports hidden wisdom that allows the role to elevate above conventions. Elaine Hendrix plays the typical rival chick yet after Ferrell breaks up with her, the role becomes funnier. Its message of acceptance is one of real stardom when we can achieve it.

Coneheads is still the leader in the clubhouse in my book but this was still good.I'm not an SNL fan. In fact, the last time I saw a full SNL broadcast would have to have been 20 years ago or so. If it weren't for the internet and Yahoo posting some of their clips I'd never catch any of it.Superstar is about a very awkward and borderline mentally retarded girl that has only one ambition in life; and that's to be kissed by a boy. Because of her television and movie assisted upbringing she believes that the only way to get said kiss is by becoming a superstar. Her journey to superstardom causes her to do one highly embarrassing act after another. It becomes increasingly apparent that embarrassing is not even a part of her vocabulary.The movie is quite funny and delivers some good lines. Molly Shannon is probably the best fit for the role of Mary Katherine, the socially underdeveloped teen. Although, Shannon passing as a teen was about as believable as Channing Tatum passing for a teen in 21 Jump Street. Be that as it may, if you like the SNL skit you'll probably love this movie.

As we see in Superstar, some of these outsiders, like Mary Katherine Gallagher (played by Molly Shannon) and Helen Lewengrub (played by Emmy Laybourne), have a heart of gold.Yes, some of the things Mary Katherine does and says are funny, but it is not the main show nor the main point She wants to prove to herself and others that she is worthy of respect and love. She knows how good she is. When she realizes that she is seeking fame for other's approval, however, she rights her motivation, and continues on to a stellar performance at the talent show.This spiritual instruction by her grandmother, played by Glynis Johns, deserves special mention, because her character, although handicapped and in a wheelchair, proves that she still has much to offer Mary Katherine and the world. Pay attention to this movie and listen to what it is telling you about finding your own heart and soul and defending it at all times and at all costs Dare to dream and to pursue those dreams. Also, make sure it is your dream and not someone else's.I would have done a couple things differently in Superstar, had I been directing Sorry, Bruce Any movie with spontaneous, choreographed dance scenes is all-the-worse for it. Why? It is impossible. It makes no sense. Where and when did the students in the cafeteria rehearse this number? It makes me want to puke more than Evian pukes.Also, Mary Katherine's act at the talent contest should not have been interrupted by the record getting pushed to 45rpm. That was just stupid, and it consumed the time that could have been devoted to Mary Katherine doing some more funny and entertaining stuff on stage. Will Ferrel's appearance as Jesus Christ was particularly cool and funny. Slater took it pretty calmly when confronted by the King of Kings, on the road out of town! Very funny.I enjoyed the character of Slater, and think Harland Williams did a great job playing this complex-yet-simple character. Especially touching was the scene when Mary Katherine told him she (still) wanted a kiss from Sky (Will Ferrell), and Slater, though hurt, politely told her good night, and left.An especially candid statement was made by Mary Katherine, to Slater, at the pool Sometimes, I just hate the way I am. Molly Shannon does a great job of lighting up when Slater told her she is beautiful. This movie is not a comedy, and anyone who has ever been isolated, insulted or made to feel sub-par by a group will recognize this fact.If you are one of the drones who make others feel bad to make yourself feel good, you will despise this movie. Please think twice about the psychological effect you have on others.There are not many movies I can think of that I consider important. Superstar is an important movie because it speaks for the outsiders Those who have had to do things by themselves with little or no help, despite over-whelming odds.Right now, you may wish that I was savagely ripped apart by a school of hammerhead sharks, but I figure.., if Steven Tyler thinks Mary Katherine's hands smell pretty good after being in her armpits.., then maybe we underestimated her. If someone in a wheelchair can organize a stage show like that.., then maybe there are superstars all around us.

There wasn't one moment I DIDN'T laugh. I absolutely LOOOOOVE Shannon. She is nerd comedy precisely where the late Gilda Radner left off (before her demise). What more can I say about her? This film is not ONLY her SNL alter-ego 'Mary Catherine Gallagher', but her real-life personality as a former Irish-Catholic schoolgirl. This film basically depicts her former real-life experience growing up in Catholic school education, but from a modern-day perspective, and with hilarious side-kicks. Will Ferrell is perfectly cast as the football hero hunk who is 'broken up with Evian. We're dancing in the contest. But we're still 'broken up'. Genius! And talk about the choice of Harlan Williams as the mystery biker hunk??? Oh babeee. He made my heart melt to goo. What woman wouldn't want this sexy mute (stuttering) pulling up to rescue her off to a pool for a swim? (somebody STOP me!!!) Especially in the special ed classroom scene when Helen (the women's basketball giant) is briefing Mary on the other kids, and biker hunk walks in. He scribbles his name on the attendance card 'H E R E', then catches Mary looking at him, and shoots her a glance, almost wiggling his eyebrows (!!!) I about died laughing - the response on Mary's face.Elaine Hendrix is delicious as the stuck-up, booby cheerleader Evian - 'I think I just might wanna kick yer a**!'. Amazing how many grown up actors can pass for teenagers in this movie!! But Hendrix is double-funny as Evian ('you should be embarrassed....you're parents named you after BOTTLED WATER---'), especially in the scene where she calls her cheerleader stuck ups, 'it so wasn't your fault, Evian' 'Thank you -- I KNOW'. If any former nerd girl can't relate to that vignette, than she is not from THIS planet.My family has told me repeatedly that this movie reminds them so much of me, as a girl. That I WAS Mary Catherine, growing up in my teens. The unattractive nerd girl, whom everyone made fun of in high school (even if I didn't attend Catholic school), and became friends with the 'outcasts', like Mary did. That I was very much a 'dreamer', much like Mary Catherine. And that I only desired a normal 'kiss' like in the movies, just like Mary Catherine does. The only exception there was never any hunky biker mute that I ran off to a public pool with, nor wanted to bag the football hunk, nor did I go around school grounds kissing trees (and being caught by the nuns). But the rest of the plot is amazingly similar, far as desiring to run off to Hollywood, like Mary Catherine does.This film is an absolute must-see. And from a religious standpoint, really does not offend anyone, religious or not, far as the God-scenes go. Shannon's team did a wonderful job in creating the God presence, in more of a modern, relaxed - but not overbearing way (Will Ferrell), which should please any movie fan.This film is not screwball, dopey, or bathroom, stupid humor, nor low-class. It is simply PG sardonic comedy, with a touch of physical humor (the scene where Shannon/Mary breaks down the confessional doors after her slapstick monologue venue 'I'm not a slut! I'm not a slut!

She now joins the ranks of the many SNL sketch characters on the big screen, with disappointing results. Most of the sketches that have been made into movies suffer from a fairly simple problem taking five minutes of sketch material and stretching it to an hour and a half. Some writers are able to develop the character and surround them with an interesting plot, but this film fails on both counts.Superstar revolves around Mary Katherine Gallagher, a Catholic high school girl with big dreams and a serious lack of social skills. An outcast at her school, Mary dreams of getting kissed just like she sees in movies, and the only way she can envision it happening is by becoming a superstar. The object of her affection is Sky (Will Ferrell) the most popular guy in school, and the best dancer. Standing in Mary's path is Evian (Elaine Hendrix), Sky's girlfriend blonde, bitchy, beautiful, and a great dancer. Mary's opportunity for stardom and popularity arises when her school hosts a talent competition, with the winner getting the chance to be an extra in an upcoming movie. In some comedies predictability is comforting, but in Superstar it turns into annoyance; anyone who has seen Flashdance knows the story already. The characters are fairly standard as well Tom Green as Sky's sidekick, Helen (Emmy Laybourne) as Mary's nerdy friend, Slater (Harland Williams) as the cute mysterious guy with a Harley. Mary even has a wheelchair bound Grandmother.  Will Ferrell's character Sky is the only one who offers something new.Those familiar with SNL know how funny Ferrell is, but he is a surprisingly good actor as well. Sky is different from the normal 'Mr. Popularity' role, and the change is refreshing. Instead of being an insensitive jock, Sky is very feminine and sensitive, with hilarious results. When asked who was the most naturally funny comic on SNL, Shannon immediately said Will Molly Shannon wrote all the material for Superstar involving Mary Katherine Gallagher and Steve Koren (SNL, Seinfeld, and A Night at the Roxbury) created the rest of the story and the other characters. Shannon's talent shines through in the solo scenes; without having to worry about plot or other characters, her comedy is at its best. A scene with Mary talking to her own breasts is extremely funny, and shows the potential Superstar has. By the end of the movie though, Mary's character is too pathetic, and the audience ceases to care whether she gets kissed at all. The problem with Superstar is in the writing. As opposed to a good SNL spin-off, such as Wayne's World, Superstar takes on a cheesy sitcom feel as the movie drags on. By the end of the film the viewer is bombarded with Cosby show values on having dreams, being yourself, and knowing who your friends are.Essentially, Steve Koren dilutes Shannon's edgy comedy to make it appeal to a wider audience, but in the process takes away the heart of the movie. When asked whether she wanted to do movies or television in the future, Shannon said it didn't matter because, what's most important is working with good writers. Obviously the writing team for Superstar wasn't good enough. Kids in the Hall fans may see hope in Bruce McCulloch directing Superstar, but aside from a few dance scenes McCulloch cannot inject anything into the weak script. Shannon notes that Bruce McCulloch is really into the robot...and would would keep adding scenes with the robot dance. It seems his addition is simply based on his membership in the Lorne Michaels SNL family.Hopefully in the future Shannon can throw the SNL monkey off of her back and make comedies that challenge the viewers instead of simply making them drowsy.

One of its mistakes is the actress chosen to portray Mary; don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Molly Shannon, but it was evident that she was much older than her character-- mainly if you've seen other of the projects she's been into in the twenties. For some moments, I noticed many similarities with Never Been Kissed, even if they were released in the same year. I mean, what was going on with American cinema back then? Lack of authenticity, maybe? However, I may be not too critical on that, considering that such subject wasn't THAT saturated as it is nowadays. I'm talking about the weird girl that wins the prom contest or something similar in the end. Also, I admit that the few references to Carrie felt very funny, even if they made clear the movie's overall cheesiness.

Her parents died when she was young, her Granma Gallagher (Glynis Johns) who wanted Mary to become a Business Manager.But Mary didn't want to become that, she wanted to be a SUPER STAR!!!! Mary was also a girl who went to St. Monica's and she tried out every star making activity. It sure is HARD when you get going! Especially when you see competition. For example, the school's most beautiful girl named Evian Carrie Graham (Elaine Hendrix)upset Mary due to seeing her as competition in the bathroom and then, Mary SNAPPED the cow's bra. WAY TO GO, MARY! And Mary worked at a video store to know how super stars looked. There was such a funny scene when Mary came to confess in the church, she broke down the doors when acting out her monologue. Mary also knew a guy at school named Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell), the best dancer in the school and she had a close friend named Helen Lewengrub (Emmy Laybourne) who was a good basket ball player. And a new boy named Eric Slater (Eric Williams) who was totally into her.Soon, Mary heard about a contest about starring in a movie with Positive Moro Value as an extra. Mary could just imagine becoming famous. Another funny scene when a boy named Howard Feinstein (Jason Blicker) was rubbing two ruby grape fruits with his hands to attract Mary's attention, and Mary responded by picking up a banana and squeezing it to death! And Howard left her alone. HA! HA! HA! The next day, Mary approached Evian because, she wanted to enter the competition. And Evian bullied Mary in a verbal way by saying she could not enter the competition and saying her parents died because she was so ugly and then, Mary bullied Evian back by saying  At least I wasn't named, after a bottle, of water. And then, Evian tried to attack Mary and Mary beated Evian up by punching her in her boobs, kicking her about and then she dragged her out by her hair screaming. And, Evian was suspended! HA! Serves that COW right! Not so soon, Sky broke up with Evian due to that incident with Mary. She screamed so loudly, that she broke the glass behind the basket ball net and she fainted. Well, she deserved her boyfriend to be taken away from her! And soon, Evian took out her frustrations out on Mary by dropping a tin of paint from the ceiling (Carrie style). This happened just after when that devil-praising Gothic girl Maria Ganitisis (Jennifer Irwin) performed a satanic, dramatic song. You should've seen it, IT WAS SO FUNNY!!!! Suddenly, when Mr. Slater took Mary to the public pool to wash up after that paint incident. Mary discovered Mr. Slater was that little boy who she saved from drowning due to his birth mark on his arm. And it was so lovely to see them have a romantic time in the pool. And when she got home, her gran told her that she won the contest, and she helped her out in order for her to reach for her dream. So, Mary invited all her friends around so they could rehearse. And it SO cool seeing the gran playing the drums!!!! Later, the big night came, and they performed their hearts out, I just loved those fantastic, ruby, glittering costumes and with Jesus (Will Ferrell) going  O-OH! O-OH! That was so awesome to see Jesus loving music and saying Get jiggy with it. And then, MARY WON!!! HA! Ha! Evian didn't know she was competing against a SUPER STAR!!!! It was so sad that Mary decided to let Sky go, but she fell in love with Slater. And to end the review with the last laugh seeing Mary kissing a tree in the school yard with a nun watching with great concern! HA!HA!HA! P.S- I am sure this movie has reflected on many people's lives when they wanted to become famous, especially on mine. But I know it will happen.

The movie ended right before it became tired, and I must say that I was impressed by the storywriters because it is often hard to come up with an 80 minute movie from a 5 minute skit.  Wayne's World probably did the best job when it came to coming up with material but Superstar did an admirable job.Molly Shannon did a rather good job in bringing Mary Katherine Gallagher to the movie screen and the supporting characters were subtle and devious in their roles.Overall this movie is completely ridiculous and unintelligent.

This movie was not meant to be the comedy of the decade, there are enough movies that are over-hyped, over-budget, and over-done that attempt to claim that title already. This little movie is just silly, and fun. Molly Shannon plays her SNL character Mary Katherine, along with Will Ferrel. The plot is simple enough - Molly and Will are students at a catholic school, and Molly (Mary Katherine) is battling for the attention of Will (Sky Corrigan) who is more interested in the cute Elaine Hendrix (Evian Graham). You might remember Elaine from her role in Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.Glynis Johns, of Mary Poppins fame,  plays Mary Katherines Grandma. For you movie buffs out there, you might be interested in knowing that Glynis is the real-life daughter of Mervyn Johns, who played Bob Cratchit in the 1951 version of Scrooge with Alastair Sim. She helps teach Mary Katherine how to dance and sing so she can win the school talent contest, with the main prize being a trip to Hollywood, and a bit part in a major motion picture.Thats about it for the plot. Kind of like a Three stooges short. Just enough plot for the fun to unfold, and it really does. Nothing serious here folks, just one silly skit after another. You can tell right from the start, this film was just meant to be fun. Ever been flipping through the channels and run into a Three stooges short, so you stop and watch just for a few laughs?

Superstar isn't one of them. 	The director of Superstar is not very important, at least compared to the producer Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live. Of course, this movie is based on sketches featuring a recurring character, Mary Catherine Gallegher (played by Molly Shannon).  She is most known for her moves and for her habit of putting her hands under her arms and then smelling them. It is easy to understand why Mr. Michaels would want to keep capitalizing on his SNL sketches.  After all, both It's Pat! and Night at the Roxbury did great at the box office (enter sarcasm here).  Now I'm just waiting for the movies The Spartan Cheerleaders and The Bill Brasky Story. The movie focuses on Mary Katherine as she goes through her school years at a Catholic school.  Her lifelong dreams have been A. To kiss someone the way she has always dreamed about, B.  To be a superstar, hence the title.  She has worked on this dream mainly by working at a video store and rewinding all the tapes and watching how everybody does stuff in the movies.   References to Carrie abound in this story.  During a key scene, I found myself saying They're all gonna laugh at you. Anyway, Mary's main goal is Sky (I think that's how it's spelled), who is played by SNL veteran Will Ferrell, who later in the film plays Jesus (no, I'm not joking).  The only problem is, he's dating the head cheerleader, Evian, who by the laws of teen-oriented movies is must be snotty and mean to the heroine or else suffer a 5-minute penalty.   Mary is placed in the Special Ed class with a wannabe drug addict, a gothic chick, a obsessive-compulsive guy, and a strong, peppy girl who becomes Mary's best friend.  One of the other member's of the class is the silent kid, Slater, who takes a special interest in Mary Kate, much to her dismay. Anyway, this movie has the predictability of a sunrise.  Everything is expected, nothing new ever occurs.  What could be worse? How about if it isn't funny?  The gags are all pretty stupid, which is to be expected in an SNL movie.  The only time I laughed was when Mary Kate's dog was squashed to death by a television.  Yes, I'm morbid, but it truly was the only funny scene.  However, it doesn't do anything for the movie, and five seconds later it is like it never happened.  Sigh. 	This movie was better than I expected, but then I expected something worse than The Avengers.  That's hard to achieve.  All I can really say is, that if somebody asks you to go to a movie with them, don't see Superstar.  I have much better suggestions, and you can ask me for them at some point.

This film had some good moments and couple of laughs, but in general it is way below average when it comes to comedy.  The main character played by Molly Shannon is such a twisted young girl that no sympathy is possible for what ever happens to her.  Bordering on playing a mentally challenged person, while making fun of it, just doesn't work.  There is a great confusion as to what she is after, as sometimes she seems to only want to be kissed (like her last film before this one -> Never been kissed), and sometimes she is after fame and stardom.  Her character is also mixed up, as she plays it sometimes as being beyond help, with endlessly doing something stupid, while at some points she seems very mature for her age (discussion at the pool w/Eric Slater).

And even though that duration is a blessedly brief 86 minutes, it is safe to say that every single one of those moments is a veritable torture to sit through.I must confess that I have never had the privilege of encountering Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine Gallagher character on TV's Saturday Night Live; however, on the basis of this film alone, it is safe to say that it is a character completely lacking in charm and likeability.  Do we really need yet another in a long line of films built around over-caricatured teenage nerds who go to desperate lengths to fit into the snooty upper tier of their snooty private school setting?  The problem with `Superstar' is not that it lacks energy but that it mistakes inexplicably weird behavior for satire.  For instance, having a young lady behaving seductively with trees and stop signs makes no sense when the sole driving force of that girl's life is to fit in.  The audience, rather than finding her plight humorous and touching, simply loses patience both with the character and the film as a whole. It is simply impossible to overstate the complete comic failure of  `Superstar.'   The characters are dreadful, the slapstick antics lowbrow and laborious, the acting strained and amateurish.  However, in all fairness to the actors trapped herein, one must acknowledge that they have been given pure offal to work with.  What a shame especially to see comic veteran Glynis Johns reduced to so low a level. Yet, it is equally doubtful that any of the budding young `superstars' caught in this mire will be any more anxious than she to keep this particular film on their career resumes.

It's bad, and I liked it, and I refuse to apologize for that.Technically, it's bad for the standard reasons  unrealistic acting, pretty predictable plot, yedda yedda.  It's good because, to my mind, the cast and crew knew of the weaknesses and decided to hold up a mirror to teenage ostracism and oddities within that framework.I first saw this film while eating at a restaurant  it came on TV, and the only reason I left is because I was on my lunch break and had to get back to work.  I was spellbound.  For all this movie's faults, Molly Shannon knew what she was doing.  She made such a ridiculously lame and pathetic character that pretty much anyone could laugh at her, and yet took pretty much every piece of embarrassment and paranoia regarding teen years and trying to fit in, stuffed them into this movie and also made a character who I could sympathize with while thinking, well, at least I wasn't _that_ bad.A friend of mine actually gave me kudos for being able to sit through this movie for those very reason.  She just *won't*, for fear that she'd die of embarrassment if she did.

However, the very element which got this film the greenlight-its casting of the brilliant Saturday Night Live players who made the characters popular in the first place-is also what kills it as a feature film.  It is simply too difficult to get into a story about teenagers when all the major roles are played by actors  who are each pushing 40. On a TV sketch show, where everybody plays anybody, it's acceptable.  This kind of suspension of disbelief is not so easily earned in a feature length film, though. If the filmmakers were actually interested in making a good film, they could have gone one of either two routes #1 They could have presented us with a sequel of sorts to the TV skits-a few quick, carefully-lit scenes with Molly Shannon as a teen, followed by the main story featuring a grown-up Mary Catherine Gallagher, still acting oddly.  #2 A bolder move still would have been to have let Shannon script the film, but to have cast a real teenager in the role of the character she created--perhaps someone like Heather Matarazzo from `Welcome to the Dollhouse.'But we all know that these SNL films are nothing more than a simple way to cash in on a craze.

Then I thought about it.  I decided to view this film not because I expected it to be a quality film with all that goes with such distinction, rather, to just have some mindless entertainment.  Once I realized my own intentions, I was able to look at this film for what it really is--mindless entertainment.  There is no genius here.  There is no great script or acting ability involved.  However, keep in mind the film is a comedy and often we expect such films to be comparable to dramas and the like that often are distinguished as quality films.Now, as a comedy, a different set of rules apply.  We can't expect everything to make sense and we have to suspend our own judgments and values when watching such a film (the same way as when one watches The Naked Gun films).  In doing so, one can appreciate Molly Shannon's work here.  She is a nut!  She is crazy!  She is pure joy to watch as the title character, Mary Catherine Gallagher.  Hers is not an Academy Award caliber performance, but it is more enjoyable to watch then say Jessica Lange from Blue Sky (a torturous performance in an unbearably watchable film).Her performance sets the tone for the rest of the film.  Most of the characters have nothing to offer, but Molly Shannon goes from charming and sweet, to vicious and vindictive.  With relative ease, she quotes monologues from made-for-tv movies that are outright hilarious while trying to play off the insecurities that her own character possesses.  In doing this, she somewhat pulls off an acting coup by making her character as eccentric and difficult to really understand as one of the monologues she exhibits (Sally Field's performance in Sybil).Don't get me wrong...no one will mistake this film as comparable with some of the great comedies of all-time (Some Like it Hot and others), but we must look at what the film is trying to accomplish.  I can't imagine that the creators figured that this film would do anything more than provide a few gags.  In that mindset, it becomes amazing to me to realize that this is really a powerful vehicle to showcase Molly Shannon's performance.With the right material, better script and dialogue, hers could be a true comic performance.

Possibly it was funny the second time we saw it (the next week, I'm sure) just for verification. But that was a few years ago and thumbs in armpits only goes so far. It certainly doesn't go far enough to carry this movie. I expected the basics of the Mary Katherine Gallagher character such as thumb-smelling, pratfalls, and cheerleading poses, to be repeated ad infinitum in this film. Strangely, they were kept pretty much in check the whole time, which means that not much happens, funny or not. Will Ferrill, who has some potential, is always present but plays a rather subdued dude. Usually in plot-thin movies, effects or action will attempt to fill the bill. Neither really happens here. The movie starts, some stuff occurs in the middle, and then it's over. Just like SNL every week, it seems as if the writer and director just shrugged their shoulders and said, well, there's always next week.Two points noteworthy Mary's grandmother is played by Glynis Johns, best known to me anyway from Mary Poppins where she was the suffragette Mrs. Baxter.

In his monologue he said Some of the worst films in history were made by people in this room.  It's possible that Rock screened Superstar prior to appearing on that show.  Mary Katherine Gallagher is yet another creation from Saturday Night Live to go the feature film route.  Like many of the films that have come before it, we see this SNL character go through the turmoil that is her life, in a one-dimensional plot, complete with silly characters that do little to back her up.  If anything, this is a vehicle to showcase the funny bits this character has been doing on Saturday Night Live for the past couple of years.  Mary Katherine was known for smelling her arm pits and revealing her underwear as she danced herself into a frenzy.  Unfortunately, these bits have become old and therefore do little to help this film.Here's the plot in a nutshell (and let me guarantee you, it isn't original).  Mary Katherine is a Catholic school girl who dreams of having that first kiss.  She believes that she must be a superstar in order to reach this goal so she emulates people she sees on television and in movies.  Her nemesis is the ultra-popular, ultra-whiny Evian (named after the water, perhaps) played by Elaine Hendrix.  Evian is dating Sky, a supposed big man on campus, played by SNL's Wil Ferrell.  Of course Mary wants Sky but her  plans are sidetracked when she is placed in special ed.  There she meets a cast of 'lesser-than's' who join forces with her.  Among the pack is strange boy who is rumored to have killed his parents.  Throughout the movie she looks at him strangely, and he looks at her lustfully.  The set up up is so predictable that I'm afraid what you have just read may actually be a spoiler.  I apologize for that, but trust me, its not my fault that this story has been done a million times before ... and in much better venues.  It seems obvious to me that there wasn't much effort put forth to come up with a half decent script.  I felt cheated after this movie because it seems apparent that all creativity and thought left this film after the initial idea to turn this tired skit into a big production.  On the other hand I wonder if the pairing of two Lorne Michaels divisions (Molly Shannon from SNL and director Bruce McCullough, formerly of Kids in the Hall) killed this thing.  Two completely different types of humor that just didn't mix?  Perhaps.  Whatever the case, I don't believe that anyone (with perhaps the exception of Molly Shannon) put any heart into making this work.  This was, in the end, simply a throw together for the sake of getting it done. The jokes are rarely funny.  The scene with Mary Katherine making out with a tree was perhaps the funniest, albeit we have seen it a dozen times in previews.  Other jokes simply don't make sense.  The dog dies and goes to heaven.  There he is greeted by Wil Ferrell playing Jesus?  What was that all about?  Mary Katherine attempts to display her feelings by reciting various monologues from TV movies (i.e. The Boy in the Plastic Bubble).  They are funny at first, but much too tiring for the big screen. Following the release of this film there was a lot of grumbling from critics about 'yet another dumb movie about a Saturday Night Live character'.  I love Saturday Night Live and Mary Katherine is a fun character.  I looked forward to this movie but didn't expect too much.  I just wish that going forward, that Saturday Night Live films might offer something in the way of real thought when putting together a movie about one of its characters.

This makes it a pleasant respite from movies which do exactly the reverse assuming much, and accomplishing nothing.  For a Hollywood movie equation, think  a female version of Revenge of the Nerds meets coming-of-age story.Mary is, like many of us, peculiar in her own way, and, thankfully, without apology; she neither toes the line of normalcy, nor anguishes over why she doesn't or can't, nor even questions whether she should try. Satisfyingly, she lives her own life in her own time and in her own manner, dealing with the ups and downs as they come, thank you very much.  Molly Shannon expands her familiar Saturday Night Live character with a seamlessly enriched set of quirks, web of characters to interact with, and believable details to explain many of her idiosyncrasies (standard 30-year-old highschoolers notwithstanding).  Of course, it doesn't hurt that there are plenty of laughs, of various shapes and sizes.  Contrary to the complaints of naysayers, the established SNL-skit hooks (randomly loudly crashing into nearby objects; introducing herself awkwardly; the are trotted out only once apiece, and to good effect; her propensity for quoting made-for-TV monologues is used a few times, but works well since each one is, of necessity, different.One gratifying aspect of the film is the fact that not only does it have a female lead, and not only is it a comedy, but much of the time a *physical* comedy at that, making it somewhat of a rare combination.  Some among us (for instance, the irritatingly self-satisfied and those who are aggressively normal) will fail to fathom, much less identify with, Mary's character, her history, or her world.  Such is their loss.Others who find endless fashionability in bashing all things SNL, regardless of the merit of any individual work, will no doubt take great glee in another target upon which to attempt demonstration of smug superiority.

The person to watch out for is Helen     (Emmy Laybourne - Mary Katherine Gallager's friend and side-kick). Her performance as the slow and aggressive basketball player, makes us think of Stan's sister on South Park (she's got the braces and everything). All in all, if you are looking for a goofy movie, or just a plain 'ol laugh, SUPERSTAR is definitely worth the hour and a half.

But suprsingly, that only happened twice.  I thought this movie was funny and kept the audience entertained, unlike some episodes of SNL. Some skits are just so funny, while others drag.  Luckily Superstar was not a 1hr and 1/2 skit. It actually had a plot and some refrences making fun of teeny bopper movies, which I thought was hysterical because I go and see all those movies!  Molly Shannon was funny as usual, and Tom Green was absoutely hysterical in Superstar.  During the course of the movie, you start to feel for Mary Katherine hoping she wins the talent show.  It may sound corny, but its true. The movie was not just a one-liner, it had a plot and a movie-ending. All in all if you like SNL, you'll like this and I certainely had an entertaining evening.

Don't get me wrong..I love Molly Shannon. She's a terrific physical comedian and actress..I've havent seen someone so appealing since the late Gilda Radner.  The Mary Katherine Gallagher skit on in its 4 minute format is often hilarious..and it could have made into a decent movie..but this movie makes all the wrong moves..the first one working with a script from the same guy who did NIGHT OF THE ROXBURY. What ever happened to the Bonnie and Terry Turner team who did WAYNE's WORLD....This movie is beyond predictable.. It's recycled joke quotient is almost as high as THE WATERBOY.  The jokes and sight gags and physical comedy in this movie all fall flat.. I mean...watching someone make out with a tree kind of gets old after the first three times. There are jokes involving a stepdancing sequence and Jesus that are disastrously unfunny. There are cameos by a lot of talented and funny faces..but none of them are given anything good to work with.  They don't have a real script..so they just stand around and make funny faces.  Sorry Molly Shannon...I know you can do a lot better than this... ur very talented..Anyway, avoid this movie at all costs..at least during its theatrical run... and wait for it to sell pre-viewed at clearance price at Blockbuster.

It has a few funny moments (which is more than you can say for most SNL films,) and the idea of a cast of 30 to 40 year-olds playing teenagers is kind of brilliant in it's own way, but it just doesn't work. When are they going to realize that plugging SNL characters into this tired emotionally-redeeming formula just doesn't work? How many flops will it take? This film may actually be popular among certain groups. The gaggle of Chelsea muscle queens sitting next to me found it far funnier than i did. So Gay men and some women may find it enjoyable. I was hoping Bruce McCullough would break from SNL tradition, but it turns out that he was not the genius of KITH. Maybe it was Scott Thompson.
