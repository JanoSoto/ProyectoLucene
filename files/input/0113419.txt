While I gave it a 10, I fully expected at least a mid 7 from the IMDb audience. It is a wonderful film that I love to show to my children. What's not to like? It has a unique plot - that of an Indian coming to life in a young boy's cupboard, and wonderful acting and music. Through the boy's experiences with the Indian (wonderfully played by Litefoot) he comes to a new level of maturity. Hal Scardino's acting is natural and totally believable. If you are tired of the cut-out child actors that Hollywood gives us too often, then you'll love Hal. What a fabulously underplayed performance. The ending always makes me and my wife cry. There are so few really good films for children. I hate to suffer through other films I bought for the kids (like Inspector Gadget - a truly awful film) and I wish that there were more films like this one. This is a wonderful film and I heartily recommend it.

In here is a wonderful neat-looking little kid, Hal Sardino, who is unusual in that this is the only movie he ever starred in. To his credit, Scardino went on to live a normal life after this film, eventually going to college as a regular student like you and me with no celebrity status.The film is anything but normal, a fantasy about a young boy who receives a cupboard that transforms little toy figurines - in this case, an Indian and then a cowboy. - into miniature real-life people. Each time he opens or closes the box with the figures in them, they change to either real or back to plastic.Scardino, who plays Omri, is fun to watch, if for no other reason than the great expressions on his face. He has to be one of the most likable children I've ever seen on film. Meanwhile, his best friend Patrick is the only villain, so to speak, only because he's a bit defiant, as his mother labels him and he almost spoils everything for Omri.It's a solid family film that is fun for both the parents and kids to watch at the same time. Both will get a lot of entertainment out of it. With just a bit of profanity early on and a bit of obvious political correctness, there is nothing in here which should offend viewers. Critics didn't seem to care for it, so you know it truly was a nice, wholesome film....and fun to watch.

Putting them all together, Omri locks the Indian inside the cabinet, only to be awoken by a strange sound in the middle of the night. Omri opens the cabinet to discover that the tiny Indian has come to life; it seems that he's called Little Bear (Litefoot), and he claims to have learned English from settlers in 1761. Omri hides this remarkable discovery from his mother but shares it with Patrick; as an experiment, Patrick locks a toy cowboy into the cupboard, and soon Little Bear has a companion, Boone (David Keith), though predictably, the cowboy and the Indian don't get along well at first. Omri comes to the realizations that his living and breathing playthings are also people with lives of their own, and he begins to wonder how much control he should really have over their lives.

He received a skateboard from his parents and an old cupboard from his brothers Gillon and Adiel. The cupboard looked interesting. Omri's friend Patrick gave him a little Indian figurine. The cupboard was missing a key but Omri's mother had a ton of keys. Omri selected a shiny gold one. His mother's grandmother gave it to her on her death bed. That evening, Omri placed the Indian figurine in the cupboard and locked it with the key, then he unlocked it and to his surprise, the small toy Indian had become a small alive Indian! His name was Little Bear and at first he was afraid of Omri who locked the cupboard and went to bed. In the morning, he unlocked the cupboard to find that Little Bear had become a figurine again. Omri was distraught. After dinner, he unlocked the cupboard again and Little Bear was alive again! The two soon became friends. Omri put a plastic teepee in the cupboard and it became real. Omri then got a bunch of his toys, including a Darth Vader figurine, a T-Rex, RoboCop figurine and G.I. Joe, placed them in the cupboard, locked and unlocked the door and saw them fighting with one another. He quickly transformed them back to toys and in the morning he took Little Bear outside. He wanted to build a Long House because his tribe didn't sleep in teepees. Little Bear was attacked by a bird and was hurt pretty bad. Omri snatched his brothers' toy WWII medic figurine and put him in the cupboard. The medic, Tommy Atkins, soon came alive and fixed Little Bear. He was then placed in the cupboard again and became a figurine again. Omri then left for school while Little Bear began work on his Long House.        At school, Omri snatched an elderly Indian figurine with a bow and arrow. He brought it home and brought it to life in the cupboard. The elderly Indian took one look at Omri and keeled over dead. It was then that Little Bear found out Omri was only a kid and became angry with him for using magic he did not understand. Omri's dad wanted him to run an errand for him and when he returned, Patrick came over and gave him a cowboy on a horse figurine. Patrick puts it in the cupboard and the cowboy and horse come to life. The cowboy was named Boo Hoo Boone because he had a tendency to cry. He and Little Bear begin fighting so they were separated. Patrick wanted to keep Boone so he made Omri promise to bring them to class tomorrow so walking very carefully, Omri brought Little Bear and Boone to class in a pouch. When Little Bear heard Boone was going to school, he wanted to come too. Omri and Patrick fight over them and nearly gave it all away. Omri asked Patrick to spend the night but when they returned home, Omri found his cupboard was gone. Gillon and Adiel had taken it. He found it in the crawl space but the key was missing!       That night, Omri, Patrick, Little Bear and Boone watch a film about Indians being shot at. Little Bear was confused and fired his bow and arrow--right at Boone! He desparately needed help but without the key, they couldn't get Tommy. Suddenly, Omri and Patrick noticed the key stuck under the floor boards. Little Bear wanted to go get it but had to be cautious because Gillon and Adiel's rat was loose under there. Little Bear successfully returned with the key so Tommy could come to Boone's aid. He fixed him up as best as he could and Boone would be okay. Little Bear and Boone wanted to return to their own times and Omri decided it was time for them to go. So they were placed in the cupboard, Omri locked and unlocked it and Little Bear and Boone were figurines again but Omri would never forget his friends and I'm sure they will never forget him either.      Pretty good movie. Although I think a backstory on why the cupboard and key are magical would've been nice. Although this film looks like Spielberg's work, this film was directed by Frank Oz. We all know him as the puppeteer behind such memorable characters as Yoda, Grover, Cookie Monster, Bert, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, etc. So if you're looking for a nice family film, I recommend The Indian in the Cupboard. A pretty popular scene is the one where Omri places figures of Darth Vader, RoboCop, G.I. Joe and a T-Rex in the cupboard and they fight with one another. In conclusion, I recommend The Indian in the Cupboard!- "},{"Title":"An excellent  film exploring complex themes lightheartedly","Date":"18 January 2005","Score":"11 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" This film was special.

The child actors' performances are solid. Especially the lead 'Omri', and his friend (whom I really liked and really disliked respectively - (hence his acting ability)). It's an innocent story with great imagination, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The relationship and growth that the main character develops with Little Bear (the Indian in the cupboard) is special. It eventually takes on a father/son dynamic after a role reversal or sorts from the Creator/created dynamic the boy has with Little Bear at first. I was touched by this relationship and by Omri's innocence. Frank Oz imagination is conveyed well through this work.

Then, I read the books. This movie strays very far from the book. The big problem is the fact that the books take place in England. And if you read the rest of the books, you'll know how important the location is to the entire story. The movie Americanizes Omri. The movie cuts out and replaces a lot of scenes as well. For instance, in the movie, Boone never sits in the art class drawing his microscopic sketch of his town...a scene that would play an big role in a book to come. Another scene they cut was the principal seeing Little Bear and Boone the way Omri and Patrick do...another big scene that follows them throughout the series. Perhaps they did this because there were no plans for sequels. However, it makes for a huge disappointment for viewers who had read the books before or ran right to the books afterward. The acting and casting for the time travelers, however, was wonderful. As I read the books, I picture Litefoot speaking all Little Bear's lines, Steve Coogan speaking all Tommy's lines, and David Keith speaking Boone's lines. I loved the special effects throughout the movie. The fact that all the others were Americanized causes me to realize they don't fit the Omri, Patrick, etc in the books. Overall, I say that if you enjoy it, then you enjoy it. But chances are, when you read the books, you'll find it a definite disappointment, as it is with so many other book-based movies.

A young boy finds out that his cupboard has magical powers and can turn plastic into reality. He first turns a plastic Indian into a real human being. The movie teaches about responsibility but in an understandable way. It isn't patronizing nor childish, which means older audiences should relate to it also. It also mediates on life and death at certain points, and was the first film in a long time to be genuinely emotionally shocking. The relationship between the Indian and the cowboy was very well developed as they started to bond over their tragedies. The film does have a number of loose edges. Rishi Bhat was particularly annoying at times, but in a way he was necessary to play off Scardino. Even Scardino wasn't always a lovable protagonist. In one scene he kicks his brother's pet rat down the stairs, in an event where the rat clearly would have died. As the film hadn't relied on cartoon logic up until that point it was a bit out of place. Great effects, and seeing Darth Vader vs. a T-Rex kind of made up for those moments. A more innocent time when children's movies didn't have to be loud and crass.

Otherwise, never see this film.Soundtrack 4- There were moments of soundtrack that worked, usually when putting in bits of Native American chants, but for the most part it was just bad.Script 4- There are so many plot holes.

Litefoot plays the wise Little Bear but we are given little if any background, but the plot gears towards his dealing with his size verses the world he now inhabits. David Keith is hilarious as cowboy Boone, and easily the film's best performance. Boone enters as a pushover but becomes peaceful after an incident.

Still, it was worth checking out.","Date":"23 February 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Now that I've grown and educated myself, I can't stop thinking about how politically incorrect the title is. People say it should be called 'the Native American in the cupboard'. This is a very very common misconception in America. Yes, for a while they were called Indians. Christopher Columbus did not call them Indians because he thought they were from India. He called them Gods people. The word in his language for God's people sounds very similar to the word Indian that we use today. It's just that the pronunciation we use now has changed a little after all this time. As for people saying that the correct term is Native American is highly offensive and frankly kind of stupid. How is it that taking the name from which the conquerors's gave them(American) supposed to be the correct term? That makes absolutely no sense. The word American has no relation whatsoever to Indian culture. Therefore Native American is utterly ridiculous, as well. If there is to be a title, it's should be call 'The Iroquois in the Cupboard'. No matter, what it is, call. The movie and book is not racist. The movie and book is trying to show tolerance through it's metaphor for how ignorant people have subjugated and marginalized the Indian populations of America by refusing to understand, listen to, or accommodate Indian heritage. The film opens up, a lot of things that people rarely knew about Native Americans. The film starts with a young boy, Omri (Hal Scardino), receives a cupboard. He uses a magical key, which belonged to his great-grandmother, to bring a plastic 18th century Native American figurine to life with the cupboard. The now-living Iroquois reveals his name as Little Bear (Litefoot). Litefoot, a real rapper does a great job in teaching role, not only in teaching the child about Iroquois's culture, but also the morality of playing God. There is a Frankenstein feel to the film. My favorite line in the film God does play with little men'. Author Lynne Reid Banks and Director Frank Oz did an excellent job conveying the worry and angst the young boy felt for for his little toy come to life. I appreciate how the author had the boy evolve from seeing the Indian as a plaything to realizing that, regardless of his size, the Indian was a person with needs, feelings, and a right to live his life. What struck me about it was not that it was racist, or dated (it didn't feel so as much as you'd think,) but that it is a deconstruction of the idea that magical toys would be fun to have, and possibly of imagination as well. Omri seem just the typical kid protagonist, kinda generic if you ask me. But I still think his acting was unintentionally funny. Just weird out with all the close ups on Omri's face, the odd relationship between him and Little Bear, the weird fears, and how he reacts to others. Examples when Omri's dad confronts him about the saw blades, and Omri says he buried them. Odd lying by him and his parent accept that lame excuse. What kid can cuss to his mom as well? What is with his relationship with brothers being super cool in the beginning of the film and then for no reason Omri turns into a complete jerk with him? The worst thing, the kid does is abuse an animal. That poor thing was abused through the whole film. Whether it was real or not, it was still animal abuse and shouldn't be shown in this movie. The treatment of that rat was appalling. Omri still wasn't nearly as annoying as his friend, Patrick. One minute he's Omri's best friend, and all docile and quiet, and then like a switch, he's evil and defiant with seeing them as nothing more than animated toys. He brings in Boone (David Keith), a bigot Injun hating cowboy whom at first conflict with Little Bear, but grows to be friends with him, once they got to know each other. One of the odd things about the film is scenes that go nowhere or has nothing to do with the story like the Mohawk bully. Another thing is the degrading of women in the film, from the kids watching Montley Crue 'Girls' music video (it's the 1990's, why were they watching it anyways?) to Bear demanding a wife so she can cook. I put aside my critiques and squelched my inner squirming and found much to like about the film. The special effects were top notch, and it was really neat to see Little Bear, Boone and Tommy (Steve Coogan) the medic brought to life on the screen. It was pretty cool to see the Star Wars, Jurrasic Park, G.I Joe, and Robo-Cop reference. The movie is pretty close to the book, minus little changes such as the toy shop. I laugh at the kid that loves JFK. While the movie isn't that bad, it's not going to hurt the kids watching it. I like it when I was a kid and still kinda do.

I liked it but it doesn't have the stuff to make it to my higher favoritism of movies. Frank Oz is imaginative, but I have to say that this film to me is not so Frank Oz, and movies that are adapted from books are quite impressive, but I can only say I was slightly impressed. For one thing, the cast is inadequate, I never heard of David Keith and Litefoot.This story follows Omri, an extremely childish youngster who, for his birthday, receives a MAGICAL (ooh!) cupboard. The Cupboard lacks its key so Omri's mother (actress Lindsay Crouse, never heard of her), gives him her collection of keys, and guess what&#x85;? He finds the certain key on his second try! That part always took me aback. He puts in an antique Iroquois figure in the cupboard, and later in the morning he opens it to find the figure alive as a small Iroquois man. The pair has many tedious adventures, some including an idiotic rat ball and a down-right scruffy cowboy who was a toy figure too.

There is no key to lock the cupboard, but mother Lindsay Crouse lets young Mr. Scardino try some stray keys from her collection. Happily, it turns out that Scardino's great-grandmother gifted a key to his mother, which perfectly fits the cupboard. Scardino locks up a Native American Indian toy figure, a antique gift from best friend Rishi Bhat (as Patrick), overnight. When he wakes up, Scardino discovers that Iroquois Litefoot (as Little Bear) has come to life, in miniature form, from the year 1761.The simple but effective special effects used throughout The Indian in the Cupboard have, surprisingly, made this film seem more natural looking than the special effects extravaganzas which blew it out of the theaters, back in the 1990s. Michael Lantieri, Eric Brevig, director Frank Oz, and their team make Scardino's little friends look very real. The story is based on a charming series of books by Lynne Reid Banks; the several sequels blunt the impact of the final door closing on the magical years of childhood, but the additional stories have no impact on this charming children's story. Grown-ups and some kids should see subtleties.******* The Indian in the Cupboard (7/14/95) Frank Oz ~ Hal Scardino, Litefoot, Rishi Bhat, David Keith "},{"Title":"Good movie, but not true to book","Date":"17 October 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" I loved the film, really I did, but its just not true to the book. People who want to see a movie based more on the book, will be somewhat disappointed. Not true to the book are both setting and character appearance- England (London I believe) has been transformed to NYC. What's wrong with London? The English environment worked for Harry Potter, why couln't it have worked for this film. Omri and Patrick, both Caucasian in the book, have been also transformed so Patrick is now Indian (from India) a nice kind of play on words (he's Indian and Little Bear is an 'Indian') ... But taking the story out of its context of early 1990's England, changes things. Plot changes- as the entire confrontation with the store owner who believes that Omri is stealing figures has been changed into Patrick and Omri fighting in school. While things like this might make the story more 'Americanized' in hopes to make the movie more appreciable to American viewers, I missed the accents, sights and sounds of what I hoped would be England. I longed for the scene in the toy shop, and the one where the teacher sees Little Bear move. Changing the toy shop scenes for Omri stealing the figures from school also ruined what could be a good scene- of Little Bear standing on the toy shop shelf, looking at the figures. Also, the end of the movie was IMVHO not good. Killing off any change for sequels. Perhaps the author wanted it this way. In any case, killing off any hope for sequels pushed this down a few notches for me. Its a good movie, but its just not like the book, other than the skeleton of the plot.

(Frank Oz) used to be the creative comic voice at the immortal (Muppet Show) and a good comedian occasionally as well, so what in god's name had happened ??? I've never felt of such suppressed provocation while watching a movie before; it's like bad flu, being imprisoned, or forced to be with the silliest creatures at all. On the poster, you'll read (An Adventure Comes to Life), well, apparently it dies again so fast. I think it's too gloomy and deadly slow (believe me it's one of the slowest) to be meant for children or else. Not to mention the scarily tasteless mood all over it. I still remember how the leaden sense of it bothered me for the whole day after watching.

It might be useful only to punish your kids if they did something really wicked, however on second though that could be a little bit sadistic !

Although it lacks originality, its story had potential, but somehow the result falls short. Arguably the most crucial weakness is that it stretches credibility to the limit; the basic premise of toys coming to life is easy enough to accept, but the suggestion that the toys have their own, secret, private lives even when they are seemingly soulless pieces of plastic, is really hard to swallow. Moreover, the film would me more fun if it allowed its characters to explore the possibilities and activities of the real world, but they seem to suffer from melancholia and boredom and they just want to go back. The special effects are excellent, and the film does have a couple of inventive moments, but too much moralizing and plodding pacing make it seem longer than it is. 5/10 would be a fair rating, I think.

Litefoot plays a wonderful role as the Indian brought to life, but I also suspect he may have had a little hand in the production guiding and eliminating several Native American stereotypes from the production. I do admit being quite a bit intrigued by the power of the cupboard and/or key as by some of the toys brought to life seem to actually hold the consciousnesses of actual individuals returned to life. If so, then the cupboard is merely a time machine of sorts, but there is a very cute, albeit brief scene where Omri brings to life a few of his action figures and discovers how dangerous they are with their phony weapons transformed into their real life equivalents. Among which is a dinosaur possibly from his Jurassic Park collection. He could have kept the creature alive and sold it for a million at his local Natural History Museum. He also doesn't have any comic book superheroes to bring to life; what a chance he missed ! I can only wonder if a barbie doll would have come out looking like Anna Nicole Smith !

For one thing, the cast is inadequate, I never heard of David Keith and Litefoot (David Coogan, however, was in Around the World in 80 Days).This story follows Omri, an extremely childish youngster who, for his birthday, receives a MAGICAL (ooh!) cupboard. The Cupboard lacks its key so Omri's mother (actress Lindsay Crouse, never heard of her), gives him her collection of keys, and guess what&#133;? He finds the certain key on his second try! That part always took me aback. He puts in an antique Iroquois figure in the cupboard, and later in the morning he opens it to find the figure alive as a small Iroquois man.

I think my first viewing of The Indian in the Cupboard was on the big screen, and then I saw it at school twice at two different times within the next few years. So, I saw this film twice during childhood, and a third time in my early adolescent years. Just yesterday, I rented it so I could see it again for the first time in nine years. By this time, I had seen its rating and number of votes here, so I could tell that it wasn't highly regarded as a family classic. For that reason, I did not have high expectations, and basically, this PG-rated family movie turned out to be a mixed blessing, which was probably the best I could hope for.When a young boy named Omri celebrates his ninth birthday, one of the presents he gets is a cupboard from his older brother, and another is a little plastic Indian figure from his friend. With both of these presents, he is in for a surprise. After placing the plastic figure in the cupboard, locking it up, and then opening it again, he sees that the figure, still the same size, has come to life! He soon learns that this is what happens when one places a figure in there, locks the door, and opens it again! That plastic figure has been replaced by a real 18th century Iroquois Indian named Little Bear, interrupted from his life and brought to Omri's room, where he is the size of an action figure! He agrees to stay for a while, but during his stay, he and the young modern-day boy are headed for adventure and conflict, and their cultural differences turn out to be one of their problems.One criticism of this movie I agree with is the acting, especially Hal Scardino's acting in the lead role of Omri. He wasn't the greatest child actor to ever make it to the silver screen, that's for sure. Another severe flaw in the film is sometimes the musical score. It tends to be pretty sappy, and really seems unreasonable at times, such as the music in the scene where Omri first sees Little Bear alive in the cupboard. More still, there's some very poor dialogue, and there also may be some humour here, but that also usually fails, with the likes of Boo-hoo Boone, a goofy cowboy who also comes from the cupboard. Now, not everything about this film is bad. Little Bear is a likable character, even if Litefoot doesn't do the greatest job playing him. I can't say I was completely bored throughout the entire film, as there were parts that intrigued me to a certain degree, but this did not hide the blatant flaws.I vaguely remember reading the book back in the late 90's, but can't remember it too well, so I don't know how it compares. However, it does seem to be more popular than this adaptation. This movie is one of those which was never one of my favourites as a kid, and I'm not sure exactly what I thought of it at the time, but I guess I liked it somewhat. During my last viewing, much later than the rest of them, I could definitely see more flaws in it than I used to (I don't think I used to see any real flaws in it at all). This 1995 adaptation of The Indian in the Cupboard does have a few redeeming features, but I'm sure they could have tried harder to make it really good family entertainment, and if only they had avoided the negative things I've pointed out, there would have been a good chance that they could have made it happen.

This is a messed up and demented dog that puts two of the most annoying children together (Hal Scardino and Rishi Bhat) to play God in a strange magical world where plastic toys are put into an old cupboard and then turned into real people that remain the size they were as toys. The titled character (Litefoot) and an Old West cowboy (David Keith) are innocent toys that become victims to the two children who do not understand the concept of giving something life. Instead they unwittingly taunt, tease and be-little (no pun intended) two people that may be toys, but actually end up having real thoughts, feelings, loves and complexities when an old skeleton key is turned to open the cupboard. Many have been fooled by this thing, saying it is good wholesome entertainment for children. This is a control film; the only thing ever gotten from Melissa Mathison's terrible novel is the element of control. Two youngsters are in total control and the toys are basically sinners (or maybe not) in the hands of angry gods. Director Frank Oz does nothing to endear the picture and it amazes me that a worldwide talent search would only yield Scardino and Bhat (both should stay in school instead of working in films). A movie that I think has no merit and less business even existing. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).  "}]
