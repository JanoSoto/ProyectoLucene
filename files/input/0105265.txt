Serene","Date":"21 October 2005","Score":"88 out of 121 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" A stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place!! Be it, firecrackers going off, witnessing a robbery, a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it's path, or, for that matter, any other spectacular occurrence !! In the case of the Maclean Family, however, reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives..Montana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble...The Maclean family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly. His wife was God fearing, and dutiful. The two boys were, well...BOYS!!.. What else can you say?...Brad Pitt starred in this film before he was really THE!! Brad Pitt, and his acting performance in this film was, to say the least, remarkable!!!.. His brother, Norman, was the cerebral type, he was touched by emotions that were genuine, and motivated by a set of values that Missoula, Montana concurred with!! Paul (Brad Pitt) was a misfit from the offset, and lived on the edge...You would think that Montana in the 1920's had no such thing, yet somehow, gambling, drinking, and violent confrontations, were as much a part of Paul, as was his fly fishing rod!! Fly fishing!! Did I say that? Parenthetically, this was the core of this movie's theme!! The recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the Maclean brothers, and to a lesser degree, the father!! I would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable, and the cinematography went beyond sensational.. Put it this way, anyone who sees this film will want to live in Montana.. Breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the Maclean brothers had for life...Seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish..The Maclean brothers lived life to the fullest, and for better or worse, the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men!!...Robert Redford directs this film, and tells the story of the Maclean's through the perspective of the older brother, Norman...Norman gets offered a position at the University of Chicago at age 26, and marries the woman he will always be in love with...What this film also points out, is that the younger brother, Paul, has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!! The seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence, and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the Maclean family!! As most human shortcomings go, the Maclean family made light of turbulent waters, (literally) and thus, established unity as a family, by putting necessary blinders on!!!The end of the movie River Runs Through It presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother.. For Norman Maclean, stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years!! Such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away! The fond memories of his brother, his wife, his mother, and his father, must now be viewed philosophically!! For Norman, his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook, and precarious resolve! Something as simple as the statement This was your life, and that is how you lived it is a somber recollection of the joy, the sorrow, the regrets, and the love, he gave, as well as was the recipient of!! Best put in the last sermon he heard his father give, his father said We can completely love someone without completely understanding them.. Whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not, it happened nonetheless! Norman Maclean must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings! Norman Maclean has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life!! The murky waters of Montana's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth!! Without question, the very prolific statement of what seems complicated is really very simple purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie...More simply put...The people and places which were important in Norman's life, are now only a bittersweet memory....merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of Montana's beautiful streams and rivers...To which, for the entire Maclean family, all things merge into one and a river runs through it "},{"Title":"This movie is very dear to my own Heart!

My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford &#145;s movies  and we have watched A River runs through it many times.  Redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to A River Runs Through It, Methodists are Baptists who can read,  a line which by the way is not in the short story,  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are well-read Baptists!I have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven)  is the  perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say Grace! and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!Redford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities.  Redford shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it.

This is as much of a fishing movie as Hoosiers is about basketball, or Field of Dreams is about baseball.The story is elegant, the narrative beautiful, the characters deftly drawn. The relationship between the father and two sons is really interesting, and I love the interplay between them.  There is great sadness, and also great humour.  While nostalgic, I don't think the film ever becomes maudlin, and by the time the film draws to its inevitable close, I feel the same sense of loss and regret every time.This movie does what films are supposed to do - touch one's heart and mind.The closing lines, taken from a short story by McLean, are as haunting as they are beautifulBut when I am alone in the half light of the canyon all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories. And the sounds of the Big Black Foot River and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.

It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia, Norman Maclean and his brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WW1 Montana be a showcase for the American family, at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has Maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens, Norman is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course his own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness, against time's current and back to when he was a boy. He and his younger brother Paul were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad. Given the choice, little Paul would be the boxer, since he's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesn't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks, fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do, all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when Norm returns from his six years at Dartmouth, things are very different. Paul is at the top of his game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. Norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life, even as his father grills him about what he intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops, God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life. Father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. Listen, their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. Maclean's family is unraveling? Paul is true perfection as he fishes the river, but he's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while his family doesn't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed. Mom, Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm. But the junior brother is losing his grip. Norman starts getting his life on track, finding love and career, but Paul continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother, Father, Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help, but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature, yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions Norman will ponder his entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him, yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an Oscar. Director Robert Redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting, and it works well. But do go back and read the book, too. You'll see Norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.

In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's elegant ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again. "},{"Title":"The 'It' of the title can be replaced by so many things. A place, a community or life itself.","Date":"21 August 2004","Score":"40 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  One of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive Brown Trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them.When we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in.This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly carried out the ritual. For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. You can't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to attune yourself to the place you are in, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and, depending on your skill level, you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike. The 'Art of Fly-fishing' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists.The title for the film could not be more aptly chosen, for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons. This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in Montana, by the the Blackfoot river, where the film is played out. It has the capacity to draw you in, to enthrall you, to capture you, as the history of the family, community and period is unfolded. The Story told is not just a family history, but a history of Life.

Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspirational books; He states You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic. Nor do I think God had banal television programs, media hype, worthless purchases, and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe... I hadn't seen A river runs through it in a couple of years, but after pondering Kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye. I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book (a must read). I have always been frustrated in Southern California but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society. The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God's creations. A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has driven me to move to Montana. I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape, go fly-fishing with me, ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside. A place where you seldom worry about crime. I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls, rude snarling people in their Mercedez Bens, miles of vehicles on congested freeways, gangs, racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption, and everyone skeptical of each others intentions.Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. There is a lot of deep thinking in this film. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. It takes a compassionate, intelligent, and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning. If you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue, tone, light, colour, scenery, camera angles/movement, etc. Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks The Fast and the Furious is the greatest film. Granted it was entertaining but shallow.The bottom line This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses. Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together.

Their father is a Presbyterian minister, and the two sons, Paul and Norman, take very different paths in life. Norman, dubbed the preacher by his buddies, is a serious, steady, man- he marries and becomes an English professor. Paul, on the other hand, feels the need to rebel against his stern Presbyterian upbringing. He's a risk taker, and he likes to have a good time. As the story unfolds, he dives deeper into drinking and gambling.One of the main themes in the movie is fly fishing, which is brought up again and again. As Norman says in narration, In my family, there is no clear division between religion and fly fishing. The boys learn the skill from their father, and it remains one of the things that binds the men together throughout their lives. Paul makes it an art form, fishing with so much grace that his brother is awed. Many metaphors for life are shown through their family fishing trips.Just as Norman's life is taking shape- he gets a job offer from the University of Chicago and proposes to his girlfriend- Paul finally spirals out of control, which was admittedly a long time coming. Despite Paul's tumultuous life and violent end, his father and brother hold a deep and abiding love for him. At the end of the movie, the Rev. Maclean gives one of his final sermons, and his message brings back memories of Paul, who is never far from the family's thoughts. We can love completely, without complete understanding. That simple realization sums up Paul's relationship with his family perfectly.This movie affected me very deeply. Maybe it's because I too am a Scottish Presbyterian, maybe because I also lost a loved one to drinking, or maybe just because it is such a powerful story, and it is told so beautifully. Tom Skerritt, Craig Sheffer, and Brad Pitt all deliver wonderful performances in a movie that will continue to touch you long after the credits run. I know this story will forever be with me.Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it...I am haunted by waters.

Craig Sheffer/Norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how Jess's brother turned out. There are various instances where Brad Pitt and his lives run in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there so Craig Sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.

Craig Sheffer plays the young MacLean and his brother Paul is played by Brad Pitt. The parents are played by Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn.With some introductory material showing the characters as children and how their personalities developed, most of the film is concentrated on young Norman MacLean's first summer back in Missoula, Montana with the family after six years at the University Of Chicago. While Sheffer has been studying for his degrees, Pitt has taken a job as a reporter on a local paper. Pitt had a reckless streak as a youngster and its become more pronounced as a young man. He's taken with some reckless habits, this was in fact the Roaring Twenties and Pitt is quite the child of that era. The only thing that father and both sons have in common is the love that Skerritt instilled in his sons for dry fly fishing. It's in those scenes that the family comes together.Robert Redford got a real family feeling for the players portraying the MacLean family. Redford who grew up in the west also has a real feel for the environment. No accident that A River Runs Through It won an Oscar for Best Cinematography. It was also nominated for Best Musical Scoring and Best Adapted Screenplay from another medium.A River Runs Through It was a big career boost for Brad Pitt. For a guy who admittedly has some outstanding looks which no doubt first got people's attention, Brad Pitt has shown an astonishing range of character development on the screen. Paul MacLean is as different from Heinrich Harrer, from Joe Black and a whole lot of others. In his 20 or so years of stardom, go down the list of roles and they range the gamut of the human experience.And if you're not a particular Brad Pitt fan, you'll enjoy A River Runs Through It for the great nature cinematography that is the heart of this film.

Nothing emerged and the titles rolled. Brad Pitt, who is arguably one of the world's finest actors, isn't even given the chance to pull this out. His character is really never shown in the grasp of his addictions and struggling with them, etc...

Supposedly as the voice of one of the main characters, who actually has his OWN voice, which is obviously a different voice than the narrator, which is supposed to be him, but it's obviously Redford. Confused yet? Me too. Redford never struck me as arrogant until this movie... Narrating was a bad choice.And the fishing = religion, river = life, world = God theme was a real eyeroller.

While the relationships among the three men are well developed, there is little here that is interesting. There is really no plot to speak of, and the deliberate pace makes it drag.

Here let's just say that in A River Runs Through It, Redford shows us different side to his artistic traits the visual storyteller. Here he's telling the story not through words, but through creating images that will keep you entertained, draw to tears and most of all to please his audience and for that I say hats off to you, Mr. Redford. You are a true Hollywood icon!The centrepiece of the story centres on the sport of fishing. The Mclean brothers Norman (Craig Sheffer of One Tree Hill fame) and Paul (Brad Pitt) frequently go fishing in the rich settings of 1920's Montana. Smart and resourceful are the two brothers, thanks mainly from the house-schooling from their father, whose the town preacher (Tom Skerritt). Through the years, they've learnt a lot about the sport of fishing and the teachings of the Bible. Norman and Paul don't strike you as brothers just tolerating each other, but they have a strong bond between them almost as if they are best friends. As they got older, the brothers decide to embark on separate journeys. Norman leaves his humble Montana home to enrol in college and becomes an English professor and eventually returns home and has a love interest in a girl named Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd). Paul doesn't have it as easy as Norman. Paul suffers from the fate of hard times as he takes up gambling which eventually becomes a full-blown addiction. This addiction becomes so bad that he's like caught in a web that's in a tight lock making it impossible to escape and before you know it leads to his downward spiral. A lot of praise came out at the time about how this movie will be remembered by movie fans for many years to come. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Redford's most memorable directed films will probably be a tie between Quiz Show or The Legend of Bagger Vance which were both very wonderful movies. The acting overall is brilliant from Sheffer, Pitt and Skerritt that were both believable and very heart-warming. If you like to take a break from the action thrillers into something more calm and more serene, then this movie should please you greatly.

Although nominally set in rural Montana in the early 20th century, in fact the film goes back much further. The opening and closing passages of the memoir, quoted in voice-over in the film, make clear that director Robert Redford, like Maclean, is dealing with Adam's fall from grace, the quite different ways in which two sons of a stern Presbyterian preacher seek redemption -- one by cleaving to the teachings and expectations of his father, the other by rejecting convention and striking out on his own -- and the impossibility of knowing whether their different fates were predestined or might somehow have been avoided. This is not the usual stuff of cinema, which normally depends on standard plot devices to push the action forward -- if truth be told, Maclean's poetic and sometimes funny narrative probably succeeds better on its own terms -- but Redford makes a few small changes, takes lots of chances, and comes very close to duplicating Maclean's substance and tone. The acting is first-rate, the cinematography won awards, and the music should have. The only flaw, in my view, is that the ending of the film comes as a surprise, and thus lacks the tragic inevitability of the memoir, but don't let that stop you from seeing it. Nine stars.

The kids playing the younger Macleans were quite an asset; I did recognize Joseph Gordon-Levitt in an impressive debut (though not his first). As I was watching, I thought well, it looks all nice, but what's happening? I was unsure about the film's focus. The film is often slow and confusing, even if you are familiar with the Norman MacLean story; and, this is a somewhat alternate version/vision of the original written work.And, I realized what I was watching. It happened twenty minutes (or so) after the kids grew up - this is the story of Norman Maclean's remembrances&#133; the touching stones of his life. They may not be the things you'd believe an old man remembers; but, by the end of the film, you know. You'll understand the focus on his brother, with that magical quality that just slipped away&#133; Perhaps, there was no perfection there; but, you'll know why Norman sees it. You'll know why that memory of the perfect fly fisherman is there.Just a few other thoughts At the risk of over-analyzing, I felt the characters of Norman, Paul, their father, and Redford merging into ONE character at the end of the film; I wonder if Redford intended it that way? His direction, narration, and lead performances seemed blend together&#133; Directing, Preaching, Fishing, the River - it all runs together; and, we're all water.

I thought It is a movie about fishing and family relationship. Is it worthy us to watch? With the movie going on, I tried to focus my mind on it, but I almost failed in the first half part because of its boring. Little by little, I went deep into it, although it is hard to be appreciated immediately. I had kept thinking and studying on it for a long time, now I have found something, something about Paul . The story took place in a little town. Two brothers, Norman and Paul, grow up with their father's lessons that had to do with religion, and the lessons of fly-fishing. In this movie fly-fishing represents life. The older brother, Norman, followed the prescribed order of his father's lessons. He went to college. After six years he returned and fell in love with a nice girl named Jessie, finally he was invited to teach in Chicago. On the contrary, the younger brother, Paul, a stubborn boy, had become a reporter and was known as the fishing reporter. It seemed he almost had his own nice life, but his drinking and gambling destroyed himself. Paul dead in the jail just before Norman left the town. The story implies people's life style by the fly-fishing. People can choose a prescribed order life or an unconventional way. Compared with Norman's successful life, it seemed that Paul had a loser's life by choosing a special life style, and his unique fly-fishing method is the refection. From another point of view, Paul got a chance to try his life style, although his way was hard at that time.

Montana serves as the backdrop as the story is one of a family's interaction as brothers grow up over years and the different paths and personalities each develop despite identical background and upbringing.  I have heard it referred to as a guy version of a Chick flick for it deals with the thoughts and emotions of men as they grow up.  The small town setting of the movie serves to simplify the situation and make it easier to focus on the story.

Based on the novel by Norman Maclean, A River Runs Through It propels us through a generation of life in a place that's mere scenery makes your jaw drop. It is not a perfect world, but it is one that has more principles and ideals than the one most of us live in. It is a world where the concept of entertainment does not rely on television or radio, but on fly-fishing. And it is one you will want to experience over and over by watching A River Runs Through It again and again. Although the film spans two hours, with not an action scene in sight (unless you consider the brief brawl between the Maclean brothers in the kitchen an action scene), Redford manages once again to keep the audience interested, relying more on choreography and character development to make the movie good. Another thing I appreciated about this movie is the fact that the Maclean brothers have a set of dynamics that has never previously been displayed; they do not envy each other's lives (they might, but it is never really developed), they do not hate each other, they simply followed two different paths and experienced the world in two different ways. The adapted script (which was nominated for an Academy Award) was mostly free of cliches, and some of the dialogue is really well-written. In a world of horror and slasher films that feel they have to gratuitously display gore and guts to make them entertaining, A River Runs Through It is a heartfelt breath of fresh air, and a great film for everyone.Overall rating 9/10  "},{"Title":"Redford's best movie as director","Date":"30 April 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Yes, the movie is different from the book, and yes, many events are captured through reaction to them rather than action, yet these are hardly flaws.

Brad Pitt delivers yet another great performance as the younger and wilder son Paul, and the unappealing looking Craig Sheffer stars as Paul's older brother Norman, from whose point of view the entire film is told.The early 20th century is beautifully and accurately presented, and there is even a reference to former President Calvin Coolidge. When Paul grows up, he becomes a reporter, and gets an interview with the President as he is fly fishing in Montana, the state where the film takes place. Not only is this historically accurate as far as the time period, but we also all remember Calvin Coolidge as the president who seemed to be more interested in fishing than working in the White House. Maybe he had the same opinion that George W. Bush has, that `presidenting is hard.' At any rate, it was never a secret that Coolidge wanted to be the `least president possible.'A River Runs Through It is a very thorough and meaningful drama that presents a long period of time in a thoughtful and clear way. The film as a whole is structured in a way that is very similar to the way that Saving Private Ryan is structured, by being told from the point of view of one of the characters when he is a very old man. The theme of the whole film can be summarized in one of Norman's lines near the end of the film &#150; `Life is not a work of art.' The film suggests that even though life is not perfect, even in the most beautiful surroundings, you can, and should, find something that makes you happy and do that as much as possible. For the Maclean family, that activity was fishing, and Norman continues that activity until he is an old man. It's true that the end of the film may have gotten a little too philosophical and ended up sounding a little bit like gibberish (such as the closing line, `I am haunted by waters.'), but the film as a whole is both entertaining and heartwarming. Everyone involved delivered excellent performances that were appropriate for the subject matter, and the character development was intelligent and thorough.

His preoccupation with nature (see The Horse Whisperer), and the relation people should share together bring us such moving, sensible and perceptive films that must be thoroughly appreciated and carefully analysed to bring out their true meanings which of course constiture their greatness. Thus, I fully recommend A river runs through it to anyone with an open mind and anyone who's sick and tired of watching Hollywood blockbusters with not even an ounce of truth or heart.

I had read in a magazine that Robert Redford was directing a movie based on a book about a family who enjoyed fly-fishing in Montana.  A virtually unknown actor (except for fans of Thelma and Louise) named Brad Pitt would have one of the principal roles, and it was certain to be a worthwhile venture. Fortunately, I read the book by Norman Maclean first.  I read it on a rainy summer afternoon, and was stunned by it, partially because I could relate to it, and also because of the predictable, yet shocking conclusion. After reading the book, I was even more impressed by Pitt (Paul Maclean), Craig Sheffer (Norman Maclean), and Tom Skerritt (Reverend Maclean).  If nothing else, I felt that they, as well as the entire cast at least remained true to book's portrayal of character traits. From the first scenes of the movie with Redford's voice narrating the past of this little Montana town inhabited by the Maclean's, one has the feeling that although one of the principal vehicles of Maclean telling the story is fly fishing, there is going to be much more to the story.  As a family, Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Maclean) and Skerritt do a more than admirable job portraying turn of the century parents trying to battle even a young Paul, and teach a young Norman to be a good big brother. As the years go by, Norman and Paul go their separate ways, but not before they have an adventure in the river, and Paul takes responsibility for it.  Similar scenes where Paul takes the fall for Norman are throughout the movie.  Perhaps the most dramatic scenes occur with Norman trying to help pull Paul away from his drinking and gambling, which turns out to be futile, and one can sense this throughout, both by the narrator's comments and the action of the movie. Besides the acting and directing, the award winning cimematography was outstanding (Philippe Rousselot).  It gave me the feeling more than once that I was in the Big Blackfoot River with the Maclean's.  The music (Elmer Bernstein, Mark Isham) was also appropriate and even helped the story in the many dramatic moments. To be honest, the plot-line concerning Jessie (Emily Loyd) and Norman was somewhat tedious, even though this is based on true life.  Funny, but also kind of unnecessary, was the plot that concerned Neal (Stephen Shellen) as Jessie's irrascable brother.  Redford almost tried to portray him as Paul's foil, but at least Paul had some admirable traits. Overall, I will remember this movie with Norman  trying to convince Paul to come with him and Jesse to Chicago, and Paul's response Oh, I'll never leave Montana, brother. It was prophetic for many reasons.  And few lines are as chilling as the narrator's I'm haunted by waters. Metaphorically, most of us are, or will be.

Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and this was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together. The movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart, and I was weepy for several days after seeing the movie. Sometimes love isn't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- I was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, But when I am alone in the half light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul, and memories. And the sounds of the Big Black Foot River, and a four count rhythm, and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters. These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie (by Robert Redford who is narrating as Norman Maclean), are basically scripture, in my opinion. Any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography. It was beautiful!

All of page one's commentators wrote eloquently - as almost so as the dialog is in this movie. This just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about, but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script. Maybe Robert Redford did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie, so that the beauty of the story would not get lost.I, too, attended church when I was very young and into my late teens. The church's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the Rev. Maclean did in his church. That, in itself, is a totally different picture that is portrayed of Southern Baptist churches - no holy-rollering in my church. It was a big church, with many different programs to keep its congregation busy - the most inspiring perhaps was the music-department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems. Too, the Sunday evening-congregation was almost entirely younger people. Are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on Sunday night? How I wish it still was ! Watching A River Runs through It is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life. As has already been so beautifully written, the sermon for this movie is the open-space beauties of Montana - yet, aren't there also missile-silos there, too? Fly-fishing or any other activity which draws family-members closer together for a happy life - and deep understanding of one another - becomes a blessing. Although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then, too, the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart, if you let it. Speakeasies and prostitutes are counter-balanced by the simple gatherings of old-fashioned, community picnics as this movie contains - in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to Disney Land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together. There is noting wrong with that, but as River demonstrates, some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer. This is the third film I've seen in which Tom Skeritt (?) plays a father, all different styles and brilliantly acted.Brad Pitt, mostly an undiscovered talent except for Thelma and Louise and Meet Joe Black, and all of the cast-members deserved many awards. Little stories superbly told will get 10-of-10 from me over any movie with violence, foul language, ugliness and action. I am thinking particularly of Crash and most of Arnold's movies. What a savior for peace this movie is.

Okay, I'm exaggerating, but to a city-bound Scot (and hey, I know my country has a countryside at least the equal of the Montana shown here), I failed to really connect with the story or the characters.Perhaps I watched too many TV episodes of The Waltons or The Mississippi in my formative years, but found that the family portrait conveyed here and the ups and downs of the two brothers was a little too sentimental, second-hand and, to be honest undramatic, to really engage me.It's entertaining in its undemonstrative way and acted well enough, especially Tom Skerret and Brenda Blethyn as the God-fearing parents but until someone finds a way to make fishing exciting to watch, a film like this which celebrates the art of angling to the extent that this one does, will never quite hit the mark for me.

Redford keeps casting the lines but rarely gets a good bite. It is in the casting of the lines where this movie exists. It's not particularly interested in having an exciting time catching fish.

A River Runs Through It a film directed by Robert Redford, based on the novella by Norman Maclean by the same name, stars Craig Sheffer as the lead Norman Maclean, and Brad Pitt as Norman's little brother Paul Maclean. The movie sticks fairly well to the story for a story of this kind, that doesn't many many cinematic opportunities. Although a few details are sacrificed, it does not take away from the originality of the story. It also adds some of it's own, new touches, that help make the movie more memorable. The adaptation of the film, while not being completely accrete, is able to stay true to the story if that makes any sense. This is why the film A River Runs Through It while not sticking completely to each event of the book the of the same name by Norman Maclean, is able to stay true to the overall story and messages that are portrayed in the book. While adding a little touch of cinema so that the average masses of movie goers won't get to bored. By the time the credits role. The characters in this film, are just the right amount of book adaptation, and the it would already take a very intriguing actor to play the free spirited Paul, but seeing Brad Pitt in the role, just makes it even more interesting. Craig Sheffer, while not p ache viewing such stardom as Brad Pitt, still is able to play his role in the movie very effectively. These two leads, realistically, couldn't have been cast any better. Of course there are other side characters that weren't as perfectly cast. Norm and Paul's father didn't particularly fit in the role. Almost everyone who read the book probably imagined him as more of a big rugged guy, even if her was a preacher, that is how the book portrayed him. Not to mention Paul's beautiful Native American girlfriend p, who was neither beautiful, or Native American. But this is just nitpicking, since no film can have a perfect cast, and the two brothers are enough to keep this movie afloat nicely.The theme is something that movies can get very wrong, very easily, in book to movie. adaptations. Especially when dealing with a theme such as the one in this book, which is confusing to the most advanced reader. The film makers were treading on thin ice, when they took up this part of the story. But, to their credit, they don't just portray the theme accurately, they make it easier to understand. With a story such as this one, with such a narrative and underlying meaning in it's characters. The theme is not just being waved right in your face, and screaming that it's the theme. Your have to search for it, and even then it's very hard to understand. It one of those themes where you read the whole book, and came find all the little details, and put them all together, and your starting at complete nonsense. The movie decides to uncork the nonsense for you, while still not shoving it in your face, so obnoxiously, as films tend to do with their themes. The actors also certainly know what their young to portray their theme. With their clear use of meaning in their lines, and just how subtlety the can lay on the emotion. It's clear the message in A River Runs Though It isn't one that's going away any time soon. So on the whole, even if the movie did have a few things that seem to crop up in movies are less than appetizing, (seeing a girl from acrossed to room at a party, and falling in love with her, the strict parent, the reckless decision as youth, that could have killed them, but they turn out okay anyway). However the movie was a successful adaption of the book it is named after. It's characters are for the most part, well adapted, and it's theme is clear. Little more can be asked of a movie adaptation of a book. This movie is one that is sure to please, fans of the classic short story, and true movie lovers a like. Although if your a person who only likes big studio movies, who favors big explosions, among other unrealistically big things on the screen at all times, I'd leave this one out of your collection.

In the movie A River Runs Through It, based on the Novella by Norman Maclean, two boys are born and raised in Montana by their Minister father while they are molded by religious ways and specific techniques of fly fishing. Norman, being the oldest, is also the narrator of this tale of simple living in Montana. He is very successful, however, Paul, the youngest brother gets himself into a good amount of trouble. Later we learn how and where Paul's successes shine through. A River Runs Through It is a beautiful film about family, simplicity, life lessons and values that takes the viewer out of their busy day and back down to the core of things. The novella was beautifully and very successfully adapted, expressing the emotions of the boys who struggle to express them themselves. The setting for the movie is very scenic and just as described in the beautifully descriptive novella. Although the life is simple, the brother's encounters and internal struggles are much more complex then they initially appear. The emotionless black and white characters are brought to beautiful visualization of human life and love in this visually and emotionally comforting film about life lessons. The film touches on a new level then the book could ever fathom and more, yet it still includes all the aspects the book had. Brad Pitt as Paul and Craig Sheffer as Norm were perfectly casted. Brad perfectly exemplified the cute and small persona, along with the heart and drive of a fighter that Paul had. Brad is very charming and appears perfect on the outside, but is much more complex and conflicted on the inside. Craig seems rough and tough, but with Norms personality, he the loving one, and is more the type that is caring and supportive of the important people in his life. Both boys adapted to perfectly fit the era and the setting. If one didn't know they were actors, one would say that they truly believed they were born and raised in Montana. These two strangers come together as actors in the film to have a bond that is not shown in affection; but a bond that is strong enough to be visible by the pure sense of feeling, devotion and family ties. The theme of the film is subtle throughout, but shines through if one really looks past the different things that these small town boys get themselves into. Even though the theme of the film could be over looked, the simplicity helps by putting more emphases on the meaning of the experiences, then the experiences them selves. The main symbol in this book is no secret fly fishing. It can be looked at as a metaphor for a lot of different little things. But in general, fly fishing is used as a metaphor for life. It is the boys life, so it is used as kind of a guide line for everything that they learn, and all of the decisions they have to make. The dedication, the reach for perfection, the focus, the competition, the friendship, the technique. Everything about how these boys use fly fishing, is also mirrored in their every day lives. A River Runs Through It really reminded me how much family matters. In the ending lines when the Eventually all things merge into one, and a river runs through it line is spoken, that's when it really dawned upon me as a viewer. The viewer realizes the depth and love and meaning that was presented in the insightful minds eye of the film, aside from beautiful scenery, there is much much more in a human life, no matter how simple it may appear.

Sticking closely enough to the source novel, the film doesn't seem to sacrifice much from the novel for a more entertaining film. Instead, being able to see in the film what the novel vaguely describes helps much in getting everything out of the story. It's clear the novel meant something for someone, as there weren't many times where the movie strayed from the book, only at a few points it adds new things to the story. The changes it does make generally aren't very important, in one such case, Norm having already known Jesse in the book is turned into a brief subplot where he meets and builds a relationship with her. It's not as in other films, where they take the name, and make an entirely unrelated story out of it. The film looks exactly how the book described. The setting of the story feels looks how it was described in the novel, feeling like that Montana the characters talked about. There isn't excessive special effects, everything for the most part looks natural, and convincing. It's not as if it's a film needed many effects, but it's nice to see how the film wasn't covered in unneeded effects just to make it look more interesting, at the expense of story, like other films.Perhaps the most important thing the movie has going for it is the acting. Starring Craig Scheffer as Norm, and Brad Pitt as his brother Paul, these actors portray the two biggest characters rather accurately. Along with Tom Skerritt as their reverend father, the actors look the part, and make convincing enough brothers. Together, they make the film more compelling, being able to pull off Norm's concerned, wiser personality, and Paul's tough guy personality pretty well.Overall, the film is well acted, fairly well paced, and good looking. It doesn't make us suffer through the long descriptions of fly fishing that the novel did, instead maintaining fly fishing's importance to the story without doing that. The most unusual thing about this film is that it's superior to the source novel. Any film accomplishing such a feat deserves much respect.

In this cause in the novel A river runs though it it is so true! The novel the River Runs Though it was written by Norman Maclean in 1976. The book takes place in the small town in Montana. Where flying fishing was almost as important than their fathers preaching. Where fly fishing in the book took over every thing that was explaining about the boys Paul and Norman. The story was about a preachers family that made up of two boys Paul and Norman and the book was based on their life and struggles. The most important thing that came out of reading the book was seeing the film that came out of the fictional book the River Runs through It. For the movie it brought the book a better understanding and a light to the end of a very boring tunnel of facts and talk about nature. The film the River Runs Though it was a shot of excitement to the novel the River Runs Though it by being able to catch and keep the audience all the way though the movie. In the film the RiverRuns though it the book came to life we were able to understand the really drama that was coming out of Paul and Norman. Aside from the novel in the movie were where able to focus and understand the certain major events in the story instead of getting lost in the setting in the book. For example when Paul had the accident with the rabbit it was hard to understand because it was in a section in the book were all Norman McLean was talking about was the setting and the fly fishing. To the people in your lit and film the book was made in too lots of confusion were we had to keep double checking with each other for the key events that happened in the novel because we keep on getting lost or bored of what we were reading. The film surprised everyone we all though that the movie was going to be as boring as the book but the film was fantastic and it cleared up all the confusion that the book brought to the surface. The adaption was an success and totally worth the money to make the movie . The movie was able to show us the story of the boys and make it more interesting than the book did.As the book was so boring the only good thing was that Norman Maclean made his Characters his number one thing and detailed these people to the exact point. In the film the characters where exactly like the book described and made them seem more real and believable. The cast in the River Runs Through it were casted appropriately. the character Paul was seen as a prodigy son with a very bad drinking and gamboling problem. Paul was also very built in both the book and the movie. Norman the main character was the better Planed and caring person and son.Norman was always taking care of Paul through out the whole story. Norman was the narrator of the story. Norman and Paul's father was both in the movie and the book a stern religious person. He taught this kids to respect the nature around them and the importance of fly fishing. All of the characters were casted greatly because it made the story easier to understand and more believable. The characters also made the book more interesting and the movie fantastic.The setting and location was appropriate in the film because they made the movie in Montana were the book took place. For example they used the setting to create emotion to the scene and make people more into what is happening. They also use the setting in the film to create a more interesting and beautiful background to the story. They also used the setting to show how important nature was in the film The River Runs Through It. Most importantly the director used the setting to help us understand the boys and what they loved the most in their lives and how much things can change in matter of a few days or months. The setting in the film was able to show us how beautiful the nature was but in the movie it did not over power the characters stories like it did in the novel. Unless you love reading about a lot of nature and fishing the book The River Runs Through It is not for you. The movie on the other hand can be more interesting to the people who do not like fly fishing because in the movie they focus on the story of the two boys instead of the scenery. In fact the movie is actually better than the book because people have said that the movie is easier to understand. So here is to Norman Maclean best movie sellers The River Runs Through It. "},{"Title":"Great film, through & through","Date":"1 October 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The film, A River Runs Through It, is a true story about two boys, Norman and Paul, who grow up in Missoula, Montana. Paul is rebellious of his father, Reverend Maclean, while the other, Norman, has his feet on the ground. The one thing they both have in common, and happen to love, is fly fishing. Norman ends up going away to college for six years without returning home, until that summer. This film is about his return home and his summer with Paul, as adults. This movie was adapted from Norman Maclean's book, A River Runs Through It. The film A River Runs Through It successfully adapted Norman Maclean's novel, A River Runs Through It by capturing the true beauty in the fly fishing, In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing (1, Maclean), and the emotional struggles that Paul and Norman were going through. Paul, with his drinking and gambling problem, and Norman, with his struggle between doing what he wants, or what is expected of him. Not to mention, their parent's emotional struggles, worrying about Paul and what kind of trouble he's going to get himself into.The setting in this movie is extremely important. Throughout the whole book you have pictures of Paul and Norm fly fishing, the River, Neal when he passes out in the sun, of all the fights and no other place than the Rocky Mountains in Montana could have captured what was really going on. It really puts you in the 19th century and you finally have a visual of the endless words, in his novel.Redford's cast is nothing short of perfection. Tom Skerritt is Rev. MacLean, whose methods of education include fly fishing and the Bible, putting them on the same shelf. Brenda Blythen, the mother, and her sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family who reflect the same problems all families encounter with growing teenage sons, and later on, young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are believable as brothers with their love of fly fishing and each other, they'll always be tied together. The relationships between men, father and sons, brother and brother, man and wife, is what really ties this story together, and Redford wouldn't have been able to capture their emotions and relationships if he had any other cast.If you didn't enjoy the book because of endless description and no dialogue, you really have to watch the movie. This needs to be filed under Saving the Novel section in movies. It tells the story better than the book and when it's over, you're sitting there in awe, wondering how something so boring, could be turned into something so captivating.

Although great acting by all other players in the flick, Tom Skerritt is the only other one who went on to do much of anything. I read once Robert Redford (who directed the film) was one of many actors/directors that asked Norman Maclean if he could direct a film based off his popular 1976 novel A River Runs Through It and Other Stories. Maclean agreed, and apparently was able to approve the final screenplay draft prior to his death and the movies release respectively. A River Runs Through It was another one of those coming of age films much like Stand by Me that I grew up on. It's outstanding and truthful depiction of Maclean's childhood by talented actors is what has kept it in my top ten favorite movies of all time! I was never good at fishing and conversations people had about it bored me, but this movie made it fascinating. How one can compare and make so many references about life and the passing of time by a few rocks and rushing water to this day baffles me.

But I can see why some audiences can find this movie to be boring, including myself. It's just not a entertaining or exciting movie. But what it does have is good morals and values with a bit of love to it and those elements works for a movie like this. Even if everything just seems to be a bit too darn generic when it comes to the portrayal of a Christian family. And doesn't seem to have a distinct goal or ambition. But a movie like this shows that even if your life isn't all that adventurous or out of the ordinary, it's still amazing and has beauty and heart to it. Norman Maclean(Craig Sheffer) is the older brother in the family and he is basically the narrator and the protagonist. But this movie is basically popular for having young Brad Pitt in it as the younger brother Paul Maclean. This is a soft prairie movie that takes place in the 1920's. And basically shows the two brothers go to church, work and go fishing and their affections. Like I said it isn't the most entertaining or exciting movie but it has heart and I will just leave it at that.7/10 "},{"Title":"Boring And Dull But Powerful And Compelling","Date":"29 December 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" A River Runs Through It is film directed by Robert Redford and it features Brad Pitt, Craig Sheffer, Tom Skerritt, Brenda Blethyn, and Emily Lloyd. It is a period drama based on Norman Maclean's semi- autobiographical novella of the same name.Set in and around the city of Missoula in western Montana, the story follows two sons of a Presbyterian minister&#x97;one studious and the other rebellious&#x97;as they come of age during the 1920s.The film tells the autobiographical story about two young men, Norman and Paul, growing up during 1920s Missoula, Montana with the guidance of their father, a Presbyterian minister. Their mornings are spent in school and religious study, while their afternoons are devoted to fly fishing in the nearby Blackfoot River. Norman goes to the east coast for college and lives there for six years, without returning home until then. In the meantime, Paul gets a job as a journalist and makes a name for himself back home. The movie is mainly about Norman's return home and his and Paul's summer together.As adults, Paul is a rebellious journalist and his brother, Norman, a serious, literate teacher. Norman matures and channels his rebellion through his writing while dating Jessie Burns, while his reckless brother Paul turns to gambling and liquor. The movie chronicles their intertwining and sometimes conflicting lives, emphasizing Norman's point of view, as they grow up in the shadow of their minister father. A great deal of the movie surrounds the men's love of fly fishing for trout in Montana's rivers, and their shared experiences through it while growing up.Robert Redford's lyrical direction sets the tone for this evocative adaptation of author Norman MacLean's memoir of his idyllic Montana youth.The story's message to the viewer is to realize that that most of the events in any life are accidental or arbitrary, especially the crucial ones, and we can exercise little conscious control over our destinies.That was the case between this moving and powerful movie of two brothers - Norman and Paul.Although it has a powerful message,it was boring and dull at some points.Nevertheless,if one wants a movie that is both tasteful coupled with powerful performances from its talented cast especially Pitt and Skeritt,then this one is a must-see.

"},{"Title":"A beautiful, picturesque, glorious film experience","Date":"6 April 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I've never been a monumental Robert Redford fan, but that being said, I truly think that A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is not only Redford's greatest accomplishment (in this case as a director), but also one of the top 10 films of the 90s. First, RIVER is a beautiful film to look at the glorious scenic view of skies, mountains, streams, valleys, roads of 1920s Missoula, Montana. It's like seeing a great book transferred flawlessly to the screen. It just seems to capture this time and place to absolute perfection.The film is about the MacLean brothers, Norman and Paul (played by Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt in fine performances). Norman and Paul have very different personalities and ambitions. Norman wants the simple family life like the one that he was raised under and aspires to be a college professor of English, while Paul is a wild hellion who wants to live everyday as if its his last. The boys were raised by a stern, stalwart minister (played by Tom Skerrit in a dignified performance) and a homely, dedicated mother (Brenda Blethyn in a quietly likable performance). Norman returns from college for the summer awaiting word of his job application to several universities as professor and the sibling rivalry between he and Paul is renewed. Paul stayed in Missoula to work for the local newspaper.While home, Norman falls in love with a local girl Jessie Burns (played by Emily Lloyd) and his future seems set with a mate and job on the way. Paul goes out almost every night drinking and partying at a seedy tavern on the outskirts of town. One night he and Norman double date with Jessie and an Indian girl that Paul meets and b/c of the racist tendencies of the time, Paul almost gets into fight with the locals at the tavern for bringing the girl there. Norman gets Paul of this scrape, but he can't always be there to save him.Although the brothers have their sibling rivalry, the one thing that has always bonded them seems to be fly fishing, which their father raised them to do from childhood. There is a special, great scene near the end where the 3 have a beautiful moment of admiration of Paul's brilliance as a fly fisherman and it makes you realize how great he could have been had it not been for his violent, tormented nature.The film says a lot about familial relationships fathers and sons, brother and brother, even mothers and sons. And you can feel these ties more in what is not said and shown than it what is, which is especially true in a tense scene where Norman, the Reverend, and Mrs. MacLean are waiting for Paul one morning at breakfast after another night of hell-raising and debauchery, wondering if their deepest fears have been realized. Norman's reaction at the climax of this scene is one of my most favorite film moments.RIVER is a film of beauty but it is not purely a stylistic piece. It has characters that everyone can identify with on some level and I think everyone can relate to the family aspects. It also has moments of humor as well (the scene where Norman and Paul chastise Jessie's drunk city-slicker brother after waiting all morning to take him fly-fishing is hilarious). And those moments where Paul is on the brink of getting into insurmountable trouble are nail-biting and tense b/c of his violent nature. Watching Brad Pitt in these scenes is like watching a great young actor ready to break loose on the world. Sheffer deserves a lot of credit for being essentially the lead in this film and he carries it extremely well. The most brilliant aspect of the film is in Redford's narration as the older Norman. This is perhaps the best film with a voice-over EVER! A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is a special, beautiful, moving film that is Redford's greatest accomplishment!

Norman did not even think twice about taking revenge for his brother's death. I know he is a preacher's son, but come on. It was such a close nit community he could find out who was responsible, break their right hands & kill them. The hand breaking would let people know the death's were in retaliation for Paul's death. Furthermore, since Norman was moving to Chicago, there would be no chance of reprisals and besides, whoever was left would probably fear him. Also, Norman could have prevented Paul's death by caring and doing something about the fact that Paul owed unsavory people a lot of money. What did he think would happen? Norman is a terrible brother. "},{"Title":"Peace, help, innocence","Date":"15 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This movie left me in such a peaceful state of mind.

Very, very few movies move my heart and soul. Those 3 movies are Braveheart, Last of the Mohicans, and A River Runs Through It. Masculine movies to be sure, but beautiful as well. This movie is beautiful. The plot is not Hollywood type stuff, but rather it is more of a story. The river is the divide, the bridge, the time that cuts across one family's journey in and out of life. It is almost mystical how the story is told. I read the book after I saw the movie, and it was one of the most moving pieces of literature I have ever read, and the funny part is that it is fairly short-a short story to be exact. The plot of this movie is about life, and how the river, always constant provides the benchmark by which that life is measured. To be honest, I am surprised that Redford did such Americana-God type stuff as this, but he did. The brothers feelings in the movie are very heartfelt and wonderfully acted. The fight scene in which the brothers fight and Norman has tears in his eyes out of fear, rage, and sadness, reminded me of my fights during my youth. The lessons learned from that were transfixed onto the screen in a flash. That is brilliant film-making folks, to capture true human emotions and thoughts and impose them on believable real people. I loved how the fishing and the river keeps all things equal and true. This is a movie about life, and the sadness, hurt, regret, joy that is captured by one powerful river in Montana. The son Paul, played by Brad Pitt, goes his own way, and as a result becomes a master fly fisherman, and a gambler and a drunk. This movie (and book) shows that nothing is ever what it seems, and every person has gifts and liabilities that they must choose to deal with in their own way. Its also a movie that shows us that we can't save everyone, each person is endowed with gifts. But those gifts may also contain the seeds of our undoing. No more waxing poetic. This movie will fill your heart with ache and longing. But it will also make you feel something stirring deep within you at the most basic, fundamental level. All things merge into one, and A river runs through it.

Even after deluging us with garbage like BRIDE OF CHUCKIE, JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS, and ARMAGEDDON (or anything else from Michael Bay,) Redford's small, poignant film about the discovery of life and family on the banks of the mighty Blackfoot River, argues that a few in the business still possess integrity.Those looking to find an exact adaptation of the book are bound to be disappointed.  The novella was heavily weighted down with very detailed, technical fly fishing terms that would not have translated to the screen. Still, the story of Norman and Paul is fairly accurate, movingly played by Sheffer and Pitt, the cinematography is stunning and the voice-over narrative of Redford sets the emotional tone of the film.What's even more interesting is the story behind the film.  Mclean was almost 70 when he wrote the story and upon finishing the first draft, went to read the last twenty pages to his children, where he wept openly for the first time, commenting, I've been waiting 50 years to say these things.There's an informative documentary about the actual events in the making of the film entitled, Shadowcasting The Making Of A River Runs Through It. One sad and touching footnote included in the documentary is that Mclean died before the film was completed.If you haven't seen this masterpiece...don't waste anymore time.

Sheffer is also very good as Norman Maclean, but the best aspect of this movie is Tom Skerritt who seems born to play the role of Rev. Maclean.

I did not read the book until about the seventh viewing, but I was impressed with it even more.However, I was disheartened to find that the book is considered fiction. From my research into the life of Maclean I found that some of the scenes actually happened, but most of it was made up.  I am guessing, because I do not really know, that the film was more of an attempt at a biography because much of the film is based on Maclean's articles and lectures.Here are some major differences between the film and the novella for your perusal.  One, Paul and Norman were much older in the book, Norm in his mid-thirties, Paul in his early thirties.  The film shows the romance of Norm and Jesse, but they were already married in the book (in fact, when Neal gets burned it sets up some real conflict between the husband, Norm and the wife, Jesse).  Rev. Maclean had longed been retired in the book.One of the more disturbing things I have come across in my research is what I call the Phantom Line.  The line is it is the world with dew still on it, more touched by wonder and possiblity than any I have since known.  The film sets up to believe, from the opening narration through to the famous closing, that the spoken words are words of Maclean himself. This line, however, is from a literature critic writing on the novella, but a beautiful line nonetheless.Where the movie succeeds over the book is the examination of a life lived.  It is slow because life is slow, and is lived moment by moment. In the end all you have is your memories of those moments.  The book tends to live more in the moment.There are many differences and I could name a hundred.  These are perhaps the most interesting.  Buy the book, and read all three stories. Also read YOUNG MEN AND FIRE, also by Maclean.  This is a true story of the Mann Gulch fires, and it will fill you in on what happened to Jesse in her later years.  Whatever you do, understand that these two works of art are separate and should be kept that way.

Okay, but what about this character makes him interesting? The fact that he's a minister's son? That he dates women others might not? In the midst of a very picturesque location with lots of period props and costumes, there is absolutely nothing here to hold your attention.Does he engage in courtship with these women? Did he get his cues from another character who had loose morals? We don't really know, nor are we given any real insight, other than he's degenerating until he meets his end.

Craig Scheffer is the more studious and dependable of the two, and Brad Pitt is the charismatic ne'er-do-well born to raise as much hell as you can raise in Missoula, Montana (which isn't much, as it turns out). Reasons to recommend the film include several excellent performances, the rich small town nostalgia, and some convincing period flavor, but watching it can be a frustrating experience because, except for some annoying cosmetic drawbacks, it could have been a minor masterpiece. All the tight, TV-style close-ups don't suit the breathtaking and panoramic Rocky Mountain scenery; the intimate story certainly doesn't need the crutch of THX sound; and the intrusive voice-over narration, quoted by Mr. Redford himself from Norman Maclean's memoirs, almost ruins the movie by making it sound more like an illustrated book reading. The assumption is that American moviegoers won't understand anything unless the meaning is spelled out in totally unambiguous terms, and while the language is certainly pretty it belongs in print, not on screen.

The person who tells the story of Norman is Robert Redford.One example of drama is one day Norman and Paul when they were little went to play at the river where they fly fish. Norman asked Paul what he wanted to be when he grew. Paul said a boxer. Then Paul asked Norman the same. Norman said a boxer or a priest. Another example of drama is when Norman got back from going to school and he found out that Paul was an alcoholic.One example of suspense is one day Paul wanted to take Norman and Jesse Burns, who is acted by Emily Lloyd, to this bar. Paul had a date, but she was an Indian. When they came up to the door and the man at the door said the Indian girl couldn't come in, Paul said that he would pay him back. So Paul and his date were let in. Another example of suspense is when the police found Paul dead in a dumpster.One example of action is when Norman, Paul, and their dad went fly fishing. Paul caught the biggest fish for the first time. One example of romance is when Norman went to the Fourth of July weekend and met a girl named Jessie Burns. Norman and Paul went to this bar and Norman found out that Paul was heavily in debt from playing poker. Those are some examples of the movie that I found interesting.

This story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching movie narrated by the director, Robert Redford, playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead.Certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws.The closing lines sum up the point of the movie Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.

Although it is one of my favorites, every time I view it, I make a conscious effort to find fault in the technical, and film making aspects of it, and I fail to do so. The cinematography is splendid and flows so gracefully throughout. There is a reason for the slow moments, as some reviewers have pointed out, and I believe it is meant to provoke thought and feeling about the McLean clan and their languid, peaceful life in 1920s Montana. It is symbolic of the times. This is the story of how two brothers interact with each other, their father, their devotion to their mother, and what ultimately always brings them together, fly-fishing. The narration is note worthy and wouldn't be the same had they not added Norman McLean's eloquent words (narrated by Robert Redford). The acting is some of the finest performances you'll ever see. Notably from Brad Pitt,and Craig Sheffer, as the two brothers. However, most of the cast also turn in wonderful performances. If you are looking for action, this isn't the film for you. If however you are looking for a beautifully told, and visually satisfying film, this it. Treat yourself, sit back, relax and let yourself be brought back to a time that's all been but forgotten were it not for people like Mr.Redford for having had the vision of bringing it to film. It was a simpler time, when family, and community meant something. This film resonates peaceful integrity,grace and heart. If this means anything to you, don't miss this masterpiece.

I can see how people that don't fly fish won't have the same connection to this movie as I did. A must see for any fly fisher. Hopefully this movie gets some more people into the sport.

I will say its not the best movie ever made, but it has many great sequences that leave a lasting impression on me that just won't go away.  Being a fly-fisherman, I was happy to see a movie created to show parallels between life and fishing. If I were to ever pick one movie I wish I could've been in, it would be this one. Here are some of the best things about the movie*Spoilers*First, I loved all the still photograph shots, like of Norman working in the lumber industry.  I think it gave the movie an even better feeling of nostalgia. It was also a good way to show time differences. Second, I obviously enjoyed all the fishing scenes.  Anyone who ever views the scene of Paul trying to land that huge trout in the raging waters won't forget it anytime soon. What a perfect river. Third, I liked the fact that the characters aren't perfect. This movie is about life and enjoying the great things life has to offer. It is also about coping with difficult situations, especially when other family members are involved. I would like to say that Tom Skerritt plays a perfect early 1900's father. Fourth, the ending is one of the best ever, in my opinion. You have such an emotional high after Paul catches the big fish and all three (father and 2 sons) are seen laughing and having a good time.  Then the next scene is the depiction of Paul's death. WOW. The very end when the kids are shown again almost made me cry, and I don't cry for many things. There really isn't much you can put onto paper about it. And the ending verse speaks for itself. Personally, I don't know or care what I am haunted by waters means. Probably only Norman knows. I just take it for what it is... a great way to end a great movie.*END SPOILERS*So please see this movie if you haven't already, especially if you like movies about the outdoors and families. It will probably make you feel good that you have people around you to enjoy, and you'll realize what your missing if you've lost touch with those you care about. ...and a river runs through it.

Four come to mind (Clint Eastwood, Jodie Foster, Barbra Streisand & Robert Redford) who deserve this reputation.  They UP the production values and try to stamp 'class' and 'good taste' on every frame.  In doing so they've made two dozen lifeless, tedious, respectable movies that I can't stomach.  Instead of making movies, they construct boring arguments for the points they favor.This is one of those movies.  Early on you know it's not going to be daring new work.  It will be a hushed reverent look back at an chatty authors idyllic upbringing.  It has adapted-from-a-book written all over it; from the faux-poetic musings of the narrator to the snails pacing.  The approach is so even-handed that it ends up lifeless.  The hushed & reverent tone fearfully prevents you from interpreting the story in any way but the one Redford has conceived.  I wanted to heave.  Eons before Redfords comatose narration spells it out, you know that fly-fishing has been a metaphor for life (How sensitive... Ugh!).Worst of all, there is no dramatic arc to the movie.  You wait and wait and wait for something to actually happen instead of being told about it.  Every scene that might involve drama or emotion occurs off-screen.  A son arrives home from college after 6 years.  Redford eliminates the reunion.  Another son is killed.  The plot only mentions it & the mother leaves the screen to react to it.  It goes on & on.  Redford is one incredibly repressed director. (Horse Whisperer was equally horrible.) There is a preachy myth-making aspect to this movie that Redford might have picked up on 'The Natural.'  The material has a tiresome averaged quality to it.  In order to get the audience to identify, Redford supplies a generic look for every scene.  i.e. In the 20's scenes, Redford places exactly the hat Hollywood has trained you to picture on the characters heads, etc.  This robs it of any specific details that might make the viewpoint unique or fresh.This is a thin, thin story.  Historical views are much more engaging when they aren't shoving nostalgia down your throat.

Asses keep saying in their reviews, why were some parts narrated instead of shown? The answer, ass, is that if you are not present at an event, you can only relate it as it was related to you.Yes, it moves fairly slowly. He's only telling it like it happened. If you don't like the prospect of a film taking its time, then you should never have watched a movie titled A River Runs Through It anyway. How fast does it sound like it's going to move, moron?Though it does take its time developing the relationships between the brothers, their father, and others, an recounting specific memories of the narrator, I would not say it's boring because during these parts, you recognize moments from your own life and relationships. You may only think about things like this rarely, if ever.Try to understand your family members. And try your damned hardest to help them if they need it.Using strict film criteria, this film still scores pretty highly. It is beautiful to look at, and even the most crass moron cannot deny this. The plot, while differing in construction from that of most screenplays or other works of fiction, still scores highly because (as has already been proven by Lynchian film) a plot which creates its own structure in and of itself based on an element or elements of real life and which does not necessarily adhere to the strict plot pyramid can still succeed easily on a conscious AND a subconscious level to the viewer so long as it DOES adhere to the rules which it creates for itself and/or the rules which the area of life from which the plot structure is drawn dictate; if the film is not trying to bulls**t the viewer and instead supports its conclusions and the characters' actions with rational evidence and realistic mechanisms, then an unconventional plot structure can still make a favorable impression on an observer. River's plot structure was very straightforward, slow, and linear, but because this structure was a derivative of life experiences through the reference frame of a human being in a world where most events are beyond human control, few events remain in our control, and all events stand to be observed by us, the developments in the plot all play out quite logically and sequentially and in quite a familiar fashion. The only persons who have severe issues with the plot or pacing of A River Runs Through It are most likely those who either do not have a family at all, do not have good interaction with family members, or do not give much thought to family members, and are thereby unfamiliar with the area of human experience from whence the quintessential element of the plot structure springs and therefore unable to appreciate the film's veracity in some places as well-done artistic presentation; unfamiliar with circumstances similar to those presented in the film and are unable to recognize the inherent truth of what is shown on film. The plot, in short, was uncommon for its truthfulness. The acting was very solid. The direction was sensitive to the source material for the screenplay as well as the screenplay itself. And, as I mentioned earlier, the cinematography is very well done.The end result is that this film is very solid. Very good, even. Some would say poetic, but I don't get into all that sentimental crap. All you can say is that on a technical level, the film is virtually devoid of mistakes, and on an artistic level, it was very full with the underlying veracity and emotional content which a piece of art grounded firmly in real life should provide. People who malign the film are not family-oriented and probably do not value memories very much, either. That's basically all this film is a representation of a memories. It is not hard to understand, but it is not for everyone because the family content may not meet some people's expectations as movie-script stuff. But I actually believe this film does a great job at being easy to watch, well-acted, great to look at and listen to, and also at not being boring, given the potential.

Its lyrical passages about fly fishing bring to mind newspaper sports feature writing at its worst, and the creepy antics of its macho protagonists are not pleasant from a civilized female perspective. But the very point of the story it seems to me is that these men are so emotionally immature and alienated that their only true joy in life is the self-absorbed (and highly competitive) act of luring a strong healthy fish to its death. Maclean expressed these experiences with tremendous honesty that makes his painful attempts at fine writing worth squelching through.The film version hangs on to the Hemingwayesque flourishes (replicated in its prettily photographed vistas of mountains and rivers and a tendency to hit overcrank when something significant is happening at the end of one of the fly fishermen's lines) but regrettably jettisons the honesty. The story's setting is changed from 1937 (in the depths of the Depression, when an ability to catch good fish for supper had a very different connotation) to sometime in the twenties, and the brothers are correspondingly in their early twenties, which gives their bawdy, irresponsible antics a much different connotation than it did when the same characters in the book pulled them well into their thirties. Refocusing the story line from the brothers' inarticulate love for one another to a standard meet cute romance between Norman and his future wife Jess was probably good for box office, but all I could think of watching Brad Pitt with his strawberry blond dye job and Emily Lloyd slinking around in her blonde finger-wave wig and fragile linen dresses was that Redford was reliving some fixation that originated twenty years previously during the filming of The Great Gatsby.I think this is a bad film, and I found myself horribly impatient with it. But I can also see why so many people enjoy it. The romance, the Sierra Club cinematography and cheap thrill gags like the pop-up scare after the whitewater boating adventure and the ride through a train tunnel in a tin lizzie are all calculated audience pleasers. And it's nice that Maclean's heirs got the royalties for the use of the old man's title.

The river symbolizes the life of Macleans.Blackfoot River in Montana represents routine life of Presbyterian Maclean family. Reverend Maclean raised his sons very well both through positivist education and morality. But he can't throughly communicate with his sons actually he couldn't express his feelings not just great ones but also daily ones. However he develops a communication channel which is fly fishing in Blackfoot River. The river resembles the life and all the Maclean men go into life and live it through fishing. When they hunt fish from river actually they live different events from their life. Reverend obsessively bind to fishing because he couldn't find another way of communicate with his beloved sons. He was afraid that if he express himself through words may be their sons can't get him or misunderstand. By the way Reverend is not totally aware of this method just do it instinctively. When times passes boys grew up. Older brother Norman actually can't get the real meaning of fly fishing he just perceived it as a great hobby of his family and make it for fun. On the other side, Paul grasp the idea. Paul as like as his father obsessed with fly fishing. Unfortunately he steps forward and fixate himself to Montana, he thanked best years of his lives for The River. He creates a state of belonging to his homeland. You could call it patriotism to the motherland or public spirit through the river. But when Paul and everyone around him (their childhood friends too)get older the whole situation changes. Now they become adults they have to take higher education, they have to find a women and marry her or find a regular job. Because of Norman's naivety on The River he quickly left home actually forget The River and his family relation and fishing of course. But that is not the same story for Paul he can't go far away from The River. He became a local journalist and refused to promote. He periodically visits hist father and mother and go out fishing with Reverend. If you carefully watch the movie you realize that even though Norman more asocial than Paul, he found Jessie Burns to marry with her. On the other hand Paul hasn't got any serious relations and has not intention of career-promotion. Norman wants to be an important man. Reverend actually couldn't think that his fly fishing method could cause one of his son to captivating in one sense trapped with Montana. Norman's return after graduation and his plans about marriage makes Paul and reverend happy and hopeful. However the reality is a little bit different. Norman is unsure about his career this saddened his father and at the last fly-fishing scene of Macleans when Norman expresses his idea about permanently moving abroad and propose him to come with Jesse and him aggrieved Paul. Paul and Reverend just want a stable, routine and happy life altogether with Mother Maclean and Norman's new family. Paul as in his childhood act aggressively and in time he finds a way of exit from dissatisfaction of his changing life through alcoholism and gambling. Reverend seek the situation but can't do anything besides approve Norman's wishes and ignore Paul's rebellion. When Norman ask Jessie's brother Neal to take out fishing Paul understands that everything is changing and nothing will be the same as in his childhood. But he never makes clear himself to his brother. The zenith of the movie is final fishing scene. Reverend leave his sons alone and when Norman invite Paul with them to leave Montana he respond that he will never leave his home. For last chance to try Norman understand them Paul tries a last chance, a last communication shot. Paul after a very hard hunting catches a big fish. Reverend call it as an art and Norman take a photo of Paul and his hunt. In that moment Norman really gets the idea of fly-fishing. Paul tried another shot when they were young and take a boat with their friends to fall down from a steep ravine on Blackfoot River but Norman couldn't got it. This time Norman gets something but do nothing. Paul was in trouble because of his gambling problem if he didn't fixate himself to Montana and accept the invitation of his brother most probably he wouldn't die. After that day in the morning police officers called Norman to inform Paul killed most probably because of gambling. Norman understand that Paul killed himself consciously because gamblers refused to let Paul to play card (he is already in debt); however, he illogically demand it. Then Norman tell Paul's dead to his father. At the last scene when Reverend addressing a speech on his congregation he talked about understanding each other,expression of feelings within a family or a communion. Norman with a sad face blame himself because he can't get his family's communication medium; fly fishing and perceived The River as just a river. Now he has a good career, beloved wife and kids but lost his brother and also his parents' joy of life. This is the greatest Redford movie and best performance of Pitt. Actually Pitt couldn't exceed Paul Maclane role.

The film is set in Montana at the turn of the century. It explores the bonds that tie their family together and the differences that drive them apart against the backdrop of a beautiful landscape.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER Understanding what binds us to one another and understanding how seemingly simple things are the glue that cement our relationships to one another even as we chart different courses in our lives.PROS AND CONS This is a film that I had seen before and I wanted to watch it again to see if it was still as good as I remembered it. It is a good film, although it is very subtle and introspective. This was one of Robert Redford's first attempts at movie making from behind the camera. He does not appear on screen but does lend his voice as the narrator.Without giving too much away, this is a film about fly fishing. Not the art of fishing itself, but how a common, shared experience brings people together regardless of how much they grow apart. In this film, the two brothers grow into men of different temperaments and ideals. However, both of them share the same life long passion that was taught to them by their father.This passion is the unseen thread that holds the family together. Many families have this type of thread but it can take different forms. The mother driving her daughter to figure-skating practice week after week which eventually stretches into years. The father and son that tinker on their 57 Chevy for decades in the garage. The things that seem meaningless at first, but when looked back upon, create a continuity that makes us who we are at our core.This film is exceptional in many ways. As a period piece, it makes the viewer long to live in rural Montana before World War I. Tom Skerritt as the father and the young Brad Pitt as his younger son give exceptional performances. I found the older son played by Craig Sheffer to be a bit emotionless and repressed. His love affair with the home town girl appears a bit forced at times and does not appear to move the plot forward much.In the end, the eldest son stands along in the river where so much was learned and you can sense his anguish at what he has lost during the course of his life. The final lines of the film pretty much sum it up. In the end, all things run together into one, and a river runs through it. And if you listen to the waters you can hear their voices.......I am haunted by waters. All in all, a beautiful film that makes us pause at the end and think about what is really important.

In attempting to bring forth the beauty of the America of yesterday, Robert Redford, an actor more known for his pretty features than his capacity to render deep, transformative performances, creates this time capsule of a film that tells the retrospective story of Norman MacLean, An American Writer, and his coming of age.The movie was responsible for one thing maximizing on Brad Pitt's almost too-good looks, and in a way, it's as if Redford had found a doppelganger to substitute for his own younger self in this movie. So where the focus from the movie, being Norman MacLean (played in an unmemorable way by Craig Sheffer who could have after this gone to better things but has since disappeared into the fog of forgetfulness and grade F movies), becomes a moot point.A fairly inactive movie that looks as if Turner had painted it with love and care. It never really steps out of its shell and bothers to say anything, and much of what happens just sits there and basks in the rays of cute that Redford has given it. It's the reason that the British are so good at telling static stories where the foliage and the costumes may apparently take precedence over everything else, but then neither Pitt nor Sheffer are British and wouldn't know how to act in this type of movie.It's for this reason that A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT stays put where it is, which is as a pretty little postcard from a friend in the middle of a travelogue.

I expected lots of beautiful scenery and a slow pace. What I did not expect was that nothing at all would ever happen on screen. Why were all the major plot points narrated instead of filmed? The actors were fabulous; it's a shame they didn't have much of a chance to act. By the end I had given up caring what was going to happen. I felt very detached from this movie, because it felt like someone else telling me about a movie they saw. It was like listening to the book on tape. This, coupled with the glacial pace made the movie completely unbearable. Also predictable - **********SPOILER AHEAD*************- was there anyone who didn't know that Brad Pitt's character was going to die at the end of this?  Was there anyone who didn't know that Norman wouldn't ever actually leave Montana? What could have been a great movie turned into nothing more than a fly fishing tutorial.

Obviously, director ROBERT REDFORD meant this to be a tribute to the glories of the environment, being the radical conservationist that he's turned out to be. And as such, it does succeed--for it's a beautiful film to look at.But by the time the end credits roll, you realize that what there is of a story is so vague in outline, so weak in imparting any truths, so muddled in whatever message was intended, that it's been a waste of a couple of hours of your life.CRAIG SHEFFER is merely bland as the older brother who secretly envies the free-wheeling, laid back lifestyle of his fly-fishing brother, BRAD PITT. Pitt crumbles under the conventions of having a strict religious upbringing from his father TOM SKERRITT. During the course of the story, the two brothers are at odds over many things and have the usual fights and squabbles. By the end, one brother finds the right path while the other ends his life in misery. That's about it for the plot outline.It's never clear, though, what the message is that Redford is trying to get across. The film's only strength is the picture postcard views of Montana, impressively photographed. The scenery serves as a nice background for a very weak drama that really goes nowhere and ends up being a bore rather than capturing us with an intriguing storyline.

Redford has done himself no favours by trying too hard to make it cinematic but his talents do not meet his intentions. It directing simply looks and feels amateurish. On another negative note - The only interesting bits were the fly fishing scenes. The rest of the story was desperately poor. It was simply trying to be too placid and relaxed. I was pleased when it ended.To its advantage are - excellent casting, fine acting, impressive use of cool and texture and the fact that it eventually finished. The scene with the brother is the only slightly interesting event in a rather dull life. Even Paul's incident could spur no more than a mumour of Please say this is nearly over. It is a very 'American' film. Which is no bad thing if you happen to like this genre. All this, with subtle undertones of a pro-Christian, pro American, homely i'll have a apple pie ma story coupled with bits and pieces of how great Montana is. I hasten to add that the brother's capricous relationship was portrayed with half-hearted and quite limited effort. A lame attempt all round. But i expect it is the Fisherman's bible none-the-less. I won't be in a hurry to watch it again.

Nature doesn't get a whole lot prettier than this. The minister in here (Tom Skerritt) is shown in a kindly light, which is a bit unusual with the secular film business.THE BAD -The story gets boring in spots, there is too much usage of the Lord's name in vain, mainly by the two sons of the minister, particularly Brad Pitt's character. The minister's sermons sound like secular humanistic poetry readings, nothing about Christ. It sounds like Redford wrote the sermons.

However, the story is formulaic and occasionally boring. The movie is an example of how style does not overcome lack of substance. Furthermore, I couldn't fully grasp the concept of how fishing symbolizes life. Fishing is stupid and pointless; life is awesome.

This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw The Fast And The Furious. So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the scenery and costumes were nice.

Its images make me want to move back to Montana, to breath the air, to enjoy the people, maybe, even to fish. Yet it's a testament to the beauty of Montana that causes the movie to fail; Montana is so big and Norman Maclean's story, while lovely and touching in itself, doesn't fit the state.Now, I know I'm in a minority here. Just read some of the other comments and you would think ARRTI is a gift from God, but I just didn't believe there was enough story here, enough flesh and blood for the characters. Everyone seemed underused--there's no one person who is completely fleshed out as a real person. They come close, but the cast and its story seem somehow forced, as if Redford believed that if he shot the movie with just the right filters and filled it with poetic narration, he'd get the depth of emotion the script just couldn't deliver.Ultimately, the movie was a pleasant experience (and I really would like to go fishing, although I won't catch and release--I'm eating' those bad boys!), but I felt that I had missed the greatness, the huge commonality of a beautiful and deeply thoughtful story of brothers and love and romance and fly fishing as art. I'll I got was two hours of lovely photography and Brad Pitt.For some viewers, that would be just fine. For me, I wanted something from deeper waters.

The story of two brothers growing up in Montana, Redford's film is best described as nice.  The boys' father is a Presbyterian minister, the young men themselves are basically decent despite their rebellion, and except for a few utterings of g--damn and son of a bitch, there is no foul language (In this era in which the F word emerges repeatedly from the mouths of screen actors, an occasional g--damn has been thoroughly reduced to innocuosness).  Alas, there is little excitement either.  This is what I call a Sunday afternoon movie  rural, timeless, and ultimately sad.  One senses time ticking away as the images flicker by. One may also sense one's patience running out waiting for the thing to end. I was relieved when it did.

Great landscapes, Redford acting well.Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.Definitely NOT a must-see (3 / 10) "},{"Title":"Spent most of the movie waiting for it to begin...it never did.","Date":"10 August 2003","Score":"7 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This movie has beautiful scenery.
