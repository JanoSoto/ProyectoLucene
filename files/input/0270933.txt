[{"Title":"A Fantastic Retelling","Date":"29 June 2005","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Animation, Drama","Review":" For those who have seen the Escaflowne television series know that it was a beautifully complex shoujou anime with plenty of action, adventure, and romance.The movie, however, is a completely different animal. Most viewers try to compare the television series to the movie, and thus usually disregard the movie as trash, as it is not a faithful retelling of the series. So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, but have seen the series, remember they are two completely different creatures, each wonderful and unique.The most noticeable change is in the character design. Nobuteru Yuuki (who also did the designs for Chrono Cross, X, and Record of Lodess War) slightly altered the character's distinctive looks from the TV series. They now closely resemble the characters from Chrono Cross (the similarity between Millerna and Kid is the most obvious). The plot was also trimmed of the intricate subplots to fit into a decent running time, and thus some of the characters from the series do not appear. The biggest change is the inclusion of more action and violence, so we're talking flying body parts and lots of blood spraying. This was done to attract more males to the fanbase as the TV series had a fanbase that was 80% female.Other things, however, haven't changed. Yoko Kanno and her partner Hajime Mizoguchi return with an excellent score of blended nationalities to give it a truly unique sound that makes it seem as if we are really listening to the music from another world.Overall, the movie is an excellent example of anime at its best. Between the quality of the animation and overall production, this movie is a must see for anyone who loves any form of animation.

However, if the same audience wants to drown in the glory of wonderful storytelling, a beautiful soundtrack worthy of Williams, and heartstopping animation, this is the perfect film for them.Escaflowne A Girl From Gaea is loosely based on the already popular series Tenkuu no Escaflowne, where Hitomi, a young school girl with psychic powers, is whisked away to the magical land of Gaea, filled with mystical creatures, gallant knights, and gigantic suits of armor. However, here, the happy Hitomi and the peaceful Van are very much gone.  The movie opens with Van brutally slaying a group of enemies and Hitomi rethinking the decision to hand a suicide note she has written over to her best friend Yukari.  This is a very dark, but compelling Escaflowne.  Much of the storyline from the series has been changed dramatically, as one can tell, but it gives the movie it's own original feel and one does not have to be familiar with the series to enjoy the movie.  The soundtrack, once again handled very nicely by Yoko Kanno, is absolutely top-notch and might remind one of the power of John Williams' score to Star Wars.  The animation is very different as well, more mature and detailed than the average anime series.  Older teens will love it, but smaller children familiar with the series might find the action too intense, some scenes and animation echoing the works of Akira Kurosawa, particularly Ran.I have only seen bootleg copies of this, but I hope the rumour of the movie coming stateside is true and we American otaku will get to enjoy the majesty that is Escaflowne A Girl From Gaea on a theatre screen.  Anything less cannot do it justice.

With a running time of 98 min. events and character development seem rushed and unfulfilled. We never really get to know the characters and even though many viewers will have already seen the TV series that's still no excuse for the lack of content. Hitomi seems to shift from a depressed school girl on the verge of suicide to a strong supportive heroine without much coaxing or personal experience. The full legend of the Escaflowne and Wing Goddess as well as the mythology of Gaia are also never fleshed out for us. The final confrentation between the two brothers is a far cry from what could have been. And the ending leaves something to be desired as well, not as fairy tale as some might have wanted. However inspite of these problems I still enjoyed Escaflowne the Movie. It is a feast for the eyes and ears, and as a theatrical adaption it has no problem standing on its own.

I knew it was supposed to be a retelling and not a summary of the series, but even on that level, I didn't really get Hitomi's reason for caring so much for Van all of a sudden, why that blonde captain (Allen, as I learned later) was even there, or what the hell Dune (or Folken, take your pick) was all about.  The confrontation with Dune was so incredibly anti-climactic that I almost hoped for that old horror cliche of the villain coming back to life a few times to up his kill stats.  No such luck, though.Having just gone through a marathon session with the series (all twenty-six episodes in two days), I decided to watch the movie again this morning.  Well, I had fun identifying all the characters from the series, who were all--down to the cat girls--developed into realistic characters throughout the television series, and it was kind of interesting to compare Hitomi's character (in the movie, she's totally depressed but realized the pain she was causing others; in the series, she was lively, but in being so, she missed the signs that she was hurting people).  However, the story (which recasts Hitomi as a Winged Goddess figure instead of a girl with skills at fortune telling, and Van into an uncontrollably violent person, but sweet and gentle when he's not killing people) isn't all that interesting (and seems to have been more influenced by the Evangelion series and movies than by Escaflowne), and 96 minutes is far too short a time to tell what should have been a sweeping epic.  Instead, despite the claims that it is a retelling, it ends up feeling even more like a truncation of the series.That said, I thought the animation was good (in an anime genre sort of way--I wouldn't expect a lot of other people to care too much for it, the way that even anime haters tend to like Studio Ghibli films), and the design for Hitomi, though not as kawaii as the series, really did fit with the darker tone of the movie.6/10 "},{"Title":"The wonderfully animated movie that brings us back to the world Gaea!","Date":"10 November 2002","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Animation, Drama","Review":"  Escaflowne the movie is my favorite Anime feature film.  This film, albeit darker and a bit more brooding story, it still contains the wonderful pastel colors of the OVA television series, and is one of the finest pieces of traditional animation I've seen in years.  Also most of the original voice cast returns for this feature.  In my personal opinion, the Escaflowne American voice cast is right on par with their Japanese counterparts.  The only series I can openly say this about.  Yoko Kano once again writes a wonderful musical score, reminding us why we fell in love with the series to begin with.  It's sadder music with a more mystical feel, but fits the mood of the feature film.  The characters and their costumes were redesigned, but if you found the long pointy noses and girly look of the men of the OVA to be laughable, then the movie will strike you with awe.  The realism of the character design was upped for this big budget feature, and even though the story and universe is a bit altered, it's still a treat to be back with Hitomi on her adventures in Gaea once again.

Nothing has been done that would compromise any of the standards you would expect from an anime. Escaflowne is a reflective fable, while maintaining visually articulate animation, with many colorful characters and powerful brooding conflict. The rivalry between Van and Folken, though never truly finalized, is so intense, that it could have dominated the film at will had it needed to.A band of renegades, sworn to destroy an evil empire after their own lands were annihilated, find the legendary Dragon Armor, Escaflowne, and a young girl inside. The girl herself, from our own world, was somehow brought to the world of Gaea and seeks answers while befriending the one sworn to protect her.Somehow I'd like to figure out how Dilandau's fate ended the way it was. The key part to Escaflowne is that of the relationship between Van and Hatomi. The fable of how loneliness and its effect on yourself and others captures your attention and somewhat brings the film into focus. The screenplay otherwise would concentrate on its endless imagination of the world of Gaea and the characters that exist within it. Fans of anime would assuredly enjoy Escaflowne for all it represents. Non-fans may need a friendly guide to help explain what's going on from the beginning, as the first 30 minutes brings more questions than answers!

On its own this movie had every potential to be great - decent story world and concept, the problem is that it fell into the limbo of relying on the series too much and too little.The first half of the movie is truly a great watch - you see old faces and nods to secondary characters (the cats in the nightclub are a nice touch). The problem is that in the second half it sort of falls apart - it seems to lose focus and rely on clichés and poor on screen chemistry for the lovers.The reason for this is that the first hour or so pretty much relies on the first few episodes of the series - girl meets boy but is afraid, the world itself is introduced and so forth, but in the last hour they try to cram the remaining 24 episodes of plot into the movie. While they negate a large amount of the less relevant details in the series, the fact that they try to throw a love that only develops at the end of 24 episodes of questioning (Between Hitomi and Van) into about 30 minutes, and it just seems forced.So in the end the movie would've been better had it not relied on the overreaching plot of the series and made its own way in the world. (or maybe do the opposite and be set at the end of the series like the Evangelin movies).At any rate, I did feel a little cheated by the apparent lack of mech fights and 'brother battle' at the end. 3/5  "}{"Title":"Great Animation, good movie","Date":"18 August 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Animation, Drama","Review":"  The first thing that struck me about this film was the detailed animation and vividness of the colors.

I think that's a good thing.So often I watch anime that's been hailed as the best thing since sliced bread, and compared to other more mainstream (read non-anime) features, IMO it doesn't even come close.  I think fans of sub-genres tend to be blind to real critique of their favorite subjects, because they need to justify their excessive interest in it.That being said, you still need to compare like-genre films to one another - at least to some degree, and I think in this case Escaflowne does a great job standing up to its competitors.Someone had previously mentioned that the faces in this feature were rather badly drawn, and I tend to agree - it's odd, because the quality of the rest of the scenes/ scenery, is relatively good.  The plot in this film, as in most anime is VERY disconnected, with whole chunks missing at parts.  Rewinding certainly helps when watching this. However, as with most good anime, even if there is some plot missing, the end message is fairly clear.  The score is amazing.  It's rare you hear this kind of music in regular movies, much less an animated feature.In general, I would recommend watching this on DVD, as you will want to rewind at some points, and try to understand certain elements, and/or watch the fast scenes a few more times.

Everything in the film has been copied from somewhere else, but has lost its context in the process, leaving a soulless, formulaic film. Having been adapted from a TV series, the story makes very little sense and is filled with superfluous characters. This isn't that big a problem, as you will have probably heard the plot a million times before, and every character fits into a tired anime stereotype. There's the angsty schoolgirl (who for some reason wears her uniform for the entirety of her stay in fantasyland), Mr. Long Hair Big Eyes Big Sword, Cat-Girl, etcetera. The dialogue is equally clichéd, as you would expect from such cookie cutter characters. More than that, the clichés are very poorly done, and make little sense. For example, the Hotheaded Hero is about to kill the Schoolgirl heroine (well he is waving his sword around and saying he will) when his boss orders him not to. Of course, being hot-headed he then attacks his boss and they proceed to fight. The worst thing about this film, however, is the voice acting. I realise that the kind of people who would like Escaflowne would be listening to the original Japanese anyway, but the dub was particularly bad. The animation and artistic direction, while technically proficient, is also riddled with lazy unoriginality. When some of the characters sprout angel wings, as they tend to do occasionally, the air is immediately filled with hundreds of feathers, perhaps symbolising something but more likely hollow eye candy. The wings must be moulting at an alarming rate. Anyway, if you have read this far you will have got the message; Escaflowne is an exercise in formulaic shallowness.

Like the series, it is about a girl named Hitomi, who hates her life and wants to escape from everything. Her wish comes true and she is magically to the world of Gaea.In the series, an empire called Zaibach was trying to harness the power of Atlantis so everyone's dreams can come true. In the movie, Zaibach is replaced with the Black Dragon clan, and the Black Dragon Clan is trying to destroy the world so everyone's sorrow can be lifted. The Emperor of Zaibach, Dornkirk is absent from the movie, replacing him with Folken who was also in the series. Folken, my favorite character from the series, is turned from a man who believes he is doing the right thing but isn't, into a stereotypical villain who simply wants to destroy the world.Out of nowhere towards the beginning of third act of the movie, suddenly the dragon armor (Guymelefs in the series) Escaflowne has the power to destroy the world. Whether or not it destroys the world, rests in the wish of Hitomi, who is believed to be the legendary Wing Goddess.Everything is solved so quickly by the end. The end fight scene is unexciting and by that time, I just didn't care about the rest of the movie.Its hard to say whats exactly wrong with the movie.

The last scene made me cry.I will often value a movie great when it stands out on several levels, and in this case the strongest feeling I came away with was a sincere empathy for the characters. Really great movies will do that, and I think this is one.

The charm that the Escaflowne series had has not been lost and is brought to life again in this feature length film.Characters are drawn beautifully, and in more detail - some looking completely different (millerna seems to have undergone a full makeover and is now unrecognisable), the music is as awe-inspiring as it was in the series, the animation is much smoother, but the storyline has changed drastically - though it is still told wonderfully.I have to say that as a fan of the series romance between Van and Hitomi, I was fairly disappointed with the lack of it in the film - Though don't get me wrong, you can still sense something between them.This film is one of the best anime films I've seen, and if you like anime you can really get into and understand then this is the one for you (though I recommend watching the series before if you can).Any fan of anime has to watch this, it's truly beautiful.

This is the first anime movie I've viewed since Princess Mononoke and Blue Submarine No. 6 that I think can compare in both story and animation. My only word of caution is not to come to this expecting a continuation of the series; the movie follows a completely different storyline, and even the characters, though similar in appearance and attitude, have been changed.However, this does not change the quality of the movie itself. It's one of the most beautifully animated features I've ever seen, with a stunning soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, and a good storyline. I'll admit, the storyline for the series was probably a bit better, but that doesn't lessen the quality of the work.My biggest relief was that the voice actors of the series returned; I was highly impressed by the work they did, and I believe that this is some of their best so far. Andrew Francis, the voice of Dilandau Albatou, remains one of my favorite voice actors, and his work on the movie simply stunned me.I was also quite impressed with the updated characters; my favorite was the update to Allen Schezar, and my second favorite to Merle. I believe both versions of Dilandau Albatou and Van Fanell were fitting, but the movie updates suit them just fine. My only disappointment was the update to Hitomi Kanzaki, the main character. I was happy to see them change her outfit and appearance, but the personality change was rather upsetting. However, the movie makes up for that by having wonderful character development, thus my complaints are resolved.The movie did have a slightly rushed feeling, but it's hard to fit what wants to be a long story into the time limits. I think they did a wonderful job with the constraints they had, and that this is most certainly something any anime lover should see. Let me remind you again that this movie is not a continuation of the series, so please don't watch in the hopes of finding more to the original story. This is a complete re-telling.All in all, I think this is a wonderful movie; the story is good, the characters are colorful, the music is excellent, the visual is stunning, and the voices are, as always, amazing. It's well directed, well designed, and well made. I would recommend this movie on my top list of choices without a second thought.

For one it changed my opinion on anime, but also introduced me to a message board, where I met an incredible person.However, my comments are about the movie, and not the show, and about the show itself, and not about the good things that happened to me after watching it.The show run was amazing, and the final DVD had a Trailer of the movie. I was amazed by it, however, I was warned it would not be like the series. That didnt matter to me, and I went to see it.The movie was confusing, they did not explain WHY the characters were able to use this power, and even though the graphics were stunning, it was not enough to save this movie from a terrible, unexplained plot.

I found Neon Genesis Evangelion mildly interesting, didn't understand Lain and wondered what was the point of FLCL.This movie however is really good. The animation and the music are beautiful. And the story is really good and well told. I will watch the TV series as soon as I can, even though it's said to be totally different. But I don't care. I want to dig deeper in universe of Escaflowne.This is a movie you should see even if you don't like anime at all!

And also, have you ever read the Escaflowne mangas? There were two series that I remember, and both were actually very different from each other, and I mean HUGELY different. So stop complaining, Escaflowne is not a single story, it is the essence, the spirit behind many stories, like different sides to a cube.Now, on the way the movie is darker than the series, it is very true, but also, very justified. In the series, Fanelia was obliterated, but Van seemed hardly traumatized by it, he did not become the revengeful prince that he should have been portrayed as. Now, in the movie, he is - do you seriously think, if you were the ruler of a kingdom, if it was to be reduced to ashes before your very eyes, you wouldn't become filled with so much hate and be deeply depressed - as he feels like he is the last of his kind, much like a Last of the Mohicans.Technically, it is beautiful, this movie just screams ambiance. Where the series were very brilliantly colored, and therefore not visually symbolistic of the underlying apocalyptic theme (at least, until the last few episodes), in the movie, the overall feel in most visuals is one of sadness, pain, despair, darkness. Many barren and desolate landscapes go on to show just how much the world is suffering and in need of a savior. And the way Escaflowne merges with Van, even to the point of sharing blood, it makes it all very visceral, and has a much more 'samurai' kind of spirit behind it - because of its inherent link to blood and mortality - than the high-fantasy theme of the series.The characters may seem scarred, but let's face it, the destruction of your homeland, the death of your loved ones, the fear of witnessing the annihilation of your world... ...in short, war; well, it is not a very happy subject and quite frankly, it scars people, it affects them. Under that light, I guess I can safely say that as depressing as it may be, the movie is much more realistic in its approach to the psychology of its characters than the happier-feeling series.Musically, it couldn't have been better. The soundtrack is a Wagnerian opus of a score, really; the music alone makes it worthwhile to sit through the movie.Bottom line is If you're looking for the series, better watch the series; if you're looking for a different Escaflowne, darker, more mature, more realistic, and just great Anime, you owe it yourself to check this one out.

However, the movie is a lot darker, a lot of characters in the series have been left out, and some events have been altered, so do not expect to see a movie that stays true to the series.Does that make it bad movie? No, not at all.

I wanted to get this for my collection, and I did. My father bought me the collector's edition for Christmas and I enjoyed it.I know that this movie does not follow the series, and the storyline is different but is not the same as the series. It was cool to see some of the characters from the show, and of course the Guymelef Escaflowne. I know it's a shame we never get to see Allen's Guymelef Sherazade in the movie, and of course the flying ship, the Crusade. Another thing, I liked about this movie is the music. I do like the Escaflowne theme, and some of the new music that was never used in the series. The movie also have the same voice cast that did the series and I do believe they did a good job. So in closing to this review,if you like the series,then you got to see this movie. You'll see what I mean,and it's the best.

The opening few minutes are promising with some alright swordplay, but after that there is no action for an hour. The soundtrack, which everyone seems to be lavishing heaps of attention on, is HORRIBLE ! It drowns out half the lines that are spoken in the movie, and is otherwise COMPLETELY out of place in the movie. It goes from horrible japanese pop to horrible chamber music to horrible orchestral, which is hard for me to say because I love orchestral music. Don't waste your time with this pile of garbage; rent Akira instead. "},{"Title":"Very powerful!

The movie all begins about this one high school girl named Hitomi who keeps having these weird dreams that go through her mind. So then she gets sent to this different world the moment she wakes up! Van the Prince of an abandon kingdom is now trying to defeat his evil brother Folken who is now trying to destroy the Empire of Zaibach.
