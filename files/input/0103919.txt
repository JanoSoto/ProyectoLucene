I'd heard a lot about it, read about it, etc but wrote it off as probably stupid like most of the other horror movies I had so wanted to see.  So, it wasn't until many years after the movie's release that I finally saw it.  And boy am I glad I did!Surprisingly, the acting is fabulous...especially for a horror movie.  Each character portrayed fantastically so as to add to the movie, rather than detract.  No one really went over the top or became TOO dramatic.  Overall, each character was portrayed realistically.  As for the plot absolutely wonderful premise playing on the Bloody Mary urban legend. Surprisingly, the movie delivers on aspects of believabilty.  Of course we don't *really* expect Candyman to pop out of a mirror, but how many of us have started the Bloody Mary chant only to stop at the very last one, not daring to continue?  Our fears lie behind what COULD happen and the possibility that maybe..just maybe it's all real.  Candyman plays on that fear and takes us even further over the edge.The movie rids itself of the typical cliches  (white, undefeatable stalker chasing half naked twits) and allows itself to be an entirely enjoyable, CEREBRAL horror movie.  At first we wonder if the Candyman is perhaps just a person pretending to be him, then we start to question Helen's own sanity...wondering perhaps if SHE isn't the real Candyman.  Eventually, the movie leads us to an ending that answers our questions but doesn't shove those answers down our throat.  Candyman also does what very few horror movies are capable of  it succeeded in having a strong ending rather than fizzling out during the last 10-15 minutes.The setting and atmosphere are top notch.  Using Chicago and Cabrini Green as its stage was perfect...bringing into play racial issues without going over the top or getting in your face to the point of losing its focus.  The music in Candyman adds a mysterious mood that matches the dark, dismal atmosphere of the lone apartments in Cabrini Green.All in all on my horror movie scale, I give Candyman a 10.  To me, it was purely artistic and absolutely enjoyable.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone even slightly interested in horror movies.

Suffice to say, it has a genuinely uncomfortable premise, uncompromising execution and a bone jarringly lonely score by Philip Glass. Tony Todd is exceptional as the hollow-voiced titular creature; a lost soul brought to life by the whispers of myth. At once heartbreaking and terrifying this could be the definitive latter day horror movie monster- if it wasn't just that little bit too close to Hellraiser's Pinhead. But, when you have a winning combination of elegance and disgust in a verbose, cultured villain, why alter it too much?Virginia Madsen convinces totally as Helen; and you can almost see all the cast acting their little socks off so as not to let the side down. So good, in fact, that I'm struggling to find one bad thing to say about it.I read here, that in the eyes of one viewer, it dwells on the nastier things in life and wasn't a nice film. I can think of no greater compliment for a truly adult horror movie. No dear, you won't find happy teens in pastel t-shirts having slumber parties and discussing trendy scary movies, while some rap star tries to sell records on the soundtrack. This is a grown up film for grown up people. There is a reason horror films are for adults, and that reason is 'Candyman'. "},{"Title":"Who wants candy now, huh?

This film features a very rare and successful combination of both creepy atmosphere and visual ingeniousness. Whereas most movies (especially during the 90's) can hardly focus on any of these essential horror elements, Bernard Rose masterfully succeeds in stuffing his film with genuine tension as well as shocking gore-images. The plot centers on doctoral student Helen (underrated actress Virginia Madsen in her best role) who becomes obsessed with the urban legend of a hook-handed killer that terrorizes the pauperized ghettos of the nearby Cabrini Green. Needless to say that the Candyman-myth gets a little too realistic for Helen, as everyone she comes into contact with ends up being brutally killed with a hook. The script is intelligent and always several steps ahead of you, the eerie musical guidance is brilliant and the make-up effects are fantastically gruesome. Tony Todd is ideally cast as the bogeyman, with his strong posture and &#150; above all &#150; incredibly frightening voice. The legend behind his character is staggering and it's beautiful to see how director Rose plays with the realism and surrealism of Barker's basic idea. Not many horror films of the 90's decade come with my highest possible recommendation, but this one definitely does. And don't forget, the Candyman CAN&#133;rip you to pieces!

Though, there is one legend which gets her attention and leads her to rundown housing block where the residents believe that the murders that took place there were done by the hook-handed serial killer The Candyman (Tony Todd). A mysterious figure that can be summoned by repeating his name five times while looking in the mirror. Which Helen does and now her life turns into horrifying nightmare, which teeters between reality and myth, as she gets closer to the truth about the Candyman.Second time around and this memorable piece hasn't lost any of its effect. It's not only a incredibly brood horror film that manages to create an creeping/ingenious plot with such an unsettling physiological tone, but also providing some generally horrific shocks that creep up on you and aren't for the squeamish. So, it's far from your normal slasher and it just doesn't concentrate on the violence for a change. Not only does the plot build on this mystical legend constructively, but also there's also some solid social commentary on the mindset towards race and sex, which added more to this cleverly layered plot (or should I say tragic love story). What is so great about the screenplay is that you yourself feel apprehensive to what's happening to the protagonist and to where this story is heading by playing on what people believe and how these believes can overcome them. Plus it makes great use of the Chicago's gloomy surroundings. Not only does the film have substance, but also style to boot. The direction by Bernard Rose is quite brilliant, with Rose superbly mixing visuals that gel myth and reality superbly. Particularly the well-crafted encounters between Helen and the Candyman - these sequences were incredibly hair-raising. He creates such a glum and dark atmosphere within these rundown buildings filled with vibrant artwork, the richly layered aura goes hand-to-hand with the moody legend. The slow pacing of the film is perfect; there are no tedious blotches because you are totally wrapped in the story and by the delightful performances. The death toll isn't big, but there are some real gruesome deaths, with A LOT blood. The make-up and special effects are extremely thoughtful and inventive. Phillip Glass' extremely effective score deserves such high praise. Soothing, but also haunting and was incredibly effective towards building towards such an almighty blow. Another bonus was the smooth as silk camera-work; it captured the balanced layout of Chicago with plenty of stunning Ariel shots (great intro). Overall, I was just amazed by this beautifully planned production.What a horror icon! Tony Todd totally nails down such a terrifying and profound performance as the mythical being The Candyman. I believe this horror character totally wipes the floor clean of the other icons of its genre and who created him? No other than from the dark mind of Clive Baker (Hellraiser), who brings this frightening thriller alive, which is basically based on Baker's short story - The Forbidden. He came up with a unique horror character that's downright unnerving, completely authentic and has a lot of depth. But Tony Todd's towering figure and eerie voice has a lot to owe to that and to make one tremble in his presence! Virginia Madsen gives a stellar performance as Helen Lyle, who we really do care for her and feel what she is feeling. Good supporting roles from Xander Berkley as Helen's Husband, Kasi Lemmons as her friend/student who's also working with her their thesis and Vanessa Williams as Anne-Marie McCoy who lives in the rundown estate. The dialogue was packed with depth, but also laced with interesting topics and Todd's lines were pretty much poetic and smooth.The one and only small negative would be the ending for me. I was somewhat let down by the second ending and I thought maybe it could've done without it. It just felt tact on. Anyhow it didn't stop it from being damn right creepy and it does pack a real unsteadiness.To get in the mood of it, I say it's definitely a film to watch late at night&#x85; alone.One of the clever horror films (if not the best) of that disappointing decade they call the '90s for horror films. If you're looking for a serious horror (before Scream's imitators made a mockery of the slasher sub-genre), I highly recommend this provocative slasher that doesn't cop out the audience.

Little known Bernard Rose directed this terrifying horror/suspense/thriller set and filmed in Chicago. The story is adapted from a novel by horror master Clive Barker. Two attractive female graduate students research an urban myth only to discover it may not be a myth, or is it? That's the premise of this tightly written and directed film, which does for looking into mirrors what Psycho did for taking showers. This is a thinking man's horror film that scares the daylights out of you at times while still leading you to think beyond what's on the screen.It's much more than just a horror film with a creepy man goring people to death. It exploits many of our deepest fears about society and in ourselves, such as what can happen in a run down public housing complex (Chicago's notorious Cabrini-Green projects), and can our fears remove the certainty of what we know to be untrue? Rose expertly weaves in Hitchcockian themes of being wrongly accused, emotional vulnerability, and psychological exploitation, while maintaining interest and building a high level of tension throughout the film. Philip Glass' quasi-religious score consistently provides an eerie companion when the camera takes us into seemingly normal locations, like a public restroom for instance. Truly one of the very best horror films of the 90's that can disturb your thoughts, penetrate your sense of security, and still provide disturbing gore and violence. This film is not for the faint of heart. Virginia Madsen stars as the main character and doesn't strike a false note. Tony Todd is the candy-man, and he doesn't appear to deliver gumdrops.

As far as scary movies go it falls into a category of its own in terms of its depth and excellenceOne of the main strengths of this movie is that the script and the character performances are so powerful and credible that it doesn't feel the need to inject unnecessary horror/graphic/violent scenes into it to sensationalize it. Sure, there is an extensive amount of blood and gore in the movie but it nevertheless fits in with the plot and isn't added in just to give the film an unnecessary `horror' feel. The chilling and terrifying aspects of this movie come from the dialogue, the sequence of events and the emotions and personas revealed in the characters. The plot and the script is enough to leave you mesmerized throughout the whole movie and to remain on the edge of your seat with the anticipation of what is going to happen next. The producers and scriptwriters must receive top marks for the wonderful way in which they enriched the whole movie by relying on the script and the acting instead of adding cheap gimmicks into it to make it more frightening. In addition to that the lighting and the scenery around the whole movie makes it even more frighteningI have always thought Virginia Madsen to be a highly talented, qualified and excellent actress whose wonderful acting and gifted performances have been consistently overlooked when allocating movie roles. For me `Candyman' confirmed this thesis. Her portrayal of Helen Lyle is truly one of the most excellent portrayals of a character I have seen recently. She gives her character so much depth, dimension and genuine emotions. Tony Todd also emerges from this film as a very talented and wonderful actor. The amount of depth, dimension and persona that he gives to the character of the `Candyman' is amazing. Although the Candyman is in many ways a truly evil and frightening character, you also can't help but feel a great deal of sympathy for him at times and this too is a testament to Todd's acting. The supporting cast &#150;particularly Vanessa Williams and even the young kid who Helen interviews while in the neighbourhood-also deserve an honourable mention for giving their characters such a realistic edge.I would recommend this movie &#150;it is chilling, frightening, intriguing, compelling, sad and wonderful all in one.

Tony Todd is perfect in a menacing performance as the villain and Virginia Madsen makes the perfect victim capturing the right balance between terror and disbelief. The myths and legends behind the film are so complex and so fascinating that this film could have gone on for at least another hour and not be one bit overlong. There is plenty of characterization and atmosphere and the settings for the film are very well chosen.

It sure makes a good premise for a Horror movie and has been done a number of times, though not always successfully.

And I'm sure others have heard stories about alligators in the sewer or the hesitant 911 operator. Indeed, the Candyman and Bloody Mary legends do share some common ground, in that if you chant their names before a mirror x number of times, they'll appear behind you and hack you to pieces.I used to believe in these legends - when I was kid - but as I grew older, I realized that they're just legends and therefore aren't meant to be taken literally. But that's the central dilemma with 1992's Candyman If you believe in something enough, will that belief make fiction reality?The Candyman (Tony Todd) has claimed responsibility for a series of grisly slayings in a particularly rough Chicago housing project, and Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is anxious to discredit the myths. But when she is falsely accused of several brutal murders, could the Candyman be out for revenge, because she doubted him?I'll admit upfront that I'm not familiar with the works of Clive Barker, who is clearly one of the most talented writers of the last 20 years. Only this film and Hellraiser have been able to capture my interest, unfortunately.

I grew up loving films that scared the hell out of me! Candyman is excellent because it is a film that I genuinely found very twisted and disturbing when I saw it at the tender age of 15. Check this out,                 'It is a blessed condition believe me. To be whispered about in street corners...to live in other peoples dreams...but not to have to be...do you understand?'  How cool is that quote! I am going to throw in a few quotes in this review because the writing of this film is really, really cool! The Candyman is not an inarticulate Jason or Michael Myers. He has the vocabulary of a homicidal  drama professor who likes Richard Burton. Candyman is the thinking person's horror film. It explores the notion of the urban myth. The Candyman exists because people tell the stories about him. They spread the myth making him flesh. Unfortunately for researcher Helen Lyle, she doesn't know any of this. She investigates the urban myth of the Candyman, seeking to debunk it and her fate becomes sealed. Hey! Writing a paper isn't worth being burned alive! The film rests on the central idea that fiction can suddenly become real life if enough people believe in the myth. Boogey men can therefore be created if enough people believe in monsters. This theme is familiar to the director Bernard Rose. I recommend another one of his films called 'Paperhouse.' This is about the imagination of a little girl that starts to manifest in reality. It is also quite good although not as scary. The original story of how the Candyman was made is horrific and just deepens the mystery. This is not a film like the Friday the 13th series. This is far more cerebral and relies much more on its concepts.  The Candyman is the whisper in the classroom that will exist forever.  When Helen sets out to debunk the Candyman, this is essentially like trying to murder him. 'Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation. Without them,  I am nothing.' Debunking the Candyman will destroy his immortality. The only way the Candyman can exist is through the shedding of innocent blood so that the stories of him can continue to proliferate. So when Helen decides that the Candyman is actually a local drug dealer hiding behind the Candyman identity. She feels that she has solved the mystery of the mysterious murders that the Candyman has committed.  What Helen does not know is that the Candyman is a kind of a physical manifestation of the Jungian collective unconscious. The Candyman takes his revenge, he feels obliged to come, after all she has caused much doubt about his actual existence. The Candyman tears away Helen's day to day reality. Driving her into what other people think is her own insanity. Now she knows the truth of the Candyman...  The conversations between Helen and the Candyman are haunting. What is also interesting is that sadism and masochism are major features in Clive Barker's work. 'The pain I assure you, will be exquisite.' S&M tendencies! This is one dark and twisted piece of celluloid! The acting is also really good from both actors. The final scene is horrific as Helen tries to rescue a baby in a blazing woodpile and is burnt alive! Helen herself then becomes part of the  legend and therefore comes back as another physical manifestation of legend. However, remember this is not Helen's ghost but a construction of Helen through the beliefs of those who believe this mysterious urban legend. Candyman says it best... 'Your death will be a tale to frighten children...to make lovers cling closer in their rapture. Come with me and be immortal...' Genius. This film also has a great soundtrack, a very haunting score.  Candyman is a very interesting film that originates from the absolutely twisted mind of Clive Barker. This is brilliant, well written horror. 9 out of 10.   By the way avoid the sequels.

Helen becomes obsessed by the legend of the Candyman (Tony Todd), a son of slaves whose father became rich in 1890 after inventing a device for mass producing of shoes. The educated Candyman was an artist, but when the daughter of a powerful man got pregnant of him, her father hired some hooligans that saw off his right hand with a rusty blade, took him to an apiary with dozens of hives with hungry bees, smashed the hives and smeared honeycomb in his naked body. Candyman was stung to death by the bees, than his body was burnt in a giant pyre and the ashes scattered on Cabrini Green. Candyman stays alive in the legend that says that he would appear if his name is spoken five times in front of the mirror, and the skeptical Helen summons Candyman. Helen and Bernadette go to Cabrini Green, where two unsolved murders had happened, and the dwellers blame Candyman for the crimes. Helen's disbelief brings Candyman back; the dog of Cabrini Green's dweller Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Williams) is slashed and her baby vanishes, and Helen is blamed. Later Candyman kills her friend Bernadette, and Helen is accused of first degree murder and arrested, while she unsuccessfully tries to prove that Candyman is the real killer.Candyman is a gore and well-developed horror movie with a character visibly inspired in the urban legend of Bloody Mary. The screenplay sustains the ambiguity of Helen's sanity, and it is never clear if Candyman does really exist or the murders are committed by the disturbed and impressed Helen. Virginia Madsen is excellent in her performance of a woman in the edge of insanity and Tony Todd is amazing with his strong and dark voice. The great music score of Philip Glass fits perfectly to the movie and is another plus.

It is a rarity in its genre, for it goes deeper than the standard formula horror movie, presenting a story under a story.  While it contains plenty of frightening shocks and gore, that is only the suurface level, and the focus for watching it the first time.  After the first time, pay careful attention to the dialogue and the interactions between Helen and the Candyman.  The Candyman is not what he first appears to be.<SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON...STOP HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!>The biggest complaints I usually hear about this movie are of plot holes. People often ask, Why does the Candyman haunt the black population instead of the descendents of those who killed him? or, Why does the hook make Helen come back when it is not what made Candyman come back? or other similar questions.  These are valid questions about the ghost story concerning Daniel Robetei, but they entirely miss the point of the movie. That point is that the incarnation we see of Candyman in the movie is NOT the ghost of Daniel Robetei.  Forget what the pointless sequels lead you to believe, for in the first movie, as well as the original story The Forbidden by Clive Barker, the Candyman is an incarnation of the faith of those who tell stories about him.  There is no ghost of Daniel Robetei, but rather an entity that is formed by rumor, faith, fear, and the story itself. It seems to me that almost everyone misses this point, but it is there, clear as day, if you listen closely to the dialogue.  Of course, reading the original story helps shed a little light on this as well, and it can be found in Clive Barker's In the Flesh, a collection of short stories. So, Candyman haunts the black population because they are the ones who tell the stories and believe in him.  He is constantly asking Helen to be his witness in order to strengthen their belief, and his offer to her to live forever is literal.  If she does become his witness, she will become a part of the story, and a part of the creative force that allows Candyman to exist.  In the end, Helen returns because the population of Cabrini Green makes her a part of the story.I hope this sheds a little light on the story for those of you stuck on the plot holes.  This really is a fantastic, original story that is much more complex than that of any other horror movie I have seen.  Not to mention that the performances are fantastic.  Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen have a fantastic chemistry that is very convincing.  The only gripe I have about this movie is the p***-poor actress they picked for Helen's husband's girlfriend. So, watch it first for the shocks, but watch it again for the deeper story buried within.Definately a perfect 10/10.

I knew it was a cult classic horror film, but I had no idea it was going to be so good! The story here is a very intriguing and, in my opinion, amazing mix of social abjection. The abject is defined as that which transcends boundaries, and in this case a very clear boundary is drawn between urban white and black neighborhoods by a freeway, but their interaction is broken through the very boundary between reality and the supernatural. A woman investigating urban legends comes across a local superstitious belief in Candyman, an Emancipation era black man who broke the social rules of the time by falling in love with a white woman, thus honeyed to be stung to death by bees and burned to ash. A century later the Candyman wreaks vengeance upon society by being called five times from a mirror, and that legend is used generally to keep the local kids in urban-area Illinois to respect the undercurrent of racism contained in those communities. Well this woman goes and forces her way into the black neighborhood shortly after breaking the rules and calling Candyman, and since her skepticism and general outreach has people engaging with her and her studies of urban legend, the Candyman finally appears and demands the blood of innocents to continue the power of fear and vengeance--while also forcing the woman to join in his quest for spilled blood. And it only gets more delightful from there.This movie is by no means perfect, but the sheer sincerity of its message and audacity of its style stands it head and shoulders over more dramatic movies of the same theme and horror movies with pretense towards such social engagement. Some of the characters are, indeed, stereotypical, but mostly they're well-written enough to illicit some form of sympathy all around. The Candyman's dialog is absolutely ridiculous, but it's easy to ignore when his relationship to both the world and the woman is so very clear. And this is a Clive Barker idea, which means blood, feces, and insects have to literally saturate the walls, which is both incredibly effective and randomly kitsch. Heck, it's not even really clear how the whole baby being killed but actually being alive thing works, but you know what? I'm not complaining, this movie is pure 100% enjoyable with a clear social statement. That's harder to pull off than it seems, and many directors try and in the very act of trying try to hard, but this movie is very clear the limits of its statements and its storyline, and keeps things structured tight and clean.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"First ask, then kill.","Date":"2 May 2008","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Policewoman Lift up your left breast...

The movie tells us that one needs to say Candyman five times in order for him to appear, and yet he materializes almost at random, whenever he feels like it. Why does he ask Madsen whether or not she wants to be his victim? He doesn't seem to ask the others that. Besides, since when do blood-happy ghosts ask permission before cutting someone up like a German sausage? Freddy Krueger may be an idiotic horror-film character, but at least Craven never made his main character ask if it's okay to kill before slashing his victims.As for Madsen getting the perennial Hitchcockian blame for committing a murder, surely the police pathologist would be able to conlude that Madsen's black girlfriend was not killed by the knife found in Madsen's hand, but by a hook which Madsen didn't have anywhere in her apartment?If Madsen is supposed to be an intelligent investigator, then why would she summon Candyman by calling out his name in the shrink's office? Surely she'd know that this spells the shrink's doom? That, in turn, made her look even more like the serial-killer that she wasn't.The way Candyman is killed (there ARE sequels) is silly Madsen reaches out for a piece of a chair or something that's on fire, and that's it bye-bye killer. What, Candyman wasn't able to simply disappear as he had always done? Fly away? Overall, not a bad film, but not particularly well thought-out, and far too uneventful in the first half. Visually mediocre, too.

Further research leads Helen to Cabrini Green, a frightening ghetto project where everyone not only knows about Candyman but believe in him, and fear him. Helen does not believe in the legend of Candyman, until Candyman comes looking for her. When Bernie is brutally murdered and a baby goes missing from the projects, Helen is arrested, having been found at the scene of both crimes, covered in blood and wielding a weapon. No one believes her claims, that it was Candyman who committed the crimes. But Candyman offers her a bargain her life in exchange for the baby's, who is still alive. Cruelly abandoned by her cheating jerk of a husband and pursued by the police, Helen returns to the projects for a final showdown with Candyman.Based on Clive Barker's short story The Forbidden, Candyman is a combination of the Bloody Mary legend, the Guy Fawkes celebration and The Phantom of the Opera. Virginia Madsen as Helen is beautiful and tragic and also damn scary when she wants to be. Tony Todd as Candyman is both horrific and tragic, evoking true, dark, Gothic horror whenever he appears on the screen. This is a stunningly original film, heavy with dread and never once going in for cheap scares. The acting is flawless, the musical score is creepy as hell, filled with ghostly organ music which sets just the right tone of sadness and fear. The setting of Cabrini Green is frighteningly convincing - it's a scary enough place without Candyman, filled with hopelessness and the constant threat of death. The violence is brutal and bloody, so be warned.This is not your typical teenage slasher film. Anyone with an appreciation for urban myths and legends, and for Clive Barker's excellent morbid imagination should not miss this film. It is a genuinely dark, moving tale of love, blood and horror, boasting realistic, three-dimensional characters instead of the usual one dimensional meat puppets for the horror grinder. See it at least once!

Not even looking in a mirror but I don't dare finish the phrase. I can see my reflection in the computer screen. Maybe that counts, I don't know. No hook so far, I'm safe.Most of you will be thinking that this film will be typical. Looking back at it now, from the teens to the nineties you will be thinking another typical Nightmare On Elm Street or Friday the 13th that will be remade very shortly as a Hollywood slasher flick. I have to say on first impression of this film, this was not the case.The first forty minutes follow Helen (Madsen), a student researching for her thesis on urban horror. To accompany her on her project is her best friend Bernadette (Lemmons), who unwittingly helps Helen delve deep into the theories behind one of the great legends, that of the 'Candyman.' Say his name five times and he'll cut you with his hook of a hand. They interview people from a rundown council estate, a place where a while back a girl was murdered after stating Candyman's name five times into the mirror. Her body was then sliced open from groin to gullet. The residents believe it has some mystic reason but Helen just shrugs it off and researches the building without any care. She finds, hidden away behind the mirror a secret lair, which has signs of life to it. Intrigued by this she goes in taking photos. Photos she believes will help her ace her project. Bernadette on the other hand is more interested in their safety.Helen gets rid of the shackle that is Bernadette and continues her research alone but comes unstuck when she meets 'Candyman' himself. A leader of the local gang who uses a hook to hurt people. She is attacked but not killed and then helps the police in capturing this man.Up to this point the film is good and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I was enjoying it. No silly teen girl doing things out of the ordinary, no shoddy acting to match the dreadful script. As a matter of fact the acting and script were pretty good. There is also believable reason as to why Helen pursues her interest alone. An untrustworthy husband and a desire to achieve greatness.I'm afraid after here though the film takes a huge dive. For starters the Candyman is finally introduced, the spirit of a slave who had his hand sawn off, his body smothered in honey to attract deadly bees and burnt on a fire, and that is the problem from there. He was much more believable when he wasn't seen. People say they thought Todd was excellent as the Candyman but I just found the whole role lame. The film had real potential up until we finally see him, standing like he has a rod up his arse in a parking garage. From there we see him hypnotize Helen into murdering the next load of victims and being arrested for it. Causing her to drop her obsession with the case and instead be an object of Candyman's desires.I won't tell you too much more as it may ruin a film many horror fans will love, I'm just a little disappointed that a film that started off so well ended so poorly. Madsen is brilliant in her role and takes the useless female actor cliché away from the horror franchise, well at least from this film anyway, and the score is intensely creepy although there is only so much organ playing I can take. Also many of the tracking shots giving you the sense that someone is watching you are great. It's just an absolute shame this film took a dive as it could have been something a hell of a lot better.

The movie is about Helen Lyle, a woman who is investigating urban legends and mythology. While doing research, she comes across the tale of the Candyman, an African-American artist who had his arm sawed off, and was attacked by a swarm of bees hundreds of years ago after having an affair with a white woman. Supposedly, if you say Candyman in the mirror five times, the Candyman will appear to you, with his big hook-hand, and brutally murder you. While investigating unsolved murders within the city that are suspected to be caused by the Candyman, Helen herself becomes entangled in the legend, and the Candyman begins appearing to her. Soon, Helen's life goes into a downward spiral as she is accused of murder, while the Candyman tries to make her one of his new victims.Clive Barker must have a pretty good imagination, because this is quite a unique horror story. I don't think I've ever heard of a story like this, so the movie is definitely original. The plot is woven very neatly, with plenty of scary moments and artistic touches, making it a beautiful horror film. Virginia Madsen was excellent and convincing in this movie, the audience really sympathizes with her as her life is turned upside down by the Candyman, and in the end, she still turns out to be a hero. Tony Todd was seriously scary in his role of the Candyman himself, with his creepy stare and his low-key voice. There are some genuinely gruesome death scenes in this movie, and the sequences where the Candyman appears to Helen were extremely well-done and scary. Tony Todd was the perfect Candyman, his dead-serious facial expressions and low, menacing voice adds to the overall creepy effect of his character. The film takes place in the inner-city area of Chicago, and the film includes undertones of racial issues that play in well with the setting and the characters in the movie, without going over-the-top. The music in this film is one of the most memorable things about it though. It's an eerie, haunting score that is used in the scenes very appropriately and makes things much more unsettling and spooky, as if things aren't creepy enough.Overall, Candyman is a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. It's imaginative, it's morbid, it's artistic, and it's an all around good horror movie. If you are a fan of scary films or have the slightest interest in the genre, I highly recommend this. Candyman is undoubtedly one of the best horror films of the decade. 10/10.

This is brilliantly set against mirrored worlds in Chicago, Virginia Madsen's character's posh upscale condo and its twin, the project Cabrini Green.  There is much going on within this film, beyond just the surface tale of horror, as there is in any good horror film. It's a morality play, a story about how we deal, or rather don't deal, with race relations, and a really beautifully twisted love story as well, as all of Barker's works are.If you've never had a chance to see this wonderful film, please give it a chance.  Tony Todd's voice will tingle your spine, there's enough gore for slasher film addicts to keep interested, but don't let that blind you to the smart, elegantly crafted story underneath.

This is what true horror is all about. Candyman is extremely suspenseful and intensely creepy, in fact just writing about it I can already feel the hairs on my arms standing up again. It's that affecting!Virginia Madsen is superbly cast as Helen, a flawed but likable heroine the audience cares deeply about. Her journey into madness is one that we empathize with every brutal step of the way. You don't want bad things to happen to her because you've fallen in love with her. How Madsen wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance is still beyond me.Tony Todd is also an antihero with a personality and a rich one at that. The film is violent but the gore never becomes comedic. It sets the perfect tone of brutality.Candyman cannot come more highly recommended.

As much as I love films of all types, it takes something particularly memorable to get the coveted 10 stars. Candyman is one of those films that manages the impossible.It's clever in that we see an atypical setting, the urban streets, the high towers, the estates. It looks grim and feels it. Then we get into the arc of the story and everything changes to a degree.Yes the places shown remain the same but the story of the Candyman is enough to keep us transfixed, add to that some strong performances and it's a world we've never seen before. Even more powerful for the fact that the essential story itself derives partially from the urban legend of Bloody Mary.Plot Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a graduate student who is conducting research for her own thesis on Urban Legends. Neither her nor her friend believing the story of the Candyman decide to jokingly say his name 5 times in Helen's mirror. Nothing happens. Yet soon after things go wrong and Helen realises some urban legends are anything but.Of the strongest abilities that this film possesses in heaps is the acting. From Xander Berkeley to Madsen and finally to Todd, the acting is of the highest quality and no one feels pushed into the shadows throughout this film.Yet it is primarily Madsen and Todd who stand out. Madsen was an actress I never really took much notice of until this film. She stands firm as the sole heroine trying to deal with the trauma and not buckling under the horror of it all.She carries that wonderful line between innocence and sharpness. Never too harsh, never too vanilla. She manages to be a great combination of both and come out fighting against the Candyman. It's hard not to love her in this role and furthermore not to love the scene at the end with the fire. It's heartbreaking for a multitude of reasons and why I adore her in this role.And then there was Tony Todd.The man, as we know, oozes charisma. He's recognisable for that voice alone but people have a tendency to forget he is not just that, he is also an actor of great skill. Able to take the simplest scene, just one line and instantly make it his own. When we first see him in the aforementioned role he does not disappoint. It's an eerie mixture of Gothic meets horror with that dash of elegance as he manages to make a monster who actually is compassionate and who we don't initially hate.He is the Candyman.The special effects. I heard a lot of negative on this and I'm not sure why if I am honest. If you watch this for the effects alone you miss the point of the film as they prove only part of the cog. For that matter though I thought they were done with grace and looked beautiful against the bland background. In a world where grey seems the prominent colour, the blood sticks out with the richness of its colour. To do it in such a setting was a clever little nod and adds to the overall tone of the film.Personally I liked Bernard Rose's score. It's charming and creepy without being ostentatious and those glassy moments really do send chills. Where the score reaches heights is when it begins seeping in just before the Candyman turns up. With the lights down, the darkness wrapping you and nothing but your imagination it leads your mind into a very twisted place.It's how Gothic horror should be. Not too much emphasis is placed on the special FX alone, a staple in most horror films, instead care is given to the characters and where they will go as the film draws on. It doesn't play it safe which I respect instead going for the jugular.And despite the ending being something we have seen before it doesn't suffer in the premise of the film. If anything the final scene adds another jolt to the scares born into this film.My only minor complaint is when Helen finds her other half setting up home with a new girlfriend after she was confined to the hospital. Not upsetting for him, despite Berkeley's obnoxious character, yet rather because you truly feel for the character of Helen. After everything she has endured you'd think there'd be some small hope on the horizon but it doesn't happen. Everything bad happens and yes it culminates in one of the most tragic scenes in Candyman.However that complaint could as much be a plus since you realise the depth of the acting and how she pulls you in, that itself is no small feat.And this is why Candyman is my baby. For every horror movie that ever has been, ever will be, this is my love. It encompasses the morals and fabrics of society into one and takes our preconceptions, throwing them away. Candyman is a wonderful horror film that deserves more recognition and I hope it gets it.I urge everyone to see this and embrace the beauty of Candyman. Lest you say his name and he comes for you...

According to the legend, if you stand in front of a mirror and say out his name five times, he will appear behind you and kill you. When Helen decides to go deeper into the stories behind Candyman, murders start occurring around her.The story can best be described as a psychological thriller. Throughout most of the movie, you wonder if all the things that are happening are actually just going on in Helen's mind. But the build-up and setting are more of a fantasy/drama/tragedy style than thriller style. It is really dark, but the music adds a mystical kind of beauty to it. In that sense, I also really enjoyed the ending.The music is an important part of this movie. The composer is Philip Glass, who has won a number of awards for his music, and who wrote the music to Kundun and The Hours, among other things. The music in Candyman is a beautiful piece of classical-style work which makes this movie more fantasy-style than horror.I can't say much more concrete about Candyman without giving anything away, but I recommend this to anyone who is slightly interested in horror-movies. The reason I gave it an 8 instead of a 10 is that I don't believe it appeals to people who neither enjoy fantasy nor horror. People who only enjoy Gandhi and The Mission won't like Candyman at all, for instance. But people who are slightly interested in fantasy or horror will enjoy this one.

Her research leads her to the run down Cabrini Green housing project, in a bad part of the neighbourhood, where several recent murders have been accredited to the monster. After Helen is attacked by a man claiming to be him, in a filthy washroom, she is able to finger the culprit out, who turns out to be a Candyman imitator, responsible for the vicious murders that took place there. Helen should be able to relax & continue her research in peace, that is until one day while in an underground parking lot, she is visited by the very real Candyman! after she foolishly called his name five times as a joke while staring in a mirror a few days prior, asking her to join him, Candyman then cuts a swath of blood through all of Helen's friends & others who have come into contact with her, framing her for the heinous crimes. With Helen's world turned upside down by this demon, she attempts to clear her name, free herself from his grasp & hopefully lay this evil entity to rest once & for all.In what is best described as 1992's other tortured soul film (the other being Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)) Based on the wonderfully chilling short story The Forbidden penned by horror author CLIVE BARKER, CANDYMAN delivers everything a horror fan would want in a really good horror movie, it's cerebral & utterly effective nail shredding horror thriller & a breath of fresh air during the horror movie draught from 1989-1996. Critics claimed Dracula was 1992's scariest movie, but they were wrong, for that honour most assuredly belongs to CANDYMAN. The film is very well directed by BERNARD ROSE, who knows how to keep his audience on the edge of their seats & executes the scares with such skill, it will give even the strongest of wills a jolt. The film unlike the vast majority of the horror films released during the era, thankfully never skimps on the gory goodies, as a series of violent, disturbing kills are pulled off with such brutality, that even the off screen kills & the aftermath of those victims is able to give us a very vivid mental image of how the murders were pulled off. The Candyman himself at one point when confronting the heroine, opens his jacket to reveal his disgusting bee filled rib cage in a well executed special effects moment & speaking of the Candyman, TONY TODD is downright perfection as the villainous monster, his voice is perfect for evoking dread in his audience, his presence dominates every frame that he's in, in fact I think it's fair to say that had another actor been chosen for his part, CANDYMAN would have been nowhere near as successful, if successful at all without him. The rest of the acting is so good one can't say enough good things about it. The film is very atmospheric & creepy, even during the daylight scenes & the orchestral score by composer PHILLIP GLASS is one of the best horror soundtrack to ever grace a horror film. The film oddly enough even tackles the subject of racial discrimination, as Madsen reveals that after her attack, the entire section of the neighbourhood was shut down, in an effort to locate her attacker, while the murder of a couple of dark people prior to that, was pretty much overlooked. The villain of the piece doesn't actually show up until the 45 minute mark in the movie, while that would normally be tantamount to suicide for a horror film, to keep it's title character off camera for that long, the truth is, the film's story is so engrossing that not only do you really not recognize it until the villain finally shows up, but the film makes you think you have seen him a lot in those forty five minutes, when you never did, that's what I love so much about this movie, that's how powerful it's story actually is!That said I will say that while the film is a near perfect horror thriller, there were a few things that bugged me that the film-makers never bothered answering like, why is Candyman so enthralled with Helen? why does he take as long as he does, to come to her a few days after she called him, instead of just appearing to her automatically, like he did all the others? How is he able to materialize in the parking lot without a mirror in sight? How does the kidnapped baby he takes, survive this ordeal?Oddly despite positive word of mouth from fans & critics & a successful financial run at the box office, the film oddly failed to re-ignite interest in the horror genre. The ending unnecessarily leaves a set up for a sequel, (which came three years later), with the final image of Helen, recently buried, returning to kill her cheating husband, after he utters her name four times, while staring into a mirror (a sequence that does not turn up in Barker's short story) while I loved the scene & thought it was effectively creepy, I'm glad the sequels ignored going down this route with the Helen Lyle character.All in all, if you're looking for a really scary & effective thriller & have not seen this one yet, do yourself a favour & hunt down a copy of this movie now! you will not be disappointed, CANDYMAN is a real, true, pure blooded horror film.

He's got a hook were his right hand used to be. His name Candyman.         The story of Candyman goes back 100 years. Candyman was the son of a slave. He had a girlfriend and got her pregnant, making the girl's father furious. He paid a group of brutal hooligans to chase Candyman down, saw off his right hand, then pour honey all over him and had 100 bees sting him to death, next they burned him and scattered his ashes all over Cabrini Green, which today is a housing project. Helen and her friend Bernadette venture over there one day to investigate the Candyman theory because a woman was once brutally murdered in an apartment. Helen takes many photographs of the apartment and the two meet a tenant, Ann Marie, who had a baby boy named Anthony; Helen later returned and learned another story possibly involving Candyman in which a little boy was brutally, BRUTALLY murdered in a bathroom. When investigating the latreen, a gang member came in and hit her with a hook. So that apparently solved the case committing murders using Candyman as a cover-up. But they were wrong! The real Candyman met with Helen and the next thing she knew, she woke up in Ann Marie's apartment in a pool of blood. The dog was decapatated and the baby was missing! Helen was arrested and blamed for the crime. Her husband, Trevor, came and got her and all the while, Helen suspected her husband was having an affair. And he was.          Candyman confronted Helen again. He gutted Bernadette like a fish and Helen was arrested and committed. Before long, Helen was alone with no one to turn to. She turned herself over to Candyman. She even saved baby Anthony from a huge bonfire and sadly didn't survive afterwards. Trevor was very sad over Helen's death and decided saying her name five times in the mirror would bring her back.

Rather than a demon from hell, the antagonist of this tale is an urban legend going by the name of Candyman. The mythology behind the story is one of the film's major plus points, and director Bernard Rose does a good job of building it. The mythology combined with what can only be described as a fetid atmosphere bode well together, and ensures that this film is both a creepy and absorbing tale of horror. The film follows a pair of University students; Helen Lyle and Bernadette Walsh doing a thesis on urban legends. They decide to research the modern day myth of 'Candyman', a figure who appears complete with a hooked hand to savage whomever stupid enough to say his name five times in front of the mirror. However, one of the duo starts to put a bit too much effort into the work, and ends up coming a cropper when Candyman decides to have his wicked way with her.The parts of the story that stand out the most are the relationship between the protagonist and Candyman, and the idea of a community of people believing in title character. However, this is where the film falls down to me. The scenes between Helen and Candyman put too much focus on the 'evil' dialogue, and the relationship is never really built upon. The urban legend theme is often touched upon, but we only meet a handful of characters that believe in the almighty Candyman, and they aren't in the film for long. The basis of the story follows Helen's bid for sanity, and while this provides an interesting backbone for the film - I really do think it could have been a lot better. The casting is largely good, with Tony Todd putting across an effective portrayal of Candyman, and Virginia Madsen delivering a believable performance as the film's victim. Xander Berkeley, who came to fame recently with a role in the first two series' of 24 rounds off the cast, which is under the direction of Bernard Rose. The only other film I've seen from him is Paperhouse, and Candyman is certainly a lot better than that. Although that isn't exactly difficult. Overall, this is a creepy and interesting film; but I can't say I'm a huge fan of it.

Seeing this again I was so floored by his work that I'd put it just behind Psycho and Halloween as far as the champion horror movie music "},{"Title":"''Be My Victim''","Date":"1 April 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Candyman was one of the finest horror films I have ever seen and one of my personal favorites. Writer-director Bernard Rose does an excellent job of adapting a Barker story into a masterpiece film that not only provides chills and scares, but also many issues of racism and vengeance. Everything from the sound to story pacing is tight and extremely effective, and I have to agree with what someone else here said Philip Glass' score is so subtle and creepy, it's perfect! The plot of Candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force (the Cabrini Green Housing Projects in Chicago, which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the Candyman, a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times. She is convinced, as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be, that the Candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence. The fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the Candyman reinforces this conviction... However, midway through the film, there is a decisive rupture, and everything in Madsen's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate. The chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from. Soon, everything we have come to know about the young woman we've been following, all of the connections she has to her friends, to her husband, to humanity in general seem to be undone. It would be unfair to describe exactly what happens, but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of Candyman are as frightening as anything I've seen on film.Candyman is a well written thriller. It's overabundance of gore overshadows the existential elements. All the actors perform their parts with aplomb. Virginia Madsen is more than believable as a woman on the edge of a breakdown, while Tony Todd was born to play the Candyman. His tall and imposing stature combined with a deep and creepy voice can be truly unnerving at times. In a word, if you're a horror fan don't hesitate in getting this cult classic. Candyman really is prime-quality stuff! Overall rating 8 out of 10.

It is an atmospheric art film, with hooks rending flesh and pools of blood. Everything is several steps above the normal level of a Slasher (except humor, which is completely lacking&#x97;this work takes itself very seriously), particularly the acting. Madsen creates a completely believable heroine, a bit naive and weak at the beginning, trapped but stronger at the end. Todd is a standout, with his deep, fluid voice and commanding, somewhat lost expressions. When he extols the virtues of painful death, it is almost believable. The complex screenplay, based on a Clive Barker story, left me with plenty to think about and more to feel, particularly about race relations in modern culture. If you're not interested in thinking, Candyman will still entertain with plenty of gore and scares. It did frighten me, but I'm not entirely comfortable reciting Candyman, five times.

I didn't pay attention to the deep meaning and pure genius of it. In my child mind all I knew was that Candyman was the big bad Boogeyman and he'll kill you if you say his name in the mirror enough times. I didn't pay attention to the story within at all. So as I grew up I began to develop a special fondness for Horror movies. In particular, Good Horror movies. It is still my favorite genre. So of course I stumbled across the name Clive Barker. His original Hellraiser movie, which was based on his own novel was for a time my favorite of his. The franchise of sequels that followed were either hit or mega miss. But I then began looking for any Clive Barker related movies. His other two directed movie Nightbreed and Lord Of Illusions were good but still paled in comparison to the icon of Hellraiser. Midnight Meat Train was good but again it couldn't hold a candle to the big H. Then came Candyman. I remembered my childhood thoughts of the film and just kinda skipped on it thinking it was just too gimicky. But for some reason I couldn't resist the urge to rediscover the movie knowing I hadn't seen it since I was a naive kid. So I read reviews everywhere online for the movie. Nearly everyone was praising it. Some calling it the best horror movie of the 90s. The itch needed to be scratched so I went out and purchased the Candyman DVD. It was a good horror movie night that night.The movie is set in the 90s but feels so timeless. Well except for the lack of cell phones everywhere. Needless to say the situations in the film are so disturbing and surreal yet very realistic believe it or not. The setting for some parts of the movie in Cabrini Green, which was one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the US back in the day, was so eerie. Unlike many horror throwaways the characters are likable and seeing them die is tragic and disturbing. Virginia Madsen is a beautiful and lovable woman. Her portrayal of the main character was so helpless. This also is one of the few horror movies where the characters don't make constant stupid decisions throughout just for the sake of keeping the horror going. You know what I mean, like when a character hears a strange noise and walks through a house calling out to the possible death threat and sometimes with no lights on. Those stupid decisions are non-existent here. This movie takes place in realistic scenarios. Sure you might be thinking 'how could a ghost coming out of a mirror to kill you be realistic?'. Well here's a fun part. Though some may disagree, I think the Candyman never really entered the physical realm in the movie. (Spoiler) From the moment the Candyman makes his first on screen appearance on is when the main character has entered her psychological doom. No one but Helen (Madsen) really sees the Candyman throughout the film. It's a scary possibility to think of the movie that way. (End Spoiler/theory) Speaking of Candyman himself, Tony Todd gives an iconic portrayal of one of the all time horror villains. His voice sounds like evil incarnate. It fills the room even if you watch the movie at a low volume. Some of his scenes are so trippy that even the viewer wonders if what they saw really happened. It's very dreamlike and of course very nightmarishly surreal. The musical score is one of the greatest of any genre. I'd even say the main theme is better than that of horror mainstays like Halloween and The Exorcist. The first half of the movie does a great job of building up tension without ever getting boring. The second half is just relentless in it's terror. Don't think this is a mindless madman gone wild horror movie. This is a movie that will haunt you if you really pay attention and preferably watch it loud in the dark and maybe with a group.So this is not only my favorite Clive Barker related movie, but probably my new favorite Horror movie. The night I bought the DVD as an adult I had hallucinations of Candyman as I tried to sleep. That NEVER happens to me. It was disturbing. But did it stop me from watching it again? No. This movie has such great replay value and it seriously gets scarier and more haunting with each viewing even though you know what's going to happen.

Interesting, considering that on paper the idea is more in the vein of shocker and gory slasher stuff, which is the last thing that scares me, movie wise. Threason this one triumphs over so many atmosphere. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the most important thing in a horror flick is atmosphere. This one jumps at you with an ambient, dilapidated, forgotten ghetto aura that stays with you. It takes place is Chicago's sketchy Cabrini Green, a run down project and breeding ground for filth, poverty and despair. An urban legend circulates about the Candyman, a tortured slave who returned from the dead with a hook hand to wreak havoc, brought about by saying his name 5 times while looking into a mirror. Virginia Madsen plays a determined woman who investigates this, much to her dismay. Tony Todd is a velvet voiced, imposing, terrifying gentleman as Daniel Robitaille, the ghost of the former slave, and the titular Candyman. He bites into his role with a malevolent grace and all knowing mirth that jumps out of the screen at you, creating a horror legend and archetype that would carry on for two vastly inferior but interesting sequels. Like I said, few horror films can really frighten me, but this one has that magical eerie spark that's so hard to capture, but does the trick, causing you to leave the lights on in bed after watching it.

The middle of the movie slows down a little bit, but leads to a relatively interesting and exciting end. It definitely has it's share of moments that'll make you jump, but they are mostly based off of cheaper gimmicks such as sudden loud noises that coincide with a quick scene change or appearance. It probably won't keep you up at night, but it is worth a watch, even 23 years after it's release date. For entertainment value I'd say it still holds up.

Never judge a book by its cover because I had this movie pegged as a slasher flick and was totally wrong.While it does have elements of a slasher movie, Candyman works on an entirely different spectrum, the psyche. If you had to find a somewhat similar villain to the Candyman, you would be safe comparing him to Freddy Krueger; Both operate on a thin line between the physical and the ethereal realms. The Candyman isn't merely there to say boo and scare you, he haunts you, he ruins your life, and he causes you to go insane! Helen, the woman we follow throughout the film pulls a classic horror movie faux pas and continues to stick her beak into some seriously spooky stuff. She ventures into the hood, breaks into the Candyman's slaughter house, and worst of all...says Candyman five times...Instead of killing her on the spot, the Candyman takes a particular liking to her (he imagines her as a past girlfriend), in an odd case of love he starts to kill everyone she cares about and because he is a phantom, an urban legend, Helen is blamed for the murders. Long story short, it doesn't take Helen that long to go insane and be institutionalized... I won't spoil the ending, but it's pretty spooky. Tony Todd is INCREDIBLY creepy as Candyman. His deep voice and menacing grin will haunt you the night you watch the movie, if not longer. He doesn't appear too often, but when he does, he leaves a lasting impression. The setting in this film is superb. The urban setting provides a stark contrast from the ivy league college where the movie starts. Almost more haunting than the Candyman are the graffiti laden and abandoned projects he inhabits. Excellent cinematography help bring out the best of the setting. Definitely an artistic achievement!The reason I couldn't rate this movie higher is because it suffers from 90's cheesiness. Some scenes that seemed gruesome or disturbing at the time just look over-done, laughably bad, or just seem irrelevant with all the different stuff that's been done over the years. This movie would be a GREAT candidate in my opinion for a remake, and I would pay full admission price to see it. Loved the original, but I think it would GREATLY benefit from a makeover, so to speak... So I dare you...after you watch the movie, look in the mirror and say, Candyman 5 times!

One of these methods is that this gets the beginning of the film right, where it set up characters, introduces the villain and then go from there. There's plenty of suspense as the story about the Candyman is slowly unraveled piece-by-piece as one clue asks a question that another one answers, which leads to another question until the full history is perfectly explained. A lot of that is due to his being one of the more gruesome back histories in horror cinema, as the story is very original and induces plenty of chills throughout. We do get plenty of great jumps here, including classic gags as the person leaping out of the darkness to attack someone or the sight of the Candyman's hook-hand bursting forth from a mirror. Granted, there are others, but these two are some favorites that do make you jump. The frequent use of bees in the movie is also a great scare tactic, as this not only manages to tie it in effectively against the back-story but also utilizes a creature that many people are afraid of and the sight of them crawling from open wounds or from people's mouth makes you squirm as you sit and watch which is just utterly effective and enjoyable. Even the special effects used are great, as the final look of the Candyman is very well done and pretty graphic with an incredible aura of menace surrounding him, and the mystery is creative, imaginative, and pretty spooky. Tony Todd is perfectly cast in the role, as his brooding voice and intense presence make him the Candyman personified, making for one of the creepiest villains in horror history. He is one of the few types of slasher villains that loves to hack up his victims and produce as much blood as he can during the process. When he is unleashed and goes in his spree, it ignites a fire in the film with lots of bloodshed at his hook. His victims are hacked up in brutal ways, allowing for some great FX work as the bodies are shown in gruesome ways as there's a large amount of blood let loose in the film, which isn't until the end, but that is a great way to end the film. While all these manage to work for the film, the fact that the deaths probably could've come at a faster pace is really the only complaint here. He manages to get set free quite early and spends a long portion of time merely tormenting her rather than going directly after her which does tend to make this a little longer than it should in getting to the good points, but otherwise this one is quite fun and enjoyable.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.

Without these things, I am nothing.Clive Barker films have always had interesting 'villains' cause in a sense they are not truly villains as the protagonists tend to provoke them into their work. Of course, everyone remembers Pinhead from the Hellraiser series as being one of the ultimate baddies. But I would like to argue that Candyman could easily come up in that list too. Built upon a similar concept as Freddy Krueger, Candyman only lives on through the fear and whispers of his existence so when Madsen's character threatens that he takes action to conserve and punish those whom threaten him. It takes the urban legend concept and turns it on its head. Not to mention with Tony Todd's bad-ass vocal delivery, bloody hook hand, and monstrous fur coat that hides a hive of bees in his chest, the design of Candyman is quite frankly - HORRIFYING. So by the time he does show up in the film (about half way through or so) his legend is built up that you're not sure what he's going to do - and uncertainty is horrifying too. Throw on that Todd's awesome and subtle acting (is he pained to do what he does? why is she always been the one?) one isn't sure his motives, despite what he says, but we know they are there. And that's brilliant. if you appreciate horror, then you will like this. Viginia Madsen turns in a great performance and Tony Todd is beyond menacing in the role of Candyman.I recommend watching this with a few friends because it is a crowd pleaser.Good direction, great acting, and scenery so real you can almost taste it -Sweets for the Sweet This dark and unnerving horror outing based on a story by Clive Barker and directed by Bernard Rose has quite rightly earned a reputation as one of the best horror films of the Nineties.

One day she comes across the legend of Candyman, a slave who was stung to death by bees after being attacked by a lynch mob in the 1800's. She goes out to the city projects where the gangsters live, and suddenly realizes the racism involved after she is attacked in the washrooms there; several black guys have been murdered there and the cops do nothing, but she is white and when attacked the cops do everything to help her out. Now she has bigger issues though... Candyman is after her! Candyman is a suspenseful movie from start to finish, with great acting and freaky soundtrack. As teenagers we all hear urban legends Bloody Mary, the Hook on the Car Door, and if you're a younger teen you may have heard of Slenderman. Candyman has created a horror film spinning together all these urban myths into an entity beyond comprehension. The film also raises awareness of both racism and the dating that goes on between college professors and their students. Helen is shocked to learn that her husband Trevor, the professor, is dating Stacey, a student much younger than him. The film has some humor too; when Helen is about to take her mirror off the wall, her best friend Bernadette screams, Helen, no! There might be someone on the toilet back there!

It is not only a scary movie but also an evocative horror movie with the intriguing idea about urban legends. We all know the urban legends have the roots in our collective fear of living anonymously in the cities, and the movie puts an interesting spin on it. What if some urban legend is real? And what if it's possible that it is real because it is believed to exist, rather than the other way around? What if it gets the power from the collective belief? If such a thing is possible, then what can be said of the religious or supernatural entities people believe in? Can the same thing be said of them? The movie deals with its idea in a clever way, and it leaves us something to think after we are reasonably scared by the things happening on the screen.It is always welcoming to have the characters who are reasonable in the horror movies, and Helen(Virginia Madsen) and Bernadette(Kasi Lemmons) are well-qualified for that. They are the graduates researching for their doctorial thesis at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Their research subject is the urban legend, and the one that particularly interests them is about Candyman, who people say will come to whoever dares to summon him by saying his names five times while looking at the mirror and will leave the bloody carnage behind him.Like any other academic researchers, Helen and Bernadette don't seriously believe what they hear from the interviews. But they become interested when they coincidentally come to know that Candyman is believed to exist by the people living in the Cabrini-Green Housing complex in Near North Side area of Chicago; they believe Candyman is living in one of those empty tenement. Helen thinks there are the materials worthy of their thesis, and she decides to delve deeper in this subject, despite Bernadette's concern.Her concern is well-justified. Now it is fading into the history by the on-going gentrification process, but Cabrini-Green has been one of the criminally notorious housing complex in USA. Through the movie, made in 1992, we get some glimpses of the environment far, far worse than now. The gang members hang around the front entrance of those coercively looking buildings, and there are dark, dirty, deserted places you do not want to go inside in the buildings. And we see our characters bravely go into these places with the intellectual interest and purpose.The director/writer Bernard Rose, who would make Immortal Beloved after this movie, focuses on the atmosphere at the first half. He knows how to visually mount the unease on the screen. Frequent overhead shots have a subtle menacing tone with Phillip Glass' effectively spooky score. The despair and terror are palpably felt in the corners in Cabrini-Green scenes, and, like Helen, we can see the real world is as horrible as the Candyman legend. This is the dangerous world in which terrible incidents happen and are neglected by the people outside including the police. People living there everyday may just choose to believe the boogeyman whom no one can stop is responsible for all these happenings.But is it just an urban legend born out of the despair of the lower class? Helen seems to think so, but, unfortunately for her, the movie is based on the short story The Forbidden written by the executive producer Clive Barker, who was called The Future of Horror by Stephen King. Like his famous first movie Hellraiser(1987), Clive Barker's horror stories are gruesome and brooding tales of flesh and blood with the supernatural elements, and Candyman is no exception. As you probably guessed it already, it turns out that Candyman is real, and the truth behind him is a lot more intriguing while quite horrifying in itself. It seems that Helen's study makes Candyman piqued more than casually calling his names five times in the mirror.Helen eventually finds herself in a big serious trouble with the police while the shocking incidents happen around her. She knows what's going on but she cannot say about it because nobody can believe her story. To make the matters worse, she is framed for the incidents and nobody believes her innocence &#x96; least of all her untrustworthy husband who never quite says he trusts her words. Following her ordeal, we see frightening things more than before. There is some blood to be shed, and Rose skillfully handles the violent moments while never losing the tension and dread piled upon from the start.And he had the talented cast. Inexplicably, Virginia Madsen had never gotten the chance to fully utilize her talent till her Oscar-nominated performance Sideways(2004), and Candyman was one of few bright spots in her career before Sideways; she is good as a frightened but brave woman who tries to solve her impossible problem. Kasi Lemmons, who would direct Eve's Bayou and Talk to Me, also makes a good impression as Helen's best friend and co-writer. Tony Todd is seductively menacing as a dreadful entity with his hulking presence and deep voice(he would reprise his role in the following worthless Candyman sequels).Even 18 years after it came out, Candyman still holds well as an effectively creepy movie. After the success of Hellraiser, several Clive Barker's works have been translated into the movies for years, but this movie still occupies the top position among others. I think it is a lot better than Hellraiser, which just drones on the blood and other freakish things with some interesting ideas nearly untouched. Candyman has the interesting idea to explore, proceeds with it, and never loses the grip on the idea even when it goes bloody. In the end, even the expected horror movie cliché serves for its idea and provokes another thought in our head while the end credit rolls. Preposterous, yeah, but somehow it's logical in its philosophy. "},{"Title":"A solid and effective horror movie","Date":"20 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" After sitting through the rubbish sequels I saw 'Candyman' again with a heavy heart. I didn't much like it when I first saw it years ago and the quality of the follow-ups didn't exactly didn't exactly fill me with enthusiasm. But it was much improved on this viewing, head and shoulders above the films that followed it. It's no masterpiece but it's a solid horror movie with some interesting ideas.Virginia Madsen stars as Helen Lyle, a graduate student working with her friend Bernadette (Kasi Lemmons) on a thesis about urban legends. In the run-down housing projects of the city, tales are told of Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd), the son of a slave who fell in love with an upper-class white woman and was stung to death by bees after having his hand cut off by her father. Reincarnated as the Candyman, his hand replaced with a hook jutting from the bloody stump, bees buzzing around his mouth, the legend goes that if you look into a mirror and say his name five times he will come for you. Madsen is curious about the story but doesn't believe it's true... and puts it to the test by calling him.'Candyman' is more than just a routine slasher movie. For once the gore is justified, as it plays a part in the story rather than existing as an end in itself. Because the Candyman has a motive with some depth and the movie reaches a satisfying conclusion, it emerges as an inventive film, if not an especially scary one; there are shocks here and there, but it's not a major fright fest. Candyman kills those around Helen to make it look as if she's responsible, which plays into our collective fear of false accusation, and there are these hypnotic, hazy shots of Helen as she seems to be under his spell. The character is creepy and his appearances are kept to a minimum, so there are no one-liners and his origin isn't fleshed out a great deal. Like Freddy Krueger, the character has impact in his first appearance but will be watered down greatly in successive outings. The spectre of the Candyman hangs over the film despite (or because of) his sporadic appearances.On another level, the movie is about the big city attitude to race and poverty, drawing particular power from its setting of cheap housing projects where poor black families are packed away and forgotten about, with little hope of a better life. As one character says, the series of murders in the area receive an apathetic response from the cops, but when Helen is attacked in the same place they come running. The gangs hanging around outside the building, the dank apartments and graffiti on the walls paint a depressing picture of inner-city life. The movie is subtle enough not to push this in your face, but it's a key part of the film's DNA, and of course the title character's beginnings add to the fraught picture of racial tension.The film's credibility is enhanced by thoughtful and low key direction from Bernard Rose (who also wrote the screenplay, from Clive Barker's story 'The Forbidden') and believable performances from all concerned. It's all based on a clever and layered premise rooted in classic urban legends, and it all works unexpectedly well.

More than that, it is a remarkable horror film&#x85;which is no small feat considering the cynical seen-it-all-before-and-know-when-the-scares-are-coming attitudes most cinema- goers show towards horror movies. And yet, Candyman not only has a power to chill, but the power to chill beyond the first viewing. So, what's to account for this? Well, special mention at the outset needs to go to Phillip Glass's eerie and fragile score which carries the melancholy at the heart of the story more than any amount of exposition. Next up is the fact that the movie is an adaptation of the Clive Barker short story The Forbidden, a man whom Stephen King called the future of horror and a writer as cerebral as he is visceral; something which this adaptation does more than adequate justice to in both capturing the essence of Barker's short story, as well as expanding on it. In particular the figure of the Candyman, a mythical figure who is said to appear in the mirror if you say his name five times to garrote the invoker with his hook-for-a-hand and who sustains himself through the fear urban myths of him generate, is taken from the story (as is much of the Candyman's actual dialogue). However, in the short story the protagonist Helen (played in the film by Virginia Madsen) is writing a paper on graffiti and stumbles into the world of urban myths, whereas in the movie Helen and her cohort Bernadette are post-graduate students at the Universtiy of Illinois explicitly writing about the persistence of urban myths from a debunking perspective. However, Helen's fierce skepticism is not content to just document&#x85;she willfully tests the superstition demonstrated by most, even her supposedly intellectual, rational co-researcher and for this eventually gets physically assaulted by a psychotic hood in Cabrini Green, the predominantly black housing project where Candyman is said to haunt. Following this attack, Helen sees the Candyman himself and all manner of gruesome and bloody murders are committed in a way which suggests either the manifestation of a myth or the delusional acts of Helen herself. As such, the movie plays on the audience's fear that those stories we laugh about others believing may have more than a grain of truth to them. What's more, the movie elaborates on the element at social class hinted at in Barker's short story and expands it to encompass race by making Candyman black, and his tragic back story the result of racism. In doing so it adds a poignant and vivid dimension to the story as well as also feeding on all sorts of neuroses white-middle class people (like Helen) have to repress in order to enjoy their privileged lives.Film critic Roger Ebert praised the movie's intelligence but despaired of what he called the movie's extraneous violence, even speculating that at the script stage the story was more refined and the gore was the result of Hollywood execs. Well, personally I don't think it's all that gory and the violence is far from extraneous considering both the racial lynchings which occurred in living memory and which shadow the film in the guise of the Candyman's back story, as well as the simple fact that even though The Forbidden isn't Barker's goriest story by a long stretch it still has eyes being pulled out, genitals cut off, and dead babies rolling across the floor. So much for Ebert's opinion. As it stands, being as society is still rife with racial differences and superficial rationalism predominates our worldview, the film, now over twenty years old, retains all of the qualities that made it powerful when it was released and remains a high-watermark in modern urban horror and Gothic high-romance.

This outraged white members of the town and killed him with bees, and cut off his hand, and jamming a hook into the stump. Now he haunts Cabrini Green, appearing whenever you say his name five times while looking in the mirror. Trying to prove Candyman doesn't exist, Helen gets more than she bargained for when she slowly realizes the myth is true, and starts to realize this murderous figure even loves her.The high point of this film is definitely in the chilling, haunting score by Phillip Glass, a spooky choir with a powerful tone that overwhelms you, and is especially fitting with the essence of Cabrini Green, and the slums in general.The acting is possibly one of the biggest points of this film too. This is especially rare in the slasher genre, since most of these kinds of films are made by new filmmakers, so it's common that you won't find a lot of talent. But here, the actors are convincing and not overplayed like screaming teenagers in other stereotypical slasher flicks.The direction is probably on par with the acting in this film, the way everything comes together is perfect. The music, the story, the visuals, the actors, everything fits perfectly here and the director did a very good job in making sure it all fit. This is definitely a must see for any fan of intelligent horror (as rare as it can be nowadays.) and will definitely please both the gore hounds and the art house fans alike.

The thought of Candyman absolutely frightened me. It is along the same vein of saying Bloody Mary 5 times in a mirror. I won't do it, neither will I do it with Candyman to this day. It is a very creative way to scare people and it sure does a damn good job of it. It doesn't have quite the impact that it did on me when I was younger, but it is still a chilling experience. Clive Barker was ingenious at times for coming up with innovative ways to scare people. I highly doubt you'll see people make Gothic stuff, such as Hellraiser & Candyman these days. That type of creativity is omitted for found footage type movies. Not only does Clive Barker excel at scaring you, but it packs a psychological wallop. This is a slow burning horror film that takes a true horror fan to appreciate. There is even a tragic love story thrown in for good measure, from the background of Danielle Robitaille (Candymam) The scene where Candyman first appears in Helen's life is absolutely chilling. Virginia Madsen's classic line But...I'm late never fails to chill me. I wouldn't call this a gore fest, but it does become brutal at times. I'm not gonna spoil anything. Tony Todd is magnetic as Candyman. He is one of the creepiest horror villains in the history of cinema. Virginia Madsen is a very memorable heroine. She is strong-willed and vulnerable at the same time. She is utterly likable and conveys the proper emotions. Xander Berkeley is despicable as a cheating bastard. The ending is alternately saddening and heroic. I won't reveal the final shot of the movie, but it will stick with you for a bit. it was a neat little twistFinal Thoughts I think the thought of Candyman is so creepy because he exists beyond your imagination. He's a mythical figure that can venture into the real world if you say his name 5 times. I don't know about you, but i'm not gonna try it anytime soon. Even if it isn't real, I'm not taking any chances. If you want a good scare, check this bad boy out. 8.7/10 "},{"Title":"This one is a tough call...  'HELLRAISER' was awesome; but this one, although very atmospheric, the characters seemed a little lacking...

The guy is a top actor. Most the way through, the mood was pretty good, BUT... I'm not sure what it is about this film that somehow creates a disconnect from the story or is lacking somewhat... I KNOW that in the first 15 minutes or so, the acting is SOOOOOOOOOOOO excruciating, that it caused me some serious psychic pain. GEEZ... The first girl telling the story to her boyfriend (good ol' Ted Raimi) couldn't POSSIBLY have been any more plastic and annoying. And even Ms. Madsen, who I normally really like, somehow just comes across surprisingly superficial in her coy little looks, her CONSTANT holding of a cigarette in that overdone clichéd way, and if she bloody rolled her tongue between her teeth just ONE frigg'n more time, I SWEAR I woulda leapt onto the screen and phuk'n killed her myself! I know, I know... I'm WAY over-reacting, but honestly that kind of 'little' stuff REALLY get's up my @ss. Perhaps, if the director could have cut out all that horribly annoying clichéd behaviour and simply brought out more of a GENUINE performance from most of the actors, I truly believe that that would have gone a long way to making this film more effective. For example, when she was researching the 'legend' etc., did she have an earnest expression on her face showing a GENUINE intrigue and studious interest in what caused these murders and what was behind this mysterious legend...? Uh, NO... She sits there with her omnipresent cigarette and with this stupid, vacuous smile on her face which didn't fit the scene at all. WTF...??! We've all seen many of films (Horror and otherwise) where the supposed heroine is studiously searching for clues or the truth behind something and we see the actresses ACTUALLY portraying that BELIEVABLY. NOT looking like they are bleed'n sitting there looking through a Victoria's Secret catalog and dreamily choosing her next lingerie purchase, for God's sake! THAT is precisely what I mean when I mention a'Disconnect' between the character and story...Sorry... but these kinds of things REALLY burn my @ss, they really do. In my lowly and wretched opinion, they honestly add up and greatly diminish the audience's true, full involvement in not only the story, but the characters who are SUPPOSED to be re-enforcing your belief in what is going on. I think what this ultimately does, is it glosses over the characters (with the strong exception of Tony Todd, of course) and makes them appear very plastic and unbelievable, rather than people who you are genuinely concerned about.It's like the movie just didn't have a strong 'Heart' in it that REALLY swept you up in the story. Like I mention in my summary above, even in the way, WAY far out and Fantastical 'HELLRAISER' I, II, and even III, the PEOPLE were actually BELIEVABLE! You were INVOLVED with them and really CARED about them; they seem more REAL than they do here. Even the lovely Terry Farrell in H3 was IMMENSELY more likable and believable than Virginia Madsen here.BUT... with all that said, and even with the very poor characters (or more accurately, the poor DIRECTION of those characters) still, there was a pretty good retro Horror mood overall and like I mentioned, I really DID like the soundtrack very much. And Tony Todd always ROX!Anyway, I just thought I'd add some things which some people may consider more minor points that detracted from the film, as a contrast to review after review saying just how this was 'the best Horror film' of the year or one of the best of all time. It honestly just did NOT strike ME as fitting in with all the TRUE Classics that many people feel are among the best. And, the only thing I can really come up with as the reason for that, is the inferior direction which did not seem to bring out realistic enough performances which is so vital for us, the audience, to be able to invest ourselves emotionally in the characters.So hopefully, if you are not quite as demanding as I am with the characterizations, and you can just sit back and enjoy the creepy atmosphere and Tony Todd's excellent performance, you might actually have a perfectly fine time watching this movie...

Soon Helen realizes that this figure with a hook for a hand is more than just a legend. CANDYMAN certainly stands as one of the best horror films of the 90s as it contains a great story, a creepy atmosphere, some great performances and of course many chilling moments. The story from Clive Barker is certainly something interesting to just think about because the idea of what an urban legend is and how it plays a part in people's lives who believe it is the best thing about the movie. I really loved how director Bernard Rose kept the viewing guessing at all times as to what was going on. Was it really Candyman doing all the killing or had Helen simply lost her mind while doing the research? It certainly helps that you've got such great actors in the leading roles and especially with Madsen. She does an extremely good job in the lead as she really makes you believe all of this stuff that is going on and it's a pretty deep character and the actress has no problems with it. Todd and that iconic voice makes Candyman one of the most memorable screen villains in horror history and that calm and cool nature of the actor really comes across extremely creepy. The film also features a very good score from Philip Glass and of course there's the striking images. I think the film does get a bit too long in the final act but there are just so many effective moments and killings here that you can't help but call this a classic of the genre.

To summon the undead Candyman is simple, gaze into a mirror and repeat his name 5 times and he will appear instantly to&#x85; well gut you like a fish if the movie is right, (why you would want this I'm not sure).The specifics of this seem to change a little depending on circumstances - In one scene two people split the Candyman duties, splitting the 5 repeats between them&#x85; he appears anyway. This would lead me to believe that every time you say Candyman to a mirror is a little like Russian roulette &#x96; as 4 other people could have said it once each elsewhere.- Further to this if you try to be clever and say it 4 times before chickening out depending on the count he could appear at any point in your sequence.- In some scenes Candy appears instantaneously, in others he seems to take a raincheck and pops up later. I guess there are either many people calling on him or the man is just busy doing other things&#x85; Which could mean this is a chore to old Sweetums, and being summoned is like a doorbell; AGAIN, I just finished killing two teens in Miami! Won't you guys give me 5 minutes to clean my hook?  Speculation and wonderment aside the mythology has become folklore in the local area where Helen and Bernadette are writing a paper on *DRUM ROLL Please!* Urban legends.This takes them to Cabrini Green, an urban ghetto area where word has it Candyman resides, after some faked contacts Helen writes off the legend as a fake.Not so fast Helen&#x85; As people near and dear to Helen start dropping like flies in various bloody dismembered puddles, leaving her on the scene the investigators assume she had something to do with things and question her. Each subsequent step seems to implicate even more, and as she protests her innocence still more Candyman contacts and twists ensure she remains a suspect, and the police and her husband start to wonder if she might just be 110% nuts.There is some good simple music in Candyman which lends a bit of class to proceedings, including an effective piano loop that is instantly familiar when you hear it, some gore that may have been extreme in the 90s but hardly raises an eyebrow today, and it is always interesting to watch a period piece where almost everyone smokes and telephones still have cords.This year Natalie Portman put in a gonzo performance as the crizzazy Nena in Black Swan and was lauded for it. But really all she did was pretend to see things, scratch non-existent itches, yell a little and let CGI do most of the rest. As Helen Virginia Madsen gets her gear off a few times, fast-tracks a descent into insanity, emerges from several scenes covered in blood and bits of people, loses her hair and at times acts like a grade A looney. I see both Black Swan and Candyman as equally ludicrous yet one is being seen as somewhat visionary while Candyman was written off as just another slasher film.I guarantee in 10 years no-one will be studying Black Swan as a classic of the modern era&#x85; Candyman is certainly no classic but here I am nigh 20 years later and it is still at least enjoyable.Final Rating &#x96; 6 / 10. 20 year old Candy is probably not going to be as tasty as when it was new, but it still has a little flavour and is at least satisfying.

These days myths spread world wide and at a greater rate, thanks to the internet. Candyman really allows you to feel emotions for these characters. Madsen isn't going crazy, but we can't blame people for thinking she is. Tony Todd has a very dominating screen presence, not to mention a powerful voice.

While interviewing freshmen about their superstitions, she hears about a local legend known as Candyman. The legend contains many thematic elements similar to the most well known urban legends, including endangered babysitters, spirits who appear in mirrors when fatally summoned, and maniac killers with unnatural deformities. The legend states that while Candyman was the son of a slave, he nevertheless became a well known artist. Yet, after falling in love with a white woman who becomes pregnant, Candyman is chased through the plantation and when caught, has his drawing hand cut off and replaced with a hook. He is then smeared with honey (prompting the locals to chant 'Candyman' a total of 5 times- hence the 'say his name 5 times into the mirror'), stolen from a nearby apiary, and the bees sting him to death. The legend also claims that Candyman is summoned by anyone who looks into a mirror and chants his name five times (similar to the Bloody Mary folkloric tale). Summoning him often costs the individual their own life. Later that evening, Helen and her friend Bernadette jokingly call Candyman's name into the mirror in Helen's bathroom but nothing happens.While conducting her research, Helen enters the notorious gang-ridden Cabrini-Green housing project, the site of a recent unsolved murder. There she meets Anne-Marie McCoy, one of the residents, as well as a young boy named Jake, who tells her a disturbing story of a child who was horribly mutilated in a public restroom near the projects, supposedly by Candyman. While exploring the run-down restroom, Helen is attacked by a gang member carrying a hook who has taken the Candyman moniker as his own to enhance his own street credibility by associating himself with the legend. Helen survives the assault and is able to later identify her attacker to the police.Helen later returns to school but hears a voice calling her name as she walks through a parking garage. Another man she encounters states he is the Candyman of the urban legend and because of Helen's disbelief in him, he must now prove to her that he is real. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood. Anne-Marie, whose Rottweiler has been decapitated and whose baby is also missing, attacks Helen and she is forced to defend herself from Anne-Marie using a meat cleaver. The police then enter the apartment and arrest Helen. Is Helen going crazy or will Candyman come for her next?Three words adequately describe Candyman Scary. As. Hell. I was twelve years old when I saw the movie for the first time and it hasn't left my mind since. From the haunting Phillip Glass score to the uncompromising promises by both Tony Todd as Candyman and Virginia Madsen (who has never looked better) as Helen, everything about this movie is sensationally scary. Madsen, in particular, seems to relish playing against time and causes the audience to be sympathetic with her character when a lesser actress would have just come across as annoying. A cheap Carrie rip-off of an ending is the only false beat in this superb thriller from one of the masters of the horror genre, Clive Barker.

Here is a story which is executed with enough intelligence to be both original and scary. Any horror film which can accomplish those two things (and not many can) is unlikely to be a bad film. Candyman draws you in with its strange storytelling and a deep ambiance, not to mention a handful nail-biting scary moments. From what I've described, you'd think nothing could go wrong with Candyman, unfortunately something does. A large middle portion of the movie seems to stray a little too far from the central plot line. Things get stagnant when they should be moving. As a result, Candyman is not quite the film it could've been, but it'll offer enough creativity to impress any horror fans who haven't yet seen it.College student Helen Lyle wants to do a project on the urban legend of the Daniel Robitaille (a.k.a. the Candyman). If you look in a mirror and say his name five times, he will appear, tall and sinister with his bloody hook hand and his bee eaten, rib exposed chest. While Helen searches for the candyman, she starts to realize that he is after her as well. The question is why?The first half hour of Candyman is an ideal example of good horror filmaking, but a couple of strange plot twists set the stage for a somewhat plodding middle section in which not a lot happens. The Candyman has perhaps a little too much screen time, and a lot of his lines are repetitious. He feels far more threatening off-screen than he does on-screen, except for the moments where he appears out of nowhere, those are scary. The climax also feels a little weird, What happens to our protagonist is quite dramatic, but doesn't seem to make much sense. At least there are no major clichés. The way Candyman ends, it is obvious they did not have a sequel in mind, but as is too often the case there is not one but two follow ups to this strange and eccentric film. Candyman is good enough to make you consider watching the next film. It succeeds in a number of other places too, the most important of which is scaring the audience, but I think it needs a little more work, just a little.

Unlike the lofty literary pretensions of GHOST STORY, which weighed down the task of adapting it for the screen considerably, CANDYMAN goes to the essence of the what's, why's and wherefore's of the mythological boogeymen that inhabit so many of our classic ghost stories and fairy tales. It's about betrayal, revenge, lost love, eternal damnation, why our monsters need us to survive...and why, (whether we'd like to admit it or not) we need them as well.Excellently based on Clive Barker's The Forbidden, it's the story of a grad student, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) doing her thesis about Candyman, a ghostly, hook-handed death-dealer who haunts the dilapidated dwellings of the Cabrini Green projects in Chicago. Even though she is warned countless times about the dangers of exploring the truth behind the legend, Helen is drawn deeper into the mystery, the mythology and the horrifying truth behind the Candyman's origins...and he becomes equally fascinated by HER!So their 'danse macabre' of death and desire begins, as bodies pile up with Helen as Candyman's unwitting accomplice, unable to explain her part in the carnage as she questions her own sanity and the very nature of myth vs. reality itself. Anyone who's ever told a tale like this with a circle of friends either round a campfire or in a darkened room at a sleepover, will have to resign themselves to at least a month's worth of nightmares at the stunning ending.Tony Todd (THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake) has the role of his career as the tragic and terrifying title character, and Madsen is nothing less than her amazing self as the woman who comes to love him. Solid support is provided by Kasi Lemmons, Xander Berkeley and Vanessa Williams (no, not the one from ERASER - the one from NEW JACK CITY.) And Brit director Bernard Rose in his genre debut, understands how to bring gore with gravitas to the screen, underscoring the tone of sadly unrequited love in between disembowelings and dismemberings.There is a follow-up, and it's not as bad as sequels usually are, but never mind that.

If not, the film still holds up well in the vein of 'The Silence of the Lambs'. I don't believe in any way that this is a straight up slasher film.

While it has scenes that an audience can expect to see in a slasher film it adds a further, more complex, level to the story by adding the power of lore. The Candyman, you see, is just a legend about a brutally murdered slave whose ghost can supposedly be summoned by chanting his name five times in front of a mirror. There are plenty of stories in the same vein about something awful or strange that happened sometime ago, but if you look in the right corner at the right time of night you'll see the frightening truth. They scare kids (and squeamish adults) but what is interesting that there is so many of them. There doesn't seem to be an end and every now and then a new little urban legend pops up.In respect to the Candyman, if believing makes it so then whoever thought that line up couldn't have been more right. As the film progresses we see how slowly but surely eager and skeptical graduate student Helen Lyle is pulled from disbelief into the middle of her own worst nightmare. It is like a hellish rendition of the moment when after sharing a scary story late in the evening you realize that you don't want to go into the next room alone. You know it is just a story, but it not only changed your heart rate, it changed what you are doing in the real world. Myths and legends are as old as civilization and somewhere, somehow, probably a long time ago they have taken a hold of us and they are probably not letting go anytime soon.In addition to this interesting premise, the music deserves mention and it is simply one of the best horror themes ever composed.

You wouldn't think there could BE anything scarier than that festering housing project, but Candyman--sort of a black Freddy Krueger, only with a hook hand, and handsomer, suaver and less humorous--certainly turns out to be so. This movie thus becomes a fairly intense experience; genuinely creepy and not a little unpleasant. It is also more than a little gory, and certainly not for the squeamish viewer. The premise of the picture is a fascinating one, although by the conclusion, things get a bit confused; I'm still unclear on three or four plot points. Philip Glass' eerie piano-and-strings score adds greatly to the creepy atmosphere, but perhaps the single best aspect of the film is Virginia Madsen in the lead role. What a terrific actress she is...and easy on the ol' blinkers, too! Not surprisingly, she is an even better actress today, 15 years later; surprisingly, she is more beautiful today than ever. (Check her out in the recent, excellent film Sideways if you don't believe me.) It is difficult for me to give a blanket recommendation for Candyman, ugly, violent and downbeat as it is, but for red-blooded horror fans (and I do mean red-blooded), this may just be their cup of (Red Zinger) tea.

Despite its attempts to infuse the proceedings with elements of folklore, mysticism and even romance, the titular 'monster' is really no different than the stalker/boogeyman figure of traditional slasher films! Besides, while there are a few effective scares (especially the hook coming out of the mirror &#150; the film is capped, then, by a CARRIE 1976-like final shock) and considerable gore, Tony Todd's Candyman wasn't as scary or as exotic as I had been expecting; even worse, his would-be portentous dialogue is largely incoherent! However, the film has two definite assets in Philip Glass' simple but haunting main theme and the presence &#150; in both senses of the word &#150; of leading lady Virginia Madsen (surely one of the better female roles to emerge for this type of film in recent times). I'll still be checking out the first sequel at least, which I rented along with this one.

There is no heroic characters saving the day. There is no stupid jokes, actually there is no humor at all. No, this is not funny film. This film is scary in a way I cannot explain.

The original story is set on a Liverpool council estate but the film moves it to Chicago(?).Normally, I despise American adaptations of foreign films and books. Taking a story away from its original cultural context can rip the guts out of it, and Americans are the most insensitive surgeons in this respect. However, Candyman proves me wrong, apart from the rather ridiculous way in which the scary bloke with the bees is summoned. Perhaps this is because Bernard Rose, the director and writer is English? Despite transplanting the action to an American city (and dreaming up the lame Say his name 5 times schtick) Rose does a good job of creating a creepy atmosphere and sustaining suspense.There's very little in this film that wasn't in the original short story and there's very little Standard Horror blood-and-entrails excess too. Tony Todd's Candyman exudes a quiet and purposeful sense of menace without the actor having to enact innumerable scenes of Stalk and Slash, which is the major strength of the film. Too many horror films take a predictable route to gory voyeurism. Candyman stands out because it takes us through the dark woods, rather than down the straight track to the slaughterhouse.Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkely do well in their roles and they are backed up by a fine cast. The only downside to this brooding horror flick is that the door was left open for a sequel. Two other Candyman films were made on the back of the original's success and both follow the Law of Diminishing Returns, if their IMDb ratings are anything to go by.

At least she got some redemption and revenge after she rescues the baby from a fire. The Candyman hook can in really handy after her boyfriend says her name three times. You can just say that his own guilt got him killed. A best weapon for cheating lovers. This movie is leave you on the edge of your seat fun.

The music is magnificent, and is the work of classical composer Philip Glass, who also wrote the haunting score for the quasi-documentary, THIN RED LINE. The sets are terrifying, especially the abandoned Cabrini Green apartments. The acting, at least from Virginia Madsen, is superb. Recurring closeups of her face as she descends into madness tell the story quite effectively. MILD SPOILER From the moment Madsen wakes up covered in blood, with a dog's head at her feet, you want this film to be a dream from which she will eventually wake up. Unfortunately, it is not and she does not. The gore is over the top and frankly unnecessary. Oddly, the least effective aspect of this horror classic is Tony Todd as Candyman, who really isn't given much to do except stand around in a fur-trimmed coat. He has done much better work. ANOTHER SPOILER For those who don't quite get the ending (or think it is too contrived), Madsen has managed to kill Candyman, whom we see burnt to a crisp in the bonfire. Now she has replaced him as a new urban legend. By the way, the shots of her corpse, near the end, are a true heartbreaker. For anyone who has ever seen someone who died from a fire or some ravaging disease, her corpse is all too real-looking.

Excuse me people, this is horror. It's supposed to contain supernatural and or gory situations.Sprung from the mind of Clive Barker, the genius behind Halloween and Nightbreed(YES this IS a cool movie) comes a bleak and sinister tale concerning an Urban Legend. We all know about Urban Legends(and no I don't mean the movie). I mean the stories about for instance the couple out on Lover's Lane who are making out in the car and hear a noise and flee, only to find a hook hanging from the car door when they get home. Or the old lady who dried her dog in the microwave after she washed him.This movie is about such an Urban Legend. Only in this movie the Urban Legend turns out to be true A killer with a hook for a hand who appears behind you when you say his name 5 times while standing in front of a mirror...If the movie had only told you this the movie indeed would have been a simple slasher movie. This however is not the case. There is a background story here. And the place in which most of the murders take place. Also there is reason WHY he chooses Helen to be his victim. But we only find that out towards the end of the movie.  This is why Candyman deserves a place among the classics in the often shallow genre of Horror. A short synopsis  *Contains spoilers* Helen, the main character, is doing a thesis about Urban Legends. At one points a couple of events drive her to investigate one legend in particular. The legend about the Candyman. A supernatural killer with a hook for a hand. Her investigation leads her to a ghetto named Cabrini Green which supposedly is the hunting ground of the Candyman.  With every person she talks to she's more and more drawn into the world of myth and legend until she is attacked by a gang led by a guy who calls himself The Candyman. This is where things go wrong.  After the attack she believes that the guy who attacked her is the reason why people believe in the Candyman. And the people in Cabrini Green also start to believe that the killer was this gang-leader.However when at one point she is walking to her car in an abandoned car-park, she hears a low voice calling her. When she turns around she sees a tall black man in a long coat with a bloody hook for a hand... Candyman is real...Candyman deserves a place in the classics in the genre of Horror. I admit I haven't seen all of the classics, but I have seen many of them such as Halloween, Nightmare On Elmstreet, Carrie, Night Of The Living Dead and Hellraiser. And I don't mean the sequels. Those were fun in their own right but don't deserve the title Classic. Candyman deserves to be in that list of Classics. It's intelligent has some good acting in it and has a good story. Plus is is suspenseful. Something that I miss in many so-called horror movies. Plus it lacks that horrible obsession with humor that most horror movies of late have. Highly recommended.

It begins like a crime investigation and changes into a psychological, if a bit supernatural thriller. Many parts of the movie grab your attention, and the story flows smoothly. Our main heroine is not some annoying, tom boy-like girl with a brain the size of a peanut and a body that screams for a sandwich. Most of CANDYMAN works and I give it two thumbs up.Two college graduate friends write a thesis on urban legends. One legend sparks the curiosity of our main character, Helen, and she investigates further. Say his name five times in the mirror and the Candyman will gut you with his hook. Everyone is scared but Helen who goes deep into Chicago 's gang land to learn more.The supernatural parts are ridiculous. The Candyman throws some DRACULA-like romance to his sadistic strategy. Many parts are silly, but just as many are intriguing enough to keep you watching, especially when the Candyman finally appears. Many lines from the Candyman 's mouth are hilarious. His 'writing on the wall,' quote was funny, knowing how his painting looks sort of like a certain Pink Floyd cover. CANDYMAN is a good movie, with some silly parts, and a sillier ending. But it still gets my approval. Its slow but smart nature takes it one step above a pointless scream generator.

This isn't a good enough film to rent, but if you happen to see it on television one night, you might want to watch it just for the frightening finale. "},{"Title":"Mixed feelings","Date":"8 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Candyman is a gem of a horror movie ... in comparison to the lackluster entries into the genre of late. Which says much about the sorry state of horror. Unfortunately, by it's own merits, it isn't everything and more. The one thing that cannot be refuted is it's great word of mouth. Upon it's initial release, I heard such great things about it and even now many years down the road, it's kept in high regard by many. So admitting my disappointment finally having seen Candyman ... is bittersweet.I see why people rally behind it. The story is certainly mature, which is refreshing. It flows with a real life darkness and a gory atmosphere along with stronger than average leads in Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen. There just happens to be a significant downside in my book. It isn't overly scary - whenever mature or not - whenever it's a traditional horror film or not - and the story is functional at best. An urban legend based out of a primary geographical location and carried on by a selective demography of people. Colleges always teach this stuff? in movies? in real life? Hmm.I can't deny the name Clive Barker and the association that brings had a part in setting my expectations high and hype left unchecked can derail a movie before you even see it. Maybe this is one of those times, but being blunt, Candyman is overrated. Yes, the principle leads are good, particularly, I speak of Tony Todd as the principle character. He's done with a simple sort of flair, but obviously has tapped into something. That cannot be dismissed. He's ripe for exploration and exploitation (see sequels of diminishing returns). However the movie this character is housed in isn't groundbreaking.We're not all going to agree on this, but Candyman is still better than the majority of garbage being sold under the horror banner these days. It doesn't bring that much needed spark to a genre that's seen it's share of dog days, but it's decent in it's own right. Only not to the extent some people make it out to be. "},{"Title":"All you have left is my desire for you.","Date":"24 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI have to confess that the initial appeal of Candyman was completely lost on me. Only on second viewing could I begin to fully appreciate what it has to offer.Thematically it's similar to Clive Barker's other great film success, Hellraiser. Not just in the way that dabbling in forbidden practises will raise the undead, but in it's necessary plot contrivances. That the heroine (Helen/Kirsty) can call forth the creature/s which slay on sight, yet are allowed, by a tweaking of the film's own rules, to converse with their tormentors. Just as Pinhead and co. would spend their existence tearing men limb from limb the instant they solved the lamentation configuration box; here the mad slayings of Candyman are put on hold as he finds all manner of reasons, or alternate victims, to let Madsen survive to (almost) the end of the film. However, this is neatly explained by Candyman's desire for her, proving he's a man who knows all about the birds and... er... the bees.Its subtext is what makes the film most rewarding. Not only does it play on accepted urban myth and superstition (even though the particular myth is fabricated, I find very few people WILL dare to say his name five times), but also sociological fears. Or, in the same sense, urban myths again. That is, the myth of the white woman being subjugated by the black man.Of course, this being a horror film, even one well above the intellectual average, it does round up the usual stereotypes. A fellow lecturer, the most pompous and self-important character in the whole film, is English, while the policewoman who orders Madsen to strip for searching is a butch bulldog of a woman who obviously receives sexual gratification from said task.There is also some nice quizzical gothic music throughout, which can get a little over the top and pretentious, but is generally quite beautiful. The notion of Helen's sanity is often called into question, and we see scenes where Candyman cannot be picked up by camera, causing us to believe it may all be in her mind. This also leads to some black humour as various characters double take at the sheer number of mitigating circumstances Helen finds herself under.Yet what initially made me dislike the film is its fundamental lack of scariness. The use of mirrors is always a guaranteed spooker, though the name Candyman had only previously seen the inside of cinemas when sung about in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The fact that when Candyman does arrive he's dressed like a camp pimp and has a tendency for poetic prose didn't add to the fear factor. I must admit to finding Tony Todd a little scarier this time around as the first time I thought he was putting on a ludicrously deep voice. It turns out that this is Todd's real voice, though it still seems to be siphoned through some form of modulator. His somewhat exaggerated supernatural powers and fleeting appearances led me to conclude that this was a scary movie that forgot the scary, but then of course that's missing the point.Candyman is both victor and victim rolled into one, a phantom of the opera for the nineties. His literary origins are quite impeccable, and when the book of Frankenstein is mentioned towards the start of the movie, this is counterbalanced by an ending that references the 1931 adaptation by Universal. He has a hypnotic hold over women, like a Dracula/De Sade hybrid, and his rapport with Helen means that this could justifiably be seen as a romantic movie. Perhaps not a good idea to take someone out on a date to see it though. Only a predictable and trite coda really detracts from what is a thoughtful, and thought-provoking, modern horror.The same choral themes occur in the pointless sequel, Farewell to the Flesh. However, this merely serves to illustrate how mainstream and tacky the follow-up is. While it's an established rule that sequels are rarely as good as their predecessors, this is &#150; Bride of Frankenstein and Dawn of the Dead possible exceptions &#150; doubly true with horror sequels. Before you can say Freddy 2-6 or Michael Myers 2-7, Candyman re-emerges onto the scene with souped-up gore, dumbed-down dialogue and an irritating DJ who narrates the thing for the hard of thinking. A sort of Annie through the Looking Glass as Kelly Rowan tries to find the one big mirror that can finally destroy the Candyman. Everything is spelt out in this one, including a depiction of his death which is unnecessary and nowhere near as striking as it was when narrated in the first. Of course, the real problem is that Candyman is such a self-contained story that it doesn't NEED a sequel. But Hollywood beckoned with its chequebook and so even if Candyman 3 wasn't intentionally the end of the series, it would have killed it off anyway. Avoid the inferior follow-ups, watch Candyman as a solo work... it's really quite wonderful. "},{"Title":"An urban fairy-tale without happy-ending. A gentle slasher.","Date":"27 December 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  From the viewpoint of style and aesthetics, the movie is truly unique, at least I cannot think of anything quite like it.A simple story of the same kind that small kids tell each other in summer camps after lights-out. This simplicity is a trademark of the movie. Watching this one gives you a feeling similar to the fascination of a child with something as predictable as another fairy-tale, and yet appealing to a mind that can still get spell-bound with the same old story. It's like looking through a comic-book, which you could scan at a glance, and yet can't stop reading the captions before you reach the end. Because such is the beauty of a story-telling that holds your attention till the last minute.The atmosphere of the film is surprisingly gentle, if not to say feminine, with a simple yet exquisite touch to everything, that I won't give away. You have to see it to believe that such things can be found in a slasher, although, technically speaking, the genre is pretty hard to determine. On the one hand, you got to brand it as horror simply for the lack of a more suitable common term, at least, I don't understand the idea of a psychological thriller where characters get ripped with a meat hook by someone who walks through walls and doesn't really exist. On the other hand, you could tell that the movie, with its evident focusing on the aesthetic side, was never actually intended to be scary. Much rather sad and weepy in a good sense.The film is based on Clive Barker's moralistic concept of attractive evil, which by definition can't give you any good old scares, but can still freak you out a bit, and, what's most important, superbly fits the story and its implications.Watch this one with a child's heart, and you'll get it broken when you're done. I almost wish I hadn't seen it yet, because you'll never get this special feeling except when you see it for the first time.The acting is as good as it gets for the category. Personally, I'm content with the fact that I liked the principal characters, especially the girls, Helen and her friend. They are really sweet, and it feels sad to see them get wasted after all. Candyman himself is also a way charming fellow whom you would sure love to meet, minus the hook. Certainly, a winning part, which, by the way, is in perfect keeping with the said concept of attractive evil.The juvenile delinquents playing Candyman are very convincing and give more depth to his legend, which begins to look flawless in its brutality (plus love story) perfectly clinging to the immature mind. This almost makes you believe that Candyman is a real-life urban legend.The opening sequence is fantastic and unforgettable. The dilapidated Cabrini Green settings get a special credit for imaginative turn. The musical score is completely fabulous and heart-rending.If you don't mind to drop a tear once in a while, the movie is your cup of tea. Buy it and watch it any time you want to feel sad and kind of lonesome.The film is worth saying a lot more, which I would certainly do but for the restrictions. For instance, it would be interesting to discuss the similarities between Candyman and Hellraiser with more insight into Clive Barker's writings.There's another thing, if you like this film, you might also want to check out its sequel, which is nowhere near so good, but is still worth your attention because of the final scene, the one with the tinsel stuff jingling over the little girl's bed to the accompaniment of gentle music. Cool!Last but not least, the other reason to view the sequel is because some of its look and feel might remind you of Angel Heart. This one is a masterpiece for those who can appreciate it. Highly recommended. "},{"Title":"Horrific","Date":"1 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  In Candyman, you would expect nothing less but an old urban legend.

The psychological horror of the film really got to me. However, as with most horror films I never even get the slightest bit uncomfortable the second time I watch it. Don't get me wrong, though, Candyman is a good film. Much better than the pathetic Clive Barker-film Hellraiser (that film is really a laugh, a slimy skeleton isn't exactly the definition of 'scary' according to me. So okay, that film has its moments of sheer beauty at least one scene but scary&#133; nah, don't think so). Candyman is without a doubt one of the best serious horror films I have ever seen -- I can't really count the Scream-trilogy since those films are as much comedy as horror. Definitely (almost) up there with films like The Shining (Kubrick-version) and The Exorcist -- they are all psychological horror films and those films are the only films that can scare me at least the first time I see them. Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th&#133; those films only make me laugh. Anyway, Candyman is a good film. Recommended.

I get to see plenty of the blood and guts stuff in my job so I find it in movies pretty boring. Same as cemetery's. After 30 years living close to the biggest one in the Southern Hemisphere I find the atmosphere of cemeteries soothing rather than creepy, the opposite of what most horror films try to make you feel. The opening to Night Of The Living Dead - that works for me). Back to the main programme ... The trouble I have is with the second half of the movie where it moves from urban legends/paranoia into a trite formulaic rehash of Universal's The Mummy via H. Rider Haggard's She (which has literary antecedants of its own).

Not just because it's genuinely scary, it's also intelligent (unlike 80% of all the slasher movies), it's extremely well acted, and it's serious which is always a plus in my book. I just don't ever get scared by movies that don't take themselves or their characters seriously. People making jokes or wise-cracking while they're being stalked by an unseen terror has always been a mood-killer for me. But besides that, the movie has got great production values. There has obviously been paid a lot of attention to the look and feel of the movie. The haunting, beautiful score by Philip Glass adds to the mood of the film. The photography has a realistic feel to it. It doesn't look glossy and smooth like most movies. The fact that the main character is framed by the killer is also pretty original for this type of movie. And the gore in this movie is really violent, and looks horrible, as it should. It should never be fun to watch people get butchered because it takes away any realism there may be. It's NOT fun to actually see people having their backs split open with a hook. What may be the best thing is that there is a certain tragedy about the Candyman character. This is not a mute mask wearing loser who was wronged and wants revenge, but you can't relate to. This is a character who was tortured and brutally murdered for doing nothing but love a woman. This character is not making jokes or being funny, and is therefor all the more realistic and even tragic. It's the combination of all it's qualities that make this one of the best thrillers / horrormovies of the 90s period!(Too bad some producers couldn't help themselves and had to ruin a great new horror icon in the sequels).

The idea of a killer coming when you call him is very interesting because it is different from what we have seen before.

That's a point that many other films of the genre lack.Another element that adds to the very moody atmosphere is the directing. There are some amazingly exciting shots, especially the aerial views of Chicago which are unique. The mood makes the film somehow disturbing and fascinating at the same time and that's why there isn't any other film like this one. There are some pretty gory scenes but the brutality here is never used to entertain.

The urban decay into which Helen wanders is as chilling and disturbing as the Candyman's own appearances. Like 'Seven', the film uses its urban setting not just as an unpleasant backdrop, but as an integral part of the film's fabric, strengthening its impact and relevance.Virginia Madsen gives a fine performance (under the circumstances - no Oscars here). She looks older than her 29 years, which again helps the film to stand out since it's not about teenagers in peril but about mature characters about whom we might actually care. The supporting cast aren't bad, either, though this is really Madsen's show. She looks nothing like her brother, does she?Intelligently scripted, and carefully crafted (others have drawn attention to Philip Glass's excellent score - another splendid move by the film makers), this is vastly superior to the Elm Street series.

He is one of the few people who heighten the genre to what it could and should be, refusing to go for the mediocrity of mainstream. This is not a slasher, although it can appear to be one at points. Candyman is carefully and expertly established and built up, and is thus infinitely more effective than all the monsters and killers that were not graced by a director who understands the importance of climax. The fact that Tony Todd adds volumes of creepiness as well as genuine charisma(!) to the role is also invaluable. This is immensely engaging and downright touching human picture. It is rather scary and unnerving. are the While the acting varies a tad, it is beyond reproach the majority of the places where it really matters. This has by far one of the most compelling performances and delivery by a child *ever*. I kid you not, he could outdo quite a lot of grown-ups who have greater experience than him just by virtue of the age difference. The concept is well-thought out and interesting. This has marvelous editing and the cinematography is nice. The tone is serious throughout, and this makes no excuses for it and does not try to broaden its appeal by adding comic relief. There are a couple of laughs to be had, and they're all well-integrated. This has a ton of sick and disturbing content, plenty of bloody and at times gory violence, infrequent mild to moderate language and brief nudity.

At the store I kind of settled on this tonight, but when it came time to hit play I got excited to review it). The area where Cabrini Green is was a scary enough area as it is without the bogey-man hanging around. I lived about a mile or more from there in the early millennium and a large amount of those projects were being torn down by then. I would drive through that neighborhood daily because it was quick with little traffic (go figure!), but even 2 or 3 years prior to that time I wouldn't have even driven through there (and I don't scare easily). Today, I think there are 2 buildings left, though not sure. I would make a bet that it is one of the most changed neighborhoods in the country right now. There is still a ton of squalor, though now off the main tracks (North, Elston, Divi...like many hoods here) but now it's like an older extension of Wicker Park (a hipster hood) with a ton of shopping, etc. Still a tough spot though so keep an eye out west of Halsted!So, on topic, Cabrin Green itself was/is far scarier than anything else in the actual movie, but there's some great scares throughout, Fun Movie!

At first she thinks it is just another of the stories her students are telling her till she hears that a murder on the Cabrini-Green Project (a Chicago slum) has been attributed to the eponymous Candyman.She is even more interested when she learns her own up-market apartment was originally intended to be part of the project till planners realised it was to close to the more refined parts of town. She goes to Cabrini-Green with a colleague to investigate and thinks she has solved the mystery when a gang member using the Candyman myth to scare the residents assaults her. However once he is arrested the real Candyman appears in order to make the people fear him once more.Helen soon finds herself apparently framed for the kidnapping of a child and the murder of her colleague. While she sees the Candyman nobody else does so for a while we don't know if he is truly there or if she has gone insane and is actually committing the crimes herself. We do of course find out but I won't spoil that here.Virginia Madsen is very good as Helen but Tony Todd steals the show as the charismatic Candyman.

Yes, Im one of these people that will walk into the supposedly haunted house alone whilst bricking myself, the kind of guy that will hang out the side of the roller-coaster in order to raise the scar factor just that little bit higher. I love horror because I love to be scared. Now, the funny thing is I very rarely find horror movies scary. But there is that one film floating around waiting to scare the bejeezus out of us. To date, there have only ever been two movies that have managed to do what they're supposed to and they are The Shining and The Exorcist. The Japanese film Audition came pretty close but it just failed to make the leap from being simply disturbing to being balls to the walls terrifying.Well congratulations Candyman, for you have succeeded where many others have failed and made me feel the most uncomfortable watching a movie since, well, the first time I saw The Exorcist and The Shining. Sure, you could say this is a slasher movie at heart, I mean, there's plenty of hacking and slashing and the main antagonist has a hook for a hand but in shifting the Gothic tale of pain and suffering from the haunted castle to the urban squalor of the projects in Chicago, the film creates a palpable sense of dread from the get go, personifying what makes urban legends so damn scary in the first place they take place in a neighbourhood just like your own. How many times have our friends claimed to have known someone who has been harassed by phone calls whilst babysitting only to have the caller be in the house with you (The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs)? I remember hearing these tales all through my college days and never really believing any of them because, well, they were stupid. But that didn't stop them being less creepy. And as the urban legend of the Candyman begins to manifest itself in the real world, you really begin to feel the characters dread.The Candyman himself deserves to be in the horror hall of fame with the likes of Hannibal Lector and Freddy Kruger. Not showing up until well passed the half way point, his entrance is one of the most unnerving things I've ever had to sit through. Tony Todd really portrays this guy with a great sense of menace, his movements conveying a slight air of pretension but, at the same time, being really imposing. Probably helps the Todd is 9 feet tall and 7 feet wide (well&#133;that's a lie, but he's pretty big). But it's not his stance that makes him so effective. This is a performance that's entirely vocal. In a stroke of genius, the film makers have amplified his voice, making it dominate the soundtrack every time he speaks. It becomes instantly distressing and I found both my brother and I shifting uncomfortably in our seats, looking at each other with big frowns of unease.Despite the high levels of blood and gore, the death scenes actually turn out to be pretty terrifying themselves, with one in particular taking place off screen, leaving the viewer with a barrage of horrific screams and gut wrenching sound effects that made it seem all the more worse, causing my brother and I, again, to shift nervously in our seats. The main plus points in the effectiveness of Candyman's killing spree ist hat his victims aren't horror archetypes these are innocent people. And the fact that the film is played so straight faced makes it somehow worse.Now let me address you quickly about something that bothers me about horror movies. Now if you think about it, the idea of a psychopathic killer running around murdering people is nasty. Sure the horror genre has taken a more tongue-in-cheek way of doing this as of late to, to the point where it eventually becomes fun to see who will die next and how. Now that's OK in a Final Destination kind of way but for me, the idea of someone in a mask stalking teenagers isn't really fun at all, it's really nasty. I mean c'mon, how are you gonna react when you have some sharp instrument thrust into your gullet? You're not gonna have the big breasted blond clasping her hands on her face and scream Hammer Horror style as if she's just had a spider crawl up her leg rather than been stabbed, in reality, it's gonna really bloody hurt. Now being that this film is totally straight face and deadly serious, that is EXACTLY how these victims react. I wont go into the gory details needless to say, it's disturbing. This is just a very effective horror movie. It managed to scare the hell out of me and that's bloody unprecedented. It was so tense in places that if anyone had walked in at that precise moment they would've been blasted through the roof on a stream of my own terrified p*ss. OK, that's an over exaggeration but to say it's pant-wettingly scary ain't far off. Obviously my gushing review will quite possibly hype it up to the stage that anyone curious enough to see it after this will wonder Luke, you charismatic stallion, what were you getting so worked up about? but you know what? Get lost you cynical nit pickers, it's a horror movie that does exactly what it says on the tin and with gusto too.

Helen discovers that Candyman is all too real -- and very deadly. Writer/director Bernard Rose, adapting the story The Forbidden by Clive Barker, does an expert job of creating and sustaining a grimly serious and despairing tone while shedding plenty of fascinating light on contemporary inner city blight and the need for myths in a bleak and unforgiving world. Moreover, Rose tells you just enough about Candyman to make him a palpably frightening source of fear and dread, but thankfully doesn't over-explain things with a lot of unnecessary excess exposition. It's this welcome and refreshing element of eerie ambiguity that makes this picture so scary and unnerving. Madsen and Todd both contribute top-notch work; they receive sterling support from Xander Berkeley as Helen's smug, faithless professor husband Trevor, Vanessa Williams as feisty struggling single mom Anne-Marie McCoy, De Juan Guy as scrappy kid Jake, Carolyn Lowery as Trevor's foxy student mistress Stacey, Michael Culkin as smarmy academic Philip Purcell, and Ted Raimi as bad boy teen Billy.

Basically Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a student writing a paper about urban legends in Chicago, and the one she is most interested in is the Candyman (Tony Todd), a black ex-slave turned artist, real name Daniel Robitaille, who was punished in his time by villagers, after getting a white girl pregnant. They sawed off his right hand (and covered with honey, the sequel apparently details this as where he got his nickname), and he was stung to death by bees, and apparently he comes back to life wielding a large bloody hook where his hand was. The legend says that Candyman will appear if you say his name five times in a mirror, and he will kill them with his weapon, so Helen and her friend Bernadette 'Bernie' Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) are investigating mysterious, unsolved murders happening in Cabrini Green, that may or may not have been caused by this legendary killer. Interviewing people who have heard the legend, and witnesses or those around at the time of murders, particularly of a woman in an abandoned apartment, most say that Candyman is responsible, but Helen doesn't believe the legend. This is until she meets Candyman, he believes that Helen is his true love, and some time later after waking up from this meeting she is covered in blood, a dog was killed and the black woman's baby is missing, so she is charged with this crime. Her husband Trevor (Terminator 2's Xander Berkeley) and many others are questioning her innocence and beliefs, and Candyman is getting away with more and more murders, as he is invisible to others, until of course she says his name five times in the mirror and they are his victim. In the end, Helen gets caught in a bonfire with the baby Candyman kidnapped, but she managed to get away from the fire, and trap him inside, but she still died from her severe burns. After the funeral her husband Trevor is so distraught and he accidentally says her name in the mirror five times, he unintentionally summons her, as she has become like the Candyman, and kills him. Also starring Vanessa Williams as Anne-Marie McCoy, DeJuan Guy as Jake, Marianna Elliott as Clara, Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Billy, Ria Pavia as Monica and Mark Daniels as Student. Todd gives a suitably dark and cold-faced performance as the hook-handed killer, and Madsen is alright as the lead female victim, the bloody effects are great, including the disturbing sight of bees from Candyman's mouth and stomach, it is one of those cult favourites and certainly a horror film to see.

Upon her research, she stumbles upon a series of accidents and her research is quickly lost and forgotten as the movie goes on.The look of Candyman in the shadows is very creepy and his deep deep voice will echo in your head long after you see this movie.Next time that you look in the mirror, don't think about this movie and seriously don't say his name!

I felt for Virginia Madsen's character the whole way through, it was very sad to see her friends begin to die and she is the only one blamed, without being able to prove that a ghost did it.Tony Todd was also great as the villain, the 'Candyman.' He is very creepy, but also a tragic character when you hear his origin.Bernard Rose creates a dark atmosphere through his directing while there is an amazing, haunting score by Phillip Glass.One thing that was very original in this film was that in usual ghost films, the ghost haunts a dark and secluded mansion, but here, the Candyman haunts the projects in a big city.

I gave it a low rating on IMDb and said it had creepy atmosphere. I think at the time I was just too disturbed by the film to recommend it - seriously, I'm not easily scared by movies, but this kept me on the edge and mentally disturbed me more so than most films do.It has some really shocking scenes that work less on a blood and guts level than on a psychological level. Not much is shown - Candyman is portrayed rather non-distinctly in misty flashbacks or hallucinogenic images that are downright eerie.The acting isn't great but it doesn't need to be. It works well for what it is - since when was the acting in Halloween really anything special? Overall this is a creepy, well-directed, atmospheric, scary film that will haunt you for a long time. Years later I've seen the sequels and admire this one even more. It's stayed with me, and I admire that it implies rather than describes and explores.I'd highly recommend this and say it's one of the best true old-fashioned horror films of the 1990s.

For some of us, it's Bloody Mary, and for some of us, it's Jack The Ripper. No matter who the Aloysius, the story is the same Say their name five times, and they'll pop up behind you and gut you with a hook! Oh what joyous times have I had with friends with the myth. For my town, it was Rose Mary. It was a sad bit of history taking place at an abandoned church which was located about fifty yards or so from my Virgian home. They said that she was killed and then raped there, and that seeing how she died a virgin and was sent to hell not one, that Satan spat her back up to Earth to the place where she died. Kids would make up reports of people who went to the church where found miles away, gutted, with a trail of blood that lead all the way back to the church. If you say her name in the mirror five times, she'll tear out you're heart and drag it all the way to the church, so no matter where you died, there'll be a trail of blood leading to where she died. Good times, good times. Several years (and several moves I may add) later, Candyman was released. I was excited, but unfortunately never had the chance to see in it theaters. Well to all wondering, yes, there's a point to my long-winded history lesson, because years later, I was browsing through the TV tube, when to my miraculous delight, I saw Candyman, just about to start. I turned off the lights and closed all my drops, and the only light in the room was the beautifully illuminating glow of my TV screen. The screen faded from the pre-show to black, and then the marvelous orchestral score began, and in big, narrow letters the title appeared. The movie starts off simple, a high school girl invites a boy to come over one night while she baby sits her little sibling, just to have a little rocking, when the two teenagers lead up to the bathroom. The high school girl dares her hump-buddy to say the name of her town's deadly soul, Candyman, in the mirror five times. Grinning, the horny-hungry teen says the name. Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman.... Failing the challenge of the girl, he's sent downstairs to wait for her 'present'. The girl, for some unknown reason, turns to the mirror, and substituting for her 'friend's final saying, repeats the name for the fifth time. There is silence. The girl turns off the light to the bathroom, and blood splatters the camera. Wow, what wild ride I had that night. Decapatations, guttings, and dozens of cheap thrills lie before more. I embraced every minute of it, and when it was over, I walked into the bathroom, and said the name four times. Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman... Then I looked in the mirror. I opened my mouth. And I waited. I still haven't said the name for the final time. Perhaps I'll invite someone over, a 'friend', and perhaps I'll just have to dare my friend.

Well-written and well developed, it has a cracker of a premise that makes us care what happens to Virginia Madsen's character, which is why we must watch to the end. Virginia Madsen is very cute, albeit with big early 90's hair. Good creepy music, though Phillip Glass has clearly gone to the Nightmare on Elm Street school of synthesiser soundtrack-making. There is a very nice Hannibal-esque piano theme i liked in particular.It insists on involving itself in the race war in Chicago, which it tends to over-simplify bright graffiti, gangs, slum district, starving babies and police not caring about black people but caring about white people. The fact that the original Candyman crime happened in the slum district where Virginia Madsen then spends some key scenes of the film (which i won't spoil) and then combined with this the fact that Candyman is African-American (this on its own would not be significant), combined with all these other factors it seems to signify something).Candyman's grandiose uniform, his resonant voice and presence and the choral/organ music all come together to create an impression of Candyman as a kind of preacher. This is eventually built into his dialogue at one point he refers to having to leave his congregation. The belief in the Candyman is likened to belief in Dracula and Frankenstein, and urban myths like alligators in the sewers, but here Candyman is also linked with cultist beliefs and religions. Do you believe in me? Candyman asks Virginia Madsen. Come with me, and be immortal.I'm not quite sure what all this signifies perhaps Candyman is reaping the retribution of the African-American community who've been wronged by their white suppressors, but it seems awfully like Candyman represents the malicious out of control African Americans that need to be kept in check. This was not their intent, their intent was to have us feel sorry for Candyman, in the tradition of Frankenstein's monster and Jason from Friday the 13th, where the killer has been abused and tortured and made what they are. The problem with this is that being abused by one set of people when you're young does not excuse sadistically gutting a bunch of random other people.This is why a horror movie is not usually a suitable disguise for social commentary, because the requirements of the horror plot interfere with the social commentary.

After hearing stories about the myth of the Candyman (Tony Todd) she and her friend Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) decide to investigate the myth further. According to the legend if you stare into a mirror and recite the word `candyman' five times then you will call him and he will come for you so obviously that is what Helen decides to do, but it didn't work&#133;.or did it?&#145;Candyman' has to be credited as at least one of the top five horror films of the 1990's due to its interesting and unnerving subject matter. The story takes the ideas of harmless urban legends (much similar to the &#145;Bloody Mary' legend) and gives them an evil and physical form. While some people have slated &#145;Candyman' for ignoring its own rules I don't think it did. &#145;Candyman' is not a straight forward horror film; there is an intricate plot which requires thought to be fully understood. The Candyman is expected to act one way but chooses to do otherwise, he plays games and confuses people with riddles, why does he do this? Those are the type of things that people make complaints about when talking about this film, he should do one thing but does another, however the reasoning for this is explained in the film if people look for the answer. &#145;Candyman' itself is a rather interesting and complex puzzle that needs thought to figure out.Bernard Rose does a great job of creating an unnerving and dark atmosphere which is complimented perfectly by the haunting music. The film has an almost religious feel to it without actually being a religious-based movie and an abundant sense of dread is created through some inventive and impressive direction. Virginia Madsen's performance should be acknowledged as well as she plays her role very well, even generating feelings of sympathy for her character.The only thing I'd say that this film lacks is character development. While Madsen's character is developed well the other characters in the film, including the Candyman himself, remain rather under-developed. While I will agree that leaving a certain air of mystique to the Candyman is a good idea and enhances the whole experience I feel that Bernadette and Trevor Lyle (Xander Berkley) become almost unrelated characters. The relationships between Helen and these two characters aren't explored enough and this I feel negatively effected a couple of scenes where these were pivotal characters.However, even taking that into consideration &#145;Candyman' is definitely worth watching for horror fans and even just casual movie fans. This is a quite ingenious and thought-provoking movie that doesn't rely on gore and cheap effects but rather its self-generated dark atmosphere to provide tension and shocks.

The movie is obsessed with the unpleasant aspects of life, and since all the characters are so unpleasant, you couldn't care less if the Candyman kills them. You just hope he'll get on with it so the movie will end soon. Another horrible moment is - believe it or not - Virginia Madison stripping. Yes, because she's covered in blood. What a nice film. And that's the emphasis of this film - nastiness, not scariness. The climax doesn't make sense - the Candyman can transport himself anywhere when he wants to, but when he's trapped in a bonfire he can't all of a sudden, and the final scene 'shock' is painfully obvious from the second it begins.

As is the norm with recent horror releases, the film hardly seems deserving of a cinema release, offering little more than your average video fodder.The story involves a female researcher Helen Lyle (Madsen), and her investigations into the myth of the Candyman, a supernatural killer who appears when his name is spoken 5 times into a mirror. Information leads to a run-down block of flats where murders have been attributed to the Candyman. Helen soon becomes entangled with the mythical elements, implicating herself with the deaths.I really don't know what has happened to the horror genre in the last 20 years. I'm a massive horror fan, but films like 'Candyman' cannot hold a candle up to the Universal films of the 30's & 40's, Val Lewton's films for RKO, the Vincent Price period dramas of the 60's, or the multitude of Hammer films from the late 50's onwards. Some of these films may have been cheaply made or badly acted, but they never treated the viewer with ignorance. They always had a good storyline and were directed, if not with skill, always with passion. Maybe, since the likes of 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th', the contemporary horror fan is more than satisfied with the likes of 'Candyman'. I beg them to watch eg. 'The Black Room (1935), 'Bride of Frankenstein' (1935), 'Don't Look Now' (1973), 'Eyes Without a Face' (1959), 'Frankenstein' (1931), 'Freaks' (1932), 'The Haunting' (1963), 'Mad Love' (1935), 'Revenge of Frankenstein' (1958), to name but some of the horror classics which have more than stood the test of time.In 'Candyman', the expectations which the unfolding of the story present, are so quickly dispensed with to make room for the usual scenes of slasher violence, that it seems pointless that they were bothered with at all. Don't get me wrong, as a horror fan I am not averse to any scenes of gory violence - I just object when they are randomly put in as set-pieces to keep the 4th rate script and narrative moving along.'Candyman' has a glossy exterior, but delivers neither depth or excitement and becomes little more than a 90-minute TV movie.

A grad student and friend investigate the legend and find some tangible evidence of his existence. From there on, we, as the audience, are treated to some plot twists involving Virginia Madsen(as the grad student)seeing Candyman - perhaps in reality that only she is privy to or in her dreams or in some other psychological state. What we do know is that murders take place and Madsen is involved somehow. My take on the film is a somewhat mixed one. As with much of Clive Barker's work(this film is based on his novel The Forbidden), I am always a step behind understanding what is exactly going on. Some viewers don't seem to mind that and even embrace it as some type of genius or something. I must confess I do not. Barker's story definitely has flair and there are many memorable scenes in the movie - many of which will make you take a good jump. Director Bernard Rose is a good director creating some truly innovative and evocative scenes. The Chicago tenements are treated with a most frightening realism. Tony Todd makes a scary bogeyman as he portrays the Candyman. And Madsen does a nice job(with a needless nude scene thrown in just in case you lose interest). But I just found the plot too far out there for me to really enjoy the film. Bees were filled in a toilet seat in a disgusting filthy restroom outside...why? I had lots more questions along that vein. The ending did not match the first three quarters of the film in terms of continuity or realism.

Like A Nightmare On Elm Street before it, it has a supernatural killer from a netherworld who was killed by a mob of people and now comes back to the real world to enact a terrible revenge. However, where Freddie Krueger was a vile paedophile child killer, the Candyman was a black man killed for forming a sexual relationship with a white girl. So, a significant difference is that this is a slasher villain with a genuinely tragic back-story; he is a killer who is at once terrifying and poetic. This is one of the things that makes this film a somewhat unusual one of its type.It has a great sense of place too. The cold-looking Chicago setting is ideal, with the scenes in the projects especially well used. This aspect allows the movie to have an unexpected social-realist angle. The comparison between the squalor of the poor block with the one inhabited by the rich is done in an effective way. The social commentary isn't delivered in a ham-fisted way; it is just part of the story and seems quite natural. But of course this is a slasher film so how does it fare on that level? Well there are a number of gore-drenched scenes and several effective shock moments. The horror part of the film is certainly handled very well and it does have an effective and quite original killer.It has fine production values too. The haunting aerial photography is beautiful, while the score from Philip Glass is very evocative. Acting is universally good. Virginia Madsen as the principal character is great, while Tony Todd as the Candyman provides just the perfect balance of menace and melancholia. Candyman is a slasher film that offers up something different and, dare I say it, has some class. It's a very well executed horror film that also has other things to say as well. It's one of the strongest horror movies from the 1990's.

Based on a story by Clive Barker, director Bernard Rose's creepy tale sees graduate students Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) writing their thesis on Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd), aka Candyman, an affluent black artist brutally supposedly murdered by hired thugs after his lover's father, a powerful businessman, discovered that his daughter was pregnant. According to legend, anyone foolish enough to utter Candyman's name five times whilst looking in a mirror will get to meet the man in person, shortly before being gutted by his vicious hook.Silly sceptic Helen attempts to disprove the Candyman myth, but soon realises that she has made a big mistake Candyman exists because people believe in him, and in order to survive, he must ensure that the stories continue. Helen's suffering will be the stuff of legends for years to come.As one might expect from the mind that brought us the dark delights of Hellraiser, Candyman is an intelligent yet twisted horror tale that successfully manages to disturb on more than on level not only is the physical violence upsetting, with even kids and animals meeting very grisly demises, but the film also manages to play on fears and paranoia buried deep in the common subconscious who hasn't looked in a mirror and been afraid of what they might see lurking behind them?; are crazy people really insane, or do they just see what most of us cannot?; and do we allow superstition to prevent ourselves from making rational decisions?Technically, the film is equally as proficient, with fluid camera-work and stunning art direction making the film a joy to behold, a haunting score by Philip Glass that adds immeasurably to the unsettling atmosphere, and convincing central performances from the talented Madsen as poor Helen, and Todd, whose menacing voice alone ensures chills up and down the spine.And to those people who say that the film lacks a decent ending, I reply 'poppycock!'&#x97;the finale is great Helen reminds Candyman of his long lost love, and so he tricks her into rescuing the baby he has stolen, hoping to finally end his existence in the company of a surrogate family. Instead, Candyman perishes alone, with Helen dying after saving the baby's life. The film ends with Helen replacing Candyman as the subject of urban folklore, appearing to kill whenever her name is repeated in a mirror.

The legend of the Candyman is a potent one around the high-rise tenements of Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing complex, where the residents speak of a dark, ominous figure who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then mercilessly slashes them to death. Upon learning that the Candyman is rumored to live in one of the vacant tenements, a University of Illinois researcher (Virginia Madsen) investigates a recent murder at Cabrini-Green. She learns that the Candyman (played by Tony Todd) is both unreal and chillingly real--a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend. He is a killer made flesh by the belief of others, and the young researcher's investigation is a threat to his existence. What happens next? We wouldn't dare spoil the chills, but rest assured that writer-director Rose has tapped into a wellspring of urban angst and fear, and Candyman serves up its gruesome frights with a refreshing dose of intelligence.

Some hail this as one of the best horror films of the last decade; yet as I watched it, I found myself desperately wanting to like it (as I have liked Barker's uniquely out-there directorial outings), but in the end, could not. Adapter/director Bernard Rose successfully captures the hallucinatory elegance of Barker's text in this tale of a black man murdered for his affair with a white woman at the turn of the 20th century, only to haunt the housing projects of Chicago's Cabrini Green. The notion of personifying an urban legend is pretty clever, yet the Candyman (Tony Todd) comes across as a deep-voiced, hook-handed spouter of nonsensical mumbo jumbo. But the biggest problem lies in Virginia Madsen's character--as the bourgeois wife of an unfaithful college professor (Xander Berkeley), she spends the first hour as an icy, competitive, arrogant, and generally unlikeable human being; by the time she's committed to a mental ward and we actually begin to sympathize with her, the movie is nearly over, and it's simply too little, too late. Regardless of the 'symbolic' juxtaposition of the superstitious, poverty-stricken blacks of the Green against the overly-confident, well-off white population, even horror movies need an anchor we can place our trust in, and no character in Candyman comes close. That being said, the production design is wonderful, and Rose does build some suspense, even if the payoff is never that scary. Try as the producers might, the Candyman never comes close to being an iconic horror character in the 'Universal Monsters' mold (though many sequences directly/indirectly quote the original Frankenstein and Dracula).

On all of those accounts, the film did not disappoint. Unfortunately, though, it rated pretty low on the chill factor. While not an unworthy film in and of itself, as a horror film, well, what's the point if it doesn't in the very least inspire you to double-check if you locked your doors before you can to bed?The plot centers around a Chicago grad student investigating a local urban legend about a supernatural serial killer, summoned through a mirror Bloody Mary style, who is reported to be stalking the projects. The graduate student, Helen, is as cynical as anyone would be, until the myth turns out to be real, and the Candyman (Tony Todd, marvelous) begins unraveling Helen's life and eliminating her loved ones as a very peculiar way of going about seducing her. And as far as dead serial killers go, the Candyman, with powers of hypnotism and a startling, yet not altogether unpleasant, appearance, is surprisingly effective, mingling psychological terrorism and emotional manipulation with tenderness and naked vulnerability.Tony Todd, standing 6'5, with the resonant voice of James Earl Jones and the dignified elegance of Sidney Poitier, lends a poetic beauty and even a deep sense of sympathy to his character, who in his own way is a victim too. The Candyman already knows the pain that he is inflicting upon others, and thus seems just as empathetic as he is vicious. However, this might actually work against his character; instead of dreading his appearance, as Helen does, I actually looked forward to his screen time, and his sad eyes make his character very convincing. (In a way, Todd's physicality has already done half of the work for him.) Instead of relating with Helen's terror, confusion, and growing desperation, I identified with the Candyman's loneliness and hopelessly romantic, brokenhearted spirit. Really, I just felt too sorry for him to be afraid of him.For her part, Virginia Madsen is adept in a somewhat underdeveloped character. She is eminently watchable, and her beautiful, limpid eyes draw you in, even if the plot doesn't. Not that it is a bad plot- it seems that there is potential here that wasn't fully realized, though I'm not quite sure what it is. Perhaps it just failed to tap into my personal fears- some people have told me that they find this film positively terrifying. I believe I would have enjoyed this film more if it had been more the Candyman's story rather than Helen's, if we were allowed to get to know the Candyman as well as we are allowed to get to know Freddie in the first 'Nightmare on Elm Street' film. As we know, the victims and even the heroes of a horror franchise are ultimately disposable; it's the villains that we come back for (as wonderful as Jodie Foster was in 'Silence of the Lambs', it was really Hannibal who ultimately engaged the viewers, not Clarice). Yet there is something to be said that although I considered this a mediocre film, I still plan on watching the sequel, because I was nevertheless left wanting to know more.

The very word horror, charitably interpreted, tells us nothing.  What respectable film would admit to being literally horrific - that is, to inspiring horror, to making people recoil at the sheer hideousness of its images?  If we allow that there are GOOD horror films then we must mean something else by horror.  But what?  Look at the films held up to be among the best the so-called genre has produced - Nosferatu (1922), Dracula (1931), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), Night of the Living Dead (1968), Rosemary's Baby (1968), The Exorcist (1973), Halloween (1978), The Shining (1980) - forgive me for the ones I've missed - and you'll see it's hard to find any two that deserve to be grouped with one another, let alone with the slasher flicks of the 1980s we now regard as typical.  (The exception, of course, is Halloween, which I admit I haven't seen.)At their worst these 1980s slasher flicks are true horror shallow, misanthropic, misogynist and repulsive.  On the surface Candyman looks a lot like them.  The exotic (in this case, supernatural) elements have been drained of all romance.  There's the humdrum, everyday world, then there's the ugly and squalid forces of darkness - and that's ALL there is.  The pessimism would be enough to make you run screaming if you took it too seriously.  (And we take it seriously enough so that when people die, we don't really mourn their passing, since there doesn't seem to be any point in doing so.)  There's a killer that STALKS its victims, toying with them like a cat with a mouse.  And there's an awful lot of blood.  These similarities are enough, I think, to make Candyman the same KIND of thing as Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.But it's the best of that kind.  One reason is that while the forces of darkness toy with the characters, the camera doesn't we are NOT invited to take pleasure in peeking through the curtains at pretty young women just before they get creatively slaughtered.  The central character is an adult woman whose concerns we can take seriously; when she suffers, it has a shattering effect - or at least it did on me.  This is a film that doesn't ask its heroine to go through anything it isn't prepared to ask its audience to go through as well.  And when one of the central characters dies, it lingers (in scenes that are still burnt into my memory) on the consequences, not on the anticipation.This is all in addition to the fact that Candyman is simply a classier production than your average horror flick, with better photography and art direction, a convincing central performance (by Virginia Madsen), and a genuinely chilling musical score (by Phillip Glass, who finds his true niche as a film composer).  The ending - by which I mean the arch twist contained in the last few shots - IS schlocky and misogynist, and only half flows from what went before.  It's best thought of as belonging to some other movie.

(This is not taken to mean that horror films do not have a good storyline but to mean that many do not because the horror and gore is more of the norm.) What 'Candyman' does succeed at is its ability to 'do' horror well. Typically, horror films are not frightening, even when they want to be. In fact, some of them can be downright amusing. 'Candyman' did have its creepy moments. Although I saw this film in my teens (12 or more years ago now), I remember the scene showing how the Candyman character became Candyman through torture by bees / his slave masters. That is really all that I can remember.I must not have thought the film was terribly frightening because I remember repeating his name in the mirror to impress the friend that I watched the movie with. Of course, nothing happened. Despite the creepy factor succeeding, I can only give this film a '2/10' because it is not what I would consider to be a great film, and it is certainly not the best film in this genre.If you are looking for something to creep you out this Halloween, however, this is your film. (Though, I am not sure if it has aged and how creepy it actually is now.)

The only thing pleasant to look at was Virginia Madsen's face and figure. Otherwise, especially if you are petrified of bees, stay away from this Clive Barker-written shocker.This movie is strictly made for shock value, which you get here and there with bloody, gross scenes. Storywise, it's so ludicrous and so full of holes and that urban legend nonsense that only an ignorant Liberal would believe, that it's almost laughable. The race card used in here is an insult. Speaking of laughs, this film could have used some humor. It wasn't well-enough made to take itself so seriously. Some humor would have helped immensely.

The sets are amazing, but the plot is far-reaching, the acting is forced, the gorey scenes go overboard, and the overuse of characters sink this film before it even has a chance. I try not to hate individual films because of the art form's young and tender age, but it's pretty hard not to hate this one. I hated the plot, the gorey sequences, the flashbacks, and the characters. Not to mention that the ground in which this movie walks on is tainted with the run-of-the-mill Nightmare on Elm Street slasher garbage. I profess to my friends, who agree with me, that this was one of the most unnecessary movies ever made. If you are looking for something scary, this terrible movie will scare you, and suck away two hours of your life as well.

This is the real horror of Candyman!Usually, I like to start with the positives, but in this case there are no positives (aside for the brief moments when the Virginia Madsen was bathing in a tub....). Candyman goes from bad, to worse in a descending spiral into cinematographic badness... The whole movie, from the silly urban legend to the filming of it in a housing project is a nightmare, and I mean a nightmare not from a horror movie perspective... The musical score is annoying, to say the least. Phillip Glass is as minimalists as he is repetitive. The interracial love story adds little to the film, the twist ending was as predictable as cold weather in the winter. Acting is so-so. So why do so people rave about it? I do not have the foggiest idea... Maybe people are hypoglycemic, who knows?Maybe it is because it tried to a different, innovative horror movie. But it ended up being pretty boring and lame. Not even the Candyman was scary; he looks like the stereotypical pimp from Starsky and Hutch!Instead of watching this heap of fermented, rotten candy I recommend The Mothman Profecies, which is a movie that deals with an eerie urban legends in a much more entertaining way.

But sometimes we all have to grow up and accept that not everything we loved as a kid was actually worthy of our love. For example, let's say you grew up with a certain stuffed animal, and then you turn 13 and you know it's time to detach yourself from it, but you can't. I know from experience that's how a lot of horror fans are with old slasher films. They watched Candyman when they were 5-years-old, and to this day their biased minds find it greater than anything any new horror film could possibly conceive. They overlook the fact that by today's standards, Candyman is pure cheese. I'm not writing this review for those people. There is nothing whatsoever I can say here that would even slightly change your opinion. I'm writing this highly negative review for the open-minded horror fans out there, who have yet to see this so-called classic.First and foremost, as I said, Candyman is pure, unabashed cheese horror. The first time you see the actual Candyman himself, you'll probably laugh out loud and roll around on the floor like I did. Putting a man in an over-sized fur coat with a cheap plastic hook sticking out one end isn't exactly terrifying stuff, I'm sorry to say. Coming from a horror fan who has actually matured with the times, this is about as scary to me as a walrus with a toy chainsaw. Put simply, the only reason this film is so bad is because it's so cheesy, yet it takes itself as seriously as if it's dealing with something that isn't straight out of a children's cartoon. Don't get me wrong, I very much appreciate the serious tone, but it's downright stupid in this context. It's a film about killer medicine cabinets, folks, not the real-life Holocaust or something.The story is about as generic and uncreative as a horror movie can get. It's a play on the old Bloody Marry myth, and the plot direction takes the same path that has been rehashed countless times in films just like it before. Woman reporter&#151;already a horror cliché and I haven't even gotten through three words of the synopsis&#151;is investigating a murder, she discovers a myth, she researches it, the myth comes to haunt her. Oh man, how original. Do not tell me Candyman started these clichés, because it didn't. This exact plot has been used in everything from 60s horror films to episodes of 80s cartoons. There is nothing creative here. The ending is a rip-off of an old Twilight Zone episode. The movie is so generic and unoriginal, I have nothing more to say about it. Other than it's also boring to the point of nausea.I was never a Clive Baker fan for this exact reason. He's so obsessed with over-the-top, cheesy villains and cliché situations, I find almost everything he's written nearly unreadable. I know this will anger his fans, but, sorry, if there is anyone who I blame for the cheese-horror outbreak, it's him. And Candyman is the single most typical work he's ever done.Is there a single positive thing I can say here? No. I can at least cut some cheese-horror films slack for at least having some creativity (Sleepaway Camp for example), but I can't even do that here. In other words, Candyman is a bland, generic slasher with a laughable villain and unoriginal premise. And I've written this exact review so many times I might as well just save it, change the movie title, and repost it for every 80s and 90s slasher film out there, because no matter how much faith I have there may be at least one slasher that isn't bad, they almost all are. And what's even sadder is that they're almost all acclaimed. Am I really the only one who looks past nostalgia anymore?0/10 "},{"Title":"the worst film i have ever seen.....even the worst genre.....","Date":"21 September 2009","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" the most stupidest film ever made.....am saying this to the director..why can't u go do some other business than film making...please don't waste people's time and money...this goes to all the people who comment on though...guys please stop giving fake ratings to the films which are good for really nothing...you all know that...i literally wasted my precious 1hr 30 minutes on this worst film...we really rely on the comments which were given by the users...please try n make it genuine....this goes to the worst 250...i don't think this even deserves it...worst script.....worst acting....worst everything....

The lead woman (I can't remember her name- she was just THAT good!) goes through the movie doing stupid things. She puts herself in blatantly dangerous situations and then cries like a baby when she's hurt. The Candyman isn't scary at all. Anyway, the hideous acting in the movie (mainly by the main character's idiotic actions) make this movie bad. Oh, the story line wasn't good either. I believe a first grader wrote the script if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, it's been my experience to NOT watch movies where the name Clive Barker appears in the credits. Don't see this for any reason. Completely unrealistic and unimpressive. "}]
