The casting is excellent. I feel that Jim Varney plays an excellent Jed Clampett. I wish there was a sequel when he was still alive. Sadly, he's gone. I think we saw him apart from his Ernest character a lot more in Jed. He seem to feel right at home in this character. Cloris Leachman is a hoot as Granny and I really felt that she enjoyed the role. Erika Leniak does an actually good job as Elly May Clampett. She seems to fit at right home with the role. I liked Diedrich Bader as both Jethro and his twin sister Jethrine. Bader is really an excellent comedic actor. I thought Lily Tomlin played Ms. Jane Hathaway in her own updated style. I felt this Jane had more gusto than Nancy Culp did in the series. Dabney Coleman is always fun to see and in this one as Drysdale. I liked him and Tomlin together. I liked Penny Fuller as Mrs. Drysdale and Kevin O'Connell who plays their son, Morgan. I felt Morgan and Elly could have gotten together. I liked Linda Carlson as Jethro's mother. I wished she was on more. Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson really do a good job as con-artists after the Clampetts. But I really enjoyed watching this film to see the stars like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Miguel Ferrer, Buddy Ebsen as Rockford, Dolly Parton, etc. Their cameos made it worth while to see them. It's nice to see Zsa Zsa poke fun at herself on screen in anything.

But in my opinion, this movie may have helped reintroduce the story of the Beverly Hillbillies to a new audience. I loved it.Plot It all starts when Jed Clampett discovers oil on his property. Then Aunt Pearl convinces him to move to Beverly Hills. What am I saying? Y'all know the story. It's the same story as the TV show. That's one of the best things about this movie; that it stays true to the TV show. In addition, Jed has decided to come to Beverly Hills mainly to get hitched. Now this sounds like a funny story.Cast The actors were probably one of the biggest aspects of the movie. The cast was funny, but also believable. The late Jim Varney (Jed) was great in one of his best non-Ernest roles. Dabney Coleman (Mr. Drysdale) was convincing in his role. He probably got the experience from doing 9 to 5, which also starred his co-star Lily Tomlin. Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider (Laura and Tyler) play two cons who are trying to steal the Clampett fortune. They should've known better than going up against the Clampetts. There were many other great and hilarious performances from stars like Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak, and Diedrich Bader.Humor There was the prefect balance of humor and seriousness in this movie. And the crude humor was low. If there was too much stupid or crude humor, it would've brought down the whole movie. But there was just the right amount of humor, so the movie was good.This one may be a bit too much for the younger viewer, unless it's been edited for a few bad jokes. I recommend this one for anybody who just wants to see a funny movie.

Having lived in the southern US for years, I learned rather quickly that there is a stark distinction between the hillbilly and the American redneck. Hillbillies are more family oriented, while rednecks seem to care more about the toys theyhave and keeping up with Bubba (the southern American version of Keeping Up With the Joneses). Bubba has a rad gun collection; a shiny new truck complete with roll bar, wench and lift kits, mud-flaps and tires large enough to get you out of the mud bog with a truck bed laden with deer carcasses.Frankly, I was amazed at the quality of performance contributed by Mr. Varney. I (as was most of the world) was under the mistaken impression that Ernest was the best this actor had to give. What a grievous error! It is, indeed, unfortunate that Mr. Varney was not to be with us much longer after this attempt. I have missed the Ernest movies, to be honest, but I was also looking forward to another dramatic beneficence from him. This attempt was done with love, executed with a witty tongue-in-cheek delivery, and presented to those who held the series in regard with a more than capable star-studded cast. While the wit was at the expense of a group of people who should be respected for their deep country philosophical ideals and witticisms, so was the series. Frankly, if you didn't like the series, I see no reason to watch and then dog this movie.Cloris Leachman was a joy as Granny. She gave us the same sort of tenacity and spirit as did Irene Ryan. Her performance was delightful in spite of the somewhat small stature of her character.Diedrich Bader's Jethro was cleverly drawn from instinct and heart. Rather than one dumb crack after another, he relied greatly on facial expression as well as physical comedy to entertain his audience; a very wise decision on Bader's behalf considering he is not moron. And as this is his first screen attempt, you will see a strong pattern of characters throughout his career to this point which demonstrates his commitment to perfecting this type of role. Erika Eleniak as Elly May (Playboy model-cum-actress) was the only thing which disappointed me with this production. I believe that she tried and gave her best, but she just wasn't Elly May. I expected to feel that way about Jed or Granny, but not Elly May. Her work here was a bit stiff, in my opinion. I remember that her performance as a Playboy bunny in Under Siege was a little stiff, too. I do not know if her talents as an actress have progressed since this attempt as I've never cared to watch anything else in which she's been featured.Lily Tomlin and Lea Thompson were both dead on their characters. Although Tomlin's character was preconceived and Thompson's was a one-time plot element, they both contributed above-par performances in this work. And, true to the series, there's always some shifty character trying to take the Clampett billion away from Drysdale; enter Rob Schneider. Some critics have stated they did not understand his character's presence in this endeavor, but it fit right in with the theme of the television series. He was entertaining, delivered a good performance, and more importantly...he was funny.Dabney Coleman is Milburn Drysdale in every way, shape and form. He could have been the original participant in the series, as far as I'm concerned. He turned in an impeccable performance here.Although the story line was good, I felt it could have had a little more depth. However, the touching moments between Jed and Elly May appeared to be heart felt and honest, lending a very endearing quality to this production. The most important point I could make here is simply that Jim Varney was (and is) the best thing about this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of his Ernest franchise, you will still enjoy his performance in this movie. This was far superior to his previous performances in any other work.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend .

The difference is that in the first instance the films are based on characters as written down on paper from the mind of it's creator.  No matter how many times A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE is remade it always goes back to the characters, not the actors who portrayed them.  Audiences will keep going back to the same play or film each time it is recast to see the subtle difference the recasting will change the role.  That is why film versions of hit Broadway plays can be so successful.  Remaking a TV sitcom is different.  The new cast is not portraying the characters as originally written, they are portraying the actors' characterizations.  So in films like THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES we are treated to what is essentially a Saturday Night Live style parody.  Of course, some of the best SNL skits are parody and it is fun to watch when done well (impressions done well, and of course a good sense of poking fun at a beloved show).  THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE was perhaps the best example of this.  THE ADDAMS FAMILY was a remake, opting to go back to the original characters as created by Charles Addams in his comic strip.  BATMAN and SUPERMAN also went back to their roots in the comic books and skipped most references to the TV show.  In THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, the characters of Jed Clampett, Granny and the rest of the clan were created by Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, etc...and I really doubt any of the new cast searched out notes of the characters so much as they just reviewed the old shows.  This is all right and in good fun and we have to keep in mind that Jim Varney is not so much playing Jed Clampett as he is playing Buddy Ebsen's Jed Clampett.  Recently, someone went ahead and remade Laurel and Hardy (in which the characters and the actors were one and the same).  It flopped because it wasn't a parody and the film treated the characters as if the original Stan and Ollie were merely players.  THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES does not make this mistake, opting to literally morph the new cast out of our memories of the old cast.  This movie has a cast that is hip, fun, and funny (you got to love a film that boasts a perfect, if not quite obvious casting of Jim Varney, Erika Eleniak, and Lily Tomlin--all giving great comedic performances).  Is it better than the original?  No, and I don't think it was suppose to be.  It was just suppose to be a way to laugh at our past, and perhaps give fans a feeling that they are not alone with their adoration of one of the great TV shows of all time.

Moynahan, Mike Norris....Director Penelope Spheeris, Screenplay Paul Henning, Lawrence Konner, Mark Rosenthal, Jim Staahl, Jim Fisher.Released in 1993 from Director Penelope Spheeris, a female director at a time when there weren't many of them, this was the Beverly Hillbillies movie, based upon the classic 60's comedy. Because more than one writer worked on the script, and because the cast was a pretty talented group of comic actors - Jim Varney (He was the Hey, Vern! guy, Ernest in various comedy films in the 80's) Diedrich Bader (he would be a regular on Drew Carey), Cloris Leachman needs no introduction and neither does Lily Tomlin. Plus, there are cameos by Dolly Parton, Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed Clampett and Zsa Zsa Gabor. The premise is the same, except this time the setting is in the early 90's. Jed Clampett (Varney) discovers oil in his Arkansas mountain home and becomes a millionaire over night. He moves his family - daughter Ellie May (Erika Eleniak), cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) and his elderly grandmother (Cloris Leachman) to Beverly Hills, at a time when it was still hip and elitist, the zip code to billionaires. The Clampetts put their money in the bank of Milburn Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) who becomes their financial planner. Jane Hathaway (Tomlin) becomes their accountant. But another couple - Laura and Woodrow (Leah Thompson and Rob Schneider)have set their sights on taking the Clampett fortune. Laura poses as a French teacher to Ellie May and wins Jed's heart, making him propose marriage. With one click of a computer, she can get his money to her Swiss bank account. Will the Clampetts end up on top ? This movie is entertaining and one of those comedies that require good acting and plot and it's not just visual jokes or tawdry jokes. Few comedies are made like this nowadays but still, Beverly Hillbillies was one of the many good comedy films of the early 90's which saw films like Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead Encino Man and the Ace Ventura Pet Detective films. The film does not contain adult content and the language is not offensive, so it's entertaining for the whole family, but it got a PG-13 rating because some of the jokes go over the heads of smaller children who wouldn't understand.

There is no rocket science here (except of course, for Jethro), just enough flat-out absurdist satire to make me laugh and laugh and laugh. Extremely true to the spirit of the original, this is very well-performed and totally irreverent.  Cloris Leachman, Lily Tomlin, and Elena Ereniak are standouts as Granny, Miss Jane, and Elly Mae, actually improving slightly on the originals which I didn't think possible.  Buddy Ebsen is marvelous in a cameo as Barnaby Jones, and Linda Carlson makes a terrific Cousin Pearl.  Junior Drysdale is also enjoyable. Penny Fuller was very bad as Mrs. Drysdale, but it's a minor role. Dietrich Bader is a great Jethrine, and a fair-to-middling Jethro.But, the real revelation is the late Jim Varney (incredible to think that he is dead for five years while Buddy Ebsen is still with us). I HATE the Ernest movies, and was expecting the worst.  But Varney, actually captured the soul and spirit of Jed Clampett even better than Ebsen if possible.  He is magnificent in the role.

It was brilliantly cast and remained true to both the premise and the spirit of the original.

The show was about a very rural, and country family, who strike oil on there land, become immensely wealthy, and move out to the big city in California. Basically, it was a fish out of water story. However, the problem with this TV to movie adaptation is this What works in a TV show, won't work in a movie. You can't have a movie run on just one premise! A film's plot requires much more than that. The plot of the film is this a sleazy con-man finds out about The Clampett's massive fortune, and he and his girlfriend devise a plan to steal all of their money, and The Clampetts and their friends must stop them. I really don't need to say anything else, because that's all that goes on in this movie. The plot is nothing new, and as a matter of fact, this movie, The Addams Family, and Addams Family Values have the exact same plot! many of the jokes are flat, and unfunny. Not to mention, the film is as predictable as can be. It's a shame how the movie turned out. Especially considering how extremely talented the cast is! Jim Varney, Diedrich Bader, Erika Eleniak, Dabney Coleman, Lea Thompson, and Rob Schneider, all give very good performances. The film fails, because of its weak script, and rehashed plot. Despite all its flaws however, I will give the film a few positive accolades The cameo with Buddy Ebsen (Who was the original Jed Clampett by the way.) was very funny. But most of all, the film did not make a mockery of what the original series was, nor did the film parody the original show. Which many TV- to-film remakes do. I'm very thankful that the writer/writers and director chose not to go with either of those options, and I tip my hat to them for that! So, here's what it all comes down to Is The Beverly Hillbillies a bad film? No. Is it a great film? No. It had a lot of potential to be a great film, but it suffered from very poor writing. The best thing that I can say about this film, is that out of all the recent TV-to-film remakes, this one is the least bad. None of the TV-to-film remakes have ever come close to capturing the spirit or magic of the original series, and this film failed as well, but I must give credit to this film for actually trying.

This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea. (Couldn't resist!) Suddenly rich after he's paid $1 billion for his land, his family tells him that Californy is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars. (Couldn't resist again!)So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves.This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine. You got it in half hour chunks (less counting commercials) and that was enough. Trying to keep it going for over an hour and a half without a break became tiresome after a while.Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect.It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them.

Worrell), I was not surprised. I love the Ernest character and the entire Ernest genre. With Varney being able to pull off a multitude of characters and voices(over 61), I wasn't shocked at his performance as the serious Jed Clampett. It was refreshing to see him play the straight role while the comedy was happening around him. I've always wanted to see Varney in dramatic roles as well and knew he had it in him to do so. Varney was the perfect choice for Jed and no one could've done better. Ebsen should be proud. I must admit, I was so used to seeing Varney as Ernest that I WAS shocked when I saw 'Jed' come down the stairs in a black hat, white shirt and black pants. The first thing I thought was, Weeeee, Doggie. Sexy. I couldn't help myself. I'm from Alabama, and I know that the accents were somewhat forced on some parts like Elly Mae's but Varney's was dead on. Since he was born in Kentucky and lived in Tennessee, how could it not? With Tomlin, Parton and Coleman, it felt like a 9-5 reunion. Bader playing the moronic Jethro cracked me up especially when he 'figured' out how to bowl. Leachman as Granny was perfect. Being such a small little thing, she has a big personality. I remember watching her as the witch in 'Hansel and Gretal' and just loving the performance. Another hilarious scene was how the Clampett's gave everyone on the interstate the bird because they honestly thought that was how people said hello in 'Californy'. One of my favorite parts was when two hooligans come up beside them after being cut off by Jethro, and pull a gun. Jed stands up, points a huge rifle at them and says, That's real nice, son. This here's what I carry. The two guys speed away. I grew up watching some of the reruns of the original 'Beverly Hillbillies'. And the movie is a nice parody of the original, but keeping true to the story and characters. Jim sang a version of 'Hot Rod Lincoln' and it was just excellent. Not only did he had a wonderful singing voice, he was also very articulate. I recommend this movie. If you're a Varney fan then I highly recommend you get this and enjoy!!

Yet with all the negative points of the film, it still manages to come of silly in its own way; it's a bad movie, but not a particularly harmful one, on the other hand.The late Jim Varney plays Jed Clampett, who--as all we all know--discovers some oil out in Arkansas, becomes a millionaire, and moves his family out to Beverly Hills, California. This is the excuse for some half-brained and ultimately stupid gags that sometimes become so bad it's hard to watch, yet make up for themselves when the film starts to make fun of itself.Jim Varney fits Jed pretty well, but too many of the actors and actresses seem forced and the dialogue is reminiscent of a straight-to-television flick written by authors with Writer's Block.Too much of the film borrows from other films we've seen before--and the gags have been done in those films about ten times better. The cast is top-o'-the-notch, co-starring the likes of Lea Thompson, Cloris Leachmen, Dolly Parton, Rob Schneider, Dabney Coleman, and even the real Buddy Ebson in a cameo. But a cameo by Buddy Ebson cannot save a badly written film.There really is no excuse for why this film was so bad. It had a good director, an overall good cast, a good script-writer, some good cameos, and good potential for some parody. But instead it comes off dull, recycled and misused, and ultimately a rehash of everything we've seen before, done in a childish and cartoonish way.So, yes, there are some good parts in the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see them.1.5/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Hot Dog! The Beverly Hillbillies Have Their Own Movie!","Date":"17 November 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS       In the Ozarks in Arkansas lived a backwoods family. There was the patriarch, Jed Clampett who spent his time hunting with his faithful hound dog, Duke. Jed was a poor mountaineer who barely kept his family fed. His daughter, Elly May, spent her time playing with her woodland critters, and Daisy May Granny Moses, Jed's mother in-law, was the hills' doctor. She could cure whatever ailed everyone. Then, one afternoon as Jed was hunting, he aimed and shot at some food, when out of the ground came a bubbling crude. Oil, that is. Black gold. Texas tea! An oil company representative came and told Jed that he was sitting on a gold mine! He was rich! The Clampetts were given two billion dollars, but what to do with it? Cousin Pearl Bodine and her son, Jethro came for Sunday supper and Pearl suggested Jed and his family move out to California where they've got swimming pools and movie stars. Elly wasn't too happy about the move but when Jed decided the move would be good for her because he was going to try to get remarried, so she agreed to it. Jethro would accompany the family so they loaded his bulky old truck and moved to Beverly. Hills that is.         Meanwhile in Beverly Hills, the president of the Commerce Bank, Milburne Drysdale, learned of the Clampetts and was determined to go to great lengths to appease them in every way. He appointed his secretary, Jane Hathaway to go to their mansion to welcome them but when the Clampetts arrive, Hathaway thought they were intruders and called the feds. When they got out of jail, the Clampetts were quick to forgive Miss Hathaway. The Clampetts invited Mr. and Mrs. Drysdale to supper. They ate on the billiard table and used the cues as pot passers. Drysdale had a crooked assistant, Woodrow Tyler, who wanted to get his hands on the Clampett fortune and as soon as he heard that Jed wanted to get married AND needed a tutor for Elly May, he had his fianceé Laura, disguise herself as a French teacher who would teach Elly May ettiquate. Jethro becomes vice president at the bank and spent his time sharpening pencils right down to nubs. Jethro is really something, let me tell you. When Miss Hathaway tried to drive out the front gate and said on the intercom she was trapped in the walls, Jethro heard her voice over the intercom and thought she was trapped in the walls of the house so started punching through them looking for her. Of course, he didn't find her. Jethro then put big-foot tires on his truck, rather than just buy a new car. Mr. Drysdale's son, Morgan, accompanied Elly May to school where she became the best wrestler in school.          Laura began getting close to Jed so he announced there would be a wedding. Tyler arranged it so as soon as Jed and Laura said 'I do', the Clampett fortune would be their's. The Clampetts invited all 100 of their cousins from the Ozarks. Granny discovered Laura and Tyler's plans so they had her committed to an old folks' home where poor Granny was given electric shock treatment. Miss Hathaway to the rescue and, using Jethro's truck, crash the wedding. Laura and Tyler go to jail and the cousins and the Clampetts commence a hoedown. Well now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin. They'd like to thank you folks for kindly stopping in. You're all invited back again to this locality to have a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality.        A pretty good movie. It's funny. It's from Penelope Spheeris who also directed Wayne's World and The Little Rascals. Jim Varney was a good Jed. He's sadly no longer with us. We all know Varney as Ernest P. Worrell, know what I mean? Cloris Leachman is Granny, Dabney Coleman is Mr. Drysdale, Diedrich Bader is Jethro. He's also Jethrine, Erika Elleniak (not half as pretty as Donna Douglas) is Elly May, and Lily Tomlin (she was born to play that role because she so closely resembles Nancy Kulp) is Miss Hathaway. Rob Schneider (Saturday Night Live) is Tyler and Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) is Laura. Also watch for cameos by Dolly Parton, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Buddy Ebsen! This was a pretty good movie, I recommend it for fans of the TV series or people who are not fans of the TV series!-          "},{"Title":"Weeeeeeeeeeell doggies! Jim Varney could actually ACT!","Date":"29 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  This was one I put off seeing for some time, unable to face the prospect of a new cast portraying the Beverly Hillbillies, who had been made immortal by Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan and Company in the 1960's. When I finally saw it &#150; about two years after it came out, I was pleasantly surprised.Since then I have been surprised to hear the movie slammed many times and have been even MORE surprised to realize there are people who dislike the original TV series! The movie DOES have two potential strikes against it. On one hand, classic TV  aficionados like myself have trouble accepting new actors in the familiar and well-loved roles as the Hillbillies and their neighbors. On the other hand, some simply did not like the classic TV show &#150; including a few people I USED to consider friends! (lol)Director Penelope Spheeris, seemingly not the most likely choice to bring the legendary Hillbillies to the big screen, manages to pull off the feat. No, this is not the same cast that we grew up with and, yes, the characters are interpreted slightly different by each actor. Yet, if one can let go of the `That's not Buddy!' syndrome, one can find this a quite amusing and enjoyable film.I have to admit that I did not look closely at the back of the box when renting it. I remembered that Lily Tomlin was in, but had forgotten that Cloris Leachman and Jim Varney were also in it. I kept thinking `I've seen the guy playing Jed somewhere!' It wasn't until the outtakes at the end, when Varney flubbs a line and gives his patented `Hey Vern' looks that I realized it was him! Let it be said that the late Jim Varney &#150; despite the quality of some of his `Ernest' movies &#150; could ACT! Varney proves to be a very human and very believable Jed Clampett. I wish he had received more praise for it.The entire cast is wonderful. The only question I had when first viewing it &#150; and one I have to re-answer each time I see it &#150; is `Was Diedrich Bader an over-the-top dud, or did he do exactly what he set out to do &#150; play someone with the IQ of a hamhock?' I keep coming to the conclusion that Bader succeeded in giving Spheeris what she wanted from the role. It isn't easy playing a total moron. Max Baer, Jr. had his own style as Jethro and was believable and fun to watch. Bader tends to grate on my nerves a bit; maybe he reminds me a tad too much of Jerry Lewis. He was actually funnier as Jethro's twin sister, Jethrine, further supporting my belief that he found the range he wanted for Jethro.Everyone else was outstanding. Dabney Coleman was born to play Milburne Drysdale and fits the role at LEAST as well as Raymond Bailey. Leachman and Tomlin, meanwhile, bring their own styles to the roles of Granny and `Miss Jane' Hathaway. Both are old pros and great comediannes. Leachman has plenty of energy for the Granny role and pulls if off well. Tomlin, meanwhile, turns in one of her best performances as Miss Jane. Rather than trying to mimic the late Nancy Culp, who was a one-of-a-kind, she takes the role and runs with it. This includes some body language and character perks that make Jane Hathaway all her own.Rounding out the cast are Erika Eleniak as Elly May, Rob Schneider as creepy bank employee Woodrow Tyler, Lea Thompson as his scheming girlfriend, Laura Jackson, and Penny Fuller as Mrs. Drysdale, along with Kevin Connolly as the Drysdale's wimpy son, Morgan. Eleniak combines Nordic good looks and athleticism to pull off a role that is probably less natural for her than it was for Donna Douglas. Schneider and Thompson get a large amount of screen time and are very good as the scheming couple. Fuller is quite good as Mrs. Drysdale, while Connolly turns in very good work as Morgan. His stunned reaction when he meets Ellie Mae (having been coerced into befriending the Clampetts' daughter, whom he assumes will be `a real bow wow') is hilarious.One interesting aside &#150; one of the really funny little gags when the film came out, now dates it. When a fight breaks out in the gym at the wealthy prep school Ellie Mae is attending, several girls are primping in the girls' restroom. A cell phone beeps and some dozen or so girls all grab phones, answering `Hello?' We forget how fast the cordless phone phenomenon has grown! Ten years ago it was still a sign of status and/or wealth to carry one around. That ALL the girls had their own phones (no doubt nixed nowadays in most schools' student handbooks) was a cute way of showing just how affluent and spoiled these kids were!One highlight is the surprise guest appearance of Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed, appearing in his other major TV role, Barnaby Jones. This was an inspired idea. Dolly Pardon also has an appearance, as well as Zsa Zsa Gabor, in a hilarious cameo early-on.Overall, I would have to say that Spheeris and her cast capture the essence of the classic sit-com and do justice to the Hillbillies. So go out and rent the movie and have yoreself a heapin' helpin' of their hospitalitee! Hillbilly style!

Of course, I also think Miss Jane Hathaway was classic (Lily Tomlin).  Comparing it to the old TV show, Miss Jane was different.

I'm not really sure though if she was attracted to Jethro on the show, but I also don't really want to know.Bader playing Jethro was classical.  My mother told me how the guy who originally played him on the show also played Jethrine, but he was so big that he didn't really look too much like a woman, just a big busty man.Some classic scenes  When the Clampetts arrive in Beverly Hills, they meet up with a guy who gives them the finger, and they reckon its the California Howdy, and flash it to everyone.

For example, I challenge anyone not to laugh at her Frau Blucher from Young Frankenstein, or Nurse Diesel from High Anxiety, two roles in which her characters are so finely crafted that they transcend the media. While I'm on the subject of slowly fading actors, Ray Milland's role in The Thing With Two Heads is only slightly more ignominious than Cloris's role in Beverly Hillbillies, which is largely comprised of a screaming old woman shaking her fist.Jim Varney proves that he's not just a one-note catch-phrase with a surprisingly good performance as Jed, which almost redeems him from all those stupid Ernest movies.  Diedrich Bader is quite possibly the most irritating man in the world, next to Jim Carrey.  His performance as Jethro consists of a big, stupid, cheese-eating grin.

Even when the show went downhill later on, there was an innocence about it.In the big screen version of The Beverly Hillbies we see such treasures as The Clampetts are in the truck and while driving by a tree, Granny in the rocking chair, gets knocked off the truck onto the road.The Clampetts on a Los Angeles Freeway flipping people off.Granny gets placed in an insane asylum and stoned on God knows what, only to be rescued by Miss Hathaway, in the end we see them crashing Jed's wedding in the Clampett family truck that has somehow been rigged to look like the show vehicle, Bigfoot. Truly awful.The Clampetts kith and kin fly to Californy and there is a rather disgusting scene where the whole family is spitting. Classy.While the original Hillbillies was not Shakespeare by any means, the actors who created these memorable character deserve better that this piece of swill.For some reason I actually paid for a movie ticket to see this schlock fest when it came out in movie theaters. I was appalled that the people around me were laughing their fool heads off. I felt dirty and needed a bath.

Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life rassling with the critters.Pearl Bodine 8/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job.

With the replacement, it came out...exaggerated!)Storyline 6/10 The plot is similar to the plots of the original episodes Jed wants to get hitched so he can have a wife that will raise the rambunctious tomboy Elly to be proper, Elly likes to rassle, swim in the cement pond with her critters, and climb trees, Jethro tries to be a Hollywood bachelor, Drysdale, aided by his *faithful* secretary, struggle to keep the Clampett account safe in the Commerce bank, and con-men of all sorts try every means possible to swindle money out of the Clampetts, all the while being unknowingly foiled by the Clueless, Trusting Clampetts. The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's/70's.

Places and people like those in Andy Griffith and the Hillbillies were not foreign to me.  I also enjoyed the shows that were more midwestern, such as Petticoat Junction and, especially, the funniest show ever, Green Acres.  When all these shows were axed, television lost the gentle edge it maintained for most of the country and pandered to city slickers who'd never seen a tree.  In the north and in cities, where most executives lived, may have been epitomized by the brash crowd of Archie Bunker and Maude, but the new urban, rabid charicatures elbowed out of their way the last fully centered and genuinely content television character, Jed Clampett (Andy Griffith already having abandoned Mayberry).The Beverly Hillbillies is a show often misunderstood.  It did not consist of a single joke, but of two; and it played variations on those themes for nearly ten years, like a decade-long fugue.  First, the obvious joke, that the hillbillies, not having had access to cultural changes, could not identify anything modern and often put the most egregious misconstructions on everything they found in the city.  The other joke, and the better one for we country folk, was the fact that, though they didn't know what anything was, they had a wealth of common sense that the city slickers lacked.  Jed Clampett was the voice of reason and sensibility, a solid citizen, respectful and religious.  The Hillbillies were not trash.  Jed always wore what he called his best suit;  the fact that it was bedraggled was not his fault, it was simply the best he could afford before striking oil.  He was a gentleman, the epitome of what Americans had always seen as their earliest pioneer heroes.  Coming into millions did not change him. He had no conception of the money he possessed and had no greed for it.  He knew himself, and remained himself, both modest and proud, like so many southerners I knew, and, most of all, balanced.  Although psychologists were often sicced on the Clampetts, Jed never had need of one.  It was the psychologists, unable to comprehend someone so perfectly balanced, who came off as crazy.The rest of the clan were respectful and pious in their own way.  Granny was as likely to sing hymns as to fill someone's backside with buckshot.  She was like many self-sufficient southern women I knew  women who had never heard of feminism,  but who managed to look after themselves and were either self-sufficient or kept up with their menfolk with more calm, more industry, and better sense than Mary Richards trying to worm her fragile way into a man's world.  Just because someone had time-tested values did not mean they fit into some feminist dystopian stereotype.  Strong, steady, self-supporting women were common where I grew up.The movie misunderstands the characters, and the show.  The Clampetts in the series were not stupid . . . oh, yes, Jethro Bodine was stupid, and he had no excuse because he had been to school through the sixth grade (it may perhaps have been a subtle satire on education vs. common sense). Diedrich Bader plays Jethro with aplomb, not as husky as Max Baer but dense and likeable.  Linda Carlson, mimicking Bea Benaderet, comes off quite well as Pearl Bodine.  His character might well have represented the pitiful state of American elementary education.Apart from the Bodines, everything starts to unravel.  Chloris Leachman is a dead ringer for the wonderful Irene Ryan, the funniest woman ever on television, but lacks Ryan's sincerity.  Playboy model Erika Eleniak manages to keep her clothes on for a suitable Elly Mae.  The late Jim Varney, however, is totally out of place as Jed Clampett.  He doesn't come off strong and centered as Buddy Ebsen.  He's simply wrong for the part.Some indications of their respectfulness remains.  When Jane Hathaway's briefcase flies open on the street, both billionaire Jed and nephew Jethro rush to help her pick up her spilled papers, something southerns of my era and before would do automatically.  There are other indications that the Clampetts (and Jethro, but not necessarily his social-climbing mother) are kind and decent people.  But what should be accentuated was the contrast of good-heartedness and reason in an urban setting of greed and self-serving.But missed opportunities apart, the humor employed in this movie was often unconscionably coarse, as when Jethro drives into an outhouse with Granny inside;  and her subsequent chasing him while hitching up her bloomers.Rather than relying on silliness and dumb sound effects, directed at people who have the lowest grade of intelligence, the movie should've taken its characters and themes should've been taken seriously.  It might've been a solid, perhaps Swiftian, satire, on the rapid-paced, rude, greedy modern world we've boxed ourselves into.  Instead, the slower-paced hill folk are as silly as the city folk, perhaps more so.  I suppose superior Hollywood types who think of the country as a place to be developed can't comprehend what they've lost in the urban homogenizing and coarsening of the U.S., particularly as an unfortunate by-product of television.Whatever went through the film-makers'  minds, The Beverly Hillbillies was a travesty of the show and its characters.  Even without reference to the television show, the movie is bad and unfunny.  The only possible reason to see it is for nostalgia, and they cannot expect nostalgia to work if they so flagrantly betray their source material.

Jed packs up his family and heads out for the lifestyle that he can now afford in Beverly Hills. His new bank manager, Milburn Drysdale expects his new billionaire clients to be the height of breeding and sophistication and is surprised to find that although the Clampetts are salt of the earth people, they aren't really Beverly Hills material.One of countless remakes of TV series of yesteryear, this basic, bland and unfunny affair is probably no better or worse than the average television show original but where that has the benefit of nostalgia to strengthen it, this film is left totally exposed in the cold light of modern American cinema. Without this protection the film must stand on its own thanks to a slick narrative, lots of laughs and so on. Sadly the makers seem to have forgotten this and the plot is a predictable and forced narrative along the lines of little people makin' good. I wanted to care about Jed's search for a wife, or worry about whether he would have his money scammed away, or hope that Elly May can be allowed to be herself but really I couldn't bring myself to give a monkey's at any point. A bit of a problem when it then comes to following a story but then, hey, at least I'll be laughing too hard to care about the detail.Well, not really. The comedy here is very basic and seems happy to just rely totally on how stupid Jethro is; how tomboyish Elly is; how old Granny is and how everyone else either slaps their forehead with frustration at these characteristics or just do pratfalls over furniture. Attempts at postmodernism are mostly very lazy and lack any inspiration or genuine wit. It might appeal to children but it was all too little for me. The cast aren't able to help much but in fairness several of them are used to operating at this level. The late Varney is actually pretty restrained but this doesn't mean he is funny or produces a good character &#150; because he can't. However he looks like Lawrence Olivier next to the mugging ineptitude of Bader, who seems to have been told that looking confused with a big stupid smile on your face will produce the type of comedy gold that will stand for all time. He is terrible of course but I do know he is only following direction. Eleniak is a tomboy, and that's about it &#150; she never convinces but then so what? Leachman is told to be old and indeed she is, Schneider is bad even by his standards; Thompson's performance makes Allo, Allo look like an Open University programme and Coleman clearly needs cash and needs it now (or then I suppose). Tomlin is very out of place but at least she seems to be having fun with it &#150; I'm glad one of us was.Overall then, for those who want to watch old television comedies without the blinkers of nostalgia then this is one good way because it exposes the film for what it is &#150; a poorly developed unfunny comedy. Nobody in it can raise the material and instead they are pulled down with it like so many pilots in a nose-diving aircraft; I guess the only difference is that the pilots would be struggling to pull out of the dive whereas here the cast mostly seem blissfully happy to mug along as it spirals ever downwards. A pointless 90 minutes of my evening that gave me nothing back in return for my investment. "},{"Title":"Just As Empty and Unwanted As the Television Series.","Date":"23 May 2002","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  Yuck. The Beverly Hillbillies is one of those movies you pray will never be made, but hey it was the 1990s and television remakes were everywhere. This film is just plain bad and stupid as Jim Varney, Cloris Leachman, Diedrich Bader and Erika Eleniak star as the titled characters that strike it rich in oil and decide to move to Beverly Hills. Of course there is Rob Schneider and girlfriend Lea Thompson who want to take the riches and feel they can from the dim-witted family. Naturally banker Dabney Coleman and top assistant Lily Tomlin hold their breaths in the hopes that Varney and company won't do any stupid things. Don't hold your breath waiting for this film to end. Just avoid watching. 2 stars out of 5.  "}]
