[{"Title":"The most under-rated movie ever ?","Date":"26 December 2005","Score":"273 out of 320 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" Firstly this is an adult movie. I remember when it was marketed on its release. It seemed to be targeted to all ages - Robin Williams off the back of- at that time- children's movies. It promoted the technology of the making. Overall they marketed it completely wrong, which I daresay has led it to being placed in the mediocrity bin.However, nothing could be further from the truth. What Dreams May Come would have to be one of the most intelligent, emotional, visually beautiful, and well acted projects ever to grace the screen.Robin Williams is masterful and Sciorra perfectly mirrors her soul mate (Williams). Their performances encapsulate all the joy and abject sorrow human life entails. It's a movie that wants you to find real love, see beyond cynicism and grasp the idea of soul mate. And it's all presented in a stunningly gorgeous montage of exquisite colour and symmetry.From the opening shot to the closing frame, its magnificent. The story is enveloping encompassing nearly every asset of human emotion. It's a roller-coaster ride but rewarding. Comedy, hope, sadness, joy, elation, despair... all displayed perfectly.ALL actors shine, Cuba Gooding Jr is his usual excellent self and Max von Sydow is impeccable.The greatest movie ever? close... most under-rated movie ever? - most probably. Watch it, very few movies will touch you as What Dreams May Come will.

Period. Before I saw it, I was one of the many movie going clones who decided not to see it in the theater because it hadn't been getting the rave reviews that the trailer suggested it should.So, my roommate works at a video store. One night, he brings home What Dreams May Come. For lack of NOTHING better to do, I pop it in one night when I'm home alone. 113 minutes later I was floored. This was a fantastic movie. At first, I was a bit skeptical. Very little character development creation, and death comes just as the introduction to life begins. Then......it all hits. The absolute best computer animation I've ever seen. A plot line that has no obvious holes. A story that has never been addressed on the big screen. A subject that is explored in a way that is both believable and desirable. An incredible movie that leaves you happy, sad, curious, and most of all, drained of energy and exhilarated at the same time. I can't explain the feeling that this movie gave me, and I bet you can't explain the after-life any better than What Dreams May Come, unless your 3 letter name begins with G and ends with D. If you have a mind that will allow you to be entertained by something other than a beefy guy blowing things up with an Uzi, see this movie. 10 out of 10 JimmyT-2 "},{"Title":"What dreams are made of...","Date":"14 April 2000","Score":"191 out of 225 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  To hell with the critics and the cynics.

I have to admit, I'm one of those non- (almost anti-) elitist, I don't know art, but I know what I like type people.  I also truly love positive, upbeat movies with happy endings.  Not to say that realistic movies aren't also great, but there is room for everything in the moviemaking genre.  Isn't there enough depressing realism on the evening news to satisfy even the most jaded cynic?I can't say exactly what it is that strikes me about this movie.  The incredible color-saturated visuals and special effects certainly help.  The acting talents of Robin Williams and Max Von Sydow help.   And I loved the story.  Emotionally manipulative it may be, but this is one of those films where I WANTED to be manipulated, where I willingly participated.  Apparently some people resented it, but I was sobbing through much the movie, and glad to be doing so.  Laugh if you please, say whatever you want... this movie touches my heart.Deep it isn't, not terribly.  On a metaphysical level, it goes only slightly beyond new-age kitsch.  Very few of the afterlife scenes and concepts agree with the spiritual outlook of any known religion.  But I don't care.

Even though I knew how it was going to end, I kept cheering for it to happen. An absolutely beautiful film. Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) are husband and wife. They met by chance and fell in love immediately. They have two wonderful kids and a marriage full of love and life. But tragically, one day their kids are taken from them in a car accident. They fight to continue their lives, but one day, four years later, Chris's life is also taken. He ends up in Heaven, but can't accept his fate. A guide is sent to him, in the form of his friend Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Albert leads Chris on a journey through Heaven, and the wonders it can bring. In the real world, Annie can't handle Chris's death, and she kills herself and ends up in Hell. Chris must go on a journey to find her, and save her from an eternity of sorrow.This movie hits all the right chords. It makes you laugh at times, and makes you cry at times. The love Chris has for Annie is stronger than anything you have ever seen. He's willing to lose his mind, and spend all eternity in Hell with her, with neither of them recognizing the other, because they are soul mates, destined to be together for all time. This movie is hard to explain in any other way. The journey Chris goes through is remarkable, but the real star of this film is the visuals. When Chris goes to Heaven, he is told that what he sees is what his mind can create. So what he sees is himself inside Annie's paintings. He lives in a Heaven full of brilliant colors. Life in a painting. It was amazing to look at. And the colors of the movie, along with the set designs were incredible. His house, Annie's Hell, the sea of Faces. I just couldn't believe how fantastic everything looked in this movie. The performances were wonderful. Robin Williams was at his dramatic best, and Cuba Gooding Jr. brought energy to the film. The story was strong, if predictable, and the manner is which it was made (utilizing flashbacks) was powerful. You really felt the characters emotions throughout. I know this review is weak, but I really don't know what else to say. I guess you're going to have to see for yourself. It doesn't matter if you don't believe in a Heaven or a Hell. What Dreams May Come will make you believe in something even more powerful than that. Love, and what one man will do because of it.

But he was adequate in this movie, because it called for a real sensitive and really nice guy. I feel that, from almost every one of the actors, there was a luminous glow emanating from their faces, like there was some sort of special lighting used. (There probably was!) As a result, the audience has empathy toward the characters and actually cares about what is happening to them. I've heard so many complaints about how it tries to pull at your heartstrings. Excuse me, but if there WAS a movie out there that made people cry without trying to, I would stay as far away from it as possible........YES, I believe there IS merit to be deserved by a movie if it creates any kind of obvious emotion. I think that crying at a movie either scares or annoys some people.          I like how the movie made me feel awed during the first half, and even more awed during the second half; all the while making me feel sad throughout the movie at the same time. However, there is a difference between 'sad' and 'depressing'. I think the sadness helps any audience realize some parts of their inner-selves.  While very memorable, curiously, the movie never intends for its audience to be close-minded enough to think that this is, with certainty, what happens after you die. It is more of a suggestion, an analogy, of how precious life is, and how deep the bond of love is between some people, no matter what happens. Rent this one today.

This was the first serious movie I saw featuring Williams, and I was amazed. I had thought Williams would be the type who could only act decently in comedies, but this one proved me wrong. He can put down a serious character with all ease not only that, he can truly touch you with his oh so tear-jerking lines.My conclusion if you are planning on watching this movie, keep your tissues at hand, and some food and drinks as well since the movie isn't exactly what you call short.

Then there was a mercifully high-speed review of a perfect family forming, only to be interrupted by the central tragedies of the children's deaths soon followed by that of the husband (Robin Williams). All of which, in the absence of any substantial character development, would have left us cold - if it weren't for the sentimental speeches and over-blown musical score which heralded and underlined every essential moment of the film.In heaven the rot really set in, with overblown special effects and surging symphonic passages trying hard to overcome the zero story-line.  After much traipsing through the flowers of paradise's imaginary pallet we reached the nub of the story with the earthly suicide of the wife.At last, a good 45 minutes into the film, the plot emerged an old fashioned search and rescue mission set in cyber-heaven.  But what a miserable mission a search emasculated of any dramatic tension by the fact that the protagonist is already dead (but living well in paradise) - so what has he to lose?  what threat has to be survived?  It's a case of have Robin Williams, will travel on a tour through a bizarre series of sets and special effects, including Hell dressed up as a burning boat (was this something picked up from Titanic's cutting room floor?)  And a rescue so bland and predictable that it wilted on the flacid vine; and the resultant reunification of family was as cloying and sick-making as the cheapest brand of ersatz champagne.OK so there were a few stunning images that brought to mind Terry Gilliam's work (although without the wit or bite), but these didn't compensate for the crass dialogue and laboured direction.  In any event, they were undermined by some sinister undertones in the film.   Such as the large proportion of black people inside the burning gates of Hell contrasting with the white faces in Heaven; and the idea that suicide is in all cases irredeemable, but for the rest of us there is a better life to be had after we are dead.So sorry to all of you who thought this was such a great film - for me it was drivel of the worst kind a simple story dumbed down and painted up - a thin (very thin) veneer of eye candy and nothing more.

Normally this would bother me because I would automatically assume that I had missed something. But this was one of those occasions where I knew it wasn't me, it was the convoluted screenplay.I will not use the name D---e, the poet, in this review. That would be immoral. I think this film must have been a dare. Someone must have said to Ron Bass, Ron, just how emotionally manipulative can you be? And Ron said, Well, I think you'd be surprised. Then the producers went out and got Robin Williams, and told him that they would pay him per pound of tears, with an extra bonus for every molar he showed us when he smiled. And fresh off his Jerry Maguire success, Cuba Gooding Jr. decided he liked oblivion more than his new-found celebrity, and set out to see just how quickly he can destroy his fledgling movie career. And what was Max von Sydow doing in this? Is he doing infomercials on the side too?Then to impress those viewers, who, upon seeing anything resembling art in a movie say, Two thumbs up! A moving masterpiece! they spent millions on computer graphics that, frankly, looked pretty lame. And they were the highlight of this....film.This was like Club Med for the dead. A trip through the afterlife for all those spiritually eclectic people who venerate religious tolerance, tolerance, as GK Chesterton said, being the virtue of people who don't believe in anything. It's the post-modern democratic version of hell. You go there if you have sacrificed puppies to Hecate. And if that is what heaven and hell look like, I'm living forever man. No hoop skirts and bicycles for me.It is amazing to me what depths movie-makers will stoop to. What is even more amazing is how the American public allows itself to be manipulated. Yes, this is just a movie. But the art which we praise says so much about who we are and where our culture is headed. I am ashamed to live in a culture that thinks films like this are praiseworthy. So, I guess I can't live here, and I can't inhabit the afterlife either. Oh yes, Robin Williams never defiled Purgatory. Figures. Water down the extremes, and leave the middle ground alone.

Sitting through New Zealand director Vincent Ward's visually arresting but histrionic New Age allegory about life, death, suicide, and reincarnation is like going to Hell, too. What Dreams May Come derives its title from William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but prolific science fiction & fantasy writer Richard Matheson penned the actual novel. No, I haven't perused Matheson's novel, but people have reliably assured me that the movie pales in comparison with its literary source. An earlier and more successful Matheson novel Bid Time Return became the cult romance classic Somewhere in Time with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.Kiddie friendly pediatrician Chris Nelsen (Robin Williams) and his gifted artist wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra of Jungle Fever) are soul mates. Nothing can separate them! Dreams repeats this theme ad nauseam so that its ludicrously lackadaisical ending comes as no revelation. Meeting in their youth on a serene lake in Switzerland, they court in the scenic Alps. Life blesses them. Residing in a palatial home, they raise two adorable teenagers, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks), along with a rambunctious Dalmatian. Chris enjoys a successful practice as a doctor, while Annie doubles not only as an artist but also as an art gallery curator.During the opening expository scenes, Dreams bathes audiences in the warm radiance that wreathes the Nielsen home. Predictably, the good times prove ephemeral. Less than twenty minutes into the action, an off-screen auto accident claims the lives of both Ian and Marie. A few scenes later (four years in story time), Chris dies in a spectacular on-screen accident. Initially, Chris refuses to believe that he has kicked the bucket. After all, Chris is walking on Earth as the living do, and he appears none the worse for all his wear and tear. Audiences know better, however, because they see his heavily bandaged body from several high angle shots that suggest his spirit has blown town. Chris eavesdrops on his own funeral. He struggles to console his grief-stricken wife. Eventually, his fuzzy-looking spiritual guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), convinces Chris that he can do Annie no good by lingering. Every time that Chris achieves a breakthrough with Annie, she collapses in tears and recriminations. Frustrated, Chris gives up the Ghost routine.Meanwhile, Annie's condition steadily deteriorates. She holds herself responsible for the accidental deaths of both her children and Chris. She let their housekeeper drive Ian and Marie to school the day of their fatal accident because she was too busy with her career. Later, she dispatched Chris to get some paintings for an upcoming gallery exhibit which she couldn't fetch because she was feeling poorly. Colliding with death in a traffic-clogged tunnel, Chris dies playing Good Samaritan to a woman trapped in a wrecked car. After Chris's funeral, Annie considers suicide. Nothing can console her, not even the diary that her therapist has made her compile to deal with her grief and guilt.Veteran scenarist Ronald Bass adapted Dreams. Usually, he knows what constitutes a worthwhile weepie. His impressive credits include Waiting to Exhale, When a Man Loves a Woman, and How Stella Got Her Groove Back. Sadly, Bass's skills abandon him in this overblown, love-conquerors-all melodrama riddled with chaos, contrivance, and a conspicuous lack of coherence. Neither Bass nor Ward focuses enough time on the Nielson family as a unit to make them seem sympathetic or charismatic. Cluttered incomprehensibly with flashbacks which come and go in fits and starts, Dreams generates wholesale confusion. Ward and Bass shuttle audiences incessantly between the present and the past as well as Heaven and Hell. Not only do they weave a tangled tale, but they also play musical chairs with their characters. The characters aren't so much individuals as they are puppets that stand for ideas.Despite all of this rampant confusion, Dreams conjures up some of the most phantasmagorical imagery that any movie has ever offered. Lenser Eduardo Serra of Blood Diamond and production designer Eugenio Zanetti of Flatliners deserve Oscars for their sterling efforts. Even when Dreams is boring, the LSD scenery is powerful. Hell resembles a conventional synthesis of Dante's Inferno and the art of Dutch painter Hieronymous Bosch.A miscast Robin Williams does a mediocre Kevin Kline impersonation. Worse, reverting to his usual comic antics, Williams cracks giddy jokes that clash with more than compliment this metaphysical melodrama. Sciorra suffers from a string of bad hair scenes. Williams and Sciorra both play characters that reinforce sexist, one-dimensional stereotypes. Chris braves Hades as the never-say-die husband hero, while Annie epitomizes the hysterical damsel-in-distress. Dreams represents Sciorra's first role after an absence of some years. Too bad that she chose to grace this poster-art pabulum to stage a comeback.Only mahogany-faced Max Von Sydow of Flash Gordon emerges with his reputation intact. Cast as 'the Tracker,' he escorts Chris through Hades to find Annie. Sydow wears an outfit that combines Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name with Charon, the ferryman of Greek mythology who steers the dead to Hades over the river Styx. Meanwhile, Cuba Gooding Jr. brings good cheer to a role that qualifies as strictly secondary.What Dreams May Come makes the after-life appear alluring. Admirably, the filmmakers treat suicide as a big no-no. Horribly, they do a soft shoe where morality is concerned. In granting amnesty to Sciorra's suicidal character, Dreams suggests that life and death are not altogether terminal states of consciousness. The theology of Dreams stirs Greek mythology, New Age religion, and Judeo-Christian traditions into a thick soup that shouldn't offend anybody except die-hard fundamentalists. Although thematically ambitious and visually spectacular, What Dreams May Come degenerates into a sluggish, schmaltzy, tear-jerker whose happy ending is hopeless manipulative.

The story revolves around his attempts to reach out to his wife both before and after her own death. Unfortunately this story gets put on hold for long periods so that we can see them portrayed as giggling idiots during their courtship; and then so the director can explore various visual tricks; and then again to insult the audience with pointless plot twists where character A actually turns out to be B.

Who really knows what Heaven and Hell look like? However, these are fairly acceptable images to more people than I. The cinematography in What Dreams May Come is exquisite; the usage of brilliant blues, to me, gives the viewer hope. The score was certainly appropriate for whatever was happening on-screen. I always look at the credits to see how many stunts were used. This film has hundreds - the sheer number of behind-the-scenes crew is staggering. One wonders if that cost were ever recuperated.Robin Williams (Chris Nielsen) was stellar in his interpretation and gave an awe-inspiring performance. Every nuance was appropriate, from sadness to happiness. His portrayal of his character was beautiful and inspiring in that it showed he was willing to stay in Hell forever, just to be with his beloved wife. The scene of his telling her he wanted a divorce - and her reaction - was heartbreaking, and certainly provides their decision to be reborn.Cuba Gooding, Jr (Albert Lewis, Josh Paddock) was wonderful in his role as angel-son. Gooding always is a marvel in the roles he chooses and certainly scored in this film. Annabella Sciorra (Annie Nielsen) was superb; her eyes conveyed every emotion convincingly. Max von Sydow (The Tracker) was frightening, but willing to show Chris the way to Hell. The sets in this episode were astounding, but dread through-out but also with touches of hope with a little blue. Rosalind Chao (Leona) gave another stunning performance....one could see that she was Marie Nielsen (Jessia Brooks Nelson and felt Chris' heartbreak.Although the film is long, the viewer is drawn-into it. As many have written, don't be afraid to become consumed by this movie. You have to witness and participate to really understand and enjoy it. I don't think I'd like to see the different ending presented on DVD - the film is perfect as I saw it. Bravo!-brava! to all, even the least contributor to this astounding movie.

Then my husband and I started watching the movie.  Now, we knew it was going to be sad from reading the back of the video box (we didn't get to make it to the theatre unfortunately...I WISH we'd seen this on the big screen!!!)...but we weren't quite expecting how absolutely beautiful this movie was going to be.  The colors in this movie were absolutely gorgeous!  Even the scenery reached out from the television screen and grabbed not only our attentions but our hearts as well.  They were symbolic to the core.I don't want to give away the plot, but let us suffice to say that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were beautifully cast in this movie about soul mates and how the Afterlife works.  I never thought I'd find my beliefs about reincarnation and the Afterlife portrayed in a movie, but this one managed to catch just about every single thing I believe in.  It confirmed my idea of soul mates and about love lasting beyond till death do you part.And was it emotional!  I said before that we knew it was going to be sad. But even the happy scenes made us reach for the box of tissues.  I cried when things were sad and I cried when things were happy.  That was because when things hit a happy moment, they weren't just happy...they were JOYOUS!  They were moments of complete exultation that I wanted to just leap through the screen and celebrate with the characters.  Those scenes of joy and happiness reached out from the television screen and grabbed my heart and squeezed so hard that I thought I would burst!  I never felt so happy from a movie in my life.  This was not a comedic happy either...although this movie did have its funny lines and moments.  It was a happiness from being aware of life and from knowing the joys of true love and soul bonding. It was a remarkable feeling.I recommend this movie to anyone.  If you've lost someone, see this because it offers a beautiful picture of what the better place is that they've gone on to.  It doesn't subscribe to any particular belief system at all. You don't have to be of any specific religion to enjoy this film at all. In fact, if anything, it offers the peace and harmony to strive for despite all our outward differences.  And it shows that heaven is what you make of it.I've rarely EVER rated a movie a complete 10 or complete 100 or whatever the number may be on a rating scale.  But this one is absolutely perfect.  I intend to see it again and again, and as soon as possible, I'm adding this to our movie collection!

Even Titanic with its epic length at least kept me awake, although I felt it to be just as sappy.  The director created a visually impressive movie that fell short on acting and storyline.  Much of the dialogue seems redundant and is delivered in an unconvincing manner that fails to match the intensity of the visuals.  I just got back from seeing it and I can't remember one good line from the film.  The film is also disappointing in that it misses the opportunity to explore controversial issues surrounding the afterlife.  They conveniently side-step the question of whether or not this is the Christian version of heaven after they explicitly outline reasons for being sent to hell.  Cerberus from Greek lore is also mentioned as guarding the entrance to hell (not Hades)  which further smears the continuity of the film.  Perhaps they didn't want to offend any particular belief by neglecting to give an honorable mention---even a dog gets into heaven (I thought they weren't allowed in). Many reviews I've read claim that it is a deep and thought provoking movie with much merit.   Perhaps I slept through those parts.

This one was a refreshing break. It was a little different than any movie I've seen in the recent past and am likely to see in the near future.The premise behind the movie is that if you die, your soul goes to a a spirit world where your desires are translated to reality. However, those who commit suicide are doomed to keep wallowing in the same misery that drove them to suicide in the first place.Williams portrays a man who has lost his children, and 4 years later, himself is killed in a car accident. He discovers the delightful world of life after death. He soon learns that his widow (played by Sciorra, who you may recognize if you caught the excellent psychological thriller Whispers in the Dark) has committed suicide and is doomed to eternal despair. Williams sets out to save his wife from this fate, which he is told that no one has ever done before.It seems like a little more work on the screenplay might have helped the movie over the top. The performances Williams and Sciorra turn in are sincere, but it seems like the lines could have been better written. The beginning of the movie seems a little rushed, and the same plot device (no spoilers here) is used regarding three different characters from Chris' (Williams) life the scene with his daughter goes off well, but the same technique wears thin the third time around. Finally, it seems as if the climactic scene could have been made more poignant and powerful than it was.Still, if you are looking for a movie that isn't cut from the same mold as so many other recent movies, this may be the ticket.

In this movie, people do not go to Hell because they are evil, but because they got confused and committed suicide. When Annie kills herself, she is trapped in Hell by her confusion. Her husband Chris manages to rescue her, but all the other suicides remain in Hell for eternity. Too bad for them.Anyway, Chris and Annie make it to Heaven where they are safe. But Chris suggests that they be reincarnated so that they can experience life again. Of course, that means taking a chance of becoming confused, committing suicide, and going to Hell, with little likelihood of there being another rescue. Who in his right mind would chance it? But the idea is that life is so wonderful that it is even better than Heaven, even worth the risk of committing suicide and being eternally damned.Of course, that wonderful life involves such things as having your children die in a car accident, having the marriage deteriorate to the point of almost getting a divorce, and then having a husband die in an accident. Who wouldn't want the chance to experience something like that again? Who wouldn't forgo Heaven and risk Hell to experience such misery and suffering once more?

While fleeing from Aristaeus (son of Apollo), she strode on a serpent and was bitten, which brought her to her death. Distraught, Orpheus played such sad songs and sang so mournfully that all the nymphs and gods wept and gave him advice. Orpheus went down to the lower world and by his music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone (the only person to ever do so), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth. But the condition was attached that he should walk in front of her and not look back until he had reached the upper world. In his anxiety he broke his promise, and Eurydice vanished again from his sight. The story in this form belongs to the time of Virgil, who first introduces the name of Aristaeus. Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld; according to Plato, the infernal gods only presented an apparition of Eurydice to him.

The 16th century Spanish painting, a triptych composed of scenes of heaven, earth and hell, provide a structure for the plot that is loosely based on the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus venturing into Hades to return his wife from the afterlife.These classical references had me anticipating a thought provoking allegorical exploration of the consequences of human mortality. But what was delivered was tediously pretentious crap dressed up as sophisticated discourse. Make no mistake, although this film is dark at times and not for children, it is whispy vacuous crap. This is cotton candy spirituality made for dunderhead housewives who want to believe and their rat race husband-drones they've dragged into this shallow affirmation of nuclear family love.The biggest philosophical plot hole here is in the idea that you're more than the sum of your body parts, therefore this godless afterlife must be real. Sorry there, new age consumers, but consider how physical brain damage affects mental abilities, and you'll realise you have no consciousness outside of your brain/body. Spiritualism is bunk.Not to dwell on the metaphysical failures of this film, there's also the fact that the protagonist is literally Robin Williams. That is, Robin Williams in yet another Robin Williams role as Dr. Nice Guy with his quirky one liners, over orchestrated moments of sad face and feel good resolutions. I can only speculate as to how much the film was dumbed down to appeal to the star's typical target audience, but there was definitely potential lost here. Also, what was with the trans-racial spiritual reincarnation of his white children as a Black guy and an Asian woman? Was it really just to make heaven more ethnically diverse for wider audience appeal? Who knows.That said, if you're into fuzzy feel good adult dramas, and are curious for a taste of something that seems arty and deep, but nothing that will mentally challenge you, then dive right in to What Dreams May Come and swallow up the oily slop within.

Subsequently, we see their lives together and then the tragedies that befall them. First, their children die in a crash and then the husband, Chris (Williams), during an accident in a tunnel. He gets transported to the afterlife, which turns out less to be a strict affair, and more personally controlled, his vision adopting the form of his wife's (Sciorra) paintings. However, the pain is too much, and she commits suicide, which traps her in a more personal 'Hell' that Chris must, against all odds, save her from.Often seen as part of the 'Sap Years' for Williams (along with the likes of Bicentennial Man, Jakob the Liar and Patch Adams), What Dreams May come is both the most ambitious, yet also maybe the most frustrating, of the lot. There is genius locked within, but there are major snags; it has a really weak opening in Switzerland, with some of the worst 'romantic' dialogue I have ever heard outside of Twilight (and for a film that billed itself so much on groundbreaking visuals, they sure must've hired a cheap editor for that part as it often felt like Williams and Sciorra weren't even in the same scene together as they met on the boats). Furthermore, really middling chemistry between our two otherwise excellent leads bog this one down further. Because the film is so very much based on the power of their relationship, it really dilutes things as these two just don't have the chemistry to come off as a real couple.A shame as, on top of the lush visuals, and rather sizeable too for a non-action fantasy, there is some legitimate power in the film's take on mortality and what's after. The whole concept of the afterlife being more modelled after you and the way you died rather than some strict tier/sections is really intriguing, and we get plenty of contrasts, often in an almost pseudo Biblical-Buddhist manner, such as Hell being caused by denial and guilt rather than 'evil'. Also, aside from two strong albeit un-connecting performances, the rest of the cast is pretty solid, with Max Von Sydow and Cuba Gooding Jr really adding quite a bit to the emotional heart of the film, and Sydow's voice just makes the rules of the afterlife seem so much more grand and weighty. Oh, and Michael Kamen's score is just beautiful. Utterly.In the end, I applaud Vincent Ward for trying, I really do. He threw out his hand at such an expansive piece as this and injected flair. However, a few fundamental errors ended up costing the film a lot more than I would've liked, and though it's still leaps and bounds better than Williams' other meta-life epic 'Being Human', it still doesn't quite soar. Pity.

Think of Green Pastures, the classic Broadway play which shows black angels in heaven revisiting the story of the bible, or the tacky Goin' to Heaven on a Mule sequence from Wonder Bar where a black-faced Al Jolson goes to the teeny-tiny black heaven, totally overwhelmed by the huge white heaven. There are no black-faced dancers tap-dancing out of watermelons in this touching fantasy which shows that love transcends tragedy and that faith and determination know no bounds when it comes to eternal life.Robin Williams is a husband and father tragically killed in a car accident, and despondent wife Annabella Sciorra commits suicide over her grief. It turns out that their children have died too, and in heaven, Williams is reunited with one of them who indicates that Sciorra has gone to hell. He refuses to live in heaven while she is suffering in hell, so he ventures to the darkest place of the soul in order to rescue her. Assistance from a wise angel (Cuba Gooding Jr.) aids him in getting to the world of Hades, and the horrors he finds are great.Both the beauty and darkness of the soul are explored in this powerful drama which brought out mixed reactions upon its first release. Cynical critics dismissed the film, but the more sensitive and spiritual welcomed it with open arms. The shots of the painting which is heaven are breathtaking to look at, and Williams' joy there is overwhelming. But he's a man on a mission, and once his determination to save his wife becomes his goal, no heaven is big enough to hold him. Hell is a world of unspeakable horrors, and must be seen to be believed. Whether or not you believe in the existence of either place, you can't help but be mesmerized over what happens here. The ending may seem somewhat forced, but truly indicates what the power of forgiveness and redemption means and that is the message that stands out in this most remarkable piece of art.

He is in Heaven, she is in Purgatory, and has to step over an eternal sea of lost souls to get to her. Her Purgatory traps her in her own little house much like it was on Earth, only very badly in need of repair. His journey reminds me of Hades from ancient mythology and Dante's Inferno. The special effects are so rich (beautiful at first) and nightmarish that it is almost a horror film. Great ending, although a bit forced. The alternate ending, (on the DVD) showing live birth, seems truer to the story, but really isn't satisfying. In Heaven you meet your dog and everyone you should, but they all look different! A well deserved Oscar for special effects. It should have won for the brilliant screenplay (By Richard Matheson) as well. One of Robin Williams most unusual and non-comedic roles, a very sad movie for the most part, but stay with it. It is rewarding at the end.

There /will/ be tears in your eyes, but they'll be because of different, other, more significant reasons than just two individuals loving each other and all that jazz.This is a story about soul mates. About reincarnation. About family, and suicide, and depression. It's not a happy story. It starts with death, continues in death, and ends in death--and rebirth. It's the story of a man and a woman who love each other and who lose their kids to an accident; she becomes understandably depressed after that and their relationship goes all kind of wonky. The movie becomes really, really dark. There's depression, and suicidal thoughts, so if any of this is a trigger for you you shouldn't watch it. The suicidal thoughts turn to actual suicide later, after her man dies in another accident, leaving her alone the last member of her happy family. But this isn't /her/ story--it's her husband's, who dies and goes to heaven, finds his kids again and is able to communicate with his wife even in death through their special connection. Then he figures out she's committed suicide, and that she's in hell, and he wants to save her. Everyone warns him against it, and he almost loves himself in his mission, but it has a good, if sad, end.There are so many moments in the movie that just left me breathless and my chest aching.

Echoes of this movie would be later found in the animated fantasies of Coraline (2009), the Japanese animated family classic Spirited Away (2001), family sci fi drama A Wrinkle in Time (2002), The occult horror Silent Hill (2006) and even Anthony Hopkins's Slipstream (2007) and the most recent sci fi relational epic Cloud Atlas (2012).Even though a few of the special effects seem dated, but the surrealistic imaginative vision of an afterlife allows for some slippage. The use of symbolism and even Robin Williams sometimes stylized comedy is mostly restrained to allow the film's character be become its own individualistic persona. The themes of spirited, humor and life as well as the deeds left undone, and the depths of death and sacrifice rarely get as much exposure in one movie such as this.

There were probably many Christians who had a problem with the idea of Heaven being created by separately by each individual.  I don't think that the filmmaker's depiction of the afterlife was the point of this movie though.  In the movie I see Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) discovering his shortcomings and ultimately finding out who he is. After Nielsen dies he is introduced to two guides.  The guides are basically like freshman orientators; they show him the ropes of the afterlife.  We later discover that they are his two children, but their appearances are not as they were on earth.  Nielsen's daughter has taken on the appearance of a flight attendant that her father once said was beautiful.  His son looked like the doctor that Nielsen first interned under, because he was the only man that Nielsen ever listened to.  Both of his children became what they thought their father would want them to be. This is significant because it helps Nielsen to realize the expectations he weighed his children down with.  Nielsen realized he never became the father he longed to be. While in his personal heaven, Nielsen was never truly happy.  His heaven was an existential situation where he could everything but what he wanted most. The film shows that although could create for himself a whole world containing everything he wanted but his wife, his wife was his soul mate and ultimately he was incomplete without her.  To get her back he must journey into Hell and essentially redeem her.  In Hell he redeems her but only by first giving up and joining her in her mind, where the movie claims reality resides. Nielsen makes a journey from heaven to hell and back, but more importantly he makes a journey towards completeness through selfless love.  His heaven was not paradise until he learned to be present to those whom he claimed to love.In a movie about the afterlife you would expect the issue of God to be dealt with, and in fact it was, though briefly.  The heaven presented in What Dreams May Come was almost a place between the physical world (which is an illusion) and God.  God is said to be up there loving people all the while wondering why the people haven't realized His love.  The film presented the idea that heaven was the completeness found in the presence of the people you love the most.  Those people are a part of you and without them you are not a whole person.  An incomplete person would always desire something and never know true fulfillment, thus would forever suffer.

A truly amazing film, the state of technology limited many of its themes. Since then, the technology has made tremendous strides and the cinema can now boldly go where no man (or woman) has gone before. The only limitation is the imagination of the creative mind.WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is based on the novel by Richard Matheson, and was first published back in 1978. Matheson is a literary legend who has written some of the most memorable fiction of the 20th century, and has worked in motion pictures and television. In the 70's, his work began to move from science fiction and horror, and into the realm of the metaphysical. These epic tales of the human spirit dealt with humanity's quest to deal with adversity and triumph in the name of love. At the core of these tales were soul mates trying to reunite with their lost loves.Director Vincent Ward and screenwriter Ronald Bass have taken some liberties with the extemporaneous elements of Matheson's novel, but have truly captured the spirit of the novel in this film. WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is about the life, death and after-life of Chris Nielsen, played brilliantly by Robin Williams. Not only is the character's life a learning experience, but in death he must face many of life's unfinished lessons. The most tragic being the suicide of his wife, his soul mate, and what he must risk to save her. Chris passionately explains, It's about not giving up. However, the more haunting line, something I remember from the novel and a phrase my father often used, Sometimes you have to lose in order to win. With a film based heavily in the fantastic, the entire cast weaves into the fabric a rich and deeply moving sense of the human drama.Albert explains to Chris that things Chris knew in life shape the hereafter, and slowly evolves from there. For example, after he dies it takes awhile before he gives form to himself - he can see himself - and Albert. This wonderful, artistic imagery is an evolution of the concept of the man in motion used in Jacob's Ladder. His wife's paintings have influenced Chris' world, and before his world becomes solid it is a painting. Here begins the beautifully ingenious use of truly special effects.Ward works with these talent artists to create a world beyond anything we've ever experienced in films before. WHAT DREAMS MAY COME has a feel reminiscent of the fantastical films of Terry Gilliam, but exhibits an innocent artistic sensibility akin to the early pioneers of the industry, such as Georges Melies and Thomas Edison. These filmmakers brought to life images that seemed to leap from our dreams, and Ward has accomplished that here. He and the special effects team have capture the impossible, brought our dreams and our nightmares to life. In doing so, I believe they have succeeded where few other films have and delivered a film that is a shining example of what filmmaking is all about, what the early pioneers believed it should be about.WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a triumph of modern filmmaking. All the elements amazingly come together in what can only be heralded as the best picture of the year. It is a film that not only moves the heart but stirs the imagination. The accomplishments of the human spirit illuminate the darker moments, and are exalted by the film's truly unique effects. All to often, novels/tales are abysmally adapted for the screen, but that is not the case here. Over the years I have had the pleasure of being taken on grand adventures by Richard Matheson. I can only hope that Richard was as pleased, and as proud, as I was of Vincent Ward, Ronald Bass, Robin Williams, and the entire cast and crew, for achieving the most brilliant adaptation of a special novel. To all those people I offer this verse from another of my favorite authors, Richard Bach, who wrote in his novel Illusions, You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it come true.

It's true that the concept may seem  trite to those of us over 40 who have read and seen countless attempts at related material, but that should not spoil this film for those still fairly new to these concepts. If you recall how incredibly thought provoking and marvelous Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land was to you at age 18 you will get the point. Several years ago I picked up the book for a re-read and found it trite, unimaginative and sexist. Both responses were honest and real, but from different life/time perspectives. The same could be true for this movie. Only to those of us jaded by the genre would this film seem silly and less than spectacular. I think the movie was beautiful. It is sappy, true, but sap is what keeps old and young trees alive. When our society becomes too sophisticated to enjoy a good old fashioned sappy love story it is evidence of a withering soul.

I've never seen Annabella Sciorra before, but she was outstanding--she played Annie's grief and despair so well, it was heartrending. I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the film or read the book, but there is a scene in Hell, where Chris proves how much he loves Annie by making the ultimate sacrifice.

It is filled with wonderful scenes of heaven and a dark interesting view of hell. What I loved most about the movie is its' theme that heaven can be whatever you want it to be; It is the true realization of our dreams and the extent of our imaginations personified in our own paradise. People have the choice to reincarnate as well as exercising their passions to their full potentials.I was watching The 40 year old Virgin the other day and there was a scene where one of the characters talk about how great it is to watch the movie Ghandi when they're high on marijuana. If Ghandi indeed strikes our intellectual capacity while high, then watching What Dreams May come will stimulate both your intellectual, emotional and your sense of sight to its maximum level. The movie itself is a natural high. Director Vincent Ward has created a delight to our visual and creative senses in order to give us a different take on what may be awaiting for us. And what else do we ask of that one blunt we choose to inhale? We ask that it take us away, that it might bring us to a different dimension and give us an alternative to the unfair life that we live in. What Dreams may come does just that. Like a great movie should do, it takes you away somewhere else and keeps you at the edge of your seat to see what new area of heaven will the characters will explore.Cuba Gooding Jr. does a wonderful job as Robin Williams' angel. His soothing voice and distinct voice gives heaven a serene yet human tone. The human tone that hints our yearning to remain humans, filled with emotion and character, even when in heaven. Robin Williams portrays that human quality, when we can clearly see his satisfaction in heaven yet a drive that keeps him going to find his wife. The search for his wife in hell becomes the plot of this movie, which greatly weaves the unbearable human emotion of loss with the beautiful unknown destiny of our humanity. What Dreams May come portrays the virtue of being hopeful and that once we lose that hope we may succumb to a dangerous path in life.Indeed, What Dreams May Come is a beautiful painting waiting to be discovered.

Then,artists like all those that worked this movie out, succeeded in giving words and image to those specific feelings. We feel 'moved' by experimenting such coincidence and sharing it with others. That is the reason why Chris goes to a heaven that is the painting of his beloved. This reminds me one story of J.R.Tolkien called Ham's Leaf. Where the painter of a landscape, goes to live inside his painting when he dies.I didn't want to see this film for a while. I didn't want to have a special feeling about death or life (because of personal experiences). But when I casually watched this film on TV I got caught instantly. This is for me the sign of a good movie I am unable to move until the film ends. I saw in this film lots of signs of these times. An excess of beauty in all. A lack of faith in the sense of existence. A lot of information about everything. And such a big fear of loosing one's beloved.This film has made a masterpiece with all these strong feelings! You don't have to believe in afterlife to see this movie. Just stay opened to your heart. Even if there is something out there, it would never be what we expect it to be. That is for sure.

It says much for its power that this still happens upon repeated viewings.For the record, for those of you who own or have access to the DVD version, I feel that the alternate ending is vastly superior to the one that ended up with the cinematic release. It has the advantage of being less Hollywood touchy-feely and much more meaningful and logical in a broad karmic sense. With the alternate ending, for instance, one gets much more of a sense of the children as individuals in their own rights as opposed to being bound into their only importance as part of the scripted family unit. The wheel continues to turn, affecting all of them, which is something that the alternate ending drives home and it is completely missing from the cinematic ending. I wish that they had made the braver decision rather than going for schmaltz. It's the only downside to the movie, but it is a marked source of dissatisfaction to me personally.(Perhaps this is a case where the extras you get on a DVD aren't worth it?

I watched it on a cramped airliner, flying across the Atlantic, on a tiny screen and surrounded by 250 other people. And I watched it at a time when my concept of love was still immature, as teenager.Still, at the end of the movie I was literally dizzy with emotions and fighting as hard as I could to prevent myself from crying.This movie is magical, in many ways. The visuals are stunning, but on anything less than a cinema screen, they are out of place. Watching on a 5-inch-screen ruined that part of the experience. And watching it in company prevented me from simply letting go of emotions (and crying), which was also stupid. Finally, watching it before maturing did also take away much of an experience that could otherwise have been incredible.Why do I regret it all so much? Because, on second and third viewing, the movie has lost much of its punch. It is a wonderful, and heartbrakingly sad experience to watch this movie for the first time. This is not a feel-good laugh-out-loud movie, this is perhaps the most touching story created in the past 20 years, and that is why some people hate it so much. A movie that tears at your heart and tries to squeeze out a tear or two scares many people, especially men (who, like me, usually do not like crying at all), but it is incredibly well crafted. The acting is superb, the story-telling structure is a mixture of a classical pyramid approach (continuously increasing the tension until climax) and a series of flashbacks and non-linear storytelling, and it all works wonderfully. The dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it fits into the general mood of the picture, and the visuals enhance an already brilliant story into a fairy tale of epic proportions. The only criticism I can provide is that, on second viewing, the emotional punch has mostly left, and perhaps it is a bit too short.The story, it should briefly be mentioned, deals with a husband and father whose children died a few years ago, and who now also falls victim to a car crash.

It functions on a level of grace and transcendence that's very difficult to achieve in film, but nevertheless, it soars on gossamer wings of unprecedented, jaw dropping creation, steered to unbelievable depths of human emotion and wonder by its special effects, and revelatory lead performances. Usually I'm leery about films that concern the afterlife, and such lofty concepts. This one has a head on its shoulders though, treating it's touchy, very personal insights with a mature outlook. Robin Williams has never been better as Chris Nielsen, a gentle, caring man, deeply in love with his wonderful wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), and devoted to his children. Sciorra is mesmerizing as Annie, and this is her finest hour as an actress, finding the hurt, the fear and the confusion in Annie as she journeys to the metaphysical abyss. Chris and her have the perfect life, lovely children and a symmetrical, star crossed love that both performers capture splendidly in some lush early scenes that set a tone of harmony. But then, their children are taken from them in a freak car accident. Soon after, Chris is killed in a horrific highway tunnel crash as well (excellently filmed), leaving Annie on her own. Chris discovers that there is no finality in death, and he's guided into the beyond by the spirit of his former friend and doctor ( a lively Cuba Gooding Jr.). They traverse endless astral planes of staggering beauty, from sun dappled river scenes straight out of Botticelli works, to an oil paint stained paradise literally modelled after the works of Impressionism. It's a startlingly phenomenal sequence that leaps right off the screen at you, and it's no wonder it earned an Oscar for visual effects. Eventually Annie, wracked with loneliness and pain, commits suicide, and is sent to a plane eons away from where Chris is, a dark place where souls that take their own life end up. Chris finds out, and is stubbornly driven by love and devotion to find her, despite being told it's impossible. Thus begins a surreal, just incredible odyssey through the nether realms of spiritual void to find her, orchestrated in a believable way that makes you feel as if you're in some far off dream, and not just observing images on a screen. This film isn't about heaven or hell, pleasure or punishment, it's simply about the state of mind we make for ourselves, and how that affects what comes after. There's no god, no Angels, no demons, no religion here. Just a vast, sprawling dream world of abstraction, bits and pieces of our world, reflected through a subconscious prism and thrown out the other side in a dazzling display of endless spiritual realms piled haphazardly among one another, with no rhyme or reason. When Chris does find Annie, we are treated to an ornate, emotionally exhausting sequence, which both of them nail, and is time capsule worthy. This is profound stuff, spun up in gauzy fantasy, but moored in thought provoking concepts of mortality, cause and effect, and what love really means, in this world and the next. It's an extremely ambitious, thoughtful piece with acting, effects and story that go along way, and in my opinion, combine together to make it an endearing classic. "},{"Title":"Williams Great.   Gooding Mis-cast","Date":"7 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" I really like this ambitious, florid, morose and intense movie, but could not get past the fact that Cuba Gooding (Jr.., not Sr.) was mis-cast for the role as Williams' spiritual companion and guide. There was always an undercurrent of confrontation and violence to Gooding's demeanor. Even though he tried to quell it, it appeared just too intrinsic to his nature. There is a point in the film when Gooding's character is replaced by (the spirit of) an Asian woman (played by Rosalind Chao).., and perhaps the director, at that point, realized that the single-dimensional vehemence as displayed by Gooding was hampering the quality and altering the feel of the movie. Williams' acting, as Chris, is excellent, as is that of his wife (played by Annabella Sciorra) and Tracker (played by Max Von Sydow). The cinematography is not-to-be-missed.Many who watch this film will take exception to the message Suicide equals eternal damnation and misery. I think we must take this equation in the context of dramatic art. I can forgive the writer of the original novel for creating such a scenario, where the loved one needs to be found and saved from an untenable and uncomfortable position in the after-life.One of my personal beliefs is that some create the death of their physical vehicle (body) so that they can enter the spirit world to be of rare and critical assistance to a loved one who is still in corporeal form; help that can only be offered and performed from the spiritual world. If my belief is true, then this may-well have been what Robin Williams did, in real life. Perhaps he needed that spiritual assistance, himself. These things usually happen without our conscious awareness.Actually, my proposition, that of entering the spirit state to help a person still alive, is not as ambitious as that made in the film Spirits assisting each other, in very human, passionate displays.If the producer and casting director had had the sophistication to find someone to take the role of Chris' guide who had had a profoundly calm and insightful chemistry with Robin Williams, then this movie could have been considered a classic in the approach and understanding of love, life and death.

They have two children and are very happy until the children die in a car accident. Four years later, Chris himself dies and goes to heaven. There he is reunited with his dog and children, and is guided by an angel (Gooding) who takes the form of an old friend.He then learns that Annie is dead also, and is excited at the prospect of being reunited with her. But it's explained to him that it won't be possible -- Annie has committed suicide and is in Hell -- not the result of judgment against them, but it is their nature to create nightmare afterlife worlds based on their pain.Determined to find her, Chris leaves the beauty of paradise and searches for Annie to bring her to heaven to be with him and the children. But it's dangerous -- and no one has ever been moved from Hell to Heaven.Gorgeous cinematography and a very moving story, with Williams giving an excellent performance. It's an intriguing script and well directed by Vincent Ward. A beautiful fantasy.Given that one of the main characters commits suicide, I of course thought of Williams' own suicide throughout the film. And it made me miserable. If Heaven and Hell are really like this - and of course, we don't know what lies beyond, this is a story -- I hope someone finds him and brings him to heaven. He had too much humanity, warmth and talent and gave too much joy to the world to be anywhere else.

This is a fantasy drama film starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Robin Williams plays a doctor who is a loving father and husband named Chris Nielson. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a spirit that Chris knew in life as Albert Lewis a doctor, friend, and mentor from his medical residency. Annabella Sciorra plays Chris's wife Annie Nielson an artist who is a loving mother and wife. This movie makes me want to believe in the afterlife. Here are some details to make you watch the movie.At the beginning of this movie everything seems to be normal in the world of the Nielson family. As the movie continues tragedy strikes the family suddenly. The movie shows incite on how families change after losing one of their members. When you lose someone that you are close to it makes you feel like giving up. You can be depressed and full of hopelessness. In the movie a family member gets checked into a help clinic so they do not hurt themselves through troubling times.After the tragedy in the family the movie takes a twist into the afterlife. In the afterlife part of the movie it is just like some of the other ways we have all heard it described. People end up being healthy and live forever in eternity. Some of the scenes in the afterlife part of the movie seem really cool. If you think of something you want to see or have happen all you have to do is choose for it to happen. The Afterlife part of this movie is by far the best part. It will make you wonder what you would do if you were there. There is heaven and hell in this movie just like in different religions there are ways to go either direction. Resurrection is mentioned in the afterlife for those who are in the heaven side.The acting in this movie was exactly what the director wanted perfection. The emotions shown by the actors and actresses were very realistic. The visual effects in this movie were one of the best out of any drama movie I have ever seen. In the afterlife the scenery in the background is a must see. It won an academy award for best visual effects in 1998. Usually in a movie that has tragedy there is someone in the movie whose performance is not acceptable compared to the others. This movie is not like that you have to see it to know how good they did.What Dreams May Come is kind of a chick flick but at least this one has some good visuals to keep us men entertained. Robin Williams is the best actor in this movie it is a shame that he will not be making anymore. People will miss his vibrant energy that he shows in a list of movies that he has been in. If you have not seen this movie you should rent it first like people always say. Once you have seen it though you will end up buying it. This movie is kind of emotional and it will probably make you tear up. The ending of this movie is one of the best parts but the whole movie is great. "},{"Title":"A visually rich but thinly scripted spiritual odyssey","Date":"13 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visual feast (especially for 1998) that explores some weighty themes, but ultimately feels artificial and thinly painted. Robin Williams is Chris Nielsen, a doctor who suffers a great tragedy and ultimately is taken by fate as well. While in the afterlife, he goes on a journey to reunite himself with his wife. First of all, let me say that I don't subscribe to a belief in an afterlife, but the fact that the movie treats it as an objective thing wasn't really a problem for me. What was a problem was that the whole story was set up so quickly that the core relationship you're supposed to care about wasn't believable. Sure, the screenwriter covered themselves by having Chris and his wife (Annabella Sciorra) be soulmates, but this felt like a cop-out from actually doing some character development and building a believable relationship. However, the sentiment expressed by Chris' journey is an understandable one. It tells the story of a man who literally goes to hell and back just to be with the one he loves. Aside from that, the best part of the movie is the visual flair with which the afterlife is realized. One of Chris' passions is painting, and his early experiences there are very much painting-like. This film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1999, and from what I could tell, it was definitely deserved. The effects weren't necessarily realistic, but they were impressionistic and artistic. On the downside, the metaphysical content and ideas are practically shoved down the viewers throats. There are many conversations laden with language that's supposed to sound like it's important, but the story never really lives up to these lofty ideas. Also, when you create a fantasy world there are often rules established to that everything isn't pure chaos. Here, there are some rules established but the film doesn't stick to them. At times, it's unclear how the afterlife works, which could be confusing to some people (assuming they even believe in such a thing). Overall, this is a very spiritual film that aspires to greatness, but is only OK. Robin Williams and the rest of the cast give excellent performances, but the visuals only serve to paint over the cracks in the story.

Surprisingly after reading the information about the movie I wondered why I had not seen this movie before. After all, it sounded like an interesting movie.Interested indeed.What Dreams May Come appears to be a 'New Age' rendition of the after life as well as a commentary or reflection on dealing with life and death. A fitting movie considering the events of recent times.Although the movie was ascetically excellent (for a 1998 film even!) it seemed to lack a smooth flow of events. I could not help but notice as I watched that the movie was hard to follow with events seeming to be pieced together, although not bad enough to where I would lose a sense of what the film was trying to communicate. Some of the concepts that I picked up on in this movie were as follows- Theme of Holding on and Letting Go. - Never giving up in this life or the next. - Life as well as the after life is all about 'ME'. - Heaven and Hell are all of MY making. If one adhere's to the popular American cult of 'The Secret' and other New-Age ideas, then 'What Dreams May Come' will be an interesting experience. However, if one does not buy into the New Age experience, then this movie will be lacking. This film is very 'American' in the sense that it communicates that one ought to be entitled to happiness in this life and the next. Our main character played by Williams loses his children, but eventually gains them back in the after-life. Although they choose to appear in a way that will satisfy him. He then later loses his wife, and treks to Hell to win her back where they both eventually have some seeming form of happiness. Then, at the end, they choose to be 'reborn' into the earth to pursue happiness again - I.E. try to seek each other out all over again. Therefore everything in their reality is based on them and their ability to find happiness. It is almost as if life/death is portrayed as cyclic as well as a cosmic thrill ride where we can choose to do what we want based on our own whims/desires. In this film Heaven and hell are based upon our ability to let go of life or not let go of life and be self-absorbed in our own version of life. Although there are apparently other ways to achieve hell, but they are not described in the film as to not offend anyone. This film does not deal with the reality/existence of God in the afterlife. For that reason it is lacking in my opinion!Overall the message of the film is hard to follow, but the ascetic value is high.

Ir made me think about what his heaven would be like, if he was watching his family grieve and I hope he's found peace. This film hits home for a lot of us, obviously because Robin killed himself. I don't believe people who commit suicide out of sadness or loss of hope go to hell, I believe they go to heaven like everyone else - Maybe that's just me being idealistic. As a film though, this moved me a lot. It was quite a sad film but at the same time there were moments of joy and sweetness. The acting was superb. I've never seen Robin act in this kind of role and I think it brought out his gentle, loving side people who knew him often spoke about. He spoke with this fascinating softness that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.I feel he should be more well know for this role because its a great film. Annabella was also brilliant , she really brought out the raw emotion and pain a widow goes through after not only losing her children but then her husband. Although Cuba played a small part in this, his was also a great piece of acting (I wouldn't expect anything less from him). I cried a lot through this film, all for various reasons including the death of Robin and that pain of seeing him being wonderful and I am really going to miss him, also the film was very moving and does make you think, it also made me think of my life and what I'd do if certain people tragically left my life. So it hit home on quite a few levels. For its time the CG is actually pretty good, I've seen worse CG in films nowadays. Anyway, a fantastic film and anyone wishing to see a moving performance by Robin should watch this, he's incredible and always will be. I hope he's in his own private heaven at peace right now.

The character Chris could be compared to the 'dedication' that lies within you and Annie is a 'goal' or 'aim' to reach no matter what ever comes on the way, and Albert is your 'super ego' who is a mixture of contradiction, he guides you sometimes and meanwhile becomes an obstacle. Robin Williams is an incredible performer, Cuba Gooding Jr. stands awesome with his acting,lady who performed the character of Annie was also perfect, hats off to those creative minds behind this wonderful making, likable narrating style, overall its fantastic, one thing is true that after watching this movie you come out with an idea that Your mind is everything,your imagination is everything and you can create your world within the world you live, but the only thing you must have is the Faith, Faith on yourself.

Wonderful Victorian-era people walking and flying around. Amazing. Chris' afterlife is certainly 'heavenly'. His wife in her 'Prince Valiant' hairstyle. I liked the wedding scene when they retrogressed in the scenes back and forth crossing over her mental illness situation. Another rather time travel movie from Richard Matheson. This is in the afterlife, the hereafter, whereas in 'Somewhere in Time' the protagonist goes backward in time yet at the end he meets his lady love way in the future -- also the afterlife. Even so, Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve were good friends in real life. More good Annabella Sciorra is very pretty, as are most Italians IMO.The wonderful Cuba Gooding, Jr. This was a very intelligent acting job. He is Chris' guide through Heaven, and when he (Gooding) becomes Chris' son this is another excellent and smooth acting twist. This part is heart-wrenching. It is good that Chris had all the reunions. Von Sydow is excellent. I remember him as the cruel minister/missionary (husband of character played by Julie Andrews) in the movie 'Hawaii'.The bad No comedy here. No 'Mork from Ork'. No red clown nose here. No Peter Panning of 'Hook'. No wise-cracking DJ from 'Good Morning, Vietnam'. Robin Williams is truly versatile.The scary and spooky the scenes in Hell. The Victorians wear black clothes and hats here. They push black baby carriages. It is all so gloomy. In another Hell environment, Chris steps over the dead (yet lively) heads and faces. Ugh. This is scary enough to be almost believable -- quite creepy.Richard Matheson wrote for 'The Twilight Zone'. He wrote 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', 'I Am Legend', 'What Dreams May Come', 'Somewhere In Time/Bid Time Return', 'The Legend of Hell House', plus other original works. He was very good at romantic science fiction, witness 'Somewhere in Time'.Some of his other-worldly stories must have been quite difficult to film. In the Heaven scenes from 'What Dreams May Come', I think that the people flying look a little hokey. This is not a really old movie where the flying scenes looked really terrible and contrived; I expected better -- and these after-death flying heavenly beings looked rather funny the way that their legs curled up behind them. This reminds me of those 1930s anthropomorphic dog movies where the animals were forced to stand up being pulled by strings and ropes. These dogs walked and talked, and human talking and dog sounds were recorded. Some dogs were beer-guzzling alcoholics. The dogs wore miniature human clothes, hats, etc. They were involved in human stereotypical situations, such as spousal triangular murder for adultery, etc. Some dogs smoked cigars and walked with canes.10/10 "},{"Title":"Paying Homage to the Ancients","Date":"28 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" This is one of the most daring and beautiful films ever made bolstered by a genuine, poignant performance from the massively talented Williams.

It's curious why so many have leveled hate against this film, but I question their knowledge of literature. This film takes a huge amount of inspiration from ancient, semi-obscure texts; the 13th century The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, Milton's Paradise Lost and various Greek and Roman texts - and then tries to market itself to a mass audience - that's bound to confuse people. This film doesn't seem to have any other agenda than the power of everlasting love. As an atheist I think this is a beautiful, human film about so much more than what's on screen and that it transcends any religious divisions. It's easy to make fun of something that's completely earnest, so romantic, (in all senses of the word), and ambitious. But films like this don't come along often, and William's performance is powerful. I'm taking this film at face value, and it's beautiful.

That is a fail assessment of this supernatural film.Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) are a couple who meet in the lakes of Switzerland and a fall instantly in love. Over the course of their lives they have two children but end dying a car crash. Four years later Chris also dies in a car crash and ends up with heaven in his own perfect world and private universe with guide of a spirit called Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). As Chris explores this world Annie falls into a deep depression on Earth and kills herself. As a suicide Annie is sent to spend an eternity in Hell and unwilling to accept this Chris journeys to depths of Hell to find her.It is clear there was a lot of ambition put into this film. The most obvious is the visuals, using top of the range CGI for the time, used to great effect to bring to live Chris' version of Heaven. It is clear where Peter Jackson got some of his visual ideas for his adaptation The Lovely Bones as both Chris' Heaven and Susie Salmon's Heaven look very similar and some the visuals and foreshadowing that most films employ. The special effects are even more impressive when you see the scale of the worlds created and that it was special effects used for an art house film.Screenwriter Ronald Bass does attempt to bring in a lot of ideas to the film. He combines different religious ideas and beliefs of the afterlife, of Judo-Christian beliefs of heaven and hell, but also combining it with the idea of redemption, atonement and forgiveness in the afterlife, that people are equal in death. People are also able to be reincarnated, so having either religious beliefs in the mix and God is kept as a distance. Added to this are metaphysical issues about the nature of existence, existing, what happens to people when their die and how they can control and alter the world around them and physical appearance. There is even the idea of person's mental state in the afterlife and how it needs to be in tacked.At its heart What Dreams May Come is a love story, a romance about love in the afterlife and see what a man is willing to do for the woman he loves. Chris embarks on a Dante Inferno's type quest of going into hell to save the person he loves the most. But What Dreams May Come suffers from a being overly sentimental, from the story, the acting and the musical score. This is a film that wanted to tug at our heartstrings as Chris and Annie suffer and when Chris reunites with his children. Ward wanted to milk every moment of emotion he could and unfortunately got the worst side of Williams as a serious actor. What Dreams May Come is an interesting enough film and is does excellent job at showing a Heaven, a task that filmmakers find very difficult to do. It was juxtaposed to creepy screens of Hell, with Hell using practical sets and effects and CGI effects to showcase Heaven. The story is simple but works as a love story in a supernatural setting.Some personal recommendations if you enjoy this film are The Sixth Sense, Inception, The Matrix and The Lovely Bones (both the book and the film).

I first got wind of this movie, while watching a Family Guy episode that featured a DVD of What Dreams May Come. I figured they were making fun of this particular movie for a reason, but having never seen it I couldn't guess why; so I settled on watching this movie for myself. I'm glad that I chose to pursue this wonderful movie by Director Vincent Ward. In a short explanation, What Dreams May Come, is about a husband and wife who experience a tragic event at the loss of their children in a car crash. Four years later, the recovering wife is thrown back into a depression following the loss of her husband in an accident she blames herself for. As the man lives on in the afterlife he learns of his wife's suicide and damning to hell. Willing to do anything for his wife, the husband leaves the safety of heaven to save his wife from eternal suffering. Starring Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding Jr, among other notables. The aspect that stands out the most to me about this film, is the scenery. The portrayal of heaven is simply beautiful, in fact it was so shockingly magnificent that I couldn't believe this was made in 98. From the flowing waterfalls to the painted fields, everything sang of pure perfection.Of course the environment, though the most stunning, is not the only beautiful feature. The family dynamic and relationship between William's character and Annabella Sciorra character was beyond inspiring. The emotional connection and love shared between the two seems to delve deeper then the film. Their acting was so believable, that it would not be hard to imagine these two together in reality. The children also did phenomenal jobs, in the small screen time they had, expressing their characters and emotional connection to their parents.The script was well written and felt natural to the characters, none of it seemed forced or contrived. Cuba Gooding was exceptional as a character meant to be more then he appeared and other than Radio, was probably one of my favorite characters of his.Now what stopped this movie from being a ten was also what made it great, the scenery. After watching how much time and effort they put into creating this memorizing heaven, I thought hell would be explored to the same degree. It didn't have to be this outrageously terrifying place full of twisted tortures and demons, but I at least wanted it to be more thought provoking, maybe have some metaphorical meanings for suffering and instead it was average at best. Hell never really felt like hell but more like purgatory of sorts. There was also a fair amount of flashbacks that I felt took away from Williams character exploring Hell. Maybe the movie was intended to be more about the characters past instead of him exploring Hell to find his wife, but when I read the synopsis it made it sound like this was about searching Hell for his troubled wife.Fortunately this is a minor fault and doesn't take too much away from this gem that I would recommend to any and everyone who are fans of stories about love and family and the strong connection between a man and his wife. Or if you enjoy cinematography, beautiful landscapes and especially if your a fan of Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra or Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver stellar performances.A definite 8 out of 10.

Suicides don't see heaven because the act of suicide shows complete rejection of god and His ability to see us through any problem.

For many reasons, it shows that love does not just happen in an instant, or at first glance, but is something that you have to commit to and work at. It's not just boy meets girl, stuff happens, they get married and live happily ever after. Annie and Chris have to find ways to deal with certain things, which are shown through numerous flashbacks throughout the film. Like Chris being embarrassed to dance, and teaching his daughter about death. It's incredibly romantic as well as a tear jerker. Robin Williams, while he may be best as a comedian, did a wonderful job as a man in love. This film was very complex but very human. If you want inspiration that REAL love exists, and not that stupid teen movie stuff, then this movie is for you. Another reason why I enjoyed this movie is because whether you're deeply anti-religious or a devoted Christian you can relate to it. If you haven't seen it I suggest you do it now, because it's not even about religion really, it's about people and what they would go through for love and their family.

Any fan of Robin Williams should see this movie as he is fantastic as always. The other actors were great as well. However, it is very abstract and I was often asking myself what's going on? throughout the movie (especially in the first 20 minutes). It's definitely got amazing visual effects and it kept me entertained the entire time. It made me think a lot and I had to really focus in order to keep up. I even had to put captions on because I felt like I was missing things without it (it moves very fast). Very original I've never seen anything like it. It gets a 7 because the storytelling seemed off but I have seen far worse movies. I also have seen far better movies.

I've heard of so many scathing reviews and even Family Guy has made fun of this for being a DVD that people never buy. This is really one of the best love stories I've ever seen, and is surely my favorite.Chris Nielson (Robin Williams) is a doctor who is very much in love with his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), an art director of a museum. Even when tragedy strikes and the Nielson's children Ian and Marie are killed in an accident, the loving couple keep each other going. Things get more intense when Chris dies a few years later in another car crash and goes to heaven. For Chris, heaven is a series of paintings, several of which Annie herself painted. Chris tries to get acclimated to heaven with the help of his daughter's deceased dog Katie and Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), his mentor from medical school. Much to Albert's surprise, new paintings Annie creates on Earth are visible in Chris' heaven, and they come to the conclusion that they are soulmates. Annie is in a deep depression, and it's not long before she commits suicide. While Chris is learning more from other people's heavens and reliving some memories about his children, he is devastated to hear that Annie is in hell&#x97;as all suicides go to hell. Chris refuses to accept this, and risks his soul to venture through purgatory and hell to find Annie and bring her back to heaven with him.This movie is fantastic. Rarely is there a romance that depicts a married couple still loving each other as much as the first day they met. Their love and life is so much deeper than love at first sight stories, or movies that end with the couple just beginning their romance or lives together. The stakes are high in this film, the main character is not risking his life for his wife, but his soul. Williams and Sciorra are great together, and you truly feel the deep love the feel for one another, and despair when they are apart. The visuals are amazing, and the use of art and color is surely grounds for study by art and film students. The depictions of purgatory and hell were also interesting, scary and disturbing. Some people squabble about the religious meanings and errors and what have you, but&#x85;it's just a movie. Along with the romance between Annie and Chris, it shows the love story between the parents and children&#x97;even the family's love for the dog! It is an exceedingly depressing movie, but well worth it in the end. What Dreams May Come is an intense, beautiful love story that will stay with you for a long time. "},{"Title":"Very pretty, and pretty boring.","Date":"22 February 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" While this is a very gorgeous movie, and the general concept is very interesting, the key characters and the actual story leave much to be desired.First of all, we aren't given much time or proper development to understand or even care about much the main character. While Robin Williams is, simply by default, a lovable character in just about any film, the movie simply relies on him running around jumping and smiling and just being Robin Williams. The character itself has very little substance given to him throughout most of the film, he's just some random painter who loves his wife and is happy he made it to heaven.And then there's the entire conflict of the movie, his wife, and this is where the movie utterly failed for me. I guess the writers, both Richard Matheson (novel) and Ronald Bass (screenplay), assume that the audience wholeheartedly accepts Christian Dogma that anyone who commits suicide deserves to rot in hell for eternity, without any other explanation (or any one that makes sense, more on this later), or at least is willing to play along with it enough to actually care about the heaven and hell presented in this movie. The problem is, for what we actually see of his wife, the movie fails to give make us (or at least me) feel that she actually belongs there, or even understand why she's really there at all other than you kill yourself and you go to hell. When we are first introduced to hell (which, in general, is just a very poor-explained, very confusing segment of this movie), we are presented with the idea that it is full of selfish, greedy individuals, most of whom seem to be too concerned with their own worldly selfishness and greed to even realize that they are in hell. When we come across his wife however, she is simply presented to us as a very frustrated, sad woman who can't even remember that she killed herself, further complicating any hope we have of understanding her character. What little we do see of her character, is a strike contrast to the mass group of individuals we first meet when we arrive in hell. We are told at some point that those who commit suicide go to hell because their nature is anti-fantasy (apparently you can tell everything about somebody's nature by a single action they committed out of desperate loneliness), yet the movie fails to show us that the wife has any such nature.(MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT) I guess all of this is supposed to be made better when the main character decides to live forever with her in hell and this actually sends them both to heaven. The problem is, is that this doesn't make any sense. So she gets to go to heaven because he felt he couldn't be happy without her and he acted on it selflessly. BUT WAIT, isn't that same emotion, a selfless I can't exist without you emotion, the exact same reason his wife killed herself in the first place?!? How is his nature any less anti-fantasy, when their nature and choices are really one in the same, he simply was able to make the choice after his death and therefore did not have to kill himself. And what if someone is not fortunate enough meet such a soul mate on earth, are they not given such an important, eternal second chance? The problem is this movie fails to actually explore any real human morals, emotions, motives, intentions, or natures, and yet attempts to make statements about them solely based on human ACTIONS, rather than, you know, the actual morals, motives, intentions, emotions, and natures. Also, very little actually happens in this movie, yet unfortunately it is not really a short movie. So what we are left with is a pretty movie devoid of any substantial character, action, morals, and therefore any genuine emotion (what this movie tries it's hardest to deliver). But it has a happy ending so.... I guess... that's good?

I was absolutely floored. Never had I seen a movie so hauntingly beautiful. I couldn't believe I had not heard of it before. I picked it up only because it featured Robin Williams.This is a tragic story that brings to the fore uneasy issues that dance around the subconscious What happens when we die? Is there a heaven and what does it look like? What happens if we lose everything? Do soulmates exist? According to this movie, heaven and hell are not places, but states of consciousness. They appear in a form manifested by your thoughts. For instance, parts of hell were portrayed as turbulent storms and shipwrecks &#x96; e.g. the way one might describe a suicidal person's state of mind.The movie is deeply spiritual which means it won't appeal to everyone, but it's not directed towards any particular religion. Even if you are the least bit spiritual, you will connect to the themes.I was surprised to see some harsh reviews, but I can see why some people might find this movie silly. It's not realistic, it's meant to be surreal. Some of the scenery comes across as cheesy at times, but it is still beautiful. It's art. There are many famous paintings throughout history that depict the afterlife, yet when it's put into a film people aren't so forgiving.Admittedly, upon second viewing 10 years later there are some parts of the movie that could be improved &#x96; Annabella Sciora's character, Annie, laughs too much in flashbacks of the happy couple. This is somehow supposed to portray the love and happiness she shared with Robin Williams' character (Chris), but that doesn't quite cut it. There needs to be more dialogue.Furthermore, the kids were annoying and not very endearing, but nevertheless thanks to Williams' acting and the incredible storyline/scenery I could overlook these issues.I would rate this movie one of my favourites, if not favourite of all time, simply for the emotions it brought out of me - emotions that I have not experienced from any other artistic medium.

Can't guarantee the maximum enjoyment if you are not. What Dreams May Come takes you to the world beyond death and challenges your spiritual beliefs, not in a defiant and aggressive manner but rather gently and endearingly. There is this binary relationship between life and death, heaven and hell, good people and sinners.. etc. However, love becomes the controlling idea and the only human/divine power capable of bridging the gaps between those opposites. The heaven scenes are literally breathtaking and visually stunning. The hell scenes are equally horrifying and morbid. The story might be a bit slow-paced but the script makes up for that being beautifully written. Robin Williams was great as usual; the man who can make you laugh and cry in the same scene!

The special effects are phenomenal, the colors are vibrant, and the cinematography is lovely. The musical score, by the late Michael Kamen, is brilliant and emotional, and might actually add to the overall feelings felt for these underdeveloped characters. The plot of this is one that could fit in a 40 page novella and was way too small to make a movie on, and should have been expanded some way.The film starts off and right away we are handed these two characters, Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Anabella Sciorra). There is literally no development for these characters, nor is there any substantial introduction to them that would make us care what happens to them. We are handed them, given briefly their character traits. They are both artist types and nice people...we get that right off the bat, but that's not enough to have characters solely built on, but they somehow manage here, and it sort of works. Chris and Annie are soul mates, and they have kids and raise a happy family. Their kids die in a car crash very soon into the film, and 4 years later Chris is killed in another car crash, leaving Annie alone and widowed. Chris lives in his own personal heaven built on the paintings of Annie, and he's followed by his guide, who also was his doctor in life, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Chris is miserable without Annie, and she is miserable being alone, which eventually leads her to suicide, and she is condemned to Hell. Chris realizes he must find and free her. Though this may sound like a big plot, it's not at all. After 20 minutes, all the plot elements are out of the way until Annie's death.The characters have no connection that makes the audience feel they are drawn together. Chris and Annie are soul mates, but why? We never see how they connect, we are just told this through narration and a few scenes of them doing boring things and laughing. The characters end up being more developed in flashbacks throughout the film than anything else, but they don't really develop them that much or show who they are, they just show various events that happened in the past. With that said, I felt genuine emotion for Robin Williams as Chris. One particularly emotional scene, Chris shouts out Annie's name looking over a beautiful pastiche of a mountain, and all he wants is her in his heaven. For people who cry during dramas, this will induce many tears, not necessarily for the characters, but for the situations they are put through.Overall, this is a slow moving, small plotted movie, with characters as flat as day old soda, but the beautiful scenery and musical score almost make up for it. And under it's great looking exterior, is a lovely heart inside, which shows at many times throughout the movie, and might make even the hardest of guys feel just a wee bit sad.My rating *** out of ****. 112 mins. PG-13 for language.

Annie is hospitalized after a breakdown and when Chris is killed in another car crash in a tunnel reminiscent of the death of Princess Diana, Annie is unable to cope. Soon both are in the next world but due to Annie's suicide, in very different places. Chris' guides in the after realms are Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Leona (Rosalind Chao), but who they really are is open to question.Chris' mission impossible is to rescue Annie who remains lost in her own little world of sorrow and grief and bring her with him to the heavenly realms. With the aid of a tracker (Max von Sydow), he descends into the depths of hell to search for his long-lost wife. The story suggests that the next world is a sort of wish fulfillment. We are the painters and we design the outcome. You do not have to be stuck with your old identity but can choose the one you want. All you have to do is wish for something and it will appear. Of course, the film is saying that we create our own reality out of our intentions regardless of dimensionality but the message will be lost on most except for those religious partisans who will be upset at the lack of adherence to the Christian orthodoxy.If you've heard that What Dreams May Come can be maudlin, cloying, and manipulative, you have heard correctly, but it can also be very affecting and quite moving with some breathtakingly beautiful cinematography that is reminiscent of an impressionistic painting. The film strongest points are in these scenes that address the best way to communicate with someone who is depressed. When Chris is able to acknowledge that he failed Annie and is able to suffer with her, they reaffirm their bond and truly become soul mates forever.

I have trouble accepting the way the WHAT DREAMS MAY COME deals with suicides and the happy ending has always bothered me, but up until that point, I find the film incredibly stimulating to the imagination and appreciate the level of artistry that went into its making. Consider Robin Williams in what I think is one of his greatest performances. Annabella Sciora in an equally convincing performance. Max Von Sydow in a role that kind of echos his performance in THE SEVENTH SEAL. The painterly cinematography by Eduardo Serra (who later was nominated for an Oscar for the painterly THE GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING). Production design and visual effects unequaled in its imaginativeness. A full soundtrack of earth, heaven, hell, and beyond reflecting the human condition while making an imaginary world seem real and tangible.For all of these qualities, I feel like WHAT DREAMS MAY COME more than compensates for its philosophical and story-related flaws and what some have (unfairly) described as Hallmark card sentimentality.

As a fan of Spielberg, Miyazaki and Cameron who believes a large part of the movie experience is the visual amazement, I was enthralled. The storyline was powerful, sad and yet uplifting and was linked tightly with the imagery. Contrast with Far and Away which had beautiful opening shots of Ireland that had nothing to do with the story. I am not usually someone who is caught up in a love story, but this had a really solid love, a story that unfolded backwards, and one that was linked to being a parent and not just a young couple meeting.I suspect this movie didn't do well because it is a strange mix of modern psychological drama and sheer fantasy. It doesn't fit a niche. Those who do not enjoy both genres may be turned off.I saw the movie because it happened to be on HDTV. The blurb said it was about the afterlife and the title was from Shakespeare and I like a lot of the offbeat movies Robin Williams has starred in, so I checked it out. The opening did not hook me in until I saw the paintings around the house. Do not ruin this movie by watching the Full Screen version!

What Dreams May Come is a deep reflection about those who want to be always with their love ones. If you don't know what true love means, do not even try to watch it. It's not going to tell you anything at all. To me What Dreams May Come is one of the greatest memorable movies ever made, period.

It offers a stunning, arresting vision of the afterlife and preaches that love can conquer any physical (or metaphysical) boundaries. It so happens to be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and one unfortunately dismissed by most critics as being corny and overly sentimental.  I would argue that it is instead a masterpiece, and one of the best films of the 1990's.Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra star as Chris and Annie Nielson, a successful couple who have, seemingly, the perfect suburban life until tragedy strikes when the couple's two children are killed in an accident. To make matters worse, Chris, a doctor, dies in a car accident several years later.  These events leave Annie, an art curator and aficionado, in a state of emotional wreckage from which she is seemingly unable to recover. Meanwhile, Chris begins to relish the afterlife, a world where everything is coated in paint like an artist's palette.  He soon discovers that his mortal wife is able to communicate with him--through her paintings; her increasingly bleak artwork begins to populate his otherwise sublime world. With some help from friends he encounters in the heavens, Chris sets out to save Annie from her personal demons--a challenge much more difficult than he thought possible.The director, New Zealander Vincent Ward, follows up his previous film Map of the Human Heart with another great visual work.  While that film explored the barren landscape of Alaska, What Dreams May Come creates a whole new world, a world not unlike the depiction of the heavens seen in Renaissance artwork.  Robin Williams is the perfect actor to play Chris, an immensely likable character who we grow to sympathize with and who we want to see succeed in his final quest.  Annabella Sciorra is absolutely wonderful as Annie; look at the despair in her eyes, for example, when she is haunted by Chris's ghost at his funeral--you can practically feel the goosebumps yourself.  Her performance was definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Cuba Gooding, Jr. also performs well in a smaller role.Some may find the romance in What Dreams May Come a bit too sentimental and many find its conclusion too tidy, but the mood of the movie is one of hope, of restoring and rejuvenating love, and the ending is definitely true to this mood.  Anyway, the visuals in What Dreams May Come are most important, and they make it worth the price of admission alone.  This is a rare film, abundant in imagination and beauty alike.  And it's one of the few movies that's ever inspired me to want to make movies myself.  I give What Dreams May Come my highest recommendation.     10/10 "},{"Title":"I propose that lovers test them against this movie to find if they are true soul mates","Date":"17 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  I've seen the picture, and may agree with some of the critics, but I really think that they're missing the whole point.

To me the central point is, and that's all I want to share with you, the fact that it may be very rare but SOUL MATES REALLY EXIST!!, and this mature fellow has the wonderful reality of rediscovering it, as I did myself..! So, I truly recommend this movie for people that really love.

I'm one of those guys that choose to hold everything in not show any emotions, with the exception of laughter, with a movie. But for this movie, i could not hold back.Robin Williams plays a doctor who meets a woman on a lake, falls in love with her and has two kids. The standard romance movie plot. And that's what you expect from then on. Well suddenly one day, Williams loses his kids in a car accident. The ending scene there, was such a killer. I cried like a bi*ch if that is at all appropriate. Usually for these kinds of scenes i find them somewhat saddening but nothing to freak out about. A good example of this is Armageddon (when Willis dies). Well, after that Williams dies in a car accident too, and is introduced to a vivid, lush after-life that exists within his own imagination. He envisions his after-life as one of his wifes paintings, and is met there by Cuban Gooding Jr. who guides him into controlling his after-life so that he can explore it better. The plot changes so dramatically that it destroys anything you ever expect. Now that's what a great movie is.From then on it's up to you to watch. Because i forbid myself to ruin such a great movie for you. But the plot is great, and the acting is the best i've seen. Robin Williams adds the emotional element that is so rare to find in movies.

He has such extraordinary comic abilities, that sometimes he's difficult to totally absorb, because he's moving and talking so fast!  This was such an enjoyable change.  It seemed to capture the devastating effects of the loss of one's immediate family, and the Christian belief that there is the possibility of redemption and reunion in the next life. The use of brilliant color was also very beautiful.  The performances of all of the cast was terrific!

They make the day of their children's death a special day by calling it double D-day.  The couple is supposed to be mourning for the lose of their children on the fourth double D-day, Chris is killed in a car accident on the way home to see his wife.  She can not deal with her feelings and commits suicide.  Now the whole family is deceased, but the mother is still not with them.  The father is determined to bring the mother out of her despair and into heaven with him.One of the themes of `What Dreams May Come' is heaven and hell.  Vincent Ward suggests that heaven is what a person makes of it.  Everyone creates their own heaven.  Heaven is based upon an individual's imagination.  I do not find this theory hard to believe, but I do think that there is a deeper theme to this movie.  This theme suggests that love can conquer anything. Chris and Annie are `soul mates.'  Their love for each other is so strong; it unites them even in their afterlife. The story line of this movie is magnificent.  It is a heartfelt story. This movie can bring tears to anyone's eyes.  The characters are well developed which makes the audience feel for them.  I was also impressed with the images this film created.

Until recently, I had never even heard of it, and assumed it was another new Robin Williams flick. I was mistaken. The movie had a couple of years on the neck, and Mr. Williams had grown a lot as an actor. I will not recap the plot, since that have been done many times before here, so I will concentrate on what it makes me feel.In the beginning, it makes me happy, seeing the family together. A perfect picture. Then, when the kids are taken away by that traffic accident, the film hammers on my heart and I get problems with swallowing. If I should explain that whole episode with Williams speech over his son in church, my sight will become dizzy and it¬¥s tissue-time.This is a movie about not giving up, not under any circumstances, not in life and not in death. It tells me that everything is possible if only love is strong enough. Robin Williams Shines and so does Annabella Sciorra. The rest, Max von Sydow, and the others helped making a good one better. I would liked to have seen more from Sydow, but you cant have everything, can you..?This movie will be one of my all-time favorites. I have no problem with the heaven-hell thing.

If you have seen his latest effort, the Count of Monte Cristo, you can only wonder why studio execs still let him through the gates at the production lot.I find it hard to believe Ron Bass, WDMC's screenplay writer, is still employed in Hollywood while Ward is not. Consider that Bass has also penned such turgid crap the likes of Entrapment, Stepmom, Waiting to Exhale, Sleeping with the Enemy and Snow Falling on Cedars.On the other hand, Bass hit a few homeruns on the word-processor / typewriter, with Rainman, The Joy Luck Club and Black Widow.

There is more to life than celebrities, beauty, fancy clothes, and all that fluff.  This movie effectively addresses those important issues, and gives an incredibly symbolic & artistic interpretation of one couple's enduring love to overcome any obstacles in life or even death.  As a woman who has faced her own mortality and is fortunate enough to have a truly devoted loving husband who has stayed by her side through it all, I know this type of true love exists.

After watching it, I realized that was quite an understatement.  I know a lot of people found this movie to be a very moving one, and while I'm known to be quite sentimental, this one didn't manage to tug my heartstrings, mostly because it just wasn't very believable.I wasn't even all that impressed with the artwork.  I guess it's because I'm very interested in spirituality and metaphysics, and it just didn't seem to me that the scenes were imaginative enough to portray what heaven and hell (or any other notion of an afterlife) might really be like.  If you grant that heaven and hell comprise other planes of existence than our own (which they'd pretty much have to, considering the fact that we have to abandon our physical existence to reach them), their portrayal in the movie seemed far too tangible (granted you're pretty limited in that aspect when using a visual medium, but it seems like there could have been SOME kind of creative approach used in representing another plane of existence).  Also the notion that Heaven is whatever you want it to be seemed kind of limiting...assuming you subscribe to the Judeo-Christian view of Heaven, it's supposed to be more amazing, more breathtaking, more wonderful than you could possibly imagine.  In this version of Heaven, those who end up there are limited to the images they can contrive from their own experiences.  While this would certainly be nice, it doesn't come close to how incredible Heaven is really supposed to be.  I know this sounds like nitpicking, but it was one of the major reasons I found this movie to be a bit contrived.Then there was the actual story.  Maybe I missed something, but there just didn't seem to be much to it.  I may be just being harsh, but the ending seemed to be a bit of a cop-out (he loves her so much he'd rather stay in hell with her than go back to heaven alone, and voila, there's her redemption.  Nice idea, but hardly profound or interesting).  I know the whole thing was supposed to illustrate true love and soulmates and so on and so forth, but the way the theme was presented had that been there, done that feel to it.   Admittedly the acting was decent...but anything less from Robin Williams or Cuba Gooding, Jr. would pretty much be a crime.  And that acting, at least for me, was a bit tainted by the lack of believability of the film.Incidentally, if you want a movie that shows a much more interesting and convincing view of life after death and eternal love, rent Fluke.

Pretty pictures and unusual logic blend together in what seems like someone's idea of a concept movie.  Like Footloose was supposed to be one long movie video without dialog.  This comes across as a cinematographer's experiment, and a darn nice one too. However it doesn't come across as a film.  I have to admit I was perplexed most of the way through.  As always I gave myself to the movie -- believeing from the first moment.  But as illogical dogma began cropping up, I just couldn't suspend my belief anymore and that's when the film lost me. Around seeing his wife in hell, is when I zoned out.  The concepts of the afterlife were -- stupid. Why is everything 'over there' so much different than true life. Everything we believe in here -- is useless over there. As if, the writer was going out of his way in his attempt to show us -- we don't know 'nothing'. That alone makes little sense to me. While we watched their visual dance, Cuba Gooding Jr. narrated the film -- filled us in on Robin's life, the afterlife, the rules, the regs, God, heaven, hell, ---CHRIST I felt like I was in a college lecture hall again. I will say this - I'm dying to get my hands on the orginal book by that legend Richard Matheson. I bet anything Hollywood screwed up his original thoughts.

I don't think the movie fails to deliver the message about soul-mates, I just wasn't interested in that. What moved me, was feeling the joy of Chris' joy. I felt happy when he had just realized the reality of paradise and the paint was gone. I felt I knew what it must be like for God to watch the joy and happiness of humans. I felt that, that joy was worth almost anything. That all the misery in life would be worthwhile to achieve that happiness.I don't think the flashbacks disturbed the story at all, as some people have stated. This is how we live our life, how we remember things and it's a form of storytelling I enjoy. Having details about his life revealed slowly is nice, as it gives you the time to imagine what he's feeling. The movie calls for sympathy in the characters, if you don't have that the movie falls apart. I don't entirely agree on the movie's picture of paradise or the after-life, but as I said earlier, it's not about the after-life. It's really about life, and therefore the fictional paradise or hell isn't important.

This picture lacked good casting directors.

Or at least a story that is better communicated to the audience.  I felt that What Dreams May Come told the story of this particular family a little too well, a little too personally - that in order to feel their emotions, I would actually have to be part of that family in the first place.  The end result is sort of like watching a couple having a picnic, happy and in love - you don't really care because you don't know them and you're not one of them.  I was left feeling unconnected and even a bit resentful towards these people living their lives out of my reach.  I had faith during the film that they would eventually deliver on the emotional whammy that always seemed lurking behind the surface, an effect that seemed inevitable considering the storyline.  A truly moving experience always seemed to be inevitably around the corner, until it got lost in a lot of psychobabble.  It just bothered me that while the filmmakers accomplished the fantastical very well, they didn't nail the simple human emotions that have elicited tears from audiences in so many other, inferior films.  With this story of life and death, sorrow and joy, tragedy and redemption, the first aim should have been to establish empathy between audience and characters, rather than concentrating on wowing everyone but leaving them emotionally cold and distant in the end.

It doesn't forget that cinema is a *visual* medium, yet it also keeps up with the fact that they're supposed to be telling a story.  The lack of character development has been decried by some, but the fact that all of the characters are *dead* should be understood, as should the fact that all of the main characters do, in fact, change and grow, becoming, paradoxically, more alive than they were in life.  The movie succeeds in being touching and tragic without becoming overly maudlin.  It is a prime example of how very individual life (and the afterlife) really is.  Your individual idea of heaven or hell is not *supposed* to be identical to anyone else's, and the movie does not forget that.

I wasn't disappointed but What Dreams May Come is better than the usual overblown Hollywood romance. But there are problems, not so much with the acting (adequate) or the writing (ditto) but with the look, even though it's the most artistic.The problem is we get a Heaven that's supposed to be a contemporary painting, and it looks like a landscape from the Hudson River School or, for those who aren't familiar with art, like one of those old-fashioned Christmas cards. Pretty, even enchanting but not really satisfying as art. What you might feel looking at someone else's erotic fantasy. What kind of marriage did Chris and Annie have, anyway, that has no sexual memories? But I digress.More telling is that the landscapes of Hell are much more imaginative, more artistic. I especially liked the coast of Hell being littered with shipwrecks. Compare with the best detail in Heaven, that Chris's second guide wears a silver name tag. Even if this is explained, it's a welcome piece of humor. Robin Williams, how could you give us a movie where people laugh a great deal, but where humor is absent but for a couple of moments?

As a curious reader of the human use of symbols I was delighted. It took me a while to grasp this content but I was twice as happy when I did. I hope for the writer's and for the director's sake that they didn't expect less than the harsh critic they received. If their goal was portraying a dream narrated from a Jungian psychic model standpoint then they may be satisfied. Though their Egos may hurt a little I'm pretty sure their own Selves are quite satisfied with the gift they gave us. A writer fumbling with this topic can never forget that the Anima shall ever remain unconscious by definition. As a matter of fact I realize that this very essay is not going to reach but a few hands, and that's how it shall be.An interesting comment I found rummaging on the Internet was a memory dedicated to the film My Life . The commentator made a good comparison with What dreams may come but I will further his attempt by saying that this second movie was an unsuccessful attempt by the main character to cross the chasm. True enough, in My Life the main character wasn't allowed by the script's creator to engage in a new conscious-unconscious wedlock that would allow him to pursue life renewed and refreshed as in What dreams may come . In the same line of thought and given the ample spectrum of human experience in other movies like The War of the Roses , the Anima doesn't take any chances, takes full revenge and finally succeeds in destroying the male Ego figure. In this last tale it is not surprising that the main character is portrayed as a narrator and that the death of the male/female figures is described as a fall from their home's highest chandelier. But that is another movie.If the writer/director intended to pursue an intellectual adventure by bringing to conscience the contents of a dream and share a trend of thought known to a few then the subtitle to the movie  After life there is more  is definitely a misleading one. The title probably comes from Shakespeare's musings on death in Hamlet , Act III, Scene 1 For in that sleep of death / what dreams may come / when we have shuffled / off this mortal coil, / Must give us pause. And that pause is not to be found in a sturdy structured intellectual comprehension of images but rather in a flowing holistic condition that takes us to enjoy or reject the set of symbols that come to us during our lifetimes.This movie may be a great example of unconsciousness protecting its kingdom. It is no wonder the Greek mythology already realized that Sleep and Death were brothers. Who knows if the producers themselves couldn't interpret the title as it is, What dreams may come ... obtaining from the audience the feedback they precisely did. Dreams are to remain dreams and no matter how much of an effort is made to standardize their infinite content or to comprehend that there is such thing as the collective unconsciousness, we share an infinite world filled with symbols and human experience. And we won't be able to apprehend all of its content and thus achieve such a precious crown for our intellect. The experience beyond tangible and measurable reality remains as individual as it is by definition and infinite beyond understanding and that should never be forgotten.

The scenes in the hospital/mental health recovery area were either lacking purple or drenched in green. The scenes in hell as Robin W. was trying to talk his wife out of her self-induced hell were completely B&W until he started going crazy when we then saw the re-emergence of lavender/purple. And the final scene where we saw absolutely NO purple/lavender but very rich deep blue and vivid red.As my wife said it, the purple represented the lies/guilt that each felt and lived with but at the end of the movie after all the guilt was disapated, we see the two principles emerge with their true colors of blue and red, which I am told when mixed make purple.

Just having come off of viewing it, I feel as though I've been through the tear wringer. I was literally swept away not only by some of the most unique and creative visuals I've ever seen in a film, but by the whole concept that was carrying it. That being the refreshingly independent idea that we in effect can create the shapes, colors and tone of our own afterlife. It's an idea that first took seed in my mind after seeing Angelheart, but the message was far more subtle and still seemingly tethered to a religious predisposition. I've never seen this idea fleshed out more clearly and poetically in a motion picture, personally. And for that I'll give it a great deal of credit.At the same time however I felt that it was that same overly romantic tone that played a part in its biggest weakness. Like its main character, it just didn't know when to put its feet on the ground, and show us a little more of reality minus the interjections of a schmaltzy, manipulative score. During the first fifteen minutes of the film I felt as if I was watching a string of AT & T commercials, and quite frankly it put me off a bit. On the same token, the very end seemed a bit forced too.Admittedly, the sentimental scenes did do their work on me, and I gave in to the emotion while at the same time keeping my brain cells mobile. I truly have no problem with crying in a movie, my only problem was in the overly romantic and sometimes forced *way* that my emotions felt provoked.

Taken from Shakespearean musings presented in Hamlet, act III, scene 1; it is not merely a look at what happens after  &#133;we have shuffled off this mortal coil&#133;, it is more of a profound look at his first question-To be or not to be&#133; and the nature of love.The answer to Hamlet's first question is obvious to the vast majority of the people, but for Annie Nielsen (Annabella Sciorra) it may not be so cut and dried.  Though she has found her soul-mate, the tragic death of her children rocks her to her very foundation.  Her husband, Dr. Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), through exceptional love, understanding, and will, carries her back from the brink of insanity and suicide.  However, one of life's arrows of outrageous fortune strikes again taking Chris from her.Chris's new world is made up of the surreal images in the paintings he and Annie both love.  But her paintings and his heaven are each missing something-each other.  As she clings precariously to reality, Chris tries to reassure her from the beyond, and inadvertently, drives her over the edge to suicide.The heart of the film is here, for her suicide means she must spend eternity in hell.  It is not the hell of burning pitch and forked tailed devils, but the more insidious hell of self doubt, guilt, self-loathing, and the absence of love.  Chris's heaven will never be complete without Annie so he embarks on a journey to save her soul, knowing full well that it may cost his own. He leaves on his quest believing that his love for her now, as in life, will bring her back to his world.This movie could have degenerated down to a bunch of swell special effects that would have overpowered the story.  The effects in this film allow the story to cross worlds, giving insight to both Chris's and Annie's thoughts and providing a beautiful view of the their shared, perfect world.  The visions of hell are equally compelling with their grotesque horrors that on the surface provide a visceral terror to the undedicated that disguises the true nature of eternity as being without hope.Robin Williams performance is Oscar caliber.  His range of emotion, from delight to resolution to anguish and despair make the audience feel all of Chris's hopes and fears.  One can easily believe he is Chris.  Annabella Sciorra is equally believable as the ebullient young Annie as well as the despondent, suicidal, on-the-edge Annie.The movie is complex, has depth, and has a message about transcendent nature of true, unconditional love.  While the message is wholesome, the movie is too graphic in parts, and the subject matter too disturbing for younger viewers.

Big Stars, big budget, and spectacular special effects, failed to accomplish what SOMEWHERE IN TIME (from the same writer novel, and producer) successfully accomplished in spite of some bad acting and a near zero-budget.

The premise is very solid A soul-mated couple lose their family to a car wreck. The father soon dies and has to deal with his quilt from life in order to live out eternity in heaven with a clear conscience. A wrench is tossed in when his wife loses her mind and commits suicide taking her to hell. The man feels heaven isn't heaven unless he spends it with the women,  so he sets out to bring her back.The real conflict in this picture is not the obvious man versus environment, but, cleverly, because the man is in control of his environment, he is the environment, thus it is man versus himself.Careful not to confuse time lines in this picture, there are no flashbacks. Time means nothing in heaven, memories are real-time, when he resolves issues in his so-called flashbacks, the issues are also resolved in heaven. Most of the reviews I have read to date missed this fact. They say there is too much time spent in flashbacks.  Each of the flashbacks take place in extreme environments themselves so I believe that the flashbacks are real-time, he is reliving the past.  Early in the film we are told that in heaven, thought is real and matter is the illusion, therefore, if he is thinking it, it is real, and he has the ability to change it.I think this film will go over the heads of a lot of the population, who, may mistake this for a cheesy love story. But scratch this away and you have a story that demands you explore yourself. It may leave you reflecting those places we keep putting off in ourselves that one day we may have to face, and asks us to decide if we have the character in us to face our darkest selves.All this plus an art direction that is gorgeous to boot. Stunning imagery, breathtaking visions, mind-expanding special effects. One of the best looking pictures ever made.1. See this film. 2. Make sure you see it on the big screen. 3.

A decent and artistic one, but I doubt anyone will be interested in it 300 years from now as they will be in Dante.There is no question, from the outset, of where the plot is going to go; the execution is what makes the movie interesting. This is a rare example of a movie that uses special effects as a vehicle for telling the story and not just for gee whiz onscreen acrobatics.Just as the plot borrows heavy-handedly from Dante (et al), the cinematography is a well executed series of references to all manner of fine art, from Monet to Maxfield Parrish to the Renaissance masters, and indeed a lot of the movie feels not so much like a motion picture as a motion painting. Other visual cues are well done, as for example the use of color (blue a symbol of death, red of life), light and darkness.But aside from some impressive eye candy, the story itself is carried sluggishly and too predictably -- it seems pretty clear that the screenwriters had a smaller budget than the effects people. The happy Hollywood ending is a disappointment but no surprise. Thematically in the same vein as movies like Contact and Forrest Gump, viewers that found those movies enlightening will be pleased, while others are likely to find this kind of storytelling heavy handed.Subtle as a flying hammer in other words.

Right from the beginning it tries to grab you and squeeze every tear it can out of you, but the pacing is all screwed up and so it just doesn't work. Robin Williams is always good, though there are times when subtlety would've been far more effective than all the shouting he does. Annabella Sciorra is the doomed love, and despite a great opening lake scene with the two, the rest of the film is so depressive that the chemistry between the two never really gets to flex and bores you to death (pardon the pun).

Some may find this movie somewhat disjointed with various flashbacks, etc., but it does fit the paradigm of human thought.  We find ourselves remembering things at different times; a side-tracking of sorts which brings seemingly unrelated events together at various points in time. In this case, it provides a natural unfolding of our understanding of William's character and past.While the movie does not adhere to traditional views of the afterlife, and (more or less) side-steps the issue of evil, it is nevertheless a tale which carries us off to what a wonderful heaven it would be....  No doubt some people might find it sacreligious, but those who reject this movie on those grounds will be losing out.  Don't let the feel-good theology stop you from seeing this film.One point that this movie made clear, and did a magnificent job of doing so, is that our relationships, especially with family members, is often molded by our preconceptions  our relationships often obscure the other person as an individual.  If we could see our loved ones in an objective light, our attitudes may well change for the better.  We also see the deep-seated effects that some of our comments may have; consider well the implications of what you say before you say it.What Dreams May Come has some absolutely delightful imagery; it takes reality and adds magic to it.  I will be surprised (and disappointed) if this movie does not win awards for cinematography and special-effects, and will be downright upset if it doesn't get nominated for them.Go out and see this movie.

Come on Robin, there is better material out there.Coming straight off the heels of a similar out of body or spirit world type movie called City of Angels, WDMC falls flat in it's pale attempt at grabbing you by the heart and leading you to eternity. I'm rather tired of all these new age movies where it seems their purpose is not to entertain but rather introduce the writer's own view of the after-life. Summing up extravigant concepts such as Heaven, Hell and even reincarnation with a few trite quips of dialog. It comes off sounding more like the writers opinion then it does the characters reality.Visually, this film is fantastic. When Robin wakes up in his oil painting world, my eyes were wide open and I found myself thinking to myself, How did they do that?. In this modern age of film-making where we've seen the behind-the-scenes of T2, The Abyss, Star Wars and Jurassic Park, I was really surprised to be dazzled so. I told my wife that the movie should have been a short. The credits should have rolled at the moment we see Williams' wife looking at the painting that was Williams' afterlife. Right when we see that he is standing in the same place as his image in her real painting was. This was a stirring moment for me. But everything trailed off at that point.You can have all the bells and whistles in the world but without a great story, you have nothing but bells and whistles. I guess that's why I felt no loss (other than the $9.00 for admission, it was a matinee you see) in leaving the theater. I didn't care what happened. I still don't care. We left at the same time Max Von Sydow decided to leave. At the gates of Hell so to speak. It felt right. I wish I could accurately describe my feelings at the moment (we just left the theater not 30 minutes ago).Suffice it to say that I must now rank this film along with the others I have walked out on, and that's not many. The one's I can recall at this time are Strike It Rich (Molly Ringwald), The Witches Of Eastwick, Drop Dead Fred, Natural Born Killers, The Judas Project and The Prophecy (Christopher Walken).I wonder how well we may have enjoyed There's Something About Mary, or Simon Birch. I may always wonder. We gave this movie 90 minutes to take us somewhere. I still maintain that if the credits had rolled at the spot I described, I would have nothing negative to say. Regardless of the fact that the children had died in the first five minutes. Shortly followed by the main character, their father. That's a tough way to start a movie. I wouldn't have wanted the job of the person in charge of the What do we do now? department. Whoever was in charge on this movie should've been fired.I am now on a vigorous quest to notify as many people as I can to avoid this film at all costs. As a DJ, I know many will hear my words. But will they listen?

It's always great to see Max Von Sydow and it was very interesting to see Werner Herzog even if it was in a bit part.

One thing I can't stress strongly enough is to go into this film with an open mind. Yes its romantic, yes its spiritual.

Robin Williams' character happens upon a very happy life - a valued, promising career; wonderful, intelligent children; a loving, beautiful wife; but most importantly, true love.  He has everything only to have it torn from him.  Yet, in the midst of his losses, he never loses his adoration for his wife.  He sets aside his needs, his pain, everything for the love he holds in his heart...through life and beyond.  Ultimately, he willingly charges forward through Heaven and Hell to do the utterly impossible, with every indication that he will fail, in order to come to the aid of his wife.This was a story about a love that could not be quelled by anyone, for anything, in any world.  This is the love we all want to find, and some lucky people (like myself) manage to find and feel for their loved ones so overwhelmingly that it makes you want to cry.

WDMC manages to answer our curiosity about life after death in a most interesting way -- here is heaven on film.  We are talking more than just white clouds here, in fact the deep textures keep us afloat in a very real, other-worldly vision while we wonder what we will see next. This film challenges too many belief systems (especially fundamental) and therefore will most likely become an under-rated classic.While the characters are thick, morose, sometimes sappy, the cast is an excellent choice.  Although Robin Williams is the lead character, he, nor Cuba Gooding Jr. overshadows any of the others.  The actors are the gods of this film.  Sometimes the screenplay runs a little long however, each character is truly believable against the settings and situations.  The script, a beautiful interpretation of the Richard Matheson novel,  demands a little faith from the audience.While you are in it, the film is so fantastic that you are challenged to believe what you see.  I wondered if anyone would believe it as a good script.  But when you get away from WDMC and start thinking about it, more is revealed as the entire concept becomes clear and enjoyable in your mind. Not that I would want to sit through it again but rather, I prefer to remember it.  WDMC is a cerebral film that warrants it purpose.Probably over the heads of most audiences; on a Saturday night at prime time, opening weekend, in a popular city theater, the place was only half full.

It is an epic. It is a work of art like none I have ever seen. What Dreams May Come is an Oscar contender. A film with true form, a perfectly executed setup, climax, and resolution. The director's use of color is incredible, going far beyond the hinted shades and occasional slathering of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. This film is nothing if not well executed. The experience is so intense that I do not think anyone can walk out of the theater unchanged. It may be questioned why this film deserves so much praise. Simply examining the backbone talent involved is an unmistakable clue to the destined success of this film.The film stars Robin Williams, a three-time nominee for Best Actor. He won Best Supporting Actor in 1997. Five time Golden Globe winner, plus four other nominations. ShoWest Male Star of The Year 1994. He is one of Hollywood's most decorated veterans and one of America's favorite stars. From his beginnings as Popeye and Mork to his great triumphs in Dead Poets Society, Jack, Hook, Aladdin, Good Morning, Vietnam, and Good Will Hunting, he is our perfect unsinkable warm-hearted hero.Williams' co-star is fellow Best Supporting Actor winner, Cuba Gooding, Jr. His believability in the role is outstanding, a lesser thespian could not have pulled it off. A complete departure from his part in Jerry McGuire, Gooding has done it again, bringing to life a tortured soul, he pulls off a magnificent performance that screams to be discussed on the ride home.The director of this heavenly cinematic tour de force is Vincent Ward, a man who began as an art director in 1979, and worked up to writing and directing Vigil, 1984's dark exploration of how children deal with their parents' deaths. In 1988 he wrote and directed The Navigator A Medieval Odyssey, a low budget epic which veteran critic Leonard Maltin described as, An engrossing, very imaginative tale. . . directed and written with great clarity, the film has much the feel of a genuine medieval fable. He went on to write, direct, and produce Map of The Human Heart, an unsuccessfully marketed dream-tale of a boy out of place. In 1992 he wrote the story for Alien 3, the death scene of one of science fiction's greatest heroines, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Ward is a man who knows the many faces of death, love, and fear, and has proven he can show them on film.The novel on which the screenplay was based was written by Richard Matheson, the man who, among his many other chilling tales, wrote the stories and screenplays for The Incredible Shrinking Man, Twilight Zone The Movie, and The Omega Man. A powerful soothsayer of death and madness who always gives hope in the end.The producer and screen-writer is none other than Ronald Bass, a man behind the curtain on some of the last decade's most celebrated films. Rain Man, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, My Best Friend's Wedding, The Joy Luck Club, Waiting to Exhale, and Dangerous Minds. This is a man who knows how to support a director, how to get things done in the background without going over budget, and how to tell a character driven story on the big screen.Digital Domain is James Cameron's Industrial Light and Magic. With their recent successes in Titanic, Blade, and Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, plus the visual champagne of What Dreams May Come, the D2 team seems to be destined to take ILM's throne. There is no doubt that they worked long hours to get this film done. As a student of film-making I was impressed with how well the visuals fit the story. As a professional computer artist I don't know how they did half of the stuff in that movie.So, you can see the power behind this film, now I suggest you go sit in front of it in a theater.

This movie is muddled and not a heck of a lot happens in it.  It's oversweet, and somewhat unsatisfying -- sort of like eating cotton candy for two hours.But even with these serious flaws (and they are serious flaws), this is a beautiful film.  It's a stunning work of art.  The visuals are absolutely amazing, the use of colors is genius, and the Kamen score brilliant.  This is a clearly a case where style triumphs over substance.A number of critics have complained that the dialogue was wooden.  I think this is due in part to our desensitivation to underplayed dialogue by DiCaprio-esque actors who insist on screaming all their lines.  I love you, isn't good enough.  These days, it has to be I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!! screamed with heart-wrenching anguish while ripping open their T-Shirts in the rain.  Here Williams, Sciorra (sp?), Gooding, and Von Sydow actually *deliver* their lines with a restraint that is refreshing to see.  There certainly is emotion in them, and seemingly genuine at that, but it's a subtle delivery and one that can easily be missed by today's audiences if expectations aren't carefully set.I guess their are two types of filmgoers  those who love schmaltz and those who don't.  If you don't love schmaltz, you'll be intensely bored with this film.  If you *do* love schmaltz, you'll be blown away and bored in about equal measure.

It deals with the true, raw passion that two people in love (soul-mates in particular) go through in both happy and trying times.  It conveys the true meaning of eternal love. The characterization of the Nielsen's is entirely three dimensional and totally realistic-Chris loves his family, he's hard on his children but remorseful about that; he also loves being a doctor and is incredibly caring and gentle with his patients as well as his family for the most part; stubborn; and of course, he is incredibly attuned to and in love with his wife.  Annabella Sciorra, as always, is beautiful in the film, both as a young woman full of light and hope and older when she is depressed and angry, though always loving her husband and her children.The film adequately depicts my conceptions of what Heaven and Hell will be like.  The vibrant colors in Heaven aren't gaudy or splashy but absolutely beautiful.  I would buy every single still in those scenes as a piece of art complete unto itself.  Absolutely beautiful, and it looks completely real, amazingly enough.  Hell is not the Hell I've seen in other films, but more like my conception, as I've said.  Dark, dismal, sad, depressing, and scary, but not any scarier than what Annie was going through on Earth, except that it was eternal. It showed what people remember in vivid detail is not always memories the people in those memories will have, but if you love each other then your love can transcend any bounds, physical or spiritual, and that if you're good, people will love, remember, and cherish you as much as you loved, remembered, and cherished them. The only criticism I have of the film is that it cut a little too close to home.

Well, I seriously disagreed with him to put it lightly, but this movie should have received that praise. What Dreams May Come travels further in that scope but also in the opposite direction.  Heaven is a world of crisp colors and beautifully rich images--a fantastic collage of many interpretations and histories.  The most frightening moments in the movie were when Cristy (Williams) had to near his wife while he was dead.  Their pain and the rage Cristy must have felt as he was told his perfect love would not rejoin him, wrapped me in as many pigments of emotions as the scenes filling me with awe. Though a little lengthy and perhaps overplayed at times, the entire film was a unique experience.  Just as Saving Private Ryan was described as the modern apogee of the war scene/drama, What Dreams May Come is art given motion.  The same feelings that Contact drew forth when Jodie Foster was laid on the beach is rekindled in this movie.  I fully recommend this film and any like it that utilize special effects to immerse the audience in a world of impossible wonders and unimaginable terrors. "}{"Title":"Looks great.

Wonderful sceneries of landscapes and glorious backdrops of surreal beauty.

Williams was definitely the highlight, and this was most definitely one of the better performances he's offered in a non-comedy role. The fantasy aspect was done well; the portrayals of heaven and hell were unique and original enough to be interesting, and the portrayal of hell was actually quite unsettling and even frightening. The movie is a decent tear-jerker - the whole concept of Chris and his wife being soulmates was actually very touching, and the movie set that emotional tone right from the stop when Chris's two children are killed in a car accident.For all those strengths, the weakness (and a major one) to this was the overall story. It was touching, but there really wasn't enough meat to it to keep me truly focused on what was happening.

I won't deny that some of there were awe-inspiring, but it didn't make up for the crummy story that it gave me. I'm not a Christian fanatic, but I am one and I do believe in God, but some of the events taking place here were insulting in my opinion. To say Annabella Sciorra's character Annie has been sent to hell for killing herself, after doing mostly good deeds in her life, I found to be rather a turn off. I really don't believe that's how it all works, killing yourself may be a sin but isn't god about forgiveness as well?. It's not a terrible movie, it's well done, it looks great, but the story is rather inconsistent and lacking for it to fully work, not to mention some of it is overacted.Performances. Robin Williams can be a terrific actor with the right material, but here is let down, and I found him to overdo it at times. There are times where he is completely heartfelt, but sometimes I rolled my eyes at the overacting he did. Cuba Gooding Jr. is good in his supporting role, but I found his role to be rather pointless. Annabella Sciorra is the heart and soul of this movie. Her part is given way to Williams for a lot of the movie, but it's her performance that is the best thing about this movie. Max Von Sydow is OK and acceptable as the tracker, but never anything outstanding.Bottom line. It's not a terrible film, but it's not the movie it aspires to be either.

Particularly wonderful for me was that Katie the dalmatian appears in heaven also. Really love Robin Williams nice guy movies and he is spectacular in this. Also really liked Good Morning Vietnam and especially Dead Poet's Society because his excellent characters in those are presenting positive and meaningful views of life. Captain, My Captain! is just wonderful in the context of Dead Poets. Anabella Sciorra is perfect in her role in this. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is eminently likable in this too. Max Von Sydow fits in perfectly too!Annie has every right to give up and commit suicide, blaming herself for the kids' deaths and later blaming herself for Chris's death too. The love that they have for each other and their children is very inspiring. Chris's sadness over pushing his son too hard is also very touching.What is most inspiring of all is when Chris finds Annie in hell, he loves her so much that he is willing to lose his mind and soul to stay there with her. How many people are fortunate enough to love like this?The scenery in Painted heaven is exquisite beyond words. The interplay between heaven and earth is very cool. The appearance of spirits differently than on earth is fascinating too. This is by far the foremost afterlife movie ever made.

This story follows the life and death of Chris Nielson and his soul mate Annie. This tale starts with the meeting of Chris and Annie; soul mates placed in each other's lives on a lake in Switzerland. They meet, marry, and have children -- very similar to many romantic movies -- but that is where the similarities end. The biggest difference in this movie is that death does not make for an unhappy ending. It in fact is a new beginning for the two.After a car accident, Chris crosses over to the after life without his soul mate. During this process, Annie is so stricken with grief that she takes her own life. Chris explores the afterlife, but is unwilling to except this new life without his beloved Annie. Hearing of the news that Annie has ended her life and has been sent to hell to live out eternity without Chris is by no means acceptable. He begins a long journey to hell to retrieve his love, a feat that has never been accomplished in all of eternity.This movie explores one man's view on the afterlife, a view so controversial to most that we don't often see it portrayed in movies, let alone the movie's main focus. To sit back and watch the movie I must dwell on the thoughts of what if. What if heaven is a place that I can make on my own? A world I create and control. One where I can explore the areas around me, share with others or just live in solitude, learning of life on earth. If I do have a soul mate on earth, what does that mean in the grand scheme of things? This movie is not one we can just watch we must evolve our thinking, allowing ourselves to explore the possibility that life after death is something much different then what it is typically taught to us. I found this movie to be a thought altering experience. It takes us down a road mentally that not many of us are willing to go down. It involves progressive thinking even for our time. If you are open and willing to learn about what the afterlife may hold, this is definitely a movie you can not pass up.

I love Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. but I knew it was supposed to be a deep movie.I'm so glad I decided to watch it.Not only is it a visual masterpiece, stuff has been done in that movie that I've never seen in movies before, but the plot is extremely original and VERY complex and to make a movie out of it is impressive enough.Robin William's character goes through a soul searching experience. Another reason why I love this film is so did I. In a way I went through the same experiences that Robin's character did.Most of the time I think the soulmate stuff is very cheesy. But not this time. The actress who played his wife and Williams did such a superb job. You completely believed they were meant for each other and deeply in love. There is not one drop of cheesiness in this movie. It is just beautiful.I'm not much of a crier, I never cry in movies, but I had tears in my eyes at the end of it. Happy tears. I was really, really moved by a very creative ending. It's one of my favorite endings to a movie ever.Very few movies stun me but this is one of them. It's one where you actually go Wow at the end of it and still a bit stunned by your experience even a day later.Everyone should see this movie at least once. It's incredibly thoughtprovoking and suggests stuff I never thought of before.This movie deserved it's Acadamy award for the visual effects, but really the screenplay should have won too. It's very deep writing and tons of lines that make you say I never thought of it like that before! Go see this movie. Please. You will NOT be disappointed.

It follows the journey made by Chris Neilson (Robin Williams) as he passes unexpectedly into the afterlife following on from the death of his own two children. His after life world erupts into a blaze of colour, as he visualises himself within one of his wife, Annie's paintings. It is evident that they are soul mates which makes it difficult for Chris's new life to be fulfilled. It is then that Annie (Annabella Sciorra)commits suicide and in the afterlife is destined to the depths of Hell. On discovering this, Chris then decides to make the unheard of journey to hell to bring her back to his heaven with the risk of remaining in Hell with her. There are a few surprises in store in the way Chris is reunited with his children and how he connects with Annie from the other side. The pace of the film is just as it should be, unrushed, graceful giving the audience time to absorb the elements as it passes through outstandingly colourful scenes. It's ending touches on the subject of reincarnation which gives it a wholesome conclusion and for many people food for thought.

Yet, the element used in the imagining was still there; paint.Purgatory turned out to be a lake where people stay until their fate is truly decided, whether they'll end up in heaven or Hell.Hell was very much different that I expected hell to be.

What is so powerful for me is the way this movie depicts the afterlife, the putting into pictures the concept that your thoughts have energy and are creative -- that we are co creators with the universe not only in our lives here on earth but also in the afterlife of our choosing, by way of our passions. What we are passionate about here on earth becomes a part of us and follows us where we land in our afterlife.The movie's discussion or presentation of both the concepts of life between lives, and the transition aspect of death; are also explored in the book Journey of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton PhD. I found both the book and the movie extremely helpful in dealing with the aftermath of the death of my mother of ALS and during the death of my father, who died gasping on a vent, to ease his passage into a life hereafter with comforting words and mostly with amazing love for both of them. They both also helped with healing of grief and this movie continues to help me illustrate important concepts beyond mere words.This movie is POWERFUL and moving, not for wimps, and will fascinate anyone who is exploring the concepts of co-creation. Join Robin Williams as Chris Neilson in the surprising journey he takes and his amazing discoveries. I love Robin Williams and the life force he brings to his roles; the innocence he portrays as he explores his surroundings, combined with intelligence and the brilliance of his humor as Chris Neilson, the love he shines forth into the world is just beyond words for me at the moment.

Well written. Beautiful music score. Take a voyage with Matheson, Bass, and Serra through an Alighierian adventure. Robin Williams' character, Christy, narrates the life and death of a family whose bond is greater than the physical. Strong Buddhist overtones. Students of philosophy, religion, art, anthropology, and literature will appreciate this movie. The character of Annie, his wife, is less credible to the audience -- but not because of any lack within the ability of Annabella Sciorra to convey the character through her talented acting. Annie is a Beatrice -- the character is always a bit distant, almost intangible, always dangling just before the audience. She is vibrant and lively, but not quite real. The character is meant to be this way... we strive to attain what we don't quite possess, and if she were to be any more tangible, our hero -- Christy -- would not have anything to reach out for... and we would not have the journey ahead of us to travel.

Dante's Divine Comedy, the 14th century poetic masterpiece, dictates God's perfect justice.  In WDMC, each person creates their own heaven and hell. It provides interesting commentary on a subjective, postmodern age. Suicides are in hell - not by God's edict, but by the person's refusal to understand their own death and let go of their own pain.Cuba Gooding Jr. as a Virgil-of-sorts is effective.  Sometimes he is as philosophically prescriptive as Dante's guide is in the Inferno.  Annie, Chris's (Robin Williams) wife is a parallel to Dante's Beatrice though in WDMC, she leads him to hell only to find their heaven together. Interesting parallels abound.

The height of joys and the depth of sorrow are faithfully played-out by the characters (particularly by the lead, Robin Williams).Although it's just a story and it no obligation at all to HAVE to match-up to MY own concepts of how things really are, the depiction of Heaven did not meet my expectations.  It left the place seeming too  etherial as if it were some place made-up only in the mind of (the character), someone who might actually be existing there all alone. The depiction of Hell, however, just blew me away.  It soooo very well captured my concept of what the place must be like; a frightening place to enter in; a place where agony of the human soul reigns in so many forms.This movie pulls at your emotions, first from one side, taking you heights of fulfilled happiness and joy; then it draws you down to actually feel along with the characters the deep sorrows of depression.  However, the story keeps you moving through in an intriguing way so that you can never feel stuck in any of those places. In the end, as you always hoped it would be, it's a feel-good-movie.

A fairly routine plot- soulmates are separated, in this case by Heaven and Hell, and one of them will go through both to find the other- held up splendidly by gorgeous visuals. Unfortunately, though, this movie has exactly one problem, and it's a doozy. I cannot for two seconds believe that Chris and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) and windswept soulmates.

Granted, soulmates don't have to be supermodel rocket scientists living in Paris, but these two are the passionless nice couple who live next door, their dialogue sounding exactly like dialogue and nothing like anything soulmates would say to each other. But then, on the other hand, there are probably people who can overlook that or even believe the soulmate angle. Great for them- they get to enjoy the visuals and the love story.

And don't get any candy either because 30 minutes of this is enough to make you diabetic.What do we have here?  An impossibly wonderful husband gets killed (trying to save someone else's life of course.  Oh, and while he's on an errand for his dumb wife that he generously offered to do.  Oh and after saving a poor girl from a childhood of misunderstanding by correctly diagnosing her migraine headaches instead of writing her off as a stupid kid) and his stupid wife can't take it so she kills herself and winds up in hell.  Mr. Wonderful is in heaven but decides he's gonna get his wife there too, because, dammit, he's just so Wonderful.  Conveniently, since most of the movie is in heaven, the screenwriter can make up whatever ad hoc rules he needs to to see to it that Mr. Wonderful is successful.  And I say he, because the male Robin Williams character is so perfect and such a thinly disguised allusion to Jesus and his female wife is so clearly the wretched, stupid sinner that the screenwriter had to have been male.Back to the movie, Mr. Wonderful has some saccharine sweet reunions in heaven with everyone he ever loved (dog, kids, etc.) and then decides to give it all up to go to hell to be with the dumb wife.  Somehow his self scarifice magically gets both of them in to heaven (see the Jesus angle there?). Shockingly the movie has a happy ending with everyone enjoying the wonderfulness of heaven together  Was Michael Landon involved in this project somehow?  Makes me want to go right out and kill myself to get there all the sooner.  Whoops!  Can't do that, apparently that's the one thing that gets you in to hell.I had hoped for a romantic love story about two lovers's courageous struggle to be together.  Instead, we have Robin Williams playing such a Great and Wonderful Guy doing all the hard work to save his idiotic, pitiful wife that you begin to wonder if Robin is simply a ridiculous egomaniac who didn't care what schlock got put up on screen as long as he ended up looking good. Romantic love stories work when the two characters are equals and both have to overcome their flaws to be together.  This relationship was so lopsided it gets annoying.And there was no Devil!  How can you have a movie about heaven and hell with no Devil?  Movies with the Devil in them are usually fun because a screenwriter can get really creative with the Devil as a character.  You can have him do anything!  I think if there had been some blow-out fight scene with the Devil in it (see South Park) at the end that would have made it much more entertaining.The special effects in the movie were extensive and reasonably good.  Hell was kind of dorky, reminded me too much of the oil tanker in Water World. And in heaven, everyone seemed to just dress up in period costumes and either float around or play hopscotch on this strange staircase in to the water.  Weird.I have a hard time recommending this movie to anyone but the most devout Kathie Lee Gifford fans (just seems like her style).  Robin Williams fans will be disappointed and his trend of playing heroic figures of ever more increasing Terrificness (Dead Poets Society, Cadillac Man, Awakenings, Good Will Hunting and now this) is starting to get a bit disturbing.  I think Robin is a tremendous comedian and actor, but he's going a bit overboard lately.

It's whatever you want it to be, but Chris can't have Annie (first she's alive, then she's in Hell; what if they'd had a different kind of relationship and she didn't want HIM?

I will say the movie makes one think, if one hasn't already, about the nature of the afterlife, and it's great to look at, but it's very frustrating.

Perhaps because of that, I often look upon What Dreams May Come as the closest we have to seeing the afterlife on a grandiose Dante-esque scale. The film's biggest selling point are its special effects, which bring Heaven and hell to life in an extremely vivid fashion. Scenes in heaven start off as a literal painting, which is stylish and whimsical; every other scene is ordained with beautifully lush and sunny landscapes and architecture. Later on, the film shows a fantastic cityscape with magnificent domes, arches, spires, with flying people and waterfalls all around it. Then, when the characters make their epic journey to Hell, they tread upon freakish landscapes ordained with shipwrecks, heads in the ground, and a sea of bodies. Scenes like these are brilliant and lovely, for they appear like living, moving Renaissance paintings.However, the experience of What Dreams May Come is a strangely uneven one. The film's narrative is cut up, interjecting flashbacks and dialogue at odd places. In doing so, the pacing becomes herky-jerky. The film will be drop-dead serious one moment, sentimental the next, then slappy, then corny, then beautiful, and so on. It also takes a little while to get to the good stuff; the actual plot of the movie doesn't kick in until ten minutes or so, during which time nothing much really happens. I think if the entire film was focused on the afterlife, rather than jumping back and forth and focusing so much on the characters' sentimentality, it would have been more effective. As it is, the film is strangely uneven.The story generally works, but thanks to the way it's broken up, I feel the plot suffers tremendously. Conflict is slight as it is, but with the frequent flashbacks and interruptions, the plot stalls most of the time. When the plot does take momentum, it covers rather predictable ground. Characters are generally likable and emotional, and are a pleasure to watch.A few concepts are challenging though the film takes the safe path through its theology, with its mention of reincarnation, with having certain characters take on the attributes of different races and creeds rather than being themselves. The film is also very Swedenborgian, given its assertions about love, punishment in the afterlife (or rather, the lack thereof), and the notion that Heaven and Hell are derived from the characters' minds or the state of their soul, rather than being real places. The film portrays an afterlife that's non-threatening and all-encompassing, which is nice, but runs contrary to established beliefs in theology and religion. At its worst, it's pure Hollywood sugar-coating.The film generally looks good, with a varied mix of interesting photography and vivid imagery. Editing is pretty wonky, given the way it cuts up different scenes in one giant meatloaf-style narrative. Acting is decent though Robin Williams eeks out a few of his signature silly lines, but other times he's really earnest. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s presence is somewhat bewildering, but he seems to have fun with his role. Max Von Sydow comes off as a Virgil wannabe, and Annabella Sciorra nails her role. Writing is a mixed bag; it's sophisticated in some places, simplistic in others, and really sentimental throughout. This production has magnificent sets, props, costumes, special effects, and locales. Music is nice too.The story's pretty random, and some of the ideas seem to be watered-down for mass audiences, but What Dreams May Come does offer a worthwhile experience, as it literally paints visions of the afterlife before our eyes. At the moment, it's the best we have to actually seeing what Heaven and Hell could look like, and that alone makes it worth seeing at least once.3.5/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Average | Film Pretty Good) "},{"Title":"Has its moments, but overall kind of unsatisfying","Date":"2 May 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" This movie is one of the most beautifully filmed I have ever seen.

Far too many of Matheson's stories have been mutilated in the transition to film; prime example I AM LEGEND was screwed up TWICE, as THE LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price, and again as THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston. Arguably the best realization of a Matheson story on screen was DUEL, which put young Steven Spielberg on the map--and that time, Matheson himself wrote the screenplay. (And, of course, he wrote many of the better original TWILIGHT ZONE stories.) In writing WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, Matheson set his cautionary tale of life before-and-after this brief time on earth, in a carefully-researched setting WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE TRUE the place from which we come into this world, and the place to which return after death. The research, of course, delves into the ever-growing number accounts of near-death experiences and past-life hypnotic regressions. Believe this scenario or disbelieve it as you will, to Matheson, as a setting, it was quite real, with its own hard and fast rules.Unfortunately, no such restrictions burdened director Vincent Ward or screenwriter Ron Bass, who produced a film that is rich in visuals but lacking in impact. Both novel and film tell the story of Chris Nielsen (a heartfelt performance by Robin Williams) and his efforts, after death, to redeem the heartbroken wife who committed suicide in the wake of his passing. The differences, however, are shatteringIn the book, Annie (an intense, if somewhat misguided, Annabella Sciorra) takes her life after Chris' death, leaving her children to fend for themselves. Fearing that this rendered her unsympathetic, Ward and Bass killed off her children as well, as though the onslaught of grief could somehow excuse her suicide.In the book, Chris encounters, and is helped by, people he knew in life. In the film, these encounters become a bewildering (and pointless) series of mistaken identities Cuba Gooding, Junior, is supposedly his old black mentor, but turns out to be his late son; Max Von Sydow, the mysterious tracker, turns out to be the old black mentor; and completing the trio of race changes, Rosalind Chao is the Asian-adult version of his daughter. This a a major violation of Matheson's scenario, in which PRETENSE IS STRIPPED AWAY IN THE AFTERLIFE, and one's identity is obvious to one and all regardless of whatever race, sex or other outward appearance one chooses to manifest.Most importantly, Chris remains oblivious to his situation, except for the information doled out sparingly to him by his contacts--although, in Matheson's scenario, a deceased person soon recovers the memories of his/her past, both earthly lives and time in the real (afterlife) world, and realizes his/her immediate past life was just a drop in the bucket.That said, the film works in a very few places--most vividly, when Chris finally finds his wife in her own personal hell (and the dialogue, for once, is largely based on what Matheson originally wrote.) But by and large, the cautionary message of Matheson's story--LIFE IS ETERNAL, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO AND SAY--is completely lost in a film which, despite its award-winning special effects, ultimately disappears up its own rear end. IF EVER A FILM CRIED OUT FOR A REMAKE...!

You made your character more human and real that any other actor could have done it, perfect. Thanks. This movie teaches us not to give up on the one we love. That life is just a way to learn to become better within ourself, more peacefull. Whether you decide to stay or come back, it is only for a short period of time. Plus time is not important, only life is, during or after. Interseting way of picturing heaven, or for those who don't believe in it, the after life. It shows and demonstrated that we will be in the place where dreams , the one we didn't have in life, may come..a eternal reality. He is in the picture his wife painted, his daughter is living in what she was day dreaming abut her toy. DEEP. And how his son choose to be someone else (cuba) to get closer to him until blindness falls and he realize that Cuba is actually his son.

And the rather unorthodox approach to Heaven was interesting to say the least. But as others have commented previously, I would have to agree that the ordering was often confusing and more than once even misleading. I'm sure the director/producer/writer or whoever had some reason for doing this, but I think it may have been one of those easier said than done moments on the drawing board. As far as the performance from Robin Williams, I was very satisfied. The part about his character that was less than satisfying was that he never made the audience form much of an opinion about him. Perhaps this was simply because not enough background information or sequential experiences were provided to us, neither of which were the fault of the actors. In my opinion, Robin Williams brought all he could to the role, which was more than anyone else could have done. Where the visual appearance and elements of art come into the film (which is almost everywhere after his death), I was absolutely thrilled. I think that this can mean more to someone who takes an interest in art or to whom art means something more, because it involves you in the paintings and the atmosphere at a whole new level and in some cases almost makes you overlook the bad organization and development. But you don't have to know or like anything about art to be amazed by this movie. It just serves to make a connection where the producers may have failed.So, because I was so impressed by Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. and the colors and styles of the movie, I hold it in high favor. But I can see where it gets confusing and slapdash, and I too wish it had been put together better because I think they passed up the chance to make one of the best movies ever.

I would sun in a boat just like that, while my father sailed it across the lake, and we would picnic. Although I have different views on an afterlife, it was nevertheless an interesting depiction of a personal heaven and hell and dealing with unbearable grief. I always seem to cry during certain parts. My favorite scene is when Christy encounters his old family dog. I still dream of briefly seeing my old childhood dogs, and we are so overjoyed at seeing each other again. I wake up with happy tears. Visually the film is mesmerizing. The use of such rich and evocative colors and odd, intentionally anachronistic architectures and art designs remind me of a day strolling through an art museum in some ancient European capitol. Some of the images are beautiful, some are very disturbing. I think Robin Williams is so charming in this film too. He once again proves that he is a solid dramatic actor. Probably most importantly, What Dreams May Come is one of the few films that indulges a fantasy I've long had of stepping into a painting. I have many paintings and prints in my home, and I've often wondered what it would be like to step into the world of that scene/that moment in time, as if it were a window. Haven't you ever wondered what was just around the bend in the road behind the Mona Lisa? Or to see 360 degrees around and what's behind the painter in say a beautiful Maxfield Parrish scene? This movie showed it just as I had imagined it, from the squelch of the paint, to the dreamy impressionistic look of the painted world.What Dreams May Come plays a little preachy depending on your philosophy and it's sad storyline may not be for everyone. But I think it is a beautiful work of art, and I just enjoy it as such.

In What Dreams May Come they bring up a different perspective of what Heaven and Hell look like.Your Heaven is whatever you want it to be, it's a safe haven for you because you just died and are probably scared and insecure about what has happened. Heaven you can create inanimate objects, animals, weather, anything, except Humans. So you couldn't create a loved one and lived with them there happily for eternity. But you can get desperate and imagine people.Hell is a horrible place only because it is of your worst dreams, something that you would not want to live for a moment, let alone a forever.

Maybe it's because if you thought life was too hard for you and you killed yourself, then you were penalized, by being sent to a life much worse then you had it. Or maybe cause suicides aren't aware that they are truly dead.This movie is a good movie to watch with maybe a religious community, and then discuss the different aspects of Heaven and Hell, or just a good movie to watch with yourself, or a GF/BF.

In the book Annie was not going to spend eternity in Hell, just until she would have naturally died. And in the book none of their (more than two) children died in an accident.

The saving grace were the stunning landscape images, rich lush colors like the portraits they're painted on; solid acting from the main actors - Williams and Gooding Jr; and a story, which though occasionally sidetracks through lots of sub-plots, still manage to maintain the thread that keeps you watching.

Also, this film tries to make you think in a way that is very difficult for people to follow (or accept).  If you can't envisage or accept what this film is trying to portray, then it WILL come across as a vapid, weak-plotted attempt to tug at the tears (because in a sense, that IS a part of what this film does).The film doesn't deal with the afterlife, not really.  It deals with how we view ourselves and tries to show the difference between the world outside of us and the world inside.  I personally found this film to be very comforting and inspirational in an odd sense, and more than once I caught some of my own thoughts within.It does have some weak moments - in particular, I think the ending could have been done much better, and did feel a little too contrived - almost like Kodak tried to make a moment at the end.  Also, the film is a little too thick on dogma - but I guess I can't really argue about that too much.

Not a bad question to address, indeed a pretty good theological question, but meaningless when God is left out of the picture.

I don't think believe that an individual can be retrieved from those depths, though the film makes a strong case for such.  But I don't believe that God would allow that (if you read the text) as it is the greatest sin you can commit against Him.

I've been waiting for years for a truly excellent film about a literal journey to hell and back, but this film certainly wasn't it. To the film's credit, the visuals were fantastic, and the trip to Hell beautifully recalled old B&W engravings.  The hundreds of dead souls washed up on the shore of Hades, along with Chris Nielsen's boat was an astonishing image, seemingly right out of Brueghel or Bosch.

But then the film's plot quickly deals with a series of very tragic events. Now this movie could have turned out like My Life which was so painful that I stopped watching it after 20 minutes. But instead, I very much enjoyed What Dreams May Come.The film makers made a wise decision not to show much suffering until the second half of the film and build to it slowly. But even more importantly, this is a movie built on beautiful photography and images that carry the first half of the film. The art of computer animation, photography and art direction have never been more stunning than in this movie.After such a visually spectacular run of one great image after another the film runs into several problems. After a while the images of the afterlife become less imaginative and more uneven in quality. It may be that the film tried to show and explain too much. This over reaching also begins to affect the plot. The story slowly begins to sound too much like psychology 101. Too much weight is given to psychological problems and mental illness as the answer to many great questions in life and death. Sometimes things cannot be explained. Along with psychological problems we get a psychiatrist. The interaction between Williams and Max VonSydow which starts out contrasting and interesting becomes too much like a therapy session to feel natural. Finally and most importantly the film shifts too quickly from gloom and doom to happiness. It undermines the naturalness of the feelings brought about by most of the movie.With all of that said, what saves the second half of the film is that all of the performances are solid. While Williams is good as always it is Sciorra especially, giving the best performance of her career, which made me believe. Her torment becomes the heart of the film almost to the end.Even with the shifting of images, plot and mood, this film worked for me as a series of special moments. What Dreams May Come has beauty, pain and endurance. On top of that, I sense the sincerity of the film makers who try to answer the big questions of life, who explore mysteries of emotion and pain. More than being touched by What Dreams May Come, I respected the effort put into this film.

DeMille had produced The Wizard of Oz and been able to utilize digital effects. DeMille had hit on a successful formula, produce biblical/religious epics and fill them with erotic images and sexy stars. There are no erotic images or sexy stars in What Dreams May Come, which instead combines a user-friendly visualization of the afterlife coupled with a special effects bonanza- but the idea is pure DeMille in its effort to widen the target audience by providing something essential to just about everyone.Directed by Vincent Ward and complete with a pretentious Shakespearian title (from Hamlet's contemplations of suicide), it would seem like a package Mr. DeMille could only dream about. Yet the $85 million What Dreams May Come did not enjoy the box office success of a DeMille epic.Loosely adapted from the Richard Matheson novel the basic premise lacks the originality of his The Incredible Shrinking Man. Rather it is a retelling of the Greek fable of Orpheus and his unsuccessful attempt efforts to rescue his lover from Hades. Which is an extremely downbeat story of loss and sacrifice. Although the film is ultimately more upbeat it remains a quest story including an exploration of the underworld by someone who does not belong there. While the digital effects are rather ordinary by today's standards the film's message is still comforting to many viewers. The score is the film's best feature and I frequently found it quite moving. Unfortunately, at 113 minutes the film would benefit from some trimming. The allegorical elements about communication between the living and the dead are especially drawn out, as are the pre-death segments which exist only to demonstrate that Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) is a selfless physician and extremely good person who deeply loves his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), a painter and art restorer.She loses, in quick succession, her two children in one automobile accident and Chris in another. Chris is transported to heaven with Cuba Gooding Jr. as his guide. The emotional range of this film is simplistic, and Williams alternates between elevated grief and awed wonder. Often he is fighting back tears or putting on pained smiles. After a half hour on earth and another half hour in heaven you begin to crave some drama or suspense. When the drama starts (there is never much suspense) it is best that you share at least some of afterlife visualizations being expressed by the film. Otherwise you will be underwhelmed.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

But then the film's plot quickly deals with a series of very tragic events. Now this movie could have turned out like My Life which was so painful that I stopped watching it after 20 minutes. But instead, I very much enjoyed What Dreams May Come.The film makers made a wise decision not to show much suffering until the second half of the film and build to it slowly. But even more importantly, this is a movie built on beautiful photography and images that carry the first half of the film. The art of computer animation, photography and art direction have never been more stunning than in this movie.After such a visually spectacular run of one great image after another the film runs into several problems. After a while the images of the afterlife become less imaginative and more uneven in quality. It may be that the film tried to show and explain too much. This over reaching also begins to affect the plot. The story slowly begins to sound too much like psychology 101. Too much weight is given to psychological problems and mental illness as the answer to many great questions in life and death. Sometimes things cannot be explained. Along with psychological problems we get a psychiatrist. The interaction between Williams and Max VonSydow which starts out contrasting and interesting becomes too much like a therapy session to feel natural. Finally and most importantly the film shifts too quickly from gloom and doom to happiness. It undermines the naturalness of the feelings brought about by most of the movie.With all of that said, what saves the second half of the film is that all of the performances are solid. While Williams is good as always it is Sciorra especially, giving the best performance of her career, which made me believe. Her torment becomes the heart of the film almost to the end.Even with the shifting of images, plot and mood, this film worked for me as a series of special moments. What Dreams May Come has beauty, pain and endurance. On top of that, I sense the sincerity of the film makers who try to answer the big questions of life, who explore mysteries of emotion and pain.

While these predictable things are actually correct in truth or opinion, it goes deeper into what this movie stands for love, sympathy, remembrance, emotion, and sorrow. They're all taken into a world (or two) of fantasy, but be left with the sacrifice of leaving whatever possessions we once had. It even gives a clearer view of our wishes that may hopefully come true in reality, just similar to Robin Williams' deep thoughts. Now I certainly have not had a great amount of cheer through any of his recent material like JACK, but this movie is a welcome change of pace to transform himself into a dramatic actor (and he has been before). Through his dialogue, he remains a comedy-driven guy, and here, he takes control of a finer film role. As it is heartfelt and joyous, it's kind of a difficult path to follow, which may have frustrated some viewers.

Max Von Sydow recreates his role of Father Merrin, thinly disguised as Charon the boatman who conveys Robin Williams (playing Orpheus) across the river Styx, past the 3 headed dog Cerberus (now a ship of the same name) in search of his wife Eurydice. The convoluted plot combines well with the lack of character development (everyone dies in the first 10 minutes)producing a visual feast of dazzling Hieronymus Bosch special effects which are unable to rescue this superficial feelings feast from itself.

It is a film that will leave the viewer wondering exactly what was it that they saw. The film makers consider this a romance...it is, but with a sickened view of what too much love, too much blame, too much demand can do to the personal psyche of a family. Despite the love, there is the blame. The blame Robin Williams ultimately accepts, the blame that his wife, played by Annabella Sciorra always carries for the accidental deaths of first her children, then her husband, played by Williams. This blame is too much...she commits suicide, while her family are in filmmaker Vince Ward's version of heaven. Williams takes the trip to hell to find his wife with the admonition from The Tracker, played by Max von Sydow, Once her reality becomes yours, there's really no way back. She does get back, though, and she and Williams decide to begin life again, on earth, to discover one another once again. There is little comfort in the ending of this film, however, because it leaves the viewer bewildered and unsure of what they just saw; and for those who hold a view on heaven and hell this film will prove to be a hodgepodge of incongruities.

Anyway, today, New Year's Day 2009, I decided to watch it. And the director DOES exert some control over this rambunctious actor. But he was still distracting to me - I would have given this movie a 7 or 8 had it starred, oh, I don't know, Viggo Mortensen or someone quieter. The topic of the afterlife and the nature of heaven is not treated all that often in movies, and I liked the way this movie handled heaven. It reminded me a little of heaven in The Lovely Bones. I'll try not to reveal all plot twists, but I thought people's appearances in heaven were well done. Hell is not so well done, but the movie does stress that hell is definitely a personal choice. The plot is meh-ish, but I loved the ending. Not the ending you expect (which does happen), but the ending after that. Acting-wise, Williams gives it the old college try, and does honorably (for him), Annabella Sciorra, as Williams's wife, is OK, but I never really loved her the way this movie needs you to love her. The actors who played the daughter and the son were quite good - I wouldn't change them. Cuba Gooding does well, as does Max von Sydow.

Alas no, and apparently the film is intended to be a depiction of what the after life is really like. Is it supposed to be a total fantasy?

On the list there was only one movie I'd never heard of, What Dreams May Come, so I figured I should check it out.Big mistake. There really is no story here; I could probably write a synopsis in two or three sentences; one if I worked really hard on it. Guy dies, goes to new age heaven, people talk a lot, a couple of inconsequential things happen and then there's a stupid, cloying ending. The movie is treacly sentimental, nothing happens for huge stretches of times and the whole thing seems to be just an excuse to wrap some visual effects around a hackneyed story. For the first half of the movie I thought, well, sooner or later the story will actually kick in and there will be some sort of conflict and drama to make this worthwhile. As what passes for conflict and drama do finally kick in though, they were done so poorly and with such draggy pacing that it didn't help at all. I fast forwarded through the second half, pausing now and again to check out the visuals and see if the story ever picked up, but the pathetic dialog and snail's pace continued throughout.Truly wretched.

The plot itself is fairly interesting, if not slightly confusing at times, but the dialogue is quite bad.  If told properly, the story could be quite compelling.One thing that really ruined the film for me was the poor editing at the end.  In one of the last scenes we see an over the shoulder shot of Robin Williams and can see his jaw moving from behind, but the words we hear are completely out of sync with his mouth movements and obviously overdubbed.  This was so distracting to me I couldn't even pay attention to what he was saying.  How can a major release from a real studio allow such sloppy work to be in the final cut?  Would it really have been that difficult to shoot the scene again?  If you can enjoy a beautiful movie despite weak writing and some editing glitches, What Dreams My Come may float your boat.  It's certainly worthwhile to see the creativity in how the paint world was created.  However, if you are a perfectionist and demand quality, there are several technical and content flaws that will prevent you from fully enjoying the film.

The only thing that confused me until this night was the mention of a daughter, whom I'd never seen; I thought he had two sons, but it turned out that what I thought was the younger son was the daughter.Oops.Other than that, what could there be to hate (or at least intensely dislike) about this movie?  A nice, sweet, sensitive guy named Christy (played excellently by Robin Williams) meets the love of his life, they get married, have some kids, and (as is LIFE), tragedies and mid-life crises occur down the road.  In this case, first it's by losing the kids, and FOUR (not ONE) years later, Christy's life is taken away ... both from himself and the love of his life.At first, he can't accept it and he tries to comfort his wife as she tries to get through the fact that she's lost yet another and therefore, ALL her loves.  As Christy sees, this only worsens things for her, so he leaves and finds comfort in a place he felt he would be comfortable to spend eternity in when he was alive The landscapes of her paintings mixed in with his own bliss.Through Christy's journey through His Own Private Heaven, he's guided first by his son (taking the form of someone who PERSONIFIED someone he knew his father trusted with his life).  Eventually, Christy meets his daughter again (taking the form of what she knew PERSONIFIED what her father respected in a woman).  And here, I guess, comes the message that Christy is fine with who he is and is therefore why he retains his own shape and likeness.Amazing graphics for the heavens.  God's Heaven, Christy's heaven, as well as the individual heavens for each of his kids.But, when Christy finds out that his wife killed herself and is now in Her Own Private Hell for the rest of eternity, he does all he can to find her and get her back and reconcile with the entire family.Of course, the images of Hell are disturbing, to say the very least (The sea of faces and the thought of being buried up to my head so only my face sticks out FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY really got to me).  But all I can say for those who thought it was too disturbing is Well, DUH!  It's HELL!  A place of eternal torment and discomfort, etc.  And, for those who are reading this who've attempted suicide, failed, and might have been offended by the Hell for Suicides message, I think all it was saying was that death wouldn't take the mental and emotional pain away; you take whatever you were feeling before you died with you.All in all, we have a movie that depicts the romance of going through terrible things to spend eternity with our loved ones.  The same kind of romance that has been told in every love song and/or poem, every pillow talk, every wedding vow, every one-night-stand scam, and everything that everyone has ever tried to put to words what they explain to be Love depicted on the screen.Along with that, we have a small message from Whomever-Dreamed-Up-This-Story that DOESN'T say that you deserve eternal torment because you committed suicide, but that succeeding in doing the deed will not take the problems away because you take whatever you died with WITH YOU.Christy took Positive with him; his wife took Negative.  What will YOU take?I read somewhere that this movie was based upon a book.  I didn't know this until I wrote this, so I don't know how loyal it is to the book.  But the only offense I can find by watching this is that it's not what we are told that the Bible allegedly preaches.  So, it's the movie-makers' idea of the afterlife.  It's just a movie, and a good one at that.By the way, as far as Afterlife movies are concerned, this one blows both Ghost and City of Angels out of the sky!!Excellent!!That's a wrap.

Luckily, we caught it at the very beginning, and the opening credits barely got started, so we got to see it in its entirety.  Also, luckily for me, I knew almost nothing about the film storywise, and what I thought I knew about the film, I would later find out, was erroneous.  It didn't matter, that didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film... or non-enjoyment, as the case may have been.Here's the usual SPOILER WARNING, which I think is important to give in a film like this, whose impact relies heavily on certain unexpected plot-points.  Read no further if you haven't seen it a couple loses their two children in a car crash, and barely has the time to deal with the loss when the husband is killed as well, shortly afterward.  We follow the husband into the afterlife, where he is presented with what is essentially a paradise, and is re-united with his son and daughter.  However, he soon finds out that his wife on earth has committed suicide in grief, and for that she has been sentenced to an eternity in hell.  He quickly journeys to the underworld, accompanied by a guide and his son, to see his wife and, perhaps, save her.It's an intriguing plot indeed, but I had two major problems with it.First of all, we have to accept as fact the film's depiction of the afterlife.  This would normally have been no problem to me if it weren't for the fact that the presentation given is terribly corny and heavily Western-religious influenced.  I would expect a grandiose task of presenting a version of the afterlife to be handled with some originality at least, or perhaps something would be there that would seem new, exciting or surprising!  But, no, we get the standard heaven-and-hell structure, with heaven depicted as a world as perfect as you can imagine it, and hell populated by tormented souls who wallow in the mud like something stolen out of classic literature.  It's been done, and it certainly wasn't interesting.But that was a minor quibble compared to the main point of the plot itself that we are watching a man whose love is so strong that he can do the impossible raise his wife from the depths of hell.  OK.  I see that the movie is about this all-powerful, moving, conquering aspect of love.  However, I am not convinced that I should just be happening to watch the one couple in the history of the universe who has succeeded in beating the afterlife system.  The son makes two things very clear to the father that suicide condemns one to hell forever, and that no one has ever come up to paradise from hell.  Now, I assume that both heaven and hell here are populated by the souls of the history of the universe; that's a long time and a lot of people.  And this couple... this one here, in the movie, these two who are really no more special than neither you nor me... happens to be the ones who beat hell?  The husband makes the sacrifice of pure love, and that alone was good enough to take his wife away from eternal damnation.  I suppose those eternal rules aren't that strict.  By the time the ending arrived, the whole thing seemed terribly contrived, and left a bad taste in my mouth.  It's like someone tacked the big Hollywood sign, in big lights, on to the ending.In my opinion, the movie turned to be narrow-minded.  Not only did it present a hackneyed version of life-after-death, it tried to make us believe that the couple we were watching was the only exceptional couple in the known universe worth preserving eternal happiness for, nevermind the sufferings and love of others.  The only saving graces of the movie were the very impressive special effects, and, perhaps, its rather humble goal of simply being a strong love story.  But the love story, in the end, was just big and showy, not strong.  The movie is probably worth seeing for the controversy, and I don't think it's terrible... I just happen to agree with the naysayers on this one.

I hated it because it's entirely, absolutely, completely, one big symbolic, memetic, allegorical, metaphorical bag of slop. It's preachy and overbearing and selfish. There is nothing to this movie except one filmmaker's bag of look at how interesting I am tripe. I relate this film to that vapid clown at a party who spends his whole time quoting things to show off how smart he is, meanwhile people are scurrying away to find something, ANYTHING more interesting to do.Robin Williams plays a husband who dies to find that his wife, who committed suicide some years ago, is not with him. He then travels like Orpheus to the bowels of hell to find her and redeem her. There's lots of plying through fantastic sets and matte paintings, lots of music, lots of blather from Cuba Gooding Jr. as ... well, you can't really figure out what he's supposed to be until the end when it's revealed to be something completely ludicrous. All the while Our Hero has to figure it all out.The big problem with symbolism is there is no connection. People -- well, sane people -- don't live in worlds of symbolism.

If you sit around thinking the love you have for your spouse is a hot-air balloon covered with paintings of carousels or something, then you need mental help.

It is a very somber and melancholy film. It is about death and a family torn apart by grief. The characters are very solemn. Be prepared for this. If you are not in the right mood, this is not the movie to watch. Still, I just found this family very dull to begin with. First, Robin Williams dies and awakens in a utopian after-life where he can manipulate scenery through his imagination. This sets the stage for the breathtaking imagery and scenery. This is definitely one aspect of the film worth looking at, the visuals. Excellent use of visuals was made in weaving the allegory. I thought that Robin Williams and Sciorra were a little distant and too intellectual when they should have been more playful and carefree with each other. The family did not seem authentic in their earth life. It seemed picture-perfect and idyllic upper middle-class family but neither their affection nor their family problems seemed genuine and candid. Many of the scenes of Williams and his wife seem somewhat clich√©d and mawkish- they meet on pretty lake set against the Swiss alps during a leisurely getaway, they lie down and gaze at the cloud, making up names and shapes, and ugh, I just wanna vomit. Furthermore, the cause for relational disharmony is also very weak. For example, one of the issues that seems to cause friction is William's pressure on his son to succeed in school, and Sciorra is too caught up in her career life too be able to drive the children personally to school (so that they end up in an accident with someone else driving the kids). It is also William's desire to support his grieving wife that compels him to take a trip (for some paintings she needs at her art exhibit) that eventually results in his losing his life. I thought it could have been better demonstrated that there were tensions, misaligned priorities, secular distraction, and so forth. This just didn't come through. I guess this could be a matter of interpretation. It is also the case that the more idyllic they are shown, the more dramatic is the grief that they suffer.During the ending, there could have been more drama in Williams' psychological struggle to keep his sanity and avoid sharing in his wife's fate. It turned out just to be normal family conversation. I thought it would have been better if William's character were shown enjoying himself in heaven but then being torn between staying in heaven and going to get his wife. The director instead took another route, with Williams being fiercely determined and steadfast in his desire to be with his wife. I think it would have been better to have Williams dealing with internal conflict about going into hell or not. The journey didn't seem to really build up in suspense or anticipation.

On the other, they have trouble recognizing people for who they really are because they continue to construct reality based on their own preconceptions.

Perhaps, Vincent Ward has heard that line a few too many times and has decided to focus his film a little too much on the eye aspect. In What Dreams May Come, his objective lies in the same boat as other filmmakers&#151;to grasp the audience's attention and entertain through visual images and thought-provoking themes. Ward presents What Dreams May Come with many impressive visual techniques and compelling themes, but his so-called provocative elements serve too much as an overwhelming cluster&#151;leading the cinematic experience to be much more overbearing than enjoyable.The use of color is powerful but far from subtle. The symbolism associated with the colors was very adequate to the presentation of the film but far too obvious. For example, the recurring connotations of red with love and blue with ambiguity were seemingly frequent. Every time the character of Robin Williams was reunited with his wife, something in the foreground of the characters was red. Blue was often associated with the suicidal wife or the clothing of the characters before they reached their deaths.Special effects, on the other hand, were overused. The slow motion during the mother and child reunion was over-dramatic. The expression in the characters' faces sufficed for the emotional scene; the slow motion exaggerated it. Also, the continuous flashbacks served more as a distraction and a pretentious addition. The storyline did not require the frequent flashbacks to explain the events in the film. The audience is not composed of idiots who lack common sense.Also, the conception of afterlife may appeal to a majority of audiences, but the style the themes were delivered strived too hard to be deep and just added to the heap. For example, the unbreakable emotional connection between soul mates after death was tacky. Whenever the wife painted a picture, the husband could see it in his personal heaven&#151;which was made of paint, because he and his wife shared a passion for art. Hell was pretty interesting as well; it was a burning boat. Ward's perspective on the inseparability between soul mates, heaven and hell is both abstract and fascinating but overdone.The melodramatic mise en sc√©ne of What Dreams May Come provided tasteful color usage, special effects, and an interesting plot. The key to a good film does not lie in constantly throwing vivid images and multiple themes on screen. In fact, successfully combining such deep messages and beautiful cinematography requires simplicity, subtlety and ingenuity.

Toys, Hook, Aladdin, Flubber and Jumanji are just some of the titles out of the 49 of this type that have been attributed to him since 1977! One wonders why Robin Williams chooses so many of these kinds of films. Perhaps he recognises his limits. It would be hard to imagine him playing the Michael Douglas character in A Perfect Murder for example. Williams organising a murder? Impossible. What Dreams May Come is about Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) dying. He goes to heaven and then endeavours to travel to hell  and retrieve his wife (Annabella Sciorra) who went to the other place. Along the way he meets Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is also dead. Chris also meets The Tracker who almost predictably is played by Max Von Sydow who is most memorable for playing death in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal all those years ago. All of this doesn't stack up too well however except that some of the images are amazing in the extreme. But we are presented with a vision of heaven that is truly lovely. Roll on death! I'd love to live in a verdant, stunningly beautiful landscape with the beloved dog from my childhood. Especially if I could even hive off and collect any special people I desired! This theology was concocted by ardent optimists. Hell in What Dreams May Come is a cross between Otto Dix and Hieronymus Bosch; a coloured revamp of William Blake's drawings of Hades gone bleak. There are concessions to modernity  though. The three headed dog Cerebus who guards the gates of hell in the old Greek myths becomes a wrecked ship. Max Von Sydow instead of being death is Charon the boatman. Some of the images are ridiculous but still memorable. Williams stumbling over the imbedded, wisecracking heads of the half dead bordered on farce. But if you don't mind a very fuzzy plot line and enjoy marvellously exuberant images of Heaven then see What Dreams May Come.

It's worse even than Barbra Streisand's remake of A Star Is Born. There! I said it.I found the movie in the science fiction section of my video store, so let's get one thing straight from the get-go. This is not a science fiction movie. As Isaac Asimov once explained, good science fiction has to be good science and good fiction. This movie is bad fantasy.The theme is Love conquers all, even Hell. I thought I was in Hell watching this movie. It is S-L-O-W. With long, long looks into the camera and frequently whispered I-love-you's. The Heaven and Hell scenes remind me of the Harry Potter movies; Heaven is not bliss and Hell is not agony. Somehow, in this movie neither life nor death are played for keeps.Real life is as preposterous as the Afterlife. Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) is killed by a flying car (like in the James Bond movies) in the Lincoln Tunnel between NY and NJ. A flying car in the Lincoln Tunnel? I don't think so. The Lincoln Tunnel is usually so jammed with cars, it is a parking lot most of the time.And how did heaven become one of Annie's (Annabella Sciorra) paintings? It's just stupid.I don't know how this movie got made. Maybe the book reads better than the movie plays (this happens). And they got Robin Williams and Max Von Sydow?? How did that happen? Well, the presence of Cuba Gooding, Jr. (who seems a likable enough human being) should be enough to warn you that all is not well with this movie.What Dreams May Come is an adolescent girl's fantasy of eternal love.

more repulsive attributes that the motion picture provides for and that be that there is anything honest to the movies ability to be showcased.This film and it is made evident in the film does not bare the burden of honesty but of telling a story that will be interesting to tell and to watch(as in gate receipts and or other residuals)The terribly mis-leading assumption that the imagery and the lights camera action provide for anything more than lights camera action and a days work is about all that the motion picture can provide.It is almost to unfriendly to suggest that there is any importance in a motion picture however the war that has gripped the very foundations of integrity is that appearance and showing off with perhaps a loud mouth and a whole host of attributes that are in fact unseemly has gained a foothold in society and like a virtual plague have mis-directed our intelligence ability to a superficial and even fraudulent set of assumptions about reality and our place in it.The film as this review will testify to having seen more than once does not allow our ability to know different and as well to know better but it does give details however discretely and even not the kind of details that we can draw a conclusion but the kind of details that keep our interest.How to place the purpose had by this attempt upon intellect?The motion picture must move fast due to the many causes that moving fast provides for but what speed does for you does not provide detail nor,is our cognitive ability included in a comprehensive outline as such.When the children pass as a result of an accident why should it seem like it actually happened but nothing happened,we are only told so.In fact the children were very much believed in and there passing was not and that is why we live on even after we have lost something so dear to our hearts that we can not accept the counter to our place or the loss of our place here in this world.However it is in outline only that this is witnessed to though the qualifying position is that the children never leave the picture they only move through the film with only the scenery changing.The same can be said for the passing of the Robin Williams character however it is here we will stop and for cause.I don't think we are looking at the story line until we look at the suicide and that is what this film was attempting to look at right from the start.The 20th Century brought with it one of the maladies of time everlasting and that is the century of telecommunications.The blatant and ever encroaching imposition that these representatives of a foreign power provide for have had an effect that is as un-natural as it is imposing.The violence that has been the hallmark of the 20th Century witnesses more than to a simple phone call but to a power that has been trained to provide more than its your dime.This cold calculating treachery was never more foreign than it was ever conceived of and though it is difficult to understand that we actually had a Civil War which was about the right not to govern but to enslave a human being that seems to have been given a second life through the advent of the telecommunications bugaboo of radio,television,wireless communications and being able to send pictures through the air without wires in a act of telepathy.This virtual power of suggestion is the corner stone to what has in fact actually occurred and that is the heart has been shocked with the loss of its ability to dream.The dream has been imposed upon by a foreign power and is in fact quite dead and all that it represents has been removed.The American Dream is more of a beast not of this world which has hurt the human kinds ability to know.It further has damaged the conceit of Love true and otherwise to such an extent that we sometimes do not even recognize ourselves.This is what is in fact the cause of this crusade and why there was a need to tell a story just so about suicide.The female provides for a rather mean spirited shallow gathering of the complaints of life and she does not provide anything in return only as perhaps an afterthought.One of the losses that this film provides for is that life is not blessed and though its event is seen to have been doing just fine since time began we are not given the real perception of a family but of a constructed set of circumstances in which we must perhaps make all these assumptions.The film is mean spirited because it purpose is to flatter you with the frilly crap and schooled as well as practiced smiles and laughs.The laughs though are of a sort not common to laughter but to the discourse of the study of the personality.The necessity to beat one's self by committing an act of suicide is the carrying card of the 20th Century.It false attributes as well as lies about anything this mis-guided soul provides for does not give the audience a value that is known or even one to be witnessed to.There is in effect no redemptive value only more of the same and we are sort of stuck as to what in tar nations is going on here.The film does not provide an identity as to the culprit of this malady and like the Power of Suggestion the margins are meant mostly to suggest that the human kind doesn't do very well as a slave or for that matter when it is under the yoke of a tyrant.It is this power that is in fact the power that they are unable to identify because it is the driving force behind this conception of death.

And then his wife (magnificently portrayed by Annabella Sciorra) commits suicide.

Besides any movie can look nice if you spend enough millions on it.Its story begins with Robin Williams and Annabela Scriora meeting, and they have kids, the kids die, their relationship crumbles, they go back together, and Robin Williams dies and goes to Heaven. His wife is so upset that she kills herself, and goes to hell because suicides go to hell. (With such a beautiful movie they have such ugly things like this in the story) So Robin Willams decides he can't live without her and wants to go to hell to get her...but NO Cuba Gooding jr. warns him that nobody has ever gone to hell to do that...GIVE ME A BREAK, this movie is based on the fact that Heaven has been in existence for thousands of years, and you're trying to tell me that NOBODY has EVER loved someone enough to do that? And besides as if people would just give up on a loved one like that, I HIGHLY doubt that you were the first mr. williams. And besides that the films philosophy is that when you die you go to your most happy and comfortable place, mr. williams goes to his wife's painting, while his wife rots away in hell.I think if maybe they toned down on the family **** then this could of been a good movie, but it ended up just making me mad.

Although Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. have turned in excellent performances elsewhere (One Hour Photo and Radio respectively), they didn't deliver here. Williamss giddy idiocy in his own personal Heaven, were too nauseating to watch. Gooding was positively imbecilic in his portrayal of Williams' guiding spirit. Annabella Sciorra was passable as Chris Nielsen's (Williams) long-suffering wife, and the dead-daughter-turned-Asian-flight-attendant (Rosalind Chao), was cute enough and had a very infectious laugh. But in the end, there just isn't enough talent to go around, and even if there was, there isn't much of a script to work with.2) Special effects (lack of.) I can hear the howls of protest already It was supposed to be ARTISTIC and SURREAL, not packed with the razzle-dazzle of modern computer pyrotechnics. Granted. But these, ahem, effects, were positively lame. The stomping-through-the-wet-paint-in-the-painting scenes were almost unbearable - like watching two hours of Blue's Clues. The people who were flying around in Leona's Heaven were just as silly - reminded me of the monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. 3) Plot. OK - I'll let Ford have a small amount of leeway on this, but even that isn't enough to make up for the storyline's inherent anemia. It's a New Ager's cornucopia of afterlife musings, none of which seem to make any sense. Ford's avoidance of endorsing any particular belief system about the afterlife is ultimately what causes the plot to implode. The whole idea of the rescue from Hell (which we might call it, according to Leona) just doesn't cut it. Rambo was more believable - for that matter, so was Alien 3, Ward's 1992 previous storyline effort.Do yourself a favor - skip this one. I wish I did.

But, interesting What Dreams May Come is not... It is beyond dull. I found myself yelling at my television for the film to finish.The 'plot' is simple.... Robin Williams' ideal life is ruined when his children are killed in a crash. He, himself is then killed in a crash and goes to heaven. His wife, back on Earth, can't cope with losing three members of her family, and commits suicide. She goes to Hell, and Robin Williams goes to the underworld to rescue his wife.It's a pathetic plot to stretch to two hours, this could easily have been a ten minute animated short. The ending is predictable, there's no narrative what-so-ever, annoyning characters. O.K, the visual effects in Heaven are impressive, but that really is the only good thing about the film.Williams is his usual, annoying, sympathetic, sensetive self. Cuba Gooding Jr is as irritating as a lost lottery ticket and lord only knows what the great Max Von Sydow's doing in this mess.So, I implore you.... DO NOT WATCH THIS.

With the help of The Tracker (Max Von Sydow), they eventually they reach this world of despair, but Chris cannot let her know who he is, so he pretends to be a neighbour in order to gain her trust, and get her out of this Hell she does not realise she forcing on herself. It should be mentioned in amongst the film are some flashbacks of Chris when he was alive with his wife and his son, but anyway, I can't remember how, but Chris does manage to get Annie out, and they live (dead) happily in their Heaven.

They were meant for each other, sharing everything in common, literally making them soul mates. When they got married and had children together, they seemingly had it all--until something drastic happened.Intrigued? So was I, at least near this point in the film. This is where Chris and Annie's children die in a tragic car accident. Then, as if this family was fated to doom, several years latter, Chris himself dies in a rather bizarre incidence trying to save a life. From this point on, the movie's script begins a roller coaster ride of ups and downs.After his death, Chris enters the afterlife of his own personal heaven; an unbelievably gorgeous place where everything in existence is composed of elements featured in his number one pastime, art. The visual atmosphere seen here is absolutely breathtaking in every way.There is the subject of hope presented to the audience as this film's overall message . I say the word subject because element or spirit would make it sound as if we are able to become involved in this emotional story. And we can't. That's too bad because the film has some strong power in its depth. A plot twist accumulates, however, when Chris detects that his wife, suppressed in depression and sorrow, has committed suicide and is banished to hell for her actions. Devastated, Chris defies the rules and seeks her out in the horrible territory Annie has gotten herself into. It is here where director Vincent Ward takes us into a stunning world of depraved loneliness, in which we set our sights upon numerous horrifying and imaginative things. Some of which are quite disturbing, and border a high MPAA rating. The features an overly long program length which is used to desperately try to hide the fact that there isn't any character development with bombarding us with flashbacks. Well, if the filmmakers would have taken a different approach at the character's history, lets say, putting the scenes in chronological order, instead of using flashbacks, which are bizarre and confusing, they may have had something with this material.What Dreams May Come is unpredictable and visually satisfying, but never really entertaining. In a way I wish it were, with such wonderful special effects are effective performances, it is a shame the film isn't better constructed.  Brought to you by Polygram Entertainment.

It is a wretched production meant to show a man in distress at loss of loved ones. Williams is very prone to sugar high sentimentality; it appears to be the book-end to his comic mania which is a real gift, ie fire 10 jokes in a minute and 5 will hit home. Vincent Ward must regret this one; Navigator was low key and much better. Avoid at all costs. It's a modern version of a weepie, and , it does not provide any of the insights such weepies are meant to contain as nuggets, so it's a dud.

(1) The movie falsely portrays the idea that there are unforgivable sins, which God will send us to hell for committing. --- There are no unforgivable sins, according to God, if we accept Jesus as our savior. Romans 81 confirms this by stating, 'So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.' So there is no punishment of eternal hell for those who accept Jesus. (2) The movie also falsely implies that we can cross over into hell to retrieve a lost soul. This is impossible, according to Luke 1626, which states, 'And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. Anyone who wanted to cross over to you from here is stopped at its edge, and no one there can cross over to us.' If you would like to be saved and live in heaven after your physical death, all you need to do is say these words, 'Jesus, come into my life. I accept your death on the cross as payment for my sins.' That is it! You are immediately saved and your name is written in the book of Life.

If we the living are supposed to know these things, I figure we'd all pretty much be able to see and know them for ourselves. As far as I'm aware, there's no living person who has full information on this metaphysical subject, so whatever one conjures up can't be either proven nor disproven.Still, dramatists continue to come up with other-worldly plots and imaginings.

It is a Robin Williams' movie, that's anything you need to know (ok, he's made some good films -Fisher King, Awakenings-, but he usually plays good-guy characters the good professor, the good psychiatrist, the good doctor...). This time he's a man with a so goddamn happy family who suffer the biggest of the tragedies the death of their two sons... From that moment on we leave this world and take a trip to the other one. Yeah, we break on through to the other side, but we don't find Morrison or Hendrix, we find what the writer thinks that heaven is (or the hell, or the land of the dead) ...

Years later she has overcome and is a successful painter.  Chris takes a detour to pick up some paintings for her but is killed in a car crash.  With an old friend Albert to guide him Chris explores his heaven that is based on Annie's paintings.  However back on earth Annie blames herself for everything and takes her own life.  When Chris finds this means she is sent to hell, he makes a journey into the depths of hell to find her and try and bring her back.Ask most people what's good about this film and not many will say the story.  The story starts so very well - watching Chris's despair at losing his wife and standing trying to communicate and seeing Annie's complete life come falling down almost had me in tears.  I really felt their grief and it was very moving.  This continues for most of the film but once Chris sets out on his journey it wasn't as moving.  I don't know why, but it didn't seem as real (duh!), the dialogue was poor and it all moved towards a bog-standard ending that didn't really move me.The problem is that the story relies on a bunch of American psycho-babble to move it along.  There is some good stuff in there - my favourite being that people's roles (father-son, boss-employee etc) can get in the way of people seeing who they are - but most of it doesn't work and sounds corny.  The story is still moving, but I felt that it would have been brilliant if the emotion of the first hour could have sustained.  Sadly it isn't.However the best thing about the film is the visual element.  Chris's heaven alone was beautiful - I could have walked there forever, where do you get the paintings they used? I want to have one!  The director's imagination doesn't work quite as well in hell but it still contains plenty of nightmarish visions that make up for the weak story.Robbins is quite good - he tones down his comedy act that made other films so sickly sweet (Patch Adams anyone?) and only occasionally does he seem out of place.  Sciorra is excellent - what an actress!  It takes real skill to shine on the Sopranos and she did!  Here her grief makes the film, although she's not as good at the end but that's because the story lets her down.  Gooding Jnr is OK but his character is a little daft - as is Sydow.Overall the star here is the director and he paints a picture that is at once beautiful beyond description and next a twisted metal hell full of suffering.  The emotion of the story fades but the visuals remain strong until the predictable happy ending.

As someone who loves unique visuals, great color, I was led to believe in previews that the super visual aspect of this movie would be major part of it - that this was going to be like nothing you ever seen! Well, some parts were, but precious few.What dominated, instead, was one of the dumbest stories and theologically- insulting ones to anyone who has any Biblical knowledge I have ever seen. I have should have known Hollywood would invent their own strange and weird version of heaven and hell. It's sad so many ignorant people buy into whatever Hollywood puts up on a big screen as being Truth, when it's usually the opposite they are seeing and hearing. This movie is a perfect example.Suffice to say, without going into all the details, people are using the Lord's name in vain in heaven; God is mentioned only once and that of a distant person somewhere up there and the main theology preached is re- incarnation. Secular humanism also is prevalent and in this movie, if you set your mind to it, you can bring your loved ones up from hell to heaven! Wow, who needs Jesus? Not people in the film world, that's for sure.No wonder this film bombed. Even the agnostics and atheists who are our national film critics knew this movie was stupid. "},{"Title":"Afterlife lite","Date":"15 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  About as much thought went into the afterlife depicted here as goes into the average person's theology.  Heaven is a place where time has no meaning... except that things happen after other things, just like they do everywhere else, and when Robin Williams goes to rescue his wife from Hell he is told that he has three minutes.  This can't be because of any metaphysical distinction between Heaven and Hell.  They are simply parts of the same place, coloured differently by their different inhabitants.  Apparently, we make our own Heaven and Hell in the afterlife; which is to say, our desires create things around us.  -Or at least, our desires can create plants, inanimate objects, and birds, but not, for some reason, humans - Williams can't summon his wife to his side simply by wishing for her, even though he has this power over his pet dog (like many movie dogs, it ceases to exist when it isn't required by anyone) and, it turns out, his children.  But his wife committed suicide, and suicides can't get into Heaven.Why not?  It's not that God keeps them out, since God doesn't exist.  (At one point someone says, What about God? and Cuba Gooding replies Oh, he's up there, somewhere, shouting down at us that he loves us, wondering why we don't hear him... but this is pure drivel you wouldn't take such a fatuous statement seriously if you heard it while you were alive, and you wouldn't take it seriously if you heard it after you were dead, either.)  The reason suicides can't get into Heaven has SOMETHING to do with the fact that they don't know they're dead.  I'm thinking why not?  They PLANNED their deaths, in some cases methodically; you'd think they'd stand a better chance of realising they've died than someone who died in her sleep, or a fellow who was suddenly hit by a bus.  But no suicides violated the natural order, which means that they're in denial of that fact.  What natural order?  Why are all suicides (ALL suicides) in denial of violating it?  And why is any of this relevant?  Oh, never mind let's just grant that suicides can't enter heaven; drop the mumbo-jumbo, and move on.  But the film refuses to.  Instead of just allowing us to SEE Heaven, and draw our own conclusions, someone has to insult our intelligence by explaining everything (usually with a good deal of superfluous, teeth-clenching earnestness), and to add injury to that insult, the explanation never makes any sense.  (The second silliest metaphysical moment when Cuba Gooding explains how it is that people can continue to exist after they're dead by saying, You can survive without an arm or a leg.  Why not without your entire body?  This is wacky enough to be charming, until he goes on and on in the same vein, and we realise he's serious.)Enough with the metaphysics.  How's the movie?  Answer equally bad.  Some people found the afterlife scenes attractive to look at, and I suppose they were, but they weren't THAT attractive they were overly glossy - in much the same way that the non-afterlife scenes were, so there wasn't even much of a contrast - they did NOT wear their CGI origins lightly, and the sense that they were inspired by REAL paintings just wasn't there, apart from the fact that they bore an unfortunate resemblance to the views of Paradise Earth offered in Jehovah's Witness pamphlets.  Also, the use of fade-to-white instead of fade-to-black is pretentious.  It means nothing and hurts our eyes.Worst of all are the characters.  Williams and Sciorra played a couple of soulmates people more closely connected to one another than any other two people for, I don't know, centuries.  You'd never know it from merely seeing them together.  There's so little REAL contact between them that when Williams refuses to be happy without Sciorra, and Sciorra refuses to be happy without Williams, it comes across as something as unhealthy as heroine addiction - although come to think of it, the two are so obsessive that this would be true even if they WERE soulmates.  And Williams is just obnoxious.  Not once is he even civil when someone advises him to do anything he doesn't already want to do, or says something (however innocent) he doesn't want to hear.  He's the kind of person who throws a tantrum when his doctor refuses to prescribe the drug he wants.
