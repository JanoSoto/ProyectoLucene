[{"Title":"Can't Help Falling In Love With Hawaii","Date":"4 September 2005","Score":"23 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":" Blue Hawaii, the title song of this film, was originally from the score of another Paramount film Waikiki Wedding which starred Bing Crosby in 1937. Bing sold a few records of that one, albeit they were 78s back then, and Elvis nicely revives it and sells a few more. Crosby's film was made to take advantage of a whole lot of publicity he received for a trip to Hawaii. But Paramount as they usually did with his films back they made them on the cheap and Hawaii for Waikiki Wedding was recreated on the back lot.Bing must have been a little jealous and who could have blamed him when Paramount did this film completely on location in Hawaii for the King. And Elvis got to go back to Hawaii for another film in Paradise, Hawaiian Style. Elvis got a whole lot of musical numbers here including the title tune which he sings over the opening credits. He does a rockabilly version of the French song Alouette and with different lyrics, the Mexican love ballad, La Paloma. And he borrows a hit from Andy Williams when he reprises the Hawaiian Wedding Song. Of course no film set in Hawaii is complete without Aloha Oe. But the big song from this film is one of Presley's greatest Can't Help Falling In Love With You. He sings it during a scene for a birthday party for Joan Blackman's grandmother. It's sort of done in a throwaway manner like the producer's didn't think it would be the big number in the film. It might surprise Presley fans that this blockbuster hit was also recorded by another RCA Victor artist named Perry Como for one of his albums. Perry does a nice job with it, but it ain't a patch on the King's version.Elvis is a rich young kid who'd like very much to get out from under Mom and Dad and prove himself. He's even done a hitch in the army, but that doesn't help. Parents are played by Roland Winters and Angela Lansbury.Angela Lansbury recounted a story where she and her husband had dinner with Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis when they were casting Blue Hawaii. She said Elvis was a nice, polite young man who barely said three words during the dinner. The talk was all from Colonel Tom who was making all kinds of offers to the future Jessica Fletcher to be in this film. Angela's career was somewhat in a dry spell, she hadn't made The Manchurian Candidate yet or appeared on Broadway in Mame. So she was quite willing to appear.I gained some insight into how Colonel Parker handled Elvis with that story. If you look at the cast and even the behind the camera credits of his films, you'll see them populated with a whole lot of Hollywood veterans. I'll bet there were many such dinners during Elvis's film career.To be sure Presley was certainly the Colonel's meal ticket. But I would have to say that he made every effort to see that Elvis and his films were given the best possible production values. I think that's why the King had a long sustained film career until public tastes change which they inevitably do. Also musicals, even Elvis's became too cost prohibitive to produce any more.Blue Hawaii marks the height of Presley's singing and film career. The Beatles hadn't come on the scene yet, the King was still ruling the roost on the record charts and his films were grossing big box office. And unless your Bing Crosby and feel a twinge of jealousy that his Hawaii film was done on the cheap, you'll like Blue Hawaii very much. It's nice entertainment from a great entertainer.

'Blue Hawaii' is the one that certainly hit the highs with it's blend of comedy, romance, music, scenery and a bevvy of beauties! This film laid down the blueprint for the majority of Elvis' other 60's musicals that each and every Company, writer, producer and director, tried to recapture and remake time and again. But, artistically, it never quite happened. The water was tested with Presley's first post-army movie, the critically acclaimed 'G.I. Blues', the year before, that introduced us to the new Elvis look and feel. The family audience were captured by Tom Parker's crafty, but clever, plans to make his boy appeal to a much wider spectrum of tastes and trends. And, 'Blue Hawaii' established firmly which route 'The King's' film career path was going to take.It is an absolute must-see for a number of things including the fine direction of Norman Taurog and the beautiful Hawaiian paradise that unfolds like a travelogue. But, most importantly we are treated to a more mature Elvis Presley who handles his character's script with notable impressive comic timing when feeding off the intimidating characterisation by Angela Lansbury who plays his domineering mother.Elvis seemed to gain a lot of enthusiasm and incentive by working with a fine supporting cast e.g. 'Jailhouse Rock', 'King Creole', 'Flaming Star', 'Wild In The Country', and 'Blue Hawaii' is no exception to the rule. The immediate screen chemistry between himself and his beautiful co-star, Joan Blackman, portraying the couple in love, is quite in evidence here and they both play off each other amicably. Although, rumour had it, it was a different ball game off camera.An Elvis movie wouldn't be an Elvis movie if he didn't chant his way through a number of songs and with 'Blue Hawaii' this culminated in a total of fourteen that made up a soundtrack that was to become one of his biggest selling albums ever. These songs blended the local islands traditional themes('Aloha-oe', 'Ku-u-i-po', 'Island of Love'), with silly production tunes('Ito Eats' and 'Almost Always True') and a taste of the new movie-style rock 'n' roll numbers ('Rock-A-Hula Baby' and 'Slicin' Sand') through to the beautiful ballads that Elvis' remarkably crafted operatic voice of this time, handles with consummate skill and ease ('Blue Hawaii', 'No More' and 'Can't Help Falling In Love'). The film's finale is a cinematic classic and beautifully filmed with Elvis once again in tremendous form with those golden vocal chords-Wonderful! This film was made at the start of a different era of the Rock music phenomenon, and afterall it was Hollywood, so not all of the Hawaiian flavoured ditties will suite everyone's taste. But, it just went to prove no matter what kind of song Elvis sang and released it would still boost sales to the point of gold record certified! Elvis' performance as homecoming G.I. turned 'beach bum', Chad Gates, is flawless in this movie and obviously shows us that he has a flair for this kind of comedy setting. The film itself when viewed today is still as fresh and feel-good as it ever was which is more than can be stated of the much later so-called sequel-'Paradise Hawaiian Style' and other such Presley vehicles as 'Girl Happy', 'Tickle Me', 'Harum Scarum', 'Easy Come, Easy Go', 'Double Trouble' and 'Clambake'. All of which try to recreate the 'Blue Hawaii' formula albeit in a bad way with Elvis displaying his acting and singing talents in a mediocre sort of way.But, finally, for all it's class and high points, 'Blue Hawaii', in the long run, was certainly the 'Kiss of Death' for 'The King', and his acting ability and enthusiasm for the big screen would never be portrayed as consistently ever again.

Ms. Lansbury has constantly degraded this movie but she made a wonderful appearance as Elvis's mother, and I am sure gave her new fans. This movie was also responsible along with Hawaii Five-O as giving tourism to the Islands a big boost, but have the Hawaiian Tourist Bureau ever mentioned this. 40 years on it is still a treat to watch,and still surpasses some of today's so called hot movies.Due to the popularity of Blue Hawaii El's management told him this was the way to go.Such a shame.

This is a really fun film with some great numbers. I have always been partial to Rock A Hula - it's exuberant, it's sexy, it's Elvis. This film also features Can't Help Falling in Love and the Hawaiian Wedding Song. Angela Lansbury has a great turn as Elvis' southern mother.This film, with its big budget and great soundtrack, laid the groundwork for the Elvis movies made later. Unfortunately, as Parker had negotiated a percentage of each film, it didn't take him long to realize that the faster and cheaper they made them, the more money for him and, by extension, Elvis. In fact, later on, the songs done in the films were not specifically written for the particular film - they were simply unreleased songs that were bundled into an album as the movie soundtrack.But when you see Blue Hawaii, don't dwell on any of that. Just enjoy the scenery and the young, healthy Elvis, with his whole post-Army life ahead of him. All 17 years of it.

Hawaii has never looked better before or since, showcased by beautiful, panoramic shots in this movie. Here, it's a relentlessly wholesome place, a mirror image of the seamy underside shown in Hawaii Five-O years later. Tourist-trap native traditions are given special attention. Day or night, it's so intoxicating that it almost makes you want to immediately hop a plane to Honolulu or to Kauai, the island of love.The soundtrack is quite possibly the best of any Elvis movie, with such gems as Can't Help Falling In Love, the toe-tapping Rockahula, Hawaiian Wedding Song and an abbreviated but still enjoyable rendition from Elvis of the traditional Hawaiian classic, Aloha Oe. Unlike virtually every other musical, they never break into song for no good reason. Whether it's to change the subject, serenade a grandmother on her birthday, or liven up a party, there's always a radio or band present rather than having the music come out of nowhere.Elvis was in top form here - handsome, slim, and boyish. A far cry from the overweight, ostentatious, muttonchopped, rhinestoned, caped and bell-bottomed joke he became a decade later. The rest of the cast was good, with the exception of an over-the-top Angela Lansbury and a cold, unmusical Joan Blackman. Still, the love story was one of the better ones, with the relationship established before the movie opens instead of the ridiculous whirlwind romance of most other Elvis movies.Watch this on the biggest screen TV to get the feeling you're actually in this Hawaii that never was, at least during the outdoor scenes, not when they retreated to the studio. Better yet, make it a double feature with Gidget Goes Hawaiian and you can luxuriate in the Hawaii of 1961, only two years after it had become the 50th state.

In 1961, Elvis went there to film the first in his trilogy to Hawaii, Blue Hawaii. I wrote the plot summary, so I won't go through what it is about. I will say that it is the only musical he is really good at because it was the original that was then followed by several imitations...all done by Elvis.Elvis wanted to be a real actor in a film with bite, but this was as close as he would come. The script is light and fun, the acting is good and there are a few songs that aren't that embarassing to The King. Joan Blackman is great as his girl, Maile (I couldn't picture Juliet Prowse in the role since she looked too strong for the character). Angela Lansbury is hilarious in the role of his mother. She says it was a low point in her career, but in truth the chemistry she has with the rest of the cast is good. It is also full of breathtaking scenery. Even the interiors that were filmed in Hollywood don't look bargain budget.Sadly, Elvis would make more of the same after this. Viva Las Vegas comes close to the greatness Blue Hawaii had, but Tom Parker didn't care as he just wanted to hear 'cha-ching'. Elvis just wasn't strong enough to say 'no' to Parker. Elvis was better than the movies he was in, and if he did the remake of 'A Star Is Born', that would've changed everything.Everytime I watch this, I get happy but also sad at the same time. His performance is very good and it makes me wonder what might could have been if he didn't do all those formula films.

His parents would love him to work a sensible job at his father's pineapple business (!) but all Presley wants to do is have a good time, so he becomes a tour guide (ho-hum). G.I. BLUES was fun and, when we consider all Presley's films in production order, it worked well as a romantic comedy on its own. But BLUE HAWAII was really the film that would take Elvis into a silly direction for most of his future movies in the '60s. He doesn't seem as interested as he was in previous roles, and now we also get a heaping helping of corny twangy throwaway Hawaiian songs from the King, with embarrassing titles like Ito Eats. One saving grace music-wise is his featured classic tune Can't Help Falling in Love, but unfortunately it's an abbreviated version and is sung to an old lady. Angela Lansbury puts in a good effort as Presley's flighty mom, but it doesn't help matters any. I do, in fact, enjoy some of Elvis' later goofy 1960s fun flicks for what they are, but this one was just too standard and aimless. ** out of **** "},{"Title":"one of his best","Date":"16 August 2001","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":"  This is one of his all time best movies.

Turned down she steals a jeep, crashes it by the beach, runs into the water (I guess to drown herself). Of course Elvis shows up and rescues her. He administers a spanking which straightens out I guess. The main cast are all proved old timey type actors and do a great job. I did find Angela Lansbury's role to grate some because of the poor Southern accent and the fact that she played Elvis's mother but was only ten years older than him at the time.

This one ranks solidly in the top of the good category. Like Fun in Acapulco and Viva Las Vegas, there's some great scenery, good music, and a plot that holds interest pretty much all the way through.Cinematography takes top honors. Hawaii has hardly ever looked so good.Presley interacts well with the natives and does a good job convincing us that he could be a native boy. He seems fit and comfortable with everything and everyone in the movie.The movie seems more crowded with Presley songs than usual, hardly five minutes goes by before there's another one. Fortunately, they're generally pleasant with an Hawaiian or in one case Jamaican flavor. The song Can't Help Falling in Love with You is one of Presley's greatest and unfortunately it is more or less a throwaway here, with Presley singing it to his girlfriend's grandmother more than her.Definitely a must see for Elvis fans and a watchable one for non-Elvis fans.I watched this on the day that the writer Hal Kantner died.

I think that title actually fits better. The tagline says it all for this flick with romance, dances and paradise. That almost fits any of The King's formula movies. This movie catches up with Elvis as he gets out of the Army (in the movies) and wants to get on with his life. His family has one idea but he wants to make it on his own. Don't feel sorry for him as his life is full of surfing, babes and the beach.Unfortunately for the audience, Presley's co-star in G.I. Blues in 1960 pulled out of this movie. Juliet Prowse who starred with Elvis in G.I. Blues would have made a great followup character to add in Blue Hawaii. The story goes that she made so many demands on the studio that she was dropped from the picture. She continued in movies and then mostly in television. She later guest starred in a Murder She Wrote staring Angela Lansbury; Lansbury plays Elvis mother in this picture (she was 35 at the time). Blue Hawaii was the most successful soundtrack albums of the Elvis movie genre. Like the other Elvis movies the reason to see this one is Elvis himself and the great music performances he gives. Elvis retuned to Hawaii many times so this must have been a special film for him. Hal Wallis does his usual excellent job of framing this film in his talented way that fuses the music with the story without being too sappy. This is a must see film on the Elvis list. ***/****.As for the poster&#133; The half sheet of Blue Hawaii is more popular that the one sheet. Mainly this is due to the large musical note that Elvis is singing on top of with the girls. I like the one sheet better with the surfboard but both posters are just great.

Elvis Presley, playing Chad Gates, was a little wooden with his acting but I heard from a friend that the director just wanted Presley to play himself. Joan Blackman, playing Maile Duval, was just a lot of fun and a good actress. The scene where the motorcycle cop catches up to her on a highway in Hawaii and starts to bawl her out for speeding, like a number of times before, and then changes his mind when, his friend, Maile, tells him that her boyfriend is coming home from the Army, is charming. The motorcycle cop gives Maile an escort (including siren) to the airport to pick up Chad Gates. And when Chad Gates tries to make Maile jealous when Chad is getting off the plane, by kissing the stewardess, that was funny and charming. Another charming moment is when Chad and Maile are making out on the beach and a little Hawaiian boy comes up to them and asks them if he can play the game and when Chad tells the little boy he's too young, the little boy is persistent and asks Chad if he can play if he can get a little girl to play the game with him. My girlfriend especially likes the music box scene where Chad Gates, played by Elvis Presley, sings I Can't Help Falling in Love with You to Maile's grandmother. We own the DVD of Blue Hawaii and I use the scene selection to get to that scene and my girlfriend and I watch that chapter over and over again. Angela Landsbury, playing Chad Gate's mother is enjoyable and she's a good actress. Jennie Maxwell, playing Ellie Corbett was a thoroughly enjoyable over-sexed brat. My girlfriend always says, What a brat! when she sees Jennie Maxwell in this film. When Chad Gates gives Ellie Corbett a spanking on the beach at night, it's both funny and a little sexy, as far as I'm concerned. The spanking straightens Ellie out and she's more manageable the rest of the film. The scene where the teenage girls invade Chad Gate's room at night and drive him nuts and then, when the school teacher comes in and tries to get romantic with him, are hilarious! Since we purchased this DVD, my girlfriend and I have watched it a number of times and will watch it a lot more. We even took this DVD to the local hospital to let my girlfriend's mother watch it. My girlfriends mother just had major heart surgery and she has been to, and loves Hawaii and she's been to Graceland (Elvis' home). My girlfriend's mother, who is 82, was entranced by this movie and I'm sure it helped her recover from her operation. I'd rate this movie high because it's so enjoyable.

This film is a joy to watch, with lovely on-location photography and some of Elvis' better songs including his classic Can't Help Falling in Love.The story is a sparse affair concerning Chad, a returned G.I. who wants to make his own way in life but whose overbearing mother (Angela Lansbury, great as usual) wants only to hear of him working in the family's pineapple business. Chad figures out a way to get a job with a tourist agency taking advantage of his knowledge of the islands, but a crisis involving one of his underage charges threatens to cut his new career short.The film itself is better than the average Elvis film, not so much because of any redeeming themes or ideas (i.e. King Creole) but moreso because the script gives the characters witty dialog and the narrative exposition is just heavy enough to keep the audience interested without becoming absurdly dramatic. For example one line that always gets a laugh from an audience is when Chad is trying to convince the schoolteacher that he will be a good tour guide, and she asks him Mr Gates, are you sure you can handle a teacher and 4 teenage girls?. Just the line itself gets a laugh. This movie has a lot of humor that works very well, it's not like you're sitting there saying oh look at what Elvis is doing; a lot of the comedy are situations that would be funny with any decent comedian. Here, as in just a few of his later films like Follow that Dream, Elvis gets to show he has real ability and good timing for comedy.The narrative structure itself is fairly effective in terms of drawing the audience in -- always a tough job with a story that has so little action and drama. First we're presented with a fairly standard parents vs. kid dramatic story as described above, and then when we meet the tourists there is another important character, the teenage tease Ellie Corbett. She's a rich kid's daughter who feels unloved and is a bit of a JD if you know what I mean. She doesn't want to go see the pineapple farm, she doesn't want to learn to surf, and she doesn't want to attend a hookie-lau. The audience perhaps identifies with her in some sense, and the elements in the audience that want to resist the urge to enjoy this Hawaiian treat are overcome by way of Ms. Corbett's objections being gradually over-ruled. Also she represents a key in the narrative for Chad -- although she initially creates a romantic confusion between Chad and his girlfriend, eventually it's Chad's ability to reach out to her that proves his maturity and his ability at his job. This takes his character beyond the parent vs. child dichotomy and into the world of maturity, where we leave him.

Three of whom are smitten with the dashing, singing Elvis. The other, a stroppy spoilt girl not interested in the trip at all... Although popular amongst Elvis fans, particularly female Elvis fans, it's not one of my favourites at all. Even the soundtrack is lacklustre. Three great songs - the title track, 'No More' and of course 'Can't Help Falling in Love' but several very poor songs such as 'Ito Eats' and 'Slicin Sand' (both totally unnecassary to the scenes anyway, as there are already songs played around them.)

It's good natured undemanding fun and therein lies it's charm. For me this is one of his better films and features a pretty good cast including Angela Lansbury as Elvis's mom. His love interest is played by Joan Blackman who even by Elvis girl standards is incredibly beautiful and who puts in a charming performance. There are a few laughs to be had and a few memorable scenes. The only downside for me was the quality of the songs which with a few exceptions weren't the greatest. This will likely appeal mainly to fans of Elvis but even those with just a passing interest in him can find some enjoyment from this fun movie. "},{"Title":"Pleasant Enough Elvls Movie","Date":"11 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":" Jumping Jacks director Norman Taurog's romantic musical comedy Blue Hawaii was Elvis's eighth movie, and the second of the nine movies that he helmed with Presley. Taurog was no stranger to comedy, and he had directed some Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis comedies. This lightweight contemporary melodrama, with race relations and class tensions simmering just beneath the surface, casts Elvis as a young man who has completed his tour of military service in the Army. Obviously, nobody can question his patriotism. Clad Gates (Elvis Presley) has been flown home to his parents in Hawaii. Chad's zany mother Sarah Lee Gates (Angela Lansbury of The Manchurian Candidate) and his father Fred Gates (Roland Winters of Charlie Chan franchise) expect Elvis to take control of the business. Unfortunately, they have a laundry list of don'ts that our hero refuses to tolerate. First, his mother wants him to marry a white Anglo Saxon, while Chad has his eyes on a half-breed, part French and part Hawaiian lady named Maile Duval (Joan Blackman of Kid Galahad). Sarah doesn't want her son mingling with the island natives, least of all marrying one. Boy is she in for a surprise! Rather than work for his father, Chad goes to work at a travel agency where Maile works. Maile's boss Mr. Chapman (Howard McNear of Anatomy of a Murder) hires him and then fires him after he starts a brawl in a bar with another tourist, Tucker Garvey (Steve Brodie), and winds up in jail. The rowdy free-for-all roundhouse is the only one of its kind in Blue Hawaii. Our hero has his hand filled with girls. Not only must be contend with his girlfriend, but also he has been hired as a tour guide to a mature school teacher, Abigail Prentice (Nancy Walters) and three girls. One of the girls is rebellious, suicidal, but definitely attracted to the protagonist, and she gives our hero a hard time. Eventually, Chad brings his mother around to appreciating the natives of Hawaii and he marries Maile in a sumptuous wedding with a beautiful ceremonial barge. Blue Hawaii benefits from Charles Lang's gorgeous cinematography and some of the most stunning scenery. Angela Lansbury gives a stand-out performance as Elvis' mother. Altogether, Blue Hawaii is an average epic with the star warbling several chart-topping songs.

That being said, one of the best of Elvis' films because 1. It really was filmed in Hawaii, and some of the scenery is gorgeous. 2. Joan Blackman, his Hawaiian girlfriend and fiancé, is also gorgeous. 3. Some of the best songs ever, including Can't Help Falling in Love With You. Best selling soundtrack of all the Elvis pictures. 4. The restored widescreen version takes the excess blueness out of the color tint. 5. The beautiful Hawaiian Wedding Song and the wedding at The Coco Palms Resort. They had to float the scene twice as the actual lagoon was that short.Negatives 1. Some really bad acting by most of the supporting actors. Angela Landsbury's accent and acting is atrocious. 2. The houseboy Ping Pong is an obvious Aisian stereotype. 3. Elvis'boss, who went on to play Floyd the Barber on The Andy Griffith Show, is terrible. 4. Many stupid scenes Ito pigs out at the fishing luau. The spoiled rich girl runs into the ocean to drown herself, followed by that infamous spanking by Elvis. 5.That horrible jailhouse scene with a stupid Pineapple in the Can song. 6. Elvis' acting isn't' so hot either. Very wooden.I stayed at The Coca Palms in 1979, and the rooms really did look like exactly like that. The window screens were removed for the filming, but without them, the bugs would eat you alive! It still remains as one of the best Elvis films ever because of the (good) songs and scenery alone. "},{"Title":"The first Elvis film remastered for DVD","Date":"2 July 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":" The first Elvis film to have a widely marketed DVD remastering, it represents his most frequent nonsense cinematic plot, about the heir to a wealthy and powerful family's money and connections hiding out at a resort to find a girl interested in more than just his family connections and wealth. Released in 1961, it puffs up location shots on Oahu and Elvis at his most machismo appearing in elegant suits, upscale resort wear and at his best physical tone ever in the skimpiest swimwear the censors would allow. Angela Lansbury, playing a rare turn for her as a physical comic marrying earlier her chauffeur in Atlanta and flying to Oahu to live and raise Elvis, has the only other superstar turn. There are more songs packed in than usual, two actually lyric rewrites of classic melodies and none representing Elvis' most famous contributions to the music world. The major money maker of his long film career, most of the storyboard is bot pleasant and enticing. The exception is the scene in which Elvis is expected to be the tour guide and chaperone of four teenage girls on vacation on the island, unaware their chaperone is the secret fiancée of Elvis' father's American mainland boss. Some of the tense sequences, when a young charge acts out by climbing into Elvis' bed to then bait Elvis into spending time behind bars when his fists fly at a hotel bar to then crash a stolen jeep as an underage driver on the lam, seem a bit to R rated and too melodramatic for the flow of a mild comedy with a mild romantic fantasy ending.

Chad Gates returns to his home in Hawaii, where his wealthy parents want him to go to work at his father's Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company. Chad, however, would rather spend his days surfing and hanging out at the beach with his friends and his pretty half-Hawaiian girlfriend Maile (pronounced Miley). He realises, however, that he needs to take up some sort of occupation, so he starts as a tour guide at the travel agency where Maile works. His first assignment is to show a schoolmistress and a group of her teenage students around the island and complications ensue when both the teacher, Abigail, and Ellie, one of her pupils, fall for Chad. It has been said that this film set the tone for Elvis Presley's future film career; a musical romantic comedy featuring pretty locations, prettier girls, mediocre songs and banal plots. Several of his later films would also fit this formula, including his two others set in Hawaii, Girls! Girls! Girls! and Paradise, Hawaiian Style. (Presley did not spend all his time working for the Hawaii tourist board; he was equally ready to offer his services to other prime holiday destinations, hence the likes of Fun in Acapulco or Viva Las Vegas). None of these films made any great demands on his acting skills, and in Blue Hawaii he is (as he often was) so laid-back as to be practically horizontal. Although Elvis was, in chronological terms, still young (only 26) when he made this film, he was, in career terms, already middle-aged. Gone was the hip-swivelling Elvis the Pelvis of the mid-fifties, the wild young rock-and-roller denounced from pulpits all across America as a danger to the morals of the nation's youth. In his place was Elvis the lounge singer, a younger, better-looking version of Frank Sinatra or Bing Crosby, crooning a string of bland, middle-of-the-road easy- listening numbers, in this film often with a vaguely Hawaiian flavour. Only occasionally does he break into anything resembling rock-and-roll. The only memorable song here is his well-known hit Can't Help Falling in Love, and even that is a gentle romantic ballad, unlikely to be denounced from the pulpit of even the most censorious preacher. In some of Elvis' films his leading ladies were well-known actresses, such as Ursula Andress in Fun in Acapulco or Ann-Margret in Viva Las Vegas, but here his love interest is the attractive but obscure Joan Blackman. The only other actor of any celebrity in the movie is Angela Lansbury who plays Chad's mother Sarah Lee. Lansbury started her career in the mid forties playing pretty young things, but by the time of Blue Hawaii she had settled down into what was to be her normal niche of playing women considerably older than her actual age. (In 1961 she was 36, only ten years older than Elvis himself). She plays Sarah Lee with an exaggerated, stagey southern drawl; the Gates family are supposed to have moved to Hawaii from Georgia, a detail presumably inserted to explain away Elvis' own southern accent, but Sarah Lee ends up speaking with a quite different accent from either her son or her husband. Lansbury later rated her performance here as one of the worst in her career and it is hard to disagree with her. Blue Hawaii was clearly intended as wholesome family entertainment, but there are two points at which it might cause some raising of eyebrows today. The first is the (presumably) unintentional double entendre which occurs when Maile asks Chad whether he can satisfy a teacher and four teenagers. The second comes when Chad picks Ellie up, puts her across his knee and gives her a good spanking. Ellie is, admittedly, an obnoxiously spoilt and sulky little brat, seventeen going on six- it is not hard to see why Chad prefers the more placid Maile- but even so such behaviour would today count as either sexual harassment or criminal assault. Perhaps in the early sixties there was a clause in Hawaiian state law permitting tour guides to administer corporal punishment to unruly teenagers.My copy of Blue Hawaii is a DVD recently given away free as part of a newspaper promotion, which suggests that there must still be a market for this sort of thing, as they are hardly going to give away films that nobody wants to watch. Presumably that market consists of die-hard subjects of King Elvis, especially the older generation who can still remember him in his prime. I suspect that were it not for the presence of the great man Blue Hawaii would be just another long-forgotten cheesy sixties beach movie. 5/10 "},{"Title":"The Blueprint for Mediocrity","Date":"18 April 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":" Fresh out of the U.S. Army, singing and guitar-strumming Elvis Presley (as Chadwick Chad Gates) returns to his Hawaiian island home, and pretty sweetheart Joan Blackman (as Maile Duval). On you, wet is my favorite color, Mr. Presley tells Ms. Blackman, but he is tempted by other beautiful women in bathing suits. Presley also resists settling down as heir to his family's pineapple business, much to the chagrin of mother Angela Lansbury (as Sarah Lee). Ms. Lansbury cries, What did I do wrong? Blowing all previous Presley pictures out of the water at the box office, Blue Hawaii pretty much set the stage for the Elvis travelogue movie, unfortunately. It isn't the best of the lot, but the combination of the lush locales and Hawaiian-flavored soundtrack has an undeniably intoxicating effect. It's positively sleep-inducing. The soundtrack spent a whopping twenty weeks at #1 on the charts. Classic single Can't Help Falling in Love / Rock-a-Hula Baby hit #1 around the world. Though not a single in America, No More followed it to #1 in a few areas, also. Presley's rendition of Hawaiian Wedding Song and the title track are classics in their own way. It's too bad all the financial success didn't embolden anyone to take a few more chances with Presley as an actor - although, to be fair, he looks neither willing nor able herein.**** Blue Hawaii (11/22/61) Norman Taurog ~ Elvis Presley, Joan Blackman, Angela Lansbury, Roland Winters "},{"Title":"exceptionally beautiful Elvis movie","Date":"22 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":" Lush photography, gorgeous scenery, great orchestrations and a 1961 Hawaiian setting that allows for genuine visual travelogue marvels, BLUE HAWAII with a handsome and effervescent 26 year old Elvis is probably one of the top 3 1960s Elvis films he made. Others are right in comments on this site that BLUE HAWAII is a blessing and a curse in that it was so successful it set a template for the rest of his films that simply re treaded the formula this one invented. BLUE HAWAII is exceptional in that it is a really gorgeous film to look at. On a massive screen and especially in a drive in it must have been visually magnetic, and in a huge cinema with a big crowd would have played like a real party. Elvis shows what good comic timing he had, had adapts to light romantic acting roles easily. The story is fairly trite and the female leads are uninteresting except for a really silly turn by Angela Lansbury as, believe it or not, his mother. Ex-Charlie Chan actor Roland Winters plays his dad! Joan Blackman as his main romantic lead is not appealing at all and it is obvious how little spark there is between them. Beautiful interior art direction and snazzy restaurant scenes, wonderful garden scenes and a wedding flat finale that is genuinely moving, BLUE HAWAII is undemanding and transporting and deserves a place with VIVA LAS VEGAS and LOVING YOU as his top three Technicolor films of the era. It is a really beautiful looking film with a happy relaxed Elvis and it shows. BLUE HAWAII even gets away with same jaw dropping risqué dialog between a female chaperone of some high school girls who asks him to be their guide adding; do you think you can satisfy a school teacher and 4 teenage girls? also during a fight scene in a restaurant a drunk calls him a 'faggot' before Elvis punches him.

Angela Lansbury (playing Elvis' mother!) slips too easily into caricature, possibly to help compensate for her miscasting; Joan Blackman is an entirely forgettable love-interest. Presley himself looks rather bored, and even his songs are mediocre.

This doesn't sit too well with Chad because he wants to make his mark on the world by himself but with a little assistance from his girl (Joan Blackman). This is a pretty disappointing film for the music legend as it offers him very little in terms of the ability to show off a performance as the screenplay is so weak and juvenile that just about anyone could have played the lead. There's some good stuff scattered around but for the most part the screenplay doesn't have enough in it to last the entire running time of the film. As I've said, the biggest problem is the screenplay, which delivers a bunch of lame and obnoxious characters. We see Elvis having to deal with his mother as well as an older woman with a group of teenage girls including one (Jenny Maxwell) who thinks she's older than she is. I'm sure these characters were written with humor in mind but all of them come off very forced and obnoxious. These supporting characters really brought the film down even though the actual performers are rather good at bringing these obnoxious people to life. Elvis is decent in the role but it never seemed like he was too interested in the material. He has that typical charm of his but nothing he does ever really jumped out at me. Blackman makes for an attractive lead but she can't add anything else to the movie. The film features the classic Can't Help Falling in Love but outside of that I found the music to be quite lame. The various love songs to Hawaii were rather embarrassing as the musical numbers were poorly and lazily handled.
