Not very fond of any of the others. The Return of the Pink Panther just has it all in my opinion. You get a crime story, funny/stupid humor, Clouseau who still has no idea of what's going on(this just makes the movie what it is).The fight between Clouseau and Kato in the apartment is hilarious. One has to wonder how long Kato was waiting in the refrigerator. The fight is just very slapstick and clumsy that it makes me and my girlfriend laugh every time we see it. Another great point of the film is the numerous cars that Clouseau goes through. Loosing a few into a pool. The mental breakdown of Herbert Lom's character is also one of the film's fine points. This is -- my opinion -- the funniest of the series. I have always enjoyed it, and most likely will always enjoy it.

And so it is that `The Return Of The Pink Panther' is entrusted to none other than the inimitable Inspector (Peter Sellers) from France, much to the chagrin of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who, knowing what unbridled mayhem Clouseau is really capable of, would like nothing more than to be rid of him once and for all.  But such a request from the sovereign authorities of a friendly nation cannot be denied, and Clouseau is therefore dispatched with all haste to Lugash, with orders to bring the criminals to justice, and insure that the case is indeed-- to quote Clouseau-- `solv-ed.' 	Some ten years had passed since director Blake Edwards and Sellers had teamed up for the brilliant film `A Shot In The Dark,' before coming together once again for this third installment chronicling the misadventures of the `belov-ed' Inspector Clouseau.  But the wait was certainly worth it.  Cleverly written and delivered, it affords Sellers ample opportunities to do what he does best  Make you laugh.  Whether affecting an alias in disguise or forthrightly confronting the usual suspects, Clouseau deftly uncovers every `ploy' attempted by the unscrupulous thieves he seeks.  There are moments so hilarious that even co-star Catherine Schell (Claudine) has trouble keeping a straight face at times; but rather than being a distraction (as you'd think it would be), it somehow makes it even funnier.  And it's a great example of why this movie is so good, and why it works so well.  Simply put, it's fun.  Edwards has a formula for success that begins with having a good story at the core, an excellent supporting cast to flesh it all out, then mixing it all together with the main ingredient which is, of course, Sellers.  It's one that works, and of which directors of some of the more recent fare being proffered as `comedy' could benefit. 	Christopher Plummer is well cast as debonair master thief Sir Charles Litton, bringing an air of sophistication to the film that contrasts so well with the antics of Sellers.  Characters returning after debuting in `A Shot In The Dark' include the terrific Lom, whose Chief Inspector Dreyfus is the perfect foil for Clouseau; Andre Maranne (Francois); and of course Burt Kwouk as Clouseau's ever-attacking manservant, Cato.  The scenes between Sellers and Kwouk, in which they spar at Clouseau's house, are a riot, as is the way Sellers and Lom play off of one another throughout the film (or the series, for that matter); Lom's `reactions' alone to what Sellers is doing are classic bits of comedy. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Arne (Colonel Sharky), Peter Jeffrey (General Wadafi), Gregoire Aslan (Chief of Lugash Police), Victor Spinetti (Hotel Concierge) and John Bluthal (Blind Beggar).  A number of elements go into making a comedy work, and `The Return Of The Pink Panther' has them all, but most especially, Peter Sellers, who without a doubt is one of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen.  His comedy works because he always plays it straight and allows the humor to flow naturally from the situation at hand; there's never a laugh that is forced or false.  Consider one of the opening scenes in which Clouseau, walking a beat, questions a blind beggar with a monkey about having the proper permits to beg, all while the bank in front of which they are standing is being robbed.  There's a purity about it that makes it a joy to watch; the kind of film you can see over and over again and never get tired of.  One of the great things about video and DVD is that it affords us the opportunity of cuing up this film-- as well as the other `Panther' movies-- at will.  For a lot of laughs, take advantage of the technology at hand and check out Peter Sellers and discover what `classic' comedy is all about.  It never gets old, and somehow just keeps getting better with age.  I rate this one 9/10.

This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012?Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. The Pink Panther is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And A Shot in the Dark is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

In 1964, the character was such a success that Sellers would reprise him in the vastly superior A Shot In The Dark.As a result of two wonderful performances as the inept Frenchman, it feels remarkable that it took another 11 years before Sellers would retake the Mantle of the Inspector. When he did though, Sellers put in yet another fine performance as he wandered aimlessly around, causing trouble in his wake.In The Return of the Pink Panther, the famous diamond has one again been stolen. With a glove marked with a P left at the scene of the crime, Clouseau believes that Sir Charles Litton (David Niven now being replaced by Christopher Plummer) is out of retirement. As Litton travels around the globe to try to clear his name, Clouseau follows with the plan to arrest him.The true beauty of The Return of the Pink Panther is that director Blake Edwards has learnt the true value of both the brand name and Sellers. By combining countless moments of Clouseau chaos with the Pink Panther brand, Edwards manages to create a film which can be watched over and over again without loss of style or humour. The Return of the Pink Panther is one of the finest comedies ever made and whilst Plummer feels inferior compared with Niven, the film never looses it's pace and humour. Sellers is screen gold and with him this series of films is joy to watch.

Previously, Alan Arkin had stepped into his shoes for one movie, apparently with bad results.  In Return, the fabled Pink Panther diamond is again stolen, with the Phantom's calling card monogrammed glove left as a clue.  Clouseau goes back on the case, as does Sir Charles Lytton (Christopher Plummer, taking over for David Niven), the former Phantom himself.  Anyway, this movie shows the progress of the Panther franchise, when the crazy characters and Clouseau's wacky mannerisms start to really show.  Sellers brings slapstick to a fever pitch, making a shambles of everything in his path, not to mention the sanity of his superior, Chief Inspector Dreyfus, played by Herbert Lom.  There are lots of funny scenes, including the one in which Clouseau is distracted from a bank robbery by a blind accordionist and his chimpanzee minkey.  It's definitely one of the better chapters in the Pink Panther saga.

Fast, furious, wacky, and hilarious.In fact, this movie is, in many respects, the movie the first should have been. The plot once again revolves around the Pink Panther diamond. The chief suspect is once again Sir Charles The Phantom Lytton. And, of course, Peter Sellers is once again on the case as the one-of-a-kind Jacques Clouseau.Class act David Niven has been replaced by the equally classy Christopher Plummer (Murder by Decree, The Sound of Music, Dragnet). His portrayal of Sir Charles is more dashing and youthful than Niven's. In this film, his character is also more likable, simply because he's working alongside Clouseau rather than against him.And Inspector Clouseau, the underdog, is now, finally, the hero. He's been demoted to bumbling Parisian street cop by his slightly crooked boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (played hilariously for the second time by Herbert Lom.) Then the president of Lugash specifically requests Clouseau be restated in order to find the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from a museum. The return of the Pink Panther diamond is Clouseau's responsibility.The film is divided between Clouseau's quest to find Sir Charles, whom he blames for the Panther's disappearance, and Sir Charles' quest to find the Panther and by doing so clear his name. Clouseau's adventure is filled with more slapstick than in either of the previous two films, and good slapstick, at that. Peter Sellers plays Clouseau in the way that only he could, with results that are guaranteed to make any comedy fan laugh. Meanwhile, Sir Charles' side of the story is filled with action and international intrigue, in a plot that's absurd and confusing, but to be expected from a Pink Panther film. Graham Stark, who played Clouseau's partner in A Shot in the Dark, now appears as Sir Charles' put-upon underworld informant.All is finally right with the Pink Panther universe. Sir Charles is finally likable. It's okay to empathize towards Clouseau. And there's humor in the romantic cat-and-mouse game between Sir Charles' new bride and Clouseau. Lady Lytton is played by Catherine Schell (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), and is, interestingly enough, not the ex-Mrs. Clouseau, one of the earliest cracks in the series' fragile continuity. However, it's amusing to see Lady Lytton take advantage of Clouseau and those around her, whereas in the first movie it just seemed unfair when Clouseau's wife treated him the same way.

To follow was The Pink Panther Strikes Again and Revenge Of The Pink Panther. I say trilogy because of course 'Revenge' saw Sellers' last outing before his premature death.This film is a refreshing return to the roots of the original with Closeau on the trail of the PP diamond after it is once again stolen by the infamous Phantom.  The Phantom's alter-ego, Sir Charles Webb (Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven), is naturally assusmed to be the culprit but he is in fact innocent and so joins in the search.Steve, from the first page, is spot on with his review of the film.  It is slow and quite dismal when Sellers is not on screen and the sub-plot involving Sir Charles is weak and uninteresting, which was not the case with Niven in the original but nevertheless Plummer is an inspired choice for the role.  Actually, the whole story isn't really clear or upfront, just Sellers at his best.  And when he is on the screen, its gleaming with hilarity with a genius at play.The result is a comedy which has its obvious flaws but also one which has many, many memorable and rip-roaring laughs.

We get the classic minkey sequence and meet Cato, for the first time, in one of the series' great slapstick routines. However the film has a sort of split personality and the current DVD transfer is too grainy for a large-screen TV IMHO. So, rent it, but I'd wait for something better if you're looking to collect.I wouldn't exactly say this movie sets the tone for the rest of the series. The original starred David Niven, with an all-star supporting cast including Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. Then Clouseau became the star of A Shot in the Dark, which didn't involve either the Pink Panther gem nor jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton. This film has them all, so tries to 'balance' the action between Clouseau and Sir Charles. It doesn't work, and probably as a result there were no more such attempts the series becomes all about Clouseau, and that's for the best. I like Christopher Plummer, but the movie is too 'heavy' when he's on screen - probably the writer's fault. As for Catherine Schell, I'd look at her in anything (or nothing at all) and IMHO her acting compares favorably to at least Dyan Cannon's and Elke Sommers'. Herbert Lom, Burt Kwouk, and Andre Maranne are of course a terrific comedic supporting cast, but Peter Arne has to straddle the comedic and serious aspects of the film, which doesn't really work out.The story shifts back and forth between the perspectives of Sir Charles and Clouseau. The Pink Panther gem, nationalized by the government of Lugash after the events of the original film, has been displayed in the national museum until stolen in a great caper sequence. Against the wishes of his frustrated boss (how can an idiot be a police officer), Clouseau, who (sort-of) recovered the gem previously, is recalled from beat duty (There was some question whether it was the man or his minkey who was breaking ze law) and put on the case at the request of Lugash police chief Colonel Sharky. Clouseau naturally suspects Sir Charles, particularly since his trademark, a glove embroidered with the letter P, was left at the scene. Sir Charles, however, is surprised; he has been living in retirement and knows nothing about the matter until it is brought to his attention by his mischievous wife Claudine. Knowing he will be suspected, Litton sets off for Lugash to find the real criminal while Clouseau sets off for Nice to investigate Sir Charles' home - and wife. Clues lead both Clouseau (I am NOT Guy Gadbois) and Sir Charles to a Swiss hotel (and the parrot sequence.) All is revealed in the final confrontation where more than one policeman proves to have been playing a double game.Someone here said it hasn't aged well but I'd say almost the opposite - the first time you see it you'll probably think it hilarious - but it may pall the second time around.

The story is interesting, it isn't as slow as The Pink Panther or as ridiculous as Revenge of the Pink Panther which I did appreciate.The cast and comedy were what elevated this film though. The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered, with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs, Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery, Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy, and the acting is very good, as good as Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom(with his mental breakdown another highlight) and Christopher Plummer are, it is Peter Sellars who steals the show, his Clousseau as always is a riot.Overall, a great comedy and film.

Several of the dialogue exchanges between Sellers and Lom are laugh-out-loud funny, and in addition to a great animated opening titles sequence, there is a fantastic end credits animated sequence in which Lom becomes involved with the animation. The film is not all good news though with an excessive amount of slapstick comedy; the slow motion fight scenes between Clouseau and Cato are particularly grating, and running at nearly two hours long, much of the physical comedy (Sellers getting stuck under a desk) seems needlessly dragged out. Christopher Plummer's casting is also a bit of a mixed blessing. He gives the role his all, but playing Niven's character from the original film, it is hard not to draw unfavourable comparisons. The rest of the cast are very good though, with British comedy legend Victor Spinetti as solid as ever and a zesty turn from Catherine Schell. This is Sellers and Lom's film all the way though, and as suspenseful as the actual jewel theft is early on, it is all the back and forth action between Sellers and Lom that renders the film very decent as far as sequels go.

Although Simone was Sir Charles Litton's mistress and is shown going away to South America with him at the end of The Pink Panther, that does not necessarily mean that she immediately married him and became for all time Lady Litton. Lady Litton as played by Catherine Schell in The Return of the Pink Panther is Claudine, another woman entirely. If anything, it's The Trail of the Pink Panther, the atrocious jumble released after Sellers' death, that strained credibility of continuity here by bringing back Capucine as Simone and having her say that *she* was married to Sir Charles for the many years after the original Pink Panther. Of course, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that Sir Charles married her, then divorced her to marry Claudine, then divorced Claudine to remarry Simone.David Niven was unavailable to reprise Sir Charles, which is why Christopher Plummer was cast in the role in Return of the Pink Panther.

The last 'Clouseau' movie had been the ill-fated Alan Arkin version from 1968. It was not any old Clouseau audiences wanted, but Sellers. Both men agreed to put aside their creative differences and restore the original.'Return' begins in Lugash where the fabulous 'Pink Panther' diamond is stolen once more. The only clue is a white glove found at the scene of the crime, embroidered with the letter 'P'. The authorities call on the man who recovered it last time - Clouseau. The passing years have not been kind to our hero - he is pounding the beat as a gendarme. During an argument with a street musician ( John Bluthal ), Clouseau fails to notice a bank robbery is in progress behind his back. Worse, he helps the robbers get away.Chief Comissioner Dreyfus ( Herbert Lom ) is only too happy for Clouseau to go back to Lugash. It would appear that Sir Charles Lytton ( Christopher Plummer ) is up to his old tricks again. Now retired from crime and living in the South of France with his wife Claudine ( Catherine Schell ), he is concerned that someone is imitating him and decides to track down the real culprit...Forget the plot. It is nothing more than an excuse on which to peg the gags, and many are first rate. There are more laughs to be found here than in the original 'Pink Panther' ( which had too much of David Niven for my liking ) and the Arkin 'Clouseau'. I think I'm right in saying this film was the beginning of Clouseau's habit of mangling the French language. Not only do English people not understand him, but other French people do not either. When he asks Victor Spinetti's hotel clerk for a room, the man thinks he is asking for a 'rheum'.In addition to Sellers returning, we also get back Herbert Lom as the harassed 'Dreyfus', whose hatred of the detective is so great he keeps trying to kill him, and Burt Kwouk as 'Cato', the Chinese manservant who is under orders to attack his boss every chance he gets. 'Return' has one of the best Clouseau vs.Cato scenes, ending with the former trying to do a flying kung-fu leap and crashing through a door into his kitchen. Christopher Plummer replaces Niven as 'Sir Charles Lytton'. When we last saw him, he was with Clouseau's wife ( Capucine ). Catherine Schell's character is not the same woman. It would not be until 1981's 'Trail Of The Pink Panther' that the former 'Mrs.Clouseau' would be seen again. Graham Stark is back also, but as seedy crook 'Pepe', who keeps getting his fingers crushed.'Return' was a big success, paving the way for further sequels. It is not included on the box set though, due to it having been made by a different company. It has since been released separately.Funniest moment? For me its the bit where Clouseau enters the hotel, and a man requests politely he hand over his hat, coat and gloves. Thinking him to be a member of staff, the Inspector does this, and then watches dumbfounded as the man casually walks out of the foyer, gets into a car, waves, and drives off!

By this, the third film in the franchise, director Blake Edwards knew exactly what his audience wanted, a roller-coaster of anarchy revolving around Peter Sellers and he delivers it in spades.Consider for example Clouseau's initial brawl with Kato (He used to do a bit of cooking but now he's taken to attacking me at any opportunity) or his bumbling attempts to investigate Lady Litton's hotel room, or the madcap closing battle in a Japanese restaurant, every moment Sellers is on screen is a joy to behold. His good natured but ludicrously stupid antics are classic slapstick at its very best and thankfully, unlike the original in the series, most of the film centres on him.In fact the only factor preventing this movie from being the non-stop tour de force of riotous laughs its successors were, is the re-appearance of Charles Litton and the introduction of his wife, Lady Litton. Now played by Christopher Plummer, Litton is supposed to be considered dashing, debonair and sophisticated in his role, but unfortunately he and his wife instead come across as a pair of insufferably smug gits afflicted with severe superiority disorders. Thankfully, they are afforded nowhere near as much screen time as Clouseau is, but it wasn't until the following film where Litton was written out entirely that it became perfect.Nevertheless, this is still a hysterically funny film, though I'd recommend checking out both of its successors before watching this one.

Written, directed and produced by Blake Edwards this 1975 film in The Pink Panther series is breath taking funny and stands as one I will always remember.Inspector Clouseau fake exaggerated French accent is more pronounced in this movie, The Return of the Pink Panther than the previous and Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus mishaps were funnier than expected, that i found myself looking forward to his next unfortunate mishap. The chief instrument of his (other than the existence of Clouseasu) was his inability to tell which he was holding a gun or a lighter.The film stars Peter Sellers who reprises his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The Return of the Pink Panther also stars the 84th Academy Award (2012) winner for best supporting actor (who became the oldest actor to win the award at age 82) Christopher Plummer who replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton (the notorious Phantom).In this flick the Pink Panther diamond is now back in focus as it gets stolen again, and the man who was part responsible for finding it when it got stolen the first time, was called back to help recover the stolen diamond.The movie plot is funny to the core, with screenplays that will make you hold your ribs from bursting free. The late Blake Edwards (died in 2010) is known primarily for his comedies and this movie shows us why. The plot began in the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief breaks into the National Museum, avoiding all the security pitfalls that were set in place for any prospective thief and steals the Pink Panther diamond. The mysterious thief left behind a calling card, which was a white monogrammed glove with a gold-tinted P on it.Feeling outwitted by the thief who was able to get pass the elaborated security system, put in place to secure the diamond, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) to help them as they try to recover their national treasure.Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him.This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"Funny If Uneven","Date":"24 January 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Ironically, the best part of the movie isn't any of the comic scenes, but the part at the beginning depicting the elaborate way the thief gets past all the traps to steal the Pink Panther jewel.

In A Shot In The Dark, Clouseau's repeated gaffes serve to ultimately drive Commissioner Dreyfus crazy; in this movie, most of them seem to just serve as filler entertainment, such as the part where he is disguised as a hotel room cleaner and has everything go wrong when he tries to do that job.The movie's other major problem is that Christopher Plummer was a poor substitute for David Niven as the Phantom. Niven was suave and cool; Plummer was a thuggish brute who resorted to breaking bones-rather unlike how a suave cat burglar is supposed to behave.This could have been a much better movie than it was.

Though terribly plotted, The Return of the Pink Panther is filled with enough genuine hilarity that you won't really mind.The story is almost too simple. The legendary Pink Panther diamond is stolen from its home in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash, with evidence left behind implicating the almost-as-legendary jewel thief The Phantom. The man who retrieved the diamond the first time it was stolen by The Phantom, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), is called into action, much to the chagrin of his dementedly frustrated boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). But it turns out that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the man who was The Phantom before retiring to please his young wife Claudine (Catherine Schell), is not responsible for the theft. Litton decides to head to Lugash to get to the bottom of the mystery while Clouseau is left to follow the Lady Litton to Switzerland as part of his own investigation.These Pink Panther movies are easy to review. Peter Sellers gives one of the greatest slapstick performances in cinema history as Clouseau, but there's not much else here. This one is essentially split in two, with Christopher Plummer doing a fairly good impersonation of Roger Moore, if James Bond were an international jewel thief, and Sellers just left to his own devices as Catherine Schell does little more than laugh at Clouseau's antics. Things are spiced up a bit with Herbert Lom's twitchy portrayal of Dreyfus' decent into madness over the colossal incompetence of his subordinate.I haven't the slightest idea why Blake Edwards thought anyone cared about Sir Charles Litton as much as Clouseau and while Edwards has his virtues as a storyteller, a sharp sense of pacing isn't one of them. This movie has a bloated and slack feel to it. Sellers is also noticeably less spry in the mid 70s than he was in the mid 60s.None of it matters all that much, because The Return of the Pink Panther has more than enough laughs, particularly Clouseau's battles with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and an epic struggle of Man vs. Lamp. This is a funny, family-friendly movie you should definitely watch with your kids when they're little.

This may be because it is a thief movie which the follow on Pink Panther movies are not.This makes it more enjoyable to me since it is not one attempt after another at slapstick but rather, has a feel similar to The Thief Who Came to Dinner or Topkapi. Henry Mancini's music, as when used in the former, gives the tension feel to the serious scenes. But tension has not much of a place in a comedy.Afterwards, the latter movies went to pure comedy, which is okay, but I hardly ever watch them. This is the movie that I return to time after time. Which may be what the point is, if not the crucial error in the series.This movie and the first movie do concern the title in that it is the diamond The Pink Panther which is the focal prop at the very least.

Plummer, in replacing David Niven as Sir Charles, gives a solid performance and RPA is a worthy contribution to the series. Like A Shot in the Dark, it successfully establish the series' later directions - focusing on Clouseau and his relationships with Dreyfus and Cato (Burt Kwouk).The plot takes only a few of twists and turns, and the writing team somewhat uncharacteristically takes the mystery which drives it fairly seriously - depicting Clouseau's ineptitude more clearly than in previous efforts. Edwards' directing balances the plot's complexities and Sellers and Lom's brilliant comedic performances well.Recommended, but only after seeing A Shot in the Dark and The Pink Panther.

The Return of the Pink Panther certain had plenty of potential and could have been the best Pink Panther movie. However, this film has a certain sense of cruel humor that brings down the overall quality just slightly. For example, Christopher Plummer's rather mean character, always breaking the fingers of his assistant, as well as Chief Dreyfuss actually choking a man to death, come off as unappealing and make the film a bit less funny. Nevertheless, Closeau is hysterical in this film, from his first scene in which he tries to talk with a blind man and his monkey; hilarious. This is also the second Panther film with Closeau's assistant Cato, a Martial-arts fighter who tests Closeau by hiding in his apartment and attacking him. From Cato's first scene to the last one, the brilliant twist in the restaurant, he provides possible the most hysterical aspect of the film. This is a must-see for fans of this series and great comedy alike. Though the next film (Pink Panther Strikes Again) works a bit better and provides more laughs overall, this is very worthwhile.

All signs point to the theft being the work of the supposedly retired jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton (Christopher Plummer). Clouseau, as the fellow who found the diamond the last time, is requested to take up the case. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), can't imagine his most incompetent man getting such a vital assignment. Lugash and France have been allies for nearly 200 years, he protests, but it's no use when dealing with the twisted karma that is Clouseau.I feel indebted to Return Of The Pink Panther. Not only did it recharge Sellers' career enough to allow him to give one of the greatest performances of all time four years later in Being There, it also directly led to the making of my favorite film, Clouseau's next adventure The Pink Panther Strikes Again. This film does have some glaring holes, but what's good outweighs what's bad.At the heart of what's good here is Sellers, who aside from the odd project here and there like The Party and The Optimists was coming off a ten-year drought when he made this film with director Blake Edwards. Edwards and Sellers had a famous dislike-hate relationship. But Edwards needed a hit, too, so he and Sellers had no choice but to work through their differences and find the chemistry only they together could create.So we get more classic Clouseau craziness, only amped-up. When Clouseau walks into his apartment after a hard day's work, we are expected to be on the lookout for his attacking Chinese manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk), the question is where will he strike? If Clouseau is investigating the scene of the theft, you know he's going to make a mess of things, just not how until it finally happens.In Return we get to meet Clouseau's wildest alter-ego, the swinging playboy Guy Gadbois, who loses half his mustache sidling up to Lytton's wife, Lady Lytton (Catherine Schell), in a Gstaad discothèque. That doesn't stop him from delivering some of the lamest come-on material the 1970s ever saw short of What's your sign? Clouseau also destroys several hotel rooms, drives a car into the same pool twice, and loses his pants while pretending to be a telephone repairman. I'm putting my tools away! he yells through a closed door as he pulls his pants back on. He also sucks a parrot into a vacuum cleaner, though birdlovers will be pleased to know the parrot lives another day to poop on Clouseau.Yes, the Pink Panther movies got progressively dumber as they went on, but here at least, and with the next film, too, you get a kind of magic stupidity of the Homer Simpson variety. When Clouseau asks a taxi driver to follow that car, the driver naturally hops out of his cab to run after it on foot. When Clouseau is targeted for assassination, the would-be killer appears at Clouseau's door with a bomb that looks straight out of Spy Vs. Spy. Clouseau accepts this like a Fed Ex package, ironically while counseling Cato on the necessity of alertness.The weakness of the film is the Lytton subplot, not major, just annoying. Plummy Plummer is about as lost as you'd expect in a comedy, and Edwards works him into a To Catch A Thief subplot that never gels either as suspense or comedy. Plummer does have some pleasant opening scenes with Schell, showcasing Edwards' gift for delivering charm in place of laughs, but lightweight Schell is out of her element with Sellers, and her annoying, patronizing giggles get in the way. There's also a long opening theft sequence that could have been drastically shortened, or eliminated entirely, to the benefit of the rest of the film. As it is, it's more than 15 minutes before we even get to see Clouseau.But when you get Clouseau, you really get him, and Return is a showcase for all that made Clouseau and Sellers great. It's not a deep performance, or even that inspired or clever, but it's consistently winning in its funny, silly way, and closer to the highs than the lows of Sellers' brilliantly inconsistent career.

It is the funniest of the Pink Panther films by far. The original Pink Panther flick, starring David Niven, was a dud, but this film got the formula precisely right. Sellers as the bumbling Clousseau was right on target, and Kato was never funnier. Herbert Lom, as Chief Inspector Dreyfuss, has never received the acclaim he deserved for his performance as the man driven insane by Clousseau's antics. And, alone among the PP films, this one has a fair plot, involving the Lord and Lady Litton. Catherine Schell, as Lady Litton, is hysterical, as she is unable to restrain her genuine laughter at many of Sellers's greatest comic moments.

For one thing, there is no Pink Panther jewel stolen in it! My money goes to The Return of the Pink Panther as the first great Pink Panther film.For starters, the casting is so much better than the first film. Instead of David Niven, Christopher Plummer plays The Phantom and does a much better job to boot.Another plus is that the story focuses,rightly,on Clouseau and his fumbling of the investigation, rather on Sir Charles Litton (The Phantom). We want to see more of the dumb klutz detective rather than the jewel thief. The director/producer/co-writer Blake Edwards, focuses much more on slapstick than he did on the previous two films and the result is a much funnier film. Also, Edwards was wise to allow Peter Sellers to do what he does best; improvise. You can see the joy come through on screen.Edwards wisely imports many of the supporting characters such as Chief Inspector Dreyfus and Cato from A Shot in the Dark and gives them many funny setups for Clouseau's pratfalls.As with all of Edwards' films, this is best seen in the widescreen version, which is crucial to Edwards' perfectly timed sight gags. The pan-and-scan version will take away from the timing and you won't get the humor as fast as you would with a letterboxed version.Unfortunately, The Return of the Pink Panther was not included with the MGM  letterbox set released a few years ago, because it was not released by United Artists. So it is currently out in a pan-and-scan version by Artisan. Sometimes, it appears on AMC letterboxed. Next time, set your VCRs and tape it. You'll thank me later.**** out of 4 stars "},{"Title":"do you have a rooooooom?","Date":"5 December 2005","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" this entry in the series is better than the 1964 original mostly because there is more Peter Sellers.he steals every scene he is in, and when not on camera the film slows down measurably.fortunately that is not for very long.as far as the rest of the cast goes,Christopher Plummer does what he can with what amounts to a thankless role.same for Catherine Schell(who can't seem to control her laughter impulses).a bright spot is Herbert Lom as the put-upon boss who almost stays up with Sellers.with all the behind the scenes action between actor and director it's a wonder these movies were completed in the first place.My personal favorite is The Pink Panther Strikes Again! which is even funnier. guten tag,wie gehts!

Sellers, in the sequels to the Shot in the Dark movie really camped up Clouseau, especially the fractured French accent which even the other characters cannot fathom. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Sellers and Clouseau doing physical, farcical, and dialog comedy. Also hilarious is Herbert Lom's portrayal of Dreyfous, Clouseau's boss, who is eventually driven literally mad by Clouseau as the Panther movies progress. This movie is superior to the later sequels and even if you are not a Sellers fan worth seeing.

Nothing else. He's mostly celebrated as the creator of the Pink Panther series. But this one's problem is how it drags. There isn't any anticipation felt or even created, any comic anguish, that nearly Hitchcockian suspense where time suddenly dilates to allow a burst of laughter.Other than the usual homage to the silent cinema of Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Leo McCarey, the Clouseau films seem to reveal preoccupations that come up again and again in Edwards' work. Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure.An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau.The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.

It is also in this movie that Sellers and Blake Edwars exploit the full use of the Laurel and Hardy mayhem which works to good effect. The movie does have its problems.

The performance of Christopher Plumber is rather boring too, one wishes that it was Davis Niven reprising his role as The Phantom and not Plumber.

In fact, if you look, everyone is cracking a grin in this film because Peter Sellers is a GAS! His disguises are far and away his best than in any of the films and the gags are still fresh (in future films some would become, unfortunately, overused and stale). This is the film that started the ball rolling for the 70s sequels to the ultra successful 60s achievements The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, the latter of which defined the archetypal Clouseau image. Years after A Shot In The Dark came this marvelous return to form, which I believe was never paralleled. Face it; after Return of the Pink Panther things just got WEIRD. Dreyfuss got pushed way over the edge; tacky, phony sci-fi elements were introduced; and then along came Dyan Cannon, the surefire Kiss of Death. In Return we have lots of great comedy with a certain restraint that keeps things believably eccentric, but never so over the top that you're shaking your head at the impossibility of any of it. No tacky sci-fi gags, etc. Later efforts became (by necessity) too broad and unbelievable, and at least in this feature there is a foothold on reality against which Clouseau's antics can be gauged; and absurdity is only truly funny when it is still held within a frame of believability. This film does it, beautifully, and the films to follow only have intermittently funny set pieces. The cast in this film is marvellous all-round, all very much normal against which Clouseau's ineptitude and silliness plays magnificently. The hotel room farce is among the best and most memorable of any comedy film I can recall (that poor masseuse!). Pure and true farce played well and with impeccible timing by all involved. And it is in this film we have the privilege of seeing Chief Inspector Dreyfuss slowly driven mad by Clouseau (again, films after this could only take Dreyfuss's madness for granted -- not nearly as funny). I'll never forget going to see this film in a theater with my mom and the both of us practically wetting our pants it was so funny. Return of the Pink Panther wears well, and is probably on my list of most favored films. I can watch Peter Sellers breaking door bells, repairing phernes, driving his truck into swimming pools, and acting the bon vivant as his ridiculous playboy character Guy over any of the later efforts! ;-) Watching this film over again is like visiting an old friend. Buy it for your collection, or at least rent it once in a while. It's good natured fun, and the best of the (later) Clouseaus.

I'm at a bit of a disadvantage in trying to review this movie, because I've never seen the original Pink Panther (or any of the other Pink Panther movies to be honest) and so have nothing to compare this to but can still say that it's quite funny in places. Clouseau is probably Peter Sellers' most famous character, and he plays the role effortlessly. The story - revolving around the theft of the diamond - isn't particularly engrossing, but in this kind of movie the story is secondary anyway. It's Sellers, and Clouseau's dealings with those around him - in particular Chief Inspector Dreyfus, who is eventually driven completely insane by the bumbling Clouseau, and who is played brilliantly by Herbert Lom - that make the movie. Sellers engages in physical comedy, offers some wonderful slapstick humour and, of course, his fake French accent and disguises are worthy of chuckles all the way through. Donald Sutherland as Charles Litton and Catherine Schell as Lady Charlene Litton offer good supporting performances. Schell herself seemed to be laughing all the way through at Sellers' performance. I don't know if that was intended or if she really had trouble not giggling at Seller's performance and director Blake Edwards simply chose to leave her responses to Sellers in the movie. (The latter seems most likely.) The repeated appearances by Clouseau's valet (if that's what he was supposed to be) Cato (Burt Kwouk) became a bit tiresome after a while.Some have told me that this is the funniest of the Pink Panther movies. If so, that's a bit disappointing in all honesty, because I didn't find this to be anywhere near the funniest movie I've ever seen. It had me smiling throughout and chuckling a few times but never really outright laughing, but still the generally sustained funniness makes this a fun movie to watch.

Also returning were Herbert Lom (now Chief Inspector Dreyfus), Andre Maranne (Francois), Burt Kwouk (Cato), and Graham Stark in a different role as snitch Pepi. And Frank Waldman, who previously co-wrote with brother Tom the non-Sellers-Edwards movie Inspector Clouseau, was Edwards' writing partner for this and the next series entry. And once again, Henry Mancini provides the score which returns the Pink Panther theme to the animated opening credits. Joining them were Christopher Plummer as Sir Charles Litton (replacing David Niven) and Catherine Schell as Lady Claudine Litton. With an 11-year gap between A Shot in the Dark and this, both Edwards and Sellers seemed to only improve in their collaboration of mining their talents in getting the surefire gags milked for all they're worth. And Lom, especially, is a hoot as the superior of Clouseau who gets more mentally mad every time he fails to kill him. While admittedly, Ms. Schell is a little distracting whenever she noticeably laughs at Sellers' antics, she's also at her most charming during these scenes and besides, her beautiful face makes those scenes worth it. And the way Cato surprises Clouseau are quite hilarious especially when Edwards uses slow motion. If anything slows the film down, it's the Charles Litton sequences which are the more dramatic parts of the picture. Still, even those scenes provide some humor whenever Stark as Pepi has his fingers constantly hurt by either Charles or someone else. And for the first time, The Pink Panther and The Inspector are teamed in the beginning animated credit sequence to humorous effect with Pink imitating some movie stars while The Inspector chases him. That sequence, by the way, is by Richard Williams Studio with help from Chuck Jones' animator Ken Harris. So on that note, I highly recommend The Return of the Pink Panther. P.S.
