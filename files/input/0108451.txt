Every once in a while, I just want to find a movie that allows me to let go and just cry. This is definitely one for the records. The chemistry between Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei is so strong that you just can't help but believe these two people actually care about one-another. Marisa Tomei as Caroline,  a waitress that seems to work all hours of the night and Christian Slater as Adam, her quiet, secret admirer dishwasher with a heart problem. Throw in Rosie Perez as Caroline's smart-ass best friend and what more could you ask for? These characters have such depth that, even though the plot is a bit predictable, you feel so much for them and by the end, you will be reduced to tears. I still tear up every time I see this movie. The perfect film for any sap with a taste for sentiment. It will always have a special place in my heart. A romance to go down in movie history. 9/10!

Although she has had her heart broken numerous times, she has not become cynical about love.  Adam (Christian Slater) is a busboy at the same restaurant as Caroline; he is, however, a shy recluse who doesn't relate to people very well. Yet, when a crisis occurs, it is Adam who comes to Caroline's rescue.  For the first time, she sees him in a different light and they begin a loving relationship.  Caroline is finally experiencing the happiness she deserves and Adam is opening his life to someone else.  Still, something from Adam's past comes forward to haunt them.  Will they find a happy ending?This is an extremely touching and humorous love story about working-class people.  The movie has many candid scenes about restaurant life and the people who work there.  Also, Tomei gives a sweet, irresistible performance that warms the heart.  Although one may need a kleenex or two before the film is over, its loving atmosphere will remain with the viewer for a long time.  Recommended for everyone searching for a film to provide a feel-good-about-life day at the movies.

I agreed to go based on the fact that one of my favorite actresses appeared in it, Marisa Tomei. The most I'd seen of Christian Slater was in 'Robin Hood', and didn't care much for him in that.What a change one movie can make for opinions on an actor.I was engaged with this movie from frame one.Cliff Eidelman's score is captivating and very moving in this movie, flowing along effortlessly with the film. Marisa Tomei is pure magic, and Rosie Perez is just right as the screechy best friend.What surprised me most was Slater's performance. Here, he gives a very introspective and introverted performance, that, in my opinion, was worthy of an Oscar nod. The mannerisms with which he portrays Adam as the shy orphan who seems unsure of himself are dealt with great detail and care. He hasn't had a better performance before or since.That doesn't overshadow Tomei's performance in this film. She is simply beautiful, no matter what part she is portraying. She has the Minnesotan accent down pat, and you believe you are in the Twin Cities while watching the film. I feel her performance in this movie was a step above My Cousin Vinny. Too bad the Academy didn't agree.And when Slater and Tomei occupy the frame together, it is, for a lack of a better term, absolute glory. The chemistry between these two actors on screen is so thick you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.The cinematography, by Jost Vacano, who also did movies like Das Boot and Robocop, while not visually stunning, is very technical, with the use of pull-pans/push-pans and ground perspective shots. A very well-done film all the way around, from Bill's directing to Mia Goldman's seamless editing. Too bad some wiseacre reviewer gave the ending away in a review of the film before release and literally killed it's box office.I own the DVD now, and I can offer one warning Gentlemen, if you watch this movie with your wife/significant other, be prepared to offer up excuses like 'there is something in my eye', or 'it must be my allergies', if you're not comfortable admitting letting the waterworks go. The proclamations of affection between these two are so charming, yet not heavy handed. It's the kind of things you would have wish you'd said to that 'one that got away'.My rating 9 (no movie has ever gotten a 10 from me, but this one almost had me reconsidering) "},{"Title":"Untamed Heart..

It is a sad, sweet movie without the usual gloss and pretension that ruin so many filmed love stories. These are working class people living working class lives. Tomei is touching as a woman who has been hurt once too often but who still holds out hope. Slater gives one of his best performances as the virtually mute busboy with both social and health problems. A heart-tugging vignette at the very beginning, involving the busboy as child in a Catholic orphanage, foreshadows later events in the film. Slater underplays beautifully, and thankfully so as this is Tomei's film all the way. She never looked more beautiful than she does here. Watch for the Christmas morning scene. Tomei wakes up to a special magic thanks to her busboy pal, and magnificently conveys her sense of wonder. Beware, however UNTAMED HEART (BOY WITH A BABOON HEART would have been a better title) is a two-box of Kleenex.

Our expectations are constantly being upgraded and shifted to new levels of anticipation.  I really did not expect 'Untamed Heart' to have quite the same impact today, as it did when I first saw it.  I was wrong. I still cried. It's still the most heart warming, feel good, romantic comedy I've ever seen.For those who are not familiar with the story, Christian Slater plays the part of the mysterious Adam who works as a busboy in a diner.  All his life he's never physically come into contact with people, and he never speaks. You could say he lives in his own magic kingdom, hermetically sealed from the outside world-so much so that at the age of 26, he still believes in a fairy tale the nuns told him when he was growing up in an orphanage, involving magic rubies trickling down from a magic mountain, and being given a 'baboon heart.' Later, he even admits to possessing 'magic' records that he plays 'whenever the world doesn't agree with him.'In real life it would be hard not to raise a smile at such an account, or at the very least be convinced the person was in need of some serious medication, but it's a testament to the power of the story that like Caroline(portrayed by the Marisa Tomei) rather then dismiss him, we start accepting his childlike understanding of the world. We overlook it when at the start of the film, Caroline asks him questions and he doesn't even respond.  Anybody else would consider that plain rude. We forgive him when he creeps into Caroline's bedroom to watch her sleeping.  We understand when he follows her home repeatedly, keeping at a safe distance to remain undetected. The reason we're able to make such adjustments, is that normal rules here do not apply, because in the world that he lives in, it's not inhabited by mere humans.  He still occupies that fantastic world that we so readily discarded as children, because we had to embrace the darker reality of adulthood in order to cope with our new responsibilities.  So Adam's character, while undoubtedly naive, offers no real threat. As an audience, we know where he's coming from. He's simply trying to make sense of the world around him, and does not understand how to behave any different.Gradually, over the course of the film Caroline brings out more and more from Adam, and because of his unique perspective and vantage point, some of the things he says and does to convince Caroline of his love for her remain long after the credits roll.If we've ever had our heart broken and as a result we try to 'tame' our heart so we don't get hurt again, this is the film we should watch, because it reminds us what love is, and what love can be. Any hurt that we may have felt is nothing compared to the joy we feel when we do get it right.

This young man grew up in the footsteps of what would later become the backyard of what is today's Soprano's environment. Writer Tom Sierchio searched deep into his childhood experiences, thoughts and background to come up with this heartfelt story of a young man with a heart of wonderment. Mr. Serchio helped the viewers understand the various levels of intelligences and the heart which embodies this movie. Mr. Serchio developed a very humble and sincere plot to develop the character of this young man named Adam portrayed by Christian Slater. Mr Slater was outstanding in bringing us the essence of this young man's heart and soul. In addition to the excellent acting of Mr. Slater, we have a young Marisa Tomei stealing our hearts by opening up her soul to this young Adam's purity. The movie is a piece of history and should be cherished by all those who remember the days.Hats off to Mr. Serchio and the entire crew! "},{"Title":"i cried!!!!!

Just after 15 years I got to watch this seemingly heart-touching movie. 'Untamed Heart' is not like a normal love story, its just a story between innocent Adam (Slater) and an unlucky waitress Caroline (Marisa). Adam wishes to live a normal life and use his heart as usual people. But he knows that he has a cardiac problem (considering his heart is of 'baboon'), which made him to stay far away from the people around him. The people hardly care him for his unusual behaviors and characteristics, and all these make Adam to live a lonely life. He works in the same restaurant where Caroline does a routine job as a waitress. But his duty is washing dishes and throwing the garbages from the kitchen. He secretly admires Caroline but doesn't dare to express it. Once late at a night when Caroline was attempted to be raped by two strangers, he got a chance to save her life. This made increase their chemistry of love for one another. Surprisingly, he loves Caroline only with his mind and soul, and not with his heart.Excellent job from Slater, which I never expected from him before watching this over-the-top and sorrowful love story. Earlier to this I just considered him to be an actor born for the generation of action and fighting. He really surprised me after watching this.And I had nothing to say about Marisa as I knew well she is perfectly suited for a better role. Whatever I will mention here will be incomplete about her. She is always awesome. So better to leave it aside.I can imagine how awful it would have been if I had the same conditions as Adam has in this movie.

It's silly, I'm not into the over romantic type of movies, but actually I have to admit that this was a good one. Untamed Heart gets under your skin and if you open yourself up to it, I'm sure you'll find yourself falling for it as well.Caroline doesn't have the happiest love life. Every boyfriend of her's dumps her and mistreats her; she's just a simple waitress who doesn't finish much of what she starts.

Slowly Caroline and Adam develop a strong love for each other, but Caroline learns a strange secret that Adam was a weak baby and was given the heart of a baboon. When he is attacked by the men who tried to rape Caroline, the doctors warn her that he is in danger of his heart, but all Adam wants is to have his heart full of love from Caroline.Untamed Heart is pretty much flawless, I'm sure that you'll enjoy it. It's very sweet and a loving film that anyone could get into. Even I got into it, which once again I say is weird, you're reading a comment from the only girl on Earth who hated The Notebook.

He rarely speaks and keeps to himself. Marisa Tomei is a waitress in said diner, and Rosie Perez is her earthy but sympathetic sidekick. Slater has developed a crush on Tomei and follows her around at a discreet distance, so when she's attacked while walking home from work he's able to rescue her. Later, her attackers wreak an unpleasant revenge on Slater. All of this brings the two of them together. Slater lets her know, in his recedent way, that he adores her, and she responds by falling for this shy, silent kinda guy. Their love is, how you say, consummated. But there is a problem. Slater was told by the nuns at his orphanage that he's had a heart transplant, with the donor being a baboon. Whether that's the case or not, his heart is now weakened and needs a booster shot, which Slater is unready to undergo. Eventually his heart, simian or hominid, beats its last, but not before he's had a heck of a good time exchanging tender gestures and body fluids with Marisa Tomei.I can't really tell if this is a particularly well-done example of the genre because I watch so few examples. I could see most of the developments coming, and so would you. And the crooning of Johnny Mathis and Nat King Cole's mystical pop song, Nature Boy, from the 1950s really wasn't necessary. We get the picture. Slater is quiet, shy, and mysterious -- like Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun -- the sort of man who attracts women, but only in the movies. In real life I would imagine that he would absorb the attention of women who were chiefly neurotics. A research plan for young men who DON'T look like Montgomery Clift Get a menial job, speak to no one, don't meet anyone's gaze, and see what happens. If you save a co-worker from rape, you might get a Thank You note and a box of chocolates.Well, I've made sufficient fun of the movie and it's a bit unfair, like stretching the iridescent wings of a butterfly on the rack. It's supposed to be a sweet and endearing story, and it is, even if it's some mutant form of Beauty and the Beast. At least I was able to get into it, though I hadn't expected to.The Nature Boy business was an irritant, and the baboon heart slipped motionlessly by me, but Slater is quietly effective in the role and Marisa Tomei is quite good and thoroughly believable as a sensitive young woman who serves ham and eggs and reads Catch 22 at home. Rosie Perez is always a kick in the pants too.The film stands as a beacon of hope for those of us who trudge off to work, looking exactly the way we feel, and yet suffer from an intense desire to find love in an unpromising milieu. Or anywhere else.

When he finds out how much she loves Christmas he gets into her house and puts a Christmas tree in her bedroom, in normal circumstances this could be considered to be a bit creepy but Christian as Adam is so vulnerable and innocent it does not seem like this. Adam has a dog but he does not know what the dog is called as apparently the dog never told him. Along with Adam's collection of records and his obsession of ice cream he comes across as a character that just needs to be loved. The ending is really sad why did he have to die. Christian Slater seems to get killed of in a lot of his films, I don't know why as he is such a good actor.

The story line wasn't rushed, the characters knew there parts and they flowed. It made me want to cry and laugh all at the same time through the whole movie. Adams innocence was so endearing, and Carolines world knowledge proved to make them the perfect couple. when someone like Caroline exists it is better that they meet someone like Adam who is pure and has no bad intentions what so ever. I had never seen a movie I liked better than Untamed Heart and I don't think I ever will. I wish to see more movies with Christian Slater seeing as I have only seen two. And I hope that everyone loves this movie because it deserves all the praise it can get. It's a must see. Go out and rent it.  "},{"Title":"Here we are a lovely bunch of coconuts... (spoilers)","Date":"25 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Swell romantic comedy with some fine young stars of the day Christian Slater, Marisa Tomei, and Rosie Perez, in a pretty sad, but nonetheless beautiful little romantic drama.Christian Slater plays Adam, a once-orphaned boy with a heart problem. Actually, he was a kid with a baboon heart, from a transplant (no joking). Unfortunately, despite the transplant, he still has difficulties with his health. He plays the guardian angel of the shadows for his coworker, Caroline (Tomei), who becomes so smitten with her self-appointed protectorate, that they fall in love and carry on quite a perfect relationship.Both of the characters, exhibiting little, if any reason to dislike them (except for maybe Tomei's excessive dreaminess at times and Slater's excessive quietness and avoidance of even mild confrontation). They're both sweet characters that you root for, the one's you hope things will work out, and that they really will live happily ever after. It is a story about a sinecerely romantic guy and a loving woman who oddly, doesn't find Adam's surveillance of Caroline to be creepy (he's been her guardian angel for longer than she knows). It's a sweet tearjeaker, and one that the cast was just swell in.

Yet knowing we are being manipulated, and knowing where the plot is heading, we watch it and weep, even if that was not our intention at the sit-down. Perhaps through this film we re-experience love's first blush; or recall a longing for what might have been, sometime, somewhere, in our own lives. It can be a touching film, if we haven't become too jaded; and cloying if we have. A bonus is getting to hear Nat King Cole singing in that velvet voice of his. It sets a complimentary tone to the plot, when used.Christian Slater is impressive as usual, only breaking character during the hockey scenes when he gets so totally into it that the cool guy self slips past the restrained character facade. He uses his eyes to great effect in this film, far more than in any other, and he pulls off some unlikely lines with such conviction. (Note that Nature Boy underscores these moments) Tomei's eyes are too dark to be really expressive and it makes some think she is a lesser actress than she really is. Her role in this film is as a mixture of bony comfort giver and heart-on-her-sleeve lost girl who wants love so desperately that she always ends up getting hurt.Adam, Slater's character, has a heart condition and believes a fantastic story about a Silverback Baboon King and a jungle adventurer, and it shapes his personality profoundly. Only he can get away with stealing her picture, following her home, and sneaking into her room at night, without coming across as a creepy stalker. His motives are pure and even heroic. In fact, the man with the baboon heart, and the heart bruised girl, unwanted by anyone else, but each other, reminds us that there is someone for everyone, no matter what station in life we tread. Nature Boy, sung by Nat King Cole, and played over the closing credits is hauntingly beautiful, as always. I could listen to him forever.

She's a beautiful and likable young woman but, for some reason, is unable to maintain the romantic interest of the guys she dates. The answer to her love problems turns out to be right under her nose in the form of the diner's quiet dishwasher/janitor, Adam (Christian Slater).Untamed Heart is a must for fans of Marisa Tomei (see the film and you'll see why) and the romance between Caroline and Adam works, although their sexual union is premature IMHO, but real-time has to be condensed into a 102-minute film so I guess it can be overlooked.What struck me most about this film, aside from Marisa, was the character of Adam. He's an outcast; he doesn't fit with the crowd; he's quiet and mysterious in a misfit type of way; he's an easy target for people to mock; he's content to adore Caroline from a distance; his love for her doesn't change as she keeps making mistakes trying to find someone to love; he secretly acts as her guardian angel and doesn't care about getting credit.Why is Caroline attracted to such a person? Because opposites attract. We're naturally attracted to people that have what we lack and vice versa. Caroline is open, talkative and comfortable with practically any social setting; Adam isn't. Adam is aloof, meditative and unconcerned about fitting in -- qualities Caroline lacks.You'll see people like Adam in real life if you open your eyes. At a local restaurant I sometimes catch a glimpse of one of the kitchen workers, whether taking a smoke break outside or whatever. He's in his mid-30s, maybe older, obviously intelligent with a striking appearance, but he's quiet and aloof from the people around him, with an air of mystery. This is a person, like Adam in the film, who doesn't fit into society's mold -- college doesn't work for him despite his intelligence, nor does a conventional job; he just does what he has to to live.The film is very successful at bringing to life this type of outcast in the character of Adam. I found it quite moving. I understand and can relate.Not everything in the story works, however, which is why I knock off a star in my rating. For instance, it isn't even remotely believable that Adam would be able to secretly break into Marisa's house and set up a Christmas tree in her bedroom while she's sleeping, especially in light of the fact that there are other family members sleeping there as well. Dumb. What were the writers thinking?

It deserves a little of both, but it's an okay film.I guess it's successful in one sense at least -- Christian Slater's character does creep me out. But, he also made me think about all the people in our midst who are just a little odd and who are living very lonely lives because of it. So, overall, I would have to say this was a fairly good performance by Slater.Although she's busy enough, I've long felt that Marisa Tomei is an under-appreciated actress. I wouldn't say this is one of her finest roles, but she's good enough in it.Rosie Perez is here as a supporting actress. I don't follow her much, but it seems that every time I do see her in a film that she's playing sort of the same character. Is she type cast? In terms of the story, my complaint is that Slater's character is just a bit too weird to make it work really well. Sort of like the screen writer couldn't finesse anything...just went to an extreme caricature. I note that a couple of our reviewers pointed out that for a winter-time film there were an awfully lot of green leafy trees in a few of the shots. True, although I wouldn't have thought about it if it hadn't been mentioned here.This is an okay film, but it certainly won't end up on my DVD shelf.

As it shows Christian Bale whom everybody predicted to be a big name star but really with the wrong roles he choose prevented that. As Marisa Tomei did not live up to her Oscar winning role in My Cousin Vinny! Still really good with Bale playing Adam a simple minded young 26-year old who is shy, works two jobs, and has never talked to anybody after growing up an orphan with nuns. Marisa is the tough talking Caroline who has had her heart broken one too many times by a bunch of losers.Then after two lowlifes try to rape her, Adam who has been quietly watching out for her as she does not know it at the time. But after she realizes it is him, both begin a quiet and silent relationship.That none of her friends know about. As Adam hardly has any friends at all. But still, Adam will only talk to Caroline as he feels Caroline can relate to him.The movie ends on a bitter sweet note. As the supporting cast lead by Rosie Perez adds nice support to it. Not Oscar worthy but a great and sweet movie. "},{"Title":"Tom's Diner","Date":"18 July 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Sweet at times, Untamed Heart is a largely incredulous romantic drama about a shy guy called Adam (Christian Slater) who falls in love with a cute waitress played by Marisa Tomei.The film is tapping into powerful, primal twin fantasies. Adam is quiet, sexy, strong, and protective, carrying Marisa home, defending her from rapists, showering her with gifts and showing her ceaseless affection. Females in the audience drool when he's on screen.Marisa, meanwhile, is a bundle of sex, walking around in bra and panties, oozing a careful mixture of cuteness, innocence and sexuality and batting her eyelids like a doe-eyed puppy. Guys in the audience drool when she's on screen.Our idealised couple, playing their parts for all the loner's in the world, of course fall in love. They spend Christmas together, kiss, and then Adam dies of a heart condition. From here the film turns into Arthur Hiller's Love Story. While the film is moody in places, has a number of very good scenes, makes interesting use of a Suzanne Vega song, features an atmospheric, noirish diner, and contains cute performances by Slater and Marisa, its impossible to take a film seriously which randomly resorts to heart conditions and out-of-nowhere rape scenes to cook up drama. This is a film which knows that saving a woman﻿ from being attacked (and kicking the attackers butt!) is every male's macho fantasy (and every woman loves a man who will fight for her!), and so literally throws that scene in to bring about its couple's union. Literally.7.5/10 &#x96; The Twilight of the 90s. "},{"Title":"Unrealistic and bizarre as a romance, but very sweet as a fairy tale.","Date":"5 January 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" One more time this comment does contain spoilers!I just saw this for the first time; I enjoyed the romance but felt a little bewildered by how implausible the whole thing was. Perhaps I should have watched it in 1993 to really understand it. Or more to the point, it's best approached as a fantasy, and not as a realistic romantic story.First off Both characters are just plain naive. And yes, I know that's what the whole movie is about, but it could be a turnoff for some, so you've been warned. These are adults in their 20s, but they seem more like 14 years old enjoying their very first crush. So be prepared to just accept the assumption that these people are essentially kids in puppy love.One thing that really bothered me - SPOILER! - was the revelation that the boy had been stalking the girl even up to the point of breaking into her house to watch her sleep. That's seriously creepy. Fortunately Christian Slater plays the innocent well enough that we can believe his motivations were totally pure and romantic, but that doesn't change how weird his behavior really is. If a boyfriend of 2 weeks told me he'd broken into my house to watch me sleep, my reaction would certainly not be a big bewildered hug. No wonder she had been such fodder for other, more abusive men in the past. As usual I begin with my list of complaints, so now for the reason I did in fact love this movie this movie is just plain sweet. Only sweet, no more and no less, but if you're looking for something to make you cry and believe in love, you'll be very satisfied. It does pure tender romance perfectly, and is surprisingly well crafted. The chemistry is believable and the acting is great all around; I willingly suspended my disbelief when it turned out - of course - that the silent and presumably retarded boy is in fact very intelligent and perceptive.That type of beauty-and-the-beast storyline is pretty much what these romances are all about, complete with very traditional gender roles, helplessness, and codependency. If you can tolerate such a naive and simplistic view of love, you'll enjoy the quality of this film. It just feels good, unrealistic as it may be.Warning don't let any teenage girls see it, lest they develop an unhealthy knight in shining armor or I can change him obsession. The characters don't have time to grow together - by the end of the movie, they are still in their 20s, holding even deeper faith in the innocence and purity of true love.As a real-world romance this would get a 5 or less, but as a fantasy romance, it's a solid 9 out of 10.

I so loved this film-it is one of the best films i have ever seen-seriously. It is a classic love story-a real weepy. I think the story line is so satisfying-you find yourself gripped by the romance on the screen and as soon as it's finished you want to watch it again and again. I would highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. Christian Slater if just brilliant in it-his performance is so sweet and touching-it makes you simply fall in love with him. Anyone who likes romance flicks will just adore this film. It is quite simply a must see movie-i recommend you go and and buy it-you will not regret it.

A genre classic that deserves to be a part of any collection. If you like this, I also recommend 'Say Anything' and 'Before Sunrise' for the perfect romantic trilogy.

Christian Slater is one of my favorite actors and Marisa Tomei is one of my favorite actresses.  So naturally, it was a joy to see them on screen together.  However, I still think Slater was slightly miscast, though his performance was impressive.  I just felt, as I started to ponder the film's credibility more and more, that if this were a real situation I don't think the character of Adam would be as handsome as Christian Slater.  But it can happen by coincidence.  That was just a minor flaw I was able to point out.  Yes, this is a pretty sappy romance with one too many I Love You monologues by Tomei's character.  The story is relatively predictable.  The ending is depressing, but it's one of those sad endings you can kind of see coming.  *THIS MAY BE A POTENTIAL SPOILER*  Slater gets put in the hospital after the guys he beat up (for trying to rape Tomei) stabbed him, in a vow of revenge.  Since he has a defective heart, the doctors want to give him a heart transplant.  But he violently refuses.  He wants his own heart.  Even though this heart is believed to be from a babboon.  So he rids himself from the hospital bed, escapes and comes limping to Tomei's doorstep in terrible shape, exactly when Tomei calls up fellow waitress Rosie Perez asking if he's at work.  His heart's in bad shape, but he still loves Tomei with all his heart--Well, with whatever's left.  OK, that was mean.  But I'm still laughing.  There's some unnecessary dialogue and moments where the drama is pushed to melodrama--in other words, it has elements of a Lifetime Movie of the Week.  The opening scene contains the usual breakup and a pretty obvious setup.  Tomei gets ready for a hot date, overdoing the makeup and making sure she looks like a princess, then she hops into her boyfriend's truck and he gives her EVERY romantic cliche in the book.  It's not you, it's me.  Gee, I never heard that one before!  OK, I know I'm listing a lot of flaws.  I probably scared you away from renting this movie, and now it's time to clear things up.  If you're a sucker for romantic tear-jerkers, you'll absolutely LOVE this movie!  I'm not a sucker for ANY movie.  I'm a huge movie buff, and I don't discriminate against finding flaws in any genre of movies.  So I hope females don't read this and say, He's a guy.  Naturally, he's not gonna like this movie all that much.  I actually found this movie strangely engaging, probably because of the two performances.  And there were moments of chemistry between the leads that really did spark.  So this is more than a guilty pleasure.  There are cliches, but it's not drowned with cliches and corny sentiment.  Is it worth watching?  Yes.  But if you're a guy and you're watching this with a girl, be sure to purchase a box of Kleenex before heading to the video store.My score  7 (out of 10)   "}{"Title":"An opening experience","Date":"17 January 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I have seen this movie and I think it's excellent work done by Tomei and Slater. When I first saw this movie I had to say to myself I must have this movie, it's a must have to my collection! Christmas time, trying to find belonging. Some of the scenes made me shudder a bit, but once I see it over and over I'll get the hang of it. The high school incident always seems to haunt me. Marissa Tomei is hot, especially in My Cousin Vinny. She should have gotten an Oscar for this movie as well. Christian Slater was awesome for playing Adam. He may have been an outsider, but he was very helpful despite his sick nature. At least he got a chance to be close to people.It was sad that he died, but it showed he had fulfilled his wishes all the way through I give this film (****1/2)out of five stars.

Who are these people? Their comments are so ludicrous, one even talking about heart surgery...Duh! This is a modern Urban Fairy Tale; that's what the late Gene Siskel called it. But it's also an extremely touching story of true love. So what if his scars don't look right. The story is the thing here! It's a wonderful story, and only made better by the performances of the cast. Marissa Tomei has never been better and is so believable as Caroline. So is Christian Slater in what I would call his best role ever. Rosie Perez adds a touch of sass and the rest are equally believable. I watched them film this movie on my way to work, where the house/set was in Northeast Minneapolis. I passed the vans and trailers every day for a few months. I thought this would ruin the film for me, but when Marissa appears on screen she takes you away into her world. This should have had some Oscar nominations, but those voters don't see every movie. They don't know what's going on. If you want to enjoy a good movie, buy or rent this one.

I might have thought it was a bit better if someone had done their research on Adam's heart operation. Am I the only one who noticed that the scar was incredibly hokey? Perhaps I'm the only one who cares. I mean, the doctors would've had to saw through 8 or 9 ribs to get at his heart. Typically, for open-heart surgery, they cut down the length of the sternum. My brother had an operation for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) at about the same time period Adam had his..the scar is incorrect.
