[{"Title":"Charm AND Substance","Date":"18 October 2004","Score":"45 out of 46 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Why can't American directors make movies like this? It's quiet, calm, small, understated, beautifully paced (read slow and leisurely) and thought-provoking. The premise of the movie is not whether opposites attract (which would be nothing new) but whether our preconceptions often keep us closed down to new people and new experiences. With some gentle nudges, the characters in this lovely movie take deep breaths, look again at people and situations, and see what had been missed before. And yes, it does make us think about how art enriches us and helps us abandon the old preconceptions. Jean-Pierre Bacri is, as usual, splendid, making himself mildly repulsive and appealing, almost simultaneously (though he ends up definitely on the appealing side of the line.) How does he do it? And it's a treat to know that the actress playing the younger woman, Manie, is both the film's director and screenwriter. If you want to know what I mean about pacing, just watch the main character, Clara, as she comes out of cafe after having been stood up for an English lesson. An American director would have cut the scene as she leaves the cafe and bustles across the street in the rain, annoyed and wound up tight as a drum. But in this movie, the camera follows Clara as she walks in the rain down a long street - the shot just lasts forever, and you can see all of Clara's irritation dissipating and turning into loneliness. It's a beautiful shot.

Initially they see him as a Philistine and treat him as a joke, but their attitudes change when he becomes a potential buyer for their work. Meantime, his interior designer wife is forcing her chintzy styles onto his sister who has moved in nearby, and his bodyguard and his driver are having to deal with their own shortcomings in their amorous encounters with a local barmaid.The interwoven sub-plots, the intelligent characterisation and the witty dialogue make this a sophisticated drama in the best sense. The film indulges neither the shallow bourgeoisie nor the supercilious bohemians, but all the characters are real and believable.If the plot offers no easy solutions to the complex needs and insecurities of its characters, it does at least show each of them, in his or her own way, learning something significant about themselves and about other people. The two leading characters in particular come to see each other in a more accepting light, and a direction for the future is opened up.The confidence, intelligence and humour with which director Agnes Jaoui presents these tangled lives are a pleasure to experience, and she offers a refreshing and very European alternative to the more clichéd characterisation favoured by Hollywood.

Matrix-loving-popcorn heads can give this one a miss and hurry to the next American Pie infantalia. What a joy, too, to realize that the Cesars got it right this time around and handed this entry a bagful.  There is so much to ENJOY here from the circular storyline - Castella owns a factory and employs a chauffeur and a bodyguard.  His wife drags him to the theatre where a neice is appearing in 'Berenice', a French classic in verse.  Castella is a complete philistine from the shoes up and would rather give the play a miss and come back for the curtain.  BUT, surprise, surprise, playing the lead is Clara Davaux, a woman he had interviewed as an English teacher and dismissed without a second thought.  Now, he sees her in a new light and falls in mid-life crisis.  Clara drinks and eats in a bar where Manie works.  Manie deals on the side. Castella drops in for a bite to eat with chauffeur and bodyguard.  It seems that the chauffeur has had sex with Manie and does not remember. They resume their relationship whilst Castella now books English lessons from Clara like there's no tomorrow. The chauffeur introduces Manie to the bodyguard and before long he and Manie are in the sack as well. All roads lead back to Castella and after being attacked he winds up in Manie's bathroom for some tlc.  By now he has declared his feelings for Clara and been deep-sixed, yet when she stars as Hedda Gabler she longs to see him in the audience. The acting is so perfect it makes your teeth ache.  The scene where Castella reads Clara a poem he has written for her is painful to watch because it is written and acted with such honesty.  Both writers - Jean-Pierre Bacri (Castella) and Agnes Jaoui (Manie), who also directed, have not flinched from writing scenes in which they come off the worse for wear.  Of course, with the track record of Jaoui and Bacri - before this they wrote and starred in On Connait le Chanson and Un air de famille - you expect only the finest and that is what they deliver here, even Bacri's character name, Castella, has overtones of Bob Castella, the great pianist-composer who was, for decades, the accompanist for Yves Montand.  I can only guess whether any homage was intended but whether or not it is just another bonus to an unforgettable film.

The title might say it all every character tries to please someone else, in other words, tries to meet the taste of the others. Sadly, it seems a very difficult result to accomplish, since the fate of everyone is bound to solitude and misunderstanding. There seems to be one exception to the rule surprisingly, it is the character that, for all the movie long, has been treated like the most foolish and disgusting (Castella). The end does not tell, we don't know whether he and his beloved, funny and complicated actress will meet. At least, he tried to change its life and, whilst trying to get closer to her (pretending to love art and theater), he discovers something deeper and true about himself. In this respect, a happy end would have been completely inconsistent with the movie and would not have added anything to the depiction of the characters. People get close only to lose each other, the director seems to say. The driver's girl will not come back from America, the barmaid and the former policeman are not corageous enough to make the first step. A fine written movie as it is rare to see these days (8/10).

Echoes of Bacri's erstwhile partner-in-crime, Resnais, abound in image and in the weight of unspoken actions. These glances and comedic zooms denoue with the sharpness of Tati, without clouding the gravity of the story.And it is a meticulously woven story they Jaoui gives us, at a pace that might leave an impatient viewer distracted. Tracking Bacri, smooth pans move ethereally through Petit-Bourgeois sets, ever pressing the banality of her subject. The middle-aged businessman in mid-life crisis is a bittersweet choice for comedy bitter in its reality and sweet in the familiarity, he is tantamount to a French David Brent. Castella is a character whose weakness is sympathetic to the point of embarrassment.By contrast, the hand-held and quick cutting that accompanies the theatre troupe and artists expresses the impatience we see in their speech, the bitter jealousy of the unsuccessful and arrogant intellectual. An attack on 'her own people', Jaoui here takes a dig at many of her peers in favour of the senior man, giving Devaux hints of the autobiographical that echo down to Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino.A soundtrack bridging centuries evokes the knowledge of the older man on screen as well as of the auditorium. Kathleen Ferrier's warble punctuates moments of silence as we observe Castella's nonplussed expression, while Metheny and Murray smash and spark away in background to the Bohemians. These interludes mark sea changes in viewer sympathy, serving to give some degree of cultural empathy to the characters.Above all, though, the music and rhythm of cinematography, script and music span great clashes in taste. A mesh of contempt and desire that result in a rounded and masterful work, with appeal for all but with affection for those with grey streaks in their hair.

I should have reserved the definition for her debut, The Taste of Others (2000) which was nominated for the Oscar as The Best Foreign Film and for nine Cesars. The film received four Cesars, including two for Jaoui, for Best film and Best Writing that she shared with her off-screen husband and co-star/co-writer, Jean-Pierre Bacri. The film deserves them all. It belongs to one of my favorite genres of different kind of comedy, subtle, depending not on laughing out loud situations and the funny clichés but on the genuineness of the characters and their interactions. It is a character driven film, and every character is alive, real, often weak and even boring but as their stories interweave, we began to see how much the movie has to say about many important things and how well it did so. What really attracts me to Agnes Jaoui's film is non-judgment of the main characters but the interest to and understanding them. This is the French film in the best meaning of the word - not glamorous, without expensive set decorations or breathtakingly beautiful lead heroes whose passion would burn the screen, no, it is quiet, ironic, elegantly constructed, it moves on its own relaxed pace, but it never drags, and its every word, smile, look, and sound combine in a wonderful watching experience. I also see it as a young writer/director/star's comment on the importance of art in our lives, and how it can really change a person and their outlook. One more thing, I simply admire Jaoui's taste in music. The scores for this film and for Look at Me include the examples of some of the most beautiful classic music ever written.

Personally I'm used to subtitles (over here we only get to see the movies in the original version, so always with subtitles), but I know that many of you aren't. But no problem, because I guess this is a movie that will only be seen by people that like European movies anyway. Don't expect any Hollywoodian action scenes or big explosions. This is a movie about love, appreciating each others opinions,...This movie has been built around six characters. Three men and three women who have completely different tastes and opinions are brought together by circumstance. Castella is the owner of a trucking company who is married to a jobless interior decorator (only because her taste is awful). When his wife takes him to a play, he sees Clara, a forty-year-old actress, who isn't all too successful in her career. He immediately falls in love with her and tries to find ways to be with her as much as possible. Bruno is Castella's driver and Franck is his temporary bodyguard while he negotiates a contract with Iranians. Trough Bruno, Franck meets Manie, a barmaid who deals hash. They begin an affair...In my opinion this movie lacked something, although I'm not really able to describe what it was. It just never grabbed me by the throat and pulled me completely into its story. Perhaps I'm a bit too young for this movie (I'm in my late twenties) and therefor maybe not really able to fully understand the world in which these people live (midlife crisis, so many uncertainties at an age that you can't deal with them anymore...). I don't know what it was, it just didn't completely work for me.It's not that I don't like non-American movies, because I certainly do. A large part of the movies that I've seen are European and a few come from Asia and South-America. If I would make a favorite movies-list, you might be surprised of how many 'foreign' movies can be found in it. I love the Italian, Scandinavian and Spanish movies most, but I also enjoyed several Belgian (let me be a bit of a good patriot for once), German and French movies, but I'm afraid this one will not be a part of that list.Anyway, as this movie teaches us everybody is entitled to have his own opinion.

It isn't just that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It's that others see different things in people.I have a friend who can transform music for me, just by liking it herself. Music that is 'not my taste' comes alive when she says she likes it. Suddenly I become the person with a certain taste to the person with no taste.This is exactly what happens to characters in this movie. Castella is the pivot around which the various characters of this movie turn. He presents as a tactless embarrassment, a nouveau rich (please excuse my French) who travels with a bodyguard, Bruno. Castella doesn't care if Bruno is bored or not; it's his job. And there are other characters.

In giant yellow letters were reviews saying wittyand laugh-provoking and so I naturally thought the film would be a comedy. Well, to me it really wasn't. I did laugh once very briefly--and a small laugh at that. Now this ISN'T meant as negative criticism--the film's makers were not responsible for how it was mismarketed. The movie still worked for me as a romance but only once I let go of my expectations and forced myself to watch through the first 20 or so minutes (which were pretty slow), I found the movie interesting and different--something that occurs too seldom with films. I wouldn't strongly advise a person to seek out the movie, but it's a harmless diversion.The main theme of the movie is mismatched pairs. Mr. Castella is in an unhappy marriage and most of this seems to be because his wife hates people--making herself a lousy partner. The one laugh I had was when this terrible woman's dog bites a passerby. Instead of showing any sympathy, she blames the man! Then, you find out her dog bites people all the time but it's always the victim's fault! Mr. and Mrs. Castella go to a play and Mrs. Castella talks through much of the play and finds fault with everything. Mr. Castella usually hates the theater but is mesmerized by the performance of one of the actresses--the same lady who is also his English language tutor. Mr. Castella spends much of the movie trying to hang around this actress and her bohemian friends--even though he really has nothing in common with them and appears to have no chance with the lady.There are a couple parallel plots that also have to do with mismatched couples. One is Mrs. Castella who tries for once to reach out to another person--in this case, her estranged sister-in-law. Another involves a drug-selling lady who works in a bar and is pursued by a conservative man! All these relationships are difficult, if not impossible to believe. Some work out, some do not. Despite me NOT believing the old axiom that opposites attract, the film is clever and well made--with very believable and low-key acting by people who act like real people. I respect the film a lot--though I didn't find myself thrilled enough to understand how it was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar. But what do I know?Incidentally, Jean-Pierre Bacri not only played Mr. Castella but he also wrote the screenplay.

Here we have four or five interwoven plot lines,  following six or seven main characters, not episodically as in, eg Short Cuts or Magnolia, but more continuously and smoothly. The writing, direction and editing are almost flawless, and even with the burden of English sub-titles there is no difficulty in following the film. It is a remarkable directorial debut for Agnes Jaoui, who also jointly wrote it, and has a main role.The central plot concerns the relationship between wealthy businessman Castella (Jean-Pierre Bacri, the other joint-writer) and actress/English teacher Clara (Anne Alvaro); through her, he is drawn into an artistic circle, where initially he is a fish out of water, but gradually assets himself. Other story lines involve Castella's wife, sister, chauffeur, bodyguard, and a waitress/hash dealer (played by Jaoui).The downside of the film for me is that its overall messages - that it takes all sorts to make a world; that we should be tolerant; and that sometimes (but not always) opposites attract - are  rather simplistic, and are hammered home too heavily in the closing sequences.  There is another theme to the film that might be missed - the power of the arts to enrich people's lives. It is noticeable that Castella is not struck by Clara when he first meets her; it is when he sees her on stage that he is moved by both her and the role she is playing. Later, when he goes to the opening of an exhibition of abstract paintings, he buys one, and commissions the artist to decorate the facade of his factory. When he declares his love for Clara, it is in the form of a simple poem - probably the first he has ever written. Most of the characters, even Clara, finish up more or less where they started in the film; but Castella has travelled a real distance.

Perhaps I should have seen 'The Taste of Others' first as it is the counter-point to Jaoui's follow-up as it is about a slow unwitting change.After watching 'Taste/Others', I read reviews including a perceptive one by Roger Ebert, though I felt like Peter Bradshaw, that this film didn't leave as strong impression as I thought it would. It was interesting to read about Agnes Jaoui & Jean-Pierre Bacri's style, ensemble pieces with shifting story lines which make their films difficult to categorise after twenty minutes in. And 'The Taste of Others' is a film about individuals who cannot be easily categorised.It is initially about Castella, an unsophisticated businessman who is drawn to Clara, an actress & part-time English teacher. She appears in Racine's 'Berenice', a play about a lover spurned because of Roman society's disapproval of her, echoing how her coterie of friends disapprove of Castella later. Her impassioned performance leaves Castella moved. This is a subtle film where scenes inform each other. Life imitates art. Later, we see that her performance is not that far off from her own disappointments in life &#x96; as a middle aged actress going nowhere &#x96; during a heartfelt confession to her friend Manie. Clearly, Castella possesses a much more sophisticated eye than we first realise in contrast to his sometimes rough manner.The film then broadens out to become a variant on a theme, examining a number of relationships as a loose collection of characters are drawn together. Castella has a bodyguard, Franck, a former policeman with serious issues about trust (personal & professional) and his chauffeur, Bruno. The film becomes an intricate & deftly written ensemble piece as two apparently disparate, incompatible groups of characters, inhabiting very different social milieus (commerce v art, conventional v bohemian), come into contact, clash and eventually reach some kind of rapprochement.After a brief fling with Bruno, Manie & Franck become mutually attracted despite themselves, with Bruno more preoccupied with his girlfriend in the US. In a sense, you wonder if Franck's profession as a bodyguard is another comment on the story he may offer physical protection but the film is about emotional vulnerability, how we are touched despite ourselves and dropping our emotional guards. And in the end, Franck doesn't manage to protect Castella on the one occasion he is needed.The film is about unlikely romances and friendships (Castella & the gay arty bohemians Antoine & Benoit, his wife Angelique & her long suffering sister-in-law who offers her comfort, even background characters like Valerie, Clara's friend, with a bar-owner). Initially, Castella is drawn both to Clara and her bohemian world with comical results, his ignorance sent up by the cruel mockery of the arty set, but they, too, in a way are guilty of making assumptions by failing to see Castella's hidden depth & open-mindedness.Clare maintains a wary distance of Castella after he makes a clumsy declaration of his feelings in English, but it is when the businessman resignedly accepts her apparent lack of interest, that Clara begins to realise her own feelings. I did feel that this could have been explored in more detail. For much of the film, she keeps him at arm's length and then towards the end desperately seeks his presence.I have to admit that I didn't found the film uproariously funny as others. There are amusing moments such as when Manie tells a non-plussed Bruno that they once slept together; the scene where famous tragic playwrights are described as comedians or my personal favourite, the scene in the nightclub where Castella, Franck & Bruno all sit glumly together clearly wishing they could be somewhere else.'The Taste of Others' deals with emotional themes with a light touch though there is a note of sadness at the end that falls short of tragedy. Franck has long regarded Bruno's attachment to his stuttering long-distance relationship as naïve but it is the bodyguard who ultimately cannot move on or take the leap of faith required when he goes back to Manie to seek a reconcilement. Bruno phlegmatically accepts, with a Gallic shrug of the shoulders, that such is life when his girlfriend ends their relationship.

Instead of those wrapped-too-tight Manhattanites and their 85-room apartments (very common in NYC), we get a dufus businessman's Norman cottage done up in Late Laura Ashley and the tiny piaules where a cute waitress (Jaoui, who also directed) cooks pasta for her boyfriends and deals a little hash or, as the case might be, a lovelorn chauffeur practises his flute. As the title suggests, there's an element of culture clash&#x97;M. Castella, the businessman (Bacri), is blown away by an actress's performance in a Racine tragedy (Crap, it's poetry!, he grumbles as the play begins), but she can't get too interested, at least in principle, in a guy who tells peepee-caca jokes and confuses Rigoletto with the Juanita Banana jingle (she doesn't even know about the Danielle Steele thing&#x85;). And as with Woody, the script does pander a bit&#x97;M. Castella finally gets it right when he buys an opera CD and, to atone for an antigay slur at a gallery opening, an abstract painting that clashes with his wife's decor. Likewise, there's a funny moment when M. Castella's tough-guy bodyguard, Frank, exercises his droit de coolest guy in the room (trying hard to avoid a spoiler here), but it's the flute-playing chauffeur, Bruno, who turns out to be the better man. I'm not sure there are too many life lessons for us here, but The Taste of Others is lively and involving from start to finish; the dialogue is sharp and slangy, and if you learned French in school, you may pick up some useful new words. I'd encourage you to catch it while it's still on streaming Netflix.

I have never ended a film before it was over but pulled this one out of the DVD player after about 45 minutes. The characters were perhaps a bit more believable than the ones in La Potiche but not by much. The situations weren't much more believable than the characters and the film in general is depressing and slow.

This is a bigger thing in France than here in Austrlia, and the French language equivalent of the phrase 'bad taste' which is 'de mauvais gout' is to be avoided. Although in Australia we love to laugh at Kath & Kim, and 'The Castle', which represents bad taste to us.The thing is, some people seem to act like taste is a matter of 'breeding' and education. For example you may currently line your shelves with Toby mugs, and have personalised numberplate's, but with a little (or a lot depending on how little 'breeding' you have) education you are not beyond an appreciation of the maxim less is more.However this film shows that while Castella maybe seen as uncouth, in the way that he would prefer Pro Hart to Sidney Nolan, Robert G. Barrett to Peter Carey, these loves are his loves, and he should not also be seen as 'thick' because of them. Or perhaps the elements of pop culture (or even kitsch culture) have the same intrinsic value, as those of high culture.I personally found it a more enjoyable film because of this element to the story.

I still miss if after 10 years and long to return home again. This film looks at the loneliness of people even the married ones or involved ones. It always appears like everybody is in their own little world of loneliness. Well, the writing is good but then again I was reading subtitles and trying to remember my French lesson plans as well.

Such that something one contact says to another is then taken out of context to cause communication problems when it's passed on to another.A lot of the triumph has to do with director/co-writer Agnes Jaoui's penchant for long shots and her trust in the actors (but then she and her husband--who also co-wrote the script--are also co-stars, though not an on-screen couple). For example, two casual lovers meet up in a restaurant, and the guy introduces her to his co-worker. That sparks fly between the new pair is communicated without close-up leers or touching and with bare conversation. The woe-be-gone boss drags two employees to a strip joint for distraction, and that each guy is at a different stage in his romantic travails is reflected in each's face and body language-- and we never even see the strippers, something Hollywood can never resist showing. We root for the unexpected couples as well as their self-understanding, and they make unexpected yet believable choices. The naturalness of their interactions is laugh-out-loud funny in a knowing way, and breath-catchingly poignant.Those of you intellectuals who are already familiar with Hedda Gabler won't be sandbagged by one scene as I was.It deservedly won a slew of French Cesars.(originally written 3/3/2001) "},{"Title":"Excellent, thoughtful film about tolerance and cultural elitism","Date":"23 October 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Agnes Jaoui directs this film which makes a strong case for tolerance-but not simply for liberals and artists and those for whom the claim for tolerance is often made, but also for those who are possibly more old-fashioned or perhaps not as progressive but who just don't realize all the artistic and cultural life in the world.This is a very clever film, well-crafted and even-handed to all. It is about an actress, Clara (played as a jaded, depressed, but ultimately optimistic person by Anne Alvaro) who is a- woman-of-a-certain-age and who, while professionally somewhat successful, is lonely and would like to have a child before the window on that opportunity closes. Separately, as the film begins, Castella (director and character Manie (Agnes Jaoui)'s real life husband, Jean-Pierre Bacri) is a successful businessman who is in negotiations for a possibly huge payday with some Iranian businessmen. However, he is frustrated by the routine of his life, and perhaps its predictability, not to mention his shallow, superficial wife Angelique (Christiane Millet), whose main concern in life seems to be the tastefulness of her home. She also, quite humorously, questions the judgment of numerous people whom her spoiled dog attempts to bite. She thinks that the dog is always justified in biting them and obliquely blames them for provoking her dog. This is a funny sub-plot throughout the film.Not surprisingly, Castella is brusque and abrasive, so when he meets Clara who also serves as a private English tutor, he is surprised to discover that, while she is not like most people he knows, he is interested in her and what makes her tick. He is almost completely culturally ignorant; however when he attends a Shakespeare play a niece is in and finds Clara performing in that, he is suddenly transfixed (attracted not just to her but to the power of the arts-and perhaps he is not even consciously attracted to her at that point-he is just intrigued by the power of the arts). He begins to put extra effort into learning English and also attends her other plays, not only to impress her, but also to better himself. It's clear that he is interested in Clara and increasingly wants to broaden his horizons, particularly from his petty, small-minded wife.One can see that this is another world opening up to him that he was ignorant of but which seems to have shaken him from his cloistered world. Clara is a little-less-than-sure that she appreciates his ever increasing interest in her though. In fact she absolutely is not attracted to him, at least at first, ironically believing him too philistine and brutish. Although well-intentioned, Castella is, as stated, culturally ignorant, and his tastes seem to them too gauche by half. They mock him by maintaining during a dinner conversation that Ibsen was a light-hearted playwright and by pretending to enjoy his bland, juvenile humor while they laugh behind his back. As this happens more and more, Clara becomes more upset with these artistic friends (Wladimir Yordanoff, Xavier de Guillebon, Raphael Dufour, Anne Le Ny) for belittling a man whose interest in their work is, ironically, more serious than their attitudes towards almost everything. While Castella becomes more versed in cultural works, it's not clear that Clara's friends are any more appreciative of his company, although Weber (Xavier de Guillebon) is happy to take the large commission Castella offers him for a fresco on the front of his office. There are misunderstandings on both sides, but what is interesting about this film is that, while Hollywood could not make a film like this without mocking Castella remorselessly, in this film, one ultimately feels more sympathy for him than for the artists who are often the victims of humiliation and harassment. Also crucial to the film, and excellent in their performances, are the director herself, Agnes Jaoui as Manie, a bartender who sells a bit of weed on the side to make ends meet. She is the very definition of a free-spirit, seemingly not overly bothered by anything. She has a fling with Bruno (Alain Chabat), Castella's bodyguard during the negotiations for the Iranian contract. Bruno claims to have bedded 300 women and seems detached and uninvested in relationships. He and Mani have the same sort of attitude toward relationships, it would seem, but he is critical of her selling marijuana and ultimately their relationship proves unsalvageable. Without giving too much away, the ending of the film seems fair, based on what we know about the characters. Jaoui gives all the characters adequate screen time and controls characters' revelations well, allowing for disclosure at a good rate-not disclosing too much too quickly, allowing the characters to mature. Jaoui and Bacri are excellent. Bacri, while I don't know his work, would seem to be a very capable actor. Perhaps it is his resemblance to Peter Sellers, but I thought he would make a fabulous comic actor. He seems to have a wonderful control of playing the straight man, as people such as Leslie Nielsen and Peter Sellers have done so well. Jaoui, I also liked. Apart from the fact she is very cute =) she is the most level-headed in this film, it seems to me, never allowing much to get her too up or too down. An excellent, very insightful meditation on the human condition. Very enjoyable and yet you realize you've seen a very insightful film too. This revelation creeps up on one.

Or indeed, the issue of how much say we even have in our choices also permeates the whole film, with the boss Caralla intrigued by a high culture he'd always disdained but without the codes to access it (symbolised by his difficulties mastering another code, that of the English language). At the end, a hopeful note is struck, when there is a moment of recognition across these barriers of taste, when Caralla and his English teacher realise that the taste of others is what adds spice to life. There are the odd slow moments, but there are also funny and intensely moving scenes, and Bacri is an incredibly endearing screen presence.
