I just don't understand it -- I love this movie!  It successfully continues the underlying theme of the original (unlike a lot of sequels which seem to forget their points entirely) gremlins are mythical creatures blamed for mechanical errors (if an appliance is broken, it must have been the work of gremlins).  In this movie, the gremlins are loose in a totally automated high-rise office building, already suffering from its own malfunctions, which serves as the perfect playground for them.  Charles Haas' script is absolutely hilarious, filled with more movie in-jokes than I can recall seeing in a single movie, and it even pokes fun at the more serious original.  In fact, I think many people disliked this film because of its total irreverence compared to the first; it didn't try to be scary for a second and Rick Baker's creature effects turned out goofier than Chris Walas's original creature designs.  Just realize...this is a comedy! Definitely worth seeing more than once to catch the barrage of jokes and references...and sit all the way through the credits!

I remember the movie posters in the streets and the wacky preview for it on TV. I'm now 20 years old, and this is still one of my most favourite movies of all time. It's even better than the original, I believe. The reason I love it so much is because it is so damn strange. It really, really is! It's like a live action Looney Tunes episode. The gremlins are wacky, Gizmo is cute and mysterious, the human actors are all brilliant in their roles and the New York building setting is well, neat.The basic premise for this movie picks up a few years after the first Gremlins movie. This time however, it takes place in the busiest city on the planet, New York.The movie opens with the death of Gizmo's frail Chinese owner. In accordance with the owners death, the place where Gizmo is kept is demolished by a bulldozer and recking ball. Terrified, Gizmo flees from the building and into an alley where he is plucked up by a scientist and brought to the Clamp Cable Network building. The building belongs to media mogul Daniel Clamp and contains a vast variety of shops including coffee houses, restaurants, dental clinics and science laboratories.Coincidentally, Billy and Kate are both working in the same building. Billy is in the art department and Kate gives guided tours of the building. It is here that they stumble upon Gizmo and the inevitable happens.I won't give anymore of the story line away. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I urge you to. It may not be brilliant in the eyes of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but it is in my eyes. 10 stars!

When I saw that there was to be this sequel 6 years later I was very pleased indeed. What I hadn't bargained for was the sharpness of the writing and the satirical structure that director Dante laid out for audiences to watch.Focusing very much on the then modern obsessions like tearing things down to build state of the art monstrous complexes, or the need for a better world; be it the laboratory testings for better life forms, or machines to run our lives; Gremlins 2 plays out as a sort of morality tale that sees the creatures themselves as byproducts of the human condition. In true classic creature feature fashion, Dante manages to garner a level of sympathy for the Gremlins. These vile offspring of the offspring are party animals, they have fun, they like to sing and go nuts, they are in short, quite like a stag party on the Costa Del Sol! Throwing in as many film references as it can, Gremlins 2 may have a satirical slant at it's heart, but sure enough the fun from the first film segues nicely into this picture to make this one of the better, and more smarter sequels on the market.And those darn Gremlins are nastier and uglier than ever as well! 8/10 "},{"Title":"Blame the gremlins for everything","Date":"9 September 1999","Score":"33 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  To this day my friend and I still refer to the gremiln like he is real.  When something goes wrong with my computer, it is the gremlin, when my keys are misplaced and then show up in a spot that you swear you checked before, it was the gremlin, when something, anything goes wrong, it has to be the gremlin.  I am actually convinced that Spike has taken on a life of his own (kinda the way Freddy did in Wes Craven's New Nightmare) and lives to make my life difficult.  Joe Dante's Gremlin's has had that much of an impact on my life.  Gremlins was a wonderful film and it was a little more creepy than it was funny.  But make no mistake about this one, it is one of the funnier movies that I've seen.  It abandons all that was scary and atmospheric in the first and just adds comedy a-plenty.  And I would seriously put this humour up against some of the funnier comdies of the 90's.This time the adventures of Magwai and Spike reach a skyskraper like building owned by a guy that has to be a distant cousin of Donald Trump.  And if you think back to Gremlins, remember how much trouble the little guys could get into using simple household products (microwave, chimney etc ) well that is nothing compared to what they can do at an office filled with the latest technology.  There are also many many inside jokes about Hollywood and such that you have to watch it several times to pick up on all of them.  What is also great about the film is the two versions ( one for the theater and one for the VCR )  I remember when I saw this in the theater I really thought something was wrong with the projector when it first went all strange.  And I like the fact that the makers of this had the guts and the gaul to try something new like that.  It kind of reminds me of Something About Mary when at the end the entire cast is singing that song.  The movie never stops trying to entertain, and that is what I got from this film too.  It will do anything to make you laugh, even throw in a little Hulkamania when he was cool.Gremlins 2 is one of the funniest films that you will see.  And I'm just a little surprised that Joe Dante isn't still active so much in the business anymore.  He made some great films and I would gladly see anything that he puts his name on.  If you haven't seen this film for quite some time, then I highly suggest that you do see it soon.  I was browsing through Rick Baker's filmography on the IMDb and I came across Gremlins 2.  I rented it the same night and I was very glad I did.  Not only did it make me laugh, it brought me back to a time when films like this and The Goonies and even E.T. were made.  Movies aren't the same anymore and that is not neccessarily a criticism, it is just a comment pointing out that in the early 90's and the 80's movies were just different sometimes.  This is one of the funnier ones, and one of the more entertaining.  Do you remember a film by Amblin that wasn't?

They still look pretty real. What I like best about this film is that it took the hard edge off the first one and made it more of a comedy. To me, this sequel was more entertaining than the first film and one I would watch a lot more times. There are so many jokes and wild scenes in here it would many viewings to catch them all. For movie buffs, it's especially fun with all the references to other films in here.However, it should be pointed out that there are still plenty of scenes where the gremlins are nasty and attack people, so the film is still horror-like in that respect. It may be played for comedic purposes, but these creatures are anything but friendly. In other words, there is still a bit of a hard edge in here for people who want that.After three viewings of this film over the years, the only person who wore thin on me was John Glover's character, Daniel Clamp, an obvious Donald Trump-imitation but grossly overacted by Glover. He winds up just being too silly.Phoebe Cates and Zach Galligan reprise their roles as the cute, small-town, wholesome (despite not being married, however) couple who live together who, of course, know all about these gremlins.It was nice to see Jackie Joseph (of the original Little Shop Of Horrors) again as well as some other well-known characters such as Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky, Dick Miller and Keye Luke. The film just flies by, which tells you it's entertaining.

Three underrated sequels came out in 1990. Predator 2, RoboCop 2, and Gremlins 2. I remember waiting in the lobby of a cinema in Orlando, Florida before a screening of Back to the Future 3, looking at the cardboard standees for Gremlins 2 and RoboCop 2 side by side. My 9-year-old self was a HUGE fan of the first movies and staring at a standee taller than me, featuring wonderful artwork, for those sequels was big deal for me. I pity kids nowadays who don't have the attention span to soak up little moments like that.Dante takes everything that was great about Gremlins and cranks it all the way up to a zillion. The original movie was a dark xmas comedy horror with B-movie undertones. The sequel goes so over-the-top it launches itself into the stratosphere and doesn't come back down until the very, very end of the credits. It's just wall-to-wall mayhem with so many in-jokes it'll make your head explode. The movie even attempts to begin as a Looney Tunes cartoon.Gizmo, now back with Mr. Wing, escapes the curiosity shop after the old man dies and is found by a scientist working at Splice of Life, a laboratory located in the Clamp Premiere Regency Trade Centre and Retail Concourse (a big skyscraper in Manhattan). Working in the art department of that skyscraper is Billy Peltzer, hero of the first film. Billy eventually locates and rescues Gizmo, but he gets wet before Billy can take him home, spawning a new generation of cute, fluffy, malevolent Mogwai (Mohawk, Lenny, Edward G. Robinson-lookalike George, and the absolutely mad Daffy). They eat after midnight at a Yoghurt stand in the lobby. The following day the Clamp building, and all of the tenants (from the Archery Channel to the movie print itself, leading to an amusing cameo from Hulk Hogan) are besieged by a horde of gremlins intent on mass destruction and good times at any cost.One can accuse the film of having no story beyond giving the Gremlins a lively backdrop for their wild antics, but when you're having so much fun isn't that what matters most? Goldsmith's score (sadly underrepresented on the 22-year-old Varese Sarabande CD) has a lot more weight second time around, backed-up by a large orchestra and string-based action cues. You'll absolutely love it! Chris Columbus didn't return for this movie, leaving scripting duties to Charlie Haas. He uses the Gremlins and the location to skewer big city culture and satirize business tycoons. John Glover is brilliant as the easily excitable Daniel Clamp, a Donald Trump-like property magnate who has more money and power than he knows what do with.It's amazing that a third Gremlins movie was never made. Despite it now being 22 years since Gremlins 2 and 28 years since the first movie virtually every kid knows what the Gremlins are and are familiar with Gizmo (who may well be the cutest thing that ever existed). It's still a huge cash cow and a recognizable brand, and why Warner never greenlit Gremlins 3 is puzzling to say the absolute least.One last thing. Stay with this film until the end of the credits.

I begged my mom to take me to see this back in 1990 and thankfully I can say I saw this on the big screen.Years later when I watch it, I can catch all of the little references and nods to other great films of the past. The Warner Brothers Looney Tune cartoons have obviously made an impact on the directorial style of Joe Dante. What's great is the combination of this type of humor blended with these devious little monsters wrecking havoc in the Clamp Building. Speaking of Clamp, John Glover was excellent as Daniel Clamp (a parody of Donald Trump). He's absolutely hilarious!There are many terrific special effects and sequences in the film. It's hard to tell you which scene is my favorite because I adore every moment of the film. I will say one of the scenes that sticks out for me is when the Bat Gremlin flies out into New York City by day. I just love those excellent shots of him flying through the sky. Of course, the Brain Gremlin and the 'New York, New York' number is fantastic as well. Is eeeverybody heere? And who could forget when the Gremlins got their revenge for Leonard Maltin's lambasting of the first Gremlins movie?All this is accompanied by a fantastic Jerry Goldsmith score (which happens to be one of my favorites of his as well). The collaboration between Goldsmith and Dante isn't unlike that of Hitchcock and Herrmann or Spielberg and Williams.The film abounds with dark jollity and watching it you can tell that the filmmakers had a fun time making the picture. To include the audience as part of the goings on, is a real treat.Out of all the thousands of films I have seen, none have been or ever will be more entertaining than Gremlins 2.I LOVE it.

The first film was funny but also scary. Gremlins 2 plays more like a Mel Brooks-type movie with some of the jokes that are in it. But its hardly scary. Plus, it got a little tiresome to watch the gremlins do some of the exact same things that they did the first time around like drinking, smoking, etc. Nevertheless, this is for the most part an entertaining movie that I'd wish had done better at the box office. I think if they had made this three years after the original instead of six years, it would have done better. In between the two Gremlins flicks there were all those ripoffs (Critters, Ghoulies and their sequels) and by 1990 moviegoers became tired of it all.

I was 9 years old when the original GREMLINS was released. Probably smack dab in the middle of the perfect target audience for a fun little horror film full of gleeful gore and maniacal monsters. Due to many factors, a sequel to the mega-hit was not produced for some time afterwards. By the time this was released, I was then 15 and looking for something a little more from my entertainment. The sequel was, then, quickly relegated to a little corner of my memory.Years have elapsed. I have submersed myself in horror films and still, to this day, have an undying love of the original. I can see, now, all of the fun little horror tidbits that Dante hid in his movie for the more adult viewers, while spicing just enough family fun to keep the whole family interested.This movie, though, is lacking any of the charm and craft that made the original so good. What Dante and all involved seem to have forgotten is that the gremlins and mogwai became stars, but what made the original so successful was good writing, a good script and a good plot.This sequel seems hellbent on packing as many different gremlin creations and bad jokes as possible in its' runtime. There is almost no story developed here, at all, and the story that is doesn't make sense half of the time. The plot moves along just enough to propel the viewer from one gag to another, most of which are not funny by child or adult standards, that become a tireless, repetitive bore by the end. Naturally, most of these gags also serve to introduce us to a bevy of new characters, with their own personalities. Yes, it smells a little too much of marketing and the need to create new mogwai/gremlins as if they figured they missed out on something with only having Gizmo and Stripe as recognizable creations in the original. Most of these new creations are even more annoying than the gags.Even the human characters have become cardboard cutouts this time around. Billy and his girlfriend are barely there, just fodder for another gag, or when the plot is needed to move along to the next step. The corporate heads are interesting ideas that become convoluted and, mostly, generic. Even the great Christopher Lee is wasted here in a role that anyone could have filled, as a minor scientist who serves only to introduce the experiments that will, in turn, produce the gallery of gremlin hybrids.Many point out the fun easter eggs in this movie and how much this shows Dante's love of 50s sci fi. Yes, it is fun for a drive-in horror junkie like myself to find those hidden gems and appreciate all the little nods to films of past years that Dante worked in, but that doesn't even come close to saving this movie from being a mess.About halfway through this, my wife and I looked at each other and quickly realized exactly why we had both pushed this to the depths of our subconscious. If you removed the GREMLINS franchise name from this movie, you'd have nothing but a second-rate imitation, which is all this really is in the end.

Child's Play slowly became a complete joke as the series went on. The same with Leprechaun. With Gremlins, it didn't take long at all -- Joe Dante not only mocks his first film but completely parodies it and turns it inside out. We are treated to an endless barrage of non sequitors, in-jokes, and homages to more than a few dozen movies. Most of the references are obscure (such as Dick Miller killing a gremlin in the same manner as his character Walter Paisley from A Bucket of Blood), but that's what makes the film viewable again and again.Those who loved the first may dislike the second, but those who disliked the first may like the second. That Dante is able to switch gears so smoothly is incredible. With the main characters remaining constant, it should bring appeal from one to the other. How often does a sequel keep the core cast and the director? And dudes, this was during Phoebe Cates' adorably cute phase. Not the sexy seductress of Fast Times, but a dollface you can't say no to.I watched this one right after Howling III as I was beginning to sober up from drinking Passport Scotch. I switched to Clan MacGregor Scotch, but my belly was full so I didn't drink nearly fast enough. But I think that's quite alright, as Gremlins II is a timeless classic that should be enjoyed with a clear mind. (But if you want to drink, drink... it won't make the film any worse.) Did I mention Christopher Lee is in here? He is. Why does he have a pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers? Who knows! But his role as a scientist (not a mad one) is perfect for him, and a nice change from his Hammer horror roles as Dracula (though we still get a nice blood drinking reference). It might be one of the appearances by Lee I enjoy the most.If you mixed the original Gremlins with Muppets Take Manhattan (or maybe The Great Muppet Caper), it would be almost like this. Well, maybe not. I don't know. But if you get the chance to see Gremlins II, see it. You've probably already seen it, though, so why am I telling you to see it? You already know.

This time their target is a high-tech corporate skyscraper run by a Trump-like suit.Gremlins 2 The New Batch tries hard enough, and it's certainly original and creative. But it just never really clicks. The film plays like a bad episode of The Muppet Show as the cartoonish gremlins sing musical numbers, destroy property and morph into giant bats and spiders. It repeatedly attempts to poke fun at itself, but those efforts, too, fall flat on their face. Maybe the gremlins just aren't cut out for comedy.

Also the constant Warner Bros. product placement got annoying--and what the hell were Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig doing in this?As for the acting--Galligan and Cates are lousy (no shock there), but John Glover is just great as a Donald Trump-like character.

This movie has more gremlins and them doing mischievous things than the first movie, messing with people and playing mean tricks left and right. The special effects on the monsters were good for the most part (some of the animated sequences does fall flat a little) and the music score was OK. However, the comedic and scary moments turn up flat as much of the acting was pretty goofy, including those of the monsters, and many of the characters acted like clowns, especially the dumb twins and the Media Mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover). The plot went all over the place and wasn't kept quite together as that in the first movie and there were really no scary or jumpy moments. I wished the story showed more bewilderment and fear from the people who witnessed the gremlins' havoc; but, they just showed casual concern and intrigue.Overall, it's not a very good sequel. It doesn't have the character development, unique flavor and suspense as the original movie, instead, it's just a wild crazy-fest of gremlins and overzealous humans trying to deal with all the chaos.

The sequel to the horror/comedy hit back in 1984 does something very few sequels accomplish It respects and stands along the original, but it's even more outrageous and hilarious. Folks, I'm not kidding; this is probably one of the strangest non-drug-induced-pretentious-art-films you will ever see. In spite of that, 'Gremlins 2' is gloriously entertaining and director Joe Dante is at the top of his game.It's been a while since Kingston Falls. Billy (Zach Galligan) and Kate (Phoebe Cates) have moved to New York to work for mogul DanieL Clamp (John Glover). Meanwhile, Gizmo is still at his little Chinatown shop, in mourning for his owner Mr. Wing (Keye Luke). When the shop is torn down, Gizmo escapes but is captured by a scientist from the genetics lab in Clamp's building. The inevitable happens, and now the Gremlins are bigger and badder thanks to the genetics lab. One gremlin's skin turns into vegetables, one becomes a bat, there's an electric gremlin, and there's even Brain Gremlin (voice of Tony Randall), a superintelligent little devil and the ringleader of the new batch. Can the Gremlins be prevented from overrunning New York? If you don't know the answer to that question, you haven't seen enough movies.The main attraction of the film is Gizmo and the Gremlins themselves. Gizmo in particular toughens up and takes a page from Rambo's book (this is funnier than it sounds). The Gremlins are not so much scary this time around; almost every scene with them has some measure of wit. The whole movie feels like a live-action Looney Tunes cartoon, and I cannot express how painfully hilarious 'Gremlins 2' is.The puppetry by Rick Baker is fantastic, the laughs are loud and frequent, and Joe Dante needs an AFI tribute pretty soon.

So I guess when Joe Dante was making the second opus of his 1984 hit Gremlins, the results of Ghostbusters 2, Lethal Weapon 2, Back to the Future part II&#x85; and on the top of them Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade probably made him believe his Gremlins 2 The New Batch, would be a sure lock for a great return of investment. It was not.Maybe 1990 wasn't such a good year for sequels after all&#x85; still, my jaw dropped when I read that the film only grossed 40 millions of dollars out of a slightly superior budget. I don't think it's a result even the most skeptical critics expected; something happened there, let's call it a disastrous and unfortunate accident, nothing that really speaks bad statements about the film's quality. It wouldn't have meant much either had the film made it in the Top 10, I don't think Ghostbusters 2 was anyway superior to Gremlins 2 but it must have met with the fans' expectations, they had their quartet, Billy Murray's wisecracks, a worthy villain and a larger-than-life last-minute savior&#x85; so it was worth the ticket and the popcorn box. So what exactly lacked in Gremlins 2? What didn't lack was the leading pair, Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, the cute Gizmo, his evil descendants, including the Mohawk, and the unforgettable three rules that everyone forget. Was there a lack of originality? Not at all, the film does try to play in a different field than the first, starting with the setting. We're not in the Capra-esque Christmas small town but in New-York giant corporate skyscraper, governed by a Donald Trump-like character named Klamp, it's a terrific setting as it defiantly pretends to create a microcosm of the urban post-modern world in a rather confined environment&#x85; so that it ultimately becomes the Gremlins' ecosystem. Billy and his newlywed wife work together in the building, he's a shy and obedient executive and she's a competent hostess who tries to fit in New York and people's rude manners.The heroes are given more depth and character than in the first film but so are the Gremlins who're not just a generic group of monsters. You have the chief, the goofy one with bulging eyes, one with two visible front teeth, some others will be submitted to genetic transformations including gender-changes, one becomes a spider-hybrid, and another turns into electricity&#x85; no holds were barred, and we could as well have a Gremlin turning into an apple pie or a rubber duck. Too much fun kill the fun, and it's a pity because one special Gremlin was enough, you know which one I mean the intellectual sophisticated Gremlin (voiced by Tony Randall) who could finally raise the Gremlins' voices in a more interesting manner than their usually hyena-like giggling that quickly get tiresome. It's a pity that such a scene-stealing character blooms very late in the film, he's one of the things we remember and one of the aspects that subtly hints the sequel's satirical intent.Indeed, Gremlins 2 is not like any sequel. For one thing, it's pretty much aware of its status as a sequel and doesn't try to be a Gremlins in a building as Die Hard 2 was Die Hard in an airport. The film mocks its own material by toning down the gruesome violence of the Gremlins and emphasizing the jokes and humorous effects. But whether for the Bugs Bunny vs. Daffy opening and some weird comic moments involving a trap door, there is something desperately obvious in the way the filmmakers tell us this is a comedy and at the end, the good gags are quite lost in the midst of these frantic attempts to take distance from the original. Ultimately, what happens with Gremlins 2 is that it takes too much distance from the first film in the wrong time and not enough in the right time.Just when you expect the film to go a little further in its satirical approach, when you think the brainy Gremlin, after such a puzzling speech about the notion of civilization, will lead the Gremlins to something more transcending than the usual mayhem or chaos, well, then the film gets back to the whole 'kill them' issue and becomes a standard action movie. The problem is that the efforts to make the Gremlins look so unique and different didn't have, to me, the right pay-off. I actually felt sorry to see them being killed in an equally blind way, the evil savage ones just like the goofy ones, I would have just loved to see the brain Gremlin survive, because he actually had something more human than the others. Why let the 'action' devices kill the 'satire' ones? Gremlins 2 is undeniably original, and had better intentions than many more successful sequels, it was also served by a nice supporting cast, many prestigious cameos, from the Looney Tunes to Hulk Hogan, from Christopher Lee to Leonard Matlin, but its self-referential approach must have disrupted a majority of teenage fans who probably didn't get all the references to classic films like The Wizard of Oz or Marathon Man. I mentioned that the first movie also suffered from a kind of schizophrenia as it was trying to be a horror-B movie and a 'family' Christmas story, but those were twists in the formats while Gremlins 2 tries to be two different things tone-wise, and it didn't quite succeed although it had some great potential.Three years later, another movie would suffer the same fate, and would be a box-office flop due to a similar misunderstanding, Last Action Hero. These things happen and I guess some movies doesn't get the recognition they deserve. Bad luck.

One of the rules to Gizmo is never get him wet. Of course, a plumber sprays water from a fountain and it hits Gizmo unleashing the devilish monsters.The story is basically that. But where the movie succeeds in is the actual portrayal of the monsters themselves. They were mischievous and comical in the first one, but they go all out for laughs in Gremlins 2. The Gremlins sing a rendition of Start Spreading the News, one of them wears make up and tries to be seductive, a few of them take over a cooking show being filmed in progress. It's all pretty funny stuff. The major problem I had with the first Gremlins was that it took itself WAY too serious.

Even the music feels more cartoonish. The sharp break in style makes one hesitant to say that Gremlins and Gremlins 2 exist in the same continuity, but Gremlins 2 nevertheless picks up on the original's story, as Billy and the strange creature Gizmo are reunited in New York City. Billy intends to take Gizmo home, but carelessness causes Gizmo to multiply, creating more of the villainous gremlins who spread destruction throughout the building.Gremlins 2 gives more diversity among the gremlins to ensure this film will be sufficiently different from the original; the gremlins are their own characters and some of them mutate further. The comedy is off the wall, and one has to give the movie credit for doing what it set out to do. But in the same way, one can't quite call it a masterpiece because it does not try to be one.

Without Hoyt Axton, this movie proves that his son Billy(Zach Galligan) has wised up. After the passing of his owner, Gizmo, the Mogwai sets out into the world he once saw. After he ventures out he is discovered by two twin assistant scientists of the Clamp company. Billy works there now, and his girlfriend(Phoebe Cates) works there too. The scientists are the ones who breaks the rules of the Mogwai, and the batches they created are way more colorful, and a lot more menacing than Stripe and his crew. The Brain Gremlin(Tony Randall) has a lot more class. Then you have a Gargoyle Gremlin, the Arachnid(Spider) Gremlin, the Electro-Gremlin, and goofy-one, and the every voluptuous Lady Gremlin. I like the part where Billy's assistant, and his girlfriend got trapped by the Spider-Gremlin, and Gizmo gets Rambo on it. He was pushed too far. And it took a lot of teamwork to stop those horrendous creatures. But the real humorous part is where the Gremlins put up a little porn which riles wrestler Hulk Hogan. At least no one should set him off. This movie has a lot more humor than horror, and it was a little wild in the middle, but other than that, it was a lot of fun to see. Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!

Billy discovers that Gizmo is being held in a genetics lab in the building and rescues him but inevitably disaster strikes and soon an army of gremlins are rampaging through the building, waiting for nightfall so they can do some good old New York sightseeing. Can Billy and his friends stop them ?This hilarious sequel doesn't really work as a dramatic movie because it sort of breaks down about halfway through into a series of completely insane scenes (like Nightbreed or Weekend). However, if you can get past that, it is one of the most gloriously satirical, goofy, eye-popping, self-deprecating, completely nutty films ever made. Dante was given a blank cheque by Warner Brothers to make a sequel and he, producer Mike Finnell and writer Charlie Haas created the closest thing to a live action cartoon, in which they take adolescent potshots at anything that sprung to mind. Its chief target is corporate big business (the Clamp building is a disaster zone where nothing works even before the gremlins start destroying it and the employees are treated like cattle) but cable TV, health food, movie sequels and critics (Leonard Maltin gets killed, woohoo !), tacky restaurants, tourism and genetic research (Christopher Lee's lab is called Splice O'Life) are all mercilessly laid into. The special effects, by the great Rick Baker, probably constitute the most amazing puppet-show ever conceived (the only contenders being Jim Henson's movies); Gizmo is incredibly expressive, walks, dances, clambers around and pulls off whole dramatic scenes by himself, and we have hundreds of standard gremlins, plus a Mohawk gremlin, a Brain gremlin, a Gargoyle gremlin, an Electric gremlin, a Giant Spider gremlin, all of whom are simply stunning. The scale of the effects work is just dazzling, as is James Spencer's incredible production design work on the Clamp building, which is alternately inspiring and horrifying, and there is a great little cartoon by Chuck Jones which bookends the movie. The large cast are adorable - no movie stars, just funny, talented actors giving their all in the face of the craziness. Galligan and Cates are great again (don't miss the bit where she spoofs her Why I Hate Christmas speech from the original), Prosky is sensational as Grandpa Fred, the caped horror-host with more serious journalistic aspirations, wild-looking orange-haired Morris gives probably the definitive yuppie performance of the era, Glover has a lot of fun playing the Donald Trump caricature as an aw-shucks Big Kid, Lee is truly wonderful as the much put-upon Dr Catheter, Picardo suffers even more indignities than usual in one of Dante's films, Keye Luke, Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph all reprise their roles from the original, and there are a whole host of great bit players, notably John Astin, Belinda Balaski, Paul Bartel, Rick DuCommun, Henry Gibson, Archie Hahn, Hulk Hogan, Kenneth Tobey and even Dante himself, as Grandpa Fred's TV director. I prefaced this review by noting that if you want to watch a regular movie you should avoid this, but it really is unmissable, for one scene in particular, where the gremlins literally break the movie and replace it with a fifties nudie-cutie. This set-piece is, in my opinion, the craziest and most daring gag I've ever seen in a movie. A riot.

What this unfunny but trying sequel, has going for it are some great performances from bit players, Glover, Lee, Miller, and a redheaded cutie, making the moves on Galligan. What we do have too, which I did find repulsively cute, was the female sexed up Gremlin, with much over applied lipstick, who takes a shine, to an arsehole of an employee. Glover's scenes are great though, putting life into his role, a trait this great character actor has, with all his dine work. We have a minor violent moment, which doesn't let us forget what these ugly moguls are capable of. All in all, this is a film, families and older kiddies will enjoy, where for some Gremlin fans, their expectations, might come up a little short.

Basically Mr. Wing (Keye Luke) has died, and his Mogwai, Gizmo, has been captured by the scientific minds inside the genetics lab of a big New York business owned by mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover). Working in the big office of New York are old friends Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates), and when Billy finds out Gizmo is in the building he is keen to take care of him. Kate is very worried knowing what happened last time when they forgot out the three rules, keep him away from bright lights especially sunlight which kills him, don't get him wet or they multiply, and don't feed them after midnight or they transform. Of course, once again these rules are unintentionally broken, and a new batch of Mogwai, soon to become nasty and ugly Gremlins, are set loose to cause chaos in the building. But the bigger problem with this new litter is that they are slurping their way through the various chemicals in the laboratory, giving hem many abilities, including speech, wings, arachnid qualities, and even stuff that stops their allergic reaction to sunlight. Of course as soon as gets dark outside that is when the Gremlins plan to break out into the city, but the humans have a plan to fool them into thinking it is dark, and in the end, they all get electrocuted to death. Also starring Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky as Grandpa Fred, Star Trek Voyager's Robert Picardo as Forster, Howie Mandel as Gizmo, Tony Randall as Brain Gremlin, Sir Christopher Lee as Doctor Catheter, Home Alone 3's Haviland Morris as Marla Bloodstone, Dick Miller as Murray Futterman, Jackie Joseph as Sheila Futterman, Keye Luke as Mr. Wing, Jerry Goldsmith as Yogurt Customer, Leonard Maltin, Police Academy's Bubba Smith and Hulk Hogan. The animatronic and small computer effects for the Gremlin creatures still do reasonably well, I like the fact that the film has in-jokes based on its own predecessor, as well as spoofing many other things, it certainly seems to be more childish, but that's not such a bad thing.

This time, however, the monsters are going to storm a skyscraper, home to an important corporation run by an individual who, at first glance, looks like a caricature of Donald Trump. The unfortunate mogwai, a friendly creature who, unwillingly, gives birth to this plague when it's not treated in accordance with strict safety rules, will therefore try to help humans put them down again.The direction and production crew remains basically the same from the first film and the script remains in Chris Columbus hands. Steven Spielberg continues as executive producer, but definitely is no longer needed his help to sell the film the sweetness of Gizmo and the hilarious tricks of the Gremlins sell for themselves. This film is often labeled a horror comedy, like its predecessor, but I consider it too soft to be horror. Didactic and educational messages from the first film are still present, making it a didactic comedy designed to teach young people. Particularly interesting, however, it's the fact that the monster's target is an impersonal capitalist corporation, similar like many other in our times and more concerned with profits and buildings than human or ethical issues. Is this an implicit morality lesson? Perhaps. See for yourself and gather the family, it's a fun movie and will surely provide many laughs.

But it doesn't just rely on the gremlins for it's comedy, it also has many extremely funny moments in how it does satire of TV and large corporations.

Dick Miller also returns as the neighbor who is still paranoid over the events of the first film so it is convenient that he will have to face his fear and step up. The only real interesting performance is John Glover who steals scenes as Mr. Clamp who tries to do what's best and is responsible for the few laughs available.

Some of the cast from the first movie returns here and all do fine. There are several new people and I didn't have a problem with most of them. The one that bugged me, however, was Haviland Morris. Her performance was pretty weak (that fake accent -- ugh!) and I just couldn't wait for her to get off my screen. As expected, Rick Baker's gremlins are the real star. He goes all out this time and tops the first film with a variety of gremlins doing all kinds of wacky things. 'Wacky' is the word that best describes this movie. Joe Dante lets his inner Looney Tunes fan go wild here. That won't appeal to everybody. Some will love it, some will hate it, some will be in the middle (like me).

OK so maybe not that important but a long time ago, this movie kept me entertained for many a month. Looking at it now, I'm pleased that the anarchic sense of fun remains and it's still a surprisingly solid watch. But the humour has dated somewhat, making it feel older than it is and some of the satirical moments in the picture ended up more like predictions. Don't worry if you haven't seen the first film because it doesn't matter too much - it does spend a long time getting up to speed before the chaos is unleashed.Having moved away from small-town Kingston Falls, young couple Billy (Zach Galligan) and Kate (Phoebe Cates) move to New York and both find jobs working for media mogul Daniel Clamp (John Glover) - Billy as an architect and Kate as a tour guide for Clamp's enormous skyscraper. Meanwhile, cute mogwai Gizmo (voiced by Howie Mandel) is captured by two researchers based in Clamp's building under the sinister leadership of Dr Catheter (Christopher Lee). When Billy discovers Gizmo is in the building, he quickly rescues Gizmo from the genetic scientists and plans to keep him safe before he spawns any more monsters. But fate has other plans and before long, the building is awash with thousands of gremlins which create havoc for the occupants. Can Billy and Kate save the day along with their old neighbour Murray (Dick Miller) before the gremlins escape the building and create chaos in the Big Apple?While nowhere near as dark as the first film, Gremlins 2 The New Batch is considerably more inventive as the different types of gremlin seem to number in the hundreds. There's the brainy, talkative one who appoints himself leader, there's a spider-based one, another who is merged with a bat and has built-in sun-block, a disturbingly feminine one... the list goes on. A pity, then, that we have to wait a while before anything of interest happens. But when it does, the movie kinda goes off the rails in the same way the Clamp building does. Take the moment when it appears the Gremlins have actually interrupted the showing of the film itself, making shadow puppets on the silver screen in front of you, before Hulk Hogan (no less) restores order and the film continues. It must have looked good on paper but it doesn't translate that well. It's as though director Joe Dante couldn't keep a lid on the sheer number of ideas and monsters on screen, letting the imagination get the better of him. Galligan and Cates are every bit the sweetheart couple they should be but credit to Glover for his performance, creating a hideous hybrid of Donald Trump and Ted Turner and playing it for laughs. And that is probably what saves the picture - this time around, the comedy is ramped up while the horror element is reduced to a couple of scary scenes. It is fun without being side-splittingly funny although viewers used to seeing Robert Picardo as the bald holographic doctor in Star Trek Voyager will be amused to see him with a full head of hair.The film's true strength lies with the actual making of it. Seeing the lobby awash with gremlins, swinging from the lights and indulging in a shameless song-and-dance routine is a sight to behold - the mechanics of so many puppets must have been mind-boggling. You really sense that they went to town with what was possible and even these days in the era of near-constant CG, it has an old-school charm to it that I suspect any remake would lack. But Gremlins 2 is an amusing watch that is much smarter than it initially appears, despite the slapstick violence and comic creatures. It knows that it's a sequel and that it is focused solely on making a profit, instead of telling a one-off story. So it designed to be a throwaway movie, entertaining for its duration but not exactly hanging around in the memory once the credits have finished. Part of me wishes a modern Gremlins movie would appear, given how far technology has advanced (and imagine how happy Andy Serkis would be!) but another part of me says no. Once you've gotten the joke, it wears pretty thin after a while and outstays its welcome. My advice? Stick with the first one.

But soon more gremlins are created and run havoc and in the genetic lab the research allows the gremlins new abilities.Gremlins 2 The New Batch is very anarchical film, being very like a live action cartoon and breaks the fourth wall many times. Dante made a very self aware film being surreal with moments like film critic Leonard Martin reviewing the first film, the gremlins interrupting the film and a cameo from Hulk Hogan. Gremlins 2 is also self-referential, such as when Kate is about to tell another sad story of life, but told she hasn't got time to tell it.Gremlins 2 is much lighter in tone to its predecessor, filled with parodies of other films, particularly Rambo 2 and B-Movies. There is also satirise about the controlling, conformist world of this conglomerate, stamping out all individuality and the security team constantly watching for any infringement of their strict rules. The media is attacked and they are constantly jokes in the background, from the failed technology (reminiscent to Billy's dad's failed inventions) and announcements made to the building.Christopher Lee clearly enjoyed his role as the mad scientist who relished his work and gleeful when he has samples of diseases, be very much a B-Movie character he was known for playing. John Glover too was fun as the eccentric billionaire who is enthusiastic and naive and not an evil tycoon.Gremlins 2 The New Batch is a truly meta sequel, a post-modern deconstruction of sequels which had a really bad name at the time of when it was made.

Sadly, it did not, but one gem that's stuck with me ever since Summer 1990 was Gremlins 2 The New Batch.Admittedly, it's silly, sometimes over-the-top and some of the special effects looked cheesy, even back then, and yet&#x85;I had a blast almost double than I had for the original.Sure, I know the 1984 Gremlins original is considered a cult-classic and beloved by many, but since I wouldn't have even seen that movie (see my Gremlins review on why, but suffice to say, my mother warned me it was satanic and I was too young to make my own movie-watching decisions) for a few years following this, I basically grew up with this movie first instead of part one.Also, the comedy &#x96; there was 10x more comedy than the original and actually a lot less horror, had me rolling. The homage scenes and props were great and seemed to be multiplied from the original. Further, I loved the adventure and the grandiose of it all &#x96; I wouldn't have anything to compare it to since I hadn't at this point seen the original, but from the background story, I could piece together that they made this bigger. And finally, of course, I loved Gizmo, but by far, my favorite character and scenes involved Brian Gremlin, voiced incredibly by Tony Randall.Basically, it's a retelling of the original, but in the Big Apple, specifically a Trump-esque building. Gizmo's back and though milder than his inevitable offspring, he's still mischievous and the original, albeit questionable, rules involving this Mogwai creature, are broken again. Hell breaks hilariously loose in the building and our original heroes, who are older, but not surprisingly, look the same as they did when they were teens, have to stop the madness.It's not groundbreaking and not meant to be deep, but it's a helluva ride and has a ton of cameos and side-characters/actors that I loved, like Kathleen Freeman, their television's Microwave Marge, the wonderful John Glover, my personal favorite Star Trek Doctor, Robert Picardo, Christopher Lee and Leonard Maltin's mocking himself and the original movie. Brilliant.While it's good to see the original, do not miss this incredibly fun (and funny) follow-up.* * * Final thoughts Gizmo's still great, with the exception of his bad FX running, and Mohawk, who replaced Stripe as the original movie's evil leader, was good, but this movie belongs to Brain Gremlin.

The reception was mixed at first, but it quickly received positive feedback and became a huge hit at the box office. Since it was so popular, Joe Dante decides to make a sequel six years later at 1990 known as Gremlins 2 The New Batch.The story continues a few years later after the incident where Billy and Kate move to New York by working for Daniel Clamp. Meanwhile, after the owner of the creature named Gizmo dies, Gizmo gets wet by water once again and a new gremlin species is born. So, when they cause trouble this time at the Big Apple, Billy along with some of his old friends from the original try to destroy them once and for all.When it comes to sequels that would either surpass the original or just being plain horrible, this one is a very good sequel, but not nearly as excellent as the first since there are a few flaws that ruined the film for me even when I saw it a few years ago as a child. The story in the first was great and had an excellent mixture of horror and comedy while the story in this sequel was only comedy and slapstick, which makes it much less darker, but not only that. It seems to be at the predictability level and only one or two scenes didn't actually impress me.Flaws aside, there are some redeeming qualities. The acting is great with the main leads having some great chemistry once again and the voice cast for the gremlins is great too. The script has some funny moments and I liked the way they parodied The Wizard of Oz, Marathon Man, and The Phantom of the Opera, which is quite clever. It also has some efficient direction from Joe Dante and the music from Jerry Goldsmith is the epitome of magnificence.Overall, Gremlins 2 The New Batch isn't nearly as excellent as the original, but it is an underrated sequel that it's a shame that this failed at the box office. It's much worth-watching and I think that it'll make you laugh a lot more even for fans of the original. Thumbs up! "},{"Title":"It's A Ten!

(TEMPLE OF DOOM being the exception.) GREMLINS 2 THE NEW BATCH, is a film not made to the specifications of its original. Sure, the same rules apply to the little buggers, but this is a film that amps up the comedy of its premise to an almost Mel Brooksian level, while cutting back on the horror element of its significantly scarier predecessor. A wise decision; once you've seen the Gremlins metamorphose once, it's diminishing returns from there on out. Dante and writer Charlie Haas clearly understand this &#x96; so rather than duplicate beat-for-beat that thing that made them rich the first time, they take a different tack, essentially switching genre, and garnering superior, though less financially lucrative, results. That's called risk-taking. And it's something you don't frequently see in studio film-making.I have some more thoughts on the matter, too...

It's funny, has some interesting Gremlin designs (The spider version of Mohawk is cool looking), great animatronic and puppet effects (they still hold up after nearly 19 years) and one of the most interesting versions of New York, New York ever sung in any film.Of course, the film breaks nearly three quarters of the way, but it's funny to see the gremlins make shadow puppets (especially the Abe Lincoln one- How on Earth did they do that?).

I was unaware there was a sequel until I watched Cinemassacre's (The Angry Video Game Nerd) review of the films. I liked the look of the second film so I bought the film boxset online and watched the films. Gremlins 2 The New Batch is awesome.Everything about it is brilliant. The story, the characters, all the gags and film references and the Gremlins themselves. The filmmakers knew that Gremlins 2 would never beat the original so they made fun of the film itself. Some notable references included an angry parent dragging her child out of the cinema and complaining. A film critic gives a negative review on Gremlins and gets beaten up by the monsters as punishment. There some great film references including Batman, The Wizard of Oz and Rambo.At one point the Gremlins even destroy the film and start making shadow puppets on screen, prompting Hulk Hogan to scare them into fixing the film.The film's plot involves Gizmo, the cute mogwai from the first film, being taken to the Clamp Enterprises in New York after his owner died. Escaping becoming a lab rat with help from his friend Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend Kate, Gizmo ends getting wet and spawns a new batch of Gremlins. The first group consist of grouchy George, bucktoothed Lenny, crazy nutcase Daffy, and Mohawk, a reincarnation of Stripe from the first film. As expected, the Gremlins cause havoc in the building with lots of gags, the Gremlins spawning into dozens of Gremlins when they blow up a microwave and set of a sprinkler system.The building they're in is very modern allowing the Gremlins plenty of opportunities to cause mass destruction and mayhem. There's a genetics laboratory run by Christopher Lee where a group of Gremlins drink serums and gain wacky abilities. One becomes super smart, one grows bat wings, one becomes made of vegetables, one mimics the Phantom of the Opera, another becomes made of electricity and there's even one that becomes a woman Gremlin and flirts with Robert Picardo's character. Mohawk also gains a spider body. The film is really entertaining, but while it lacks the dark atmosphere of the first film, it still has plenty of great moments, some of which are disgusting but fun to watch. Some may consider the film's slapstick humour its downfall, but that doesn't stop them from watching and enjoying this film.If a third film was to be made, it would be interesting to see what the Gremlins could mess with in the 21st Century.

There is a tidal wave of movie in-jokes, from the classics to even the first Gremlins. You'll more than likely laugh at a new joke you didn't notice before every single time you see it 3. Christopher Lee hamming it up in another B Movie is too good to resist.So when you watch this movie, don't expect to be scared.

"},{"Title":"Off the wall and completely out there","Date":"8 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" As sequels go, Gremlins 2 The New Batch is quite inventive and darkly original. Qualities you don't usually find in the standard sequel. But it also has traits you find in nearly every sequel. Its the same sort of story recycled over again.Gremlins 2 is not a straight rehash of its predecessor, the 1984 classic. It has a few innovations and changes the setting from a sleepy all-American town to a New York high rise. But it never quite surmounts the fact that it follows very similar paths to Gremlins.Joe Dante is back in the directors chair, and with this film, his wacky imagination has really been let off its leash. Although Steven Spielberg produced Gremlins 1&2, I get the impression his influence here is a little less pronounced. He probably restrained Dante last time so things didn't get too dark. But here, Dante's been given a larger budget, a whole new set of special effects to play with, and a gleefully irreverent screenplay to sink his teeth into. The result is a fast, frantic and even more anarchic Gremlins picture.We all know how the Gremlins are created. Through the cute, cuddly Mogwai Gizmo. If he gets wet, he breeds them. And if they eat after midnight, they turn from cute and furry to green and scary. And that's what happens here.This time, the action has been transplanted from sugary Kingston Falls to the shiny Clamp Tower, a gigantic skyscraper with God knows how many floors. This is a building that represents everything wrong with the world. Everything here is automated, from lifts and climate control right down to the self-cleaning ashtrays on many an executive's desk. A place ripe for demolishing.Dante clearly gets a great deal of fun and enjoyment from gradually tearing this faceless figurehead of American capitalism down one cliché at a time. And while the film is fun, it is ultimately hollow.Gremlins was a better film because for me, there was something genuinely magical about it. The special effects were really quite superb for 1984 and they still hold up remarkably well today. There came a time when you forgot you were watching what was really a bunch of puppets running riot. They seemed like living beings to me.But Gremlins 2, while maybe more technically proficient, is just a bit too much. Dante can certainly be commended for trying out new things. But there comes a time when the invention keeps building and building until it loses all sense of a reality check.I'll give you an example. Dante is known for breaking down the fourth wall in his films. This technique was incorporated with more subtlety in Pt 1, like a Gremlin using a hand-puppet (a puppet using a puppet), or tearing through a cinema screen, but Gremlins 2 takes the approach just a step too far. Here we have Gremlins stopping the film at the halfway point, and resorting to Hulk Hogan to straighten things out. It's a technique that's trying to be too clever for its own good.Dante is also known for breezy, fast-paced direction. Sometimes at the expense of plot. And in Gremlins 2 its particularly noticeable. It all begins with a thin semblance of plot, but once the Gremlins take over, the film splinters off into a number of setpieces with no real focus or structure. Some are quite hilarious, like their rendition of New York, New York. And I liked the scenes with the Brain Gremlin, a Gremlin who drinks a gene-enhanced formula in the building's genetics lab and turns into a chatty, pint-sized motivational speaker.But other scenes with a Spider Gremlin, a Bat Gremlin and a Vegetable Gremlin seem to be there just for arguments sake. There's certainly a fair degree of imagination on display, but its a cocktail that seems just a bit too rich at times.Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are back on hand. But they only really walk around the set trying to figure out how they plug into all this. There's quite a wonderful supporting cast though. John Glover turns in an hilarious performance as Daniel Clamp, the Donald Trump/Ted Turner media mogul who watches aghast as his corporate empire goes down in flames. His performance is an amusing flip-side to his more sinister, ruthless character Lionel Luthor in Smallville.Robert Prosky does a nicely warm performance as Grandpa Fred, a failed late night creature-feature host. He's dressed up as Dracula for the whole running time, but even buried under makeup, his warmth shines through. And Christopher Lee is perfectly sinister as Dr Catheter, the mad scientist who mixes up genetic cocktails the Gremlins keep drinking.I also liked Haviland Morris' fast-talking chain-smoking department head. Even though she's given criminally little to do. And Dante regular Dick Miller is back to get revenge on the Gremlins who shattered his life.There are too many individual Gremlin sequences to mention in one review. Its best just to let the film carry you on the wacky roller-coaster ride it wants to go. Which means tons of in-jokes, special effects and a plot the film occasionally remembers to get back to. It makes for broad satire, and there are gags aplenty. But Gremlins 2 is exhausting at times. Its a fun ride to be sure, but even on rollercoasters, we eventually want them to stop some time.

It was a flick that semi-took itself seriously and semi-didn't. If you loved it for its value as a mild horror movie, then you'll probably be disappointed with its follow-up, seeing as how it pretty much ditches those scares along the wayside and lets the comedic essence run wild and free to its heart's content. But if that's what made the original 'Gremlins' work for you, then you're in for a sequel more than twice as enjoyable as its predecessor. Luckily for me, I happen to belong to the latter group.Six years on from the gremlin rampage that laid waste to the residents of Kingston Falls, and we're back with Billy Peltzer and those fluffy, bat-eared fuzzballs that turn into vindictive little demons if they eat something after midnight. This time round, the bulk of the action takes place in a high-rise New York skyscraper, run by media mogul Daniel Clamp (a thinly-veiled pastiche on Donald Trump) &#150; an impersonal and overly-automated working environment which it's genuinely fun to see the gremlins have their wicked way with. The screenplay has a sharper, more satirical edge than its forerunner, and makes a good start by openly mocking some of the more ridiculous values that the original 'Gremlins' stood for &#150; Billy's co-workers respond with all the appropriate queries that movie left us puzzling over when he tries outlining the three 'Rules' which must be obeyed to prevent a gremlin outbreak (seriously, what would happen if you crossed into a different time zone?). And Billy's reply is satisfying enough &#150; Look, I didn't make the rules, okay? Plot-wise there isn't really a great deal happening here &#150; the gremlins run amok amongst the building's various facilities, while the humans have to get out safely and prevent them from taking their destruction to further afield. I wouldn't even say their various antics are substantial enough to be considered 'sketches' &#150; what this film mainly consists of is a barrage of individual moments, in-jokes and sight gags which last barely a split-second each (blink and you'll miss about a dozen) but which nonetheless keep on coming so thick, fast and consistently that there's always something on screen to keep us entertained. It also makes the movie as a whole extremely rewatchable, as you can almost guarantee that you'll spot several completely new things you missed on previous viewings.Zach Galligan still makes for a rather bland and indistinctive hero, Billy's only real point of strength over most of the other characters being that he's dealt with these creatures before and knows how to handle them. Phoebe Cates, Jackie Joseph and Dick Miller have all returned on form, but it's the fresh set of supporting characters, in the Clamp Corporation's employees, who really put their all into snatching the spotlight from the gremlins. Haviland Morris and Robert Picardo both play their parts with the appropriate levels of energy and exaggeration, John Glover makes Daniel Clamp into a surprisingly likable character by portraying him with a vivid child-like innocence, while Christopher Lee comes very close to stealing every scene that he's in, only just losing out to one freakishly articulate gremlin who wears specs and is voiced by Tony Randall.The puppetry used to render our centrepiece creatures, in both their incarnations, is also a marked improvement over the previous instalment &#150; all the same, their movements may be less jerky and their designs more polished, but the real delight still comes in the knowledge we have that they're puppets. And, instead of trying to make them into convincing, terrifying beings as the original attempted in some of its scenes, it's comfortable to depict them as what they essentially are &#150; depraved, reptilian cousins to the Muppets. They're never scary, and won't have anyone at home screaming as they do the human characters, but they manage to achieve a strong sense of subversive charm in its place that, quite frankly, suits this breed of film much better. Movie monsters were never the same when puppetry became old school and CGI took its place &#150; oh sure, when done right they can look amazingly realistic that way, but they're never as likable and fun. In that sense 'Gremlins 2 the New Batch' was one of the last of its kind, but a perfect swansong for the medium &#150; incredibly silly, but fast-paced, sharply-scripted and gloriously entertaining enough to more than compensate. It comes recommended, especially for anyone who wishes that the rest of the original 'Gremlins' movie could've been more like that wonderful tavern sequence.Grade A- "},{"Title":"Best Film of the Year","Date":"29 December 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Not kidding.

I got to meet Director Joe Dante at the Chicago Film Festival's showing of Gremlins 2 and his incredibly warm film Matinee where he confirmed that he intended Gremlins 2 to be the sequel to end all sequels. The studio required him to make a sequel to the more financially -- but less artistically -- successful Gremlins before it would finance any other films by Dante. The result gives us Tony Randall in his finest role as the intellectual Gremlin and Robert Picardo in his best pre-Star Trek Voyager performance. Christopher Lee wonderfully satirizes his horror film roles of the past as Donald Trump and Ted Turner take it on the chin with John Glovers parody as Daniel Clamp. And who can ever forget the Canadian restaurant scene? Seriously, this is one incredibly entertaining film that requires multiple showings to catch everything that's going on.

It is during his time in the office, that through an accident, Gizmo is exposed to water. With Gremlins on the loose once more, it is upto Billy to stop them before they spread into New York and become unstoppable.Whilst the first of the two Gremlins films was quite dark at times, this second one feels almost like a satire of it's predecessor. This relaxed nature allows it to develop in so many more ways though. By allowing the Gremlins to experiment with Genetics, we are treated to different types of Gremlin (most notably the intelligent Gremlin) who run riot in their own little way.I'm not going to imply that this film deserves critical praise, or that the acting is particularly good. The key to this film (and the Gremlins previous adventure) is to relax and just laugh. It's nothing strenuous, it's just funny. The musical scene in particular driving people to tears of laughter.

It's a shame that only a handful do, but it's better than a bunch of faceless Gremlins like in the previous film (with the exception of Spike).  The brain Gremlin and his song was simply priceless.  Every time I hear `New York New York' I think of little green monsters.  Joe Dante returns along with Galigan, Miller, and Kates, and basically made a movie that had no point other than to poke fun at its predecessor and let the Gremlins out for more playtime.  Knowing they were making a sequel, knowing the rules of sequels, and knowing that no matter what Gremlins 2 was cursed to be labeled as a retread (Gizmo gets wet, spawns evil Mogwai, spawns Gremlins etc etc) they decided to live with it and intentionally go over the top, but seriously folks, after the first rampage what the hell are you coming to #2 for?

Forester announces that Mr. Clamp planned to build an enormous complex where Mr. Wing's shop was and had offered Mr. Wing a generous compensation, which he refused. Some months later, poor Mr. Wing died and destruction of his shop began. Gizmo escaped and was captured by Martin, a lab technician. Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend Kate Beringer have relocated to New York City and work at the Clamp Trade Centre, a large skyscraper that's fully automated. They have voice activated elevators, all the trimmings. Billy works in the design department and is constantly hounded by his supervisor, Marla Bloodstone's criticism. Above Billy's department is the animal research department run by Dr. Catheter. Martin and his clone, Lewis, were technicians there. Gizmo was locked in a cage singing his cooing song. A delivery boy heard it and later whistled it in the design department so Billy crept into the lab later on and brought Gizmo back with him. They were happily reunited.Mr. Clamp himself visited Billy's department that day. Billy luckily hid Gizmo in a drawer. Billy told Kate that Gizmo was back and asked her to take him home that evening and because of what happened last time, she was reluctant but gave in. Later on, water from the drinking fountain sprayed on Gizmo, causing him to shoot out four mischievous copies. Kate mistakes one of them for Gizmo and takes it home where it proceeds to throw food at her. When Billy get's home, he notices this creature was not Gizmo and was about to take him back to the office when who should drop by but their old friends Murray and Sheila Futterman! Back at the building, the gremlins terrorized an ice cream stand right after midnight and devoured much ice cream. UH OH! They then entered the pupal stage. Billy and Kate broke into the building, but Billy was caught and taken to jail. By the time Kate got him out, the cocoons hatched and many hideous, troublemaking gremlins were born. They began terrorizing and hurting poor Gizmo. They also began wreaking all kinds of unimaginable havoc on the whole building. They messed with the computer systems and terrorized shows being filmed for CCN, Clamp Cable Network, like on one such show, Leonard Maltin was trash-talking the movie Gremlins, but when the gremlins attacked him, he changed his rating.Fred, a star of a CCN children's program and a camcorder carrying tourist began to film a news broadcast of all the terror going on within the building. The gremlins found their way into Dr. Catheter's lab. One gremlin drank some brain hormones and began super intelligent and could talk while another drank bat DNA and could fly. He also injected some genetic sun tan so sun wouldn't hurt him. He flew outside and terrorized the Futtermans, but luckily Murray dumped cement on it and it became a permanent statue atop the cathedral. One gremlin injected something that made it become electronic energy that electrocuted Dr. Catheter. It then went into the power lines. One gremlin injected spider DNA and built a web in the hallways that trapped Marla. Meanwhile, Gizmo wasn't going to take this anymore so he began weight training and made himself very Rambo-like. Kate came to Marla's rescue when the spider gremlin closed in on them. Gizmo to the rescue! He fired a flaming arrow at it, killing it. Murray finds his way into the building and joins Billy, Kate and Marla. Billy devises a plan. He turns the hose on all the billions of gremlins now gathered in the lobby, then Kate redirected the phone call from Mr. Clamp's office which the electro-gremlin found its way into, into the lobby which electrocuted all the gremlins. Soon nothing was left but green, steamy goo. Mr. Clamp then saw Billy's picture of Kingston Falls and wanted to build a town like it in New Jersey. He also wanted to do a line of merchandise based on Gizmo.Gremlins 2 was pretty good, though not really as good as the first one. Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates and Dick Miller reprise their roles and though Billy, Kate and Murray think New York City is a strange place, it shouldn't seem that way to them because all three actors were born there. That doesn't surprise me! Anyhoo, I wonder if there will be a Gremlins 3. If so, it would probably be in outer space in the distant future where the gremlins come alive and terrorize space marines. It's bound to happen sooner or later, but anyway, if you saw the first Gremlins and want to see more heinous hijinx from America's most devious little creatures, then I recommend Gremlins 2 The New Batch!- "},{"Title":"This New Batch Is Certainly Entertaining","Date":"3 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  It wasn't usual for a hit 1984 movie to spawn a sequel 6 years later but that was the case with 'Gremlins'. However, this film is one of the few sequels that rivals the original in terms of quality. 'Gremlins' was a horror comedy making fun of Suburban households and wreaking havoc on the town. It was a good piece of popcorn fun which elevated above most blockbusters because of it's sheer wit and darkness. The sequel is more played for laughs - In fact, it is almost a spoof of the first film. The final 20 minutes of the film is actually poor Gremlin mania. It has spoofs of everything from 'New York, New York' to Marilyn Monroe (The female Gremlin)to gangster films of the 50's to 'The Wizard of Oz'and so on. The good thing is the film doesn't just remake the first film. This film is totally different but with the same characters returning now ready for the attack. But last time the Gremlins invaded the picture perfect town of Kingston Falls now they plan to invade New York and Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) has until the night to save New York and possibly the world from the Gremlin threat. From the start which features an argument between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck over who should be present for the main logo (Originally, an even funnier extended version of this animated scene was used but later dropped but you can check it out on the great DVD!) which has been specially written and animated by the recently deceased Chuck Jones, we are thrown into the Clamp building ran by Mr. Clamp (John Glover) and which almost completely is operated by special devices saving time, energy and money. This building is the setup for a bunch of great gags and the film succeeds on providing great entertainment but I still can't decide if I prefer this or the first one. It may lean more towards this. Featuring great scenes like the Bat Gremlin, the Smart Gremlin, the Girl Gremlin, the Electric Gremlin who is stuck forever to listen to horrible songs in a telephone and the secretary Gremlin who meets his demise in a shredder. It's the Gremlin's show here and there's no denying it! Chris Columbus' original script with shadows of horror and comedy is now taken over by Charlie Haas, proving the Gremlins can be the star of the show. Joe Dante returns to direct and does a very good job. Familiar faces will be seen in Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller and Keye Luke and new faces in the form of Christopher Lee and a cameo from Hulk Hogan (Or John Wayne, in the home video version).

But of course I forgot all the rules. Don't get them wet, keep them away from bright light and never ever feed them after midnight. So they are back bigger and badder than ever before. My feeling with this film is that you don't take it too seriously and just have some fun, because that is all Gremlins 2 is trying to do, tickle your funny bone.Yesterday it was rural Kingston Falls. Today it's the Big Apple - and lots of wild anarchic comedy - because a new batch of mischievous green meanies is on the loose. Billy and Kate have moved to New York and are reunited with Gizmo, the cute little Magwai. They are also forced to save the day, once again. We told you the rules. You didn't listen. Now you'll have to face up to the consequences. And have a blast doing it. The most impressive part of Gremlins 2 are the Gremlins themselves. They are simply breathtaking. My favourite character would have to be the 'Brain' Gremlin. Some of the quotes he comes out with are hilarious. In his many different situations he is just a comic. I enjoyed it when he recovers from drinking the brain serum, in the brokerage room, the TV interview and when he gets the whole Gremlin gang singing the chorus 'New York, New York'. Out of all the movies I have seen, I would have to say that the 'Brain' Gremlin is my favourite character of all-time. The voiceovers in this Gremlins were outstanding. The most dominant voice in the whole film belongs to Tony Randall, whose talents shine out as the voice of the 'Brain' Gremlin. He did those voiceovers to perfection. He stared in the 70's TV series 'The Odd Couple'. If he wasn't involved in this movie, I believe it would have been a real let down. Other Gremlins that were of great significance for this film include the Salad Gremlin, Electricity Gremlin, Funny Gremlin, Dumb Gremlin and just plain stupid Gremlin. But for truly great special effects, the greatest Gremlin is the Spider Gremlin. When he starts to chase after Kate and Marla in the hallway, it is remarkable to see him walking along and the underneath shots of him. In fact he almost looks real. This leads me to give praise to the special effects team and its leader, Rick Baker. They would have had a huge job and they did it perfectly in this film.  I must admit that the directing and producing of Gremlins 2 would have taken a lot of time and patience. Steven Spielberg and his production team did a hell of a job, as did director Joe Dante. There were some extraordinary scenes and they would have taken a serious amount of directing to get just right. Some of the scenes which standout for me include nearly all the Gremlin shots (eg. scene in the control tower, the abuse with Gizmo and of course the 'Brain' Gremlin who was just superb), with all of them causing havoc in their own wacky kind of way, the scenes in the Hi-Tech Clamp building, the Gizmo scenes are much better, considering that he is given a lot more latitude in this movie.  Voicing Gizmo for the second time is Howie Mandal and he is pretty good as well. Yet one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie would have to be in the TV Kitchen with the somewhat drunk, Microwave Marge.The human cast of this film takes second fiddle to these ugly little monsters. Back in reprising roles are Zach Gilligan and Phoebe Cates. They were great in the first movie and nothing has changed second time around. Also appearing again are Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph as the Futterman's. They were unlucky in the first film and are essential, in my opinion, in the second. I recently saw Dick Miller in the small role he had in the 1984 classic, Terminator. The new cast members in this movie include John Glover, Robert Proskey and Harviland Morris. Glover was exceptional as Daniel Clamp. His silly antics as the boss of a Hi-Tech. office building are very funny. Likewise, Proskey is hilarious as the roving reporter through all the mischief and mayhem (especially in the TV interview with the 'Brain' Gremlin just brilliant). Morris plays Marla, Billy's boss, someone who is very tense, hardworking and a terrible flirt. The story isn't that important in this movie. Ultimately it is about these little green monsters that are inhabiting a Hi-Tech office building in New York City, and having fun doing so. But the most interesting part of this script is the way that this film sends up certain well-known movies and icons. It first of all it pokes fun at the first film (with movie reviewer Leonard Maltin) and then takes off movies such as Batman and Rambo, plus there is a Gremlin version of the famous musical, Phantom of the Opera. In one scene there is a Gremlin playing with Lego, a famous line of children's toy and one who is promoting Warner Brothers themselves. This aspect of the film was truly crazy, but very funny too. Overall Gremlins 2 is a different kind of sequel. By the time it has bagged its predecessor and other known movies, musicals and famous icons, this movie is about to explode. Many sequels are criticised for not being that great. My understanding of a sequel is that it is in some way better than it's original, and I feel that Gremlins 2 fills the criteria. I wouldn't be able understand it, if people don't like the classic sequel, coz it is very original. Gremlins 2, The New Batch - 'Is that civilised? No clearly not, fun but in no sense civilised!'

The first movie, being set in a small town, did not really get too exciting. You don't even need to have seen the first to understand, and the special effects still hold up well after 10 years, unlike other movies of the time. A suggestion for Warner when you get around to putting this film out on DVD, do something new with the break in the middle of the movie.

Gremlins 2 The New Batch is highly enjoyable, even if it very much abandoned the horror atmosphere that helped the first Gremlins movie be lively.Gremlins 2 shifted more to comedy and diminished on horror as reverse to the first Gremlins film. Everyone's favorite character Gizmo is perhaps the main reason why this movie was enjoyable for me to watch. There's even creativity and decoration on the new batch of Gremlins, such as Daffy, Lenny and George (parodying Of Mice and Men), The Electric Gremlin, Mohawk the Spider Gremlin, and best of all, the BRAIN Gremlin, who actually is popular among the fans of this movie. This film seems to have somewhat tapped into the future skyscraper view of the world where people are caught up in the time where the future is focused on advancing civilization's buildings and technology. There is a lot of energy and effort seen in how this movie was produced. Both the human characters, Gizmo, and the Gremlins are all as lively as possible, even improved on as from the 1st movie. Highly enjoyable and a perfect film.

Billy and Kate have left Kingston Falls and now work in the Clamp Tower' a highly automated building in the city of New York. The corporation's next project is a development in China town where, you guessed it; Clamps people get hold of Gizmo and take him to the genetics lab in Clamp Tower. It isn't long before he gets wet and his resultant offspring have a midnight snack and mayhem ensues. To add variety a few of the gremlins go to the genetics lab and drink various concoctions that create new types of gremlins; one is brainy, another can fly and one it turned into electricity! Once again it is up to Billy, Kate and Gizmo to save the day! There may be fewer scares than last time but the increased laugh-out-loud moments make this sequel worth watching. The new types of Gremlins just add to the hilarity; I particularly liked the 'Brain Gremlin' who gave a speech about their desire for civilisation before shooting another gremlin in the face! Other signs or the change of tone include Kate's speech about why she hates Lincoln; in the first film she gives a story about how her father tragically died at Christmas, this time she got flashed of Lincoln's birthday! The change in tone makes this film far more suitable for younger viewers although they probable won't get all the references. Talking of references the film is very self-referential, at one point a critic reviews the first Gremlins film and at another time it looks as if the film has broken down and Hulk Hogan demand that the gremlins in the projection booth restart 'Gremlins 2'.Once again the gremlin effects were great; better than most CGI could achieve today; they may be puppets but they are really there. The acting from the leads was good enough and it was a delight to see veteran horror stay Christopher Lee appearing as the scientist in charge of the lab. Personally I preferred the first film, but it is just a matter of taste; I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first and it has the advantage that it is more suitable for slightly younger viewers.

It's actually more of a corrective remake, with Galligan and Cates trading their generic back-lot small town for the hustle of metropolitan Manhattan, where after a deceptively slow start they're reunited with the cuddly Gizmo (the perfect surrogate child) and his/her malevolent offspring. The resulting mayhem doubles as an attack on consumerism and corporate greed, at the expense of a Donald Trump/Ted Turner clone (John Glover) who is less a villain than an innocent, almost childlike fellow victim. The apocalyptic anarchy will be enough to warm any child's heart, but only adults will appreciate the swift, satirical jabs and constant stream of film references, including a parody of the embarrassing soliloquy by Phoebe Cates in the original.

I think it is more of a comedy than the first film was, the original had plenty of comedy and horror and succeeded in both areas. The plot isn't quite as clever or as wonderfully simple as the one in the original, and one or two moments don't quite work. Still, it is very funny thanks to a good script and efficient direction, and the time just flies by before you even know it. And of course the gremlins steal the show, and boy don't they do it well. They are brilliantly designed, if maybe not as scary, and there is a good voice cast. Tony Randall especially is brilliant as Brain Gremlin. The human actors do a great job, with Zach Galligan more appealing here, he was a tad bland in the original, and Keye Luke is simply great in his reprising role as Mr Wing. Christopher Lee is an exceptional actor, and he also does well as Doctor Catheter. And Jerry Goldsmith's music is again very impressive.

Well, maybe not quite. But this sequel does come close.I initially detested the 1984 film, though seeing it a second time did make me respect it a little more. It's skewed Disney-meets-horror sensibility and sub-Bedford Falls setting is quite literary, and rewarding. The humour is still unfulfilling, however, as it operates at face value. Put simply, an elderly lady crashing through her attic in an electric stairlift is a joke about an elderly lady crashing through her attic in an electric stairlift. In this sequel the jokes have wider, and more irreverent, reference. It even dares to insult the original. Whereas the first took it's time to establish the situation and only really got going in the last forty minutes, the second is a constant stream of gags that begin even before the opening titles. The first is the better film, but Gremlins 2 The New Batch is the better movie.The first real appearance of the Mogwai, Gizmo, sees him jiving to Fats Domino in a delightfully showoffish scene that only exists to brag about how much more advanced the special effects are. Film referencing is the game here, not always subtle, but diverting. Dracula gets several knocks, most obviously the Universal '31 version. Yet Christopher Lee, who played the count in 1958 for Hammer Films, also gets to double take at the bat homages. And is just me, or is the television Grandpa Fred a take-off of Fred Gwynne from The Munsters?64 minutes in and the picture crashes as the Gremlins actually take over the film. Unusually, two versions were shot, the video version and a cinema one with Hulk Hogan, which I didn't get to see. Though this is pleasing as John Wayne telling them to go on back to your own movie is more inspired. Their gunfight with Wayne as he tries to force them out of his film is a nice gimmick, though the makers lacked the guts to allow the Gremlins to shoot him. Still, a nice touch all the same.Leonard Maltin appears as himself, slating the original movie, while the somewhat silly rules of the first are mocked by those that hear them. Another top &#145;84-bashing moment is Phoebes Cates beginning another anecdote about how she was made miserable on a public holiday, to match the original's dad dead on Christmas story. Honey, says Zach Galligan, I really don't think we've got time for this now, y'know? The rest of the cast look on in disapproval.The humour is still perhaps a little too unsophisticated to really engage as satire, but as an option over the first it does extremely well. The idea of a sequel trashing its source is fairly unique, and must be praised. The weirdest thing about the film, though, is the hilarious mock footage clip of the film The Attack of the Octopus People (And boy, is it scary!) It turns out that this ridiculous fake clip is actually a genuine film &#150; 1971's Octaman.

But a director came along that had the courage to challenge this complacency to the corporate life, and to challenge the 1% of America. This director was Joe Dante, and this movie was Gremlins 2 The New Batch.Using a creative satire, Mr. Dante cleverly marketed a brilliant commentary on the political climate of the time and the illusion of happiness which the powers of marketing tell us we are. Dark and sinister, but playful in a way, Gremlins represent the free-thinking part of society, the individuals who want to make their own choices and their own rules. Even the bad guys, the corporate elite, were good guys compared to the Gremlins. Billy and Kate represent the undecided voters, the middle of the road average citizen, the one that WANTS to be the good person, that tries to UNDERSTAND someone or something different, but also fear change. By using the duality of the Mogwai vs the Gremlins, the director poses the most fundamental message put upon the American public...good, or evil? No gray area, one choice defeats the other, a common method of controlling the populace in a politically charged climate.Beginning with the transformation of the Gremlin with the wings, then given the ability to fly in sunlight, then meeting a quick and uneventful death, created the imagery of the government saying, Do not spread your wings. Do not attempt to fly. For five minutes, probably the most beautiful five minutes of its life, this creature experienced true happiness. Until it was torn down from the sky by an old man resistant to change as a herd of people stood around and watched, and did nothing. A Gremlin, trying to be different, trying to be happy, trying to live his life the way he wanted to live it. And murdered for it as soon as he didn't toe the line.Intellegently, Mr. Dante used the happy, white, upper-middle class vs. the dark, boozing, gun toting monsters to illustrate social and racial disparity across America and common, hurtful misconceptions that go along with preconceived notions of what the people across the bridge are like. Can we really condemn the whole Gremlins species because of the acts of a few radicals? I say no.In conclusion, Gremlins 2 The New Batch is a fun and goofy movie for the whole family! The kids will love the costumes and the dance scene at the end was SOOO fun!! Ohhh...and the SPIDER gremlin! Wow! How scary, haha!

As the old man's shop is torn down to make way for a modern development, Gizmo leaves, only to be captured by a scientist and taken to Clamp Tower, headquarters of multi-millionaire Daniel Clamp (John Glover); here, he is handed over to geneticist Doctor Catheter (Christopher Lee), who intends to experiment on the poor thing.Fortunately for Gizmo, the high tech building is also the place of work for Billy and Kate (Zach Galligan and the gorgeous Phoebe Cates), his friends from the first film. Billy rescues his furry pal from his cage, intending to take the little fellow home, but the lovable fur-ball accidentally gets wet (a big no-no when it comes to mogwai), and it's not long before the inevitable pitter patter of scaly, clawed feet can be heard all over Clamp Tower.Featuring an animated intro from Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, a comedy interlude featuring Hulk Hogan, genetically modified gremlins (including bat-gremlin, spider-gremlin, and a brainy gremlin), and even a lavish song-and-dance number, The New Batch is supremely silly stuff, but extremely entertaining nonetheless. The script is witty and inventive (there are tons of in-jokes for film fans), and the superb creature effects (a combination of puppetry, stop-motion animation and animatronics) have a charm that would be sorely lacking if they were to be achieved today using modern CGI technology.Completely demented and packed with laughs, Gremlins 2 is irresistible fun for all the family (well, providing your family has a deliciously twisted sense of humour and aren't offended by cartoon-style violence).

But not before a new batch of vicious Gremlins can be hatched from the poor Mogwai. Smarter, wackier and zanier gremlins. Less of a sequel than a spoof of the first one. While the original did have tongue firmly in cheek, but for the most part kept it's humor subservient to the story. The comedy in this film IS the reason for the story. About as subtle as a kick in the groin. Yet I enjoyed it on it's own merits and didn't overly compare it to the first one. These two films are tho separate creatures indeed. Plus not only was the great Dick Miller back in a somewhat bigger part, but you get a cameo from the Hulkster.

It is so delightfully comical and campy, like a B horror movie, yet delightfully witty and scary. The sequel, Gremlins 2, goes for more laughs than anything else, and comes off simply as an average, one-or-two-time-viewable summer flick.Billy (Zach Galligan) has since moved out of town, along with fiancée Phoebe Cates. They are now in New York City, working at Clamp Industries, headed by Clamp, a spoof on multiple political figures. Anywho. At his new office, Billy finds Gizmo, who has wondered from his home after Mr. Myagi - err, the Chinese man - died in the beginning of the film. He was picked up by some scientists, brought to Clamp, and then escaped to Billy's office, coincidentally. Well, Billy leaves him there for Cates to pick him up later. Unfortunately, Gizmo gets wet, and pretty soon a new breed of Gremlins have taken over the building, including a speaking Gremlin named Brain.Gremlins 2 is in no way as clever, fun, or humorous as the original. What is so ironic is that this sequel was supposed to go strictly for laughs, unlike the original, but I didn't laugh half as many times as I did the first time around while watching Gremlins.The jokes are not exactly re-hashed, but they are very dull. Yes, sometimes there are some big laughs, but I really expected more.Zach Galligan seems a little more full of himself in this sequel. Perhaps after the original he found success and figured he was a big shot. Ironically, he is now voicing computer games, and according to his attitude and comments on the DVD commentary with Joe Dante and cast, he seems to still think a lot of himself.Phoebe Cates is more beautiful in this film. She just looked average in the first, but something about her haircut matching her face in this film makes her look cute.Dick Miller, my favorite character - apart from Stripe - from the first film, returns, saying he was only injured by the snow plow. A cheap way of bringing back a character, yes. But I'm glad he's in it - he has more screen time in this film, and that's one good element of the movie.Director Joe Dante obviously had fun making this sequel, but it's nowhere near as good as the original. I'd probably be blaming the director of this film for how mediocre it is, but I can't muster up enough words to accuse Joe Dante, who made the original, that he is a bad director - the first film was excellent.But part of film critique is that you MUST criticize certain aspects of a lousy film, and while Gremlins 2 was in no way a LOUSY movie, it wasn't exactly a winner.Instead of putting thought into this absent-minded sequel, it seems the filmmakers single-handedly cashed in on the original's solid success. Instead of making something highly intelligent and thoughtful, Gremlins 2 comes out as a half-baked, summer sequel, whereas it could have been remembered as something more.Gremlins 2 is the kind of movie everyone is talking about before seeing it, and no one is talking about the next day.No, it's not horrible, and it's definitely worth seeing - especially if you're a fan of the original - but it's a major blow to the superior original.

You could say that the movies are foremost being aimed toward children, like Joe Dante often does but that doesn't mean the movie is being too childish, like movies of this sort often tend to be.The movie is still actually pretty lame and simplistic but it doesn't take away any of the movie its entertainment value. This time there are more Gremlins than ever, who also cause more crazier and bigger mayhem than ever before.Still you feel that if the movie would had been a little bit more carefully writing with eye for detail and development this could had been a much better movie. The movie is now being pretty simplistic overall and in the way the story progresses. The movie offers little surprises and mostly just relies on the antics of the evil Gremlins.Also the effect could had been more professional. Sure, this is an early '90's movie but some of the effects are simply below par, even for its time. On the other hand some of the effects are done really well, mostly involving the Gremlins of course.It's foremost really a Gremlins movie. The movie features plenty of them and Gizmo is being cute as always. This however also means that pretty much all of the human characters are being put to the background and stand in the shadows of the movie its little monsters. You can blame this on the movie its lazy writing I think, though it of course at the same time is also what makes the movie an highly entertaining one to watch.It's also fun that the movie stars Christopher Lee. It's one of the earlier movies in which he spoofs his own horror image.Joe Dante understands the genre and also knows his classics. Too bad that none of his movies really ever reached the level of greatness, though he has done his share of well known and appreciated movies. He was once considered to be the next Spielberg but this never really pushed through. Still he is a director who knows how to make a movie entertaining to watch, like he also showed with movies such as Innerspace and Small Soldiers for instance.He also often worked with composer Jerry Goldsmith, who with his Gremlins movies scores delivered one of his iconic works.It's a pretty simple and over-the-top crazy movie but its all good fun and entertainment for the entire family!6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Fast Comedy is Rare Example of a Sequel Being Better","Date":"4 October 2011","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Gremlins 2 (1990) *** (out of 4) Billy and Kate (Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates) are now living in New York when they learn that a scientist (Christopher Lee) has Gizmo. Soon they're able to reclaim their friend but not before some of his furry friends are fed after midnight and the green gremlins take over a high-tech building. GREMLINS 2 is a rare example of where the sequel is much better than the original film. The original movie was cute in its own right but I just didn't feel there was enough backbone to the human characters to really make it work. With that said, it might sound hypocritical for me to say that I enjoyed this film so much because the humans for the most part are just an after thought and the gremlins are given full control of the story. Using the word story might not be the wises thing to do because the only thing we really get are a bunch of green guys causing trouble in this building before getting out in the streets of New York. I think the greatest thing going for the film is the way director Joe Dante knows how to make satire and spoof things all around him. In one of the film's highlights, the original movie wasn't overly loved by film critics and in a hilarious cameo the gremlins attack Leonard Maltin who is bashing the first film. Another hilarious bit as the gremlins overtaking a TV cooking show where the attack the host and then go about making their own food. I thought the majority of the gremlin characters were perfectly done and given quite a bit of personality and room to grow. There are many great creatures including one who becomes a genius after drinking some brain fluid and there's another hilarious joke on Lon Chaney's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. The jokes are flying about ten a minute and the film is so wild, frantic and fast-paced that you can't help but feel as if you're head is spinning. That's certainly not a negative thing because the majority of the jokes work very well. The human parts aren't given as much screen time but we do get some funny bits with them. Dick Miller nearly steals the film reprising his role from the first film and we even get nice bits from Jackie Joseph, Robert Prosky and even Keye Luke returns. Lee is perfect as the wacky scientist and both Cates and Galligan are good even if their roles are fairly small. GREMLINS 2 is about as fun as a spoof can get and it's certainly a much better film than the first. "},{"Title":"Disappointing sequel, as sequels so often are. OK at best.","Date":"22 November 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Gremlins 2 The New Batch now sees Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan returning to reprise his role form the original) & his fiancé Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates, another returnee) living in New York City & working in the world's most automated building called Clamp Towers owned by mega rich businessman Daniel Clamp (John Glover). Clamp is planning on building a brand new Chinatown & so needs Mr. Wing's (Keye Luke) shop, Wing refuses to sell but eventually passes away leaving Gizmo the Mogwai all alone as the bulldozers move in. Two genetic scientist's Martin & Lewis (Don & Dan Stanton) discover Gizmo & take him back to their laboratory in Clamp Towers. By a lucky coincidence once there Gizmo is quickly found by Billy who hides him in his desk, however it's not long before Gizmo gets wet & multiplies into mean spirited Mogwai's. These deliberately break the most important rule of not eating after midnight & it's not long before Clamp Towers is overrun with green, slimy mischievous Gremlins. It's up to Billy, Kate, Gizmo & Clamp to save the day...Directed by Joe Dante Gremlins 2 The New Batch was an attempt to recreate the success of the original Gremlins (1984), I have to admit I was disappointed by this sequel. The script by Charlie Hass to it's credit moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring as something always seems to be happening, however this is not enough as Gremlins 2 The New Batch is far more comedy than horror this time around so forget about any sort of story or meaningful character's. Most of the jokes & visual gags are awful, from the annoyingly unfunny opening featuring Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck to the idiotic part where the 'film' breaks & Hulk Hogan sitting in a cinema has to threaten the Gremlins to make them start running it again. Gremlins 2 The New Batch is far more light hearted with no real horror & no one dies apart from Christopher Lee, unfortunately. If you are a fan of films in general then Gremlins 2 The New Batch may provide you with some fun as you try to spot all the in-jokes & references, there are loads of the things like a gremlin in a The Phantom of the Opera (1925) mask playing the organ, the way Doctor Catheter is holding an alien pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), the way Gizmo dresses up like Rambo, a bit obviously inspired by The Wizard of Oz (1939) where a gremlin melts while wearing a witches hat & a musical number straight from New York, New York (1977). All these gags & constant stupid send-ups got on my nerve's after a while as Gremlins 2 The New Batch goes from one gremlin gag to another with little regard for the actual story getting in the way. For what it's worth my favourite bits were the part where the gremlins attack film critic Leonard Maltin for panning the first Gremlins film & a cool bit where a half gremlin/half bat smashes out of a window & leaves the Batman symbol outline behind! Some of the genetic gremlin mutants like Brain & the spider gremlin are also pretty cool. In the end it becomes one long somewhat tedious joke & I much prefer the original.Director Dante forgoes any sort of violence or gore & plays the entire film for laughs. As a whole the film doesn't have any great style.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Gremlins 2 The New Batch is technically excellent as you would expect from a big budget Hollywood film. Despite the absence of CGI the puppet effects are still very impressive & the gremlins themselves are great, music, cinematography & production values are also good. The acting doesn't really matter as none of the human cast matter that much.I was disappointed by Gremlins 2 The New Batch, perhaps I was expecting a slightly darker more horror orientated film but all the stupid jokes & parodies just didn't do anything for me. Having said that it provides sporadic entertainment when it does get something right & it's still definitely worth a watch at least once but it's mainly for kids.

I thought the creatures had a little more personality. And there were more scares and jokes. When the creatures swallow the liquids making them into crazy characters, you just can't stop laughing. I loved the story. Gizzmo is cuter than ever, seriously, he melts your heart. The other characters are even enjoyable as the little creatures. Like I said, as far as sequels go, it's hard to find one that's better than the first. No doubt that if you enjoyed the first one, you'll love the second one.
