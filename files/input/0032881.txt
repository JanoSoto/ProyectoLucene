[{"Title":"Broadway vs. Hollywood","Date":"6 September 2005","Score":"42 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" There have been a lot of irate comments posted here about the change in the ending of the play a character who died on Broadway is almost magically resurrected in the film, and her conversations with the dead are revealed to be a dream.I, too, was in this play in high school--gosh, wasn't everybody?--and I loved the spareness and the emotion of the original. Mostly, I loved the evocation of early-20th century small town life...a life gone by now, and remembered by fewer and fewer people. The original play--and the countless high school or community theatre revivals--took place on a spare stage, but that was perhaps a little too adventurous for Hollywood in 1940. Instead, the brilliant production designer William Cameron Menzies went to work to evoke the actual details of that small town life, and to my mind he succeeded brilliantly. I remember being stopped in my tracks by the tool the milkman uses to apportion out the milk (cream?) to his customers a kind of tubular shovel that allowed him to fill up their own containers and still give an equal amount to all. How on earth did Menzies know about such things? Was it his own memories he drew upon? Some have said that Thornton Wilder might have been horrified by the changes that were wrought in his work. It would be instructive for those people to consult the American Film Institute Catalog for this film. In the notes, the editors remark that no changes were made without Wilder's permission. Further, regarding the fate of Emily, AFI quotes this letter from Wilder to Sam Lesser, the producer, Emily should live....In a movie you see the people so close 'to' that a different relation is established. In the theatre, they are halfway abstraction in an allegory, in the movie they are very concrete. So, insofar as the play is a generalized allegory, she dies-we die-they die; insofar as it's a concrete happening it's not important that she die; it is disproportionately cruel that she die. Let her live--the idea will have been imparted anyway. I hope that will silence the outrage on Wilder's behalf; he seemed pretty happy with it.And I was as well. The important thing to me was the mood that was evoked. I, too, thought that some scenes went on too long--the cemetery segment did seem to drag a bit. But the overall effect is so lovely, so moving.One other thing--for those who feel that both Holden and Scott looked too old for their roles have you ever looked at a high school yearbook from the 1930s or 1940s? I used to look at my parents' yearbooks all the time. Those teenagers looked ancient. There was no culture of youth, no worship of childishness then the way there is today. Their goal was to grow up as soon as possible, and they worked hard all through their adolescence and teenage years. For me, seeing the baby-face of William Holden, looking almost unrecognizably young, the last thing I thought of was whether he looked too *old* for his part! So, regardless of whether you know the stage play or not, you should check out this film. Especially if you love Americana, such as Our Vines Have Tender Grapes or the first State Fair (also with Frank Craven!) or Meet Me in St Louis. Our Town will not disappoint.

Two neighboring families are examined in their everyday lives, and we especially follow George Gibbs (William Holden) and Emily Webb (Martha Scott) as they grow up and marry. A stage convention, the Stage Manager (Frank Craven), acts here as a tour guide and talks directly to the audience and tells them the history of the town and stories about the characters. Independent of time, the Stage Manager can also see into the future and matter-of-factly see the various deaths of several characters as well as their pasts.The scene from the cemetery is chilling yet is quite wondrous as the characters there ponder the timelessness of the universe. Also great is Emily's visit back to her family on her birthday, where she finally understand that life is made up or so many small and insignificant details that we hardly notice as times flies by. The film boasts a terrific cast with Fay Bainter and Beulah Bondi outstanding as the mothers , Thomas Mitchell and Guy Kibbee solid as the fathers. Also notable are Doro Merande as Mrs. Soames, Arthur Allen as the professor, Philip Wood as the organist, Spencer Charters as the constable, Stu Erwin as the milkman, and Ruth Tobey as Rebecca, who gets to tell the mind of god anecdote.The ending is different from the play's but works well in this version.

All I knew is that it won a Pulitzer Prize and was constantly being done by community theatres. Also there are at least FOUR made for TV versions (this is the only theatrical one).  I figured it was time I finally saw it.From what I can gather, this is a heavily edited version (the TV versions run from 2 to 3 hours) and I KNOW the ending was changed (because of the Production Code).  Still I liked it for what it was.  Also I saw a recently restored version so it looks pretty good (considering it's over 60 years old).It's just about life in a small New Hampshire town from 1901 to 1940.  It concerns various characters but mostly centers on Emily Webb (Martha Scott) falling in love with George Gibbs (William Holden).  It also flawlessly recreates a small town in the early 20th century.  Everybody knows everybody else, they all live comfortably with each other, nobody locks their doors at night...combine that with some breath taking production design by William Cameron Menzies and it creates a very comfortable, idyllic feeling.  Also some of the shots of the town at night were just beautiful. A lot of people complain about the total lack of chemistry between Scott and Holden.  They're not wrong but this was Scott's first film and Holden's third (I believe)...they were still young and learning.  As it is, it's incredible to see Holden so young, handsome and full of life.  Scott is very good also and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for this.  They're backed up by a great cast of character actors from he 1930s--basically, nobody is bad.  This didn't move me to tears like others said it did, but it WAS very moving.  I'd like to see the other versions.So, a pretty good view of small town life in the early 20th century.

Its 1901 look shares features with theirs, as do some of its story elements. Everyone knows practically everyone else; and the very fact that such towns are not the sort of place where important thing happens renders what does happen peculiarly intense, as if it had been placed under a magnifying lens in a powerful light. Author Thornton Wilder and his co-writers here adapt what was a most successful and atmospheric play into a deliberately-paced by I suggest an absorbing screenplay. It has the build perhaps of Picnic with the underlying calm of a good early western; only the setting here is Grover Corners, New Hampshire, a decidedly northeastern setting.. Sam Wood directed the film with his usual understated skill; and the writers I believe have retained the best of Mr. Wilder's crisp and often memorable dialogue. The film really divides into three parts--which I would nominate as Introduction, George and Emily and Two Futures(?). George Gibbs and Emily Webb in this film become two of the best remembered characters in U.S. fiction. Sol Lesser produced, with music by Aaron Copland, whose repressed melodies seem to me perfectly to serve this understated masterwork of dramatic construction. Production designer William Cameron Menzies and cinematographer Bert Glennon here tried for an uncompromising atmosphere rather than quaint or merely attractive compositions. Julia Heron did the remarkable interiors, with simple but effective wardrobe by Edward P. Lambert. Among the cast, Martha Scott is wonderfully young and unspoiled, and as Dr. Gibbs, Thomas Mitchell plays with Fay Bainter as his wife more-than-expertly. As their neighbors Editor Webb and his wife, Guy Kibbee is unusually restrained and Beulah Bondi as usual solidly dependable or better in every scene she is given. Stuart Erwin ad Frank Craven (as the stage manager) are quite good, and young William Holden shows to much better advantage than he did in several other films of the period. The supporting cast is not given a great deal to do but they do it very seamlessly, in my opinion. But what one remembers of Our Town I assert is its haunting, almost poetic quality. The production's pace is leisurely without being slow, electrically tense without being excited and focused without becoming too sad. The story here is about life, death, youth, love, honesty and fear--and the narrative evokes these emotions in the viewer honestly I claim because it is never pretentious and never striving for the effect that it admirably earns. It is I argue a touching black-and-white classic; and it is quite well acted also throughout._____________________________________ "},{"Title":"Beautiful and lyrical albeit not what Thornton Wilder intended!","Date":"8 October 1999","Score":"14 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Having first seen this movie as a small child on TV I was amazed at the fact that Emily really did die in the play.

This movie is purely about the poetry behind human trials and tribulations.  It is also a marvelous time capsule that should be shown to any literature class transmitting perfectly the soul of pre-war America. I recommend it as a family movie to all.The rest of this review deals with the other reviewers since it has been made clear by what I have read that the IMDB no spoilers rule strangely does not apply to Our Town.  True, the movie was no more Thornton Wilder's play than Yentl was Isaac Bashevis Singer's short story or Educating Rita was Willy Russell's play or Christine was Steven King's book to name just three which were radically changed to accommodate the director's vision of what a movie based on these materials should say to the moviegoing audience.  King has said words to the effect that, (paraphrasing...) My book is my book.  When I sell my rights to the movie-makers to use my book as a platform for a film, it is precisely that which I do.  The movie is not my book any more than How The West Was Won is history. It is merely the participating artists' vision of the source material.  The late James Michener has voiced similar opinions.Admittedly, others like Gore Vidal have felt damaged when three lines were omitted.  They view their text as sacrosanct.  My suggestion to them is to emulate J. D. Salinger.  If you don't want your work changed, do not sell the rights; a movie is not a book or a play; it is a movie. For what it is worth, I had read the play first, was depressed by it, and was personally surprised, delighted, and enraptured by the lyrical ending which, to me, remained more true to the entire spirit of the movie (a la Sam Wood's Goodbye Mr. Chips -- still one of my all-time favorites, also not 100% true to James Hilton's book)than the original bummer ending would have, since the tone had been lightened and lyricized throughout.  But, this is what artistic expression and interpretation is all about.  Different eyes, minds, and hearts see and interpret the same things differently.  Sam Wood, like Thornton Wilder, was an artist, not a mechanic, as were the other artists involved in the movie.  What lives is their interpretation of the source material to make a movie that is an ode to small-town American life rather than Wilder's essay on the unbearable lightness of being, as it were.

Without any exciting or surprising events, it tells a worthwhile story and leaves an impression on the viewer.Most of the story follows the Gibbs family and the Webb family, neighbors in a small New Hampshire town.  We learn about their lives, loves, and concerns, told in part by a narrator many years after the fact.  Most of the time, things move at a very leisurely pace, with details about the town itself often thrown in.  It's worth watching because of the memorable and effective closing sequence, in which Emily Webb, who has married George Gibbs, finds her life in danger.  The sequence is creatively done, and brings out the importance of the otherwise mundane events we have seen in the rest of the film.The characters are all nicely defined, with most of the cast doing pretty well, especially the character acting in the background roles.  The small-town atmosphere is also convincing.  There's certainly nothing spectacular about the film, but if you are interested simple human drama of everyday life, you should enjoy Our Town.

The belief in this life is almost undermined by the presence of death.There are very dramatic scenes when the Spirit of the Dearly departed now residing on a familiar hillside talk to the young girl ,There is a discussion if you will,which occurs in the supernatural.Moving? you better believe it!It is a terribly gut wrenching emotional purge to look at this with a open heart because it is life we are looking at,the passing of it,the participating in it and the duty we owe to our Father In Heaven to see that those we love our met with honor and dignity when we pass from this world.My Heart goes out to the fine ladies who tended to the cares of there families,timeless,tedious work essential for survival.The fallen find refuge in the merciful pleadings of the Risen Christ.How would one,not want to watch such a dramatic event.However, it is the Eternal resting place that is hammered home,The Eternal, the beginning and the end to everything.I sometime can get so convinced that I go and get someone who I care for and say watch this! Sure enough a little while back after seeing this film with me with discussions and such going on afterwards we always manage to say lets watch it again.This is a very good film,is it intellectual? No not really.Is it God fearing? Yes it is!Without question in my heart those pleadings do not fall on deaf ears.We will be there all of us.It is also the ordinary,that is talked of with a matter of fact approach and we do discover that Grovers Corners has a modest history that predates the Civil War.Is it interesting? yes it is.Where perhaps do you think the wrench in the works come in,for this viewer when the automobile made its presence known in Grovers Corners,New Hampshire.That perhaps provides the idea that I consider part of the problem and that is the advancement of society thru technology.The comment in the film was about all the accidents that were happening and even the Horses were being put out of work.Can you see how we will leave something behind that we really do not want to leave behind.However it seems that the lifespan of a individual was a lot less then,then today.I would recommend this film perhaps as a must see!Why? instead of the drums rolling and the martialist atmosphere we have perhaps one of the truly lovely pieces of music composed by Aaron Copland in the thematic refrain entitled Our Town.I would say this is a do not miss and have your children ask the kind of questions where you will tell them deeply held stories even beliefs of Great Grand Mother and Great Grand Father.This is how we will greet each other in faith,and in Love.I learned and I forgot where I had heard of this film, however it was the music of Aaron Copland that drew my attention,the Our Town refrain stayed with me even unto this very moment in time,it was only through perseverance that at last it was to be available through the advent of the CD and the like.This film is deserving of merit!Very Very fine piece of music,very fine film.

If so, another screen version was just the ticket with Paul Newman now presenting in the role of Stage Manager that Frank Craven created.Frank Craven, Martha Scott, and Doro Merande recreated their stage roles when independent producer Sol Lesser bought the rights to Our Town and filmed it independently for United Artists. The play takes one back to the turn of the last century to Calvin Coolidge rural New England as seen through the eyes of the town druggist who doubles as Stage manager. As he so eloquently puts it nothing much changes in this town, the new immigrants who work in the mill are pretty separate from the Yankee pioneer stock who we look at. Going through the graveyard you see the tombstone names are the same from generation to generation. We're primarily concerned with the Gibbs and Webb families and the budding romance between George Gibbs and Emily Webb. Martha who made her Broadway debut as Emily makes her screen debut also. The fast rising William Holden plays the nice kid George Gibbs and was good in it. So good in fact that he fought that kind of type casting for years until Sunset Boulevard.Unfortunately in this version the ending was radically changed and really did cheapen the production. Thornton Wilder's message about the quiet moments of life holding the most dear memories does not quite come across.One thing that wasn't in Our Town as Wilder wrote it was the explicit gayness of the choirmaster Stinson as played by Philip Wood. It's almost axiomatic that the music in just about any church, organist or choirmaster is usually a gay man. Stinson is gay, no question about it and as the stage manager says, some are not cut out for small town life. It's why he drinks and why he hangs himself, there aren't any kindred spirits for him in tiny Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. Stinson would have appreciated Tobias Wolff's This Boy's Life, he would have known exactly what Jonah Blechman was going through there.If Wilder were writing it post Stonewall, Our Town would have been more explicit on that point. And maybe it will be in future interpretations.

The story is touching, the production values excellent.It's one of the most performed plays even to this day, relating the story of some ordinary townsfolk in a very ordinary place called Grover's Corners, in the early 20th century. The people depicted, of course, represent pretty much, everyone. Its sentimentality seems to have inspired similar stories; notice the parallels to It's a Wonderful Life, for example. This story has a slightly darker outlook than Wonderful Life, however. The movie only takes one liberty on reworking Wilder's original drama, perhaps to soften the blow of an intensely tragic scene. The slight tampering does not detract from the powerfully emotional and pivotal speech by the central character, Emily, however, since her speech precedes the event that is altered. The story's simple yet profound moral is effectively communicated.The director and cast clearly had affection for each and every character, and it shows in the level of humanity brought to these characters, so that you can care about them as real people, as well as their feelings, aspirations, and fates. A beautiful tale, brought to life by a wonderful cast and expert direction. This one is definitely a classic worth seeing.

He's right, too, and it's a pity, because this film production of the classic play is in desperate need of some action.As a play and on the page, Our Town is a challenging mixture of existential angst and cracker-barrel whimsy, taking the age-old question of what it all means and transplanting it to a Norman Rockwell setting. It's hard not to be moved by Thornton Wilder's story; even a high-school production can't help but feel somehow tragic and poignant with teenagers dressing up as old men and women. You can hear those voices from the graveyard Soon enough now...But on screen, the film feels hollow and constricted, very quaint and boring as it zeroes in on the routine goings-on of a rural New Hampshire hamlet as if it were some Homeric epic by way of Frank Capra. I'm sorry, but the romance of George Gibbs and Emily Webb is not exactly exciting stuff. He loves her, she loves him, and they get married. Big deal.The film does some interesting things, narrative tricks taken from the stage. Craven's Stage Manager walks in and out of the scene, narrating the story and telling characters to start talking and be quiet. At one point, he solicits questions from the audience. This all comes off very well on stage, where the physical reality of the performance is not in question. On film, though, it seems an intrusion.The performances are all good, with one glaring exception. Interestingly, the one exception is from the biggest name in the cast, William Holden, who plays George. Ugh! Even in 1940, he looked way too old to play a teenager, and simpers through his big scene in the pharmacy with Emily. His quivering characterization is a distraction throughout the movie, nowhere more unpleasantly then in an early scene when his father upbraids him about not helping Ma chop wood. The way Holden as George breaks down, you'd think Daddy found a crateful of smack under his bed. Holden is so good in other roles; it's a shock how bad he is here Innocence did not become him.Martha Scott does much better as Emily. She's quite beautiful, and plays her more complicated role with a great deal of charm and conviction. The Academy made the right choice nominating her for an Oscar. Yes, she's melodramatic, but that's what the script calls for.There are good scenes and moments throughout the film. One conversation between George and his soon-to-be father-in-law about taking the upper hand in a matrimonial relationship is pretty funny, and there are other moments that qualify as nice. I like one scene between Emily and her mother, right after Emily and George have had one of their halting conversations. The mother, played by Beulah Bondi, is watching them through a window and there's a tiny moment where we can see on her face that she clearly approves of the match, but when Emily comes in with questions about whether she's beautiful, her mother gets quickly flustered and throws up her hands. You're pretty enough for all normal purposes, the lady huffs, and that's that.Great Aaron Copland score, and I don't really mind the change to the ending so much. Wilder himself said that film, being a different medium than the stage, required different handling, and I think he got the central message across just as well. Plus he gave those folks at Dallas an idea about how they could resurrect Bobby Ewing.But Our Town doesn't work for me as a film. Thornton Wilder provided us in the 1940s with a wonderful cinematic examination of small-town life; but that was his collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, the great Shadow Of A Doubt. This doesn't stand the test of time nearly as well. Watch it if you must for Martha Scott, but you're better off seeing it at your local high school.

Because of this, I was somewhat familiar with the story and remember disliking it. However, it seems that this was because instead of watching the play being performed or watching this movie (that was adapted by Wilder for the screen), my class in middle school read the play--the worst possible way to understand and appreciate it. Now, 35 years later, I finally got around to seeing it like it should be seen--and I am glad I did.This is an interesting play because of its cast. In addition to a lot of familiar supporting actors such as Guy Kibbee, Fay Bainter, Beulah Bondi, Thomas Mitchell and Frank Craven (who assisted Wilder with the screenplay), the film marks the debut of Martha Scott and William Holden. I really appreciate how many of the actors are the same folks who starred in the Broadway play and how the studio let Wilder keep control of his script--this, unfortunately, is pretty rare. Too often, a studio buys a play and then completely changes it--showing utter contempt for the actors and playwright.As far as the story goes, it's quite peculiar in style. The closest film I can think of like this is the film version of Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude--but the O'Neill play didn't really work well on screen. Both featured characters speaking their thoughts out loud to the audience--an unusual innovation to say the least. Another innovation in Our Town is having the character of the Mr. Morgan (Craven) also acting as the narrator. Because of this unusual style and the leisurely pace of the film, it's one that might lose viewers who don't have the patience to stick with this one. Don't give up--especially when the film gets depressing--it's a delight and the payoff is definitely worth the long wait.Impressively written, full of wonderful performances and expertly directed, this one is well worth seeing. And, fortunately, since it's in the public domain, it's downloadable from the link on IMDb. Give it a chance--it's a delightful piece of Americana.

I saw it twice, in fact. Until now I have never seen the film adaptation and on the plus side we get Frank Craven reprising the role of his life on screen but against that we also get to see a tangible town which is, of course, the ultimate irony. On stage Wilder was asking audiences to use their imagination and Frank Craven conjured up the town with just a sawhorse and a pair of stepladders. The thing is you can do that in a theatre but by definition film demands concrete images so that at one fell swoop half the magic is dissipated. There are, however, compensations by which I mean the cast and Wilder's deceptively simple poetic writing. Although I could have used a better print I will cherish the one I have.

Given that Thornton Wilder's famous play was a Pulitzer Prize winner, this was surprising.I give the play about a seven on a one-to-ten scale. I've only read it, never seen it performed (it's rarely performed in Australia!), but I've read better. However, I give the film five as it makes even the better parts of the play uninteresting.I simply could not connect with the actors playing the parts. Martha Scott was very dull in her role and didn't do much with her character, Emily. How her performance warranted an Oscar nomination is beyond me, considering great performances such as Vivien Leigh in Waterloo Bridge and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday were overlooked for Scott. Bill Holden, very young here, is almost unrecognizable in his role and looks tentative and nervous. Thomas Mitchell and Beulah Bondi, seasoned supporting performers, probably fare the best.The themes of the play are only mildly interesting in this screen adaptation. Don't get me wrong, I like a nice dose of Americana on film, yet this film does nothing for me. It is lacking in emotion and a genuine small-town feel. The opening narration works well, yet the film goes downhill from there.

The film has the advantage of a wonderful score by Aaron Copland, special effects that cannot be achieved on stage, and other changes that were made with the blessings of Wilder.The story takes place in Grover's Corners, NH--a small town of 2,642--where it feels like things are always the same, but things do change. The viewer is given a guided tour by Mr. Morgan (Frank Craven), proprietor of the town soda shop, who operates both as an integral member of the community and also as an omniscient being who provides a broad overview of Grover's Mill and its history. His point of view, aided by others who help him describe the town, is the most important conceit of the film, allowing the viewer to consider the town and its events from the broadest possible vantage point.Mr. Morgan introduces the main characters--George Gibbs (William Holden) and Emily Webb (Martha Scott)--and their families. They live moderated lives in their conservative town, with big dreams but small aspirations not much different from those of their parents. Mr. Morgan first takes us to 1901 when George and Emily are friendly teenage neighbors. He calls that portion of the presentation Daily Life.Then he shows us 1904 (Love and Marriage). Little has changed in the town, but the milkman now dispenses the milk in bottles. George and Emily are getting married. Their youthful anxieties have been replaced by wedding day cold feet. A flashback shows George and Emily in the soda shop as their relationship changes from friendship to courtship.The final stop is 1913. The milkman has traded his horse for a newfangled car. Emily is having complications in childbirth and her life is in danger. We are shown the town's hilltop graveyard, where those buried there are represented by their ghostly images. Though they are emotionless and quiet, they can communicate. As a new presence there, Emily is more talkative and she sparks a conversation about life and death that is the central theme of the film.Viewers may see similarities with A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life, which would follow in 1946. The viewer, given a broader view of life, is encouraged to not become so mired in the details of daily life that they can't see the bigger picture. It's the same message as Ferris Bueller's Day Off--cherish every day. Appreciate the details as you experience them.Emily--as a ghostly presence--returns to her sixteenth birthday and reevaluates every occurrence with eyes that can now appreciate what she took for granted while living. She laments, It goes so fast and we don't have time to look at one another. Her words are so true. It's a universal observation that connects emotionally with the viewer. The play's message was responsible for it winning the Pulitzer Prize.William Holden is at the start of his career, only one year after his breakout performance in Golden Boy and ten years before the notable films Sunset Boulevard and Born Yesterday. But this is a film of ideas more than personalities.

The stage manager describes the town and the story of the everyday people. There's a stage manager because this is from the Thornton Wilder play. It maintains its playlike narrative. It starts in 1901 and it's a bucolic scene. It's very much a Norman Rockwell existence. George and Emily are neighbors who finds each other endearing. Then she gets married, has kids, lives and dies.The movie delivers life that is very ordinary and very idealized. That's kind of the point. The point is to see a simple life although it does get very slow at times. The big thing is the third act. In the play, she dies and the audience learns to live everyday to the fullest. It's poignancy is somewhat lost by the fact that Emily has to come back to life in the movie. I've never found It's all a dream ever a good idea in a story. This one really strips some of the power from the ending. I wonder if she truly lives everyday to the fullest after the dream. It would be better if the movie tries to center on that point rather than forcing a happy ending.

Editor Webb attended the church where my earliest religious memories took place. And there is Simon Stimson, the town drunk, only none of us would ever have been so rude as to call him that; no one despised him, we all wished there were something we could do to help.What makes this story so profound and earth-shattering is how incredibly ordinary it is. We know these people instinctively, because we all are related. In the final analysis, President Kennedy said in his American University speech in 1963, we are all mortal. We all breathe the same air, drink the same water; we all cherish the future of our children...This production is as self-consciously a movie as the play is self- consciously a play.

Along with Bridge of San Luis Rey. Both, I thought were excellent. There is something about remembering the past, looking at the past, thinking about those who have died, have left our lifes. Goodbye Mr. Chips. Chariots of Fire. To recall two famous works.I have never seen the play on stage. And I don't think this movie adaptation is the best format. I do recall seeing a filmed stage performance that was much better--partly because in the end, Emily dies, and partly because a stage set seems to do so much with minimal props; hence, dialogue becomes emphasized.The stage manager breaking that fourth wall and speaking to the audience would be used by George Burns in his TV program. Some moments of the film seemed to be techniques borrowed from Hitchcock. The Aaron Copeland score didn't overwhelm the drama.Wilder apparently approved of this film ending where Emily lives instead of dying, as in the stage play. That adaptation makes the ending corny. Does it detract from the play? I think it does. The whole point of the play is the mundane becomes profound, creating a connection from one human being to another. We connect when we interact and we interact at mundane moments. Sadly, death is one of those mundane (and profound) moments. And not having Emily die, seems to trivialize the play.There was a line toward the end of the movie. Emily says we interact but don't seem to connect. In this day and age of Facebook, twitter, email, the world wide web--it struck a modern cord--we interact and yet fail to connect.The play works; this move--because Emily doesn't die--fails. Goodbye Mr. Chips works because Mr. Chips and the school boys are all exposed for their frailty. Mr. Chips as a barely competent teacher and the students for being prigs, as all students are. And Mr. Chips works because he survived and endured for what 50 years--and that scope of time adds to the gravitas that became Mr. Chips. (Had he died early in his teaching career--it would be absurdest drama.) Chariots of Fire works because we are looking back from a perspective of the 1970s to the 1920s and memory is emblazoned as the theme of the movie, memory enshrined in trophies and the moral imperative those trophies symbolize.I recommend the movie because it is film adaptation that Thornton Wilder approved. But any filmed stage presentation is better when it adheres to the original Thornton Wilder stage play.

The story covers several different years during the early 20th Century, focusing on the young lovers George and Emily, next-door neighbors, high school sweethearts, and ultimately bride and groom. We learn about each of their families, their neighbors, who will live to a ripe old age, and who will die tragically. We meet the milkman (Stuart Erwin), paper boy, the church organist who has a drinking problem, and the town's genial busybody (Doro Merande) who chats constantly throughout George and Emily's wedding. And when Emily faces her own mortality during childbirth, all of the deceased appear to her to take her through a journey to prepare either for life or death as she questions her existence. All of this happens as progress happens throughout life in Grover's Corners, daily details of even the most minor things (how the milkman delivers his goods, for example) in life. The audience comes to realize that life is never static, that change is constant, that towns will change along with the generations of the families who either stay or move away, but as long as people continue to be able to love, there will always be hope. Craven, in his best performance, is the heart and soul of the story, both through his narration and brief interaction with the young couple as they sip away at strawberry sodas in his drug store. As the mothers, Fay Bainter and Beulah Bondi offer touching performances. They seem almost mystic through the dark photography that seems to dimmer as the film moves on. Thomas Mitchell and Guy Kibbee are their husbands, quietly wise yet human. Stuart Erwin is amusing as the milkman, and hatchet faced Doro Merande as the gleeful Mrs. Soames is memorable as well. People tend to confuse her with The Wizard of Oz's Margaret Hamilton, but her voice is much higher pitched than Ms. Hamilton's. (Ironically, Hamilton would play that part in a 1968 Broadway revival.) Probably more revived than any other Broadway play, Our Town is a touching reminder that we can't go back, we can't change destiny, and that our past is a reflection of what we have become.

I do love the sets, and the scope of showing the town, but the best thing about the original three-act play is that the play is performed without a set and the actors mime their actions without the use of props. Author, Thornton Wilder once said Our claim, our hope, our despair are in the mind &#x96; not in things, not in 'scenery.' Throughout the play, Wilder uses meta-theatrical devices, such as narration by a stage manager who tells them what they are seeing. Still, it's for the audience to use their imagination vision to put it in motion. In this movie, it's more set in stone, what the producers want us to see. Set in the fictional American small town of Grover's Corners, it tells the story of an average town's citizens in the early twentieth century as depicted through their everyday lives. Scenes from the town's history between the years of 1901 and 1913 are performed. The film mostly focus this same three act format. Act I Daily Life introduces the audience to the people living in Grover's Corners in 1901. There is a lot of filler scenes about minor characters that play no big part in the main plot. Honestly who cares about the newspaper boy and milk man? The only characters, the film should focus on, is the Webb and Gibbs households. William Holden and Martha Scott are pretty typecast as George Gibbs and Martha Scott. They are too old to play teenagers, and the dialogue between them is wooden and dull. The movie is a bit boring, watching somebody mundane life that you're asking yourself. What is the point of this? I shouldn't be watching this? I'm wasting life, here! I think the only thing that was interesting and tense, was portraying young people prepare to wed. The second act is badly written in both the play, and the film. I don't care that Our Town won Pulitzer Prize; the flashbacks written sucks. It really hurt the already slow pacing being out of order. Once again, you're asking yourself, why am I watching this? Another thing, the movie does is talk about eternity in a lengthy monologue. I like it, but I was hoping a 'show, don't tell'. This movie and play is so tell to the point, it makes us look like clueless idiots. It's really dark story, but it does have a good message in the end. The ending to the film is way different than that of the play. There have been a lot of irate critics about the change in the ending. This part of the film, I think its works. The play has such a cynical ending. In 1946, the Soviet Union prevented a production of Our Town in the Russian sector of occupied Berlin, on the grounds that the drama is too depressing and could inspire a German suicide wave. I think the movie did better to show the message of living each day the fullest message than the play. I have to say the Stage Manager (Frank Craven) was pretty good in this movie, but I have to say, the 2003's remake with Paul Newman is the one worth watching. Even the 1977's version with Hal Halbrooks works a lot better than this. The Stage Manager plays as a God-like symbol. Although Our Town avoids discussion of religion, Wilder hints that a spiritual entity manages human life in much the same way that the Stage Manager dictates the flow of this play. I do like the freedom of breaking the fourth wall with him walking in and out of scenes, asking questions to the audience, and telling characters to shut up. It's rare to see this in 1940's movies and even rare to see it, today films. The movie hasn't aged well. The film is litter with scratches and marks. Even with playing it in my DVD player, I felt like any minute, the film was going to rip apart. One thing that I love about the film is the soundtrack. It's such a beautiful tune that I think the song will outlive the play in future time. In my opinion, Our Town could had been better written, even for the times, its set. Our Town would had shown life between and after the Industry Revolution Turn of the Century, a lot better with putting more immigrations, showing more technology etc. etc. Instead, the town is nearly the same from 1901 to 1913. The film lacks any social community. Despite the townspeople's well-meaning nature, they have only a limited ability or willingness to act or confront societal problems. It really limited the film. It's such a nostalgic archetype that reminds me of any town in America at the time to the point, it doesn't stand out. A mythical place where people are born, grow up, work, fall in love, get married, and die. Characters are archetypes, almost stereotypes, representing time-honored small town American ideals. It was somewhat mirror to a point, that Walt Disney model the design for Main Street USA in Disneyland. Perhaps a political message in itself, Our Town privileges the study of human life and its complexities over blatantly political works that point fingers, stereotype others, and otherwise divide people from one another. If only it focus less on main characters, and more on 'the town', it might had work. This movie should be the case study of society behind human trials and tribulations. Still, it lacks the very thing that makes a community study. Sorry, but our town is not my town.

I understand the film's avowed celebration of small-town values and community, but really the film has no tension points at all to get worked up about. William Holden's dutiful teenage son takes an eternity to talk his girlfriend into accepting a proposal of marriage and Scott's later return from the dead is filled with so much golly-gosh incredulity and winsomeness that you almost couldn't care whether she makes it or not. The acting is all very dutiful and rounded with no-one standing out exceptionally, even Holden, almost unrecognisable as the safe and secure boy next door. I didn't get any sense at all that this was a representation of real-life with almost every character being cardboard-thin and their lives being painfully dull and boring.

I really enjoy this play, and I actually liked the movie. However, the entire movie was not `Our Town' at all. Instead, it was almost a parody of the original play, because it was now a movie and Hollywood must have felt that having a Stage Manager would have not been too realistic. The first two acts are basically intact, with the exception that majority of the wedding material was removed from the movie version. Such little things as George talking with his mother as he experiences `cold feet', the Priest dialogue (a short sample was done by a real priest because there was no Stage Manger, and finally the replacement of the third act with something out of the `Wizard of Oz' and other movies from the era.The entire third act was actually rewritten, and people should get a copy of this movie just to see Thorton Wilder's message about `death' being turned into a joke. Not only was majority of the dialogue rewritten, but certain `dead' characters had different lines. For example, all the Stage Manager dialogue went to Simon Simpston. While the `kitchen' scenes with Emily and Mrs. Web are similar, they too are rewritten, and of course in this version Emily is only having a `near death experience'. Seeing Emily alive after Act III might be heartwarming, but `Our Town' wasn't supposed to be heartwarming. This play was about simple lessons, that this entire movie missed.I would rate this version * ½* just for the fact that Martha Scott was in the original play version in 1938, and it was the first version ever done for the movies.

The way the narrator and other characters address the audience is unique in films, and some of the characterizations, such as that of the alcoholic choirmaster, are disturbing and still seem fresh.  The clear-eyed acknowledgment of death is also unusual for films, though the movie ends in a mushy jumble of metaphysical nonsense.And Martha Scott's performance must be the most lackluster that ever earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination.  Looking very plain and much older than the dishy young William Holden, Scott is completely lifeless and dull.   And though this film's fake reverence for humble, everyday rituals may have had resonance for folks on the eve of WWII, it now seems at once preachy, heavy-handed and pretentious.  Strictly for film fans who can put this picture in its proper prospective in the Hollywood of 1940.

Worse, it's an affront to all of Thornton Wilder's ideas. I'm generally against burning books and art in general. However, if I were Mr. Wilder, I would have encouraged a campaign to incinerate all copies of the film. Let's make a version of Anna Karenina in which she doesn't throw herself onto the tracks, shall we? Or, how about a version of Sentimental Education in which Frederic and Marie get together at the end? If you understand what Wilder was saying in the play, then it's easy to see how truly outrageously bad this movie was. All this is leaving aside the bad acting and over-aged actors (not Mr. Holden's finest hour)!

The acting gives a true feeling of simple life, the characters are portrayed just as they should, and you really feel (as viewer) like you are part of the story. But sometimes, close does not cut it. SPOILERSIf you grew up loving Our Town as it is written and performed on stage, you are out of luck with this movie. This is not because the movie changes the story completely. In fact, it is almost identical to the original story. But I emphasize the word almost. Here is a little piece of information for anyone who has never seen a stage production of it or read the play, but has seen the movie. EMILY DIES!!!!!!!!! It was not a dream!!!!!!!! Hollywood drama infuriates me with this type of stuff. I am glad Thorton Wilder lived to see his masterpiece brought to life, but I can not believe that he was at all happy to see his masterpiece butchered in this one way. I would not be the least bit surprised to find that he sat through the whole movie, and enjoyed all of it until he found that Emily's death was a dream. It is truly a shame because the rest of the film really demonstrated all of Wilder's idea on smalltown and simple minded life. END OF SPOILERIf you are a purist of the play, I do not recommend this film. Otherwise, it is worth seeing for the social commentary. But I say you are better off reading the book or seeing it live. "},{"Title":"A propaganda stunt that fills the screen with a saccharine affair.","Date":"14 December 2007","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Welcome to Our Town, welcome to your town? As we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 America, this three act play is opened before us with the help of The Stage Manager, a visual narrator if you like. After his initial introductions, we are led into the homes of two particular families; The Webb's and the Gibb's.This is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century, and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town. Here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, even if there are, too, the migrant Polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers, they, never get a look-in.Once the daily lives of these families have been introduced; wives cooking, children home-working, fathers working, kids falling in love and the clean picket-fences painted white, the second act is started three years later, after young George (a young and unrecognisable William Holden, then aged 22) and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry. Blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching, too, a turning point in their own lives, from the nest they lived and now, into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step. The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding, it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent, here we see not life, not celebration but death, and it is in this predicament that the dead, as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past, are here to remind us, to tell us, that life, and every last minute, every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered.It is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too, feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on, and by, middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order. This isn't just about Our town, this is moral diction aimed at Our souls and how America can better itself if its peoples', (excluding the Poles, the Irish, the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities', and minorities' in general, plus the supporting backbone of the Americana's who, still, have not had a fair part in this narrative), such as the middle classes, can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest, decent living. The purveyors of the American Dream with special invitation only.I was entertained, slightly, by this movie too, but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting, the musical score or how well, or not, it was made. This was the movies intention to exclude other groups, and to only include the likes of the Webb's and the Gibb's, in the future of the developing country of the USA, a good movie, but also a slightly biased in its stance, I thought.Taken from the play by US' born Thornton Wilder (1897 - 1975) this Pulitzer Prize winning play, and six Academy Award nominated movie, was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes; Life, love and death, the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness. Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness, like other towns, nothing too exciting ever happens here, if anything at all, this town only has the right sort of people, you can still leave your back-door unlocked here, we are seeing the developing lives of these two families, but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves. Our Town may just have been Any Town, just as long as you came from the right part of town that is.

I was disappointed that this film version does not have the original ending from the play. The movie allows Emily to awaken from her childbirth to realize it is all a dream. This ruins, for me, the tension of the plot and trivializes what she and the cemetery residents had to say. I think Thornton Wilder would have objected to this treatment. The TV production with Hal Holbrook was much better and carried the original impact intended by Wilder.

They gave it a 'happy ending' and changed a lot of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharine. The 'stage manager' is quite good, I believe he originated the role, but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40's that is really just posing. The one great feature- the music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth seeking out in a record shop. Overall I think the 1989 Spalding Grey/ Eric Stoltz/ Penelope Miller version is far superior.

I thought the play was very well-written and gave a pretty powerful message. The ending was ironic, ending almost the way it started. Some people didn't like that, but I thought it was pretty unique.After finishing the play, we of course saw the movie version. The movie was not as powerful as the play because it has all of the invisible elements the play has. It would be more powerful if it had used, or well not used, most of its props.Many people on this list commented on the ending of the movie. It was absolutely terrible - ending as if it were all a dream. What message does that send to the audience? Live your life, die, and if you find a moment you want to relive you can go back and wake up again? What's that about? The Wizard Of Oz technique was ill-used.The chemistry between George and Emily was very non-existent. The actors looked uncomfortable filming and not like two neighbors falling in love. The kiss in the wedding scene looked almost painful for the actors.The acting was pretty bad. I don't think the movie was terrible, because I would probably watch it again. It just doesn't have the same powerful effect the play does, Wilder would be horrified. I give it 4 stars our of ten. Just for pity's sake.

This movie is just corny and it's pretty fake and i just didn't buy anything in it. William Holden just looked too old to be a high school student and he didn't have any chemistry with Martha Scott. This movie stars out with a narrator first showing what the town looks like in 1940 and then goes back and shows what's it like to live in the town in 1904. Thomas Mitchell is the town doctor and also William Holden's father. The next door neighbor is the newspaper owner and father of Martha Scott. It keeps going back and forth in time showing Holden and Scott dating, then getting married and then having a baby, but not in that order. I wouldn't even suggest to watch this movie one time.  "}]
