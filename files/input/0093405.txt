I asked to see it - How was I to know? - I was only 6 years old. I think it was being shown at a theater at Universal Studios, and it had been a long, hot day of walking. Hell, I was glad just to be off my feet and out of the sun...that is, until the movie began.I was confused from the start, thinking I must have missed a lot in the first 5 parts. But I thought it's gotta get better, Bill Cosby  wouldn't allow this garbage to be shown to millions of kids like me as entertainment unless there was something funny in it. Then the meat patties - I don't remember much about the movie, I've left the nightmares in my past, but I can still remember how I nearly wretched at this grisly mess of a scene. It was no longer worth being in a comfy theater with AC, it was more like being in agony, trapped by a 6-yr. old kid's optimism that Mr. Huxable would be funny! Never happened. An utter horror of a movie! It ruined a little kid's day, and I'm sure it ruined many others'. When I found out from my folks soon after that Bill Cosby himself had told people not to see it, I was hurt and betrayed. I have since gotten over it, so LP6 is purged from my nightmares, and I applauded Cos for removing this celluloid pollution from our airwaves. Redemption at last.

The film is disjointed, as if the writer quit in the middle. The relationship between Cosby - a master spy living in an enormous house - and his unhappy wife (who lives in the enormous house next door, which is supposed to be a funny circumstance) took time to develop. Then it was immediately lost in some mad-cap chase scenes in a warehouse.There is nothing interesting about this film. There must be a story behind how it got made.

I have a passion for bad movies- B-Movies, exploitation flicks, horror films, you name it- but this movie lacks the impact to even be bad. It's just stupid.How stupid? At the time of the film's release Cosby himself went on TV and asked people NOT to see the movie because it was so bad.

But is it really that terrible? Since it was being shown today on the Black Starz channel, I decided to see for myself. Perhaps it's just misunderstood, or maybe there's untapped camp potential in it, and it's about time I watched the whole thing to find out.The verdict? It's bad, yes, but it's only bad - not offensive, ugly, tasteless or depressing. The premise actually had promise - a retired spy (whose assignments 1-5 were classified in the interest of national security) returns to thwart the plans of a vegetarian madwoman who, with the help of armies of mind-controlled animals, is bent on world domination. But, boy, is the final product a lethargic bore. The movie plays like an experiment to see just how slow an eighty-minute movie can feel; it's badly written and directed, the actors seem lost and lacking in energy, and there's no evidence of even the slightest bit of intelligence on either side of the camera. Is there any reason to see this movie? If you're a MST3K fan, perhaps; there's plenty of dead air to weave your own snide commentary through, and the movie even features Joe Don MITCHELL Baker in a small part. Or maybe you've heard about all the blatant Coca-Cola product placement in the movie, and keeping count of them could provide something for your brain to do. That's what I did, but I counted only three Coke plugs - not a whole lot, granted, but the second sighting was inexcusable. (A full bottle of the Pepsi rival is held in the middle of the frame for an extended shot of meaningless chitchat - it wasn't being sipped from, just held there for no real reason.)What else? Well, the actresses who play Leonard's wife and daughter are quite beautiful, the villianess embodies the appropriate, Cruella de Vil-like dementia that the role requires, and the various animals deployed in the plan - ostriches, zebras, anteaters, frogs, trout and lobsters - are fun (or, rather, they'd be fun in a livelier movie). But what's up with that final scene? Is dumping pasta and cake on your loved one in a fancy restaurant anyone's idea of foreplay? Alas, despite a half-hearted chuckle or two that this movie produces, there's no camp value to be found. LEONARD PART 6 doesn't inspire any venomous hatred like, say, FREDDY GOT FINGERED does - it's more like a bad boring movie along the lines of GLITTER. Whether that's better or worse, I leave you to decide.

Basically Leonard Parker (Razzie winning Bill Cosby) is a former CIA spy who quit the agency following the separation from his wife Allison Parker (Dallas's Pat Colbert) seven years ago, she refuses to speak with him, and his daughter Joan (Dumb and Dumber's Victoria Rowell) is dating a much older man, Leonard is now a restaurateur. The government call Leonard in to be re-recruited for a mission to save the world, many normally friendly animals have been taken captive and hypnotised to becoming killing machines, they have been brainwashed by evil vegetarian Medusa Johnson (Razzie nominated Gloria Foster) who wants to take over the world. While preparing to face Medusa and her army of warped animals and vegetarians, whose only weakness is raw meat, including getting some gadgets and information from his boss Nick Snyderburn (Joe Don Baker), Leonard makes an effort to try and reconnect with his wife over dinner. Leonard is armoured with his special secret agent suit and ready to face the villains, in the end he defeats the many vegetarians, frees the animals and his kidnapped wife, destroys the mind controlling machine, Medusa is defeated and Leonard is finally able to reunite with his wife and get away from the spy world. Also starring Tom Courtenay as Frayn, Moses Gunn as Giorgio Francozzi, David Maier as Man Ray, Grace Zabriskie as Jefferson and Jane Fonda makes a cameo in a spoof of one of her exercise videos. I should add, the title refers to the idea that this is the sixth instalment to a series of films featuring the adventures of Leonard, with the other five parts hidden away for security purposes, and also, when I watched this, it was while Cosby was being accused of sexual assault by various women. Cosby is daft as the secret agent with stupid abilities and skills, and Foster is rather ridiculous as the power-hungry herbivorous bitch, the problem is not just that the film is full of ridiculous moments that are apparently meant to make you laugh, like infiltrating a building while dancing ballet, and escaping an exploding building on an ostrich, the story both ludicrous and boring James Bond, it's just an unfunny and unwatchable comedy.

He actually succeeds at this because I personally can't think of another movie like this one but just because you're different or original doesn't mean your good. Sadly, all the different things here are all terrible so there's nothing to be entertained by. I guess I should also mention that I give Cosby credit for warning people about the film and he even went a step further by buying the television rights so that it couldn't be shown there. I'm really not sure where to start with this thing but there's no question that the entire thing just has a very uneven feel to it and worse of all is that there's not a single laugh to be had. I guess the movie is worth watching at least once so you can say you've seen it and you might even get into a debate about which sequence or scene is the worst. I'm going to have to go for the one where Cosby battles some bad guys by throwing meat on them. As for Cosby, he's incredibly bad here and you have to wonder what type of ego he had to go ahead and say okay to his own screenplay. I'm sure no one around him was being honest by saying this was crap so I guess he just had to see it for himself once it was all filmed.

It wasn't nearly as awful as I'd been led to believe. This is a SPOOF of a spy picture, folks. It's intended to make fun of the James Bond super-spy genre. In other words the amazing escapes and fantastic spy gadgets are supposed to be over-the-top and implausible. And they are, although by not much more than Moonraker.Maybe the gags are a bit too far apart, but not tremendously so. How Leonard takes out the bad guy's lair at the end makes it worth it.No matter what else, Gloria Foster is fabulous as the super-villain-ess.The closest thing to Leonard is Austin Powers. And I'd say it's no worse than Goldmember, without all the gross outs and cheesy sexual innuendo. For my money, I'll take Leonard.

It's up to Leonard to save the world, as only he can battle her Vegetarians and killer animals.It's a bad film by all means, it makes no sense to have three of the stand out scenes of this movie right at the beginning, but they do, and if you really lower your expectations, you will find some strange kitsch gem in this mess.It's not funny, and Cosby is in almost every scene, it's a vanity project for him, someone who was the most famous face on US TV at the time, and his ego told him he could do the same in movie, albeit with a really strange title you won't get unless you see the film, and killer frogs and lobsters.But there is something about this movie, that would make me want to watch it again. It's never boring, I'll give Cosby that, and he is likable in a strange way, it's just that the main story arc of the movie involving the killer animals, pales in comparison to scenes and connotation to his personal life and him trying to get his wife back, which is entertaining.So the main story is pap and dull, save for the Bullfrog scene, and the final third is barking mad beyond belief.

This a wrong and unfunny parody of secret agent films with Bill Cosby playing Leonard, an retired CIA agent that must leave his problems behind when killer animals trained by a criminal mastermind (Gloria Foster, the future Oracle from Matrix) start to kill all CIA agents. Leonard's enemies besides this woman are a rainbow trout, frogs, bees, muscular security guards whose major fears are having pieces of meat thrown on their bodies or face. And this agent à-la James Bond also has some equipments to come in his rescue such as missiles placed on his elbow, helmets, and... Melted Butter (!) which he uses to escape from killing lobsters. And the absurd goes on and on to the point of Cosby's escaping from a certain death by flying on a ostrich (lousy scene, awfully made).I only watched this thing because the review made by Siskel & Ebert, one of the funniest videos on the internet and their funniest review either, was so funny that I needed to see with my own eyes if that really was the worst film of 1987. My advice is go watch their review instead of this film because the review is hilarious, one of those rare times when sarcasm is used with a beautiful efficiency when Ebert quotes about the door scene saying this And you know what he fires at it? The door doesn't go down! How funny! The door is still there! How hilarious! How highly, highly humorous! It always cracks me up!The film gets so ridiculous with its situations trying to be funny but in the end it turns out to be a bad film. They missed audience's laughter with the title Leonard - Part 6 trying to make fun of espionage films who has countless sequels, and people didn't get this joke, always wondering where's the other five films. They don't exist, lucky us who don't have to waste our time on atrocities like this.But I must say, it's not that bad! The only person who cannot be blamed is Tom Courtenay, who plays Leonard's energetic butler and narrator of the story. He seemed to have enjoyed his part while making (that's what I think, maybe he hated to be in the film), seems so natural and he's funny in some scenes, he made the film enjoyable (most memorable scenes are when he's training with Leonard, who is about to meet his wife after seven years separated; and their little jump downstairs). Also, there's some good songs in the film.But the rest of the cast, the direction of Paul Weiland, the team of special effects with those cheap creations, and the story written by Cosby are here to be blamed. They taken from us the wrong and worst kind of laughters, the ones when you realize something ridiculous and bad is in front of you which is not the same kind of laughter a comedy should demand from us, the one when something is really funny, and can makes us happy.

To be fair, I actually liked this film a lot better than the incredibly horrible Ghost Dad (The 2nd film). It is not a perfect film, but it has it's moments.There's a plot by the evil Medusa (Gloria Foster) to control the Bay Area by means of animals. You see a fish attacking a guy in a pool, a group of frogs that somehow manage to lift a car and have it thrown in the bay. Yes, this is for real here. The world needs to be saved, and the government agency in charge knows who can help Leonard Parker (Cosby).Unfortunately, Leonard is retired and doesn't want to get back into the spy game, which has wrecked his marriage to Allison (Pat Colbert),who dumps food on him. Plus, his daughter Joan (Victoria Rowell)is engaged to marry the director of her play. Problem with that is that he is old enough to collect social security. Pulled back into the spy game, Leonard, along with his trusty butler Frayn (Tom Courtenay), tries to stop Medusa from completing her plan.As I said before, this is not a perfect film. It defies logic and common sense (He escapes one situation by riding an ostrich, which jumps off a building!). But the film is so bad that you can't help but laugh at what ends up on screen.

First off, there are no parts one through five, that is just a joke and the one butler character explains the joke at one point by saying that the first five films are of top secret nature, so right off the bat it fails miserably as most people did not get this joke nor find it funny if they did. The film is sort of a spy spoof and for the most part it is a broad spoof in that unlike a film that pokes fun of one particular movie and even follows that film's plot, this one just pokes fun out of a genre and has its on plot. This is usually a good thing, but not in the case of this movie as most of the jokes are terrible with a few exceptions that my disturbed mind found funny and the plot is super terrible revolving around a super agent trying to take on a vegetarian bent on ruling the world or something to that extent it has been a long time since I saw this movie and I did not exactly watch it multiple times as I am sure most people who have seen this film have not.

But, unfortunately it never came. No, there was not even a snicker during the entire film--nothing that was remotely funny in any way. Now I greatly respect Bill Cosby, but his blaming the director for this mess of a film isn't fair--after all, who wrote this film and forgot to include any laughs for an audience older than 10?! It sure wasn't the director! So, at least most of the blame should go to Jonathan Reynolds--he is the writer of record for this film. And who, may you ask, came up with the painfully unfunny story idea? Well, that would be Cosby himself--the same man that appeared EVERYWHERE trashing the film before it even debuted. Now I am NOT defending the movie--it sucked. But considering that it appeared to be, at least in part, Cosby's doing, it sure seemed disingenuous for him to blame the director. Sure, the director sucked, but I doubt if Kurosawa, John Ford, John Hughes or Chaplin could have done anything with this sad script! The idea of the film is that Cosby is a brilliant but retired super-hero. While you may think this film has shades of James Bond, it's much more like a Matt Helm film without all the sex. The Helm films were awful and dumb, but at least they had boobs to buoy the film...so to speak. Here, we just have a painfully unfunny spoof with not a single laugh--and not even sexy babes to distract us from this. What the film had instead were a lot of jokes that fell completely flat and kept lingering (such as the character of 'Nurse') or jokes that were just patently stupid (such as the frog scene, the dancing bad guys or the Alka-Seltzer). And, by the time the film was ready to end, they appeared to have no idea what to do...so they just blew everything up and threw brightly colored foam all over everything. Perhaps this MIGHT have worked as a Nickelodeon-style film--released strictly for kids. But releasing it for a wider audience was a huge mistake.So why, oh why would I want to see this pathetic film? Well, I am a film masochist. While it's true I have seen and reviewed many good films (foreign, independent and must-see films), I also have a soft place in my heart for the worst films. And, I am able to watch a lot of dreck and survive--heck, I saw the director's cut of HEAVEN'S GATE (it's about four hours long...and very, very tedious to say the least). So, among my 7200 films I have so far reviewed (wow, 7200 films--I need to get a life) are several hundred truly awful films. I have seen 41 of the 50 worst films of all-time (according to the seminal Harry Medved book) and a huge chunk of the IMDb bottom 100. I also have tried to watch as many films of the auteurs of bad--Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Hershell Gordon Lewis, Ray Dennis Steckler, Ted Mikels, etc.--so it's a natural that I'd finally get around to LEONARD PART 6. Should it be in the top (bottom?) 100 of films ever made? Perhaps, but probably not--unless there are specific categories and this films one of these categories. Perhaps as a vanity project or worst performance by a former Jello pitch man or perhaps if they are looking for the worst spy spoof. The 50 Worst Movies book lists its worst spy spoof as the Matt Helm film THE AMBUSHERS as the worst of this, but the book came out in 1978. Considering that low budget for THE AMBUSHERS and how Dean Martin just wanted a paycheck and seemed to just walk through the films, I think that LEONARD PART 6 is a worse film. Both have no laughs, but at least the Helm film didn't cost an ungodly fortune to make. So, if they need a worst spy film, I'd be more than willing to consider this my choice for any such list.

Leonard part 6 is truly a masterpiece of the surreal, effectively mixing slapstick comedy and espionage into a celluloid delicacy.  A feast for the eyes and mind, Leonard Part 6 will touch your heart with the relationship between leonard and his daughter, and make even the roughest man misty-eyed with the heartbreaking interaction between The Cos and his estranged wife.  Truly a masterpiece of american cinema, with only Leonard Parts 1-5 being superior.  A Triumph!!

This is a stupid, but very enjoyable spy-spoof that is great to watch when you want to laugh at something that is just ridiculous.

I just watched the end of it.  I have to admit, it is pretty watchable.  My favorite Bill Cosby moments were always when he would get silly, and this has plenty of that.  For a comparison, put this movie next to another notoriously reviled movie Megaforce.  Megaforce has some hilarious moments (motorbikes that launch rockets, and spectacularly laughable special effects) however the rest of the movie is painfully drawn out and could be edited down to about a half hour if they took out what doesn't work.  I would say that in comparison to Megaforce, Leonard Part 6 is veritable tour de force.
