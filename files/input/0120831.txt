It seems to rub some people the wrong way for unclear reasons, but I found it to be touching and hilarious from start to finish. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for Alan Arkin, whom I've always liked, and see on screen all to infrequently. More likely I was impressed by the witty script, deft direction and solid cast. I especially appreciated the spot-on portrayal of Southern California during the mid-70s, which just happens to be the era when I migrated from back East to Los Angeles. Fortunately, we weren't as hapless as the Abramowitz family, who throughout this film are trying desperately to hang onto the ragged edge of the good life.This is one coming of age story that you don't need to be a teenage girl to enjoy.

When I read the tv guide, it said this movie was a comedy. So I tuned in, expecting to not be too excited about the movie. I tuned in about 10 minutes after the start of the movie, and gave the movie my partial attention.  But within 2 or 3 minutes, this movie had my full attention. I could see right away this one was something special. It comes as close to depicting a genuine species of lower middle class family life as I have ever seen.  It is a real gem. And it is not really a true comedy, although it is quite funny sometimes. It sort of defies definition or categorization. Sort of wry and humorous exploration of the dynamics of a typical struggling, lower-middle class family.No fancy camera angles. Not a special effect in sight (and I have enjoyed many movies with fancy camera angles and special effects--I am no snob). But this movie is cinema stripped to its bare essence. Just pure script and acting. And what a script. Marisa Tomei is incredible. She should have won the Oscar for this one.See it!BTW, I cannot believe the lady who scripted and directed this one has not gone on to do more directing or writing!  What a waste of talent!

Actually it's a pretty good coming-of-age story circa 1976. Vivian (Natasha Lyonne) has just grown breasts and now considers herself deformed. Her dad (Alan Arkin) is a divorced man of almost-retirement-age who has never been able to provide a stable home for his kids and keep dragging them from place to place like nomads (and presumably keeping one step ahead of bill collectors). One brother is a struggling actor and the other is too young to really fit in anywhere. In a desperate attempt to make ends meet Arkin takes in his troubled 29 year old niece (Marisa Tomei), charging his rich brother a fee for keeping an eye on her. So they all move into a small, cheap Beverly Hills apartment block and try to cope. Very funny moments... punctuated by some heavy drama and some unexpected twists. One of the better roles that Alan Arkin had had in recent years... proving that he hasn't lost his touch as he's gotten older (unlike many other comic actors of his generation). I have never been much of a fan of Marisa Tomei but I liked her a lot in this movie. The scenes of her and Lyonne conversing in their secret language are priceless!

There was the occasional film like `Rebel Without A Cause' or `The Young Savages,' which certainly explored conflicted individuals, but the focus was not on the `family unit' per se.  Then gradually, all of that began to change; filmmakers evolved and the screen did begin to more accurately reflect the family dynamic in very real terms, for better or worse, and in 1998, `Slums of Beverly Hills,' written and directed by Tamara Jenkins hit the screen, with a depiction of the family unit that's about as honest as it gets.Murray Abromowitz (Alan Arkin) is 65 years old, divorced and raising three kids on his own.  A car salesman, Murray is currently in a `slump.'  In point of fact, however, his whole life has been one long slump.  But he's determined that his children, Ben (David Krumholtz), Vivian (Natasha Lyonne) and Rickey (Eli Marienthal), are going to get a good education, and that means keeping them in the best schools.  And that means living in Beverly Hills.  It's one of the most `upscale' communities in the world, but he doesn't have to be rich to take advantage of the educational opportunities; as long as they live within the city limits, the kids stay enrolled.  It's all a matter of having the right zip code.  But there's the rub; it's just not as easy as it sounds, because even living on the periphery of Beverly Hills cannot be successfully effected without `means,' and `assets' of any kind are decidedly not a part of Murray's personal resume.Which means there has to be a plan.  And Murray's plan is very simple You stay one step ahead of the landlord and the monthly rent and you're home free.  Which means moving.  A lot.  As in slipping out in the middle of the night with only as much as you can carry and moving on to the next `dingbat' apartment.  And so is goes with the Abromowitz family, living a nomadic existence as part of a very real sub-culture in one of the richest areas on the planet.  It's hard, but the kids are getting the education.  Murray, however, suddenly has something else to deal with  Vivian, who is about to enter her freshman year at high school.  And she is not a `little' girl anymore.To tell her semi-autobiographical story, writer/director Jenkins has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engrossing film steeped in nuance and gritty realism.  It's an incisive portrait of how a dysfunctional family can survive by establishing parameters which allow them to get from point A to point B on a daily basis, and what it takes to maintain the kind of internal support system that enables them to function and stay together, though individually their goals and aspirations may be pulling them in opposite directions.  it goes far in disproving the idea that a family in perpetual crisis must necessarily disintegrate.The story is told through the eyes of Vivian, which gives the film a decidedly personal resonance, as it is obvious that this is where Jenkins' heart resides.  And it presents a mature perspective that effectively dispels the stereotypical characterization of the self-absorbed teen mired in the throes of paralyzing angst, which adds considerable credibility to this character driven comedy/drama.  Jenkins also successfully captures an entirely genuine `sense' of the whole Abromowitz's environment; the look, texture and `feel' of the film is a reflection of reality, so much so that you can almost actually detect the scent of the apartments, the steaks cooking at Sizzler or that familiar clean/warm smell of the laundry room. An exceptionally insightful film, it sheds some light on the invisible threads that hold us together and keep the myriad facets of our society connected.What really brings this one to life, though, is the performances Jenkins exacts from her exceptional cast of actors, beginning with Lyonne, who so perfectly embodies the character of Vivian.  This is the pivotal part of the film, and with her `natural' presence Lyonne delivers a convincing portrayal through which she precisely conveys exactly what she's thinking and feeling with a combination of facial expressions, body language and simply the inflection of her voice.As Murray, Arkin gives an extremely affecting and introspective performance, creating a character with whom many in the audience are going to be able to relate and identify on one level or another, as he taps into that sense of not quite being able to figure out how it all works, even after doing it day after day for sixty-five years.  In Murray we see a very accurate reflection of the on-going process of sorting out `life'-- a process that, in reality, never ends.  It's a performance that takes into account the inherent flaws of being human; it makes us realize that none of us are perfect, but that it's okay-- we just have to keep trying.One of the finest character actors in the business, indy favorite Kevin Corrigan turns in an effective, understated and unassuming performance as Eliot, the guy with whom Vivian has a `building thing' relationship.Also giving a memorable performance is Marisa Tomei, as Murray's niece, Rita, who is deliciously tacky and adds some real spice to the film.  Her portrayal is earthy and utterly believable, and like Arkin's Murray, is an honest reflection of how most people grapple with the uncertainties of life.`Slums of Beverly Hills' is a viable exploration of the human condition; a film that helps us understand who we are, and why.

After moving around for most of her life, her family's finally found a place to call home with help from her uncle's money. The catch is that they have to watch after their troubled daughter (Marisa Tomei) and make sure that she makes a transition from drugs to a career worthy of their name.That's not spoiling so much, I don't think, because the movie has much more depth than that. This very original drama/comedy features a great, universal struggle of living without proper means and making life work. It's a coming-of-age film for Lyonne's character who sees the beginnings of her womanhood, struggles of relationships, and maintaining her family's name and reputation through whatever means possible.It's really touching how the Abromowitzes handle themselves and make each others' experiences memorable. The aging father (Alan Arkin) is truly memorable in this film for his struggles in finding out an end to poverty and loneliness without his wife. A great film altogether, not very long (only about 1 hr. 30 min), and easy to watch all the way through. Definitely a buy on DVD (even if the special features aren't all that special).

And in some ways, it is. But, it's so much more than that.(And for the fellas, you do get to see both Marissa Tomei and Natasha Lyonne topless.) It's a story about a family where the mother is the one who left and the kids are actually staying with the father. In the case, the father doesn't necessarily seem all that equipped to handle them. They are an adult and three kids living in one room apartments and moving overnight before they can get kicked out.

Vivian (Lyonne) is a fifteen year old girl trying to cope with the endless cycle of C**P that swirls around her.  Her dad (Arkin) has no job and seems to be an old deadbeat who should have had a good career to retire from.  He's now 65 years old and every three months or so,  uproots his three kids and moves them out of their current slum to go live in another slum,  striving mind you to keep them within the Beverly Hills city limits where the good schools are.  Meanwhile,  Vivian's brother Ben is seems to be following in Pop's footsteps.  And she has her own emotional baggage,  that horrible time that Grandma promised would be wonderful puberty.  Vivian is now learning what Grandma calls the most wonderful time of your life isn't if the truth be told.  Overnight,  Vivian has gone from pancake flat to a C cup,  drawing unwanted stares from every male in sight and snide comments from her disgusting older brother.  When her cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei) gets into trouble with drugs and Rita's dad (Reiner) offers to pay Arkin and family to look after her,  the family is able to afford a more shall we say posh apartment complex.  Vivian meets Eliot (Corrigan) a pot dealer who at first seems to be just another sex-crazed male preying on virgins with well developed breasts but who later proves to be a likeable, almost sweet would be boyfriend to Vivian.  Some may think Vivian to be a crass,  grumpy pouter,  but I remember the bad old days and I was exactly like her.  When have you ever seen an adolescent in a splendid mood with all that bloating and those raging hormones???  And one scene where the dad is leaving for a night out and charging Vivian with taking care of Rita and the boys while he'a away is really sweet.  The little Eskimo kiss shows you how much Viv loves her Pop even though he's majorly messing up on his kids.There are some hilarious scenes in which Viv is introduced to the wonderful world of vibrators,  and one realizes that although puberty is a sucky, awkward,  rotton time,  the discovery of sexuality is in contrast a wonderfully precious and sometimes downright hilarious one.   The movie doesn't really have a focused plot,  but it doesn't really need one.  It's mainly about Vivian and her amazing ability to cope with her abnormal family and her impending unavoidable womanhood,  and as a character,  she's a success.

The lack of budget shows in this way there are no scenes set in a school, just motels and restaurants. The kids may not in fact be stuck in these locations all the time, but the movie makes it seem that they are.The performances, however, are fantastic, and make you wonder why Natasha Lyonne didn't have a bigger career. She is lovable and fantastic and makes you realise Lyonne deserved more than being known as the other girl from American Pie. Tomei is also great, as always, as the free spirited older cousin.I could've done without the embarrassing schlub older brother and the bratty younger one. Broad archetypes only there to show how embarrassing Lyonne's family is.I also did not understand a certain decision she made in regard to another male toward the end of the movie (Kevin Corrigan, as the love interest, is a refreshingly three dimensional character when love interests are usually just clichés in movies like this).

Vivian Abromowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is a teen annoyed at her sudden boob growth. Her father Murray (Alan Arkin) keeps moving the broke family with her, and brothers Ben and Rickey to avoid paying rent. They stay within Beverly Hills limits so the kids attend the better schools. Cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei) has run away from an asylum and uncle Mickey is willing to pay his brother Murray if she could stay with them. Eliot Arenson is the pot-selling neighbor.Natasha Lyonne is wonderfully awkward. There is some good dysfunction in this family but there is also some bad awkwardness.

The daughter, whose biography this more or less is, is the blond and somewhat goofy looking Natasha Lyonne. The deal is that rich Reiner will pay the bills, but poor Arkin's family will have the responsibility of seeing to it that rich Reiner's daughter, Marisa Tomei, who is fresh out of rehab and is due to begin nursing school.That's the set up. Poor but happy Arkin and family must care for screwed up Tomei, at Reiner's expense, in a Beverley Hills apartment in the mid-1970s.It's colorful, amusing, racy, sometimes touching, and constitutes a series of sketches with only a slight framework to hold them together.But mostly it succeeds in what it's trying to do -- provide the audience with a diverting and unchallenging hour and a half. It's like watching one long Jewish joke about family rivalries and the pretensions of the rich.The performances help immeasurably because they're all so fine. I mean everyone, with the possible exception of two or three young boys who don't have much to do except act dumb. Natasha Lyonne is the central figure, not quite cute but nubile, and her expression is generally one of resigned disbelief. Nobody has ever been a better, more bourgeois straight man than Alan Arkin as her Dad. Jessica Walters as a wealthy widow who might consider marrying Arkin as a companion -- that is, chauffeur and major domo, is excellent in a supporting role. Even Rita Moreno, as rich Reiner's girl friend, has that toothy, disdainful middle-class smile down pat.Marisa Tomei does nearly perfectly by the role of the rambunctious, pregnant, ex doper. And she has a splendid figure and brandishes it with brio. (Whew.) But not to worry. Despite the jokes about tampons and menstruation and vibrators and getting your cherry popped, there is only brief nudity, and body doubles are used -- lamentably.I figured it was the usual teen-aged nonsense about how hard it is to grow up -- the pain, the agony, the ontological Angst, nobody understands me -- but it's rather better than that. It has the charm of an old fairy tale.

Some are calling it a cult classic, but I was not quite impressed enough to recommend it to others.Roger Ebert wrote, Lyonne has the film's most important role, and is the key to the comedy. She does a good job of looking incredulous, and there's a lot in her life to be incredulous about. She also has a nice pragmatic approach to sexuality, as in a scene where she consults a plastic surgeon about on-the-spot breast reduction.

The hapless characters are all very likable and often painfully realistic, you side with them immediately even if you barely know them yet. This is mainly because the movie is so well-acted, especially Natasha Lyonne gives a very inspired performance and manages to make even the weaker material work. The dialogues aren't always that great, but the occasional poor line doesn't really affect the gritty realism this movie thrives on so much. It's rough around the edges, and that's probably why people appreciate this to such extent. It also passes by very smoothly, everything gels together well even though there's barely a story to speak of (and whatever story there is never gets resolved anyway).

"},{"Title":"A Generic Coming of Age story.","Date":"10 July 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Slums is a film of decent acting performances in an exceedingly cliche' coming of age film.  The story takes place during the 1970's in Los Angeles.  A mother-less family of near-destitute nomads lead by the father manage to exist by skipping on rent, then finding a new apartment every month or so.  Most of the characters are tedious stereotypes.  The main character is Vivian (Natasha Lyonne); a teenage girl who is curious and insecure about her developing sexuality.  She is a decent actress, but Lyonne gets nothing interesting to work with.  We see Vivian go through all the coming of age experiences we've come to expect  Smoking dope, loss of virginity, etc.  Her brother is a typical drug dealer/user. Rita (Marisa Tomei), a flaky emigrant from the east coast enters the picture somewhat later.Though these characters are played by generally fine actors, they are given nothing interesting to do.  Most of story revolves around Vivian, and the film tries to find humor in her sexual development.  This could have worked, but most of what happens has been used so many times before that it's no longer funny, if it ever was to begin with.  A typical example is a scene with Rita and Vivian that involves Rita's vibrator.  It concludes with both of them lip-synching into it.  What is supposed to be funny comes off as silly and pointless.  Setting the film in the 1970's might have nostalgic appeal for some, but it doesn't help the plot of the film at all.The only interesting element of the film is the father Murray (Alan Arkin).  It's a refreshing switch to see a single father struggling with parenthood.  Arkin plays Murray well, conveying strength and vulnerability in a relatively unique role.  Murray is really the only character we feel anything for.  We might have felt something for Vivian if she didn't appear in such familiar scenes.Slums is one of the few films that I think was more accurately evaluated by the general public than critics.  When it was released, Slums received moderately positive reviews, but completely bombed at the box office.  It isn't one of the worst comedies I've seen, but that's not saying much considering how awful most comedies are.  The only people who might enjoy this are those obsessed with 1970's nostalgia.

Worth watching if you're not otherwise engaged, but don't go out of your way to see it.WARNING &#150; SPOILERS AHEADMany have called this a story of a dysfunctional family. I tend to disagree. True, the parents are divorced &#150; but let's face it, that is very normal in current Western society. Other than this, the family members have a very healthy relationship. They bicker, tease and irritate each other on occasion like all families, but they also love and care deeply for each other.They are dysfunctional in society, not towards each other. They occupy a strata of society which is just beyond the edge of what many consider to be acceptable (or lawful). But the activities that would be beyond the pale in wider society are normal and natural in their own sub-culture.This attitude is realistically depicted in the movie. Thus, the 15-year-old Vivian (the main protagonist) has an on/off boyfriend who is a full-time drug dealer. She is a minor who has sex with this (older) boyfriend because he is available when she decides to lose her virginity. She then leaves him without a backward glance at the end of the film. One brother smokes cannabis. A cousin, Rita (played by Marisa Tomei), has escaped from a clinic treating her for drug addiction. She is pregnant by a deadbeat casual boyfriend with whom she has lost contact. When she tells the boyfriend that she is pregnant he discards her completely. She subsequently attempts suicide. Her uncle (the father of the main character) takes her in partly as a means to extract monetary support from her father (his brother). Rita introduces Vivian (a minor) to her vibrator, and encourages her to borrow and use it. She does so, and this is shown (without any graphic detail) onscreen. Vivian stabs her uncle (with great force) in the thigh with a fork &#150; because he is being verbally unkind to her father during a meal.The movie portrays the sub-culture with sufficient skill that most viewers will treat much of this behaviour as acceptable in the context of the character's lives.The film has no real plot. It is a story of a short but eventful period in the life of the protagonist. This includes her sexual awakening, and a brief time during which her family experiences a taste of a better life (thanks to the money extracted by her father from his brother). Nothing earth-shattering happens, but many will find echoes of their own lives in at least some parts of the story. This, together with the good characterisations and acting, makes the movie a worthwhile experience.I have three main criticisms. They concern plot devices which really contribute nothing to the story. I consider their inclusion unnecessary at best, distracting at worst.First, the script makes a particular point of identifying the family as Jewish. Yet this fact, having been stated, is never made use of in the film. There is no reason they shouldn't be Jewish, of course &#150; but it is puzzling that so much was made of this fact when it was entirely irrelevant to the story.Second, there are (I believe) three close-up breast shots. They are so close-up that only the breasts can be seen, nothing else &#150; not even the neck or stomach. The inclusion of these shots jars with the rest of the film, which makes me wonder whether they were added in post-production to try and `juice-up' the movie. In fact, the effect is detrimental.Third, there is one scene in which the father, when comforting his niece (Rita) after her attempted suicide, commits an incestuous act. Specifically, he `cops a feel' by slipping his hand inside her top as she sits at his feet (she had given him no encouragement, and subsequently objects). This action is so totally out of character with the father's actions in the rest of the movie that it is simply unbelievable. Doubtless the intention was to shock and to intimate that any man, no matter how unlikely, may be a sexual abuser. But the actual effect is to intrude on the viewer's `suspension of disbelief' - this man would not have committed such an act.It also seemed a little pointless to set the movie in 1976 (pointed out by an caption which appears shortly after the opening credits have ended). Granted, the depicted society is such that the movie could not realistically have been set in any previous decade of the twentieth century. But no advantage whatsoever was taken from the chronological setting. Only the cars (VERY few in number), music and the clothes were specific to the era &#150; and all of these things could easily pass unnoticed to a viewer who was not paying full attention. The story could have been told equally well by placing it in the 80's, 90's or 00's. The only explanation for the &#145;70's setting seems to be that the story is supposedly semi-autobiographical. Presumably the writer (who was also the director) grew up in the &#145;70's.These criticisms are quite minor in relation to the rest of the film, which is entertaining in its way. There are some amusing scenes (the vibrator dance for example) but no real laugh-out-loud moments; the enjoyment lies mainly in the drama of these people's lives.This is perhaps more of a woman's movie than a man's, but not excessively so. It's worth giving it a try (unless you are likely to be offended by the sexual content or language). Most will quite enjoy this film. And some, I am sure, will love it.6/10  "},{"Title":"absolutely perfect","Date":"9 December 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This movie is incredibly funny and sarcastic.

Yes, even if there's no organized plot,  even if it's only through the eyes of a 15-year-old. I thought I saw it going somewhere, I think it was, but a couple scenes later I thought I was right back at the beginning again. Here's how it went in my opinion something happens to Vivian, it progresses, it ends; start over, something happens, progresses, ends... you get the idea.I liked the main character, I could even relate to her as a friend would; but it felt more like this could've been a short story or even a sitcom, than a feature-length flick. The characters acted adequately...someone mentioned that the fact that this movie took place in the '70's made it more possible for the filmmakers to make it less PC. The father calling the black busboy Jackson to evoke humor would be for this reason... I think, because Slums took place in the 70's, that it took the cliche coming-of-age crap usually associated with all girl coming-of-age movies and made it seem not as cliche, maybe because the time era tricked viewers into thinking this type of material hadn't been presented in movies yet, if they could imagine themselves enough in this time era.

The thing is, the incest material I think would've worked had it been a different kind of movie, with a bit less intended humor...................  which brings me to my next point.The theory I have on why this movie didn't work as well as it would've liked is that, when there is low-brow humor AND drama, there needs to be the right level of each overall. Though I don't know about specific levels in specific parts, I can sense when the movie has gone too far into drama for its own good. (I don't know about going too far into comedy...I haven't thought about it yet!) Consider, for example (if you've seen it) <The Whole Nine Yards>. This isn't my favorite movie, it's not perfect, but it seems to balance the very low-brow humor with dramatics (such as murder and love) better than Slums. The reason why Nine Yards wasn't better was because it also failed to balance it perfectly.The one movie that I've noticed that can put you in a state of deep earnest and bring you up to the clouds 5 minutes later -aka-THE MOVIE THAT SEEMS TO USE THE ABOVE THEORY AS A BIBLE- is <Rushmore>. This movie doesn't ask that you believe anything incredible just for cheap laughs, but doesn't expect you to tear over something sentimental. You're just happy and sad and happy because of this unknown equation director Wes Anderson has put in the movie. ---I RECOMMEND <RUSHMORE> TO ANYONE!-----Getting back to Slums of Beverly Hills; overall, I think a younger crowd (mostly 14-19 year-old ladies) will enjoy this a lot more than anyone. They haven't seen too much of the coming-of-age situations in movies before, but they will completely relate to it.-Sep "},{"Title":"I really wanted to like this movie","Date":"19 June 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  From the critical acclaim, I expected more from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins.  The story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot.  And I find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity over with.  Maybe I am too young to relate (I was four years old in 1976), but I didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful and I wasn't alive for either of those settings.  The cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience. Overall, Slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, I would say skip this one.

Slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality sans Todd's brand of humor.  The story drags along and each scene is worse than the last.  Maybe I missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience I am glad to be a man.

The film has a decent premise-coming of age within a dysfunctional family.  However, it takes a sharp turn about 30 minutes in, and becomes the usual, lowest common denominator garbage.  This is unfortunate, because I had high hopes for this film.  Alan Arkin delivers a good performance, which happens to be the only upside to this piece.  Marisa Tomei, who was outstanding in 'My Cousin Vinny,' just didn't seem to be the same caliber of actress she once was. 3/10.

It's pretty obviously a first film. Jenkins has created some memorable characters and some good situations, most certainly culled from real-life experiences. But the story arc is pretty weak. The film is at its best when concentrating on its protagonist, Viv, played by the wonderful Natasha Lyonne. She's a great character, the kind that reminds me of how few well developed female characters there are in movies. I also liked Marisa Tomei's character, too, for the same reason. The men are considerably less interesting, and there are almost too many of them. I've never been a fan of Alan Arkin, so it was hard to overcome that prejudice here. He's kind of a despicable character, and it was hard for me to sympathize with Viv's unconditional love for her father. It doesn't help that Jenkins fails to resolve the father character's major transgression in the last part of the film, instead just dismissing it. Jenkins also bombs most of her set-pieces, and a lot of the scenes she tries to end on laughs are duds. And the jaunty score really needed to be dropped. The movie is not nearly as cheerful as the music seems to think it is. Overall, I liked the movie. But I am impressed that Jenkins could create the perfection of The Savages after a sloppy debut and nine years off. That makes her sophomore feature even more impressive.

At least we've come to experience once again what living in the 70s was all about, and it's got some trendy replicas of all things that were psychedelic (like the dome-shaped Pic N' Save store). What else could you ask for? It's a triumphant journey of drive-in movie days that would have no place in the high-tech multiplexes of the present. The terrible direction, the sex jokes, the awfully bland dialogue, the tasteless quality, you name it! But ho-hum! Why does a movie have to be so bad? Like numerous movies of this age, they are designed to cash in on our love for the reincarnation of yesteryear. My words sound appropriate, but otherwise, the slums is where this movie belongs! It's hard to explain how something like this is so horrible that it's a barely passable job to produce. Stay away from this one if you can. As a matter of fact, I will!

In his mid-sixties, wifeless father Murray (Alan Arkin), moves his family from apartment to apartment escaping rent but staying in the Bevery Hills school district for the high standard educational curriculum. His high school son Elliot (Kevin Corrigan), receptive preteen Rickey (Eli Marienthal), and sexually blossoming daughter Vivian (Natasha Lyonne) are in the habit of being awoke early in the morning to move into another low class living space before rental payment is due. 	Tamara Jenkin's wacky comedy introduces this family inventively and comically; at first the characters appear to be original and interesting. Murray and his children create the kind of dysfunction family in the tradition of American Beauty. These characters are mawkish, entertaining and well cast, a potentially effective combination within a farce. Natasha Lyonne, Alan Arkin, and Marisa Tomei perform with curiosity and sarcasm, building on a story that is inspiring. I enjoyed the soundtrack of Slums of Beverly Hills a great deal; the title theme is stimulating and colorful, it conjoins the film's humorous tones. Some of the scenes also produce laughs, but the comic style is drowned in the serious themes dealing with drug use, aging, pot-merchandising, and adolescent confusion. Still, I liked the style of comedy here, probably intended to franchise a sitcom.	Even though Slums of Beverly Hills contains elements of an energetic comic expedition, its characters seem to wander from scene to scene, drifting from one outrageous situation into another with little purpose or motive. The audience has a hard time concerning themselves with such characters simply because the movie hinges them on puppet strings and glides them throughout the uncanny story. The only true revealing variable here is Vivian's sexual exploration, which causes more of a feeling of audacity than involvement. The material in Slums of Beverly Hills belongs in an inconclusive television sitcom, not in a feature full length motion picture that gives birth to more questions than answers.  "}]
