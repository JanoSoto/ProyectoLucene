It seems to me that, for those who hate it, there is too much going on in the scenes. The dialogue is often open ended, and the action is at times frenetic so that the viewer isn't sure where he/she should be focusing attention. That, I submit, is the true beauty of this unusual movie. It has an over the top realism that makes it a rewarding film to watch multiple times. There are so many layers in the dialogue and the acting, so many subtleties between characters, that you can watch it many times and still be noticing something new. This may be billed a comedy, but it is filled with heartbreak and tragedy, betrayal and disappointments. This is not a run of the mill feel good holiday movie. I think those who rate this movie poorly, in some way, miss that. I hope Jodie Foster directs again. She's immensely gifted.

It is a snug little favorite of mine already. I come from a big family (all weirdos) who somehow get along very well. But this story of a bunch of weirdos who do not is just GRAND. Others may say that the themes of family and home and blah blah are the central idea here, but I say it is that Claudia (Hunter, playing our protagonist) has a really wonderful brother (Downey Jr. who nearly steals this film altogether). Brother Tommy comes home for the holidays unexpectedly because he finds out his sister has just had a reaaaaalllly bad day (fired from her job, teen daughter announces she's going to have sex, loses her coat, makes out with her boss, etc) and dealing alone with the family would be unthinkable. He arrives with some hilarious fanfare, and proves to be excellent moral support for Hunter, a distraction for his family, and the provender of an interesting new element....in the person of Leo Fish, who may or may not be Tommy's new partner.Tommy ((heavily embellished and ad-libbed by Downey...listen carefully to his banter...hilarious)ends up taking the inevitable flack for his gayness (probably why he was not going to come home in the first place) but her lets it roll off his back, choosing instead to enjoy his sister's company and his parents' foibles. He also really enjoys (and so do we) watching Claudia and Leo Fish figure each other out. They do...albeit obliquely and elliptically, with the conclusion sort of up in the air (hee hee). But in the process we are treated to Leo's very funky and offhand outlook on life. Listen for his very wry speech about trying to talk golf with his own father....Par Par Bogie Bogie Par Par has become a catchphrase for blah blah blah in my house...Anne Bancroft and Hunter are stellar, and McDermott is darned cute (the  making-out-on-the-doorstep scene is darling). But Downey (yet again) is the one you watch. The director's commentary by Foster gives a clue that he was frustrating to work with, but it seems very worth it here. He is just SO watchable, boistrous, too-energetic, motor-mouthed and loveable. We should all have such a brother. Lucky Claudia.OH! Don't miss the turkey scene.

The sincerity of the script turns out to be one hell of a smash in the head to anyone that can empathize with the basic situations confronted in a typical holiday gathering. Probably the saddest part(and one that most of us who have brothers/sisters will understand) is the sudden knowledge that blood sometimes isn't enough to love somebody. The crackings in fraternal relationships are deeply touching and hard in this one, and  while it is not my case, I think a mother and father will break a few tears too as the going away of children and subsequent cutting of the umbilical chord is depicted as an evident transformation that is usually more painful to the elder than to the young.

All this on top of losing her job and discovering that her sixteen year old daughter is about to begin having sexual relations with her boyfriend. Life sucks sometimes! Unfortunately Holly's character is really the only one the audience is going to be able to relate to, or even stomach for that matter. Anne Bancroft's mom is a nightmare of paranoia, dad (Charles Durning) is a nostalgic, rotund old fool who is quite possibly losing his grip, while sister and brother-in-law (Cynthia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg) are obnoxious and self-centred. Add to this a nutty Aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a totally flaky and intensely irritating homosexual brother (a most unlikeable Robert Downey Jnr.) and you find it very hard to feel sympathy for, get involved with, or laugh at any of this sorry lot.The screenplay swings from drama to comedy to romance to tragedy on many occasions, but Foster is unable to gain effect in any of these modes. In the end neither cast nor crew can pick up the pieces of what was really a misdirected project to begin with.

But so does everyone else in your family.  The small people who were your little brother and sister, the big people who were Mom and Dad - they all grow up and have their own lives, their own families. The world sees you as an adult with children of your own, problems that are real, concerns that completely outside and removed from this group you have known since infancy. Your family sees you as the kid who fought with your sister, and dated the class loser.  And when you congregate, you realize that while your baby shoes don't fit you anymore, you're not sure what does.  Neither does anyone else.Ann Bancroft as the penultimate Mom is a jewel, pulled between her love of her family, her need to support them, her incomprehension of who they have become, and her own strong will.  Robert Downey is fabulous as the manic family clown, not knowing when to stop, not knowing how to protect his closely held secret.  Geraldine Chaplin steals your breath (Literally!) as the dotty maiden aunt who uses her eccentricities as a shield against the disappointments of her life. Her soliloquy is perfect.  Holly Hunter is wonderful as the eldest daughter, her world in tatters around her feet, looking for and not finding comfort within the confines of her family. Cynthia Stevenson is perfect as the angry middle child, left out and feeling betrayed by her oh so much more exciting siblings. Charles  Durning is the father at peace with the world and himself, wondering what all the fuss is about. And Dylan McDermott is the supreme observer, wanting to be part of their lives, looking for a way in to the circle, allowing everyone their dignity, giving them permission to laugh at their absurdities.In spite of all this, or maybe because if it, this film is funny.  It could be your own sister, your own mother.  There is a wondrous joy here, a happiness that family, at least, is predictable.Jodie Foster did an incredible job of showing the humor, drama, poignancy, frustration, love, loathing, fear, and comfort found in families.

The character played by Robert Downey Jr. is a mean, selfish, sadistic, substance abusing jerk. That the Holly Hunter character, his sister, puts up with him at all seems to be a serious case of masochism on her part, not a sign of undying sisterly love as the movie suggests.

Working with an uneven script that is better in its straight dramatic moments than as a comedy, Foster can't get a realistic rhythm going between the disgruntled family members at this Thanksgiving reunion. Every scene involving Geraldine Chaplin as a neurotic aunt is a loss, and Robert Downey, Jr. is awful as the obnoxious gay brother of Holly Hunter. Hunter usually gives flaccid scripts like this a little boost, but even her timing is off (especially in the early introductory scenes, which don't work at all). Finally, as if the clouds parted and clarity shined through, the movie picks up in its final twenty minutes. There's a scathing scene between the sisters (If I met you on the street--if you gave me your number--I'd throw it away) and Charles Durning's remembrance of his family at the airport is wonderfully wistful. I also admired the final arty shots showing the past and the present (with the camera circling madly, joyfully), and then a crystal clear shot of a plane descending into the velvet sky.

We Brits may in recent years have accepted a fully Americanised Halloween, and sometimes even hold our own Fourth of July parties, but we just do not get the concept of Thanksgiving, so Home for the Holidays is frequently shown on British television during the Christmas season. Presumably the TV executives who so schedule it have not actually watched the film; if they had done so they would realise that the word holidays in the title actually refers to Thanksgiving. Claudia Larson is a single mother from Chicago who has just been fired from her job as an art restorer. Her sudden and unexpected loss of her employment, however, does not prevent her from flying to Baltimore to spend Thanksgiving with her parents. On the way she has rather dull conversations with her daughter and with the woman sitting next to her on the plane. When she gets there she has lots of rather dull conversations with her parents and other members of her family. Various arguments break out. Claudia finds a new male admirer. She sneezes a lot. (I think Holly Hunter had a cold). And that's about it.The screenplay was based on a short story by an obscure writer named Chris Radant, and if this film is a fair reflection of the literary merits of his story, then it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Radant has remained in obscurity. This was the second film directed by Jodie Foster (the first was Little Man Tate) and I was certainly surprised that someone of Foster's obvious intelligence and high status in Hollywood couldn't find a more promising literary property to adapt for the screen. Foster has given many great performances as an actress, but as a director she is unable to elicit contributions of a similar quality from her actors, despite the presence in the cast of several big-name stars, including Hunter, Robert Downey Jr., Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. Too many of the actors mumble their words or speak too softly, making the dialogue difficult to follow. As a result the plot is also difficult to follow; for example I was for a long time under the impression that Claudia's gay brother Tommy's friend Leo was also his partner until it finally emerges that Leo is actually straight and his friendship with Tommy purely platonic. Incidentally, Downey's Tommy comes across the most irritating character in the whole film, which is saying something as there is a lot of competition for that particular title. (His nearest rival is Geraldine Chaplin's eccentric Aunt Glady). This would not have mattered if Tommy was supposed to be irritating, but I was left with the impression that, for all his childish antics, Downey, Foster and the scriptwriter actually wanted us to like him.The main problem with Home for the Holidays is that it's just a dull story about dull people, most of whom (Claudia being an exception) are no more likable than they are interesting. It's the sort of film where the wacky, unconventional characters like Tommy and their Aunt Glady are (beneath that facade of wacky unconventionality) just as boring as the conventional ones like Claudia's strait-laced sister Joanne and Joanne's stuffed-shirt banker husband Walter. Even their arguments are not about matters of any importance, merely endless petty bickering. It seemed like not so much a feature film as an over-extended episode from a soap opera. Given that the film is about Thanksgiving, the word turkey inevitably comes to mind. Perhaps it is not surprising that this turned out to be not only Foster's second film as director but also her last for many years until the recent The Beaver. 4/10 "},{"Title":"This is an all time family classic","Date":"22 June 2006","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" When I saw this movie for the first time I was 15, and I laughed hysterically!!!

It sounded like it couldn't miss, and a comedy of a family struggling through a hectic Thanksgiving is usually an tried and true formula. So how did the talent here manage to botch the job? I think the main culprit is the script. The people who populate this film are not believable people, but cut-out stereotypes from a sitcom writer in a hurry to get an easy paycheck. In addition, all of the characters are so exasperating, I found myself hoping that a meteor would land on the dining room. The humor is so abrasive and the slapstick is so noisy, I couldn't laugh if I wanted to. A lot of the humor is derisive and mean-spirited, like a WASP version of an Andrew Dice Clay Thanksgiving. Then the film tries to cover it up by going all lovey-dovey during the final reels and risked the health of viewers with bad teeth. I will say this much in the film's favor- the actors do the best they can with the material it's given. There are some quiet scenes that work well and I wish there had been more of them. The film is bad, but it could have been even worse. I would rate it barely tolerable.

Holly Hunter stars as a mother in her thirties dreading the impending trip to her family's Thanksgiving. Slowly but surely it becomes glaringly clear that Home for the Holidays is not a particularly warm and fuzzy holiday treat, but a more truthful, abrasive version of many of the same images our culture plummets at us during the winter months.There's the tightly wound mother who's struggling to cope with her odd, aging husband, the crazy aunt who appears to be a narcoleptic, the weirdo brother whose lifestyle the family blindly denies, and the straight-laced sister who keeps her emotions under lock and key. The premise is reasonably humorous however the story tends to run off in meaningless tangents. There's definitely a natural feel to many of the interactions between the actors that are a testament to the ability of much of the cast and the strength of Foster as a director, but beyond being a worthwhile experiment at bucking conventional holiday film wisdom by making an honest movie, the overall picture is hardly a classic.

The worst is Cynthia Stevenson who makes a total fetish out of being normal and is forever acting like a martyr just for being born with this family. Her husband is Steve Guttenberg who just tries to take it with a smile.Although this has far more laughs, with a few more characters the main body of the film is structured like that Eugene O'Neill dysfunctional family the Tyrones.

This one is a gem. You can easily relate to it at various levels. be it the brother sister bond, be it a mom's anxiousness about the welfare of her children, the sibling rivalry, feeling left out, secrets, to feel lost even among family, to fail to read your kin although you've spent a lifetime with them. I personally do not quiet enjoy the family gatherings however as shown in the movie, once they are over there is a sense of warmth that sneaks in when you keep aside the negatives & realize, why we love the people that are present, what makes them the people that they are, and what is truly important in this life.We all grow older in life, so does your family. With time, people change, people in families change, what once bonded you may not now. The world sees you as an adult with children of your own, problems that are real, concerns that completely outside and removed from this group you have known since infancy. However, curiously, your family sees you as the kid who fought with your sister, and dated the class loser. And when you get together, you are faced with a 'not fitting anymore' crisis. My favorites are Robert Downey jr & Holly Hunter who play brother (Tommy) & sister (Claudia). Downey sizzles, entices and completely captures your attention.The movie opens with Claudia at the Museum, where she is informed that she is fired, after which, in a moment of spontaneity, she tries to make out with her boss. As she prepares to leave for a family get together at her parent's place, her teen daughter announces that she is going to make out with her boy friend. Claudia who is in a fragile mental state leaves a message at her brother Tommy's answering machine asking for emotional help. Tommy comes home for the holidays unexpectedly because he finds out his sister has just had a really bad day and dealing alone with the family would be unthinkable. He arrives in style with a male friend, Leo Fish, and proves to be excellent moral support for Hunter. Tommy ends up taking the inevitable flack for his being gay but lets things be and chooses to enjoy Claudia's company. He is also a catalyst, & helps ignite something between Leo & Claudia. There are many scenes where Hunter & Downey just speak with their eyes to each other. These are class & depict the deep bond they share as siblings. The movie has an open ending. This was the movie where Downey acknowledged the use of heroine while filming. What with the impeccable acting of his, you would not get a hint of this fact.

I actually thought it was a Christmas flick for the longest time, but it's a Thanksgiving flick. I remember seeing previews for it back in '95 when I was 12 and they were first advertising the film and I thought it looked so funny. But, I saw it on Showtime Monday (Nov. 5th) for the first time and it's not as funny as I thought (from the previews anyway). It's still a good holiday movie, though, and it seems the perfect time to write a little review considering Thanksgiving is just two weeks away. Speaking of which, this is like one of the only films ever about Thanksgiving. I don't even think I know anymore. Tons on other holidays though. It completely captures all that going home for the holidays isn't supposed to be but ends up being anyway. You leave for home, inevitably on the absolute worst day of your life hoping for some sort of relief from the rest of the world. Instead, you get your family. The old fights are dredged up, you're treated like you're 12, and everything sucks worse than it did before you left...I liked the acting in this film, especially from Robert Downey, Jr. and Holly Hunter, who had me convinced they were brother and sister. Anne Bancroft was good as well. She was funny and dramatic, and she seemed like such a Mom! Totally believable as well.The only complaint I have is that this film isn't as funny as I expected from the previews. It could have done some good to have more of that good ol' black comedy that I, personally, love. But, the movie does have some funny moments with its true-to-life approach on family get-togethers, and a number of touching ones as well. Overall, I'd say it's a good holiday film that's worth watching and definitely will be more appreciated being watched around its specific holiday, which is Thanksgiving.

However, for we huddled masses, this film is like a wee smiling angle in some newly restored Renaissance masterpiece as director Jodie Foster paints with brilliant flare a portrait of a typical middle-class family at Thanksgiving. That is a typical...less than functional...American family. We, who are products of such, know what's meant by that, and appreciate the true beauty of this work is that it lets you recall the pain and joy that only families can give.At first glance Home for the Holidays is a good-old-fashioned comedy about the reality of family values and holiday reunions. It follows the return of Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter), a 30-something never been married single-mom eldest daughter with an exotic career, to the childhood home for the much-dreaded last Thursday in November holiday feast. In the course of one short not-so-good day she gets a head cold and loses her glamorous job, self-respect, and fabulously stylish coat. As she prepares to board the plane her 15-year-old daughter, Kit (Clare Danes), informs her as a passing after thought...'I'm going to have sex with Tim, safely, and not in the car, have a nice Thanksgiving.' Dumbfounded, the terrified-of-flying Clyde now endures the always-bumpy mind-numbing siege of a late Fall flight from Chicago to Baltimore siting next to the somebody's mom passenger-from-hell. She is primmed, prelimed, and primed for a close encounter of the parental kind, yeks.Adele, (Anne Bancroft), is an all knowing neurotic chain-smoking...'why are you squandering your god given talents'...kind of well meaning mom with a more than slightly unsound but flatulent sister, Aunt Glady (Geraldine Chaplin).  Sweet Aunt Glady sports a Fruit Loop necklace and among other things belts out of nowhere...'I was a Latin teacher!' Henry Larson, the dad (Charles During), a recently retired BWI (Baltimore/Washington International) flight mechanic, spouts profound non-sequiturs and drives both the car and wife a little more crazy by the minute. With the grace of a slowly drowning pouch in the bottomless pool of parentally concern the diminutive Clyde shrinks ever younger with deafened eyes glazed just over the rim of a 10 year-old, three-sizes-too-big, spare, bright red, fluffy parka. Of course mom and dad play their hydrous little game of catch-up. When, from the back seat mom leans over and whispers...'I can see your roots Claudia'...and you're greeted at the door by Frank the cat coughing up a hairball, you know your really home.To Clyde's unbemused delight Tommy (Robert Downey), the favorite baby brother makes a surprise night-vision goggle raid that culminates in ballroom kitchen dancing with a slight maringay back beat and a late snack. They all know Tommy wears many hats as a successful Boston restaurateur, manic wisecracking prankster, Polaroid popping paparazzi, and a man's-man. But now he has a relationship secret that Clyde will pry out if it kills him. She thinks something awful has happen between Tommy and his significant other, Jack (Sam Slovick). She also resents, no questions her brother's new guy pal in-tow, short order cook Leo Fish (Dylan McDarmatt), incessant sucking up. That is, until it finally dawns that he's not gay and has been hitting on her.Tommy told Leo about big bad sister's earlier fragile in fight cry for help and showed him Clyde's picture. Hey, that picture, was something else...but was she naked...was she what...in the picture, Tommy showed him...was she naked? The most necessary but difficult piece of this eccentric jigsawed quilt is the wonderfully appalling Witmans freshly flushed from their curbside bunker. This passel of possum players is headed-up by the up-tight, resentfully compulsive, younger sister turned care taker, Joann (Cynthia Stevenson), followed in suit by husband banker Walter (Steven Guttenborg), brat niece Brittany Lace (Emily Ann Lloyd), and ingrate nephew, Walter Jr (Zack Duhame).To the melody of Nat `King' Cole's `The Very Though of You' this quirky cast lends the film the unforgettable rhythm of a tap dancer on a run-away roller coaster. Despite the many insane ups, downs, twists, and turns they don't miss a beat. At the end of the day, after the birds are et, all is said and done in the wake of the show and tell, and the last dish has been washed and put away, this lovely little comedy has a very small but special message. Although it maybe lasts for 10 seconds, tops&#133;the really important things in life are those brief, seemingly insignificant, sometimes tender, and often bittersweet situations we experience when we're with family. We always remember and cherish&#133;the moments&#133;and Home for the Holidays has more than a few good moments. "},{"Title":"Family.

To paraphrase one wiser than myself, it's the best of times and the worst of times, when you take the bad with the good and in the end, it's all about getting your priorities straight and figuring out who and what is really important in your life.  It's that day when truth and honesty hits you over the head and you realize that your own family just may drive you nuts before it's over; but at the same time, you come to understand what unconditional love is really all about, which is what a young woman discovers in `Home for the Holidays,' directed by the multi-talented Jodie Foster, and starring Holly Hunter.  Claudia Larson (Hunter) is a single mom who's just been fired from her job restoring paintings in a Chicago museum, as they've just lost 90% of their funding and can't afford her anymore; she's got a terrible cold, and when her sixteen-year-old daughter, Kitt (Clare Danes), drops her off at the airport, just before she drives off she informs her mom that she's decided to be intimate with her boyfriend on Thanksgiving.  And with that, Claudia boards her plane to fly back home to spend a good old fashioned holiday with her family  Her controlling mother, Adele, and her father, Henry (Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning); her uptight sister, Joanne (Cynthia Stevenson) and her husband, Walter (Steve Guttenberg); her eccentric aunt Glady (Geraldine Chaplin); and, she hopes-- though he's not supposed to be there-- her brother, Tommy (Robert Downey Jr.), the only one she can count on to keep her sane throughout the whole wonderful experience.  And quite an experience it is, as Foster takes you behind the closed doors of the Larson family, where Claudia tries to keep it together and along with the whole bunch tries to remember all there is to be thankful for.	Suffice to say that Claudia does a pretty good job of figuring it all out in the end, and along the way the audience has a lot to be thankful for, as well, beginning with this warm and insightful film which Jodie Foster delivers in grand style.  Working from a clever screenplay by W.D. Richter (adapted from the short story by Chris Radant), Foster really hits the mark with this one as she presents some characters to whom absolutely everyone watching will be able to identify and relate in one way or another.  Sitting down to dinner with Claudia and her family is like being at home with your own, and I guarantee you're going to recognize these people.  And the real success of the film lies in the way Foster is able to open up her characters and get them to externalize those inner-most feelings, those things we all think and feel but rarely find a way or a chance to express.  It's like being able to take a step back, observe, and say, `Yeah!  That's it!  I've been there!'  All of which proves what an eye for detail and what insight into human nature Foster possesses.  A lot of credit has to go to Richter and Radant, of course, but it's Foster who really hits the nail on the head and drives it home.  With a sensitive and intelligent approach, she manages to take the underlying drama of the story and blend it with the kind of humor that underscores the reality of the situation; and believe me, unless you're from the planet K-PAX, this is one that's really going to hit home with you on any number of levels.	To be sure, Foster had a great cast with which to bring her vision to fruition here.  Holly Hunter does a tremendous job of conveying that angst of being torn between being thankful for this time with her erratic family and just wanting to run for the exit; it's that ying and yang of life that we've all experienced, and Hunter captures it perfectly.  She plays Claudia in such a way that-- gender aside-- watching her is like seeing your own reflection in a mirror; it's so very real, and whether or not you like what you see this is someone you're going to embrace, because you'll readily discover all of the emotional complexities of your own life embodied in her.  Hunter brings a strong and subtle reality to the part, and it's the anchor of the film.  	Also giving a strong performance, though less than subtle, is Robert Downey Jr., who makes Tommy a character you're either going to love or hate, depending upon your own personal experience and frame of reference.  Which ever way you go, however, you're going to have to appreciate what Downey brings to this film.  He fairly bursts upon the scene and the screen with an energy that would make that famous bunny enviable and pale by comparison.  And let's face it, every family has a Tommy, and for that matter a Joanne, as well, whom Stevenson brings to life with acuity.  And one of the strengths of this film is the very real way in which the relationship between the siblings is presented; chalk up another point for Foster, as well as for the gifted actors portraying them.	And enough cannot be said about how much Bancroft and Durning bring to this film.  With terrific performances that successfully avoid any semblance of stereotype, they give definition to an entire generation and bring a perspective to this story that is invaluable.  The film acknowledges that these are flawed, but very real people, from her bunions to his pot-belly, and it's refreshingly real to see it portrayed as such on screen.	Excellent, as well, in supporting roles are David Strathairn (Russell), Austin Pendleton (Peter) and especially Dylan McDermott as Leo Fish.  `Home for the Holidays' is definitely a keeper; the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

The turkey, the stuffing the time spent with family you haven't seen in months, if not longer? What if, when it finally arrives, you just wish it would end?Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is a former artist who now works as a restorer in a Chicago museum. She is summoned to her employer's office during work, but does not know why. Her boss, Peter Arnold (played by Austin Pendleton) informs her that, despite overwhelming enthusiasm for her profession, she is being fired. Claudia protests and mentions coworkers that she believes more worthy of termination, only to find out that, for budgetary reasons, those same coworkers will be fired also. For no apparent reason, she proceeds to kiss her now former boss which ends with her unceremoniously sneezing. He then says, God I hate the holidays and that is the last we see of him. With Thanksgiving approaching, Claudia is driven to the airport by her daughter Kitt (played by Claire Danes) and told that she intends to lose her virginity over the holiday, as she will be spending it with her long-time boyfriend and his family. After entering the airport, the hustle and bustle of the season causes her to lose her coat. She calls her brother, Tommy (played by Robert Downey Jr.) from the plane and, getting his answering machine, proceeds to dictate all of these recent developments to a cassette tape. When her plane lands, she is greeted by her parents Adele and Henry Larson. Adele (played by Anne Bancroft) is a housewife and, before actually speaking to her daughter she remarks on her looks. Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but.This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between holiday movies and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities. This is a movie you can, and should, watch year-round.

It's interesting Hollywood pushes a fairly constricted idea of film. I'm not saying Hollywood stinks; it's just important not to think that's all film can be. And Home for the Holidays is a fine way to take a break from Hollywood. Give yourself that break; you deserve it.I really don't want to say anything about content. There's so much to recommend the flick, starting with the perfect writing, that it feels like it could almost have any content and somehow be wonderful.

So, Home for the Holidays strings it all together, with out-of-work Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter) going to her parents' home for Thanksgiving. Sure enough, more relatives are coming, all with more than a few eccentricities. What to do? It's hard to tell what most to notice while watching this movie. Each character has his/her quirks, but I couldn't really tell whether Claudia's personal life was supposed to be more important. But either way, it's a pretty funny movie. The whole scene with the turkey makes me feel safe to be a vegetarian.Anyway, Jodie Foster has shown herself to be a really capable director, with this one and Little Man Tate. I think that we need to pay this movie a little bit more attention in the future.

I used to make it required Pre-Holiday viewing for my kids just to prepare them for the festivities to come. Now they are all just about grown and pretty much now make us watch it together. The characters are too close to real for comfort sometimes, and it can be sort of self revealing to see how many of your own family traits you see. A good bit of the movie speaks to growing up and moving on in life. But in the end, while we do generally move on a lot of us never do much growing up. And who really wants to anyway.

Whatever may have failed in construction and timing, is more than made up for by the cast and the endlessly quirky, flawed (dare I say maimed) characters they portray.And what of the wonderful Cynthia Stevenson (Cynthia fans unite!!!)?  Is there not a casting director out there who realizes what a gem she is? Only Robert Altman (The Player) and Todd Solondz (Happiness), and of course Jodie Foster in this case have the courage to cast her against type.  In my opinion, she practically walks off with this movie as the relentlessly bitchy, put-upon caregiver sister to Robert Downey, Jr. and Holly Hunter. The turkey scene is a bona fide archive vault classic!  She currently seems locked in as the linchpin of the terminally sappy Air Bud direct-to-video franchise.

Daughter and single-mom, Claudia (Holly Hunter) heads home for the holiday following an awful two days of getting laid-off, catching a cold, having her daughter disclose that she and boyfriend are going to 'do it'   that weekend, and losing her expensive coat at the airport.   Her mother and father are aging, mother is still prying and attempting to set up the daughter with a man, and best of all, the whole batch of Larson's come together for what turns out to be a car wreck of a Thanksgiving Day. The film is a bittersweet look at the concept of home, remembrances, the continuum of generations, strange relatives, adult sibling rivalry,  and coming to terms with yourself in the present.  Although individual character development  in the film is somewhat exaggerated for humorous effect, don't all of us have an Aunt Glady somewhere on the family tree,  who has 210 plants to water (she knows the exact number), crafts Fruit Loop necklaces, and tips back one too many glasses of wine before dinner?  As Claudia (Holly Hunter) states in the aftermath, do you ever sit back and wonder, who ARE these people?   Dad has heart trouble, Mom is obsessively worried about her family, siblings still don't get along...yet through it all there is hope that the ebb and flow of life will give you back love in torrents, occasionally. Excellent cast, starring Dylan McDermott as the love interest, Robert Downey Jr. as brother Tommy, Charles Durning as father Henry,  Cynthia Stevenson as sister Joanne;  Geraldine Chaplin, Steve Guttenberg, and Claire Danes.

I just finished watching it for the third time, and it not only holds up, it actually improves with repeated viewings. I read a review that described it as dreary, but I think that you have to bring that with you to the movie. The movie has an indy look and feel to it,so it's very different from a National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation sort of comedy. It is the story of a mid-thirties single mother going (by herself) to spend Thanksgiving with her parents. The movie is relentless in loading the visit with every horror that has ever happened to any of us (the person in the next seat on the flight there is wonderfully irritating) -- no single event is really over the top, but the concatenation of them is hilarious. In addition, these events are interspersed with believable moments of genuine emotion, all keenly observed and well acted (the entire cast is excellent), so that together they present what is actually a touching portrait of a family. The movie also has the intelligence to not tie things up neatly -- no wounds are healed or trite life lessons are learned, for instance -- while still ending on an optimistic note (during which the woman's father observes that Christmas is coming, whether they want it to or not).

Hunter's performance is right on the mark, too -- she often overacts, but I think that it's perfectly modulated here. The entire cast is solid (Steve Guttenberg is perfectly cast as an obnoxious dope of a brother-in-law, as just one more example). The movie has many very funny moments, a number of touching ones, and leaves a kind of warm glow and a thankfulness that your own family isn't so weird.

The low-point of all of our OWN Thanksgiving Day holidays are optimized by the scene when Claudia first arrives at home, and is picked up at the airport by her Mother and Father.

There are moments in this film which are funny, some are bittersweet, and all are genuine. The best lines are delivered with the proper amount of subtlety, and these moments happen, because they are given the chance, nothing seems forced and when strung together in the fabric of this story, the sum of the parts is outstanding. All families have their dysfunctional side, which is explored here, yet not exploited. The idiosyncrasies of these characters are not simply the stock eccentricities given to relatives in most films, they are original and as real as one's own frightening family. Holly Hunter is down on her luck, yet her strength and optimism keep the film, and the family together. Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft provide a strong rythm for the soloists in this film, Hunter and Robert Downey Jr. who carry the show.

I don't like family dysfunctional plots at all but this movie was the exception. Holly Hunter's life is a mess. Her daughter tells her that she is planning on losing her virginity over the holiday while spending the weekend with her boyfriend's family. She loses her job (I think) and she spent several minutes writhing in a gross passionate embrace on the floor with her boss. She heads home to the loving arms of her family minus her gay brother (Robert Downey Jr.) who is staying away. Her mother played by Anne Bancroft is crazy but not nearly as much as her mother's sister (who gives away lamps-I loved that)the woman who had never gotten over her feelings for her sister's husband (Charles Durning) playing a slightly browbeaten retired father. Her brother's arrival with Leo (Dylan McDermott) in tow is confusing as she doesn't know if they are together or not. Her sister (Cynthia Stevenson) and Brother-in-law (Steve Guttenberg) arrive with children in tow to make the family chaos complete. I like interaction between Holly Hunter and Charles Durning. The scenes of the two of them watching old movies is really nice. It has a touch of normality and gentleness. The interaction with Holly Hunter and Dylan McDermott is good but I liked the scenes between siblings Robert Downey Jr. and Holly Hunter best. The 'we're the only two normal people here' bond between them and the 'ones that escaped' mentality works good while meanwhile Cynthia Stevenson plays the uptight 'I'm better since I stayed' role . I liked Cynthia Stevenson very much despite not liking her in other projects. Steve Guttenberg was good without his normal smirking persona. I liked him in the supportive character role. I think all the bits and pieces fit together into a really good story but not necessarily a holiday movie. My favorite scene is the flashback Charles Durning spoke about of the family watching a plane take off. The movie has some flaws, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s almost manic acting (of course we know what he was doing at the time). Geraldine Chapman as Aunt Gladys was wonderful. I loved her character.

This is all the more disappointing given the talent involved.Holly Hunter is a self-pitying and permissive mother, who after being fired from her thankless governmental staff job at a museum, French kisses her simp of a boss (Who else but Austin Pendleton? He is essentially playing his What's-Up-Doc character 20 years later).  As stupid as this is, I found it to be one of perhaps three not-hopelessly-cliched events in the entire movie.  Movie?  This is really one very bad and hopelessly long holiday sketch eschewed by Saturday Night Live -- even to the point of having Nora Dunn doing one of her stock-in-trade obnoxious bits.  But, given some of the reviews praising this wretched exercise in wasting talent, SNL may be the best barometer.  If you have enjoyed most of the skits (not regular features like Newsbreak) on SNL throughout the last 8 years, then you might wish to give this a shot -- especially if you are a big fan of the HBO Comedy stand-up specials.  If you long for the days when humor at wit as its soul in lieu of scornful derision, then watch Keeping The Faith instead.In Home For The Holidays, a magnificent supporting cast is worse than wasted behaving stupidly and obnoxiously throughout the film.  The pacing, especially for an alleged comedy, is funereal.  Compulsive dancer and twirler Charles Durning as the off-center but kindly father provides about the only smiles that aren't really smirks until the film's last 20 minutes.  His character would be interesting in a much better movie.  Anne Bancroft plays (what else?) the domineering matriarch as Durning's wife.  Robert Downey, Jr. appears to be on drugs as Hunter's devil-may-care-but-we-don't brother whilst Dylan McDermott elicits a faint feckless charm and Cynthia Stevenson whines incessantly. Claire Danes does the best she can given the atrocious dialog and stereotyped situation she is stuck with.  I could go on, but why bother?I can see where people who find humor in watching pictures of Lynndie England uses a leather leash to walk humiliated Arab prisoners might enjoy this hideous excuse for a holiday movie.
