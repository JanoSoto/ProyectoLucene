The characters stay with you, like family.(I'm not sure what a 'spoiler' might be with a title like 'Dying Young' - so, if you don't wish to know what the movie is about . . . skip this comment!)I've survived five different cancers since 1959. I've watched many others die from cancer, mostly because I've been treated in Veterans Hospitals since 1961 which had 'open cancer wards' of forty to sixty beds and we see all there is to see in each other's lives. I've seen this movie in real life, mine and many others' lives and families.You will be utterly absorbed by the consummate, intricate writing of Richard Freidenberg's adaptation of the Marti Leimbach novel and the 'invisible' direction - my finest compliment - done by Joel Schumacher.Throughout the film you'll be absorbed by the character's lives. How utterly real their pain, how complete their anguish, how deep their fear,how intense their love both of the cancer victim Victor Geddes (Campbell Scott) and the loved ones - especially the caretaker becoming lover, Hiliary O'Neil (Julia Roberts).If the Victor Geddes character had AIDS or Parkinson or Alzheimer's Disease? The audience and reviews would be thunderous applause; nines and tens. But about cancer? The audience is frightened to give acclaim to cancer, the shadow disease.The predictable audience reaction to a cancer victim story is amazing Viewers fear contagion! In real life - friends, relatives, loved ones are frightened to death to visit a person with cancer; to 'touch' them?, to breath their air?, to be nearby?. That fear is brought to the theater, to the television and to the VCR. Fear is the Bitch Goddess of Cancer and was ever present in 'Dying Yong'!I've never seen Julia Roberts (with whom I've been stuck since 'Pretty Woman) 'disappear into a role' as she did portraying the woman in love with a man dying with cancer. (I didn't see it in 'Erin Brockavich', at least not by comparison). Campbell Scott, playing the cancer sick Vic Geddes, is likewise consumed by the character and is invisible as an actor. There is not an actor before the camera throughout the film . . . just people about whom you Give-A-Damn; about people, not actors.This is an amazing film.Some might think I am biased because of my having had cancer Perhaps. But, to see the gut wrenching under current, words which are never said, emotions programmatically withheld, denial and lies issued and ignored even though instantly recognized until there is a no longer any ability to do so was (is) the most profound treatment of catastrophic illness I've ever seen on film. I kept wanting to yell at each character to speak up, shout, get it out, say something!(I wonder if those who have not had cancer had that same reaction.)I hope that those who see this film will see the magnificence of its incredible love story (in spite of illness!) and feel its adroit kick in the shin rendered against the 'silence and lies' between those about whom you care when ill. This story is about love, about life, not about death.If ever an actor deserved to be awarded an Oscar it was Julia Roberts' portrayal of a woman in love with a man dying with cancer in 'Dying Young.'See this film It is an incredible love story! You'll feel happy for all the characters, and, yourself.Killiam Tierney "},{"Title":"One word; Fantastic.","Date":"18 June 2002","Score":"25 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I bought this video in a sale for only Â£2.50 and although I knew it had Julia Robert in it, I thought that maybe this was going to be another Firehouse which..

If they had fully developed Vincent'Onofrio's character then this could have been a beautiful and powerful triangle, but they wasted most of the supporting characters.Campbell Scott was great as the young man dying of leukemia and gave a riveting performance as a young man who had never been able to fully live his life and groping for what he considers his last chance of happiness before dying.Campbell Scott also has the courage to be unlikeable and at times arrogant rather than a plaster saint. His inability to connect and understand the simple friendship offered by Gordon(Vincent D'Onofrio) is almost painful to watch. He envies Gordon's easy openness and zest, and is also jealous of the way that Gordon effortlessly connects to JUlia Roberts character,Hilary.The most poignant scene is when this young man of wealth, privilege, and education tries to relate with Gordon and Hilary who are getting a kick out of answering the questions to Jeopardy. He scores big on the questions that he studied in college, but grows more and more frustrated as Hilary and Gordon bond over their ordinary knowledge of TV shows-- like their singing the theme to Gilligan's Island. They are having fun, but Vincent can only see it as a competition.In that moment he sees a world that he has never known and probably will never really get, and he lashes out at both of them. Gordon is hurt and puzzled and Hilary is torn between anger and understanding.I wish that they had had Julia telling Gordon about how the character of Vincent was struggling with cancer, and having all three of them interact with each other bringing more depth to their struggles-- Vincent's jealousy of watching Hilary and Gordon interacting, and Gordon reaching out in friendship to help his new friend. It also would have given Hilary more insight into her emotions, and, when she made a choice it would have had more meaning.

It is a film that focuses on a man, Victor (Campbell) dying of leukemia and his internal struggles of wanting to be carefree and wanting total companionship from the Hillary (Roberts), the woman he hires to take care of him. Eventually, Victor wishes that he could be well so that Hillary can look at him in a different light; however, Victor cannot see pass his disease to allow anyone to be in his life including his dad and Hillary. He abruptly stops his chemotherapy to go live life and die; however, he does not seem to be living it since he so competitive and wanting to be better than anyone else. You want Victor to be cured of the disease and you want him to be less envious of the well people and to stop worrying about death and just live, which is the whole message of the film. Don't be afraid of death since we all will eventually die and no one knows exact time when death will wrapped them in his arm, which is a very powerful message. Great acting from Campbell and Julia.

Of course it's also a romantic tale of the relationship that develops between this particular patient and his caregiver.The movie chronicles the story of a young woman, Hilary, who, following a recent betrayal by her boyfriend, takes a job as a private caregiver to a rather difficult young man, Victor, suffering from terminal blood cancer. It dramatically depicts Victor's struggles with chemotherapy (the scenes most memorable to me), and Hilary's assistance, with its ever increasing emotional involvement. Julia Roberts brings her typical endearing qualities to the role of his nurse, who risks a broken heart by falling for a young man who is most certainly going to die soon. I've never seen Roberts in a role for which she didn't elicit viewer sympathy. Campbell Scott, son of actor George C. Scott, is also convincing as the young leukemia sufferer. My major complaint is Victor's lack of supportive family relationships (as I recall) or apparent faith. The movie could have been more meaningful if he'd had these, yet in addition, loved and needed Hilary. This scenario is dramatic, but it is unfortunate and simplistic that she is portrayed as his sole reason for living.Get out the Kleenex, folks, for the entire movie. I liked the ambiguous ending that left the viewer able to cling to the remote prospect that Victor might miraculously survive. Its message of course is the devoted loyalty until death that Hilary offers. Some viewers have mentioned an alternate suicide ending; that would have definitely ruined the film for me.

The actors, Julia Roberts as the hired nurse and Campbell Scott as the very sick young man are excellent and believable in their rolls. If anything this movie brings out the fact that he has a short time to live, how he chooses to live his life is what this movie is about. The story ends in a way which WE the viewer choose the path we want to see it. If you want a happy ending you can say that they left together and he was cured, BUT if you are realistic and are aware of how many lives cancer takes you know that they had their time together and eventually he dies. You don't know when you are going to die, nobody does. But we have now, so live with me Victor. Live with me--Hillary(Julia Roberts).

Quite intense. Campbell Scott's Vincent is a tortured young man who only wants to live enough to prepare himself for death. Julia Roberts' Hillary is essentially her Vivian from Pretty Woman (I hope everyone who sees this film is as unimpressed as I was with the shameless allusion to Pretty Woman when Hillary steps off the bus in -- gasp -- a red suit), but it suits the film well. But the passionate acting from Roberts, yes, but mostly Scott absolutely rends one's heart. When Hillary declares that she thought this guy was going to die, the audience is right there with her. Scott's performance is so rare and so special during these opening minutes because he is not self-pitying. He is aware of his disease, and he's trying to fight it. He's beyond emotional pain, and as he struggles through the physical pain, we start to feel it too. By the time Victor announces that his treatment is finished and he's ready for a vacation, the audience is ready for one too--it's really too much to watch a character we're instantly so attracted to come so close to death so many times.However, with the change of scenery comes a change of momentum. This is not surprising considering how emotional the opening third of the movie is--I'm not sure any movie could sustain that degree of intensity for the length of a feature film. Sadly though, the couple's time in the beach house becomes, as one critic put it, a kind of music video which features long shots of endearing moments between the two main characters. I would have liked to see more *real* discussions, interactions, etc. between the two than the endless close-ups of their pretty faces. The townsfolk are superfluous--essentially they're stock characters, cut-outs of real people that serve no real purpose in the film. Vincent D'Onofrio's Gordon is the most confusing character of all. He seems to have some sort of flirtation with Hillary, but this is never developed, explained, or resolved. A shame, as it could have added more drama to a section of the film that was sorely lacking in any sort of dramatic effect.The ending of the movie isn't bad, but it never quite recovers the momentum of the earlier section. However, I find that no matter how much I dislike the middle part of the film, I keep thinking about the film as a whole, and really really liking it. If you're prone to it, this film will probably make you cry. If you're not interested in tears, it's still worth watching because at the very least it will make you appreciate how lucky you are to not be going through what Vincent goes through--not having to make the decisions or sacrifices he makes each day.I recommend watching it at least once and forming your own opinion.

My favorite comment I ever read about him is this with George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst as his parents, this guy could run the Kentucky Derby and win.Julia Roberts, way before Erin Brockovich, shows compassion and a resilience to helping Vincent. Of course we know that she will eventually fall in love with him, as he does with her.I like that the movie ends in a grey area.

My friend also came to a point, when she did no longer feel the awful side-effects of the chemo worthwhile - but instead wanted her hair back, and to live as normally as possible and only take pain relief until the end. An end which would have been inevitable anyway. The actors are all first-class, and there are also many beautiful exteriors and interiors, party scenes, nature scenery etc.. The only thing I disliked a little, was the My Fair Lady-concept. I mean the rich and well-educated man, who teaches the simple but brazen working- class girl about art-history etc. - while she teaches him about life. And then, of course, they fall in love.

The story line of both is somewhat predictable, but Dying Young has an infinitely better script. In Dying Young the viewer truly empathizes with the characters, while in Love Story, neither character is worth knowing. Only the most sentimental will tear up in Love Story, while Dying Young bring most to tears. While this does not mean that it is a great movie, it does mean that the characters are believable and well acted and the story line is good enough to overcome its somewhat predictable premise.

At first, she just want to have a job and a life away from a mother who did not understand why she could not stay with her cheating boyfriend. She accepted the job of a caregiver just to get over a failed affair and be out of her mother's house. Day one, she was ready to give-up, after she experienced how complicated and difficult the situation with Victor after his chemotherapy treatment. (Julia was very convincing, she was Hilary)She however stayed out of compassion and although Victor being rich and an only child of a successful, widower lawyer, who often times was obnoxious, Hilary slowly found out there is sweetness in him. (Campbell Scott was at his best as Victor).Victor who was eager to experience life again, away from hospital treatments, deceived Hilary that he completed his treatment, so she would go with him for what he called vacation. They drove north to Mendocino, spent time alone together and fell in love. (If you are a woman, you will fall in love with Campbell; and if you are man, you would like to be taken cared of by Julia after watching these scenes)But without his regular chemotherapy treatment, he felt sick again after several weeks, but hid it from Hilary. Victor was competing with a local carpenter they met at a bar, Gordon, for Hilary's attention, worried that she will want Gordon instead because Gordon and Hilary have much in common. (Kudos to Director Joel Schumaker, for the subtle introduction of an almost love triangle) Hilary found out Victor was sick again and felt that Victor planned ending his life, instead of going back to hospital treatment. Victor didn't want to go back to a life he had for the last ten years, he wanted Hilary to stay with him until he passed. Angry and scared, Hilary left, called Victor's father, knowing he was the only one who can convince Victor to go back to treatment. So she thought. (I haven't seen Julia acted as passionately again in her other movies, as she was in this movie)For the last time, they attended a Christmas party by a local vineyard owner who befriended them during their so called vacation. When Hilary arrived at the party with Gordon, Victor was jealous. He was determined not to go back to the hospital again, left unannounced and prepared to leave and hide again. But Hilary knew him very well by then, he followed him back to the house and begged him to stay with her and get well. It was obvious they have fallen truly in love with each other, and determined to stay together again, hopeful, they left Mendocino to face the future whatever it might be. (This part of the movie was the best I've seen)The ending scene was inspiring, it touched your soul. It could have not ended any other way. After watching this movie in 1991, and many times again and again in the last twenty years, my mind hasn't changed - Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott have been my favorite actors the last two decades, and Dying Young my favorite movie of all times. To my regret, Hollywood don't make movies like this anymore. Thanks a lot to Sally Field.

But the fault does not lie with its two stars, and not at all with its director, Joel Schumacher, but with its writer, Richard Friedenberg.The screenplay is rather limp, playing with the rhythms of conventional melodrama far too often, and without any real zing. A movie can get by with being conventional, if a lot of heart is poured into it by the storyteller. But that is not the case here. Gifted as they are, Mr. Scott and Miss Roberts do not have a whole terrible lot to work with. She is hired by him, he takes a shine to her (could any man not?), she resists him but pities him, and then warms up, and voila! They're sleeping together. But that was all that I could sense from the picture. The two stars steaming up the screen every once in a while. They did not seem to have a real relationship. I cared a little more whether Mr. Scott's character lived or died, but even at the end, I couldn't have felt less on the question of whether or not the couple would be able to come together again. As if we didn't already know and expect. The script also touches on some good subjects. Chemotherapy, for instance and how it can help kill cancer, but also make life for the patient a nightmare. However, the narrative does not develop these moments to register an appropriate impact.Thankfully, the movie makes the wise choice of limiting scenes with the leading lady's mother. First of all, the dialogue is silly (she actually tells her daughter to move back in with her boyfriend, even though she caught him in bed with another woman, just because he paid the bills) and Ellen Burstyn's performance is sheer ham-acting.Telling the story in a solid narrative also seems to be Mr. Friedenberg's weakness. For the movie is told with a lot of big lumps to bounce over. Take for instance, a rather oddball scene with Vincent D'Onofrio. Of course, being a romantic drama, there has to be a secondary character to make the leading man jealous. Anyway, Mr. D'Onofrio brings them a television set, and they watch Jeopardy. The sequence proceeds to them trying to outguess each other on what the answers are, and just when it seems it might be leading somewhere, it all ends. The moment is nice enough, and grabbed my attention, but when it cut off, it left me wondering just what on earth the point of it all was. Yes, it did more or less resurface twenty minutes later at a predictable dinner scene, but not registering with much impact. And speaking of which, Miss Roberts' decision to run away from the hospital to the country house is rather awkward. Given the fact that the characters are not romantically involved yet.And just what was the point of Miss Roberts running into her ex-boyfriend in a bar? Where to or from did the scene come from? Director Schumacher is to be commended. Except in a couple of jump cut scenes at the beginning, in which we see Mr. Scott suffering from chemotherapy, he does a solid job of directing. Most lovely are his moving images at a country house the couple move into about midway through the picture. A scene in bed between Mr. Scott and Miss Roberts is handled wonderfully, with the camera swishing away from them just as they start to kiss and fondle each other, and then finding the mirror across the room. He also does something that I consider wise. Avoiding the sex scene. He shows us the beginning, and the end, but not the middle. Evidently, he had more faith in the story than the screenwriter.Not to say that Richard Friedenberg's screenplay is a hack-job piece of work. It's adequate enough, but not impassioned. The few tender moments are generated by Mr. Scott and Miss Roberts, and thanks to Mr. Schumacher's fabulous directing. And the movie as a whole is not bad by a long shot. But by the end of it all, it did not seem to matter what became of either character, and I did not feel as if I had gotten to know either of them. As a result, their relationship did not seem to amount to a whole heck of a lot. It's a great idea, with good intentions and good acting, but not much heart. Maybe the original novel by Marti Leimbach works better. I would be interested in finding out.

First she becomes his nurse despite no formal medical training, but later the two fall in love, even though they know their love is doomed to fail because of his leukemia.Sounds like a typical chick flick tear-jerker but manages to rise above that. Shows that Joel Schumacher actually is a competent director, something that was unfortunately tarnished and forgotten due to his misfortune of directing Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Julia Roberts gives what is probably considered one of her better performances as the frustrated young woman who reluctantly becomes the caretaker, but then falls in love with the ill-fated Vincent, only to be devastated by the fact that his poor health ultimately dooms their romance to fail. Vincent is also well played by Campbell Scott. Their chemistry probably helps elevate this above the usual sappy nonsense.

It is a good story made better by decent acting which should never be under-estimated.While Roberts was still in her early stages. Often cast as quirky, offbeat characters, after the success of Pretty Woman. She adds depth to the character of Hillary, a visiting nurse who ends up falling for her patient; well-portrayed by Campbell Scott.Roberts manages to be touching, and also comedic, without using cheap old standby tactics to make the audience like her- (When I think of this, I am thinking of Goldie Hawn, same quirky smile; or Jennifer Aniston-same gestures again and again to the point where it is formulaic and unbelievable.And the audience realizes they are being manipulated.) Roberts is the sympathetic character, Scott the arrogant well-to-do patient, embittered and dying of cancer.There is also a small cameo role with Colleen Dewhurst, and the ending is not trite and predictable. There are some beautiful scenes of the Northern California coastline. You will enjoy this film. 9/10.

Instead all I got out of it was some whinny self-pitying boob. Julia Roberts plays the part of a woman hired to be a nurse maid to Campbell Scott (as Victor Geddes)as he goes through the agony of blood cancer treatments. Victor Geddes comes from a well to do family with lots of money, and it struck me as strange that the father that hired Julia would not want to find a professional nurse instead of some blue-collar street girl. In any case Victor's cancer goes into remission and then they of course fall in love and head off into the woods. It has all the clichÃ©s of any cheesy love story.....Victor's cancer comes back of course and their love is tested but they are strong and he will fight the cancer and win.This film has 3 parts 1) Man has cancer--lost in self pity--meets cute blond chick with no knowledge of being a nurse.2) Mans cancer goes into remission---man and cute blond chick fall in love---run away to the ocean.3) Cancer comes back---love is tested---end of story.

I could not think of a better setting than the rocky Pacific coast of Mendocino, California with its melancholic moods and its somewhat eccentric population, to give perspective to the end of this tragic story. The pieces of modern art, shown in this movie, are gorgeous and most appropriate. I am no fan of the saxophone of Kenny G. Give me Ben Webster, Charlie Parker, Gerry Mulligan, Coleman Hawkins or John Coltrane anytime. This is a film for mature audiences. I am afraid that most young people don't relate very well to this kind of story.

So one thing it isn't, is subtle. If the first remission won't get you, the third one will.However, the first post-chemotherapy scene is quite harrowing and the hand held camera-work as Julia Roberts dashes from room to room after him as he shouts and vomits all over the place, is very well done. But then the film gets far too silky from there - instead of a realistic portrayal of a leukemia sufferer, we get a worthless romance with the illness somewhat slotted in the background. Can't somebody tell these people that there are enough romance films out there, and I for one would have much preferred a progression of the cancer storyline and it's impact on him - however uncomfortable that may have been, I just think it would've been a lot more worthwhile.If they had done that, maybe the film would be remembered and respected more than 10 years after it's release - rather than a film hardly anybody's even heard of.Quite a disappointment, I'd give it 4/5 out of 10.

These two never seem to connect on a soulful level, and she's so busy being coy, being tough, and being caring that it's difficult to get a grasp on her. Director Joel Schumacher might have been in over his head the film needs a light, sensitive touch and it's telling that the only well-directed scenes are the ones where Campbell Scott is being a jerk or when Roberts finally lashes out in anger at him near the end (the only time when she reveals something about herself that feels halfway real). It's always nice to see supporting players Ellen Burstyn, David Selby and Colleen Dewhurst, however Burstyn is terribly miscast as a half-wit who collects dolls, Selby has next to nothing to do and Dewhurst (Scott's real-life mother) has a introduction--whirling around with an electric smile--that seems as though she's destined to be the story's grande dame, its Arc Angel, when actually she's not even much of a catalyst in the goings-on. Dewhurst, like Roberts, is just decoration in Dying Young, which is perhaps why it seldom tugs at the heart. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"All heil Joel Schumacher.","Date":"15 August 2006","Score":"6 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" No, not really.
