On the contrary, he wasn't an actor at all, but a swell entertainer. You could stick him in a dumb situation and he could just jump in, act naturally, and have a whole lot of fun doing lots of stupid things. That's what makes his movies so damned funny.The story isn't anything new. A city boy is planted in a rural South Dakota farm town. He's an outcast at first (and likewise they're alien to him), but eventually they mesh and he rubs off a bit on them and vice versa. But, here, Pauley (as Crawl) follows his college friend to her home in the boonies for Thanksgiving break. Trying to avoid her boyfriend who just insists on getting married, she comes up with some story that they're actually engaged. Her parents are blown away by it because obviously they'd rather see her settle down with the townie than with the very strange Crawl. In the end, everything works out fine, obviously. The actors are swell. I particularly enjoyed Patrick Renna as the once-obnoxious little brother with a rad sense of humor. And of course, Pauley Shore was good at what he does making people laugh.Thumbs up.

Pauley Shore is invariably laugh-out-loud funny, and here is no exception. He is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold.His performance in this, although nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good, it seems to lift other cast members' performances. Perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce off of.The clich√©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way Shore's city boy, Crawl is so at odds with the way of life, is funny too, but it's not only he who's a fish out of water; comedy also comes from the fact, that to any ordinary person or people, Crawl is a freakish nightmare of a person. That's why this movie works in such a great way we love Crawl, he's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathise with the Warners. He is one hell of a culture shock.Although this movie is classic Pauley Shore, so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie, enjoy it you do, and there's even a never judge a book by it's cover type moral here somewhere. Not bad, not bad at all.

Movies like this one, didn't help.In Son-In-Law, Shore plays an incredibly-obnoxious character called Crawl, and yet he's the most likable of the family! His father is a profane idiot; his mother is totally incompetent, his young brother is a sex maniac and his college-age sister is a real snot.Watching an hour and a half of totally-unlikeable people was tough to do. I certainly wouldn't watch this again, or recommend it to anyone but die-hard Shore fans. Adam Sandler took Pauley's shtick and went a lot further with it.The following is an excerpt from the IMDb title page here under biography and it explains why I am not the only one who was disgusted with this movie.........but his lunacy was dismissed as crude, dumb and, for the most part, unfunny. His film career quickly tanked. This downhill spiral was not helped by the failure of his failed Fox sitcom Pauly (1997) in 1997.

This was the first movie, and much like Adam Sandler, you really have to like the man to like the movies.The film consists of people you recognise from other things, Carla Gugino looking really young, and Shore doing his stoner shtick that he did for the next three cinematic releases.As a standalone vehicle, a fish out of water comedy isn't a bad choice, and having a city boy come to the farm should spell hilarity, but it just spells out mild chuckling every now and again.It's the formula for easy nineties comedy, ninety minutes long, three perfunctory acts, something bad happens to out hero just before the middle of the third act, and there is a Scooby Doo ending.It's pretty clunky, dumb stuff, but its kind of sadistic fun to see a studios gamble failing with every film that was made.Brendan Fraser even makes a cameo, just to let people know Shore was in at least one good film....

The focus of this movie is the radical youth coming out to the traditional bible belt country of the United States and letting everybody know that he isn't all that bad anyway. Unfortunately in real life, such a thing will not happen, as the radical would be considered to be Satanist and turned into a social outcast.The movie is about Rebecca, a country girl who goes to Los Angeles to go to collage. On her first night she is ready to leave because everything is so different, but the Residential President of the college, Crawl, convinces her to hang around for a little while longer to see if she really hates it. In the end she changes and after three months, returns to the country with Crawl for Thanksgiving. This sets the scene for a huge culture clash, as Crawl's city ways clash with the traditional country ways.The focus of the movie comes when Rebecca's boyfriend decides he wants to get engaged, but Rebecca is having second thoughts. So Crawl suddenly says that he is going to marry her, which is of course a lie. So the now ex-boyfriend conspires to get back at Crawl and get Rebecca back. What we learn is that this guy isn't the perfect guy, and in fact is a two-timing, traitorous rat. This isn't overtly obvious, but there are a couple of times when the movie drops hints that he is dating Rebecca's best friend. The most obvious hint is when he dumps her after it seemed that she slept with Crawl in the barn.This is an enjoyable movie. Not something to write reams of commentary on, especially since it does not fully explore the cultural chasm between the city and the country. Rather it tries to show that the chasm is not really all that wide, and all the conservatives need to do is to accept the radicals. This is obviously written by the radicals because they show a spirit of tolerance for everything and it is the stuck up conservatives who need to change. My opinion is that we both need to work to accept each other (which is never going to happen). The radicals need to see that the conservatives like their traditional way of life, while the conservatives need to accept that the radicals wish to take a different road than they do. In the end though this is never going to happen.

Today it is hard to find a comedy that will make you laugh just like the one's from the 1970' and 1980's. It came out in 1993 and I can relate to this movie because that was the time I was in college too. It begin's with Becka going off to college, in California. Enven though her father Walter, played by Lane Smith, tries his best to change her mind and go to college in South Dakota. She goes to California where it's kinda a culture shock for her; and she hates it at first wanting to come home home. The RA played by Pauly Shore talks her out of it and she has made her 1st friend and saved herself from a mistake.The movie then gets close to Thanksgiving and the coming home to see her family and face the fact that her boyfriend from home might propose to her. She finds out that Crawl, Pauly Shore, will be staying on campus through the holiday. She kinda feels sorry for him; asks him to come home with her. She feels this is a way to get to know her family and also to get out of saying I do when she doesn't.When arriving home her family R shocked by her and Crawl. She's changed her appearance and feels relieved. The family freaks out by what she's done and at first can't stand Crawl, especially Walter. It takes awhile for the family to accept what she's done and it takes them longer to accept Crawl as a friend and supposedly a family member. When they go to dinner at a party of some kind her boyfriend tries to propose and Crawl gets in the way. He claims that he already asked her to marry him.Both he and Becka play along and as the movie goes along the Walter starts to warm up to Crawl, especially after the square dancing party. The next day Crawl goes fishing with Walter Sr. and Walter Jr., Lane Smith. They start to bond by talking about Walter's relationship with his father. The next thing they are talking when granddad appears to be having a heart attack. They, Crawl and Walter run to his aid. While Walter runs to get his father's pills, Crawl begins to attempt CPR on Walts dad thinking he needed it. When he begins to give him mouth-to mouth they both scare the s**t out of each other,This was one of the funniest parts of the movie When Walter asked his what happened, Crawl explains, he was trying to give his dad CPR, because he majored in it for a semester, he knew what he was doing. When they got home Crawl knew they both bonded and realized he needed to tell the truth but how.When Crawl goes th his bachelor party it gets worse. He gets drugged by the farm hand Theo and Becka's boyfriend. The next morning he wakes up in the barn with Beck's school chum. Beck'a finds them both and freaks, and tells her parents what happened. We come to fiend out this was a ploy for Becka's boyfriend to win he back and it eventually fails. The truth comes out in the end with an awesome ending.This movie is a great movie for the whole family. Pauly Shore and Lane Smith, winning pair. I believe this was one of Lane Smith's best movies and he is Hilario's too. Today he is missed but he will never be forgotten. The whole cast was great, but Lane Smith was tops, he kept me laughing to the end. This is a great comedy with a great ending you will not be disappointed ). Kris L.

Its premise is cute, but its delivery is a little strange. It's a comedy with Pauly Shore, so you're not going to get very clever humor. You're going to get below the belt jokes a lot of the time which is perfectly acceptable. As long as you know what you're getting into, you have no right to complain about the jokes.Now do the jokes work? Most of them do, but most don't come from the lead actor/actress. The most jokes come from the girl's brother played by Patrick Renna, famous from The Sandlot. Such a weird little thing to say that the character in the movie who isn't on the cover or mentioned anywhere on the back is the funniest character in the film. And, at the time, he was only known for his role in The Sandlot and I doubt many kids who took the time to see that film did the same for this one.The film is about a farm girl named Rebecca Warner (Guigino) leaving her South Dakota farm to go to College in California. Her parents, mainly her father (Smith), are skeptical about this College and worry that is may tamper with her original roots. She meets Crawl (Shore) who is the residential adviser of her dorm. Crawl is an off the wall kind of friend, and Rebecca thinks it's brilliant to bring him home to her strict family.In California, Crawl fits right in. In South Dakota, Crawl is a fish out of water. The rest of the movie is compiled of Crawl's misadventures to try to impress the family of Rebecca. One scene includes him of stealing one of the families machines and taking it for a joy ride throughout their field with John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy playing in the background. I'm not proud to say it, but that scene was hilarious.There is also a strange, not very well put together love subplot with Rebecca and her boyfriend. There is nothing to even show that Rebecca even loves or cares about her boyfriend. Most of the movie is her blowing him off on various occasions. Also, we are lead to believe that Rebecca is in love with Crawl. Honestly, that isn't too believable because there is nothing about Crawl's appearance or personality that could make him attract a girl like Rebecca. We are constantly told she is a smart and potential-filled girl who wants to be a journalist, but somehow, she falls for someone with no hopes, dreams, other than getting through to the next day.Son in Law doesn't have the humor or chemistry Bio-Dome or Encino Man did, but it's better than Jury Duty and a little better than In the Army Now. The one satisfying aspect of this is you can see Link (Fraser), the caveman from Encino Man (done two years prior to this), in a cameo role. That and the fact this is Shore's Weasel personality at full force. That can be a pro or a con. I, for one, had no problem with it.Starring Pauly Shore, Carla Gugino, Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Tiffani Thiessen, Dan Gauthier, Patrick Renna, Dennis Burkley, and Brendan Fraser.

After Googling her name, I stumbled upon a video clip picture that for me was instantly recognizable. SHE was the stunning brunette in the Bon Jovi clip for Always (1994). For 16 long years, I finally found out it was the gorgeous Miss Gugino (after not knowing all this time) who not only was in that clip, but also featured in a Season 5 episode of The Wonder Years. More recently, she was also in Night At The Museum with Ben Stiller. Going into the video store this afternoon, I decided to get out Son In Law which I recall seeing as a teenager and quite enjoyed. After the revelations of the past week I again was surprised to find a young Carla Gugino in the lead role next to Pauly Shore. This is your typical 90s looking movie, just about watchable but nothing spectacular. Pauly Shaw's character Crawl is pretty much the same as his character in Encino Man. But like most people who have commented on this movie, they can't help but mention the equally stunning Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from 90s sitcom Saved By The Bell. Someone mentioned in this thread she should have been in the lead role but the fact remains is Gugino over time has had a more prestigious acting career than Thiessen and her role in Son In Law shows this. In saying that, Thiessen is certainly memorable in this movie and easily sits in my Top 20 Hottest Females of All Time list. If anything, its great to see both of these girls in early roles and I don't agree with some people who have regarded this as one of the worst movies of all time.

The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend. Still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

It's a basic twist on an old formula here, young girl from conservative small-town America goes to college, meets druggie super-senior boy, brings him home for Thanksgiving, ends of up deceiving family into thinking they're engaged. Of course, Pauly's character ends up pulling the usual gags as he tries to make himself a farmer.There are plenty of flaws in this film, but it manages to make itself a pleasant and entertaining nonetheless. The fish-out-f-water comedy is driven by stereotypes of country and city life, and the two main characters are never really developed as characters. All we ever learn about Rebecca, the female lead, is that she is a college freshman impressionable enough to transform from conservative to rebel on the strength of a few trips out with her RA. That RA, in Pauly Shore, is never explored in the script very much either, but makes much more of an impression due to Shore's extravagant performance. His dopey, burned-out, uninhibited character is the kind that I might have considered unbelievable if I hadn't actually met people like that in college (likewise, the played-up college scenes at the beginning might have seemed over the top if they hadn't resembled a real college dorm slightly exaggerated).The movie turns on Shore's noisy but mellow Californian character, and most of the comedy comes not from the dime-a-dozen plot but from placing this particular crazy nut in a variety of incongruous situations. Often enough this works and while Shore might not be the greatest actor in history he certainly manages to put on a reasonably effective broad-comic persona. The best characters, actually, are Rebecca's family, which actually show hints of complexity and realism in their violent but understandable reaction to Crawl's intrusion into their lives, and their gruffness turning to friendliness.Don't expect any big surprises of heaps of subtlety from this mainstream comedy, but truth be told I had fun watching it "},{"Title":"... as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.","Date":"25 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This quote comes to us from Alicia Silverstone's character in Clueless, a mid-1990's American teeny-bopper update of Jane Austen's Emma.

The idea of a sweet, pretty, innocent small-town farmer girl going to university in Los Angeles (or anywhere else, given the state of modern universities) is indeed ripe for excellent material, but this is definitely not it. Character development is about as deep as a kiddie pool.Oh... and as for the jerk suitor?

Becca decides to attend UCLA, which slightly worries her parents Walter Jr. (Lane Smith) and Connie (Cindy Pickett). Her steady boyfriend Travis (Dan Gauthier who is best known as Brian Hanson from Saved by the Bell Hawaiian Style) is also sad to see her going to school so far away, and secretly starts to see Becca's best friend, Tracy (Tiffani Amber Thiessen who is best known as Kelly Kapowski from Saved by the Bell, Saved by the Bell Hawaiian Style, Saved by the Bell College Years and Saved by the Bell Wedding in Las Vegas). Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Becca experiences some culture shock both in the city and in her dorm. She meets her resident adviser Crawl (Pauly Shore), an eccentric perpetual student who shows her around. She also meets a girl who is a lesbian and has a girlfriend and sees them affectionately kissing each other. She eventually embraces her new surroundings and gives herself a makeover, buying new clothes in SoCal fashion, cuts and dyes her hair, and even gets a tattoo. Soon, however, she's faced with returning to her sleepy South Dakota farm and an inevitable marriage proposal from Travis over Thanksgiving Break. These mixed feelings lead to her spontaneously asking Crawl to come home with her.Needless to say, Becca's family and Travis are shocked by her new lifestyle and appearance, and by Crawl. Soon, Travis makes the expected marriage proposal, but Becca can't answer and Crawl steps in by saying that he has already asked Becca to marry him. This causes a lot of tension between the family and Crawl. He tries to fit in with the farming life, but he is ridiculed and forced to do jobs such as slopping the hogs and shoveling manure. However, Crawl loves the farm life and enjoys every minute of it. Walter and Crawl eventually get to have a heart-to-heart talk while fishing, and when Grandpa Warner has a heart attack, Crawl attempts CPR to save him. Afterwards, Walter and Grandpa Warner accept him, as does Becca's younger brother, who connects with Crawl's love of PC's and breasts.Travis, still seeing Tracy, is determined to break up Crawl and Becca's engagement. He slips Crawl a mickey, as well as Tracy while she strips in front of a lot of guys at the bachelor party, and gets the farm's hired hand Theo to place the unconscious two in the barn under the guise that they had slept together. Becca finds the two in the morning and jumps to that exact conclusion. She tells Crawl to leave, and it's not until Tracy tries to drive her car does she notice that something is wrong. Her seat is pushed way back, and she immediately deduces what happened the previous night.Tracy and Crawl enter the Thanksgiving dinner at the Warners with this evidence. It isn't long before Theo admits to the deed and Travis is caught as well. The Warners kick them out of the house (i.e. Becca and Tracy both dump Travis and Crawl beats him up in front of everyone (Becca, Tracy, Zack, Walter Sr., Walter Jr.,Connie and Theo) and Walter Jr. and Connie fire Theo), Becca and Crawl reconcile, and everyone (Becca, Crawl, Walter Sr., Wlater Jr., Connie, Zack and Tracy) sits down to enjoy Thanksgiving.

It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. The most I can praise Son In Law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero. There are a few amusing bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes Jury Duty seem like Gone with the Wind. - MERK "}{"Title":"Lame Comedy","Date":"1 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Perfect double bill for the horribly corny Beverly Hillbillies is this equally atrocious, lame brained 'comedy', Son in Law. Country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college, only to be assaulted by the lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' Crawl helps her settle in, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the wacky Crawl home for Thanksgiving, with obvious fish out of water results.The only other comic angle Steve Rash (aptly named ) achieves here is a sexual one. This he bludgeons us with, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the film is groping when Crawl hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field.Dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from Crawl misfiring. Between them Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder. The problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like Crawl, and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why Rebecca would want to spend a moment with him. However, if you're a fan of unintelligent comedy, Son in Law is right on the mark.Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.

Looking like what would result if Richard Simmons and Weird Al Yankovic had a child together, he is the unlikeliest of movie stars.  Yet somehow, for a time at least, he managed to carve out a career for himself as a comic leading man.  This film is often cited as one of his least annoying, but even here he is sometimes hard to take.  He plays a way-out, overaged college student who winds up coming home for the Thanksgiving holiday with a pretty freshman from the country.  Once there he offends, then predictably wins over, her family and friends......most of them anyway.  The film is undeniably predictable and familiar and the material is very slight.  Yet somehow, in spite of its hurdles, it manages to entertain to a certain point and actually contains a few laughs.  Shore, as agonizing as he is, does occasionally score a thoughtful moment or two among all the slapstick and crude language.  Gugino is lovely.  Her presence adds immeasurably to the overall geniality of the film.  The actors portraying her family do a very nice job as well.  Smith as the father is suitably outraged by Shore.  Pickett adds dimension to a pretty standard role.  The best are Renna and Adams.  Renna plays the obnoxious younger brother role to the hilt.  It would be hard to come up with a brattier persona, but he puts a fun spin on it.  Adams get a late career gem of a part as the cantankerous grandfather and steals many of the scenes he is in.  To the director's credit, none of these characters get shorted in their opportunity to present themselves.  (In other words, Shore isn't the ENTIRE show here.  The supporting cast gets to shine as well.)  Also present are hunky Gauthier as Gugino's former boyfriend (often looking like Tom Cruise in All the Right Moves) and sexy Thiessen as the local easy mark.  The movie is already dated in terms of its clothing and other aspects.  Shore gives Pickett a makeover and it's hard to see why anyone thinks she looks better than before!  Fortunately, the thing doesn't drag on for too long.  It's just a short, sometimes funny, sometimes sweet, sometimes stupid movie that is blessed with a few enjoyable performers and a refreshing lack of undue sex and drugs.
