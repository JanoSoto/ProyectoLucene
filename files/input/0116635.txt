To concentrate on the deep love story between Feynman and his first wife Arline, which coincided with his work on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, was, I feel, a good filmic move in order to give the story an anchor (not to mention the fact that it truly is one of the most romantic real love stories I've ever heard of). Every movie adaptation has to make sacrifices, and this one obviously had to sacrifice all the other interesting stuff that happened to Feynman in the years after the war. So I don't have a problem with the quality of the script, and they also had a big enough budget to get the period feel.However, this film falls down in a major way on the characterisation of its lead character. Surprisingly, for Broderick is not a bad actor, he just comes across as being Broderick - a good looking young man who can look lovingly at Patricia Arquette and add a bit of passion to his voice when explaining complicated physics. But we've all seen the real Feynman on television and in film - he was LARGER than life! He was intensely charismatic, a brilliant expositor of scientific ideas and a great teacher.It seems to me that instead of succumbing to the temptation of directing, that Broderick should really have got someone else direct, so that he could concentrate on really getting inside the head of Feynman and reproducing on screen some of that charisma - something I'm quite sure Broderick is capable of doing.So ultimately this is a missed opportunity. You learn some of the facts about what happened, but you don't really meet the real Richard P. Feynman.

But, whatever your age, if you want simply a nice movie, you have one here.Other reviewers here have gone into the details about the real-life persons this film is based on, so I will just make a few general comments I had while watching this.First, I enjoyed Matthew Broderick's narration. Broderick usually plays likable roles and is an underrated actor, I think. I've never seen him in a bad performance. Even though this story is an emotional one, I found little emotion in the film but that makes it intriguing in parts.Sometime past the halfway mark, I asked myself, What is the point of this story? There is a point, and there is more than what meets the eye to this. Those who have seen this film know what I mean. I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything.I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low. As I said, it's a nice film and touching drama.Broderick and his mother wrote, produced and directed this film.

Broderick also co-produced and directed the movie. Keeping it in the family, the screenplay was written by Matthew's mother, Patricia Broderick. The other major role, that of Feynman's first wife Arline Greenbaum, was played by Patricia Arquette.Infinity is not a documentary about a phase in the life of Feynman the scientist, my expectation. My first impression as the  movie unfolded was disappointment. I have been intrigued by Feynman the physicist and scientist since I purchased his Quantum Mechanics lectures trilogy in 1968. As the movie progressed, I saw that it isn't a movie about science; it is a movie about the heart. The point of this movie is to portray Feynman the person, and his relationship to the love of his life, Arline Greenbaum; in this it succeeds wonderfully.A few years back, while reading one of Feynman's books, I ran across a passage which made a big impression. Feynman wrote that his children, who were raised in private schools and visited home only during holidays, were known well enough to him that if he were to meet one on the street, he would probably recognize that person as his child. That statement helped convince me to move from academia to the business world, making becoming a better father and husband my top priority. After seeing this movie, I better understand Feynman the person. The tragic loss of his first wife probably produced a life-long desire to hold personal relationships at a distance, and to make research and teaching his top priorities.Broderick does an impressive job of directing the film. Just one example at the moment of the death of his wife, my expectation was for there to be intrusive weepy violins. Instead, the moment moved through silence, making a more powerful statement. That scene reminded me of George Burns pulling down his shoe box of old photos from the top shelf of his closet, and looking at them quietly in Going in Style, a scene which packed an emotional punch without resorting to violins.There is another dimension to the two Brodericks' intelligence which surprised me they did not botch the physics, what little there was. Nearly every Hollywood movie which has an opportunity to do so, gets the science wrong... having space ships produce impressive sounds as they move through the vacuum of space, for example. Matthew Braderick as Feynman explains beta decay to his wife using olives from his lunch in an approach worthy of the real Feynman. Also, Feyman's father explanation of inertia, in which he differentiated between being able to name it and describe it, which he could do, and understanding the why of it, which no one could do, was a deep understanding of science which Broderick portrayed with sympathy and understanding. By staying away from complex mathematics and the physics that could have been incorporated into this story, to the delight of the geeks of the world, Broderick created a movie that is accessible to all.Infinity is a gem of a small movie, a love story, a true story, told with gentleness and feeling; a movie which does not overreach itself. I strongly recommend it.

Matthew Broderick's performance doesn't capture the fire, playfulness and wonder of Feynman's personality (as do documentaries of his lectures). Furthermore, his direction botches many of the anecdotes, missing the points of emphasis and undermining the quirky humour and sense of irony in the original telling. For example, in the Chinese abacus scene (which is shifted to a much earlier period in Feynman's life), Broderick has Feynman initiate the challenge, whereas in real life, it was the hapless abacus salesman who challenged him, completely unaware that he was taking on a renowned physicist. Therefore, the sense of irony, and of Feinman's idiosyncrasy in the world of mere mortals, is lost. Only Patricia Arquette seems to have captured the essence of the memoirs, despite her often unintelligible dialogue.

I first launched myself into physics because of the books that feynman wrote (well, spoke) and i received the full set of the feynman lectures before i started college.Matthew Broderick has always been one of my favorite actors.  I liked his nerdiness and i could relate.  So he was one of my reasons for deciding to branch off from physics and start a film career.In the end, though, i see why i always have a little regret for not sticking with physics.  Film could never fully realize what it means to be in love with science.  I understand that Feynman loved his wife, but he loved everything, that's what made her so important, he could never tire of learning to look. just like her.But this film really doesn't get that across.  Plus, instead of relying on smart direction and good editing they give the game away in the opening titles, which are ridiculously lame.**SPOILER** (please it's a real story go read the book)The intercut to the parallel line of the Trinity test explosion is a neat idea, but ultimately poorly executed and timed.  But i see where they were going.  But they missed it.  Because the explosion for feynman is when he sees the dress, not when she dies.  remember that great advice, you can call it whatever you want in a thousand languages but that doesn't mean you know it. When feynman sees the dress, he *knows* what it means for arlene to die.  He can't share with her anymore, that is what her death *is*.  and that should have been the point.  you've got to learn what a thing is before you can tell someone else. Feynman was a great man, but he had his flaws.  However, the number of people he has influenced is incredible.  And i'm glad that somebody made a film about him.  However, Feynman's clipped style of speech, what made him so unique and distinct, is not available to the viewer and it cheapens it.I'm sorry to say that i did not like this film.  In fact, it made me a little  angry to watch it and see my hero stripped of his unique story.

I adore Richard Feynman, he being my favourite scientist and one of my two heroes (the other being Itzhak Perlman) to really try to aspire to be everything I can be. I think everyone should read his books (even his Physics lectures, even if you hate Physics. He makes everything worthwhile). Onto the film... The film starts out with the sweet, gentle relationship between father and son, taking direct quotes from Feynman's own novels (he actually didn't write them; they are accounted stories) Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman! and What Do YOU Care What Other People Think? and letters and such. It progresses through Richard's days in high school, to meeting Arline (that is the correct spelling) onto MIT and Princeton (pre Los Alamos). During this, my biggest complaint would be that the film moved way too fast. There were some lines (Look I'm gorgeous) that were just beginning to show Feynman's character and his way with humour, but it plowed right through them onto the next scene. I think Broderick was so intent on keeping everything to the book, he forgot some very vital elements of what made Richard Feynman Richard Feynman. What really grasped Feynman's character was when the film steered into the direction of Feynman's days at Los Alamos (working on the bomb) and Arline was at the sanatorium. The film showed just how much fun Arline had with Feynman and vice versa (I loved that the film included Feynman's birthday present from Arline!). It also showed the tenderness, yet sometimes almost absent love of Feynman. In Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Tack the letters of Richard Feynman, he writes a letter to Arline before she dies telling her how he wished he would have been there for her more, loved her more, etc. I think the film really captures that, even before the book was published, Broderick had a sense of what Feynman was going through. He didn't really know how to handle his wife dying. Lastly, I loved how they implement Feynman's love of drumming. It really didn't become an obsession until much later (when he went to Brazil after Arline's death), but the film shows the beginnings of a love that Feynman would love until his death (a number of his friends joked that he was going to spend his Nobel earnings on a new bongo drum). There were flashes of the Feynman people know and love, but it didn't really hold true at the beginning. One thing that seemed confusing was a brief snipet involving Broderick as Feynman hearing about a baby. This is most likely in reference to a pregnancy scare that took place when Arline was in the sanatorium. They thought they'd have to abort the baby, but it turned out she was pregnant and that she was just malnourished because of her illness. They didn't explain that very well though. Next they need to make a film about his marriage to Gweneth and his later years winning the Nobel and working on the Challenger. Even though I don't act, I could play Gweneth! hahaha, yeah right.

Nash was one of these thinkers who lived in the world he created, which is why `Beautiful Mind' was such a disappointment. Feynmen was a different sort of beast altogether. For him, the world was real, and he lived in it. He was among the best at forming elegant models and describing them to others, but it was all from the solid foundation of him in the real world. So a film about him in an artificial film world is not possible, which is why Broderick's approach is so apt. The problem is that if you focus on him as a person, he is a pretty ordinary person.I suppose that's what the Brodericks wanted, a `small film' that they could manage.

He is so unique that this is a massive oversight, to say the least. Despite his tragedy, I am sure he was just as irreverent and humorous during the Manhattan project as he was for the rest of his life. Yet only a couple of snippets show this irreverence and humor and even those are done badly. One is the repetitive exiting of the Los Alamos site to demonstrate the lousy security they had despite rigorous examination of everyone entering the site. The other was when he first met with the students in the data processing lab. That one too was far below what I'm sure the real Richard Feynman would have done, judging by how he treated his students in almost all of the lectures I have listened to.So Broderick took a whole person and cut him in half, only showing the intimate portion of his life and relationship with his wife that he loved so dearly. He almost completely left out the public persona of the man and this hurts the movie so badly that it never really recovers from it.

During this time he got his Ph.D. from Princeton and participated in the Manhattan Project. Also in that time frame he met and married Arline Greenbaum. There are a couple of scenes, with Feynman being around the age of six, that establish his inquiring mind and his relationship with his father, but the main thrust of the movie details the relationship between Richard and Arline.Having read Feynman's books Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other people Think, as well as having viewed several of his videos on YouTube, I felt that this movie did not capture what I perceive as Feynman's impishness and openness. Maybe this was because during the time period covered Feynman was dealing not only with his early career challenges but also with the serious health problems of Arline. I thought the movie did a good job of detailing how Feynman coped with the difficult conflict between his professional ambitions and his love and devotion to Arline.I suppose most people's image of the 1940s comes from looking at bleached out color photos and videos from that time. Whoever decided on the lighting for this movie must have been under the impression that that is what things looked like at the time, since there seems to be some sepia-toned cast to much of the film. I suppose the desire was to add some sense of nostalgia for a past era, but I found the rather dark filming fosters an overall fogginess.Feynman's academic career was glossed over with there being little desire to inform the audience as to what his scientific interests were. There was no mention of what his contributions were to the Manhattan Project, or why he was chosen to go to Los Alamos. There was some odd editing like the insertion early on of a hand tossing out small pieces of paper from atop a wooden post. After the atomic blast at Alamogordo there is a scene of Fermi doing some measurements of how the pieces of paper were scattered in order to estimate the power of the blast, but this was not made clear enough for most people to make the appropriate deduction. Also, the movie has Feynman looking at the atomic blast with unaided eyes which would have caused retinal burns.The score tries to be manipulative, but winds up being intrusive. Every time there is a tender moment some sappy music is played.I wish this movie could have given more of a hint of Feynman's being a witty, free-spirited genius, which I think he was.

What he has achieved in science and what he has done outside science... he was such a character. To me, one of the most interesting characters I know.Everything begun well. There was certain quotes from Feynman's books that I expected. I was happy. But soon enough I realized everything was not OK... this was only a love story between Richard and Arline! No, there is certainly nothing wrong with a love story. This might be a decent love story between two individuals. But for people who know who Richard Feynman was, this must be a huge disappointment. He was so much more than this. He deserved more than this, and I still hope he gets a movie which is more than this.If you liked the movie and ended up wondering what else Feynman did during his lifetime, read his books (start up with Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman). Even if you did not like the movie, but you want to know more about Feynman, read the book. If you are, or if you are not, interested in science, read the book. Feynman deserves to be known better... he is one of the best scientists of our time, and one of the greatest persons of our time.

It should be given extra marks for trying very very hard not to be schmaltzy, even though it still is. British viewers may be reminded throughout of Frank Spencer - the modulation of Matthew Broderick's 'jewish' accent has distinctly ooh Bettyish notes. "}{"Title":"My most sincere thanks, for trying.","Date":"10 January 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" **A review for those who have already watched the movie**There are a lot of great stories to be told; I often wonder why so many have not been. A swordsman who wins over 100 duels in his life, his first beginning at the age of 13, and by his twenties maintains the handicap of using a wooden blade. Yet the tale of Miyomoto Musashi is one that I have not seen put to film. The world is full of people who tell us what we can not know, yet whether or not they are as wise as they may believe themselves, I have yet to see anyone argue another's ignorance as convincingly or as wittily as Socrates (and with a crucial difference, by first asking what they know, and actually listening to how they think they know it) -- or for as noble a purpose. So when I found that a movie had been made about one of my heroes, I was very eager to see what it amounted to.I assume that either Matthew Broderick or his mother (or both) who wrote the screen play, must also have been a fan of Feynman. I wouldn't suppose to know everything about Feynman, but I have made an effort to learn everything that I could. I have read his books, looked through his Wikipedia and looked at just about everything I could track down that had anything to do with him.For me, as a physics student, the appeal of Feynman is mistranslated in the movie. He of course, was no ordinary genius, but how he accomplished what he did was as important (to the niche audience) as what he did, and the how seemed to be missing. Feynman developed his capacity for mental math during the Manhattan project via competition with Hans Bethe, and the development is key. The abacus scene was terrible for several reasons, some of them outlined in other reviews, chiefly for misrepresenting Feynman's personality. However the scene also sold out the accessibility of intelligence as something unique to certain individuals, that this was something 'natural' to Feynman. Feynman's IQ was measured at 125, which is supposed to be 15 points below the average PhD. Now, I'm not going to argue about the validity of IQ testing, one of the major personality traits the film wasn't able to touch on was of Feynman's insistence that people were incapable of measuring the aptitude of others' with tests. This low score however, was what is truly inspiring about Richard Feynman, that he never claimed to be more than a normal man. All his ability came from work driven by passion and love. Feynman wasn't a Japanese 4 year old who could speak 5 languages and solve Rubick's cubes blindfolded in 7 seconds. He was a lover of life and of learning, and it was his passion that motivated him to work hard, and his love that drove him to never give up and believe he could accomplish anything anyone else could. The real lesson of Feynman is that anyone can reach for greatness, and with drive and effort and luck attain it too. The Feynman story is one that allows us all to believe in ourselves, not one that should make us feel intimidated or insignificant. When Feynman can beat the abacus man at 18 with no background story of how his abilities came to be, it is far less inspiring.The performances were satisfying, but the story development seemed rushed, especially in the beginning. There was plenty of room for drama in the competition for Arlene with Feynman's old friend Howard without the need to throw in so many anecdotes that disrupt his life's true time line. I think that if you go through the books Feynman wrote only once, you miss how truly stressed Arlene's diminishing health made him. He was in many ways a subtle man, and private. When Feynman writes, I feel like he blindsides his readers from ever detecting how much he was hiding from them, with the sheer vulnerability he subjects himself to with his honesty. You can't see what hes not saying because he has already surprised you with the courage to say so much more than most people will admit to. To know how he was really feeling I think requires reading between the lines. When Feynman sees the dress, it is a total breakdown, it is overwhelming. In everything Feynman ever wrote, that was the only time he ever confessed it was too much. I can hardly think of the scene depicted in his books without coming to tears, even now. The story of he and Arlene really is, as another reviewer put it, one of the greatest real love stories I have ever heard of.I don't know much about movies, and I understand there are limitations. You can't fit everything into 90 minutes and the book is always better. I would be curious to hear Mr. Broderick explain why he went the way he did with certain aspects of the film. I certainly couldn't comment on whether writing, acting, and directing simultaneously would have been too much. If the film gets anyone to go and look up Richard Feynman, I think it will have served its purpose.

The film is not about physics, but about the tragic love story between Feynman (played by Matthew Broderick) and his wife Arline (played by Patricia Arquette). This film, because of its subject matter, was always going to be for a niche audience, but was well worth making. The screenplay was written by Patricia Broderick, Matthew's mother, and they jointly produced the film. It is a pity that Broderick has not had further directorial opportunities in the years since this one, as he has a talent for it. But that is how ruthless the film business can be, as this was clearly no money-maker, because it is too quiet and sensitive and has no super-star to give it the public acceptance. It is a sleeper that did not awaken. Films where one of the leading characters is ill all the time (Feynman's wife), and especially one who has tuberculosis, are not generally successful at the box office. The last time TB made any money was with Greta Garbo as Camille. So by deciding to do this worthy project, the Brodericks were closing the door behind them. Investors hate TB and soft, gentle films in equal measure. (They prefer explosions and healthy killers.) I recently saw Matthew Broderick on the TV series WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? where he traced his ancestors. His grandfather served in the First World War and his great-great-grandfather served in the American Civil War. (The programme resulted in his grave, which had been anonymous till then, having his name put on it. Previously he had been the unknown man killed in action outside Atlanta in Georgia on the Union side.) In the TV programme, it was obvious that Broderick is truly Mr. Nice Guy, all modesty and smiles, and that the 'boyish charm' for which he is renowned is perfectly genuine. Even though it was not his first film, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986, see my review) burst like a comic miracle upon the scene at the time and launched Broderick, through the genius of John Hughes. Broderick is if anything even more delightful and amusing today. But he can be perfectly serious when required, as with this film. There is no use people complaining that Broderick is not as dynamic and mesmerising a presence as Feynman in his maturity in this film, Feynman is never older than 27, so cool it. For much of the film, Feynman is working at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb. Names like Wigner, Oppenheimer, and Fermi are mentioned, but we don't see them. There are some intriguing references to the spy Klaus Fuchs, but all we see of him is his car which Feynman borrows. Fuchs's keys are missing at one point, but we aren't told why. Presumably the man picked up by Feynman in the nearby New Mexico desert and given a lift, who pretends not to speak English but actually is fluent in it, is a Soviet agent passing messages for Fuchs, but this is not spelled out. Some of the script must have been cut, but it would have been better to leave those things in. There are many intriguing aspects to the story which are suggested in passing. For instance, Feynman raises the issue of the enrichment of Uranium. Someone ought to make a film about how the Uranium 235 was brought from Germany in a submarine (U-234, coincidentally) at the end of the War and used for the bombs over Japan because America did not have enough ready. But all that is a digression, This is a very fine film and deserves recognition, as it is well made and genuinely felt, and is eminently worthwhile. "}]
