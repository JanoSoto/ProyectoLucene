Are we living in a totally one-dimensional society these days that has no time now for unsupported fantasy - Just the facts Ma'am, Just the facts!We have here an adult fairytale no less, yet what do I read (and I include paid media critics here) but absurd negative comments such as How did McConaughey and his intrepid band of marines come up with the fuel to cross the atlantic?  Why are the children seemingly so well fed in a period of pestilence?  Where does the seemingly limitless fuel come from? etc etc. Who CARES?????????   this is a DRAGON fantasy for God sakes! Someone want to set up a Government enquiry as to why fairies speak English? the possibility that Humpty Dumpty had a middle-ear infection? Perhaps the Easter Bunny has some communicable diseases that he should be tested for?Ok REIGN OF FIRE is not up there with other sci-fi classics and the marketing department should be answering charges of misrepresentation for that poster showing an aerial armada of helicopters battling the fire-breathing beasties over central London - that just never happens but I gotta tell you REIGN OF FIRE has some of the greatest set designs and cinematography I have ever seen. It is extremely interesting to LOOK at from a technical viewpoint. The dragons themselves make the least interesting contribution to the film and except for the final confrontation which almost gets there they are really secondary to the film itself. If you were to actually record the amount of dragon screen time I doubt it would be 18 minutes....and most of them are not far off laughable. Curiously, that aspect alone should have wrecked it for me...but it didn't - I found the wasteland asharamas totally credible and involving.I thought the much maligned McConaughey's role not without interest. Still haven't worked out whether or not Mad Matt was supposed to be some hybrid creation - part Patton, part Maximus, part Captain Ahab or just all grunt. He certainly handled his last solo flight with flair and derring-do. Basil Rathbone himself never swung a meaner sword! Christian Bale replete with his best know wot I mean brit accent was pretty good I thought as Quinn the reluctant colony leader. What I couldn't believe is how the years have treated Izabella Scorupco the most beautiful Bond girl I ever saw (GOLDENEYE). I realise that a decade of fighting dragons and close-contact aeriel combat takes a lot out of a girl but she looked 20 years older! I would never have recognised her. Totally shattered an illusion I have maintained of her. If she said Boys with Toys now, I think I'd need a double vodka-martini!But I digress.  The dragon fx were just so-so, they saved the best for last sensibly. The script had its moments but the production work and set-design were simply awesome...SO good in fact, the rest of the film really didn't matter! Overall I would bequeath it a 6.9. Worth seeing if one is prepared to watch it in the spirit that it was made.

There was no nonsense, no tongue-in-cheek humor or special-effects just for the sake of it this was simply a humans vs. dragons story taking place in the future. No laughs and nothing hokey, which is what I expected. They played it straight, simply as a fight story between the two parties.Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure. The dragons were realistic-looking, the scenery dreary but the story interesting and intense in spots.I wouldn't buy it, but I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a night of adventure on film. You could do a whole lot worse, especially with two young actors who have arrived as stars Christian Bale and Matthew McConnaughey.

It amazes me that so many people are quick to put the boot in to this (admittedly) silly but entertaining b-grade post-apocalyptic thriller yet line up to watch the absolutely awful and overblown Star Wars movies. Yes, I said b-grade, because despite the budget being close to $100 million, that's exactly what it is, a b-grade sci fi movie, no more, no less. Fans of Roy Ward Baker's 'Quatermass and the Pit', Larry Cohen's 'Q The Winged Serpent' and Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce', all of which 'Reign Of Fire' reminded me of at various points, will enjoy this one more than the Blockbuster crowd. Christian Bale ('American Psycho') and Matthew McConaughey ('Frailty') are both pretty good as the leader of an underground community and a hardass military man respectively, who both have different approaches to their shared problem - the ongoing threat of dragon attacks. Yes, in this future dragons are real and have devastated the world, and only a handful of human survivors exist.  Once you can accept that premise, and some of the scientific explanations for the why and wherefores of the dragons, you're in for a wild ride. No-one's gonna argue this is a great movie, but it's a lot of fun, and I recommend it, especially with beer and pizza.

Even if this film barely  makes its money back, at least it leaves the  door open for other fantastic ideas in the science  fiction genre. As for the film, the technical side was excellent.  Bowman, a former television director proves  he can do just as well with a 50 million dollar  budget (?) and a tough to sell idea. Both  Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey were  believable as care taking heroes. Their bipolar  dynamic was especially excellent, creating tension  not just in beliefs but also in culture and devotion  to country. McConaughey was especially good  as Van Zant (which was well cast, considering  he is an actual southerner), bringing a role to  his resume which I had never seen.

It shows the very human struggle to survive after they've been knocked from the top of the food chain. It blends medieval mythology with a modern era breathlessly. Definitely an original take on Man vs Dragon. Now to get this straight, this is a film about Humans, not about Dragons. The dragons merely supply the unique reason for the apocalypse. This is a film about the post-apocalypse, not the apocalypse. It's not about skies full of Dragons turning worldwide armed forces into ash on an epic scale. It's not about Dragons setting the world, quite literally, on fire. It's about after all that's happened.Which is a shame this was advertised as a film about Dragons burning all life as we know it. Of course, everyone goes in expecting to see 90 minutes of Dragons destroying everything. If this had been advertised as a more human film about after these Dragons have completely wasted everything, I really think this could've been seen as a good film. It unfortunately set expectations high in the wrong sort of viewers by a mind-blowingly epic trailer.Christian Bale, Gerard Butler and Matthew McConaughey all deliver their role superbly, and the script isn't as bad as it's made out to be either. The effects were great and the Dragons do look pretty realistic, to the point I almost believed this was a documentary. Okay, so there are some plot holes, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to fill those in yourself. I mean, does everything have to be explained so obviously? The only reason this film gets 4 stars and not 5 is because, being a film about human struggle, it could've done with a bit more character development. Other than that, it's a deeply entertaining, well-acted, suspenseful film.Don't knock it before you see it for yourself.

A few bands of people remain here and there trying to survive.  Quinn (Christian Bale, with whiskers and glottal stops), who was on the scene as a boy in London when the first sleeping dragon awakened in a cave unearthed by an Underground project his mum was working on, leads a group of survivors in the north of England who're just trying to get a crop going for the next year and save a little mob of children.  In comes Van Zan (Mathew McConaughey, with shaved head and brawny tattooed arms) leading an American helicopter crew. He's become a dragon slayer and since he's found there's only one male dragon left and it's somewhere around London, he's come to solicit aid.  Quinn refuses.  Van Zan pushes on to London without Quinn.  They fail.  He returns and begs Quinn to come as guide.  What follows is the finale.If you probe too deeply into the premise you're not going to have any fun, but fun is what this movie offers, glorious mindless fun and, above all, fabulous apocalyptic visuals of twisted metal, crepuscular landscapes, dark hulking ruins, and men crawling through them to fire off weapons at the evil birds, which look very graceful as they sweep through the skies and spurt out long expanding streams of fire.  Shots are so stunningly composed you want them to freeze-frame.  Within the dark end-of-the-world light there is amazing clarity. Working with Ridley Scott's cinematographer Adrian Biddle, X-Files director Rob Bowman has produced the best fantasy landscape this year next to `Lord of the Rings.'  When Van Zan leads a hunt in the sky, it's like a computer game, and sometimes we see the game through the eyes of the dragon and it looks like a degraded digital film.  However, it's not ingenuity of conception but sheer aesthetic appeal that makes the visuals of this movie so good.The other large positive factor is the very solid, mostly English cast including a number of appealing youngsters led by Scott James Moutter as Jared, Quinn's adopted son, not to mention Bale, who brings a striking level of naturalness and conviction to his role as the sensitive, conscience-stricken Quinn.  Bale's a foil to McConaughey's American macho militarist icon.  McConaughey, whose finely chiseled face can be seen staring in mirrors in `Thirteen Conversations About One Thing,' is having a lark playing a brute here, but in the moments when he isn't shouting, he gives Van Zan almost as much conviction as Bale gives Quinn.  Ladies are in short supply in this story there's Alex (Izabella Scorupco) as Van Zan's helicopter pilot who winds up with Quinn, and for five minutes there's Alice Krige as young Quinn's mum.  But since this movie's ideal audience might surely be young teenage boys, that's probably enough. Other things are lacking too, such as more variety in the dragons, more recognizable details of the wrecked London of the final scenes, some more colorful characters among Quinn's community, as in post-apocalyptic classics like `Mad Max.'  But to say that is to miss the point, which is that this is a fast, exhilarating ride that's a feast for the eyes.  If you want to view all this as a `B' horror picture, fine just grant that it's a first-class version.  To be seen, by all means, on a big screen, preferably in a big, old-time movie house.

I mean, dragons in the future??However, the previews didn't really say anything about the great acting, touching scenes, and great overall story and concept.  What a surprise this movie was!  Matthew McConnaughy does a great job, and I could only really half-believe it was him through the whole movie!  He plays such an interesting character ... and then the highly rated Christian Bale lives up to his previous acting job... a brilliant performance on his part.I really was impressed with this movie.  It's a wonderful post-apocalyptic movie that explains the demise of the dinosaurs, and brings a whole new element to the evolution and recycling of life on planet Earth.  Everything in this movie was great, and sci-fi fantasy fans, you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!A few complaints though, no nothing too bad really.. just nitpicky 1) a poor directing decision on filming parts of the dragon's eyesight perspective; this kind of technique is shabby, but luckily, it was for only 2 quick shots. 2) They should have explained how the tanks and helicopters get their fuel. 3) The end line was a little silly, something to do with evolution?  Huh? 4) Where did all the female dragons go at the end?  They just seem to dissapear... maybe an extra 2 minute scene there could have helped to explain the final demise of the dragons.Overall, this movie is a winner!  I'd rate it a solid 8/10 or so!  See it!  Finally, a post-apocalypse movie that is original, believeable, and doesn't have Kevin Costner in it!!!

The plot is wacky because of the theory the dinosaurs were killed by dragons.  The actors are perfect for their roles and did a fine job. In London, an underground tunnel digging operation hits a cave containing the long dormant dragons.  This causes the dragons to awake and spread all over the world.  They burn everything in their path.  The Earth is broiled and the dragons formed a dictatorship.  All surviving organisms hide. Quinn is the leader of a small hiding community.  His leadership comes to question when Americans show at their door.  Big, grizzly Van Zan tells his story of being a dragonslayer, and Quinn lets them stay.  Van Zan has a theory that there is only one male and it is living in London.  He wants an army to help him kill the male and save the world. The computer graphics and special effects are awesome.  Some movies have big dragons and little wings that somehow make it fly, but Reign of Fire's dragons have huge wingspan.  The dragons look spectacular.  Van Zan's leap into the dragon is the most exciting part of the movie. I think the director is combining fantasy and future to make the audience think that anything is possible.  Bizarre things are going to happen in the future, but I do not think dragons are going to take over the world.

A group of workers on a new tube tunnel unleash a dragon from it's slumber.  The end result is the destruction of much of the world and massive loss of life.  Twenty years later humans live in small communities trying to survive the best they can as they hope the dragons will eventually starve without human cities to feast on.  Quinn leads one such group until a group of US ex-soldiers turn up, led by Van Zan, who have more of a mind to fight back.To enjoy this film you need to get over two big obstacles.  First of all the poster &#150; it's not for this film, it's for the prequel which I hope they plan to make.  The poster shows dragons over a burning London and lots of helicopters all over the place.  Basically it's a summer FX movie.  However the film itself jumps this destruction and goes straight to the future, only telling us what happened through cheap footage etc.  This is a big step as it's a real downer to not be allowed to see what happens when the dragon is freed &#150; when we had the `2020' caption I was like `what the&#133;..'.  However this can be got over as the second half of the film is very good and has some good effects and good action (even if it never delivers on the poster).The second obstacle is that it's silly and doesn't make sense.  Once you accept that it's full of holes then you can sit back and enjoy it more.  If you watch it and complain about plot holes then you're missing the point.  For example &#150; how come the dragons don't come and attack this fortress regularly, where does all this fuel keep coming from etc etc.  But then again lets not forget that dragons aren't real either!Like I said, the plot takes a while to get going.  It's hard to watch Quinn's group in a damp castle when you know you SHOULD be seeing dragons rip into the world's cities.  However when Van Zan turns up it gets a lot better and the action is good.  The actual climax is also logically very weak but is very exciting and has a real nice touch plot wise.Bale is good and is not as muscley as the Americans.  He actually turned up having not worked out because he assumed that the characters would all be malnourished.  But when he saw McConaughey he decided to bulk up a bit.  McConaughey is really good as the pumped American.  He is a bit OTT but really that's what this sort of film needs.  Support is pretty bland which leaves the dragons.  Sadly the dragons themselves are pretty empty bad guys.  Because we never see them destroy the world their power is never feared.  In later scenes this is done better but they are never more than big monsters (whereas Jurassic Park's monsters had character and threat).Overall it took time to get going and it never lives up to the marketing hype but it's still enjoyable.  Once you get past the two obstacles then you're free to enjoy the second half of the film and a really enjoyable climax.

Once again we have the typical gray-and-khaki hued post-apocalyptic world filled with burnt out cities, roaming bands of grimy-faced survivors, and enough soot, dirt and rust to make the audience feel the need for a shower once they get out of the theatre (in other words, the `Mad Max' look).The apocalypse in this case comes in the form of a race of fire-breathing dragons that are awakened from their millennia-long state of dormancy thanks to a deep-drilling construction project in downtown London.  We are told that these ash-eating dragons hibernate for eons at a time waiting for the earth to replenish itself before embarking on another mission of total bio-global destruction.  This is, in fact, the explanation for the demise of the dinosaurs, though, if this were indeed the case, one might question just how this species managed to so completely avoid leaving any evidence of its existence in the fossil record.  In this kind of movie, it is probably best not to ask questions of this sort and to just go along with the sheer inanity of it all.The first specimen to be unleashed is discovered by a young London lad named Quinn Abercrombie who, 18 years later, has grown up to be the hunky Christian Bale, leader of a group of survivors holed up in a kind of mountainside fortress with very little hope for a future.  That is, of course, until one fateful day when `Dragon Slayer' Denton Van Dan (Matthew McConaughey) makes his sooty-faced appearance.  From then on it becomes a battle of the minds and muscles between these two strong-willed individuals who have decidedly different ideas about how best to ensure the survival of the human race.Movies like `Reign of Fire' pretty much preclude any real critical analysis.   Suffice it to say that the special effects and art direction are quite impressive throughout, the dialogue bland and purely functional, and the performances adequate to the admittedly rather unchallenging task.  And the characters are at least allowed to show their human side at times, displaying various amounts of fear, uncertainty and emotional vulnerability even at those moments when they are having to be at their most daring and heroic.   There is one truly inspired scene in which two of the adults beguile the children by acting out the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader `I am your father' confrontation scene from `The Empire Strikes Back.'  More clever moments like that would have helped make `Reign of Fire' a more distinctive film than it currently is. Oh well, if nothing else, the theatre-shaking soundtrack is enough to keep you awake, if not exactly interested, at all times.   But cranking up the volume is often the first indication that a movie has very little else to offer.

OK, it's a pretty silly concept, but the whole thing is handled with panache. Director Rob (X-Files) Bowman is obviously at home with this kind of subject matter and the visuals are excellent thanks to cinematographer Adrian Biddel, a dab hand at photographing the impossible thanks to his work on the two Mummy films and The World Is Not Enough. Critics here in the UK panned it when it came out, saying that it needed more special effects, but they completely missed out on the charm of the film, which was in the ingenious ways that it showed the human race had been changed by the onset of the dragons.

The story begins in London in 2008, when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who, like most of us, is a little cranky first thing in the morning.  The dragon, oddly, sleeps through the breaching of its den with a massive roaring drilling machine, and only wakes up when it is nudged.  All of a sudden dragons are greeting the dawn all over the world and torching things with more reckless abandon than the U.S. Forest Service.  The world is shortly destroyed, as we learn in a drawn-out opening sequence involving an unseen narrator writing in a journal, though he doesn't seem to be writing what he's saying.  Most of the story takes place in 2020, where a society of refugees led by Quinn (Christian Bale) lives in a decrepit English castle, hiding from the dragons.Things can only get so bad in Europe, of course, before the Americans show up, and show up they do, in an armored column of the Kentucky Irregulars, led by tattooed, bald nut case Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey).  He has a crazy idea that entails killing the boss dragon, since it is the only male dragon of the millions around the globe (must be a busy fella).It's critical in post-apocalypse movies to establish a credible and vivid world, with a balance of the modern and the primitive, and a sense of how societal priorities have changed to suit the new reality.  The classic case was the jury-rigged ingenuity of the Mad Max movies, where V8 engines were prized and gasoline more precious than life.  They weren't necessarily realistic, but they were believable, because they established a set of rules and stuck by them.  Reign of Fire is all out of whack in this department the castle-dwellers are on the brink of starvation, but seem to have a limitless supply of electricity, without even a cursory explanation of where it comes from.  As part of their security net, they use massive searchlights to monitor the night skies.  Uh, way to keep a low profile, guys.  Van Zan's people, on the other hand, apparently have an endless supply of fuel, enough to maintain a gas-guzzling tank and a helicopter(!) with again, no hint of how.  Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons, yet the word radiation never so much as passes anyone's lips.  Plus, the movie can't even keep track of its own timeline.All this could have been forgiven if we got some gut-wrenching army n' dragon smackdowns.  Van Zan is supposed to be a fearsome dragon killer, so you would figure that he and his militia would have some savvy anti-dragon tactics figured out, from the painful lessons learned by the doomed struggle of the world's armies, but no.  When they take on a dragon in the castle environs, their plan of attack is so suicidally ludicrous it would take a minor miracle to work just once.  Without going into too much detail, it involves ground-based radar monitors, a high-tech computer tracking system, and skydivers, all to try and bring the beast to earth so McConaughey can kill it with an axe.  Seriously.The movie has its good points, though it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman, who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension.  The climactic battle is pretty impressive, and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings.  Wolf Kroeger's production design isn't bad, the landscape is suitably scorched and desperate, though it looks like they might have swiped some sets from Enemy at the Gates.  The dragons themselves, of course, are amazing.  They are truly mean hombres of fluid reptilian grace, whose jaws leak flaming liquid as they breathe.  They (almost) convince you that they really could have destroyed the world, that they wouldn't have been swatted from the sky in two seconds by any F-18 pilot with half a brain and a rack of heat-seekers.  But then you expect great effects from even the most dim-witted of movies these days.Like most monster movies, Reign of Fire suffers badly when the monsters are offscreen catching a smoke break, and we are left with flat characters speaking silly dialogue in a tepid story.  Bale is all right, though his character comes off as something of a weenie.  McConaughey, meanwhile, has no chemistry with anyone or anything on screen.  He's a buffed-out paramilitary psycho, but not an interesting one.  You can't figure out how he became the leader (maybe he was the only one who could drive a tank). The most engaging character is Alex, the helicopter pilot, played by Izabella Scorupco (the luminous computer expert in GoldenEye), who isn't given much attention by the script, but who seems like she would have been a better choice to lead the militia.  Too bad she wasn't the main character.But the humans aren't the real stars anyway.  I sort of picture a dragon, guzzling an Evian bottle of lighter fluid, and barking into his cell phoneI'm telling you, Marty, I've had it!  C'mon, I can fly!  I can breathe fire!

I actually didn't even realize it was him until I saw the cast listing here on IMDb and went back to check because I couldn't believe it.Overall this is an excellent film to watch with friends who are fans of any genre. Its dark enough to please people looking for a more frightening film, but light enough to not turn off anyone else. It has action, but no 1 vs 50 gunfights or unrealistic chases and stunts. Sure the film could have been better with a bit more refinement, but I don't think anyone would regret at least watching it once. "},{"Title":"Saw this and Road.

They grabbed the bible as a link to each other, and to their past, with it's legend, and lore and dogma.  Of course in our day and age, the survivors would probably worship harry potter instead of jesus.

And i still wanted to see him.  I sort of just thought of him as a pretty face, but even uglied up he still has a great deal of presence on the screen.  Christian Bale never really fails to delight me.  From All The Little Animals to American Psycho, super sweet to super nasty, he never lets me down.  I'm a little worried about the two here though, they looked like they had been pumped full of steroids.  I had no idea, it was like a pec war between them.  I loved the Dragons.  That is what impressed me the most.  Now at times, it was a little iffy, but much better than SpiderMan, or Jurassic park.  I was scared by these Dragons.  It didn't look like a movie with cartoons filling in the holes.  There is one seen where Quinn comes back to camp on a horse and is surrounded by a whirling sea of glowing embers.That scene is worth the price of admission. A very good movie.  I went with a group of six people.  And we all agreed, (which we never do).  It had suprised us at how good the film was.  Now it won't win any oscars, but if you want to be entertained, run to the cinema.  The line for Perdition will be long. But skip it.

There's no real explanation as to how or why the dragons were hibernating in the London underground and the whole concept doesn't bare up to any close scrutiny . Why weren't nuclear weapons effective against them when a dragon can be killed with a road pick ?

No? Well that's OK because Reign of Fire has it covered. It's set in the year 2020 and the world has been overrun by dragons. The world has been thrown into a post-apocalyptic setting and all the humans have to hide out in the mountains, never going near the cities because of the swarm of dragons that populate those areas. The film centers on a group of refugees led by Quinn (Christian Bale). The refugees live quiet lives in their mountain homes always on the watch for dragons. Things are stirred up, however, when an American group of marauders led by Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey). Van Zan quarrel quite a bit before they realize that only one species is going to survive this apocalypse so they'll have to band together if they want to survive. For what it's worth this is really a pretty damn fun movie.It's always fun to watch some new concept unfold well on screen. This film has a great feel to it and the whole idea of post-apocalyptic meets medieval creatures is great. An entire mythos is built around the dragons and their origins. There are numerous creative elements constructed here, such as a little proverb the children say to themselves every night before they go to bed. It tells them to always keep one eye on the sky and that if they see the monsters they must dig and dig and never look back. We also see a lot of neat military weaponry used to fight the dragons. One really cool example are the Archangels, soldiers who drop from helicopters and capture the dragons in nets, dragging them to the ground. For what it's worth there is some pretty innovative stuff going on in this film.Now I could sit here and nitpick and complain about all the little flaws of this film, but its just not worth it to slam this film because of certain little things. Sure it has some cheesy lines, sure it has its silly moments, sure it some useless scenes, but no one ever said this film was a masterpiece. This isn't Scorsese, this isn't Kubrick, this isn't Tarantino. This is just pure fun with some post apocalyptic dragons thrown in. It's not one of those films you pick apart for every little detail its worth. You simply take it as it is and enjoy it for what it is. And honestly, for a fun little action flick this film does a great job at keeping my attention and entertaining me just enough for that hour and a half.Reign of Fire is plenty entertaining for what its worth. It's not groundbreaking piece of cinema but it serves its purpose and offers something new and original. The film is aesthetically great and conceptually awesome. It is executed very well, despite some flaws. This is in no way a bad film, and its well worth the watch.

Granted, I'm not at all a fan of Matthew McConaughey, but the movie does its job being truly exciting and gritty.I can understand some of the negative critiques and I've spotted a few things, myself. Most of them had to do with the fact that the story felt like it was missing a few parts. A perfect example is when Jared and Quinn (Bale) had a small argument after Quinn got into a fight with Van Zan (McConaughey). It felt like the conflict between the two suddenly came out of nowhere without being built up to anywhere in the story and it seemed to end without any real tension. In fact, the Jared character himself didn't really seem like he actually contributed to the story so the entire scene didn't really seem necessary.Another thing that bugged me a little is that Christian Bale often spoke his lines extremely fast. It was almost as if he wanted to speed through his lines as quickly as possible. And granted, there is a lot of peril so it makes sense he'd want to keep things quick, but it can sometimes get a little annoying.There were still a lot of good things about the movie, though. In my case, I've grown so tired of seeing dragons in movies where they were just small parts of stories like ploys in a giant strategy game. This time, though, they were free-willed predatory animals. That idea excited me. It also excited me that they kept the actual fairytale fantasy to a minimum. In fact, it didn't seem to exist at all. These weren't magical creatures. They were flesh and blood animals and the rules of real life mortality applied. And for me, that makes the entire thing much more plausible- save for maybe the one male dragon idea which seemed to be too close to the alien queen concept from Aliens (1986).The dragon designs were also top notch. To this day, they still remain my favorite designs for any dragons I've seen anywhere in any other movie, game or artwork. The idea of adapting them to a bat-like design- allowing them to retain four limbs- was genius and much more realistic than featuring reptiles with six limbs- the four legs and two wings. The fiery breath was also made very realistic with the idea of chemicals as opposed to something like the fire-lung mentioned in Dragonheart 2 A New Beginning (2000). And for once, the dragons' wings were at a size that could justify lifting such massive animals. In short, I believed these designs.Is this a perfect film? Absolutely not. The editing and screenplay sometimes seem rather sloppy and underdeveloped. But as far as dragon movies go, it's unique, much more realistic and extremely exciting. It's also fast-paced enough that it doesn't over-stay its welcome. It's a real monster movie. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth keeping around.

It stars Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Izabella Scorupco and Gerard Butler. Cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Story is set in Apocalyptic England 2020, and fire breathing dragons rule the skies as mankind threatens to become extinct. But in the North a small community of humans, led by Quinn (Bale), do their best to survive. Into their lives comes Dragon Slayer Denton Van Zan (McConaughey) and his small band of American soldiers, it upsets the equilibrium of the community, but if they can pull together? Then maybe there is hope for mankind to once again thrive&#x85;.It's one of those films that has a reputation, or internet rating, that's difficult to pin down as to how true to form they are. Reign of Fire without a doubt has a premise that's actually better than the film ultimately is. There is scope there for a big budgeted sequel/prequel or certainly for another big summer popcorn blockbuster where dragons rule the Earth. Bowman's film, I believe, was let down badly by the publicity junket that accompanied it. The trailers promised untold delights of dragons fighting mankind, duelling with helicopters and laying siege to man at his most vulnerable. The posters suggested a sky lit up by fire as London comes under attack by a number of winged beasties, the artwork stunning in its presentation. Sadly, as those who have seen the film can attest, neither promise is met, thus expectation levels were never going to be met. So is the low internet rating, and indifferent critical opinions, calling it on its own terms? Entering with a low expectation does help one to enjoy the film more on a first viewing, definitely, but a repeat viewing also improves the film no end on account of just enjoying the look, feel and characterisations at work. Yes we are still hungry for more dragon attacks, in fact just one sequence of an army of dragons attacking would have been nice, but this is still a gritty little fantasy working well within its budgetary restrictions. The lead players are good value, Bale is grizzled and buffed, putting some quality emotional pathos into Quinn in the process, while McConaughey is on full tilt overdrive excess as the battle hardened Van Zan. You can call it ham or cheese if you like, but McConaughey is having a good time, and the film, and its delicious premise, calls for such a fun and blunderbuss character. While Scorupco and Butler hold their respective ends up well enough. There's a lack of depth in the community characters, so a problem there as it renders the film practically a three pronged piece, while as bizarre as it may sound, the dragons too have no background for us to be involved with as they go about their search for human food. What action is here, and there's enough to appease the average thrill seeker, is well put together by Bowman (X-Files film and series). Again it helps to realise the budget afforded the film severely restricts the options, but he does well in the singular dragon/man confrontations, with a great finale between our heroes and old daddy dragon well worth the price of a rental. While one extended sequence involving Ark Angel soldiers free-falling from the sky is an adrenalin fuelled crowd pleaser. The look, too, is good value, where Adrian Biddle washes out the colours from the photography to create the classic apocalyptic look; where this of course then benefits the shots of the dragon's fire breath, scorching the screen to dazzle the eyes. Clearly it could have been better, but it still comes out far better than many other bigger budgeted action/fantasy movies. Set expectation level at medium, or give the film another chance, and you may find it gets in and does a good job of entertaining you for just over an hour and half. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Surprisingly Entertaining..Wow","Date":"3 May 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Wow!

Look at how X-Men and Spiderman consolidated 40 years worth of information into one script as if all aspects of their story lines happened simultaneously. Yet, this MUST be done because movies are not about details. Documentary's are about details. Movies are about STORY, PLOT, CHARACTER. Like a play.

Anyway, I loved the grey burnt out landscape and the 96 minutes of tension that led to a satisfying ending. Yes, this was focused on a pocket of humanity but it is a tale that is neatly placed amongst the heroes who brought about the downfall of the Dragons' Reign on earth. If this story had really happened there would be thousands (millions) of tales that could be told about heroism, cowardice, desperation, etc. The film has to focus on one pocket of humanity to bring us along and make us a care about a handful of characters keeping plot points simple and dramatic.

I don't believe we ever see a dragon EAT a person in the film, they might bite them, but we never see them dropping down and chomping the people. The reason I am thinking for this is because the dragons know they are a threat, take out the threat and then later fry them to ash and eat them. Also, not once did they say that dragons could only eat ash, it simply said they like the ash. The people in the film never fully understand the dragon physiology, I don't know my moviegoers feel they have to have it all explained to them.

That's what I thought anyways after seeing the trailer for Reign of Fire, Rob Bowman's 2002 post- apocalyptic thriller about dragons and the humans that fear them. Christian Bale and Mathew McConaughy, who play the lead roles, went on to have successful careers after this movie.    First off, Rob Bowman deserves substantial credit for agreeing to direct this movie, considering the riskiness of such an endeavor. Bowman, who produced many of the X-Files episodes, was no stranger to the sci-fi thriller genre when he signed onto this. However, the prospect of making a high budget special effects film about the dragon apocalypse must have seemed a little far-fetched. After all, how would a bunch of dragons manage to defeat the world's military and burn the entire surface of the earth to ash? Why couldn't they be stopped? Most importantly though, why dragons of all things? Certainly a unique premise, it appears as though the film did not come together as well as it could have. Reign of Fire does succeed however in creating a great post-apocalyptic atmosphere, which bears significant resemblance to the world seen in the future sequences of James Cameron's Terminator movies. The trench-coat clad gunmen coupled with the burnt out English countryside help to establish a similar feeling of impending doom and gloominess to that of John Conner's future war against the machines. Copious amounts of ash and fog, ever present in the film, help to intensify this effect. Bowman also made a great decision to stray away from the typical Godzilla-style monster movie by sacrificing the over-the-top scenes of carnage that the genre is notorious for in order to leave room for character development.The problem is that the people responsible for this movie forgot to include character development. Perhaps they were too excited about the dragons. Much of the plot revolves around Christian Bale, who plays a thirty something year old English man named Quinn. Quinn, who accidentally woke up the original dragon that started the whole mess, now protects a group of survivors by not wearing his shirt. Sadly, Bale's character is an insult to his talent. Quinn spends much of his time on screen being depressed and shouting at people without having any revealing dialogue.We never really get to learn too much about Quinn however, because Mathew McConaughy shows up about thirty minutes in and steals the show, although you'll wish he hadn't. McConaughy, who inexplicably goes by the name of Van Zan, rides up to Quinn's fort straddling a tank gun and quickly establishes himself as the film's leading source of phallic imagery. A full-bodied yet empty character, Van Zan, or Thrust Meat-Chunk, looks as if he had just stepped out of an Unreal Tournament game. He also claims to be an expert dragon slayer.Somehow, Van Zan, has managed to pilot a huge cargo jet full of American stereotypes over to England to save the day because hey, that's what America does, right? He plans to do so by defeating the original dragon that Quinn unwittingly released at the age of eight. Van intends to accomplish this feat through the use of motorcycles and a helicopter. Unfortunately, Van Slam-Chest quickly proves himself to be one of the most incompetent action heroes in film history, leading one to wonder how he's survived so long without being eaten. Van's habit of knowing nearly everything about the dragons leads one to doubt whether or not the film-makers knew how to resolve the movie.By the end of the film, the audience will likely be rooting for Van Zan's death and wondering why it hadn't come earlier. Essentially, it's McConaughy's character who ruins Reign of Fire, which otherwise may have been a decent sci-fi thriller. While Van appears to have good intentions, his arrogance and destructive nature prevent him from being a suitable protagonist.Despite Van Man's excessive screen time, Reign of Fire does contain some redeeming qualities. In particular, it does a good job of capturing humanity's pitiful state in the post industrial era. Most notable is the the light saber duel that Quinn and his friend put on in the decaying church for the children's amusement. It is moving to see the adult generation's efforts to preserve the culture of a bygone age of human history. Overall though, Reign of Fire fails to be a successful thriller. The moderate special effects do not make up for the fact that this film lacks the exciting action sequences, quirky dialogue and fun character's that define its genre.

I am a HUGE fan of Christian Bale, Mathew McC, and Gerard Butler, and seeing the three of them together in leading roles in one movie was a treat. This movie delivers excellent lines, acting, and some amazing very scary dragon special effects, not sure why people are calling this 'low budget'.The movie tells the tale of a near future England where sleeping dragons have been released from an ancient tomb. They quickly multiply and overwhelm human military capabilities, and we are soon in a doomsday world where humans scrounge beneath the earth for survival while dragons rule the skies and the world above. Enter Matthew McConaughey as tough talking former US army commander leading a rag-tag unit of dragon hunters, to teach the limeys how to fight again.Which leads me to this movie's major downfall STORY AND PLOT HAVE HOLES THE SIZE OF DRAGONS IN THEM...Story and Plot are sadly lacking in this movie, which is otherwise brilliantly acted and brilliantly filmed. The tired old story of the US coming to Britain's rescue was done in WW2, and rather insulting nowadays. Gerard Butler dies one of the most useless and hilarious deaths in film, walking upstairs to confront an elder male dragon with a fire extinguisher (I AM NOT KIDDING). OMG....Matthew McConaughey has a rather childish hissy fit when the English decide to throw a victory party for their first group dragon kill, as some of the Americans got killed... kinda silly.And the solution to all their problems is simply to kill the one male dragon... uh, what if another male hatches? Wouldn't the dragon 'species' have a solution to that??? Other than these truly dragon-sized plot holes, the movie delivers a gritty doomsday flick about dragon fighting. Not quite up to the epic and still undefeatable DRAGON SLAYER, but a worthy addition to the Dragon Movies overall.With a bit more cash and a bit more attention to plot and story, this could have truly been an epic movie.

Young Ben Thornton survives but his mother is one of many killed by the dragon's first blast of fire.Fast forward about thirty years and Thornton, now Christian Bale is leader of a small colony in rural Great Britain if in fact such a government still exists.

I have to say Izabella fills a flight suit out real nice.The best things about Reign Of Fire are the sets showing the burned over world the dragons have left. So incredibly bleak, they make the sets of Mel Gibson's Mad Max films look like the Everglades.

Imagine Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) rolled up with George Miller's The Road Warrior Mad Max 2 (1981), and you'll have a good idea what transpires in the atmospheric Reign of Fire. The comparison with Jaws is inevitable, because director Richard D. Zanuck, who produced Jaws, serves as one of the Reign of Fire producers. Suspensefully helmed by Rob Bowman, who directed the 1998 big-screen X-Files movie, Reign of Fire treats its subject matter with surprising sobriety, deliberately shunning humor for the most part, while forging an inventive but formulaic man versus giant monster melodrama. Freshman scribes Gregg Chabot and Kevin Peterka, alongside Halloween H20 writer Matt Greenberg, have give dragon movies a new lease-on-life by grafting them onto futuristic science fiction fare.Reign of Fire opens in contemporary London as a British construction crew excavating earth for a new subway tunnel drills off into a subterranean void. Intrepid young Quinn&#151;son of the project engineer&#151;takes a flashlight and explores this dark cavern, while the workers scratch their heads in mystery. Initially, when he lays his hands on the cavern walls, Quinn doesn't realize that he has just awakened a sleeping dragon. Suddenly, an arc of fire illuminates the gloomy void, and Quinn turns to see a dragon as it rears its ugly, scaly head. Quinn escapes from the tunnel in an elevator, but his divorced mother/project engineer, Karen Abercromby (Alice Krige of Star Trek First Contact), dies in a spectacular blaze when the dragon all but cremates the construction site. This legendary beast flies off and spawns millions of dragons. According to the screenplay, dragons originally decimated the dinosaurs and turned the Earth into little more than smoke and ashes before going into hibernation with their appetites assuaged for several centuries.Twenty years later, in 2020 A.D., after these flying, fire-breathing reptiles have laid waste to the planet again, an adult Quinn (Christian Bale of American Psycho) has emerged as leader of a small community of survivors in the ruins of a Northumbian castle. Discontent erupts against Quinn's rule when a starving few demand to harvest their produce ahead of schedule. Dragons prowl the skies twenty-four-seven, and they have grown especially ravenous, since they now outnumber human beings. Just as Quinn has all but lost faith in mankind and himself, up roars battle-hardened tough guy Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey of U-571) in a tank at the head of a convoy of a helicopter flown by Alex (Izabella Scorupco of GoldenEye) bringing up the rear. Van Zan and Quinn clash at first, but eventually they team up to take on these terrifying dragons. People that complain that Hollywood churns out the same old stuff every summer may find Reign of Terror a refreshing departure from the norm.

This is a a beautifully atmospheric post-apocalyptic fantasy flick. You'll probably wish to see more of the dragon(s), but when it is flash bang on screen it's worth the money. The fact that one rarely gets a good look at it before the big finale makes it all the more menacing.The editors used color grading to enhance the dramatic effect, so everything before the climax is shaded either dirty-gray or fiery-red - and there is a lot of fire, as the title suggests. A bald Matthew McConaughey riding a tank with the barrel sticking up between his legs is a memorable image, while the scene that has Quinn and Creedy reenact the highlights of Star Wars for their custodial children is virtually unforgettable. A funny mixture of English dialects one rarely gets to hear on film adds a flavor for non-native speakers with a taste for the original.There is a lot of subtle drama and good acting on screen, especially for an action movie. McConaughey has the only cartoon character role, but that's what he does best. The creators used every bit they could tell a story with, from the paintings and sketches on the medieval castle's walls to the faces of the children. So sometimes it feels like a mixture of The Name of the Rose and The Lord of the Rings with a comic book, but the mixture is truly original.The film has its (commercial) shortcomings, mainly that the big action scenes are too sparse, and what is there looks too minimalistic for fans of (expensive) Bruce Willis-style overkill. Some CGI flyover scenes would have established a better sense of time and place. On the other hand, the notion of fantasy creatures taking over requires a stretch of the mind. The story focuses on the struggle of a tiny group of survivors, and the battles of the rest of the world show up only as news flashes in the prologue. The split between drama and nitty-gritty action, fantasy and realism is maybe what distinguishes it above the average. And there is the stunning visual beauty of the images. It's definitely not going to gather dust on my shelf, but be watched again from time to time.

My one complaint with this film is that it was shot so dark that it is hard to see a lot of the action. The novel idea of one male for all of the female dragons is an excellent one however. Much of the look of the dragons tends to remind one of the 1997 version of Godzilla, with the lairs of creatures underground.

Instead, we skip most of that and go right to the after effects. So the story moves at a steady clip without sacrificing too much character development.The movie really didn't get its due in the theaters. But that only means that you can pick the DVD up at a very reasonable price almost anywhere. It is perfectly safe for teenagers to watch along with their parents ... and a nice bucket of popcorn, of course.Go for it ... you won't be sorry.

I thought Reign of Fire was brilliant great action, spectacular effects, a decent (if farfetched) plot, well realised characters and fantastic sets & scenery. The makers of this movie spent a lot of time researching various animals (snakes, bats etc.) to make their dragons more believable - and it shows. To me, this is the best vision of a dragon I have seen in any movie, even better than in Dragonlslayer or Dragonheart. Also, I found the post apocalyptic society presented in the movie very believable, complete with cultural references to the before-time. I emapthised with the characters, and felt all in the movie did a very good acting job. One warning though don't be misled by the trailers, this movie doesn't actually feature all that much modern weaponry vs. dragons action; it is a limited to a few short battles. The only other nit-pick I had was the solution our heroes come up with for the dragon problem - without giving too much away, I will say it was a pretty far stretch of the imagination to accept the facts presented which open the door for a final victory. All in all a very good movie, especially if you are a fan of dragons, or man vs. beast movies.

The film itself has great possibilities, however, it does not live up to them. I will try to review this film without giving away too much. The dragons lack any real personality, the Van Zandt character is about as 1-dimensional as they come, and the dragons, the stars of the film, are hardly there. Too much of this film is spent on back-story, and yet the plot as many holes in it as Jurassic Park III. For example, the working theory is that the dragons appear every so often in history, the most recent event was their killing off of the dinosaurs and caused the ice age. Fine, except for two huge problems. First, the dinosaurs died a few million years before the ice age, and second, the only real source of modern-day dragon lore comes from the Middle Ages, which they completely ignore. There are may others that stand out, but I will not spoil the film for everyone else. Go and enjoy it, but don't expect a landmark in dragon lore.

Always an intriguing mythological creature, the dragon makes its comeback into American cinema without most of the camp stigma associated with their previous appearances in other cheesy sci-fi films.Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale carry the post-apocalyptic testosterone film well and find ways of making dragon slaying seem exciting. The creatures look pretty good for the most part, but every once in a while seems a little over-the-top. With the Jurassic Park-style technology, it's the right time to try a movie like this.You should be able to tell from the preview if this is something you'll enjoy or not.

Reign of Fire has the same advantage over its peer-group this year.Basic story (no spoilers here) Boy is witness to the onset of a catastrophic unleashing of a dragon-like being on Earth, and as an adult 20 years later (Christian Bale)is the mayor of a post-apocalyptic survivalist community in the rugged north of England. They're just hanging on against a plague of dragons in an ash-laden landscape, holed up in a castle, when Matthew McConnaughy shows up with a surprisingly well-equipped military unit. Action, cultural conflicts, dragon-fighting and plausible-enough scientific explanations ensue.The sets are great, the acting good to great, the script makes sense (which is kind of amazing to me...all the writers are imdb-listed as only having done TV, and this suffers from none of TV's dumbing-down or wierd commercial-every-eight-minutes pacing), and has some references to both Wuthering Heights and Moby Dick. The special effects are so-so (another similarity to those mid-1950s Brit sci-fi gems because it was the plots and dialogue that were the crux, not the fx).The last ten minutes are a mite too fast and too predictable, but that barely sullies the overall quality of this clever, tight, entertaining, never-boring-for-a-minute film.The first action film of the summer not aimed directly at 13-year-old-boys-and-to-heck-with-everyrone-else. In fact, if Joe Bob Briggs and Charlotte Bronte dated, they'd both come out of the theatre content.

If there is one thing that this movie lacks, it is scope. Even with a setting in the English countryside, the film feels claustrophobic and uncomfortably tight. The legend of the dragons is even breezed by and not realized into the large story that it is but only alluded to with mock up newspaper articles and publications.

The story takes place in England, circa 2010-2020 A.D., in a world that has been virtually destroyed by a species of fire-breathing dragons.   Survivors band together for self-preservation, except Van Zan (McConaughey) and his followers, who are intent upon slaying the dragons and freeing the world from their 'reign of fire'.  McConaughey is, by the way, remarkably 'tough' in this film.  He and European co-stars Christian Bale, Izabella Scorupco and Gerard Butler all offer good performances.Visually, the movie is often powerful, although the quality of the special effects varies widely from scene-to-scene.  In some, the dragons look amazingly realistic and scary, while in others they appear a bit fake and unconvincing.  Several scenes, though, are totally awesome and, overall, 'Reign' delivers a heaping helping of thrills, chills and heart-pounding fun.The plot has a few warts, of course.  For example, where did Van Zan and his crew gas up their helicopter and tanks?  Hmmm.  Oh well, this is a 'fantasy' and doesn't necessarily need to make sense.  The dragons are nasty enough and, if you love a good monster flick as much as I do, it's well worth seeing!

To tell the truth I could have gone even longer without seeing it as the competently made, well-budgeted Reign of Fire was slightly entertaining, but disappointedly an unspectacular post-apocalyptic action feature. I just didn't think it gave you all that much bang for your buck. The atmospheric sound effects are earth-shaking and the special effects while impressive weren't particularly exciting and this goes for the set-pieces. Outside one or two stunning sequences (one involving sky-diving), it's all smoke with little fire and intensity cobbled together with a thin plot and makeshift characters. While short-lived and precise, not much really occurs within the framework until the dying stages. Director Rob Bowman slickly crafts an effectively forlorn and dour wasteland setting burned to the crisp, but his basic story-telling lacks the power and imagination. The acting is reasonable. Christian Bale goes about things in a stark manner and Matthew McConaughey chips in with a meaty performance. The tension is fuelled mainly by these two character's battling out with their egos to who's really in control and knows best for the situation they find themselves in.

Now that must break some rules somewhere...) Karen (Alice Krige). While there one of the workers finds an underground cavern as he drills & sends Quinn inside with a torch to have a look (again this doesn't seem like these people are following proper safety procedures, does it?) where he sees a huge fire-breathing Dragon who toasts everyone down there except Quinn who makes it out alive, just. It's now '2020 A.D.' & Dragons have all but destroyed the entire Earth, only a few small groups of humans survive. One such group is lead by the now adult Quinn (Christian Bale), life is hard as food is scarce, in fighting is rife & the constant threat of a Dragon attack is obviously worrying. One day a troop of American soldiers lead by Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) pulls up outside their camp & ask for shelter which Quinn eventually agrees to. Van Zan reveals he is on a mission that he hopes will bring about the extinction of the Dragon & needs men to go with him & his soldiers, after various attacks by Dragons most of Van Zan's soldiers are wiped out as is Quinn's camp, together with helicopter pilot Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco) Quinn & Van Zan set off for London for one last attempt to save the human race...Directed by Rob Bowman I thought Reign of Fire was a perfectly acceptable big budget Hollywood fantasy/horror/action film but felt a little empty & soulless. The script by Gregg Chabot, Kevin Peterka & Matt Greenberg moves along at a reasonable pace & never becomes overly boring but the story never really engaged or gripped me, I just sort of sat there watching Reign of Fire & admiring it's fantastic CGI Dragon effects but not being that interested in anything else, I was also constantly asking where these soldiers got all the fuel for their tanks & even a helicopter no less! I only finished watching it a few hours ago & I really can't remember that much about it which is never a good sign. It takes itself with deadly seriousness & some of the macho dialogue & posturing between Quinn & Van Zan particularly when they first meet is just embarrassing to sit through. The notion that millions of Dragons were created by one male is a bit absurd, & why did no one figure out the solution before Van Zan? Also at the start only the male Dragon was discovered so where did the first female come from for him to mate with? Then again it's just a film & maybe I'm thinking about it too much... Another problem I have with Reign of Fire is it's look, I found it an extremely unappealing film to sit through as Bowman films everything outside with a dull grey ash colour for obvious reasons & when inside he films with a warm yellow glow as everything is mean to be lit by candles. I'm all for certain colour schemes, experimentation & variation but I just found Reign of Fire an incredibly dull & visually unexciting film. Director Bowman creates some good action sequences & there is a definite gritty realistic atmosphere throughout. With a supposed budget of $95,000,000 technically Reign of Fire is top-notch & has that Hollywood polish about it as you would expect. The production design & sets are very good but the star of the show are the wonderful CGI Dragon effects, although used sparingly they impress throughout. One thing I will say is the Dragon design in Reign of Fire looks almost identical to the Dragon in Dragonslayer (1981) which isn't a bad thing as such but they just look very similar. The violence is restrained & there is no blood or gore to be found so don't worry about that, there are a few uses of bad language though so maybe it's not suitable for all ages. The acting is OK considering the material. Reign of Fire is a decent watch, I didn't love it but at the same time I didn't hate it either. I will have to sit on the fence a little bit here & say it's probably no more than average with some great Dragon scenes but offset by a couple of plot holes which still bug me even now.

Instead of nuclear war, zombies or ice age we have dragons to blame for pushing humanity back to medieval times. Points for originality, if nothing else.Not to say the film is nothing more than its idea. As stated, the leading actors are all very good and play their roles believably. Bale and McConaughey are especially great in their shared scenes. Two strong-willed leaders putting heads together is always interesting, especially when the two of them are played by such powerhouse actors. It's also good character writing that both of them are quite similar in basic nature yet totally different as leaders. Bale's Quinn is the leader of ordinary men and women. He's cares more about their survival than fighting, whereas McConaughey's Van Zan is a soldier, born and bread, leading a group of soldiers.Where the film falters, unfortunately, is the story. The idea is interesting. The end result of that idea, not so much so. It's your typical bleak and sooty aftermath with bitter survivors, starving children and lots of backstabbing. Van Zam's soldiers gives us a bit of colour and character, but they end up being perhaps a bit too outlandish for them to be completely believable. Quinn's backstory is also a bit too convenient for the film's purposes, which causes the viewer to become disillusioned.In the end I liked this film. Its idea is a lot of fun and if you've ever wanted to see modern military fight dragons, this is about as close as you're going to get. For what it is, it works, but a masterpiece it is not.

In changing from tension to action you as the viewer really want to see things cranked up with a series of battles culminating into a massive war for the survival of mankind.... This however does not appear and a plot shortcut keeps things low key and underdone near the end. It promises much then cranks up the tempo and it seems to run out of either time, money or effort.

However, I didn't let them put me off and in the end I was glad.Yes, there are gaping plot holes, mucho macho posturing, corny dialogue and less screen time for the dragons than you were led to believe by the trailers, however, the hour and a half zipped by quickly. Belief was very much suspended, after all it was a film about dragons taking over the worrrlldddd. The sets and effects were superb, a labour of love I suspect, though inevitably they tend to dominate as charactarisation is swept away in CGI enhanced, fire-breathing frenzy.Now to the dragons (or lack of them). Both realistic and menacing, they fit into the post-apocalyptic landscape perfectly. As for time on screen, perhaps a little bit more, yes, but I thought whenever any character stepped outside of the castle, the director managed to convey the dragon's latent threat extremely adeptly. Too many of these creatures chasing humans around may have led to another Aliens clone.On the whole, a very enjoyable, post-apocalyptic, dragon-infested romp. 7/10  "},{"Title":"I love the smell of Napalm in the morning","Date":"30 January 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  I would say this was a colossal waste of time and money but I with all it's flaws I still found it fun.

(2) Christian Bale did pretty good as the main scarred survivor. (3) The scene with the dragon attacking the castle was very poetic. (4) There was a tinge of a medieval mentality going through this film. (5) The mixture of recent, old-fashioned, and ancient weaponry fit together perfectly to give an idea of how combat flying, fire-breathing reptiles. (6) The Brits and The Americans fighting amongst themselves showed that cultural differences will breed a bunch of dissent and angst in situations where survival is at stake. (7) Amongst the Brits, differing views of survival were seen. Seven reasons gives a score of seven.The downers in the film were (1) Matthew McConaughey as the tooth and nail American commander. He doesn't strike me as the tooth and nail type (watch The Wedding Planner and you'll understand). (2) The Americans are portrayed as if they are a bunch of marauders. Stereotyping anything sucks and it should be stopped. (3) The story had gaping plot holes and lots of tedious dialogue. The writing overall was lacking in many spots.

Given that it has an M rating (PG-13 in the US) they were limited in what they could do, but I still found it appealing and quite satisfactory. I do think that it's set too close in the future, but they made a realistic post holocaust movie.

Twenty years later, after the dragons have spawned and reduced most of the earth to rubble, Quinn and a handful of survivors have taken refuge in a castle in Northumberland. They have a life of caution and hiding until Denton Van Zan, an impulsive militia leader and his troop of Dragon Slayers arrive.  With the help of the Slayers, Quinn and his people finally have a chance to reclaim the earth.

When I heard about it I was very excited. When I saw the poster, I was even more enthusiastic. When I saw the film, I was terribly disappointed.The poster was the start of it. It clearly depicted an Apache helicopter and a dragon in the same bit of sky. In the film, there are plenty of dragons, but not one Apache. Just one lame average chopper. My hopes of an aerial dogfight between an Apache and a dragon went unfulfilled. And I think that's why I was disappointed. After that, it wasn't hard to pick holes in the film.For a start, we're led to believe that the big male dragon in the film is the one released by construction workers from beneath London. The first dragon, so to speak. But we're also told how all other dragons are female. So where did they come from? Did the male dragon dig them out? And how did the dragon/s get buried beneath the earth in the first place? Did they bury themselves? Or was it a bunch of mediaeval knights that did it? How did they survive underground?Then there's the dragons themselves. Apparently they eat ash, which is why they burn everything in sight. I'm no nutritionist, but I doubt ash has enough energy value to sustain something that's 30 feet long, even if it didn't fly. And there's the fire breathing aspect, which we're told is the result of two glands which produce chemicals which react with each other to produce fire. I can accept that, but if so, all dragons should produce fire that is equally intense. But the male dragon's fire is clearly hotter and more intense than the others. In a pure fantasy setting, we can suspend disbelief and believe in dragons without knowing anything about them, but when you mix genres, like they have here, and then try and explain things in a half-hearted way, it just ends up with you thinking Hang on a minute, that's not right...There is also the army, which apparently doesn't have concerns such as where its next tank of fuel comes from.Then there's the all dragons are female, except for the one big male. If it was as easy as killing one dragon (which the american army can kill without too much effort), how in hell did the world get destroyed in the first place?All in all, a film which missed out on being a real stonker of a film and ended up being a real stinker.

Along comes American Matthew McConnaughey and his band of soldiers turned dragon slayers to even up the odds.  It's unfortunate the movie's premise never gels into the rollicking all-out man vs. dragon battle to the death you expect, but there are a lot of things to enjoy.  Rob Bowman's direction is above average, Bale and McConnaughey deliver strong performances, the dragon effects are excellent, and the action scenes we do get are first-rate (three fight scenes in all, adding up to maybe fifteen minutes).

Well, get ready to change your view of these ancient creatures.Dragons, the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs, have been in slumber for centuries.  (As a previous review pointed out, why no fossel record of them is just one of several major plot holes that I see in the story.) With the reawakening of the only male of the species, all hell breaks loose on earth.  Dragons, we learn, live on ash, and produce fire by secreting liquid from two glands in their mouth.  When these two liquids mix, you have instant napalm which is then ejected from the dragon's mouth.  Within 10 years, humanity is reduced to small pockets fighting to survive as the onslaught of the dragons continue.In this setting, we find Christian Bale leading a group of adults and children in a run down castle stuck out in the middle of nowhere.  (Maybe it's just me, but if I was afraid of being attacked by creatures that ruled the sky, why keep myself and my people holed up in a castle with no real defenses?  And what's with the garden being so far away from the castle?) Into the delicate balance that Bale has formed with his people marched Matthew McConaughey.  Gone are his golden locks and good-boy looks from pervious films.  This McConaughey is dark, buffed, shaved head, and covered in tatoos.  McConaughey plays a US citizen who leads a group of dragon fighters who managed to get a plane across the Atlantic and landed in a field nearby Bale's castle.  Their goal is to get to London to destroy the one male that is populating the species (more on this later).Other than the incredible dragon effects, the weight of the story is strongest when you view the interaction between Bale and McConaughey. Both are leaders but both have different styles of leadership.  Bale is leader by default.  He is rather uncharasmatic and leads simply because no one else seems to want the job.  McConaughey leads by example, and by his own inner fire to see the beasts totally destroyed.  During their interaction, we see some signs of story growth.  After McConaughey's team has been destroyed by a dragon attack, he is left with just himself, his pilot and Bale to sneak into London, find the big Bull, and destroy it.  They have one axe, three crossbows, three arrows, and a couple of rifles.  With an obvious blue screen attack, McConaughey gets eaten by the dragon early in the fight. This leaves Bale to finish him off.  With the great Bull dragon dead, the species will die out.The focus of the dialogue between McConaughey and Bale is on leadership...which has the best plan for the future of their peoples and how to merge them into one strong group.  Since both leaders loose most of their followers in two different dragon attacks, the question of which leadership type if best is left unanswered.  One could argue that Bale's was the best since he survied the attach, but this argument falls when one remembers how McConaughey died.Plot holes involving the dragons are abundant.  For example, McConaughey believes that the dragons reproduce in the same way as fish.  The female lays eggs and they are fertalized by the one male.  However, this view is contradicted by Bale when he pulls out a dragon egg from a dead female and inside the egg is a dragon embryo.  Bale never bothers to share this information with McConaughey.  Why?Also, the theory that only one male is populating the species does not have much weight when you consider one question...how does this one male keep other males from being born?  If you say that female dragons can only have female babies, then where did the one male come from?  To spend so much time on developing the relationship between the two major characters, and such expense in developing the dragons, to not answer these basic questions makes the movie empty.As a character study in leadership, see the film.

I consider myself as a person who is quite a fan of the dragon thing I find those mythological creatures very frightening and interesting at the same time, and we don't have to forget that it's one of the mythologies that exists around the world, from Europe to China. Anyway, back to the review. Reign of Fire happens in England, the year 2020 AD, and the Earth has been completely destroyed by hundreds of gigantic fire-breathing dragons. The human survivors hide in fortresses with deep tunnels to shelter from the flying menace. One of those survivor communities is lead by Quinn (Christian Bale), who is the responsible of this dragon incident.Then, a group of americans (lead by Van Zan -Matthew McConaughey-)armed with tanks arrived to Quinn's fortress and proposes to hunt the dragons and finish the nightmare.As you can see, Reign of Fire combines the post-apocalyptic genre (like Mad Max) and dragons, and with success. The film is pure entertainment, a bit B-Series in some moments, but the acting is incredibly great( Bale and McGonaughey fit perfect in respective characters), and the dragons are brilliantly created, very good CGI and sound effects. Those are the two things that make Reign of Fire a very entertaining movie.Does it have flaws? Of course. ^_^ Sometimes, the action slow down, and you could also find the film quite repetitive after an hour.

So one moment, Van Zan tells Quinn that there's one male dragon which impregnates all the females (so, all the other dragons are females ). Okay, if THAT male was the one that Quinn discovered, how can there be an army of dragons??? He can't have possibly laid an egg or so? That's a suitable theory for sci-fi classics as the Alien Saga, but DRAGONS? I suppose if is was a FEMALE, it might have been believable, yet, she would have to carry impregnated eggs, thus, eggs containing DRAGON EMBRYOS.

A plague of dragons in a future, post-apocalyptic England? Sounded far-fetched, and indeed it is, but the good news is that, once the premise is presented in the movie (with clever touches like the dragons being responsible for the mysterious mass-extinction of dinosaurs), it also begins to sound like tremendous fun. Also the visual idea in the poster, with swarms of fire-breathing dragons fighting against formations of military helicopters, looked like the movie could have cracking action sequences. (I enjoyed Godzilla a lot, you know)But sadly, the film doesn't live up to this expectation. Bowman keeps things quite grim and low-key throughout, which works at first, when the tension is building, but ends being disappointing somewhat. The effects and the final battle are more or less satisfying, but it is inevitable to feel that this idea had potential for a much bigger, bolder, and more entertaining film. There is just ONE helicopter, for chrissakes. The impression is that the movie probably suffered budgetary constraints which kept it from realizing its full potential. That's why I say This movie needs a sequel. The idea is just too good. It's a bit like the first Mad Max; it was an interesting film, but it wasn't until the sequel (The Road Warrior for yanks, plain Mad Max 2 for us Europeans, but I think most will agree that it is better than the original) that the concept was explored to its enormously fun extremes.

One of these bands is led by Quinn (Christian Bale). Food is running low and he's only barely managing to keep it together. when along comes a group of American fighters, led by Van Zan (a very beefed up Matthew McConaughey). He wants to take out the dragons. but is this a great plan or the ideas of a mad man?You don't expect much from a movie like this so I was not really that disappointed. The script here. is passable. The reason for the dragon's existence is never revealed nor does it need to be - I was happy to accept the scenario. There've been some complaints about the pacing of the movie, with a leaden middle section. This is somewhat true - the movie contained less action than I might have expected and the characters are not quite strong enough, nor the dialogue, to push it along. It's all a bit contrived but, as I did not expect intelligence. I did not feel let down when I did not get it (although a pleasant surprise would have been good). The climatic ending. is a decent action piece. Most of the action pieces are fairly accomplished, with enough tension to get you involved (even if the outcome, and the `who loves, who dies' is quite predictable).Acting. is nothing amazing. I did not find Bale's accent quite as jarring as other reviewers seem to have but I did not feel it was especially brilliant either. He's not got much of a character to work with here, like he did in `American Psycho' and instead it's the more cardboard cut-out action guy (trying to add dimension via a few moments of brooding). McConaughey seems to have more fun in his role as swaggering, beefy hardcore-military man - you just know he wants to have a cigar clasped between his lips. All the rest are too dimensionless to register with you (including the love interest, Alex, via Izabella Scorupco) but hey - I never expected any more.The SFX generally hold up well and the fire breathing scenes do not appear to be the stream of computer bytes that they actually are. Director Rob Bowman directs these action sequences well, with enough edginess (from his work on `The X-Files') to make you sit up on your seat. He doesn't attempt anything outside of his skill, but perhaps should have attempted some more judicious editing in certain areas (such as pointless `character building' moments). Still I've no complaints with him otherwise, and he makes nice use of the Irish location and the tools he's presented with.`Reign of Fire' should be taken with a pinch of salt and a laid-back attitude.

This isn't just a movie about how dragons bring about the destruction of the planet. It is also about how mankind has suffered as a result of the devestation brought on by these creatures, and how crucial it is that the survivors learn to work as a team if they are to take back the Earth that was stolen from them by the beast.

He wanted to present audiences with something that was realistic, something that would ground them in reality. He hopes that by displaying the characters as real people dealing with real problems, and then revealing that it's because of the dragons, the people in the audience will be as afraid as the characters are. The opening scene of the film is set in present day London. Twelve-year-old English lad, Quinn, while exploring his mother's construction site, awakens a fire-breathing, gargantuan dragon, that, unbeknownst to the world, has been asleep below the surface for many hundreds of years. Twenty-years later, mankind has been brought to its knees by the dragon's many offspring.

Bowman says, The thing about Quinn is that even if he does take a defensive position, he's not weak about it. He is one of the last few people alive out of six billion, so there has got to be something special about him. Hope comes along in the form of a gung-ho American named Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), a man who tells Quinn that he is a dragonslayer. He and his men come to Quinn because they are in need of new recruits for a mission. They are on this mission to find the one and only male dragon that Van Zan believes to be source of fertilization for all the other female dragons. The dragon that they have been searching for is in London. This is the same dragon that Quinn had seen twenty years ago when it had killed his mother. Quinn believes that Van Zan is insane and that this plan of his isn't going to work. However, after he is forced to confront that inner demon that has plagued him ever since his mother's tragic demise, he changes his mind and decides that the time has come to fight back and destroy the creature, once and for all. Probably the most appealing thing about the movie is its originality. When was the last time you saw an action movie where dragons were matched against modern artillery? Never. The only action film (that I can recall) that took place in modern times with a creature that was anything dragon-like was GODZILLA. Thank god this film wasn't made by the same people who produced that piece of garbage. Despite what the film might lack script-wise and in character development, it more than makes up for with its superb blend of exciting action and amazing effects. Popcorn-movie buffs who get thrills from such slam-bang, tough-guy actioners as WATERWORLD and MAD MAX won't want to miss a single minute of this tally-ho, action-packed hit that producer Gary Barber claims is like nothing you've ever seen before.

Christian Bale plays Quinn, leader of a community who may be the last of the human race. They eventually meet the American military led by Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) who has managed to slay some of the dragons with his expert crew. Conflict arises between Quinn and Van Zan in establishing how to defeat the race of dragons, but both must eventually work together.This is a fairly decent action film, with very nice cinematography and some well-executed action sequences. What is really impressive about this this film are the two lead characters and the actors who play them. Matthew McConaughey is almost unrecognisable as the mean shaven-headed Van Zan who is a tough as nails. Christian Bale performs well playing the conflicted Quinn, who will do anything to save his people. When Quinn and Van Zan go head to head, it is a fiery scene and played well by both actors. Izabella Scorupco (I last saw her in Goldeneye) is okay, but doesn't really add that much and has a forgettable character.Unfortunately, with the exception of McConaughey, Bale and some of the effects, the plot is really bad and full of predictable outcomes. The expository dialogue is in full force as the hero seemingly find an easily solution to the problem, that of course fully relates to Quinn's inner turmoil. *SPOILER* For instance, to kill the entire species the rule the earth off- our heros must target the one male dragon which happens to be the sole gender of that species. A little too easy, after-all, the entire world has been taken over by dragons. *END SPOILER* Things like that just seem a little too contrived for my liking, plus there was other scenes just as contrived rather than going out for a realistic science-fiction fantasy crossbreed, and also there is a few plot-holes! However, there is a clever scene with a film reference which I won't spoil, but it adds to the desolate futuristic atmosphere of life after society has been destroyed. Oh, and another thing- these dragons look cool but they are not scary. Not scary at all! And Bowman doesn't quite manage to create the fear involved in this kind of future. Let's hope they don't make a sequel, cause 'Reign of Fire' is not bad on it's own but certainly unsatisfactory in parts and in the overall plot- which lowers it's overall score. Just above average and worthwhile popcorn entertainment! *** out of *****!

And other times you just want to see dragons eating people.Reign of Fire falls very solidly into the brainless action film. Parts of the film make sense and there are some very cute moments watching a post-apocalyptical society struggle to survive against terrifying odds. Other parts of the film make no sense at all and there are plot holes big enough to drive a tank through. The quality of the acting is very good with all of the characters looking and behaving like they belong in a ruined world - Christian Bale does a particularly good job. It is also good to see an action film where the heroes are outgunned and outnumbered from the very start (and know it) rather than being able to beat the snot out of anything that comes their way.The mad science aspects of the film (where the characters try to explain what is happening) is pretty weak, but then it is mad science. I mean, if you put enough scientific-sounding words in an explanation it is bound to make some kind of sense, right? But then again, you don't go to Reign of Fire for a science lesson - you go there to be entertained. It has been a while since dragons have been up on the big screen and it is good to see them back and wreaking havoc.So turn your brain off and enjoy a slightly different type of action movie. It won't win any awards, but it is original enough to stand out from the spy theme that dominate recent action movies.

Aw man, that would have been really cool.Unfortunately for Christian Bale, the dragons that come back to life here are more like the ones in 'Dragon Slayer'. Now as you would expect, that doesn't bode well for mankind, and everything kind of goes wrong. Most of the planet is scorched by dragon flame and we end up living in a horrible, grey burned world. On the plus side, there aren't any mimes, and there's no evidence of pyramid selling schemes. But the cons generally outweigh the pros.Now, Mr Bale and a group of other people, live in a funny looking castle thing, up in the North of England and are quite happy to sit around, being miserable and generally minding their own business when a group of American Marines show up and start doing typically American things; Jumping out of helicopters, blowing things up, screeching around on motorbikes and firing massive harpoons at things. Matthew McConaughey, plays a bald and rather aggressive marine colonel, who decides that the best course of action is not to sit around being miserable but to kick some serpentine butt.As you can imagine, this annoys Christian, who was enjoying the dull misery of his life and is not about to let some slap-headed American tell him what to do. So they have a fight and as an indirect result things get blown up and there's lot's of shouting.If you like big, mean dragons that breath napalm and don't befriend little boys then Reign of Fire should be at the top of your list.In the new marking system that I've just invented, I give it 17 stars, which is quite a good score.

There is no kissing or love scene, no part where two characters sit down and talk for a long time, and quite frankly no part that isn't without action and tension in it. This doesn't sound like a good movie, but I'd like to say that there are two kinds of movies the kind that aims to win an oscar and place its mark in history while wowing the audience, and the kind that just wants to entertain the audience without trying to bore them. Reign of Fire is the latter; there is some drama in it but its mainly an action movie get that in your head before you diss it. There is are a lot of pyrotechnics involved, obviously, and I think this film uses them to the greatest potential. The pyrotechnics and special effects are fantastic and very realistic, with direction that captures its destruction perfectly. There is no gore in the movie either; while characters do get eaten by the dragon, the director made the smart move to just show them getting swiped away by the dragon and thats it. Like I said, this movie is meant to entertain the audience, not gross them out(though some individuals like myself don't mind a bit of gore here and there). I would have liked the movie to have the apache choppers in the posters featured, but not in the manner Godzilla did but sadly they aren't there. The movie, as I figured, isn't about characters loading up on weapons to blow the dragons away. Its about how they used their courage, their strategic options and sacrifice to defeat their enemies. It is an action movie, yes, but not the kind where the characters are like Rambo. The acting is good too Bale plays Quinn terrifically as the hot headed leader of the castle who's temper is the result of his desperation to protect his people. The guy who plays Van Zann is cool, too. He is a character who has continuously changing moods who really loses it once he gets excited. The female character was also good, for a change, and thank goodness she and Quinn don't kiss or anything like that. The world in Reign of Fire is terrific there isn't a single tree, nor a single blade of grass. Its just one gigantic field of ash and rubble.

What did annoy me about the film were the accents. We're in Northumbria, but the castle is populated by (Dick van Dyke style) cockneys. Why? Why weren't there any North-Eastern accents? Does Hollywood only understand two British accents cockney and posh? And we seemed to hop over to London like it was next door, when London is around 400 miles away. Other plot improbabilities include the weakness of the dragons that leads to their downfall, the fact the dragons thrive on ash yet seem to want to eat people, the fact that the castle population were starving yet they could have easily grown mushrooms/fungi and other produce underground, the fact that the castle occupants had an arsenal of weaponry yet civilians don't have access to guns in the UK (OK maybe they took them from military installations but the weapons weren't British standard issue).

This movie stars Christian Bale (American Psycho) and Matthew McConaughey (The Wedding Planner). Izabella Scorupco(Vertical Limit) stars as a dragon-slaying helicopter pilot. We know so much more about Bale's character, Quinn, than we do about McConaughey's character, Van Zan. We know enough about Quinn to sympathize with him. Van Zan is another story. Christian Bale's performance was good, including getting his butt kicked in the fight scene. Matthew McConaughey did not deliver his best performance when his lines come out so breathy that you crack up right there in the theater. I give this movie's special effects an A. I personally like this movie because I like action movies. Go see this movie for the action scenes but don't expect much else.

Due to time and production limits the full potential of the story couldn't be reached.  That doesn't mean that REIGN OF FIRE looks crappy.  Not at all! The special effects are very nice and not overdone, but I've got the feeling this could have become a great epic adventure with a profound list of characters and storylines if they had 2 hours more.  But time is money and director/producer Bowman did a fine job all in all.I like the way REIGN OF FIRE has a certain realism and there are moments when the setting (moisty and foggy UK) gives the film an independent look. Everything isn't as shiny and polished as most Hollywood special FX apocalyptic crap.  This film is serious and doesn't overdo the use of dragons and special effects to raise the action.  Not every dragon attack is as impressive as the other, but the psychology between the main characters can save some moments.  REIGN OF FIRE deserves a 6/10.On a personal note, I think it's a pitty that Christian Bale plays the main role, because I have troubles watching that man play after I've seen the terrible movie that is American Psycho.

So the plot goes in all directions.  Are we afraid of the dragon?  There is one great scene the one with the helicopter and the flying angels trying to put a net and Quinn (Christian Bale) on his horse attracting the dragon. I wonder why this movie is in an old castle in Northumberland (in reality in Ireland) with saints on the walls to give a more apocalyptic impression?  When Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) says to Quinn I am from Coffeyville, the town from which the habitants killed the Dalton-brothers this is very funny.  It is unimaginable that they come from there to England to fight the dragon.  Oh, yes, the dragon is in the shield of England.  Why does the big dragon not kill Quinn?  Has it something to do with the beginning when he receives some spittle in his face?  This movie lacks terror to be frightening.  It is a mixture of England and US, science-fiction and horror and Mad Max but it is not strong enough to have its own personality.  You even ask yourself if this is a movie for children or for adults.  The introduction is childish like in a comic of superman and does not convince of the great danger for the planet.

I was impressed, dragons burning down London. I can think of few, better things to see in a movie.  But there is one small problem and that seems to be that they forgot to add that bit to the film.  We see London before it gets torched and then nothing until the end of the movie.  Where we see the remains of London somewhere in between the film has lost something, which is a shame because it could have turned, what is a better than average film in a big blockbuster.  The film seems to have been set up for the burning city scenes but then sadly for the audience news paper and news footage seems to have been used instead.  I can only assume that it must come down to budgetary problems and stupid exec's but I do not know.As for the rest of the film.  Well the film starts off very stupidly. with a kid being able to go down a into some underground construction works which is a very bad sign but after that it does get a lot better.  The story is basic but that is what a person who is going to see the film is going to expect.  The acting for the most part is ok with the Christian Bale is about the only person giving much of a character.  Given some good dialogue Matthew McConaughey would have made a good Quint character obsessed with catching the evil beasts and whilst his actions do go some way to promoting this image but his character just comes over as a grumpy American with a gun most of the time.  Izabella Scorupco is ok but again is left to be the love interest.  The directing is good ok though a bit lazy at times.  What stand in the movie though is the mise-en-scene which fits the film and sets the mood perfectly.  The CGI at times is great but at other times seems to have been rushed which is a real pity.  The score for the film is ok and never becomes over powering.  Most of the sound effects are good but at one point I am sure that one of the dragons is making the same noise as a helecopter as it flies.Overall, its a good fun film in the same way that the Scorpion King is a good fun film.

I have been reading articles, interviews etc since the primary shooting wrapped some four or five months ago. This seemed to be everything I have been waiting for in film. Which is usually a bad omen!Construction workers in the heart of London unearth a Dragon and bang goes the neighbourhood. Before you know it there's thousands of the buggers, who live on ASH?, so you can imagine what the little tinkers get up to. To make matters worse, us humans in an effort to deal with the problem only cause more destruction. Fast forward twelve years and the few humans that are left gather together in encampments to try and stay alive. Quinn (Christian Bale), is our hero. He leads his group who see the protection of the children as the only way to keep the human race going. Then along come the guys that are going to sort the problem, i.e. the Americans. It then becomes a question of whether the Dragons will kill the two communities&#133;before they kill each other.Like I said, I've read an awful lot about this film before I saw it. The interviews with the Director Rob Bowman (The X-Files Fight the Future) really painted a picture of three-dimensional characters in a rich, weighty and action packed story. I am sorry to say that that might have been in the script and may if fact lie on the editing room floor, but it certainly is not in evidence on the screen. The story and characters all seem very thin and clichéd. The destruction of the world is glossed over, we spend precious little time with the communities to see how bad their lives are, and the Yanks are the weapon packing, strong, silent, great fighters, who know no fear types. Oh dear!!! To compound the problem the film is short, around 1 hr 40 mins, so there is no chance to ever gain an affinity with the characters.The actors themselves do their best. Christian Bale (Empire of the Sun) does quite well with the script he is given. Matthew McConaughey (Contact, Amistad), looking beefed up, really does very well not to laugh on camera what some of the American patriotic bullshit that he is asked to spout. Izabella Scorupco (Vertical Limit) looks too damn lovely to be one of the &#145;survivors'. Harsh criticism I know, the woman can't help being beautiful, she plays the final few scenes well but still just looks out of place amongst the ugliness and destruction.I didn't like The X-Files Fight the Future because, guess what, it felt thin and lacking substance. So I am going to have this down to Rob Bowman. There are some fantastic visuals in this film but a good film requires more than fancy graphics, so maybe it is time for Rob to go back to Television direction until he works out how to tell a story in the movies.I cannot express how disappointed I am in this film. Don't get me wrong; it is not a terrible film. What disappoints me is that in the hands of a good director this could have been a great film and it certainly is a far cry from being that.

They are unstoppable, extremely intelligent and very powerful. They can destroy cities in seconds. More intelligent than velociraptors, speed about at 1000 mph, and weight at least 50,000 pounds!!! They can see 100 times better than humans in daylight and 10x better in night. They live on ashes and the dead. The most scary creatures since Jurassic Park. Dragons used to be funny and stupid in fairytales. But in this movie, they are hardcore fire-breathing hellraisers. The special and visual effects were just off-the-charts. The story of the survival of mankind is quite amazing and how they gave a realistic view of all the countries in the world destroyed. If you love scary monsters then this is a must-see.

I'm a huge fan of Christian Bale's &#150; I thought his work in AMERICAN PSYCHO was one of the greatest and most faithful performances of any book-to-film character translation ever witnessed. He WAS Patrick Bateman. Is. Whatever. While the film might not have been totally flawless &#150; let's face it, most of the book was unfilmable, and I think they did a great job overall &#150; Bale was untouchable as Bateman. Especially with the voice.Ironic, then, that it's that very thing &#150; his voice, or rather his accent &#150; that really lets REIGN OF FIRE down. It's certainly not the only thing, but it goes a long way to making this film come across as totally ludicrous.OK &#150; I know what you're thinking. `This is a film about dragons, mate! Of course it's ludicrous&#133;' and yeah, I concur. But the problem is that any time a film that is pure fantasy has an element within that is unintentional comedy you tend to find that the entire piece is left somewhat farcical. I do tend to natter a bit during movies anyway (not loud enough to a problem to anyone apart from whomsoever is sitting next to me) but I found myself cracking joke after joke every time there was a pause after Bale's character spoke `Cor blimey Mary Poppins!', `Love a duck, apples and pairs, three for a pound!' etc etc. I couldn't help myself. The accent was that bad; straight out of Dick van Dyke school of British stereotypes.The movie begins in present-day London. Twelve-year old Quinn (Ben Thornton) pays a visit to his mother, a construction engineer, as her team work on improvements to the London Underground. Quinn watches on in horror as the team accidentally wake a huge, dormant dragon from an endless sleep. The dragon goes on a terrible rampage and the young Quinn is the only survivor. Over the next two decades, the world has been ravaged by thousands of dragons that have virtually wiped out humanity. We learn through the safe but somewhat tiresome format of press clippings (from TIME, and other publications) how the dragons have destroyed all of the world's major landmarks and that mankind is virtually on the brink of extinction.Fast forward to 2020, and the older Quinn is now the leader of a small group of survivors, who eke out a humble existence in Northumberland. Quinn, still haunted by the death of his mother, does his best to maintain a community of adults and children within the ruins of a castle. Their only source of food is a once-a-year apple harvest, and the crop is thinning. Folks are getting hungry, and some of the camp want to take what they can from the harvest now, ahead of time, but Quinn is adamant that they should wait until the crop is fully ripened, and can be re-harvested. When a team of dissidents decide to take matters into their own hands and grab some apples early, half of the crop, and one of the party, is destroyed by one of the dragons. We learn that the dragons basically live on death &#150; their food source is the ash from burnt human and animal remains. Due to the wipeout of mankind, the dragons are also on the verge of starvation, and their numbers have thinned. However, because of their eternal hunger, they have become more dangerous than ever. Quinn has become stuck somewhere between a castle and a hard place &#150; what to do, stay and starve, or move on and risk everyone being killed?Matters are made somewhat more complex by the arrival of Van Zan (a very buffed Matthew McConaughey, who clearly spent many hours down the gym for this role.), an emotionless, tough, focused military type who brands himself as a `dragonslayer'. Quinn dislikes Van Zan on site, but when Van Zan and his team of assorted militia take out a large female dragon (using all kinds of fancy equipment, plus a helicopter) he grudgingly gives his respect.Quinn meets Alex Jansen (played by Polish actress Izabella Scorupco, whose best known previous appearance was in VERTICAL LIMIT), Van Zan's helicopter pilot, and receives two key pieces of information firstly, that the dragons' eyesight, while superior to mans, is questionable during times of low light (i.e., dusk). And secondly, and most importantly, we learn that all of the dragons, bar one, are female. The male, who has never been seen by Van Zan or his team, fertilises all the thousands of females while remaining in an area of relative safety &#150; Van Zan believes that the male is still in London, the location of the first attack. Quinn realises that the male is the first dragon he ever saw &#150; the one who killed his mother.Van Zan then tips his hand &#150; he wants to use some of Quinn's men to lead a team into London to kill the male, thus effectively securing the termination of the species. Quinn goes ballastic, and the two engage in a spot of violent slap &#145;n tickle. Quinn is no match for Van Zan's physical toughness, however, and soon it becomes apparent that his battle with Van Zan is a lost cause &#150; half a dozen of Quinn's people volunteer on their own free will. Believing the attack to be a suicide mission, Quinn refuses to go, and Van Zan and his team set off alone.It transpires that Quinn's fear was well-grounded when all of Van Zan's team, bar Alex, are wiped out by a single attack from the male, who then traces their tracks back to the castle, effectively destroying it and dozens of Quinn's people. Quinn realises that if any of them are going to survive, they are going to have to take on the male and kill it. Together, Quinn, Van Zan and Alex head back to London in a desperate bid to save humanity.Gasp. Okay &#150; that's pretty much the movie in a nutshell, sans the final battle, and I'm not going to spoil that for you. I've already ratted heavily on Bale's accent in this film &#150; it truly is one of the worst you will have ever heard &#150; and Van Zan's Southern American hick-speak didn't exactly add much to the film either. Now, when you throw in Izabella Scorupco's Polish flavourings in there as well, you have a bizarre, and somewhat comical, little mixture. The acting, too, is surprisingly weak considering the strength of the male leads &#150; Bale appears to be very much going through the motions, and while McConaughey's character is physically impressive, he plays the role way too much over the top for my tastes, and is a bit too one-dimensional. Scorupco is basically there to offer a hint of potential romance for Quinn, and didn't really add anything to the movie or the plot.The movie did have some good stuff, though; throughout, the SFX are superb, and this is arguably the greatest visualisation of dragons that Hollywood has yet produced. The beasts, particularly the impressive male, are an example of CGI at its best, and it's only on occasion that you find yourself questioning them, but for a movie that is specifically about dragons they are criminally underused. For a world that has been ravaged by thousands of dragons, we only really get to see them in action on three occasions &#150; once, when the crop is destroyed, a second time when Van Zan and his team kill one, and finally in the battle with the male at the end. There is a major cop out when Quinn and Van Zan arrive in London to see the male's fortress protected by hundreds of females, only for all of the beasts to fly off when the male decides to eat one of them for lunch. Not only does this make Quinn's dragonslaying mission a hell of a lot easier, it denies us what the movie's poster promised but the film failed to deliver &#150; a massive battle between humans and dragons, as opposed to a smaller melee between three humans and one (albeit very large) male. I saw this movie with several friends and we all agreed that on this count it fell short &#150; you felt completely cheated and it was very much a case of a story that had great potential but didn't really know how to give the audience what they wanted.It probably would have been a better film if instead of skipping twenty years of dragons we'd have joined the movie a couple of years in; that is, right in the prime of the dragons' attack on mankind and the planet.Oh yeah &#150; look out for a very amusing STAR WARS parody in the first half of the movie. That was probably the highlight for me (well, aside from the trailer for RED DRAGON that preceded the film &#150; now that's a film I'm really looking forward to!)Overall, certainly not a bad film, but very much a wasted opportunity. Box office so far has been reasonable but I don't think a sequel is likely, which is probably a good and a bad thing. With a bigger budget, and a better understanding of what the public expects, a sequel could have maybe delivered something that Hollywood, nor REIGN OF FIRE, despite amazing CGI, cannot seem able to do &#150; produce the definitive dragon flick.Overall 6/10 "},{"Title":"Give it a chance","Date":"23 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Critics just seem to keep piling on...

And if you've seen Amelie, then you know how important acting with the eyes is (Within the same week I saw him Frailty at the Fantasy Film Festival here). Christian Bale was also good (last saw him in American Psycho--ugh) and this model, turned actress Izabella something-or-other proved she could hold her own. I wished the film were a bit longer so as to accommodate more action sequences, but all in all I enjoyed this movie. It was definitely popcorn entertainment at its finest.

I had a tough week, was tired, and basically just wanted to be entertained for 2 hours without having to do too much thinking. Because I went into this movie with the right expectations, I enjoyed what I saw and didn't bother myself with trying to analyze or figure out the plot.After reading a handful of reviews of this movie, I pretty much knew what to expect and what not to expect Some cool dragon scenes, some laughable dragon scenes, some people getting toasted, a crazed, post-apocalypse Matthew McConaughey, and some major plot gaps and inconsistencies.  All things considered though, it was fun.As long as you don't expect a plot that makes a lot of sense (i.e. accepting that McConaughey's army never has to worry about fuel problems for its tanks and helicopter), the only real knock on the movie is that there just isn't enough dragon action.  The few dragon scenes were definitely entertaining (save one, where the dragon looks like a water-colored cartoon), but on a planet overrun by the creatures we should have been treated to more people/buildings/anything getting roasted and eaten.  Thus, the only let down for me was that I wanted the dragons to be my favorite part of the movie, and unfortunately they weren't.That being said, for me anyway, McConaughey's character did a lot to make up for lost expectations.  While the role won't win Matt any awards, he really did a great job with it.  The new tatted-up, bald-headed look works well, and he brings the Van Zan character to life with equal zeal and psychotic-ness.  Not to mention that McConaughey's packing of hundreds of hours into the gym surely paid off when he drops his sleeve-less flight jacket and proceeds, via head-butts and all, to thrash Christian Bale's character.  I was most impressed, especially with his performance towards the end of the movie, with how well McConaughey played such a bad-a** character.All in all, I was not disappointed.  The caveat, however, was that I didn't go to this movie with high expectations.Finally, I'll say this Don't take your girlfriend to go see this movie, but if you have just finished one heck of a draining week, physically or mentally, its definitely worth an afternoon showing.  Entertainment value-wise, I'd compare it to Renny Harlin's Deep Blue Sea, but with cooler characters.Just don't waste too much energy trying to figure anything out, and just have fun with what you get.

Admittedly, this is largely the fault of marketing and advertising, and not the film-makers.  After all, it was the posters and the trailers that gave us images of mankind's greatest cities being decimated by vast herds of dragons.  Still, a bit more ambition on the part of the film-makers would have been appreciated.After a nice opening sequence, we're given the fall of human civilization in a five-minute narrated montage of newspaper headlines and magazine covers.  This has got to be the most underwhelming end-of-the-world sequence ever filmed.  If the film settled into a good story after this major mis-step, it would be forgivable, but sadly, this does not happen.Watch for minor spoilers aheadThe writers should have been made to understand that they could not have it both ways.  They make it a point to tell us repeatedly that dragons are not magical creatures, that they are flesh and blood, that they follow biological rules like any other species.  They then present us with the fact that dragons live on ash (why are they starving, by the way?  There seems to be plenty of ash), and that the entire planet's population of millions is propigated by a single male.The story flaws are legion, the most grevious of which is the ease with which the final solution comes together.  The plot falls prey to the lynchpin phenomenon, meaning that a rather simple act will bring the entire threat to its knees.  In other words, the writers painted themselves into a corner by making the problem insurmountable, and had to bull their way out of it.  This is not helped by the fact that the hero does not have to earn the information; it is simply dropped into his lap by another character who has already studied the problem.  The solution itself is idiotically simple.  We are told that the dragons stood up to every weapon conceived by man, including nuclear missiles.  Given the finale, this seems doubtful.The actors do their level best to elevate their material, but they're pushing water uphill.  Matthew McConaughey in particular is saddled with the very definition of a one-dimensional character, a caricature of American machismo who has nary a single line that is not a cliche.Add to this the fact that the only action sequence that creates any kind of tension makes no sense whatsoever (sky-diving to lure the dragons to the ground?  They don't seem to have any trouble approaching the ground at any other time), and you have a film whose potential goes completely unrealized.

I was more than a little disappointed to find that the biggest conflict in the film was between Quinn and himself.  Quinn (Christian Bale) turned out to be a very weak character he wanted the dragons dead but was unwilling to do anything about it himself.  Matthew McConaughey (Van Zan) is the flip side of the card, a tough anti-hero who has a singular purpose of destroying the dragons.  Izabella Scorupco (as helicopter pilot Alex Jensen) is the glue that binds the two together, and she gives an emotional and convincing performance as Van Zan's sidekick.  Alexander Siddig and Alice Krige put in appearances in bit parts.  As for the rest of the cast, never have so many done so little for so long.  Alex, Quinn, and Van Zan might as well have been the last three people on earth, and that might have been an interesting twist.There are only two real dragon-fighting scenes.  Mostly, it is just dragons torching unarmed civilians.  It makes Jurassic Park (1993) look like a fair fight.  It would have been nice to see someone else putting up a fight before the arrival of Van Zan.Much of the setting was advanced by a Time magazine article and flashing headlines that showed 20 years of destruction in text and still photographs.  They might as well have had someone walk across the screen with a sign that said And Time Passes.  The future was too bleak and desolate to dismiss the fall of mankind with a few flashed headlines.  The reign of fire happened too easily, and it seems the entire human race caved in to the dragons just as Quinn did.Other points (like Where's the oxygen coming from? and How do the dragons metabolize ash?) go unanswered and would have been less nagging if the plot didn't drag quite so badly between the action scenes.

The story was OK, but certain elements were missing. (SPOILERS) They should have shown how the dragons destroyed all the cities. And how could they have known there was only 1 male dragon. Rather silly. And at the end, all the female dragons just drop dead because they killed the male dragon?  I mean, the reign of dragons should have lasted many more decades because the millions of dragons left would have still have had to die out.ROF could have used a little more humor. The only funny lines were during the Star Wars skit.  None of the characters were great.  Matthew McConaughey's Van Zan was OK, but I was expecting more crazy stunts from him.  I didn't care for how he died either. Sure he was doing something crazy by jumping like that, but I would rather had seen him skydiving going right after one of the dragons.   And why didn't the male dragon roast Christian Bale when it had the chance. I thought all the dragons were starving, so why didn't it just eat him when he stood right in front of it.(END OF SPOILERS)Since this is a summer action movie, I was not expecting a great plot or acting. So, I think it was OK for what it was set up to be.FINAL VERDICT  Cool dragons, a lot of plot holes.  And don't be misled by the poster.

The whole plot is about fire breathing dragons that take over the world and the populus of the world is forced to live in warfare.  The people only live on one objective and that is to run and hide.

There's also an interesting way of hunting dragons that they use in which skydiving daredevils, called ArchAngels, jumps from a chopper and chases the dragons leading the dragons into a position where the troops can hunt them down.  The only way they can stop the dragons from spreading is to kill the only male dragon in the dragon's populus and they didn't have to worry about anything else about the dragons.

I like the acting in the movie. Mcconaghey was just right for a desperate, partially insane survivor. You live for 12 years in that hell and lets see how well adjusted you would be. Bale was believable as the leader of what he felt might be the only people left on Earth, and he wanted to lay low and live. Now about the nit-picking mentioned so far...1. Fuel was probably carried on board the C-5 Van Zan used to come to England. Thats a big plane folks. (Big!!!) Probably salvaged some in England too.2. They salvaged a lot of equipment in England when they arrived. How do I know. Most of the vehicles and weapons were British. (Yeah, I know the film was made in England, thats what was available. Exactly, that would be what was available if you did the same thing as Van Zan did.3. Why didnt they use anti-tank missiles and anti-air missiles on the dragons? Good idea. They probably killed millions of dragons. After 12 years of apocalyptic-level war, how many of those weapons would be left. Not to mention fighters, tank, soldiers to use them. Remember, the factories are above ground, the work force is above ground. You try to produce weapons when the factory is being destroyed around you.4. Radiation. There have been hundreds of nuclear tests in Nevada since the first atom bomb in 1945. Doesnt look nuked to me.5. The one male Dragon idea. Lots of animals in nature drive away/kill competing males so that they can have all the females look how competitive many human males are at a bar on ladies night)(. He probably killed any at birth he found. Maybe his aerosol-like sperm is all X (as in XX vs. XY chromosome).6. How did they know how to find him. One comment mentioned satellite imagery. okay. Since he is about ten times as big as the females that would tend to show up I think.

The dragons then proceed to unleash a reign of terror and fire upon the land.The living creatures on planet Earth are decimated almost to extinction in a matter of years not only by the dragons, but also through the stupidity of the various governments of the world, who in the end try to nuke the reptiles to death but only succeed in creating a virtual all-you-can-eat buffet of the very ash that the dragons apparently need to eat in order to survive.  Oh, and please don't ask how the planet escaped any kind of nuclear winter or radiation poisoning.Cut to 18 years later and we find our little Quinn has survived into adulthood, a man who speaks worse English as a man than he did as a boy. Played by the talented Christian Bale, Quinn is now just a pale, hollow-faced husk of a man in charge of a quasi-fortress in a Northern England castle filled with survivors intent on outliving the damnable beasts.  There's a wonderful moment of levity early on where Quinn and his friend Creedy act out the infamous lightsaber fight between Luke and Darth Vader at the end of Empire Strikes Back for a gasping and transfixed audience of children.Enter the ugly American, played by an over-the-top Matthew McConaughey, who literally grunts through most of the movie as Denton, a pumped-up, tattooed George C.

The only thing that got me through the theater door for Reign of Fire was the fact that it was about dragons, not insects, Rob Bowman (X-Files Fight the Future) was directing, and that Matthew McConaughey seemed to spend a great deal of time displaying his muscles. I thought I would be OK. After all, dragons aren't flapping about anywhere right now, so I thought the dismay factor would be slim to none. Little did I realize that Anthony Hopkins was lurking in the trailers waiting to scare me to death.  The idea of watching dragons demonstrate their new landscaping plans for earth (basic ash black) may not frighten you, but the trailer for Red Dragon that comes before the movie is enough to petrify even the most stoic of slasher film veterans.

How that man ever chances to leave his house without having droves of people passing out in terror upon spotting him I really don't know.Reign of Fire, completely defying my less than stellar expectations, is one of the most fun movies I've seen so far this summer. Set in 2020, the earth has become a ruin, having been ravaged by dragons. Human survivors are few and far between, and those who have managed to elude the winged creatures are in hiding. It is in one of the last remaining outposts that we find the two unlikely heroes of the story; Quinn, the group's fire chief, and Van Zan, the dragon slayer to lead them into battle. Christian Bale (American Psycho, Swing Kids) stars as the aloof leader, Quinn. Bale spends his on screen time (quite unlike his fluffy summer movie counterparts) taking his role seriously, which definitely helps the audience to do the same. Though at times his role does take a leap into the realm of silliness, the good far outweighs the bad. Bale's eyes are absolutely haunted in spots, and his incarnation of the tortured young boy who first saw the beasts that would bring about the end of the world who grows into the peaceful leader is affable, intelligent and strong. I am quite impressed by his ability to a) sit on a horse, and b) pour half a bottle of iodine into an open wound without his head exploding. Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, Dazed and Confused) stars as dragon slayer Van Zan (aka Commander Fruit Loop) and has totally sunk his teeth into this larger than life role. McConaughey plays Van Zan as a slightly more psychotic version of R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) His mood swings make for a slightly cartoonish character, but he's so much fun to watch that you never really mind. If Bale's Quinn could be imagined running through Dragonheart, McConaughey's Van Zan is the Mad Max element to the story. His grittiness, and energies are perfect summer movie fare.Though Reign of Fire does offer its share of incredibly predictable moments (i.e. the cannon-fodder scene where a group of men decide to go spelunking down a tunnel that a little boy has just come careening out of, bleeding out his eyes, screaming that `there's something down there!!') it does show a remarkable amount of stylish smarts. Everything from the dragon ravaged London, to my amusement at realizing that once again, though the rest of the world may be destroyed by fanciful creatures Canada has been left alone (like in ID4) adds to the bite of this film. It's usually the case that I am the absolute worst person to have with you when watching a creature movie of any kind. Outside the theatre, I am completely hip, inside a shrieking ninny, watching from behind my hands. I find most of these movies to be frightening beyond belief. Reign of Fire doesn't fall into that type of movie though, being all about the people, the survivor's spirits, rather than displaying how many humans a dragon can consume in 90 minutes. Rob Bowman has done a great job here, refusing to let this fantastic tale be overwhelmed by the heat of the beasts contained within it's borders. A must see.

At no point did I ever believe that dragons could be responsible for the destrution of so much of the earth. I couldn't buy the premise (and believe me I wanted to)  If one actor had made a comment about how ridiculous the idea of skydiving past a dragon to draw it's fire was - I would've enjoyed much more of this film.  Instead everyone recites their lines is the same tough as nails style - which got old fast.It's not the performer's fault - McConaughey fares well as an ex-soldier turned dragon slayer.  However, there are very few character qualities for the audience to hold on to.A great deal of work ha been put into the dragons - and they are frightening beasts - but they are also one note creatures.  Their only purpose is to pop-up every so often in the film and barbeque another actor.I give it a final rating of Five.  The actors try and the effects are good. The film is well shot and and edited effectively- but in the end I didn't have much fun with this film - and it really should have been.

I guess it depends on your taste, of course, but I love good action movies and I really love character studies and this is what Reign Of Fire is really all about. The dragons are, obviously, the catalyst for what's going on, but the real meat of the picture is Christian Bale's performance as the passive armageddon survivor intent on keeping his community safe at all costs. He's challenged on all sides; members of his own family question the wisdom of his decision to lay low and avoid confrontations with the fire-breathers, and the newcomers led by McConaughey try to rally Bale's followers to his own cause - to take on the dragons. This conflict, and seeing how it plays out, was what captured my imagination about this film. The fact that the special effects were incredible and that the action scenes rocked were just icing on the cake! AWESOME movie!

What an anti-climax! At the end of the movie we're left with so many unanswered questions. We barely even find out that the dragons eat ash - it's only hinted at and not even said outright.I would recommend seeing the movie for what it offers, but plan on seeing another movie that day or you will not have a good theatre experience. "}{"Title":"Where are all the dragons?","Date":"22 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Okay, with a movie like Reign of Fire, you can't possibly expect an oscar caliber movie, especially one that has such a B-Movie look to it.  But, I still paid to see it, since it looked like it had promise, and a good Mad Max ripoff.  I wish, like so many other reviewers on this site, that I had waited until this had come out on video.First, I will list the good qualities.  The setting, though bleak, is really interesting.  The survivors are holding out in a modified castle, and are rebuilding their lives away from the dragons that live in the remnants of the World's big cities (Paris, London, etc...).  This concept in itself is just cool, and in a way, very believable (Two of the leaders even act out a scene from The Empire Strikes Back to the children, since there is no TV or radio anymore...What a cool idea!) but that's where the believability stops. Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey were excellent in this film, giving very believable performances.  The believability with the movie itself however, (besides the acceptance of dragons taking over the world, and our great militaries having been defeated) drops when Van Zan and his troops come in the picture.  This is where the movie begins to fall flat.  I will say the paratrooper scene was exciting and very original, though, it amazes me how they said they killed so many dragons with this technique when the survival rate is 17 seconds?!?  Where did they get the endless supply of soldiers?  Oh wait, this goes into the negative part of the review.The negatives, unfortunately, far outweight the positives.  Though most people on this site have mentioned this, I will mention it b\c it frustrated the hell out of me during the whole movie.  Where did they get the gasoline to fuel all of their tanks and the helicopter?  How did all of the soldiers survive for so long, with what looked like maybe two truckloads of supplies? How do the two main leads look so ripped and physically in great shape when their food supply is next to nothing?  Oh, these and many more quesitons arise when watching this movie...oh, and they are so frustrating too...it is usually easy to overlook certain inaccuracies in a movie, but a movie about survival that has huge inaccuracies about survival?  That's a big problem, indeed.Another problem I had is the action, or lack there of.  Another reviewer hit the nail on the head, where were all the dragons?  I was really mad to see that one dragon was capable of destroying entire populations of people, and that the people's weapons had no impact on them whatsoever.  I wanted to see humans fighting off hordes of dragons in huge melees, tearing them to pieces with automatic weapons and whatnot.  Of the few dragons they actually do come in contact with (you can count them with less than the fingers on one of your hands) they sure get their butts kicked, even with great weaponry. And even so, I don't want to see a picture where we, as humans fighting for survival, get toasted continuously, I want to see some a$$ kicking, you know like soldiers going nuts and tearing the dragons (whom, after all the destruction, one grows to dispise very quickly) to pieces.  I mean, if for anything, how about for pleasing the crowd?  I went into this film thinking that dragons as the villains was not the best idea, and this was constantly confirmed as the film dragged on.  There are a few good scenes, but from an action standpoint, it reminded me a lot of the flop, Godzilla, where hundreds of bullets are flying and not harming the average looking CGI at all...it's like, what's the point in having guns at all if they are not going to at least make a dent in the dragons?  We as the audience thrive for those thrills, especially when man overcomes huge obstacles and comes out on top.  There really aren't any crowd pleasing scenes from a summer action flick...that is disappointing.Overall, this was an okay movie, it actually defines mediocre.  I believe this movie could have been ten times better with, and I hate to say this, less about the people and more with the dragons (I hate to sacrifice plot development, but hey, this is a summer action flick afterall).  I'll give this one a 5 out of 10 for an interesting plot, good acting and a great and appropriate, dreary setting.  The other five stars would have been alotted for thrills, suspense and fun...however, Reign of Fire has very few of any of those qualities.  Wait until it comes out on video and you've seen everything else. 5/10.

It is a pity that the plot elements are not up to par with both the acting and the scale of production.The greatest difficulty I had was that I could not become completely absorbed in the experience of the movie.

The rest is shots of gray landscapes and shirtless men arguing.  The shirtless men must be a nice sight for the ladies but, alas, they did nothing for me.I always think that post-apocalyptic movies are going to be great, but rarely do they ever create a compelling universe for their characters to live in.  Life in this movie consists of running, hiding, digging, and arguing about when the best time is to harvest the tomatoes.  I was not deeply involved.  Director Rob Bowman seems to be in love with vehicles; this film worships tanks, trucks, helicopters, etc.  It's a shame that more time couldn't be spent on people instead of hunks of metal.  And the vehicles don't even do anything cool.  I kept waiting, and waiting, for the big tank to fight a dragon.  Didn't happen.  The whole film is gray and dull, just like Bowman's previous work on The X-Files.  And while I don't expect logic from a sci-fi movie, this plot is so hole-ridden it defies description.  Suffice to say that the origin of the dragons is silly and contrived, and so is their final defeat.The most important question to ask about a film like this is was it more fun than the alternative, sitting at home?  Nope.  To quote an oft-used criticism of this film - too much draggin' and not enough dragons.

Sometimes you walk out wishing you could have your three hours back. Othertimes, you walk out thinking the experience was *much* better than you'd hoped.That's how I felt after seeing Reign of Fire. It's a rare occurance; Matrix and the original Die Hard were two movies I walked into thinking they would be so-so and they turned out to greatly surprise me. That's a wonderful experience, if you ask me. A tremendous feeling of satisfaction, like you earned the money you spent. You probably know by now the plot of this movie. It's a visualization of numerous science-fiction novels from past decades, where the modern world is thrown kicking and screaming back into the Dark Ages. In this instance, it's a large male dragon unleashed by unsuspecting British construction workers. The dragons breed like locusts, so fast that most of us can't comprehend the extent of the numbers until it's too late.The movie is set in England, another plus. Too many times these movies are spent in America and I think it's nice to transport the movies to other world locales. Britain is the perfect setting because humans, once again, find themselves holed up in castle fortresses, about the only thing that are keeping the dragon hordes at bay. Inside the castle is a refreshing mix of modern technology and 16th Century living, where modern-day gadgets rub shoulders with tales of fantasy, fairy-tale and the supernatural. This is one of the few movies that captures what is can normally be told in the pages of a books, and it's this blending of ages - and an almost intoxicating gritty, dirty atmosphere that blankets this movie from start to end - that makes Reign of Fire work so well.The British are a tough people. They always have been. Probably always will be. And inside their castles that dot the Isle, the scattered remains of the once great British Empire are found struggling and making ends meet even as dragons buzz bomb them from the skies, much like the Nazis did to London and surrounding countryside during the early days of World War II.Down the road in a cloud of dust comes the Americans, making one Britian quip, The one thing worst than a dragon are Americans. Well, as an American, I didn't mind seeing the Americans in this movie portrayed as warriors pure and pure. After all, it seems to be America's legacy to bail Europe and its people time and time again out of trouble, and we don't fail this legacy in this movie. What should keep the Europeans from screaming Americanism at the top of their lungs, however, is that this movie is essentially about Europeans - Britians in general - and how a Britain (SPOILER ALERT) eventually is the one that brings down the baddie. But like in World War 1, World War II, etc, etc, etc, the British people would not have been able to survive without the aid of their longtime upstart colonists, the good 'ol U.S of A.There are some good action sequences throughout the movie, as well as some good shocking moments with the dragons, particularly in the tomato field and when the male dragon was prepping for his attack on the American armored column. Great stuff. The sky-driving dragon bait part, however unrealistic, was at the very least entertaining. Although I think we could have come up with a better way to lure the dragons to the guns... (shrug)In a movie of this type, I kept expecting your typical 'Hollywood' cliches to pop up throughout the movie - but they never occurred. There were no cheesy one-liners or no smiles and puns spoken during the heat of battle. The music, directing, and screenplay were all top-notch. And again, I loved it seeing a man in an American M-1 battle tank with a crossbow in his hands and battle axe slung over his shoulder. Those shots alone would make a great movie poster for the wall.And who can fault dragons? Not since the days of Dragonslayer have seen dragons take to the sky and spit forth fire down on the heads of humans hunting them. This is no CGI Godzilla or mind-controlled dragons from the dredge that was Dungeons and Dragons. These dragons are smart, stalk their play and, like cats with mice, even stalk and play with their human prey. Rejoice!Although the subject matter was fantastical, the movie never did step into that area. For that - and for the great, midievil atmosphere and to see a helicopter taking on a flying dragon, I give this movie 8.2 of 10.Go see it. It's better than a rental from Blockbuster.

Scorupco didn't have much depth, but aside from her the cast did well (WITH WHAT THEY WERE GIVEN).Now as to what they were given, there was not a whole lot.  In my opinion, anything conatined in the script for this movie was garbage.  The dialogue was absurd at many times, with lines like, We can do this two ways the easy way, or the very easy way, which make you want to stand up and say, What the hell was that supposed to mean?  Aside from the dialogue, the plot has more holes than the clothing in this film.  Soooooooo many things happen where you wonder where the hell things came from, just like Waterworld.  Apparently when 3 million dragons take over the entire planet and burn everything in existence to a crisp, people still have computers, electricity, fuel, fire extinguishers, and satellites.I thought visually this movie was a real treat to watch, but there is one flaw, the script.

Almost all shots of the dragons last a couple seconds,  too short to get scared or excited.  Frankly most of the effects looked cheap.  Near the end of the movie the story loses all sense of coherence,  and I just didn't care what happened.   For the fun of it, I'll list a few more lame story highlights (Spoilers)- The leader and strategist for the remaining humans is the boy who survived the initial Dragon attack.  Even though he has no background for such a thing and survived by sheer luck. - The Earth is destroyed but electricity, fuel, and water are plentiful.  - An outdoor garden grows unscathed by the Dragons. - Only one male dragon exists,  despite many years and thousands of dragons being spawned.- This one male dragon stays put in London,  even though he's supposed to be zinging around the planet making more dragons.- Men are drafted to be Ark Angels,  despite the fact that there are plenty of soldiers left that arrived from America. - Dragons own the sky, but the lady in the helicopter flies anywhere she wants.- The lady helicopter pilot changes accents with every scene.- Thrill as an entire warning system is thwarted when a 5 story dragon sneaks up on the castle!  Yes, really, he creeps up on his tippy toes!- You can only kill a dragon during sunset,  but they launch an attack during the day.  - Dragons need to eat humans to survive,  they in fact are so starved that they are eating each other.

Instead, a narrative exposition sets the stage, without the visuals. All this would be acceptable, without major plot-holes. First of all, the dragon's motivation in killing people, is strictly to feed. Most of the humans killed are incinerated, not eaten. Where is the fuel supply for the military vehicles ? Dragons survived underground for 65 million years. Last but worst, thousands of dragons, only one male.

I have fallen for hype of up and coming movies more times than I would like to admit.  Reign of Fire was a movie that seemed to be coming in under the radar and that had me wondering why.First let me say that I am a sci-fi fan to the extreme.  Dragons being re-awakened and destroying the earth, pushing man kind the very brink of extinction!?  This, to me, was mouth watering to say the least!First let me say that the special effects in Reign were top notch.  The dragons were terrifying and believable and as the title suggests, there was fire-o-plenty.  I was really impressed with the attention to detail that was given to the special effects.The characters were potentially interesting, but beyond Matthew McConaughey's Dragon Slayer, Denton Van Zan and the dragons, there was little to hold my interest.  Christian Bale did a good job at portraying his love for the people that had come to depend on him, but in no time at all was wearing his heart on his sleeve.  I was more taken by his likeness to a young James Brolin than I was by his character.  The rest of the characters in the story were throwaways.  Izabella Scorupco was beautiful but flat. I kept thinking how clean and lovely her lips were, no matter how dirty her face got.The movie's plot is laid out in the beginning, after the initial introduction to the dragon and the rest is a downhill ride to the ending. No surprises, just a lot of fire power and testosterone.Overall I was entertained and I really did enjoy the experience.  I just left the movie feeling that Rob Bowman could have done a better job on the flow and storyline.  "},{"Title":"Too many plot holes, poor characters, and not enough substance.","Date":"17 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  `Reign of Fire' has a good concept.  It's a post-modern dragon-slaying story once reserved for knights of King Arthur's court. However, this one is set in the year 2020, 18 years from present and the knights have been moved aside and replaced by a 21st century American vigilante, and his team of worn soldiers.The story opens in modern day, at a London underground (subway) construction site.  A school-boy, Quinn, is visiting his mother, the fore-woman of the site. While visiting, Quinn goes down into the tunnel that is being dug and uncovers something fierce and ancient.  That something is a dragon, that's been underground for centuries, lying dormant, and is now awakened.  The dragon surfaces&#133; and the movie begins  We are then narrated (as opening credits role) the next 18 years&#133; as we learn that the dragons (there are more than one?) have populated to an alarming rate causing mass destruction on a global-apocalyptic scale.  Why we were only narrated this, and now shown it, is a mystery to me.  What's left come 2020 is a small community, that has been able to thrive in a castle on their own. Quinn (played by Christian Bale) has grown into a commanding father-figure of this community, and shortly, they receive guests&#133; the US army led by vigilante, Matthew McConaughey, who claims he and his team are skilled and know how to slay dragons.What bugs me about this whole movie is that the best parts, the dragons spree in devastating Earth, is the story they should have been showing us.  Instead, they narrated that portion to us in only a few minutes, and instead tried to show us a couple of would-be heroes trying to slay dragons with very little resources.The characters don't even seem real.  They seem to be here only because the movie requires them to be, but not because they are interesting or might be able to contribute to the story.  As such, I have no feeling for these characters, and no feeling for what happens to them&#133; live or die.  In fact, I really didn't care if they succeeded in killing the dragons or not&#133; I would have been as interested to see the dragons win, to be quite honest.As for the dragons&#133; they're apparently a threat.  But the majority of the ones we encounter wind up dead.  If they're this easy to kill off&#133; how come they weren't wiped out when there was only a handful&#133; or one, for that matter?  **Spoiler alert** Speaking of &#145;one' &#150; there apparently is only ONE male of the thousands upon thousands of dragons that have populated the past 18 years&#133; Yup, believe it, ONE male spawned thousands of offspring.  This, we are told, is the same dragon Quinn found as a boy.  Somehow that one male, was able to populate, and spawn thousands of only-females. (?!) That in itself is a tad hard to grasp, but we are also led to believe that the characters have figured this out on their own&#133; that there is only ONE male on the planet&#133; AND they figure out where he is, and how to kill him. ***********The visual effects of the dragons and their interacting with the scenery and the actors are equally impressive.  However, 10 minutes of special effects doesn't quite carry the movie, I'm afraid.The final 2 minutes of the final battle scene is quite well done, but again, it doesn't carry the movie and isn't worth the price of admission.I went into this movie with zero expectations, and got exactly what I expected&#133; nothing.

Very spooky and works but thats about the only good part of his movie. Now we skip to the future around 10 or 15 yrs.The world has been overrun and destroyed pretty much by the dragons and the young boy from the beginning is now 20 something and the leader of a ragtag band of survivors in an old castle in england somewhere.This is where the movie totally goes unbelievable ,we are led to believe that with all our resources the dragons have defeated our armies and taken over.There arent any scenes of this just flashes of old magazines that show destruction and news articles.Problems with plot holes, mad max lookalike feel. where does matthew mcconahey come from, they roll in on tanks and a helicopter ,surely there are other troops that survived if they did.and what do they use for fuel?. the dragons look good but are hardly seen but for a few glimpses and when its closeup look fake. and christian bale looks like a model more than a soldier and why does he insist that they stay holed up in a place that could obviously be burned up anyways.And the far fetched ending , figuring if they kill off the male that will stop the procreation of dragons . well what about the thousands that are already out there. and what about it being the only male , thats ridiculous. why in the past hadnt they just gone into london and bombed the nest.So at the end what we have are three people armed with just crossbows and a machine gun to do the job millions couldnt do before. come on get real. some of the special effects are good but overall the movie drags in between action scenes and i found myself fighting to keep awake. this movie could have been so much better , why didnt they show how the world was taken over instead of just skipping 15 yrs into the future. at least they could have made it feasible to show why the dragons were able to overcome us. in reality i think we would have wiped them out ,i mean in the movie matthew mcconahey kills a dragon with a harpoon cannon which isnt that big a weapon. we have stuff that could knock down the eiffel tower ,,im sure we could have blown away these dragons ,,we have jet planes that can fly a hell of a lot faster than the dragons could and with heat seeking missiles wipe them out..  there are too many unbelievable plot holes and the ending to me is unresolved , like what does quinn do with the dragon egg he gets from the dead female dragon and what about the gillions of other dragons still alive. this has sequel written on it ,i hope its not true..  i dont recommend this movie , if you must see it ,,go when its been out awhile and playing at the 2 dollar movie theater.    see you at the movies "}{"Title":"Great film, but...(semi-spoiler)","Date":"17 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  When I first saw the preview for 'Reign of Fire', my first thought was, I must see this!

It's better than Dragonheart, which never really took itself seriously enough to be fascinating (and which I own on DVD because it came free with my player).  It's better than Dragonslayer, which was (and still is) impressive in it's own right, but again included too much humor for it's own good, as if it didn't trust itself to be a good adventure.  That's not to say that Reign of Fire didn't have humor, but it wasn't included in order to lighten the mood.  It allowed itself to be serious, to really explore the social ramifications of the existence of these creatures, these forces of nature.  The performances are solid, and the effects are incredible.  It also, amazingly, managed to avoid all the action/monster movie cliches that we've actually come to expect from a summer blockbuster.

The concept is good- how would humans fight back against this awesome threat- but the movie is put together very sloppy. It's almost as if the writers decided to take turns seeing who could come up with the best action while forgetting to check with each other for continuity. What we get is 90 minutes of choppy action sequences mixed in with a little exposition and little explanation of the basics. For instance, the Brits fight to keep their garden growing and in one attack by the dragons, it's gone. How could they keep it going so long out in the open like that with the dragons all around? Then the Americans show up, beat up Quinn, conscript soldiers, go to what's left of London, and get turned into toast with only Van San surviving. And to top it all off, when the trio of 'heroes' get to London again, how does a Kentucky Redneck grunt know so much about a town square he's never been to; and wouldn't a bull dragon have something better to do than fly a predictable pattern over this square? Hardly... I guess my main point is the story is good, however it looks as though novices were given their first chance to write action and their enthusiasm went unchecked. Hollywood has done better.

THIS is the movie that should've been made (for a taste of what might have been, check out the short story, The Day of the Dragon, by Guy Endore).  Instead, we cut to about 20 years later, when Quinn (Bale) is now head of a band of survivors, hidden in a hilltop castle!

This movie kicked ass.  I've heard reviewers take it down, and friends say it'll just be a knockoff of other sci-fi movies playing up FX over story.  They're right, but it's still a damn good time. Audiences cheered at the end.I for one could not BELIEVE the helicopter sequence.  There was something so surreal and otherworldly about the whole process (with something out of Mad Max in the tanks and motorcycles heading to battle), with maybe the most entertaining sci-fi wizardry I've seen since the Jurassic Park creatures. Of course, there were other great sequences, (SPOILERS) the attack of the dragon on the convoy or the castle, the escape from the harvest fields, or the final sequence.  All of them were put together with a fine pace and a fine cast.The script isn't weak and thin, just QUICK.  The story gets across the basic primal elements it desired too, how a group goes from hiding from the beast to taking them out.  Bale, McConaughey, Scorpuco, and DR. BASHIR FROM DS9(!) all do a fine job at balancing a bit of comedy with some good drama and thirst for action.Actually, this script was FAR smarter and less cliched than that for Spider Man or Star Wars Episode 2 in its dialogue.  Three essential questions What do we do when we sleep?  What do we do when we wake? What do we do when we see him?  It had probably more enticing and SURPRISING effects to boot and great cinematography.

The eggs hatch, dragons breed out of control, and the world is engulfed in flame.  Governments collapse, leaving only a handful of rag-tag Englishmen and some American military types to uncover the reptiles' secret breeding spot and destroy them in the nick of time before the world goes to hell in a handbasket.It's too bad that the film is so poorly written.  From the very beginning, the film staggers into unbelievability, with numerous plot holes, errors, goofs and stumbles.  Story exposition, which is essential in a fantasy film that takes some time in the future, is almost completely lacking.  The characters' motivations are poorly limned, and star McConaughey delivers a lackluster performance. Christian Bale tries very hard to give depth and emotional weight to a role that is a not well-written, and only partly succeeds in making it work. Watch for an animated, energetic performance by Izabella Scorupco (who should have been listed more prominently in the title credits as one of the film's stars) and young Scott Moutter (whose role as Bale's protege and surrogate son is strong, well-acted and emotional).  And the special effects are really good, especially the two final scenes with the bull dragon (attacking the castle and in the final battle in London).The basic plot -- McConaughey has discovered the dragons' two weaknesses, which he is going to exploit to destroy the bull dragon that is making all the baby dragons while Bale, who is too emotionally disturbed by all he's been through to help him -- is inventive.  But the film's glaring plot problems make you groan in pain.  Any good fantasy film has one foot firmly in reality and the other in fantasy.  Unfortunately, Reign of Fire is so mis-handled by its first-time screenwriters (two out of the three writers are novices) that these problems fill your mind as you watch.  You forget to get involved in the movie.  And that's perhaps the most damning thing that can be said about a fantasy film.If you want a great dragon film, ignore Reign of Fire and go watch Dragonslayer again.

A dragon appears right at the start which had me saying, More, more!  It was a magnificent, yet appalling and evil-looking creature, melded by an unsurpassed form of CGI.  Although Dragonheart's Draco is much more believable, these things do tend to come alive on the screen.However, I was saying More, more! and it seemed the film's creators were saying, Less, less!  The movie centers mostly around the group of English men, women, and children struggling for survival from starvation and boredom in a castle rather than the dragons themselves.  We see little of the dragons, which proves to be a major disappointment.  Especially for me, since I went into the theater today wanting nothing but the dragons.  I didn't care if there was a plot or a good story to back it up, I just wanted to see the dragons.  But the dragons are satisfying and have their great moments that simply enthralled me.It's a straight-forward, man against beast, survival film.  Not even the post-apocalyptic atmosphere gets in the way.  I first expected to see a movie like Waterworld, where people are going crazy constantly and everyone's wearing ragged clothes and humans have simply reverted to caveman-like appearances and actions.  But Reign of Fire is nothing like Waterworld or Mad Max.  The characters wear normal clothes and none are crazy (with the exception of maybe the dragonslayer, but he does have his reasons).  They are civilized and I was not at all diverted from the film's plot.And indeed, it does have a plot and story.  Some people argue that, in the end, there are still hundreds of dragons which is kind of an anti-climax.  But I say it could be a great introduction to a series of movies, leaving plenty of room for a sequel.As for action and intense scenes, I was greatly disappointed.  The few scenes in the movie involving dragons and their prey were hardly enough to satisfy my taste, most being too short to really get a chance to see the dragons in their full monstrosity.  The movie has a great climax, though, with an excellent central antagonist that is absolutely terrorizing and intense.The music, composed by Edward Shearmur, is not unlike Danny Elfman's militaristic approach to Planet of the Apes.  It also has a great percussion composition throughout the whole movie, and I was very surprised.  I had never heard of Shearmur and instantly thought the music would turn out to be a crummy spawn of James Newton Howard's Waterworld.The movie is above average, having some great scenes and excellent CGI.  It delves in deeply rather quickly, so one will need to pay close attention.  Some scenes are funny, too.  I won't go into detail, but let's just say one involves Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.All in all, a great movie for dragon-lovers.

I, for one, had a blast with this one.  Seeing a buffed up Matthew McConnaughey get a chance to play the badass was well worth the price of admission and his lines make the movie worth seeing twice. You can tell he had a great time playing Van Zan.  I really got into his character and it's easy to see why he took the role. He's a hard guy to figure out.  Van Zan comes across as a total psychopath, but you can tell that there is a heart in there. I'm really not much on movies with a post-apocolyptic setting, but this one went down really well with me.  The concept, I thought, was really refreshing, and with a lesser director, this could have been another Battlefield Earth.  I'm happy to say that Rob Bowman pulled it off like an old pro and the Dragons are some of the most convincing CGI creations I've ever seen.  McConnaughey owns the movie, but Christian Bale did a fine job with his character and so does the rest of the cast.  My only real complaint was the ending.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but it all wrapped up just a little too quickly for me and I've got a feeling that there's going to be a sequel.  To me, the 101 minute running time just wasn't long enough.  I could have sat there for ten hours and not uttered one complaint.  I was really into it.  For a Summer action flick, this one really covered a lot of ground.  For the most part, it hit all the right buttons when it came to the drama, humor, action, and suspense.  There was a little bit of humor that I thought was misplaced (I'm referring to the opening scene), but that's forgiveable.   All in all my $7 was well spent and I WILL most definitely be catching it again before it leaves the theater.  If this one looks appealing to you, it's safe to say that you're going to love it.

Humanity is scattered to small communities.It gets more crazy. Two hundred soldiers can be quickly reduced to nothing but ashes, totally cremated, by the fire breathing dragon, but their leader is unharmed hiding under a tank - he should have been dry roasted by the heat.It gets crazier. To fight the dragon scourge humanity decides that if they kill the one male who is fertilizing that host of female egg-laying dragons no more baby dragons will appear and they will die out. One problem with that just because only one male animal fertilizes many females does NOT mean there are no other males! How many male trout, or other animals, die or are fought off by the dominant male, when trying to fertilize or mate with the female? A great many. So the method of defeating the dragons is ridiculous. It would never work.Even more ridiculous is Matthew McConaughey, leading the soon-to-be-cremated American army unit. He overacts so much he is almost laughable, while at the same time looking like he is undergoing Steroid Rage; he is so pumped up since the last time we saw him he must have been hitting the juice. Perhaps he thought Reign of Fire was a satire.Now for the good parts. The dragon FX are great. The dragons are fun. Burned out London reminds me of Stalingrad in World War Two from Enemy at the Gates.

Leaving the theater disappointed didn't end my night well, but such is life.Quick plot outline Near future, London. A small boy enters a construction site (never being given a hard hat) to visit his mother who is a worker there. While at the site, he is sent to check out a cavern that's been found while excavating. (did the notion of child welfare even exist then?). Not surprisingly, he finds something in there a (hostile) dragon. While trying to escape together in an elevator, his mother dies but he survives. Fast forward a few years, after the dragons have scorched the world. That same boy, Quinn (Christian Bale), is now a man, heading a commune of survivors. There are some nice touches here, such as Quinn acting in a small play (recreating a famous Star Wars moment) for the children of the commune.One day, Quinn's group spots tanks moving on their compound. The visitors turn out to be headed by Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), a stereotypical American right down to the half-chewed cigar and ballsy attitude. Also stereotypical is a quip by Quinn's friend Creedy (Gerard Butler), saying that Americans are the only things worse than dragons.Van Zan came to the British Isles to try to exterminate the dragons after examining their epidemiology, but lost a lot of men on the way and needed a place to rest and re-supply. It turns out Van Zan knows how to kill dragons and is the head of a high-tech military force that does the same task. Of course, the squad's helicopter pilot, Alex, is a drop-dead gorgeous chick (Izabella Scorupco). Why is it, as in Independence Day, that the Americans are always the ones who are ahead of everyone else in trying to stop a global threat?Van Zan tells Quinn of his mission to eradicate the dragons and wants to draft soldiers from Quinn's group. Quinn refuses saying it is suicide, arguing that they have a better chance of living in hiding. Van Zan argues that Quinn is just letting them die slower. This is one of the few neat points in the movie both end up gravitating toward one another after they both lose a lot of men (Van Zan through his arrogance, Quinn through his fear). I would have felt more sympathy for them had the movie focused more on this aspect but it felt rushed.Anyway, Quinn, Van Zan and the hottie pilot go to London in a mission to kill the only male dragon. Needless to say, they succeed with only Quinn and the hottie pilot surviving, and Quinn fires the fatal shot at the dragon (presumably the same one who killed his mum), getting some payback.The story couldn't be more cliche but, as I said, there are some nice touches, albeit a very few. The movie spends some time developing the espirit de corps of Quinn's group, and the dragons look pretty sweet. Also, Van Zan has this nostalgic looking dragon-slayer axe that he uses to deliver the death blow to a downed dragon. And Christian Bale is great you can see a lot of emotions underneath Quinn's exterior, like a volcano about to erupt. He is tough but you can tell it is difficult for him to keep his emotions in check.Aside from some neat touches, there's not much much else that differentiates this flick from many of the big budget blockbusters I've seen that bore the hell out of me. Without these good points I probably would've enjoyed the movie more because it would have felt that the movie was succeeding in being mostly a special-effects and explosion extravaganza.In retrospect, I don't think I would've even paid the matinee price for a ticket. All in all, it is a letdown.

Where does the army get their electricity for their little computers and such, and where do they get gas for all the cars/tanks/helicopter?  I mean, they use their vehicles A LOT and if they can't find food where is the gas coming from?  When the first dragons came onto the scene, why couldn't the world deal with them then?

Secondly, we never found out how one male dragon was able to multiply into millions.  It was presumed that there may have been eggs also in hibernation, but this was never stated.  It also seemed strange that Van Zan would say that the male could fertilize 100 000 eggs, and yet not one of these 100 000 eggs would hatch another male.

Preserved, just like he was, since the middle-ages.Who then is to say that there aren't going to be hidden clutches of eggs left after the remaining females are dead at the end of this movie's predictable timeline? That could be fun. But wait, no males mean the eggs are not fertilized, which means in turn that the eggs won't come alive. We're safe!Or are we?`Jurassic Park' taught us one thing there is at least one species of animal that can switch gender when there are no choices for successful mating. Who is to say that dragons can't do the same thing?That's why I said that evil word sequel earlier.Check this out At the end of the predictable timeline of this movie, after the successful elimination of the only male, there are only females. This means that they will eat each other (only females) until there is only one left. At that point, this female if it isn't killed outright by humans, will force a stasis on itself just to survive (of course this might all be done anyway once the food is gone); and this means that it will *know* that it is the only dragon left (or at least it will have a darn good idea.) During its stasis, it will morph/gender change, so that when it awakens it won't be female anymore, and thereby can fertilize the millions of eggs left by itself and its sisters.But that whole theory is beaten by the sheer fact that no known species on Earth does that. It would be odd, to say the least, at least as odd as the sheer idea of dragons in the first place, for nature/evolution to allow such a messed up system to come into being.Which leads me to the idea that there *are* other males out there, still sleeping. And those unfortunate Britons just happened to awaken one.That means more males to be found, that means more babies once awakened, that means&#133;.yup, there's that `sequel' word again.The idea can self-replicate. And if `Reign of Fire' does well enough at the box-office, and you know how Hollywood loves that cash-register sound, there will be plans for more (minus Matthew McConaughey of course.)This all leads me to my actual review (the above was just stuff I wanted to get off my chest.)    Matthew McConaughey reminded me of a `G.I.-Joe' character brought to life, he seemed to be acting too tough for his own good. Almost, but not quite, laughable.Other than that, it was an average film. Out of `10,' I give it a `5.' Solid average. If you like dragons, if you like Matthew McConaughey, if you like post-apocalyptic stories, then go see. But I do expect a sequel if the $$$ is high enough. We'll see if I'm close at that time.

It is an apocalyptic action/adventure film about the human struggle for survival. The story centers around Quinn(Christian Bale) who lives in a castle in the year 2020.  Several years before, he and his mother(Alice Krige), an engineer building an underground rail tunnel, happen onto a  cavern where a large dragon was in hybernation.  Quinn barely escapes with his life, but all others in the tunnel are killed including his mother.  Later Quinn becomes the leader of a group of survivors including stray adults who have no where to go and a large group of orphaned children.  With his best friend Creedy(Gerard Butler), he tries to teach them how to grow their own food and protect themselves from the dragons that have taken over Earth and decimated the population. The quiet world of the castle occupants is invaded by the arrival of Denton Van Zan(Matthew McConaughey) the leader of an assorted group of National Guard soldiers who he has enlisted to fight the dragons.  Van Zan shows his abilities when the castle is attacked by a dragon. He and Quinn work together to kill it.  Van Zan then decides the only way to kill the dragons is to go to London where the lead male dragon is located and kill him.  He tries to enlist several of the castle inhabitants, but when they don't volunteer, he drafts them.  On the way to London, the entire group is wiped out by the male except for Van Zan, his helicopter pilot Alex(Izabella Scorupco), and a wounded soldier. Meanwhile, back at the castle, the male has followed the scent of the soldiers back to the castle and is attacking it.  Quinn and Creedy are able to save most of the children and some of the adults, but in the process Creedy is killed.  Quinn locks himself and the survivors in a room deep in the castle to wait out the attack.  When it is finished, they are rescued by Van Zan and his party.  After this Quinn realizes that they have to go to London and kill the male dragon.  He leads Van Zan and Alex to the lair that he had discovered 18 years ago.  During the fight Van Zan is killed.  Quinn and Alex fight the dragon and in the final battle, Quinn shoots an explosive arrow down it's throat.  In the end, Quinn and Alex return to the castle where they find the young man, Jared(Scott Moutter) Quinn had raised from childhood caring for and protecting the survivors of the castle fire.  The community begins to enjoy peace again and Quinn realizes that Van Zan was right, that killing the male dragon would kill the species because they hadn't seen another dragon in over three months.This movie was formula.  I've seen the same story in other features such as Mad Max.  But this doesn't make this a bad movie.  In fact, the chemistry between McConaughey and Bale is a hi-lite to the movie as both actors play characters with diametrically opposed personalities.  Bale was excellent as Quinn, an intelligent, gentle man trying to rebuild a life for himself and the people under his charge.  McConaughey was good as the obnoxious and passionate Van Zan who allowed his desire to kill dragons take over and eventually kill his company. I was surprised and pleased by Izabella Scorupco's performance as Alex.  She portrayed Alex with strength and dignity as a helicopter pilot who was trust into a life she would not have chosen.  This is not often seen in Hollywood movies.  Butler gave good support as Quinns best friend, Creedy All the other actors in the film gave equal support, making this movie an ansemble film. Rob Bowman as the director was excellant as usual, but as a fan of the X-Files, I'm a bit partial.  He assisted the actors and the story's flow, bringing it together as a complete story.  The visuals were great, especially the aerial scenes. Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who wants two hours of escapism.  Although, I would recommend that parents with children under 13 not take them to this film.  Several children in the audience I was in were disturbed by the graphic violence and loud sounds.

After years of reigning over the earth, and torching everything site, people have begun to lose hope. However, Den Van Zan (McConaughey) offers hope to the nerve-racked english survivors, hiding in a castle.This movie is not big on story, or any particular theme. It's about one thing. Dragons. Dragons killing people, and people getting pissed off and killing dragons. And for that, it is great. The graphicas are very good, for most of the picture. At times (Especially at far-away or large encompassing shots of the male dragon) it becomes almost painfully apparent how fake it is, but those occasions are fairly well. The dialouge, though not all that important and hard to understand (Due to dialect) at times, is well written.A good geek film overall.

I knew that, even if the rest of the movie was terrible, Christian would make it great.  And luckily, the rest of the movie WASN'T terrible.  In fact, it was very good!  Most monster movies focus too much on the monster, and not enough on the people who surround it.  This film doesn't make that mistake.  Rather than being a film about evil dragons who kill people and burn things, it's a movie about a man (Quinn, played by Christian Bale), and the life that man has known.  We see him go from a young boy who's been doing badly in school, and grow into a strong man and leader, who is willing to die to keep his enclave of survivors alive and safe from the dragons.  When Van Zan (McConaughey) arrives, Quinn sees the fragile grip he's had on these people's lives slipping away.  For a while, it drives him a little mad.  Then, it gives him new purpose.  Christian Bale is an amazing actor, and he gives the character depth that ISN'T just written into the script - it's the kind of thing that a lesser actor would have failed with, but which Christian Bale does marvelously.Lest you think Christian is the only fine actor of the bunch, let me assure you, he's not!  Matthew McConaughey also does a fantastic job as Van Zan, the rough American dragonslayer who shakes up Quinn's tremulous existence in Northumberland.  The character could have been a violent warmongerer, but McConaughey gives him enough emotion that you can believe there's a man inside that hard-as-steel physique.   Izabella Scorupco (Alex) does a wonderful job - she's not the damsel in distress, but she's also not the hard as nails ice queen so many of these movies like to foist on the audience.Another added bonus there's no swearing, no sex, and, to be honest, very little bloodshed, at least for a movie of this type. You only see a few people get eaten.  The rest is all implied.  So while it's certainly not a kiddie film, you don't have to worry about the gore you might tend to associate with this type of movie.If you want a monster movie with heart, you could certainly do worse than Reign of Fire.

It's also hard to imagine that a dragon would be buried under a city for millions of years without ANYONE knowing.  How did it get there?  Was there a way for it to get out?  How did it eat or even breathe?On the other hand, the special effects were done very well.  I've always been a dragon fanatic and to watch them fly and wreak havoc was exhilarating.  I remember having a similar feeling the first time I watched Dragonheart.  I have a haunting suspicion there will be a part two since Quinn pulled a dragon egg from one of the slain dragons.Anyway, if you still feel compelled to watch this movie then go to the matinee and save yourself a few bucks.

I'm not one of those killjoys who tear apart every movie for its disloyalty to basic scientific principles. I'll willingly suspend my disbelief to permit giant flying fire-breathing dragons even though the aerodynamics would require them to having a wingspan about the size of Long Island.But what I cannot deal with are movies where the plotline is intensely stupid denying even the most basic reality. Let's see now. The dragons came up from the earth after hibernating for about 100 million years. I'll buy that. They commenced to burning up the entire planet in order to make it into ash so they could digest it. OKAY. The world's leaders decided that they didn't know how to get rid of the dragons, so they fired off nuclear weapons destroying civilization. No, I don't think so. Two decades later, a small band of survivors armed with crossbows and C4 explosives kill off the lead dragon. No way, Jose.The writers of this film have obviously never heard of either Afghanistan or Somalia. In both places, illiterate tribesmen essentially living in the Stone Age were able to bring down helicopter gunships belonging to the world's superpowers, the USSR and the US, using hand-held Stinger missiles about the size and weight of a bazooka. Thousands and thousands of Stingers were smuggled into Afghanistan during the Eighties. They are cheap to produce and easy to use. In other words, if the Earth were threatened by a bunch of dragons, the President could call up the Chairman of the NRA, ask him for his membership list and give each member free Stinger missiles and a bounty for dead dragons and end the problem without appreciably threatening the budget deficit let alone risking the destruction of the planet. The dragons might make for interesting entries in an upcoming World Barbecue Competition but that's about it.Let's go to the movie. Christian Bale really tried hard but as Casey Stengel said of the 1962 Mets, 'You can't make chicken salad out of chicken feathers.' MAtthew McConnaughey was awful, chewing up scenery like some roided-up refugee from Vince McMahon's WWE. Isabella Skorupca looked good. It was nice to see her buffer than in the Bond flick she appeared in but as an actress she has two emotions, standing up and sitting down.  The effects were good not great. The sound system was awful. The accents nearly unintelligible.Maybe, I just don't like 'post-apocalypse' flicks generally. It is really hard for me to believe that within a generation of the world-destroying disaster that the remnants of humanity lose all their ability to do anything. That didn't happen after the fall of the Roman Empire and literacy was not commonplace then. I found myself watching this film asking when the remnants of Britain were living in their castle/mine/cave whatever, 'Doesn't anybody have a g-damn cellphone in all of g-damn Britain?'Maybe, the dragons developed a true 'smart bomb' and killed everybody in the world with an at least room temperature IQ.The only thing that rang true in the movie was that the Americans tried to confront their vicious adversary, while the Brits just ran and hid and whined about the Americans in typical European fashion.

Dragon movies may well be the bane for the next two.  As happens with all well-made movies of any genre, once a standard is set, it can only go downhill. Granted, Reign of Fire has elements of both action and horror movies, but from the second the crisis is introduced until the last line, there is so much more to the story than just the outmost conflict of man versus beast. Such addition lifts the story line above the standard usually found in action movies, at least for now.(Spoilers ahead)Quinn Abercromby, the main character, is bogged down by guilt over events he couldn't control, and yet manages to govern a colony of survivors in the time of lawlessness.  From the pathetic scene of  `Star Wars' Quinn and his best friend reenacted for the  children to his choked recitation of the commandments he drafted and drilled into the survivors through rote, Christian Bale shows that there is more to his character than just finding and killing `the beast'.  From the beginning when we are introduced to the personal `issue' Quinn has with the bull dragon to the final scenes that involve his rapidly expounding faith in his ward, the audience sees that despite Quinn's tough, weathered face the word at the root of his heart is `family'.  The combination of vulnerability and impassiveness makes Quinn a true hero. Van Zan is not afforded that luxury.  From the second he breezes onto the screen to the instant he flies off it, Matthew McConaughay's character is nothing more than a cardboard catalyst.  Your typical American, Van Zan comes in, shakes things up and, despite an almost tender moment the night after the Americans arrive, is about as emotional as the dragons he hunts. Necessary to do the job?  Yes, but Van Zan is detached to the point of madness.  After a very short while, his character becomes boring, yet his adrenaline-packed action sequences are enough to draw in the teenage boys and keep them watching. Finally, the real stars of the movie  the dragons.  To put it simply, they were a perfect nightmare.  From the coloring- thankfully black, showing the production crew did SOME research into the myths- to the malevolent gleam in the bull's eyes as he stalked his final prey, almost everything was `on'. Sure, there was the occasional physical impossibility (how does a creature with huge wings but no arms make its way up an elevator shaft?) but overall, the general effect of the dragons is startling, especially with the real fire.In summary, the characters were unpredictable in their quality, the dragons were excellent most of the time, and the setting, not mentioned above, was perfect for the plot.  The dialogue was real, but could've packed more meaning without being bogged down, and the end was pure poetic justice. The rough, apocalyptic hero of the movie is an excellent departure for Mr. Bale and it was refreshing, if a bit annoying, to see Matthew McConaughay in a role that would have been better serviced by Vin Diesel.  My only complaint is the content  the writers could have done much more with the world they created, making the movie longer and showing specific events from Quinn's intermediate past to draw the viewer in.  Action movies are no longer exclusively for boys, and it would have been nice to see more of the hero's past, creating a stronger bond between Quinn and the audience.

Reign of Fire definitely was more serious in scope and mood, and although their dragons were even more natural and well animated, there were significant plot flaws that will disappoint many viewers.  For example, our lead character Quinn, leader of a failing survivalist colony, rides a horse in some of the more compelling action scenes.  It looks great, sure.  But if this colony was really struggling as much as they claimed, I'd wager that horse should have been converted into pony patties long ago.  The biology of the dragons is rather shaky as well, and the conclusion not as stirring or action-filled as I would have hoped. On the other hand, the dragons themselves look very cool...when they're on screen.  I'd compare this best to Jurassic Park II excellent CG creatures, passable acting, but patchy plot.

This sets off a cataclysmic event of hundreds of dragons destroying the earth and feeding on mankind. With humans on the brink of extinction in 2020 AD, a group of survivors, led by Quinn Abercromby (Bale), reside in a castle in England.  They are nearly out of hope when a supposed 'dragon slayer' named Denton Van Zan (McConaughey) and his company of Americans, including Alex (Scorupco) a helicopter pilot, show up with a plan to kill the dragons.This film did not disappoint special-effects wise, and the acting was well done.  However that didn't make up for the fact that there were gaps in the plot.  The movie ends leaving many questions unanswered.  It would have been better to see more of the destruction of earth's great cities.  All that we see is in a TIME magazine!  Watching the dragons destroy cities like New York and Paris would have given the setting a broader perspective instead of staying in England the whole time.  Another part I would have liked to see would have been Van Zan in America killing a dragon in Kansas, and their trip across the Atlantic Ocean to England.  This would have given the audience a better feel of the dragons impact on the world and Van Zan's desire to kill them.  One more thing I would have done would be to go into detail on Bale's hate for the creature responsible for his mother's death. This movie had the potential to be spectacular.  It is significantly better than other dragon movies such as Dungeons and Dragons, but is certainly not an action/adventure epic.

Two hundred soldiers can be quickly reduced to nothing but ashes, totally cremated, by the fire breathing dragon, but their leader is unharmed hiding under a tank - he should have been dry roasted by the heat.It gets crazier.

One problem with that just because only one male animal fertilizes many females does NOT mean there are no other males! How many male trout, or other animals, die or are fought off by the dominant male, when trying to fertilize or mate with the female? A great many. So the method of defeating the dragons is ridiculous. It would never work.Even more ridiculous is Matthew McConaughey, leading the soon-to-be-cremated American army unit.

The last one before it was the box office flop which goes by the promising name of Cutthroat Island. Before Pirates of the Caribbean, there was Reign of Fire. Dragon films are equally few and far between. Touchstone Pictures was probably thinking the same thing eight years ago, Hence they went ahead and distributed Reign of Fire, hoping people will see it as something new and worth paying for a ticket. The movie is silly and unbelievable as one might expect, but it is also low on clichés, fairly simple and strait forward, and entertaining enough that it works well as an action as well as a sci-fi and a creature feature.The year is 2020. Following a decade of dragons charring the planet, Earth is now a hellhole. People survive in scattered groups. The story zooms in on one of these groups. A young Scotsman by the 'very' Scottish name of Quinn has turned an old castle into a care centre for orphans. They are reasonably safe, but food is scarce and their weapons are not many. One day however, American colonel Van Zant rolls into town with a squad, asking for sanctuary. He knows how to kill dragons, but can be persuade Quinn and his friends to help him undertake a massive dragon hunt, which risks everything he has built.Reign of Fire takes the fight deep under ground, across the land, and also high up in the air. I think I can safely say Reign of Fire delivers what it promises, but with plenty of extra stupidity. Even if you end up loving it, it is a guarantee that you'll find at least one problem with the movie. What bothered me a little when I first saw it, was the image of the future. It doesn't feel like the future, more like the past. Despite all the destruction, people still have electricity, so who is running the electrical companies? if there are any left.Dragons can come in all shapes and sizes. They can be ugly and vile like the one in Dragonslayer which looks like the warty,scaly Jack Pallance of dragons. Or they can come as aerodynamic acrobats of the sky like Reign of Fire. The creatures here are the first dragons I've seen with no arms or legs. They look like Bats, and as dumb as the film is, I think a biologist would agree which me that these Dragons are the most scientifically accurate fliers. Their light weight bodies. allow them to move fast and agile enough that anyone free falling from a helicopter, will never know what hit him when they come swooping down out of the fog.Anyway I think I've made my point. Flawed as it is, Reign of Fire delivers. On account of its not very positive reception, the movie seems to be heading for oblivion, but it's worth a watch.

My first impression was that it was some medieval based dragon war thingy(I hadn't seen the copters by then or the machinery). But the other day , getting bored reading the newspaper,I switched on the TV and on came Reign of Fire. I said why not give it a shot - It's got Matthew Mcconaughey and Christian Bale - It can't be that bad...boy was it awesome!!From the word 'Go' ROF switches into the 5th gear, taking us straight to the story of how dragons returned from their hibernation. News flashes and newspaper clippings tell us that they were the real reason behind the extinction of dinosaurs(after extensive research of course). This is 2008. Shift to 2020 and we see a band of survivors in England(well not band..there are more than hundreds of them)living in fear from dragons. They are waiting for the dragons to die out slowly, taking no action other than hiding in doing so. This group of survivors is led by Quinn(Christian Bale). Soon we're joined by marines from US led by Van Zar(Matthew Mcconaughey). It is evident their is distrust between the 2 leaders, their styles of facing the dragons also different(Van Zar likes to hunt 'em down). These marines arrive at Quinn's place asking for shelter for a few days. Soon after dragons attack and we see how capable Van Zar and his troops are, particularly Alex(Izabella Scorupco). From here on the viewer is thrust into a world full of action, dragons, artillery and shouting albeit all with sense and right amount of witty dialogues.From the action point of view ROF has some amazing CGI to boast about for a 60million budget. The dragons look cool and believable, the action is well choreographed and it's not always about the action, which is the best part about this movie. Rob Bowman knows just when to mix the action with smart dialogues, intimacy and vigor.The acting is spectacular. Izabella Scorupco is spot on with Alex, a trained hard copter pilot who is not all emotion less. Scott Moutter, who plays Jared(like a son to Quinn), is given a bigger role than you'd think he'd be given and he plays it accurately. But the surprise comes from Matthew. Matthew tries something new this time, something I don't believe he's ever done before and he plays it so god darn well. The stone hearted person who cares for nothing but to kill the dragons yet knows he needs his men. Truly Matthew adds something special to this film. But the real package is Christian Bale. I've seen his batman series and I'm not much of a fan of his acting(though the series otherwise is quite outstanding)and I know that ROF came 3 years before Batman Begins did, but still I gotta say I was surprised when I saw Christian bale not talking in his rough undertoned voice. That's the first thing that got me glued to my TV screen! His acting is superb, his dialogue delivery is impeccable, the frequent changes in the frequency of his voice are so precise for the character. There's no one who could've played this role better.As I said the dialogues are witty, the plot is carefully thought out, the acting is superb(except for Gerard Butler who I found was overacting), the action is amazing, all this making the movie totally awesome!I'm gonna go with a 9 out of 10. The one point cut because I don't believe In perfect movies and I think the grand finale could've been more grand.P.S - The subtle intimacy scenes between Quinn and Alex are so delightful! You expect them to kiss or do something but that's what the filmmakers wanna show. A war is at hand and people who've just met can't be making out like that!Even till the end! Awesome Film!!!

When they come back to wipe out the over-populated humans, it's time for modern artillery meets dragon-slaying adventure as a few survivors meet up to try and find the Male Dragon (the only one, apparently, that helps the dragons reproduce--I smell a great potential for a sequel!) What I found interesting is that here was a post-apocalypse society where anarchy does not, in fact, flourish--because anyone dumb enough to revel in the lack of rules would quickly be eaten. Oppressed by their own mortality, for once, the characters are forced to literally fight down to the last fingernail. It's pretty sweet.It's certainly not perfect but it's a much better crafted action adventure film than most standard fare.

But I do enjoy films of that adventurous, post-apocalyptic, horror possibly blended in with science-fiction ilk such as 28 Days Later and Twelve Monkeys. Alas Reign of Fire cannot hold a torch much-less so a light of any sort to those two films but it may be possible to get a feint kick out of what the film has to offer during its point of attack and the concentration on Christian Bale's character as an orphaned; somewhat disturbed male living in a post-apocalyptic dystopia with the few human survivors that remain.But rather than go down a route of intellect or insight revolving around post-apocalyptic societies or perhaps even trying to make some sort of statement alá George Romero in his shopping mall based Dawn of the Dead, Reign of Fire prefers to entertain its audience with its CGI dragons; long shots of the world in urban ruin and 'best friend-worst enemy' banter between Bale's character named Quinn Abercromby and American Denton Van Zan (McConaughey). It always feels a little odd watching a film at a time during which the film's narrative apocalyptic catalyst occurs. In this case, it's London 'around 2008' and a dragon is randomly awoken by construction workers underground. This event causes the end of the world after the dragons attack the human species and it's left to our own nuclear weapons to try and stop them. I suppose it is here at which Reign of Fire's commentary begins and ends if the construction team had not been underground, the dragon would never had awoken which could be a statement on modernity let's stop building and expanding and we won't eventually bring an end to the world. The other commentary could be a statement on nuclear arms and how, in the end, it was our own weapons that eventually destroyed the cities even if they were initially on fire via the dragons.But any film which ventures off down the route of 'man vs. CGI dragon' for its final act isn't going to have too many things to say in the end. The first time we see Bale's Abercromby, he is topless and plugging away at a rock with a pickaxe no-doubt an opening shot for the teenage girls this film's aimed at to savour. From here, it appears the Brits have holed up in a castle of some description attempting to keep themselves sane with two year old alcoholic spirits and re-tellings of Star Wars films. The post-modern world as we know it has been destroyed through our own lust to ever-expand and now we are reduced to ancient, aural techniques of telling stories in centuries old castles in Northern England &#150; the world has very much been set back a few hundred years.But like I said, the point of attack is the most interesting part of this film and it's only when the American's arrive that it begins to feel as if it has that 'American' touch. As a force, the American characters drive around in tanks; chew on cigars; are built considerably large and harbour tattoos. The British counterparts are relatively thinner in size, do not seem as gung-ho and indeed do prefer their nightly entertainment to revolve around story telling as opposed to loud rock music and dancing. But I do not think the film touches on a metaphorical context enough; that context being the film revolving around Britain and America teaming up to fight an enemy that has re-surfaced after many, many years of hibernation. You could read into it that the 'enemy' aren't dragons but is, in fact, terrorism. But then the fact this was not written or indeed shot post 9/11 even though it was first released in July 2002 floats to the surface and you realise there's nothing there anyway.So if when the Americans arrive the film changes its ideas and tone somewhat, then it's eventually for the bad. We have to start suspending our belief half way through a film that did not, under any circumstances, demand us to up until this point. But when we have a helicopter flying a few dozen thousand feet above the ground during a sequence in which the Americans are trying to capture the dragon rather than kill it, it feels a little cheeky. Similarly, the plot point involving Van Zan and his theory on what spawns these dragons feels utterly out of the blue and acts as a mere reason to shove the film into the direction of the final third. Some other things I was confused on involved why the dragons bother to eat the humans when it is made apparent about half way through that they can survive off ash &#150; strange. Also, when Abercromby and a few other Brits go off to rescue one of their own who has run away, they do not bring guns but when the Yanks arrive in their tanks, they have practically every turret within the castle they inhabit covered with soldiers wielding guns &#150; even stranger.Reign of Fire does not suffice as an action film and fails as a social commentary of any kind, even though there's a bit to read into nearer the start. The last act is a bit of a shocker and I do not believe for a second that Bale's character could be sure of the underground London layout all those years later. What if some of it had caved in? What if the chimney that provides the heroes with the twist of fate had collapsed in the mean time? These questions need not be asked in a film of this genre and consequently, Reign of Fire need not be considered anything above slightly ordinary.

The dragon that is released terrorizes the world and spawns millions more that destroy civilization almost entirely. World militaries, in an attempt to eliminate the creatures, only aid in the annihilation.By the year 2020, Quinn has gathered a band of 60-100 who reside in an old castle in Northumberland, England. They are a holdout, isolated from others, living in fear of the dragons, keeping two eyes on the sky. Here enters Denton Van Zan, an American dragonslayer. He and his team have been successful in destroying the dragons in America and have crossed the ocean to continue their seek and destroy mission. It is frequently reiterated that the world will be dominated by one species or the other. The question is who will win? Will mankind unite to drive out and vanquish the dragons that have ruled the earth for millennia? The idea of a dragon movie has the potential to be very cheesy and... dumb. However, director Rob Bowman (director; director of The X-Files) succeeds in producing a master monster movie.The sets were very well-done and realistic. For the most part, Reign of Fire was filmed onset by an experienced camera crew. Because of the setting (misty England, ashy destruction, smoky air), the resulting fog and eery lighting creates more opportunities to have a tense atmosphere.Bowman uses fire extensively (as can be imagined) and the effect is fantastic. There is always something burning, reminding the viewer of the danger lurking just around the corner.Suspense could be built better, but the idea that the characters are being hunted is enough to give an edge.Bowman creates the dragons as more than just animals- they have their own personality. They are cunning and smart, a step ahead of the characters, and (of course) they have heightened senses fabulous vision... except at magic hour, the half-light time between dusk and night.The acting is phenomenal. Christian Bale (of The New World and Batman Begins) stars as Quinn Abercromby, with Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera) as Creedy, Matthew McConaughey (Failure to Launch) as Denton Van Zan, and Izabella Scorupco (Exorcist The Beginning) as Alex Jensen. There are several child actors, as Quinn's compound has become a community, who all perform wonderfully. Admittedly, it is not difficult to act panicked when there is real fire on the set, but they all do very well. My only complaint is that the American crew led by McConaughey is supposedly from the south and Scorupco's polish accent does not lend credibility to the plot there.Rob Bowman has created a futuristic/fantasy world by combining the timeless legends of the dragons, of course, the castle back-drop, and the self-sufficiency of the surviving people, but he sets it in the future (almost present day) and therefore takes advantage of modern-day weaponry and the this-could-happen-to-us element.The movie does get a bit predictable, with the antagonists' tragic flaw of raring up and exposing the chest before breathing fire, and the failing vision at twilight. Also, there is not a lot of character development, although viewers can see that Quinn feels guilty and takes the blame for unleashing the monsters... and causing his mother's death. Thematically, Bowman expresses the idea that it will be either the dragons or our own destructive powers and disinclination to unite that ends the dominance by the human race. The dragons supposedly killed all the dinosaurs, and we wonder if mankind has evolved enough to the intelligence level of taking on these creatures and conquering them.Rated PG13, it is not suitable for family viewing. It is violent, though not especially gory. There are few curse words and no sex or drug content.Overall fantastic movie.

But the honest truth is that it could have been so much better. Now I know that it isn't unusual for people to point out flaws here or there about a film like why didn't they do this instead of that nitpickey type stuff. But in this case I can't help but feel sorry for the sheer potential this movie was not given a chance to attain.Imagine Earth in a post-apocalyptic era, but instead of the ravages of a nuclear war we find the skies to be ruled by fearsome dragons who seek to hunt down and kill the few remaining humans. The beasts not only incinerate their targets with their fiery breath as the legends foretold, they feed upon the very ash which their destruction creates. The humans, battered and frightened by the dragons' sudden appearance and ruthless fury, struggle simply to survive as they are constantly under threat. This alone is an excellent premise that could have lead to an amazing film, but just as it seems to be gaining momentum it feels like it runs right into a wall. It's as if the director simply tried to tie up all the loose ends too quickly and in doing so stunted a story that might have been better left with a few mysteries unexplained, or battles yet fought. Again, the movie does deliver with great visuals, tense fiery battles and believable characters. See it if you haven't, hell maybe I'm expecting too much from this movie.

The dull dialogue offers nothing thought-provoking, and just keeps repeating what we already know.I'm one of those a-holes who wanted to see the dragons' destruction of most of mankind, which was totally skipped over in a quick montage/monologue, right after the first one escapes from the underground excavation site. Film also skips over its intriguing premise of the dragons' earlier reign of terror during prehistoric times, and how they were the 'real' cause of the dinosaurs' extinction. So, it wouldn't all be constant dragon attacks as some fear it could be.Otherwise, there are only a few quick unremarkable action scenes involving the dragons (well, one at least). And why are they partying with fire lights blazing and Hendrix blaring?! Isn't the world suppose to be under vigilant siege?! Or am I not getting it? I never felt any real sense of threat. There were millions that destroyed the world, weren't they? Well, where are they? And the militaries with all their advanced weapons can't stop them, but these jokers are able to save the day by simply shooting an arrow into its mouth? Hmmmmmm. I must be missing something. Oh! Right! It's only a dumb movie I can't even take seriously enough to suspend even the slimmest disbelief. And I was so bored, I just didn't care. Never an encouraging sign.Is it presumptuous of me to say that there are dumb popcorn flicks that at least entertain and deliver on their own fantastic terms - and boring ones that don't?

Obviously, this immense budget was directed towards the effects, because the acting lessons and screen play were terribly neglected.The premise has mankind involved an Independence Day type conflict. It's them or us. This time, They are the denizens of Dragon Kind. The dragons featured in this movie are fire-breathers who feed on humans for sport. They are also western dragons, for those of you who know the difference, and extremely well done. I was so impressed with the DRAGONS! Mankind vs Dragons in an all-out war for the world. The possibilities were endless and I was very excited about seeing this on the big screen.The dragons featured are Black Dragons. Fire-breathers, as I mentioned before; meat-eaters. Black Dragons were the perfect choice for this scenario, as this is how they are portrayed through legend to have behaved. Good thing for us there never were more than a few in existence at a time, or this could very well have been a history lesson.*sighs* So much for the studio hype.Unfortunately, the wonderful black dragons featured here are all there is to be impressed -with- in this attempt. The story is riddled with huge plot holes and the worst kind of contrivances. That, and the utterly infantile dialog were enough to send me home even though I had read the critic reviews concerning the serious lack of action. Because of those reviews, I was really looking forward to an &#150;intelligent&#150; thought-provoking film. I thought that finally there has been a great movie done with realistic Dragons and no comic book feeling to it (by that comment, I refer to Dungeons and Dragons), when in reality this was a total waste of $95 M and nearly 2 hours of my life.Another minor problem I had with this movie was in the musical score. It sounded to me like it was written for an original episode of Cannon or Barnaby Jones. Then there was the gratuitous socio-phallic American-bashing. I'm sick of hearing that crap. The contradictions and plot holes are blatantly obvious to anyone who's seen the movie, so I won't bore you with them. To say that the plot was weak would be a gross understatement. The direction was seemingly adequate, when they remembered there were supposed to be Dragons in this movie, that is. There were some almost-creative anachronisms and a few innovations, but nothing worth bothering to mention.If you're looking for a couple hours' mindless fun, this is it. But for goodness sake, don't go into it expecting anything more than good Black Dragons and just ignore the rest of the trash filling in the time around their scenes.The best story element; that of the Dragons coming into power, was completely ignored for a non-existent plot line.It rates a 5.9/10, and that's only because the Dragons are great.the Fiend .

Then there was the fact that even though all of humankind (in this case just a few British and Americans) was under attack, they were ready to kill each other. The setting was England and Americans were there to hunt down the male dragon. They had a lot of weapons and experience, they just lacked the man power. When they solicited the remaining British for help, their leader (Quinn) refused to help, nor let any of his people help, thereby pretty much condemning his community. It was sickening to see someone who's supposed to be the leader being a coward and being satisfied to die cooped up underground.Of course Quinn had to come from underground sooner or later, and he finally did to help slay the male dragon.

A kid (Quinn) with no safety equipment or hard hat or reason for being there, is recklessly urged by one of the construction workers to enter the hole, in which he finds and wakens a hibernating dragon. The dragon escapes, mayhem ensues and the whole globe is devastated by the 'reign of fire' in which thousands of these fire breathing beasties lays waste to everything. Fast forward a couple decades. A bunch of survivors led by now-grown-up Quinn lives in a fortified castle somewhere North of London.They basically sit around and do nothing but wait for a meager tomato (?) harvest to ripen. (For no apparent reason the tomato field is kept outside the castle fortifications). We're told that everybody is starving, which makes for a minor mutiny in the ranks (prompting a fatal tomato plucking raid,) but a bunch of cornfed, rosy-cheeked kids in blue pajamas shows no want or lack of food. Indeed, for a land allegedly devastated by these dragons there's no shortage of neither water or fuel in the castle.Enter the Americans to save the day... Matthew McConaughey chews up the scenery with an unconvincing performance as a dragon slaying Yankee tank commander who shows up with a small batallion of armored vehicles and a helicopter (!).The Americans have determined that the dragons they encounter and kill (with highly improbable aerial acrobatics) are all female, and they're looking for the male of which they surmise there's only one, presumably located in London. Quinn states that the dragon he saw as a kid must be the feller they're looking for, so after some testosterone is spent on growling and scowling and getting blown up, they go to London in the helicopter to kill the beastie and some half hearted love interest is established between the helicopter pilot and Quinn.By the way, please don't ask how a male dragon would spawn a thousand other dragons, or how by destroying him victory would be certain as the plot according to the Yanks would unfold. The egg carrying females would presumably explode in a puff of smoke. Mysteries of reptilian plumbing! This is not even the worst of the plot holes, and the whole writing is absolutely rotten and derivative - it's inconceivable how the X-files director would agree to shoot this dreck.The budget appears to have been largely spent on renting that silly helicopter. Indeed, the production company evidently had to return it in mint condition right after the shoot - they weren't even allowed or able to dirty it up a bit to even pretend the story was supposed to be set in a time where infrastructure and civilization had been absent for decades so the helicopter looks shiny brand new, at odds with the condition of all other vehicles and sets in the movie. Consider also how much fuel is consumed by a helicopter in just a minute, and this thing is flying around near constantly, for hours and days on end. The logistics of supply and maintenance for a perfectly kept helicopter in active use totally don't fit the poorly executed reality of the production, which in every way neglects to establish location or reality in any wayThere's no visual evidence on the screen that any of this takes place in a previously inhabited, civilized world. A simple corroded, bent M25 roadsign shot in post for the helicopter fly-bys would have established England. Or a burnt out pub, or anything. But there's nothing like that, just the (largely intact) castle and endless fields of ash and rubble with no discernible structures, while the laughably poorly done London set where the heart and source of all the destruction was supposed to be set in, looked mostly like a junk yard plopped into the ruins of a newly demolished factory with virtually no trace of fire damage. It's all trash, poorly executed and severely underimagined. This picture has zero redeeming values, and even the other big budget item - the CGI dragons - aren't convincing at all. They fly like something between drunken seagulls and the video f/x shuttlecraft from the equally bad 'V' TV series. The movie in no way manages to establish suspension of disbelief, which is lame because it would have cost very little to achieve it - just a little effort.

Finally all my patients payed off and the film finally opened to the masses.  I must say that I got exactly what I hoped for and was very happy with the end product.All the actors involved did a fantastic job, Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, Izabella Scorupco, and Gerard Butler.  And Matthew looked SO cool in this film!  Izabella looked fabulous as always.  I've got to give some props to director Rob Bowman (X-Files), he has added another fabulous film to his credits.The dragons themselves looked absolutely incredible!  Fantastic job!  There were a few scenes were my mouth hit the floor because I was so impressed with how well the dragons looked.As far as story goes, I was really impressed with the idea of the film and how they explained the existence of dragons.  I had a few problems here and there and I will point them out below.That's about all I can say about the film without giving away anything, so if you haven't seen the film, do not read any further.Possible SPOILERS AHEAD!One story point that I really wish was explained is how one dragon spawned into hundreds of dragons?  But at the same time, maybe it's better that they don't attempt to explain it because then you're in the same position as the characters in the film.  They don't know how it started, all they know is that somehow a dragon got loose and multiplied until they ruled the earth.A second story point that didn't really sit well with me is that there was supposedly only 1 male dragon?  Doesn't that seem a bit too convenient?  But at the same time, the director left it completely open-ended, the characters have no idea for sure if the one they killed was the only male dragon.  And also it occurred to me that this whole story takes place over the course of only 20 years or so, so maybe that was a low enough number of years that only 1 male dragon was produced.  Just something to consider I guess.Finally, the last thing I had a problem with is, near the beginning of the film Quinn (Christian Bale) risks his neck to go out to the fields to save the people from the dragon.  Ok that's cool, but why does the dragon suddenly stop attacking them once they leave?  I heard them mention something like He doesn't care about us, he only wants the ash.  What the heck was that?  That just didn't make sense to me, so what do the dragons eat, ash or meat?  Maybe if I watch the film again it'll make more sense to me.  We'll see.Anyhow, that's about it for the problems I had with the film.  Overall, I thought it was a fantastic movie, and I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes sci-fi or fantasy movies.  Also, if you're a fan of the dragons, then do yourself a favor and scope this out.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did and still do.

And why did they think it would starve to death if it had been buried without food and water for what had to been at least hundreds of thousands of years? At least in Aliens this is explained, shrimp eggs can be dormant for an ungodly amount of time until they come in contact with water. The Alien egg remains dormant until it is exposed to a living host, then it multiplied, which was a plausible explanation in the plot.The plot of this movie just ruined it for me.

No colorful, bright settings, and no other supernatural beings involved(in general, the Fantasy genre listing for this should be taken with a grain of salt). Instead, a post-apocalyptic, dystopian near-future, with an attempt at a scientific explanation for the beasts. The CGI isn't half bad. Why, then, does it suck, do you ask? We can start with McConaughey. Frankly, he looks ridiculous, not to even mention how he sounds(dude, growling does not work for you, and permanently abstaining from it in the future is in the best interest of us all). Fitting though his appearance may seem, it's silly, even in context. The plot has rather gaping holes, ones that could have easily been worked around if the writers could have gotten over what must have been a major crush on the vastness of the main concept. Apart from those, it does have good(or less awful, at the very least). The acting ranges. I don't know if this intended to be an action flick, but it does not have enough to pass as such. As a suspense movie, it's decent. It's low on stupid popcorn moments. Dialog varies. The tone is dark, with little to no humor, and arguably relatively little Hollywood to it.

She erroneously sets free a fire-breathing dragon that brings chaos to the modern world. Fast forward to 2020 where Quinn (Christian Bale) is fighting the battle of survival with a handful of his men. Apparently, they have devised mechanisms to warn them of the beast's arrival, but actually fighting one is quite a challenge. Enter Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), a tough-talking American looking for shelter with Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco), a daredevil helicopter pilot. Zan claims to have killed quite a few dragons using a technique that not only sounds far-fetched, but also ridiculous.Quinn soon figures out that Zan and his men are completely insane. He asks them to leave and resists as Zan plans to recruit his men to finish off the flame spewing creatures. However, when Zan reveals there is just one male dragon hiding in London and producing millions of offspring, Quinn decides to join forces with him to encounter the beast one last time.ROF portrays Americans yet again as the sole saviours of the world. Although we have adored dragons in movies like Dragonheart and Dungeons & Dragons, ROF brings to the screen their might and terror. The director, who has movies such as Airborne and The X-Files to his credit fails to electrify the viewer with more drama than action, unimposing special effects and a weak storyline.

The idea alone that a bunch of ancient dragons in the modern world set in the new apocalypse and destroyed all the cities and killing basically every person on Earth, is an highly unlikely one. A movie with an unlikely concept and premise is per definition an unlikely and far from believable or likable movie. In the end the movie is just as silly as it at first sight sounds, even for a genre movie like this one.Problem is that the movie is totally lacking in good suspenseful action sequences. The fact that the movie is lacking in good action and tension absolutely has something to do with it that the movie never gets believable enough. The post-apocalypse world the movie is set in feels like it comes straight out of Waterworld or Mad Max. It also doesn't exactly make the movie original although the premise in its core is of course definitely new and original.Also the fact that the story is rather simple makes that this movie feels far from original or likable enough. They didn't attempt to make the movie any more interesting by putting more meaningful plot lines in it. There are plenty of enough characters in the movie though to do something more interesting with, story-wise.It is definitely not the actor's fault that the characters don't work out. I mean when you've a cast with Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Izabella Scorupco and Gerard Butler, you can't accuse the movie of bad acting but you can accuse it of having bad characters and dialog. The Christian Bale character is supposed to be the main character but his character remains so shallow and uninteresting that you never really ever care much about him. I think that it would had been way better if the main character was an heroic one. A real action-hero, also perhaps played by a more likely action-hero star. It ironically is Matthew McConaughey in his totally over-the-top tough guy role that delivers the best performance of the movie and also puts down the most interesting character. He perhaps plays the most fun role out of his career (yet).The special effects are definitely not that bad but they way they are used are bad. Too many wide-shots and not enough close-ups. The movie could had also used way more sequences with the dragons in it and more action sequences in general. It would had made the movie at least more fun and interesting to watch. The dragons just don't feel as big destructive monsters in the movie, which also adds to the reason why the movie is lacking in good suspenseful or believable action.Further more the movie is definitely good looking with some good cinematography from Adrian Biddle and good looking sets and costumes. The directing is also quite good but it could had used more depth and creativity at times. Still I think that Rob Bowman should be given another chance, since he definitely has the potential as a director to make some good, fun but yet simple action, science-fiction and/or fantasy movies, one day.I wouldn't exactly recommend watching it, although it sure is still a watchable enough one.

What appears to be a trend of cashing in on such films as the charming Harry Potter and the beautifully visual Lord Of The Rings we have Reign Of Fire. Another trend seems to be studios producing films that are so enthusiastic about their latest computer technology the plot takes a back seat. Lets take an idea, concentrate on visuals, concentrate on technology, concentrate on opium for the masses, concentrate on marketing then , oh, lets get a plot together. Wrong formula, have a story first use wizardry to enhance the story after all who in their right mind would start to build a house starting with the windows or colour scheme- shouldn't you have foundations first ? I am sure the writers of this film used a coffee break to churn out this gruelling cinematic abortion. The director has used some 'pleasent' touches, the contemporary medievalistic feel is amicably achieved. There is also a moment of exciting 'chased through the air by pursuing monsters' direction which was alright, well it stopped me admiring my friends wallpaper and return to concentrating on the film (which was pretty easy to do as we had all worked out the flabby plot, beginning,middle and end within the first 10-15 minutes). Why the hell they didn't stick with the monsters hatching, monsters attack,mankind battles dragons in key cities around the world-theme,is completely beyond me. Perhaps the studio felt this was too complex for the intended audience, which must have been either children or morons. The characters themselves were suitably tepid , Chrisitian Bale (did he wear false teeth in this movie ?)done his testosterone filled hero bit (yawn!) The Dragons incinerating and munching through the last straggling survivors were hilarious, I found it amusing, not because I am especially warped but because I couldn't care less. The dragons themselves were naughty and the CGI used looked, well, um , like Computer Generated Imagery ! This is dire vacuousness at its worst.If we are to believe that mankind used all of his aggressiveness against these critters including nuclear bombs then surely they wouldn't be able to slay and save in 2020 a.d. Oh forgot, perhaps humanity at this stage are so hard core they are immune to radiation sickness, cancers and other genetic nasties caused by nuclear war. At least the Reign Of Fire creators could of tried to make at least some elements of this crud tangible. This however is based on one persons view but I would strongly advised to those who have not sat through this chore, if you like to save time and money - go the pub, go on the net for 100 minutes , go and see long lost relatives anything you like but try to refrain from viewing this abomination. After all its nothing new and to be honest there will no doubt be a few more turkeys just waiting to be rushed, oops made i mean, to hit a local mainstream cinema near you.I bet from reading the summary you were expecting an appraisal, and if you are a fan of the film you may feel let down and cheated with the end result -WELL SO WAS I WITH THIS!

It figures that the one time a film has a good story, good actors and good special effects, that the director spoils everything.

But at least you may miss the more subtle of these errors if you get well and truly lagered up before attending.It is also true that the CGI - which you might expect to be spectacular in a twenty-first century movie about dragons - is mediocre, being often blurred, mist-shrouded, badly proportioned, moving unnaturally, and rarely showing live dragons in the same scene as men, animals etc. Once again, the beer goggles should sort that out.It is also true that despite some reasonable and occasionally good bits of acting from Christopher Bale and Matthew McConaughey, most of the characters are so two dimensional you have to read the credits to discover that they had names. This is not a problem for a beer-and-pretzels movie.Despite all the above, my problem is that this film had the feel of a very cheap, hastily made production which is hoping to make enough money to fund the (rather blatantly telegraphed) prequel and sequel. At 100 min it is quite a short movie which literally skips most of its suggested beginning with a quick voiceover, and then wraps up with numerous problems unanswered! (An example of the cheapness is that the voiceover near the start is accompanied by shots of prop _magazine covers_, without moving pictures or even close-up stills.)There just isn't that much that _happens_ in this movie. There is a brief intro, the somewhat odd attack on the veggie patch, the killing of the veggie patch dragon with an over-elaborate scheme that is never re-used, the attack on the castle shown mostly from a distance, and the climax. Each of these major 'Acts' is interspersed with some human interaction, but except for the arrival of the American militiamen and a fist fight these are brief dialogues with perhaps one line of stage direction. Trying not to give too much away, the total number of dragons slain in this movie is small, and all dragons successfully slain are killed instantaneously when struck by fairly small, low tech weapons.For example, for the climactic battle they are instantaneously transported to dragon central, briefly watch a bit of draconian disunity in the distance, scurry along a short tunnel Quinn just happens to know about, and voila, they are in the (rather uninteresting) lair of the beast. Couldn't they have at least one setback along the way? How about a few charred bones in the lair? Since the train carriage was presumably dropped there by the dragon, how about a few more signs of things he's snacked on in his lair, like a torn open double-decker bus, another dragon, or a colliery barge (mmm, tasty ash!) ?All I can say is that in the sequel, I hope they have to work a bit harder to get their dragon!

I've seen it now and it looks like I was right, Reign of Fire didn't satisfy me at all. First of all there's the ( always growing bigger) problem of the CGI. I mean, do they really have to do everything with a computer nowadays ? I realize this is to satisfy the younger and more enthousiastic crowd, but I so much preferred the dragons ( and other monsters ) in those lovely B-movies from the 50's.  Sure you saw they were hand-made but hey, these flying puppies in Reign of Fire don't look very realistic neither, do they ? At least the old movies had much more love in them...I must be getting very old.But, if this would have been the only negative element about it, I wouldn't consider it a total disaster yet. Too bad there ARE more problems with it. The script totters in every possible way and the climax ??? Well, I'm sorry to say this if you were stunned by seeing the ending but you can actually see it coming from a mile away... As soon as the boy discovers the first dragon in the mine, a bell should start ringing. Reign of Fire suffers from an enormous lack of originality. It all may look very impressive but we've all seen it multiple times before...and better. The only real positive comments I've got are for Christian Bale. No, not Matthew McConaughey because I've seen him acting a lot better already ( in the recent Frailty for example ). McConaughey is an average actor, his career is a mixed combination of good and bad roles so far...This is most certainly a bad one. Christian Bale on the other hand rarely gives away a bad performance. He really broke through with American Psycho but also his earlier films are surely worth a look. If you consider him handsome, cute or whatever ( or maybe you just think he's a great actor ) I recommend to see this movie...only for him. If not  avoid it.

They are trying to raise crops and such and avoid the dragons for they have no shot at stopping their onslaught. That is until this group lead by Matthew comes and tells them of their plan to stop the dragons once and for all. They even fly helicopters, unafraid of the dragons that fly the skies. They have managed to track down the source beast and its hiding grounds, seems like all the dragons are females save for one and it is the guy dragon that must be killed. This movie plays out pretty good for the most part, you see lots of dragons, but quite frankly they all look exactly the same. Even the male dragon looks like all the others, only bigger. They need more variations or something. Also, a more thrilling ending could have been used as it is not as good of an action scene as I was anticipating for the end fight.

He wasn't quite sure if he ought to mention it, but from Kristl's eighties punk look, with her short hair, sturdy black leather jacket, worn jeans and high laced army boots, he gathered that she was not going to give a toss.That alone should be good for big haul. Who doesn't want to see dragons? Henry said.Well, people will be disappointed no doubt. It is not like there are that many to see. Dragons is plural.. I can't recall to have seen more than one up close in any one scene. If they had not killed one to show there are two, it might as well have been only one dragon. The dragon.But when you get to see one it looks really cool. I know people moan at cgi, but I liked the way they did those dragons.One dragon. They just made one dragon and then reused it. The big male one they kill at the end looked just like the female one they killed earlier in the movie. They did not even bother to give it another color. Just because it was male.. or something. Or different. Little lacking details. Kristl added.Anyway there were dragons, cool ferocious dragons. Fire Breathing dragons.Exploding dragons..And for the rest it awash just hogwash..the story was just laughable. Somewhere under London sleep dragons and when they are woken they start destroying life as we know it, just like they had done before with the dinosaurs for instance, so the over-voice tells u.. I wonder how people found out about it, did the dragons tell them?I liked the scenes where they try to kill one by throwing a net on them and use people as bait. Really cool. Yeah, that was a cool scene. Cool scenes are far in between though, mostly you see dirty scruffy men in brown-gray rags sneering at each other. They never get along or develop in any sense. Many movies have a group of reluctant people who have to team up to solve a problem. They eventually start to respect each other even if they don't agree. This movie has no such development. Nothing changes in the persons themselves.And eventually everyone dies..Haha. Henry laughed, almost everyone, that is. Only the guy and the girl remain.And not one joke or witty line. I mean a movie like that should have some relief. Some moments of humor to break the continuous gloom that pervades, but I can't remember one intentional joke or witty remark, Not even sarcasm. Just two guys bickering for the sake of bickering. Yeah. They could have added some jokes in it.I also can't say there was exceptionally or interesting scenes in this one. The only memorable screen moment is when the American dragon hunter jumped from that two with an axe to attack the main dragon.So basically a grim humorless movie that has nothing working for it but some cgi dragons that some might like and others might hate. Especially considering the lack of dragon movies overallThat is the gist of it. Kristl nodded.Which reminds me. Henry said and he reached down to open a box, I wanted to celebrate the movie with this. He took out a few bottles.

Even action movies I'm not a fan of, boring is not the word I'd use to describe them. With this film, it's a strange scenario; I guess I have a low tolerance for films that feature gigantic, fire-breathing dragons and loud, listless characters shouting in thick, often incomprehensible British accents.The story begins with a young boy named Quinn, who is on-location, admiring the constructing of the London Underground where his mother works. During the construction, the workers awake a gigantic dragon from its hibernation and pay the lethal price of getting incinerated. Quinn and his mother try to escape via loading elevator, but the dragon kills the mother when he flies out of the building, leaving poor Quinn alone. Now it's ten years later, in 2020, and Quinn (Christian Bale) is leading a group of people, who have been forced to leave everything and barricade themselves inside a large castle in Northumberland. London, and possibly the rest of the world, has become taken over and destroyed by large dragons. Quinn has his survivalist group under control, until Americans Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) and Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco) arrive to fight back the beasts, leaving him at a quandary. All of his men and women want the same goal, but they want to achieve it through ways of power, leadership, and integrity.This little detail alone certainly could've posed a great power struggle between the men, but the film is so repetitive, bleak, tonally obnoxious, and uninteresting that one doesn't even seem to mind the lame direction the film takes. This is what you define as lazy disaster filmmaking; mix two separate time periods, throw in robotic characters, neglect all parts of humanity and depth, and market it to those who want to see dragons and nothing more.Not to mention, isn't it odd how Hollywood can find the most ridiculous things to exploit but there has been a stunning absence of dragon films in the last few decades? Reign of Fire gets points for having a few unique and somewhat interesting instances like where the fire-breathing behemoth leader (?) of them all swoops down and breathes a fire big enough to burn an entire city. Scenes like that have the tendency to leave a viewer with optimism for the remainder of the film, until they realize that it has nothing much else to offer other than repetitive action sequences, a large amount of incomprehensible shouting, and redundant character quibbles on top of convenient melodrama.If there's one saving grace to this film, other than having one solid scene every thirty minutes, it's the music, done by Edward Shearmur, who prior to this scored the wonderful Kevin Spacey drama K-PAX, beautifully and subtly. Sure, these are two different films, but Shearmur puts in a surprising amount of tension and craft behind the music in this film. When what's on screen fails me, I then employ secondary senses to pick up what ordinary viewers might not even think twice about.Reign of Fire features two early performances of Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey, both men who started out their careers a tad rocky, yet went on to find different little performances they could work extremely well in. Living in the present, it's sad that it was just around eleven years ago they were giving ho-hum performances in a forgettable actioneer when they would both become recognized for their achievements in difficult, but rewarding roles. The circle of Hollywood life works in odd ways.Starring Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, Izabella Scorupco, and Gerard Butler. Directed by Rob Bowman.

In a future world dominated by dragons, Quinn (Bale) leads the resistance located in Northumberland having seen his mother attacked and killed by a dragon as a child.Apart from some decent action and fantastic effects there's nothing much to like about Reign Of Fire as the story seems to flop after a decent opening 10 minutes in which a young Quinn goes to visit his construction worker mother working in the tube tunnels, where Quinn first feasts his eyes on a dragon as 2 of his mothers co workers are incinerated instantly with Quinn barely escaping and his mother unfortunate enough to be killed saving him. From there the only highs are a sky diving attack to try and catch a dragon and bale trying to outrun a flying dragon on a horse.After that the movie just loses steam and seems to run out of ideas as Denton (Matthew McConaughey) an American dragon hunter arrives to temp Quinn and Quinns men into helping him kill the male dragon located in London, for Quinn to decline then later on accept.Finally the final battle just seems to not know whether it wants to be clever or brilliant action, in the end its neither and at times the actors don't really look bothered.

IT SIMPLY WOULD NOT HAPPEN. The construction industry has the highest accident and fatality rate of all industries in the western world and would no more allow a child on-site than - a dragon. In London, England; where this is supposed to have taken place, there is a clearly advertised rule 'No Hat, No Boots, No Job.' It refers to safety clothing, and the sack if you're caught without them. The same also applies to reflective tunics. And yet this kid is not only free to roam in flagrant breach of this fundamental safety rule; he is allowed into the deep excavation unsupervised on the lift. Gimme a break. Those involved would be sacked on the spot. And all this, apparently at the discretion of his own mother. She is down the hole, working as some kind of supervisory bod in the 'power-female' role that has now become mandatory in today's movies no matter how daft the circumstances (anyone ever seen a woman on a construction site? Does Jimmy Choo make a range of stiletto safety boots?). Further; his evident familiarity with the site and its personnel make it clear that such forays are regular and considered normal. This is so ridiculous, and demonstrates such a complete lack of the most basic research of the real world that - for me - the movie as good as ends here. It is already too fantastic to bother watching.Still; one perseveres. After a great gout of fire and the shadowy outline of one dragon, the world comes to an abrupt end. We see nothing of it. An apparent airborne battle between beasties and helicopter gunships over the skies of London, alluded to in the publicity shots never arises. It's just a cheap, shabby con. Instead, we enter a post-apocalyptic world of ash and spoil-heaps, with belligerent groups of loud-mouthed survivors and all of the weary-worn predictable clichés entailed. About the only thing missing is Arthur Scargill.It's boring. It's dull. Situations have reversed; now dragons rule the surface world and humans live in caverns. Lighting is so gloomy that it might as well have been filmed in black & white. The dragons apparently eat ash, but what do humans eat? A small garden of what look like tomatoes surely won't go very far. Where's the protein coming from? Once again we're left guessing because the director didn't stop to think. The young boy (his irresponsible mum got killed in the excavation) is now a grown man and leader, in an idea clearly ripped-off from the 'Terminator' franchise.The Brits bicker and argue until Yanks come to the rescue. Hooray for the Yanks. The Yanks have tanks, but as usual they prove useless. These dragons are worse than the Taliban. Apparently, our transatlantic heroes use helicopters, sky-divers and nets to catch the beasties in-flight, in an idea so utterly absurd that it could only have been included for the sake of a bit of cheap aerial drama. They've also discovered that almost every dragon is female (no surprises there then), and that just one male services them all. How did they discover this? Don't ask. How did they come to be so numerous so quickly in the first place then? Again; don't ask. But bump-off this flying Lothario and humanity is home and dry. The species will just die out.Well, not necessarily so. A species that evolved with just one seed-carrier would never have survived without an evolutionary contingency. And many reptiles have one. They can change gender. By simply altering the temperature at which eggs incubate, the sex of hatchlings can be manipulated - a phenomenon made manifest in 'Jurassic Park'. So think again.However, in this movie it works, and that's that. There's so much to criticise and so little to praise. Let me at least say that I like the dragons. As a piece of CGI hokum they are very nicely realised, both in the air and on the ground. It looks as if they're were the big money got spent. Beyond them, you rummage through the rubble. This movie could have been a corker. We might have at least glimpsed the reptilian take-over. Jumbo-jets attacked in flight, cruise-liners beset at sea, the great cities of the world under siege. But that would beg the question - how did we lose? With such extensive arsenals of smart weaponry throughout the world, and such huge, comparatively slow-moving targets; it should have been a turkey-shoot. Apart from that, lighting is poor, acting is wooden, and the script is banal. Editing is also a little haphazard. 'Reign Of Fire' is what happens when you put an idea with great cinematic potential into the hands of a shallow dimwit who focuses on effects and predictable drama rather than story and research. Perhaps he was hampered by a limited budget. But not half so much as by a lack of common sense.Very disappointing. Worth a watch, but not a purchase.

The post-apocalyptic remnants of middle-class society are holed up in a castle, menaced this time not by Mohawked bikers but by fire-breathing dragons, which are pretty scary but have too little screen time. In fact they skimped on all the good stuff in this one.After a distressingly dragon-light prologue, we spend redundant idle minutes establishing the hierarchy of the dwindling band of nice people, before Mad Max (a bullet-headed, triple-triceped McConaughey) drives his tank into the courtyard and incites a new world order. The part of Mad Max's faithful dog is played here by Izabella Scorupco, who sounds like a joke and is a ravishing blonde Kentucky National Guard pilot with a middle-European accent.The philosophy of the film is that some guys are dragonslayers, and some guys are dragonslayers who don't know it yet. McConaughey is charged with persuading us that he has jumped out of helicopters and stabbed dragons to death, and he is one of the only actors alive whom we would believe when he says such a thing. We see early on that Christian Bale has an underwear-model's build, very butch, but he is forced to wear a sweater in all his scenes with McConaughey, putting the Brit at an unfair disadvantage. Bale's work in American Psycho and The Machinist is as good as anybody's giving these days, and for every Sahara or Failure to Launch, the shirt-challenged McConaughey delivers a Lone Star or a Frailty or a Dazed and Confused. But the director really fails here, because what should be a series of great scenes between two intense young actors - a buddy movie at least - turns into a dumbshow where the best elements are sent off alone to do battle with computer generated monsters (too few too late) instead of interacting and giving us some drama.And for the last time - refugees are unphotogenic, therefore uncinematic. Stop with the post-apocalyptic-culture-in-need-of-a-superman movies. It's a weak premise anyway, because the only good part of Road Warrior is when Max is fighting the bad guys, and the sentimental hooey back on the ranch is never worth fighting for. An important premise of lone warrior movies is that the lone warrior IS ALONE, so he can't really have a love interest, nor much incentive to save those unwashed, scurvy refugees. And if we grant that the genre has had some excellent entries - Kurt Russel's Soldier notwithstanding - what are you gonna do with it that hasn't been done badly 50 times before - three times by Costner alone, if you count Dances with Wolves. Four times with Robin Hood, if the Crusades count as apocalyptic. Five times if you count The Bodyguard - Whitney Houston as a movie star must be a sign of the end times.

I was sort of hoping it would be another gem in the Battlefield Earth mold. Yes, it's a silly movie, but by no means anywhere nearly as bad as Travolta's ode to Ed Wood. Full of unanswered questions and gaps in logic, but within reason - or have we all been so dumbed-down by the Armageddons and The Cores of the movie world, so as not to get too upset any more when absurd crap stares us right in the face? Whenever I see people in rags, covered with soot, I think I don't really wanna watch this ugly crap. And what's with all those kids? Is Bale running an orphanage in his fortress? Mad Max II certainly didn't have these many kid survivors, which definitely made it less unrealistic than ROF. For every one adult there seemed to be 100 kids, as if this male dragon fertilized human females, too, not just the dragon ones.So many questions, so little space (the 1000-word IMDb limit). How is it that the whole world, while still intact, couldn't figure out everything that Van Zan and his merry band of vanzandarinos realized about the dragons? This is the essential problem of the movie no matter how they glued a happy ending on this movie, it could not make sense. There is just NO WAY that all the military might and scientific brain-power of the world failed to bring down the dragons - and yet one arrow kills this one male and - voila! - it's all over. (Piece o' cake! Piece o' cake!, to quote characters from Battlefield Earth.) Besides, would humans be so stupid as to nuke all the cities, what with all the ultra-precise weaponry that the most powerful nations have developed over the last decades?? Throwing an atomic bomb to kill a couple of dragons is such overkill that I wouldn't even trust the insane general in Dr.Strangelove to opt for it! How can Van Zan (spiffing name) be sure there is only one male? Maybe somewhere in Indonesia a small male dragon is going through puberty, discovering the joys of masturbation and preparing to take over the fertilization chores of the old Cockney London male dragon geezer. And why did this one male dragon hang around London? Was he homesick? Does he like freckled redheads? Every time he went off to, say, Zambia, to fertilize eggs he'd feel he has to go back to the London's East End? A Cockney dragon indeed. And how did Van Zan know that this male was in London? Did the dragon send him e-mails taunting him to dare come to London and kill him? I'd also like to know why the dragons waited for SO LONG to finally reappear. We're told in the intro that they waited until the food supplies, i.e. humans and animals, finally recovered from the dragons' uncontrolled and badly planned dining habits. So why did they not appear 2000 years ago? There were plenty of humans and animals back then; certainly not nearly as many humans, granted, but plenty of animals, surely...That reminds me there is no mention of animals. Are they on the dragons' menu, too?Apart from the vanzanillions of questions, the movie suffers from focusing too much on irrelevant detail. There are all these relationships between various characters which we simply don't care about. This is supposed to be a 100-minute action movie, hence if you're incapable of writing good dialogue to make the characters' interactions interesting (as in Star Wars), then just leave it be - and GET ON WITH IT. I also thought that Bale and Van Zan having a punch-up was just too silly.Oh, I nearly forgot. When the blonde, Van Zan, and Bale go to London in the big finale, how is it they only fight the male dragon? If my memory serves me correctly, there were dozens if not hundreds of dragons in the sky when the human trio arrived. Surely the male didn't eat all those females in 5 minutes??!! And even if he did (or they ate each other and he ate the rest) why would that happen at the EXACT TIME when our merry world-saving trio appears? Talk about a coincidence. Talk about full-blown nonsense. Another far-fetched coincidence is that Bale, who is from what I understood the first to witness the first dragon, is the ONE to kill him decades later. Come on...

The effects are great, but not fully utilized enough, too. Gerard Butler is riotous for the first half an hour, but then he just disappears until his death, and Bale is rather bland here; McConaughey is great, though. There's some great post-apocalyptic ideas played with at the beginning (like when they re-enact The Empire Strikes Back) and I wished it could have stayed the road of sci-fi drama instead of action flick, but oh well.

Christian Bale play's Quinn, boy turned man, who first discovers them after visiting his mother at the site. The story continues twenty years later, when the Earth is parched and dust laden. Small bands of survivors are held up in a stone fortress in the barren English Countryside. Scratching for food and ever fearful of attack. At their lowest ebullience, help arrives in the form of Denton Van Zan and his renegade army of American Marines. Well cast, Matthew McConaughey is the zealous leader of the Dragon Slayers, who takes control of this band of English destitute's. Ego's clash and leaders fight for command, during which both camps lose heavily, due to Dragon's and short sightedness. The grand finale is set in a magnificently incinerated and skeletal London Town with the two leading men and Alex Jensen, the US helicopter pilot fighting against the Alpha Male for the survival of the Human Race. This is a well cast movie, with the likes of Messer's Bale and McConaughey playing along side the ever beautiful and talented Polish actress Izabella Scorupco as the US pilot.Winning the Catalonian International Film Festival Award, Spain, for Best Visual Effects by Richard R.

So with anticipation I watched it.I have to say the film was for me just about OK. Not what I expected, But not too bad either.I originally thought it was going to be like nations and modern armies against dragons, sort of like Godzilla, instead it was the story of a band of English survivors and a small army of Americans who show up at the English fortress who have come up with a way to kill dragons. Not what I expected but entertaining nonetheless.The story was OK, There are major plot holes, and a major degree of unrealism (How did the Americans get to the UK?, How come they have unlimited fuel, The dragons seem easy to kill, why didn't we kill them with bowguns?) but it was a relatively entertaining film I would have to say that McNaughey does the best acting job, second to Bale, but both are exceptional actors.What most impressed me about this film was the settings, and how artistic a London in ruins looked at the end of the film. The helicopter sequences are also very nicely done.

He came up with this strange way of dragon catching which involves using a sky diving team to be used as human bait, which brings out the question of how they practice that kind of thing. Finally, at the end of the film when the male dragon is dead, all of the female dragons suddenly stop attacking? Did they go into depression because their gigolo is gone?

I should've acted on it and gone back to the video store.There are some good, tense action sequences, but overall, Reign of Fire is only so-so. I'll have to admit, though, that it takes a bit of talent to start with a fairly original idea and drown it in clichés and predictability - all in 102 minutes. *Warning Don't read before watching, major spoilers ahead*There are a lot of problems with this movie, the most obvious being the great many things that just simply don't hang together. A kid allowed to go unsupervised into a London Underground construction site? Really? Dragons buried underground for most of history? So what do they eat? And later on, they're starving? Why don't they just go hibernate again? Oh, and the first kid to see a dragon ends up being one of the very last people left alive on earth? What are the odds of that? Given the high-maintenance nature of helicopters, I wondered just how the heck they managed to keep that one in the air. Alex must be one heck of a helicopter mechanic. Not to mention that the relatively slow-moving helicopter is entirely a sitting duck for the far more nimble dragons. Fuel? I guess this model doesn't need it. Wish I could get in on that technological breakthrough. How about an entire species that depends for its survival on one single individual? Huh? I can guaran-darn-tee such a species wouldn't be around for long. And in the entire 20-year history of the destruction of close to 6 billion people, nobody on the entire planet noticed the dragons' weakness until now? Oh... and the dragons are NOT defeatable using all the modern high-tech weaponry the world's nations have to offer, but if you've got a bow and arrow with a few ounces of C4, you can take one of those bad boys down?By the way, why didn't a LOT of people simply dig in underground and wait for these creatures to starve? So much for the basic premises. Plot-wise, maybe I didn't need the spoiler warning, you can see what's coming anyway. In the scene leading up to the, um, climax of the film, one of the main characters gives a rousing little speech Now we have a chance to make a difference.You're going to die, I replied out loud to the screen.

When Quinn picks up van Zan's axe, it's such a cliché it almost made me shudder with revulsion.Still, Reign of Fire isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and like I mentioned, there are some exciting action scenes, and the dragon is reasonably cool. I'll give RoF about a 3 or 4 out of 10, largely based on the effects and action. Slightly below average, but there's an awful lot of awful stuff being produced.

Unfortunately the producers seemed to have lacked imagination and showed contempt for the audience. The plot sleepwalked through the film, cliches abound, and the plot holes are large enough to get lost in. The film was still fun, but could have been much, much better, with a little effort.-spoilers-How did the hero know that the sole (!!) male dragon was the one he saw some 20 years ago. How did he know it would still be in the same hole. With the city of London in ruins, how could he even have found the site?The formerly vast and rapidly expanding (when food exists) population of dragons were dependent on one male. If there was just the one male to start with, how did they multiply at all? That the audience is expected to swallow these biological absurdities is astonishing.If nuclear weapons were used against the dragons in major cities, why was London still more or less intact, since it was the source of the scourge? It would in reality be a radioactive wasteland.If the colony was afraid of dragons attacking them when they tended their crops, why didn't they try to camouflage them? The nursery was so far away that it would be impossible to safely reach it from the castle. If the crop was not yet ready to harvest, why were the fruits so red and juicy?Why did over 200 Americans fly to northern England- Northumberland is nowhere near London- to assist the Brits. Pity the country that needs heroes. It seemed that the arrogant yanks had either been forced from their own country- and the rudeness masked insecurity- or they had some ulterior motives in coming to northern England. Yet after being easily decimated by dragons, it appears that the visitors story (that they had simply wanted to kill dragons) was true after all. But why did they leave America to do it, and why were they so unsuccesful in England after supposedly killing hundreds of dragons in America?Incidentally, no National Guard C5 Galaxy could carry a tank, several heavy trucks, a helicopter, 200 men, and supplies. No wonder they crashed. After 20 years the avgas would be bad, assuming that they hadn't run out of reserves.The celebrating refugees seemed to be making as much noise as possible. That and the floodlights suggested that they wanted to attrack the dragons. Surely their ethos was to stay low and avoid detection. There was dozens if not hundreds of adults, yet when six were forced to go to London with the Americans only a few adults remained. Stranger still, when the dragon attacked the castle the remaining adults were all killed, leaving only children. Odd to say the least.The dragons must have a very efficient intelligence system to know that the attacking Americans came from the Nothumberland castle. Unless they were being watched all along, which begs the question- why weren't they attacked before?If bombs didn't block the road to London, and no humans had, surely it isn't implied that the dragons had themselves blocked the roads! A huge flying repile would have neither the ability nor the need to create roadblocks.The stupidest part of the film is the reliance on technology combined with suicidal tactics. After 20 years of chaos, fire, and EMP's, there would be no working electronics worth speaking of. The aircraft would be permanently grounded, and 3-D imaging wouldn''t work.

Anything. At the ground level, `Reign of Fire' has got to be the most high-concept Dragon movie in years. And it still manages to be a total bore. It's almost as if they made an effort to keep out all the creativity and excitement that this movie could have been laced with.`Reign of Fire' (a title that almost sounds pretentious) picks up after dragons have emerged from deep in the Earth and nearly exterminated the human race. That's the first mistake of a movie that amounts to a plethora of missed opportunities. The movie glosses over what would have been much more interesting movie about the battle between mankind and a race of dragons in favor of following a band of survivors in a dreary post-apocalyptic future. It feels assembled off the cutting room floor from the scraps of a bigger, better movie. There are ideas here and there like when the movie gives us it's explanation for how the dragons breathe fire. The best scene is one where skydivers jet toward the ground in an effort to capture a flying dragon in a net. It doesn't make a lick of sense even in the rules set-up by the movie, but it is at least a lively action set-piece.The stars of the show are obviously the visual effects used to bring the dragons the life. I wonder how much Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale got paid to wear long dreadlocks and lend their names to the credit above the title. The effects are remarkably detailed, but they also have a detached quality to them. They don't have the feel of existing in real space. Director Rob Bowman (`The X-Files` movie) never gets us down and dirty in there with them. The dragons are almost always at a distance as if to make it obvious that our heroes are crawling around in front of a blue screen. Bowman, himself, proves useless to the proceedings. Even in life-and-death, save-the-world situations he fails to generate the slightest rise out of the audience. He approaches this movie with the same banal style that works on a straight-drama like `The X-Files' but doesn't fly when the audience is expecting to see a big, blistering roller-coaster action movie.

That one scene has more dramatic tension and entertainment than all of Reign of Fire.This classic case of how to take something with lots of potential and almost totally fail to deliver reportedly cost $95 million, but most of it must have gone on Matthew McConaughey's workouts and tattoos, because Touchstone Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment didn't get much else of it on screen. The poster image of dragons attacking London, as all too many others have pointed out, doesn't actually occur in the movie - in fact, most of the movie is set in Northumberland, not a standard setting even for British movies, let alone American ones like this (I don't care if this is officially A United Kingdom/Ireland Co-Production, this one is Hollywood's fault), and apart from the first scene where the dragon is unearthed in the capital of England - no, Mark Radclyffe fans, not Manchester - devastated country landscapes drenched in Adrian Biddle's intentionally washed-out cinematography rule the day.Perhaps to avoid accusations of overdoing the FX, director Rob Bowman and writers Gregg Chabot, Matt Peterka and Matt Greenberg put the emphasis on the people living in the castle around which the action revolves, which is in itself no bad thing... but a director who can handle big action moments helps in situations like this, as does a script which builds proper characters and develops a strong threat instead of coming up with a cross between Godzilla (the Emmerich version, alas) and Twister. In the latter movie, the monsters were forces of nature, not sentient threats, so that movie at least had an excuse for not being able to characterise the enemy, but here the people are battling something and it doesn't register, in part because the dragons aren't used enough.As a result, it undercuts the work of the movie's real stars - ladies and gentlemen, I give you visual effects supervisor Richard R. Hoover, co-visual effects supervisor Dan DeLeeuw, digital effects supervisor John Murrah, CG animation supervisor Eamonn Butler, creature supervisor Rob Dressel, animal anatomy consultant Stuart Sumida and dragon concept consultant Matt Codd - and means we're stuck with Bowman successfully capturing the grimness of this future world but failing to deliver a rousing adventure or even making us care. There's an early sign of culture clash when a character says There's only one thing worse than dragons... Americans, but most of the conflict between McConaughey and the group's leader Christian Bale is based on personality - or as much of it as they have (and McConaughey's valiant attempts to be tough aside, he does deliver more of a performance than anyone else).Edward Shearmur's score deserves a better framework than it gets (and an end title suite instead of a flipping song!), and I'm convinced that Disney's closure of their in-house effects company The Secret Lab has more to do with this movie's (deserved) box-office failure than TSL's work in it, but when you see a movie about a world under attack from deadly fire-breathing critters and the highlight is characters performing a scene from The Empire Strikes Back for the children in their care, something's wrong. The director may have past history on The X-Files, but one wishes the makers of Reign of Fire could have channeled the spirits of Sam Raimi or Joss Whedon instead of Chris Carter.

The year is twenty years from today. Fire-breathing dragons have taken over the world, destroying everything in their wake, leaving just a few iron-willed survivors who live a primitive lifestyle, have become very muscular and apparently like to take off their shirts when they work. Their leader, Quinn (Christian Bale) is a moral, principled man who just wants to protect his extended family from the dragons and lead a decent life inside his castle. This utopian dream is upset one day when Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) shows up at his front gate. Van Zan is a buff American Dragon Slayer who says things like `Let's rock and roll!' when going into battle with the fire-breathing demons; the kind of guy who pours testosterone on his Wheaties in the morning. With veins popping and eyes bulging McConaughey chews every bit of scenery in sight, sometimes threatening to bite clean through the screen and assail the audience. Bale struggles to turn Quinn into something more than a cardboard character, and as a result never achieves the over-the-top quality of McConaughey. Reign of Fire was directed by Rob Bowman, best known for helming The X-Files on television. He knows a thing or two about how to create a foreboding atmosphere, but his action sequences fall flat. The battle scenes are over-edited to the point where the viewer can't tell who is who and what they are doing. It dulls impact of the scene when you can't really tell what is happening on the screen. If you find pumped-up and shirtless heroes entertaining you might like Reign of Fire. If not, stay home and rent Dragonslayer instead.

This movie is similar to Roland Emmerich's Godzilla in that it's a monster movie that spends much of its running time having people talk about the monster, instead of the movie showing the monster. I don't believe it would have been necessary for dragons to be onscreen every single minute, because there has to be a short reprieve once or twice, just to let the story breathe, but the dragons MUST be more of a presence. Otherwise it's just a bunch of dirty people sitting around talking about how scary the dragons are. I was expecting to see ninety minutes of desperate humans in tanks and helicopters battling to kick some scaly dragon butt. That only happened a couple times, and most of the time they were just running away. This movie tries to take time to develop its characters, but it's not necessary. Their character would come out while they're fighting dragons. That's how it really works; the way people truly are will always emerge in stressful situations. This movies goes on for ten or fifteen minutes at a time, trying to be some kind of drama about surrogate fatherhood, then a dragon flies by and scares everybody except the audience, then it compares natural leadership to acquired leadership to forced leadership, then they go out to find a dragon, then a bunch of other stuff happens until there's another dragon. I watched the DVD a second time and programmed it to skip all the boring chapters. It turned into a twenty-five minute movie about fighting dragons, and I liked it that way. The other way was too dull to hold my attention, and my attention is easily held with a good story, no matter what the effects are like, and the effects were good, but not good enough to make up for what's missing.

How bout some eerie flasbacks that surrealistically SHOW THIS staggering 'historical event,' instead of just mentioning it in passing.  Then, the fierce battles where mankind gets his fat-ass butt kicked in, while people flee in panic and mayhem from this mythical menace that has now graduated to full reality. Also, the humiliation of modern, complacent civilization being annhiliated by legendary, mythical creatures of old folklore.  Now, THAT would be very satisfying to behold.  (H.G. Welles's 'War of the Worlds' had that disturbing underlying theme of complacency being effectively castrated by the superior alien menace).Finally, that ironic closing scene where the fleeing survivors find that old medieval castle that will now be their fortress/home - comparable to Heston finding the Statue of Liberty at the memorably haunting fade-out to the original 'Planet of the Apes'.Essentially, all quips aside, this is the dragon epic that should have been made, instead of this boring direct-to-cable mess that only had fleeting moments of action.'Nuff said.

How can one dragon hibernate for millions of years underground, undisturbed and undiscovered the entire time? Why make a point of saying the dragons eat only ash if we see them gobbling up supporting characters and other dragons? What nutritional qualities could ash contain, anyway? With most of the world's citizens cowering in shelter, how does everyone the gasoline for their vehicles? How can a dragon in freefall to earth for thousands of feet emit fire from its mouth and not incinerate itself? What was the exact reasoning behind the skydiving sequence? If there's only one male dragon, what does he do, continuously fly around the globe fertilizing eggs the world over, across oceans and everything, without stopping? What became of the million female dragons when the male was killed? And with the world in chaos, how did McC find such a skilled tattoo artist and a sharp enough blade to keep his head so smooth?It would also have been beneficial for the movie to have shown the rise of the creatures.

I had never seen a good dragon movie before - it seems dragon movies are either maudlin and sentimental, or just silly. Unfortunately after seeing Reign of Fire, I still haven't seen a good dragon film.There are numerous problems with the movie, the first of which is the strange decision to skip the destruction of the major cities and instead zoom forward to the future. The curious lack of dragons is probably the biggest problem with the film. We see a poorly-edited and truncated dragon attack in the beginning, then are forced to endure a long stretch with rebels huddling in a dank castle. The dragon attacks throughout the rest of the movie are mostly unsatisfying, as they generally involve one dragon against a few defenseless humans.Also disturbing is the inability of the dragons to stick to their preordained behavior. We are told repeatedly that they eat ash, yet several scenes involve them chomping live human beings, or at one point eating each other raw. And at one point the humans flee, saying They don't care about us ... they just want the ash from the field. So why don't the dragons attack the field?We are never told how the dragons know when people are out and about. They just magically appear when they need to. For people who have survived as long against the dragons, the humans in the castle are also poorly equipped and show total disregard for safety. After killing one dragon they fire up gigantic spotlights and blast them across the sky; candles blaze in every window. Their early warning system consists of a bird and a spyglass.Not that they do much better when Van Zan shows up. The entire Van Zan plotline is poorly thought out from the beginning - how this person and his troops managed to survive in the open countryside for so long, how they found ammunition and fuel ... so many questions left unanswered. In the only scene of the group traveling they are attacked, quite sensibly, by a dragon and their ranks utterly destroyed. This never happened before?Then it is revealed how they attack the dragons - the ludicrous idea of skydiving and attempting to snare them in a net. In the one attempt they lose two men. One burns in (apparently they have no AADs on their chutes, and no altimeter) and the other gets chomped. The skydiving itself is pretty ludicrous - I have 32 freefalls and have never seen 15000 feet of vertical cloud cover - and at one point the dragon shoots a wall of flame from his mouth, while plummeting face first. Impossible.Okay, so it is a technical misfire. It is a plotting misfire - nothing happens that is particularly compelling. And then there is the resolution, which is absolutely inane. The heroes reveal that there must be one male - one - and if they find him and kill him the race will die out. Yeah, seems sensible ... one male? The finale then becomes a poorly choreographed showdown between three people and the one male dragon. Very unsatisfying.Most confusing are the characters. McConaughey plays Van Zan as a cigar-chomping, wild-eyed Texas lunatic, spouting nonsense like Eden isn't burning, it's burnt! Bale is mostly whiny, and Izabella Scorupco doesn't really register. They fail to work as a unit; the rest are mostly redshirts waiting to get burned in anonymous action sequences.This was definitely a disappointment. Due to its poor box office returns I doubt they will make another, but it would be much cooler to see the destruction of cities, and actual battle with the dragons, than this low-rent rebel camp nonsense.

Now I have said that we can talk about other things. The story to begin with. Young boy Quinn discovers a dragon in a shaft in London. The dragons take over the world and humans destroy the world with nuclear weapons trying to kill the dragons. We go to the year 2020. Quinn (now played by Christian Bale) is not so young anymore. He is the leader of a group of survivors. They try not to give the dragons any food (themselves) so they will starve to death. Then Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) arrives with his group. Where Quinn is more of a talker Van Zan is the one who likes action, he is a dragon slayer. They do that with a helicopter, a very rare thing now. The pilot is Alex (Izabella Scorupco, Natalya from 'GoldenEye'). They have discovered that there is only one male who is fertilizing all the eggs produced by the females. This is the biggest flaw I guess but I wasn't going to say anything... So, the male must be killed. Basically this is the plot and all the sub-plots are clichés (differences between Quinn and Van Zan, the people that have to die in this kind of movie, and so on).So is there nothing good about this movie? Sure there is. I actually enjoyed all those clichés. I did that because the dragons look great, London in 2020 looks great, the acting is pretty good (McConaughey is a little annoying), the action is nice enough to be entertained and it is something I have not seen very often.

Yawwwwnnnnn.....  'Reign of Fire' will never live up to some peoples expectations, but who the hell cares?Back to the dragons.... Sorry if there's only two (I actually think there's more), but the main story is about survival of the fittest and not necessarily how many dragons can fill the screen.  The acting is hammy for the most part, but again I haven't seen a post-apocalyptic film with anything else (sorry Mad Max.. of which I'm a big fan).  So, the Americans roll in to save the day (kind of brings back memories of WWII) and some very cheeseball machismo pours off Matthew M. like melted butter on a stack of nice, American pancakes, it all adds to the experience.  What else would you expect?  (Refer to the last line of the 2nd paragraph).  I thought all in all it was a good film for the genre, par for the acting and some excellent special effects, so unlike some others out there who think a good film is one that has subtitles, click the 'subtitle' button on your DVD remote and choose either French, Spanish or Portugese and watch it that way if it will make it more enjoyable.

Compared to other films of this type, it ranks somewhere between the Road Warrior/Mad Max series and The Postman. The story begins with a young Quinn discovering a hidden cave in a newly-renovated section of the London Underground - then stumbling upon a fire-breathing dragon which has been trapped there for eons. Unfortunately, no explanation is given as to the origins of the dragon but suffice to say that the dragon emerges from his slumber, kills Quinn's mother (a wasted cameo appearance by Alice Krige), then begins to terrorize the world. Skipping the worldwide destruction which ensues, the film next jumps 12 years in the future and shows a grown-up Quinn (played capably by Christian Bale) leading a rag-tag group of survivors who live in relative peace in northern England. The dragons, however, have multiplied a thousand-fold, and now dominate the earth. At this point, Matthew McConaughey enters as the robust leader of a group of American dragon-slayers. Again, it is best not to think too hard about how a group of Americans ended up in England in such a chaotic world - although it would have been interesting to actually see how they did it, based upon their explanation of it in the film. In any case, from this point forward, the film's action really picks up and, at times, is very compelling. In retrospect, I wish the point of view for the entire film had been from the perspective of the Van Zan character (McConaughey), as he actually tends to steal the movie away from the Quinn character. Rob Bowman's direction of `Reign of Fire is well done, really, considering that he began as a regular director of several X-Files episodes, as well as the X-Files movie. In fact, the entire film has a certain dark eerieness about it which looks not unlike an extended episode of that now-defunct series. The effects are well done, too, although too limited in their scope. We see the flying dragons from time to time, and they do look convincing. What is missing, however, is the context of how destructive the dragons are. We see only the results of their destruction in brief, panoramic CGI views of a destroyed London - nothing more. If only this film had had a bigger budget, we could have seen more backstory about the dragons, but alas, this is missing. Obviously, viewers should NOT go into Reign of Fire looking for an Oscar winner - and WITH a healthy dose of suspension-of-disbelief - but given those parameters, it can be quite entertaining.

And if you miss the dragon? Well... err... I guess you're screwed and at least you died like a man! The American Way!And then there was something about jumping on a motorbike and driving very fast so you can lure the dragon into the path of someone with a homemade harpoon to kill the dragon instantly.

Anyone who remembers 'Dr Who' and the Daleks roaming around London will get a good idea of what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, there hasn't exactly been an overabundance of post-apocalypse-Britain films in the last decade or so. Then, like the proverbial buses, two come along at once. Last year saw the arrival of the excellent '28 Days Later.', a film which featured stunning shots of a deserted London, some genuine scares, and a decent (if unoriginal) B-movie zombie style plot. 2002 also saw the arrival of 'Reign of Fire', a film which, like '28 Days', features stunning shots of a deserted London. but, sadly, not much else. Dragons this time, not zombies, or even Daleks, although inclusion of either of the last two elements might have made the film at least watchable.Right from the start it is embarrassingly clear that very little thought went into this film. First we've got to endure the dodgy Australo-Cockney accents in the lame prologue which sets up the denouement in a way that is so ridiculously obvious you think 'they can't have given away the ending already!' Oh, but they have! Now you've just got to sit through the next hour and a half of meaningless drivel before we get to see the predictable finale. For those who still aren't convinced of this film's lack of worth, what follows will hopefully make it abundantly clear.Rather than let the audience work out for themselves that the release of the dragons in the prologue caused the inevitable downfall of civilisation as we know it, we are 'shown' what happened through the ultra-cliched device of news clips and tattered newspapers. Don't worry about overstretching your brains too much in trying to work out the plot or complex relations between the characters either. There's none of that here. However, just in case you think I'm being unduly harsh and critical, the film's not all bad (well, not quite).The main chunk of the film is set in a 'Mad Max'-style hideout in the Northumberland countryside. There a band of survivors, led by Quinn (played adequately by Christian Bale) eke out a meagre living while trying to dodge dragons in an impressive, ash-blasted landscape. The colour-drained nature of these scenes is particularly striking, and the set is suitably post-apocalyptic/medieval in design. There are some nice touches, like Quinn and his Scottish buddy Creedy (don't worry about having to tax any brain cells discerning the complex nature of the relationship between these two - Creedy makes it quite clear when he says `I'm your best friend' at the start of the film) performing part of the 'Empire Strikes Back' as a play for the kids in the camp. After a minor dragon attack (complete with eye-catching CGI dragon) the Americans arrive (in tanks, natch) led by the fearsome Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey). McConaughey looks unusually buff, what with his shaved head, rippling biceps, and wiry beard. However, he plays possibly the most distressingly bad character in the film. I can only guess that the director wanted Van Zan to be 'on the verge of madness'. What we get is McConaughey overacting badly staring wild-eyed, running around grunting, and calling Quinn's band of survivors `pitiful'. Still, he effortlessly manages to steal practically every single scene since many of the other characters are pathetically two-dimensional.Van Zan's arrival is presumably supposed to underline the tensions in Quinn's nice little survivor commune. Unfortunately, most of the characters are so weak and undeveloped at this point that I cared little for this aspect of the film. In fact, with hindsight it seems more likely that the director was just itching to get into a bit of dragon killing action. Here are the Americans! They'll show us how it's done! What follows is one of the most unbelievably contrived action sequences I have ever seen. In order to 'catch the dragon' Van Zan's flunkies must apparently use a helicopter, three guys on motorbikes, three guys in the helicopter who skydive OUT of the helicopter and fly around at 500 mph trying to `get a lock' and fire a net at the dragon, and Van Zan himself who sits around barking orders at everyone and fires a big harpoon. Lines like `he's on my tail' and `lock and load' are thrown around without a second thought. Why they even bothered with all of this guff is never explained, especially when, at the end of the film, it is revealed that a simple crossbow and an exploding bolt can bring down the uber-dragon himself.These dragon-killing antics impress the rest of the survivors so much that most of them agree to leave their families and follow the charismatic Van Zan down the road to London to kill the male uber-dragon who fertilises the female dragons' eggs. Just in case we haven't quite grasped this utterly banal plot device, the script-writers make it spirit-crushingly clear - kill the male dragon and there're no more dragons left! Ohhhh, right, I get it.With the rest of the film more or less mapped out, it proceeds from point A to point B with little to no excitement to plug the gap. There's an unbearably feeble sub-plot featuring Quinn's 'son' Jared (some downright awful acting by Scott James Moutter), and a barely-hinted-at love interest for Quinn in the form of Alex (Izabella Scorupco) - one of Van Zan's crew. As a (very) mindless action-flick I suppose this film passes the time. But why bother when the same elements have been done better a thousand times before in films like 'Predator', 'Alien(s)', 'Pitch Black', or the aforementioned '28 Days Later.'. If there are any sparks of excitement and originality to be found in this film, there certainly isn't enough to start a fire. "}{"Title":"Bad chemistry, horrible timeline confusions.

Christain Bail in contrary does put a great performance down, but is in my opinion due to the fact that his character is more believable than Matthews one.**/***** "},{"Title":"Absolute Rubbish","Date":"9 September 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" I can't believe that I wasted my time watching this.

More pickpocket than movie, this flick is the Holy Grail of false advertising.Well, to be fair, there are a couple of dragons - in extreme long shot for a few frames at a time - but put end-to-end, their total footage is barely two minutes.

So what do we see? A lot of cranked-up shots of clouds. Dragon attacks castle! So what do we see? A couple of brief long shots before cutting to people running around in cellars while the hero rides back just in time to see it leaving. Are you detecting a pattern here?Instead, we get a non-script with a great back story (which, as is noted repeatedly here, would have made a much better film and has some pretty decent ideas in it) shot in a grotty disinterested fashion by a director who really doesn't seem to want to make a dragon movie at all. And as for the action scenes - what action scenes? Where the money went is anybody's guess, because it sure ain't on the screen rarely has anyone spent so much money making a movie look so cheap. And what's with the sound mix? Between the cast's mumbling and the 'atmospherics,' half the dialogue was almost completely inaudible.This could have been one of the coolest dragon flicks ever, but Bowman and co have ruined it for anyone else in the business with this dull, lifeless fire extinguisher of a movie. Still, maybe it's my own fault for ignoring the fact that Gerard Butler was in it - his presence in a movie is as much a guarantee of a stinker as Virginia Madsen's was in the 80s.See 'Dragonslayer' or even 'Dragonheart' instead - dragon movies which actually have dragons in them.

It's basically false advertising.The posters feature London in flames, Big Ben blazing, an apache helicopter in aerial combat with a dragon. Wow! Did this EVER happen at any point in the film? NO! What we do get however is 90 minutes of dirty peasants standing about in a quarry and 10 minutes of very unremarkable dragons huffing and puffing. The idea of them ruling the world is completely lost as we never see anything other than a dirty quarry.The trailer said that the movies takes place in 2084 but it doesn't it begins in 2010 (for no particular reason) when a young Christian Bale (a great actor who is repeatedly contracting himself to bad movies) hangs about at his mother's work (drilling for a new underground tunnel for London's tube trains). He comes across some kind of weird egg in a long, long forgotten cave. This, somehow, reawakens a sleeping dragon (which must be female if it has laid this egg) which promptly kills some of the diggers and escapes. Right at this moment the movie jumps to several years later!What a rip off! The entire story of the Dragons taking over the world is just skipped. Why? They threw all of that away! Then they expect us to accept a story in which tough American soldier Van Zant (Matthew McConaughey) travels all the way across the Atlantic with his team to wipe out the Granddaddy of all dragons, who is located in London. But Van Zant travels there via a Northumberland quarry. Makes sense. He says that he would have brought a bigger team but lost most of them over the ocean. Why would dragons be out on the ocean? Fishing? Swimming? I hope they didn't expect us to imagine that they were on some kind of reconnaissance mission.So, anyway, Van Zant believes that this big dragon is the only male and killing it will lead to the extinction of the speices. This means that female dragons can only lay female eggs. So where did this male come from if the Dragon at the start was female? Even a throwaway line of pure exposition would have covered over this gaping error.And how does all the 3D imaging technology and tanks and helicopters Van Zant brings with him work? It would have broke in that space of time. And how did they transport a tank over the Atlantic exactly? And how could his team have lasted so long when they are clearly idiots and get killed right away?All good questions.

The proceedings are meant to be so fast, so rushed, so furious, so surprising, so full of twists that essential elements of narrative fall to the wayside at every turn, never to be fully recovered. I watched this under the best conditions, on a widescreen TV with DTS sound and with the subtitles on for good measure. But because every bit of exposition is set during action, movement or panic conditions, very little of the storyline was understandable. About an hour into the film I had about a hundred questions to ask the scriptwriters and this DVD doesn't come with a commentary track so I pretty much made up my own story to pass the time. Action movie rule of thumb number one whenever vital bits of exposition are shouted under the noise of an incoming helicopter (a.k.a. the James Cameron syndrome), the viewer should know he's in for a rough ride. This rule also holds for incoming fire-breathing dragons. Action movie rule of thumb number two always turn the subtitles on. In the case of this little masterpiece of elliptic storytelling, you actually get extra informative dialog that didn't make it to the final soundtrack and that was probably chopped off to make the characters sound even more macho, enigmatic and virile, as if that was at all possible. With subtitles, the poor viewer actually stands an even chance of catching some of the characters' names before they leave or fry to a crisp. The bleakness of the photography, lighting and sets and the permanent wearing of soot, beards and oily black rags make any attempt at positively identifying the living in this story extremely chancy. Among the questions you will most frequently ask yourself during this film, besides the one most commonly heard in today's movie houses (i.e. `Who are those people?'), are Who or what am I looking at (at any given moment)? Do any of these people have any feeling for one another? Do any of these people have any feelings at all? Where do the Americans get their weapons, vehicles and ammunition, but mostly the fuel for their engines? Why did they leave America? How did they get here? What do they live on? Why do they want to go to London? What stops them? Why do they and the dragon come back to the castle? Why is the action set in 2020 when the theatrical trailer mentions 2086?  Why does anyone in this film do anything at all? I would also pay a handsome premium to learn what the `angels' are actually trying to accomplish by plunging to their death from such heights? Of course, exactly what barbed creature has crawled up Matthew McConaughy's rectum remains an open subject for debate all through this film and a challenging brain-teaser for all serious students of modern narrative and acting techniques.

Then Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) and his soldiers show up with some tanks, a helicopter, and a plan to kill off the dragons.

The visual effects creating the dragons themselves are wonderful, but the plot is dismal. There is a rather boring bit of local bickering among British survivors, then a brief power struggle between their leader and the leader of the American arrivals, then a few brief sequences of battles with the dragons. And there is a lot of footage of bits of scenery burning, and of blackened, burnt-out landscape and cityscape. As others have said, although it pretends to be set in our own non-magical world, with the dragons part of a normal palaeontology that takes in the known dinosaurs, the scientific basis for the dragons' physiology is dubious to the point of nonsensical. The present day scene at the beginning, with the rediscovery and awakening of the first dragon, introduces the protagonist's mother apparently only to kill her off as a motivation for his survival and becoming leader of the British group; however the fact that he was there as a boy is never used in the rest of the story except for a brief flashback memory in a stressful moment later on. The entire premise of the screenplay, that the powers that be and all the armed forces of nations at the beginning of the 21st century would be so helpless against the creatures for 20 years, so that most of the human race is wiped out, but that these same monsters could then finally be defeated by a handful of people with a few hand-held weapons including a sort of harpoon gun about a metre or two long, is utterly preposterous. For me, the story fell quite flat throughout. A major disappointment and a total waste of the acting skills of the cast and the labours of the visual effects artists and animators who created the truly beautiful and terrifying-looking flying beasts themselves.

Unfortunately, this film failed to live up to my expectations, and i was appalled by the extremely poor quality.Evidently, they've tried portray the survivors in that way- done so well in madmax2- run down, isolated and distant from a reality which they once knew... however, they came across as annoying hobos with really crap weapons...... i couldn't stand that annoying 'conflict' of characters on the same 'team', so often badly conveyed i.e. 'Oh, u cant be serious, this will never work!' or 'I believe in u, we can do it'...... arggghhh, annoying! All the characters lack depth and originality. At one point i thought... 'Yes! Here comes the cavalry (Americans) with fun weapons that might actually hurt the big lizards'..... but this cavalry failed to make the film anymore interesting or exciting.... they attempted to portray the main American character as a crazy, un-couth and courageous warrior... but he was really annoying and made the film even more unbearable.... the climax of the film was the American guy leaping at a dragon and getting messed up.... the one scene that could have made me say 'Ahh, that was pretty cool' failed to do so.

With that premise, you imagine modern armies fighting dragons, cities being destroyed and great human drama. Unfortunately, the resulting movie out of that premise is one of the most horrible pieces of trash I've seen in a long time. The biggest problem is the 2 million plot holes that cannot be filled by any amount of dragons.  Sci-fi and fastastic stories do require suspension of disbelief.  Fine with that.  But, this movie requires that turn your brain off completely or that your age does not exceed that of a 4 year-old. Having chosen the time for the action sometime after the dragons have obliterated civilization puts the movie in Mad Max and Waterworld territory and we have been there before, several times.  And please, are we supposed to endure several additional sequels just to patch the holes of the original movie?  Its sad when the best scene in a movie is an unlicensed re-enactment of the Darth Vader battle in Empire of the Jedi. The second problem is the director.  After the X-files movie, this guy is still given another chance?  Why?  Oh why?  All action sequences are low on suspense, there's not much direction of actors, and the photography and lighting is unispired.  Even worse, some battles are simply badly edited and it is hard to believe the actors and dragon are in the same location. Matthew McConaughey steals all his scenes as the tough army man and seems to have gone out of his way to pump his physique.  His role is cliche as they come, but he pulls it off.  Christian Bale, once again given a starring role, blows it, delivering okay acting but far from the much needed hero in conflict that the movie asked for.  His character arc and motivation seem to much telegraphed and let's face it, this is a role that requires charm. Bale does not have that.  He ain't Mel Gibson. The beautiful Izabella Scorupco comes out decently, as both tough girl and subtly implied love interest. And then there's the dragons... After Draco, it is hard to create a more realistic CGI dragon.  And the movie does not break any new ground.  The dragon here is a monster and performs as such with good animation, but its integration is many times unbeliavable.  Even worse are the depictions of dragons and mayhem seen thru photographs and newspapers.   In terms of effects, the fire pyrothecnics are indeed the main attraction.

Let me say that I would have been extremely dissapointed had I payed a cent to see it.Frankly, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The writing is on the same level as waterworld, and other than the basic premise, it brings very little that is new or interesting to the genre.I was surprised that Matthew McConaughey was willing to touch this project. If you manage to last to the end there is a particular scene towards the end of the picture which is shot in slow motion (I won't say more) which drives home how cheesy this movie really is.Avoid it at all costs  "},{"Title":"Horrible","Date":"8 July 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Do yourself a favor and save the money.  This hackneyed script could have been penned by a 5 year old.  If you actually enjoy this movie you are a masochist.  In theory, a movie set in a Post-apocalyptic world inhabited by dragons sounds quite nifty but it really isn't.  Once five minutes have elapsed in the theater you'll wish you had heeded this warning.

The story is as thin as they come - penned by an eight-year-old perhaps - with little point or message.  As a fantasy, it has the depth and quality of a junior high school droop out's first attempt at crafting a D&D scenario - so don't even give me that loosen up, it's just for fun crap.  Fun would be something 1/10th as good as The Princess Bride, this was 1/10th as good as a below average A-Team episode without Mr.T.  While drizzled hear and there with some low-grade bits of meaningless action, most of the movie consists of people talking to each other in front of poorly lit sets.  What action there is mostly consists of quick flashes of cheap digital violence, in which meaningless characters disappear from the story in no particular order.  The viewer is repeatedly asked to excuse the most idiotic plot points imaginable, with little if any payoff for doing so.  Numerous unfinished details dangle helplessly from the story's unfinished edges, included I suppose only because the effects just looked too cool, dude to toss the scenes completely.  It is clear that the creators of this mess had better intentions than what they ended up with, but there is no debating the fact that much of what we see on screen (and wait through, bored in our seats) is bare-bones filler intended only to fill out the minimal length of a feature.  Reign of Fire is totally disappointing, stay away.

The movie has no real plot, it has no logic it all, bad acting (Scorupo being worst), even the special effects are not really worth mentioning, if they were, this wouldn't help, either. More than 20 years after Mad Max another rip-off (sort of), but one of the worst kind. It's just amazing to see with which great fanfare such movies are being promoted and - even more surprisingly - being regarded in a positive way by the audience. Unfortunately, actors in Hollywood have to do some of these movies to stay in business, because after having played in such a movie, I wouldn't offer any one of them a role anymore, personally.

This sucks - in a very modern, stylised Hollywood way.Avoid at all costs. Daytime talk shows have more content than this. Snail races have more suspense. How Christian Bale ended up in this is beyond me.

It started off pretty good but it didn't go that well for long. The beginning felt like 7/10 for me and in the middle somewhere 5/10 and than I just couldn't bare watching it anymore. They did it all wrong, even acting. The music was strange too. The plot was completely strange and not really perfected there were too many question marks left like why so suddenly were the dragons back or how come no one organized there killing properly I mean it's in the future there has to be some kind of nuclear weapons or gas or something and that simply made it unrealistic to me. They overused this blue/gray filter or what it was it was just annoying and made the mediocre SFX even look worse. And the characters were just not believable, they acted like this than like some times I thought those multiple persons in one.. I don't know it didn't feel real. Just don't watch it though it may look interesting... it's not.

It isn't the absolute worst film I've seen for a while, but it certainly isn't good enough to see again. Anyway, basically years ago miners opened up a long buried dragon, and as the years pass, Earth has become an incinerated wasteland with who ever's left alive doing everything they can to survive, and find a way to kill the fire breathing beasts. Leader of a Northumberland medieval castle is Quinn Abercromby (American Psycho's Christian Bale), and his whole group of survivors, including friend Creedy (300's Gerard Butler), are hoping the dragons will die out and go into hibernation, but their running out of food. One day, American dragon slayers arrive, led by Denton Van Zan (EdTV's Matthew McConaughey), with pilot Alex Jensen (GoldenEye's Izabella Scorupco), and they are all now working together to bring down the beasts. That's about it! Also starring Scott James Moutter as Jared Wilke, David Kennedy as Eddie Stax, Alexander Siddig as Ajay, Ned Dennehy as Barlow, Rory Keenan as Devon, Terence Maynard as Gideon and Alice Krige as Karen Abercromby. The special effects are worth looking at, but the performances are all woody (not just from McConaughy), the story is lame, well, it's just a lame film. Adequate! "}]
