Dave has a beautiful new young girlfriend named Kim (Maria Pitillo) but still sports a wandering eye. Vic, whose soul was definitely bruised by his ex-wife, is just agreeing to go on a blind date with Lucille (Janeane Garofalo). As for Donny (Paul Reiser), he is also having severe trouble moving on, holding his former wife in high esteem, even though she has remarried. All of the men have children that they love deeply and who fall into their custody at the appropriate times. Yet, meeting their former mates at such places as McDonald's, in order to exchange their children, still gives everyone a pang of hurt. Will Dave learn to commit himself to one woman? Will Vic let go of his resentments and take a chance on a new love? And will Donny realize his ex is never coming back and give himself permission to love someone else, even if it is Dave's former wife (Amy Brenneman)? As for the kids, will they be able to weather their parents divorce, too? This is a truthful and touching film about divorce in modern America. Yes, it is very common now, making life complicated, especially when children are involved. But, even so, it is not the end of the world, as all of the men, women, and kids discover in this movie. All of the actors are wonderful, with Quaid, especially, giving an extremely humorous and thoughtful performance. Special mention should also go to Garofalo for her drop-dead-funny, neurotic-yet-lovable portrayal of a divorc√©e. Then, too, the California setting is lovely, the costumes very well chosen, and the production values quite high. Most of all, the script is funny, original, and brutally honest. If you have been down the divorce highway, you should definitely make time for this film. It will help heal wounds with its laughs and sensitivity. But, even if you just want to find a film that will let you yuck it up, this one is a terrific choice.

Of all the movies I've seen dealing with divorce and broken homes this one comes the closest to portraying what it was like (at least for me and my family). Best of all, it's not a depressing downer of a movie. It's fun to watch and emotional at the same time. The most effective part of the film for me was the relationship between Paul Reiser and his daughter since it reminded me so much of my dad and sister. All of the actors are extremely well chosen (minus the very bland Mathew Modine). It handles the topic of divorce responsibly and doesn't load on the melodramatics.

People often associate comedy with filmssuch as Airplane!, or Hot Shots, but anybody looking for thiskind of humour is going to be a little disappointed. Bye Bye Lovesimply tries to bring the subject of divorce, with all the benefits andthe costs it can have, in a comical fashion, admittedly, but it doesnot let the production be ruled by laughs and gags. In fact, it isdoused with only a sprinkling of laughs, particularly in the middleof the film itself.The film itself is also incredibly effective at relaying the message itbrings, and leaves the audience with some doubt as to whetherdivorce is the answer to an unhappy relationship - but it alsoenforces that it is not the end of the world.When the jokes do come in, to relieve some of the tension in thefilm, they are usually quick and simple, and all the cast deliver withskill. The real star of the show, however, has got to be RandyQuaid (Vic), who plays a spectacular performance and brings outthe best comical content in his scenes, particularly those involvinghis wife's porch, his date (played by Janeane Garofalo, a good foilagainst Quaid) and his reactions to Dr. David Townsend (playedsuperbly by Rob Reiner).In all, the film tackles some important issues about married lifeand the problems that can happen, without ever taking itself tooseriously, and in the end, it's hard to say how the film might haveimproved itself.

The three men at the center of the story, Vic, Donny, and Dave, have recently been divorced. It appears that all three have gone through friendly separations, as in all three cases, children are involved. Since the kids are under the mother's custody, the fathers have the right to get them for week-end visits.All three friends seem somewhat adjusted to their new realities. Vic, looks as the most grounded man of the trio. Donny, is the saddest case, and Dave, who is a wishy washy man, is trying his hand at a new relationship with a much younger woman. The wives, on the other hand, have moved on with their lives. The three women appear to have no problems with their new status.The exchange of children occurs in a suburban McDonald's, a neutral territory. This is a type of brand placing that Hollywood films love to show. Fast food, alas, stands for an allegory of what's missing with most marriages these days when most families don't even share a meal together. There is also the talk radio personality who is in the air taking calls from divorced people and advising them what to do, yet, he doesn't even have a clue about what he is talking about; after all, he's been married five times! The acting is adequate. The best thing in the film is Randy Quaid, who as Vic, makes the most of his role. Janeane Garofalo appears as a date from hell, in a funny sequence. The ensemble cast does fine work under Sam Weisman's direction.The sad fact of this story is that all these children, we see in the film, will probably go through divorces in their own lives.

The ex-wives are correctly shown I feel of how women in America have the upper hand in divorce, as them being first, kids second ex husbands last. Aside from that this film sucks.

Matthew Modine plays an always smiling (never acting) charmer.  Randy Quaid plays another odd character that never is well developed because the movie has too many plots and characters to really focus on anyone in particular.One thing that sickens me about this movie is how much blatant advertising is done within it.  Off the top of my head, I remember Kettle Chips, Minute Maid, and last and certainly not least, McDonald's.  I bet MickeyD's patroned the entire movie, to show that divorcees should meet there every weekend to trade their kids, seeing as the divorce rate in America is over 50% of all married couples.  What a demographic to hit for!  I never heard of people meeting at fast food restaurants to exchange their kids for the weekend before this.Next thing, Eliza Dushku hitting on the guy who works at McDonalds?  How realistic is that?  Yes, I realize all of you Buffy fans that she is Faith but it doesn't make up for the fact that her character was undeveloped and weak.  For example, when she gets drunk and screams at her father and says all of that typical i broke up the marriage crap... where did any of that come from?   We are given no clues as to why she's angry except for Reiser's that age between 13 and 36 quote.The chronology in this movie was hard to follow, too, because most of the scenes played independent to the others, while going back and forth between the 40 stories going on.  The music montages added to the story, making it even worse than it already was.  The lovely wrap-up at the end really made the story feel like it ended at a very awkward place.  The climax was very... semi-climatic.  Quaid's character is a rollercoaster of uncertainty. He's not a dynamic character... he's a schiz.  So is his lovely date, Garafolo.This movie doesn't give insight as to what men are going through after a divorce... it gives what women want men to be like.

Told primarily through the perspective of three divorced fathers, it offers an overview of what has increasingly become a significant segment of family life in America.  Donny (Paul Reiser) hasn't yet accepted that it's over between himself and his ex, Claire (Jayne Brook); he still feels too much for her.  He tells his friends he'll start dating again when it feels right (It's been three years).  At the same time, he's having trouble communicating with his fourteen -year-old daughter, Emma (Eliza Dushku), who, according to Donny, is in `That difficult age group  twelve through thirty-five.'  Dave (Matthew Modine) has a fairly amicable relationship with his ex, Susan (Amy Brenneman), but still shies away from commitment, and has a string of girlfriends.  At one point his son, Ben (Ross Malinger), asks if they could wear name tags to make it easier on him.  Vic (Randy Quaid) has the hardest time of all; he and his ex, Grace (Lindsay Crouse) are barely civil to one another, which, of course, makes handling the situation with the kids all the more difficult. 	The film does a nice job of addressing the various dilemmas faced by all involved, including the children, without ever delving too deeply or getting so serious as to take the story in an entirely different direction; from the Friday transfers of the kids from mom to dad, to the attempts at weekend `bonding' with their children by the fathers who desperately want to stay close, to the needs of all the adults to find the love and relationships necessary to move on with their lives.  There's some memorable moments, as well, here; one is a thoughtful sequence played against Mary Chapin Carpenter's wistful song `Stones In The Road,' and another is an especially hilarious scene in which Vic has a blind date with a young divorcee named Lucille (Janeane Garofalo), which starts off badly and goes downhill from there.  Their dinner together at an Italian restaurant is priceless; pure classic comedy.  Another nice touch to the overall story is using a young man, Max (Johnny Whitworth), who works at McDonald's and is training Walter (Ed Flanders), a seventy-year-old working on the `adopt a geezer' program, as a kind of before and after contrast to where Donny, Vic and Dave are currently at in their own lives.  Max is just entering the arena of romance; he has an eye for Vic's daughter, Meg (Amber Benson), while Walter is a widower who lost his wife after forty-eight years of marriage, and still pines for her.  Interjected throughout is another nice bit, as radio talk-show-host-marriage-counselor Dr. David Townsend (Rob Reiner) of station KGAB dispenses advice even as he prepares for his own fifth wedding. 	The supporting cast includes Maria Pitillo (Kim), Dana Wheeler-Nicholson (Heidi) and Pamela Dillman (Sheila).  The performances are good all around, most notably Reiser, who conveys his angst and frustration particularly well, and Quaid, whose bitterness and caustic sarcasm are almost tangible.  The real standout here, however, is Garofalo, who takes hold of a lesser role and absolutely shines, creating a singularly unforgettabe character in Lucille.  This may not be a masterpiece, but it's a good movie, and one you're going to want to see more than once (or even twice).  Anyone who has ever been married, divorced, a parent, a kid or any of the above, will find something here with which to identify.  `Bye Bye, Love,' is sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet and touching, and one you're going to remember and, I think,  appreciate.   I rate this one 8/10.

Although, there¬¥s some funny situations in Bye, bye..., the entire film is gross and dizzy; there¬¥s not much reality in plot   and characters. Just a deep male self piety, sick and fool. Men are victims again, but are not valiant enough to love each other, the reason are children.

If you rent it fast forward to her part and then turn it off because it is not a good movie.  There is one other funny bit with Paul Reiser but other than the movie is terrible. Not suprisingly it has Mathew Modine in it who for someone reason keeps turning up in movies.  I figured Ethan Hawke would suck up all his roles since the two are almost indistinguishable or however you spell that word. So if you are huge fan of Janeane like I am then watch for her small but very funny role and then keep watching at your own risk just remember that you were warned.

Plus, I find Paul Reiser funny for some reason. When I started playing this movie, a weird feeling hit me, and it never left me after that point. It was a feeling of dread, perhaps. Bye Bye Love is trite. It's hard for me to call a movie trite because I find myself being one-note on occasion. The movie was a long string of inconsequential one-liners punctuated by stressed emotional moments. I really liked Janeane Garofalo here, as a crazy blind date for Randy Quaid, who was the most genuine of the three father-actors(Matthew Modine, Reiser, and Quaid). The B-plot of the movie seemed to shift focus between Rob Reiner's lousy radio psychiatrist and Ed Flanders as an old man trying to find use for himself as a McDonald's employee(in his last role, wasted on this movie). Reiner provides the psych evaluation of divorc√©es, and the segue into the weekend ritual of swapping kids(at the corporate sponsor of the movie, McDonald's, whose ominous flags and arches loom in the background of too many of the exterior shots), and gets his comeuppance at the end of the movie, at the hands of Quaid. This seems like a good John Hughes movie gone terribly, terribly wrong, complete with silly montages and the expository scene at the end where everybody has a revelation and warm feelings. I think someone was trying to package this movie as a The Big Chill 'the next step,' with the requisite soundtrack(including much Everly Brothers, hence the name of the movie). One thing that creeped me out about this movie was the presence of both Amber Benson and Lindsay Crouse, and Dushku, who all worked together again in the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Danny Masterson was also present, as the stereotypical stoner/drunk kid, and in blink-and-you'll-miss-them roles were Jack Black as a party DJ and Steven Root as a disgruntled neighbor.

While many films have been done to death about divorced families and the trials and tribulations of their ex-spouses and kids, Bye Bye Love creates a very realistic chemistry of bickering couples, couples who still love each other, and single dads who have trouble dealing with divorce in multi-dimensional ways.It's all there The day planning, the little league games, the dates, where everything that can go wrong often does go wrong. Mix all of this with the loud kids and spouses! Many people can deal with these issues in their own dysfunctional families. Watch for the best scene in the movie, where one of the Dad's has a Date from Hell at an Italian restaurant! Some critics and reviews have negatively discussed how the film personifies McDonald's as an ad endorsement for the fast-food chain. But, I didn't see this at all. Many people of divorced families will often meet at a fast food place for lunch or dinner to talk about their issues with their spouses and kids. Another element to the realism of the movie.The only minor downfall is that the ending is a little too pat and preachy with the Just love your kids routine. But there are many strong subplots and situations that anyone going through a divorce can understand. I recommend this movie. You might find something in it if you are going through a divorce, especially with kids involved, that you can relate to it in your own life. I always made a point to watch Bye Bye Love whenever it is on. Now I can watch the movie anytime I want. I own the DVD, and learn something new from the movie after each subsequent viewing.

Modine acted avg at best. Reiser seems to only be able to play one kind of role. It's so sappy I thought I was sitting under a tree while viewing. And why is the sub plot about the Mickey D's worker and the old guy even here? I guess to just make it longer. And really the only good thing about the movie is, the date part. But even with all of this against it, I don't care. I still enjoyed it. Not because it's great cinema. Not because it's even good cinema.

Before they say they enjoyed it, they have to leave a disclaimer saying that they realize it isn't a great movie, or that it's silly or stupid...but they liked it anyway. I love this movie. I'm not going to say it was dumb or silly, or corny and sappy, or anything else. The movie is great because it makes me laugh every time I watch it. It's heartwarming, it's surprisingly true to life and suburbian divorce, and it's entertaining. Not every great movie has to be The Godfather or Gone with the Wind. Some great movies are not epics. They are simply entertaining.

Credibility abounds with the cast here as no one player stands out but all support one another very well.Paul Reiser, Mathew Modine, and Randy Quaid are the father's here. How they handle life after first love is both poignant and insightful. The use of radio host, divorce specialist Dr. David Townsend(played by Rob Reiner), is a wonderful backdrop to the story.Most stories of this nature have looked at the issues from the woman's view but in our increasing desire to explore both sides experiences we have seen this issue, the divorced parent, from the male viewpoint. A good example, and a movie I'd recommend, is One Fine Day. It stars George Clooney and Michelle Pheifer and explores the issue from both the male and female sides. But OFD is a story of 2 divorced parents finding love again. Bye Bye Love shows the various ups and downs these father's go through in moving on with their lives. Performances by the supporting cast is terrific, especially Amy Brennerman and Lindsey Crouse.All in all a good feel good movie which is on cable regularly but is worth the rental to see once or the purchase if you enjoy this type movie at your disposal.

They have sons and daughters, who live with their ex-wives and share part of the time with them. This dramatic comedy intends to show, mostly in a comic way, their relationship with new mates and their former families, especially with sons and daughters. Parts of this movie are very funny and great when, for example, Donny says to Dave that his teenager daughter is in the age when girls become problematic and complicated and Dave asks `-Which age is that?' Donny responds `-From twelve to thirty-five (years old)', I really laughed a lot! But other parts do not work well and are boring, such as the dinner between Vic and Lucille (Janeane Garofalo) or mushy, such as the final dialog between Donny and his teenager daughter. Probably the fast food chain Mc Donald is sponsoring this movie, since its advertisement is a shame! Although forgettable, this film entertains. My vote is six.

Although it does the job, I personally hate such devices to bring climaxes to films.But alas, this is not Shakespearean tragedy, but more of a modern-day misfortune which is aware of its position and is more then good at the latter.
