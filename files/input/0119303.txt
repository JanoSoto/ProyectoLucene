Of course it was a better idea to do in a different direction and with John Hughes still producing and writing you know there's going to be a good amount of imagination and creativity.This time around we have 8-year-old Alex Pruitt defend his house against international criminals. Stuck at home with Chicken Pox with both his parents tied-up in work matters, Alex suspects foul play on his snowy street when he witnesses strangers poking around in his neighbor's house. Of course, no one believes an imaginative 8-year-old so he has to deal with them himself.It turns out that a toy car Alex got from the old-lady across the street is actually a Trojan horse to smuggle a priceless defence microchip to the North Korean mob. They really ought to hire better criminals as they fall for every one of Alex's sadistic booby-traps.Yes, that is basically the whole plot but it gets enough mileage out of it and it's still very funny. Set in January, it lacks the Xmas feel of the first two, but I guess that would have just been a distraction. John Williams' theme only gets a brief recital at the start, but from then on it's an adequate (if not exceptional) score from Hans Zimmer pal Nick Glennie-Smith. Despite these key differences of characters and theme, it still feels like it has enough continuity with the others.It's a totally worthwhile and enjoyable sequel that has a bad rep for no reason.

The setting is still suburban Chicago during the Christmas season, the family is still upper middle class, and even the theme music is very similar to the predecessors. This time, however, the kid is NOT abandoned by his entire family who took off for their Christmas Vacation. This time our pint sized hero is left unattended only for hours at a time, while he is at home and sick with the measles. A gang of foreign spys is after a top secret multi-million dollar computer chip stolen from the US Air Force. Of course, they hide it in a battery-operated toy that ends up with the kid. Although the boobie trap routine could be viewed as just another rip-off from the first two films, the gags seem a bit more sophisticated and less forced in 3. The mere fact that our hero is not dealing with wet bandit idiots this time around makes the whole show less of a kiddie circus. The third running is also leaving out the mushy side plots which would've gotten tiresome by now. All in all this is a fun show for the whole family. I showed this film to my 4th grade class and they gave it 20 thumbs up. Not for the grown-up comedy critic, but definitely a winner with kids.

Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style.I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie.The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who torment him. Another flaw was the actual home alone bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware.

While it's not an absolutely terrible movie, this sequel to the first two, hugely successful, films suffers from a few major problems.Problem one &#x96; no Macaulay Culkin. He may not be the best, or even cutest, kid actor in the world but Culkin was the undeniable star of the Home Alone movies and so setting up a story in which some other kid (young Alex, played by Alex D. Linz) has to stay at home on his own thanks to a case of the measles just isn't going to please those who wanted more of Culkin's antics.Problem two &#x96; no Daniel Stern or Joe Pesci. The baddies of the piece are a bunch of agents (three men and one woman) who are after a special chip that has been placed in a remote control car given to Alex by one of his neighbours. The actors all do fairly well with their roles but they're no match for the gut-busting physical comedy that Stern was able to showcase in the previous films.Problem three &#x96; it stretches believability, even for a Home Alone movie, in places and the complexity of some of the booby traps here make the kid look more like a new MacGyver than a new Macaulay.But for those not feeling overly precious about things and willing to give it a go, these problems can also be turned around and viewed as positive. At least with a different kid as the focus of the attention we don't have to try to believe that the same thing would keep happening again and again to little Kevin McCallister and Alex D. Linz is quite a likable little moppet so that also works in the film's favour.And while we're lacking The Wet/Sticky Bandits we at least get double the amount of victims trying to navigate their way through numerous, inventive booby-traps. Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny von Dohlen and David Thornton may have weaker material to work with but they still provide a good mix of menace and idiocy.The other big bonus for the movie is that, although it's inherently repetitive when compared to the concept of it's predecessors, it doesn't identically replicate moments as the second film did. This means that things feel familiar but also a little fresher this time around.The cast all do well enough and there's the lovely Haviland Morris playing Alex's mother while a very young Scarlett Johansson appears in the role of big sis, so completist fans may be interested in this for that reason alone.Director Gosnell doesn't do anything spectacular but he's far from incompetent and paces the film well while leading everyone towards that big, trap-laden finale that we all want to see. An easy film for fans of the first two to be harsh towards, this actually makes for mildly amusing family fun and I'm sure it would keep some kids happy on a dreary afternoon stuck indoors. Though it would never be a first choice.

This one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. The new score is quite bad(though the new setting traps piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. It (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it's still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). The fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that isn't the first time in the series). It's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I could follow it, but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence.

Its a common enough technique, this bit about shifting frames of reference, and he wasn't the first. Dr. Suess comes to mind with kids and naturally we have the root of science fiction.But Hughes hit a spot that was so sweet because the target frame of reference he chose was one we all have experienced. In fact, he chose only elements of pre-adulthood that were so simple the viewer didn't even have to reminisce. You can trace his own path in this. Over time he became an adult assaulting the world of children.And over time, the child in us started to fight back, because after a certain point we won't tolerate having our past stolen. We know we are unique. We know each time he uses our past as a generic wrapper it becomes homogenized with millions of other childhoods. So we choose to repel the invader.That's what makes these home alone movies so fascinating. He gets into a self-referential loop where the charm isn't about how successfully the adult invades the adolescent, but how successfully the child repels it.The problem is that as time goes on, even though these become more interesting virtual biography of the curse of writing, these become less interesting as amusements.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid. Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house. As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck. He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris.The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group. In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag. At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home. The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car. That means they will have to search them all one by one.Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away. The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower. Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag. Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4. We'll see.

Maybe this review will be biased by the late hour but while Home Alone 3 doesn't hold a candle to the original films for its key demographic which is likely young, young kids...eight to ten perhaps I think it hits its mark. With virtually no big names in the film it has to rely on the other aspect of the Home Alone franchise which is slapstick comedy, kiddie hi-jinks and ridiculously painful pranks that are taken like Wile Coyote. This film has plenty of that. Ironically the amazing late John Hughes did indeed pen the script for this film as silly as it is. The plot is barely that but Home Alone never relied heavily on any sort of plot. You watch it to see the above listed things. Home Alone 3 is sillier, kiddier, but still entertaining.Alex Linz headlines the cast as the vivacious youngster with ideal traps and toys. Linz is probably the perfect hero for the younger crowd. He doesn't exactly have enormous chemistry but he's cute and does a good job as the antagonist to the bad guys. Character actor Olek Krupa takes the role of head bad guy from the likes of Joe Pesci and the character is not entirely different. He is kind of a quiet dark brooding bad guy, seems out of place in a light fluff piece like this but maybe that makes his role work. He pulls off the silly comedy very well. Rya Kihlstedt does a good job playing the only lady baddie. She probably gets some of the best pranks and traps played on her. Lenny von Dohlen is the half witted bad guy and fills the shoes of Daniel Stern but loosely because something all three bad guys have in common Krupa, Kihlstedt, and Dohlen have very little character or plot. At least Pesci and Stern were fun characters with a story. This is just entirely about torturing the silly bad guys because kids don't care if the bad guys are people with a story. They are adults that are trying to ruin a kid's fun.This was directors Raja Gosnell's first entry into directing and he seems to be doing well currently having directed some solid family films and hopefully will exceed expectations at bringing The Smurfs to the big screen. He focuses on the comedy though I think and not necessary character development which works better for kiddie comedies than actual mainstream films. Still if you want to watch a silly movie with your kids you could do worse than Home Alone 3 but whatever you do, don't even begin to hold this in the same breath as either of the first Home Alone films which became a holiday comedy classic. This one is just cute. 6/10 "},{"Title":"The next Kevin McCallister? Not Likely...

The main reason why I and probably many others don't like it at first is simple- because we're comparing it to the first two movies.This is NOT a sequel, and it's not a remake either. The characters and story are completely different, so when you compare it to the previous movies and try to treat it as one of them, it's only natural to be unhappy with it. But when you treat it as something different, something new, rather than as part of a series, it's really quite good. There is really only one major thing that it has in common with the others, and that is that they all involve a kid setting up a bunch of traps to stop criminals. But the traps too, are different in many ways, often more complex, and the way they end is almost the opposite from the other movies. I would just about guarantee that if it had been given a different name and was treated as a new movie, rather than as the 3rd in the series, it would have had a significantly higher rating.When I treat it as something different, I enjoy it a lot, probably almost as much as the first two, and in some ways more. Some parts of it are not very realistic, but it's a lot of fun. And some parts are a bit frustrating, but in the end it all works out well.

Only this one is a new movie based on the idea of the first two, but doesn't star Macaulay Culkin or Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern, none of those guys. And, this one doesn't take place on Christmas, this one starts in January.        Four international spies Petr Beaupre, Burton Jernigan,Earl Unger, and Alice Ribbons, have smuggled a computer chip into the country in a toy car. The chip will make a missile untrackable and unstoppable once placed in one. But there's been a problem amix-up of luggage at the airport causes an old lady, Mrs. Hess, to take the toy car with chip home and the crooks are stuck with herluggage. REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT DO READ ON!       Mrs. Hess lives in Chicago, and her neighbor is 8-year-old Alex Pruitt. He shovels the snow off her driveway and she's anythingbut nice to him. She gives Alex the toy car, but that's not the only gift Alex receives, for when he returns home, he finds he has the chicken pox! And now the crooks have ventured into town. They know the street the chip is on, but not which house it's in. What to do? According to Mr. Beaupre Search them all. Because since it's the suburbs, nobody is home during the day, except for Alex who's home sick with the pox. Alex discovers Beaupre in two houses on two days and both times calls the police, but Beaupre manages to illute their grasp, so the police think it was a false alarm. Since nobody believes Alex, he takes matters into his own hands. He attaches a camcorder to the toy car and it films Beaupre searching the Alcott house, but that plan backfires drastically. These crooks have the most state of the art equipment phone splicers and tappers, even a device for debugging the burglar alarm on people's houses. Soon Beaupre, Jernigan, Alice and Unger discover who's behind this. They plan to go to Alex's house next, so it's time to set up the security. While the rest of thefamily sleeps, Alex rigs up booby traps like the other kid in the two previous Home Alone films. It's got electric fences, toppling trunks of books, toppling barbell, everything! Next day, they venture to the Pruitt house. Unger is electrofied by the fence,Alice falls in a mud puddle and two flower pots fall on her head, Jernigan finds a dummy attached to a lawn mower that comes crashing down on him, so after much more madness, Jernigan and Unger jump into a pool disguised as a trampoline, Alice breaks her back, and Beaupre hides in an igloo rigged with dynomite and is left at the mercy of Alex's smart allec bird.          So the four criminals go to jail, not only that, but they also have the chicken pox! The Air Force got the chip back, and Alex doesn't go unrewarded. But this film does not live up to the first two!It's funny and all, but it follows new storylines, which I guess isn't bad. Original stories which are in a series take some getting used to. Halloween III in the Halloween trilogy is a good example. It doesn'thave Michael Myers in it, it's based on the IDEA of HALLOWEEN and uses the title, kind of like Home Alone 3.          I wonder if they'll make a Home Alone 4. You think? I doubt it, but if they do, will it star Kevin McCallister or Alex Pruitt? Or maybe even another kid stalked by burglars. Could be!

The only connection that it shares with the other two is that it takes place in Chicago. I didn't know what to expect of this movie at first, but when I watched it, I didn't think that it was that bad. Is it as good as the first two movies? No. But is it still a funny movie in its own right? Yes. Home Alone 3 basically takes the usual formula that the first two films had, but changes it a little more. Instead of the main character being left behind, he's at home because he's ill, and the villains are a bunch of thieves who are seeking a computer chip. However, the film has the same kind of things that made the first two films enjoyable, and if you don't mind that the characters in this film are different, it's a film that's actually a very enjoyable experience.Alex D. Linz is the new protagonist, Alex Pruitt. Considering how I feel about most child actors, it was nice to see how good a job that Linz did with this film. While he wasn't as good a hero as Macaulay Culkin from the first two films was, Linz was still a good protagonist in his own right. The same goes with the rest of the cast, while their characters weren't as good as the ones from the first two films, I do give credit to them, as they made some pretty good characters in this film. And of course, the movie is very funny, with most of the laughs coming in the climactic showdown between Alex and the thieves.Like I just mentioned above, there are some big laughs in this movie. Most of them occurring in the climax. Another thing that this movie has are some neat traps. Alex makes some rather interesting traps as he tries to stop the thieves from getting the computer chip. Some of theme are even a little more extreme than the first two films, such as a bit with a lawnmower falling on one of the bad guy's face. although he comes out fine, just with his hair looking a little different. All in all, if you enjoyed the first two Home Alone movies, then you might like this third one, as though it's unrelated to the aforementioned films, it's still a good film in its own right. If you don't mind that this film has characters different from the first two films, as well as a plot that's different from the two previous ones, it's a good film. On a side note, this was the last Home Alone movie to be given a theatrical release, as the fourth one was a TV movie. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Not as good as the first two but it's OK..","Date":"1 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":" Different cast, different director, different everything even tho it's not perfect it's still better than the reviews that it has here.

This should not have been called Home Alone 3, but something else. I wouldn't go so far as to calling it the best in the series, but I do stand by this having the best storyline. The general premise about a little kid being home alone and creating booby-traps to catch the bad guys is the exact point of the first two, but it's what's beneath the surface that is the best. A group of bad guys steal an Air Force computer chip and must deliver it to a North Korean terrorist organization. They hide it in a remote control car where it is unintentionally picked up by a retired lady headed to suburban Chicago. Hr taking the bag was unrealistic; in an airport, who doesn't check to see if they have their own bag? Everybody knows some luggage look alike! She gives the car to her 8-year-old neighbour, Alex (Dinz) who just came down with the chicken pox. The thieves get the whereabouts of the neighbourhood, but break into each house hoping to find the car. Alex is home alone and sees the thieves through his telescope and calls the police. Everybody thinks he's crying wolf, but Alex is determined to catch the thieves once and for all. The thieves want to search in the daytime because they know everybody is either at school or working. What if there's people like Alex sick home from school? Or retirees? Then the place not believing Alex is also a bit unrealistic. He notices odd things happening in the neighbourhood ontop of intruders. The thieves are obviously experts, so wouldn't the cops work to plant hidden cameras or something like that? When it goes to classic Home Alone, the traps and slapstick comedy is just as great (sometimes greater) than the first two. Sure there's some unrealistic traps, but the first two had them also. Maybe it is just because I am a 90s kid, but I don't get why this is hated. Alex is just as good a Kevin, the thieves are cool, the story is better than the others. Home Alone 4 and 5 are the bad ones. I mean reeeeaaally bad.

The whole plot hinges on 4 criminals getting their bag containing a top-secret device getting mixed-up at the airport with a bag belonging to a senior citizen who lives in the suburbs of Chicago across the street from the hero of the film. They trace the bag to the suburbs, and the movie goes from there.But, the plot of the movie could have been solved in minutes (to the advantage of the villains rather than the hero) had the criminals (or at least the woman criminal who held onto the bag) simply kept the wrong bag and approached the senior citizen who had their bag after landing in Chicago to simply exchange bags. The senior citizen would have wanted her bag rather than the criminals' bag (she later indicates that she is angry about having the wrong bad rather than the correct bag), and the plot would have been solved right there. The criminals would have gotten away and we never would have been introduced to the hero, but the plot would have been as simple as it could be.PROS It has that late 1990s suburb feel to it, and the booby traps are slightly more realistic (as far as the criminals surviving them is concerned).

I never thought about the movie again... Until Netflix streaming. I could not get over the biggest hurdle - the bar that Culkin, Pesci, and Stern firmly established. Home Alone 3 is an excellent case of overcoming the Real McCoy status most people assigned to Home Alone 1 and 2. Any sequel that succeeded these didn't stand a chance unless it was released 20+ years later. That is the principal failure with Home Alone 3. This winter Home Alone 3 was available on Netflix streaming. I thought, It's a lazy day. I'm stuck inside. Let's see if I get past 10 minutes. I ended up ROFLOL. I watched it 3 more times that week! Then, I started wondering why I didn't give it a chance many years ago. That's when I figured it out. Culkin, Pesci, and Stern are the Home Alone Dream Team combo. Any Home Alone production that immediately followed them was destined to have a tough time even if the master writer John Hughes penned it.It's like your favorite player or coach going to a new team. It does not mean your team is worthless. It means things change. New stars emerge. From a technical POV, I was struck by how much spatial integrity was used in this film. You saw crucial characters (the kid and criminals) in the same shots together. There were no cop-out techniques used like the customary cuts and close-ups that trick the viewers into believing scenes were shot together when they weren't. Spatial Integrity takes time to setup and achieve precision timing. Home Alone 3 actually surpasses Home Alone 1 & 2 in several ways.1. Alex, the kid, has an infectious laugh. 2. Alex is sheer fun to watch. I love Alex's attitude with the police come to his house to dress him down about false alarms, and when he gives the criminals an Ouch moment. This kid emotes very well!3. Alex is smarter. John Hughes established at the top of the film this kid is different. He enters and wins science competitions unlike Kevin. We are told Kevin is le incompetent. We don't know how he magically gets skills to take out criminals. And we don't care because we're LOL. After watching Home Alone 3, I started to wonder, How did Kevin know how to do all that stuff?! 4. These criminals are serious, skilled, and full of themselves. That's why it's even funnier that they get taken down by a toddler. 5. Including a mouse and a talking and snoring parrot is brilliant.6. The supporting cast is better.7. And the story is superior. Thus, if you were like me many years ago that passed on this film, give it another chance. Don't compare it to the Dream Team productions. It's the ignored little brother or sister that has talent, which no one took the time to notice.

Also, I do miss the antics of the Wet Bandits, the new villains weren't as effective.All in all, a perfectly adequate, but uneven film, that is much better than its abysmal follow up. 5/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Not  too  bad!","Date":"5 December 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":" Having recently heard from the recorded commentary from the 2006 release of the original Home Alone film, this was going to be filmed back to back with the second one.Since it was made a trilogy at the time, Hughes and Columbus knew they needed new material. The twist on the third installment is original in it's own way and because of that the third film will always stand by itself.The one thing that I think should have been done differently is that Hughes and Columbus should have stuck with two bad guys. The character of Bopre is enough to need just one. He alone could have saved the fourth film from being shelved and disregarded. Other than that I have not problem with the movie.

For one thing, we see that the kid is not left home alone unintentionally. They had a good reason (actually several), and yeah chicken pox can be serious. For another thing, we have not two criminals, but four, and they really know what they're doing throughout 95% of the film (until the traps are set off). Olek, Rya, Lonny, and David really put character into their roles. We have a believable plot, whereas a kid with the chicken pox finds that he has to protect a missile chip from international thieves who are working for a terrorist organization. Alex (as Alex) delivered, and the traps were well put together and very clever. The last scene was funny too, where the main aftermath for the criminals was chicken pox.

It's hard to separate John Hughes with the HOME ALONE formula, and there's a question of why. I mean HOME ALONE, while a decent and likable film with a high box-office count, wasn't THAT great. It's not worth seeing over and over again as different films. Hughes doing a sequel, HOME ALONE 2 LOST IN NEW YORK, was understandable, but why could he stop when even he knows the red-light is on. As producer, perhaps the blames on Hughes why there's a knife-wielding thug in the big-screen version of DENNIS THE MENACE. After that, he did BABY'S DAY OUT, which takes out the eight-year old kid and the two bumbling burglars and replaces them with a baby and the Three Stooges (actually, inspired by them). Doesn't he know when it's time to wrap it up? Actually no, as he produces (and writes) HOME ALONE 3, a second sequel to the already overused HOME ALONE formula. Actually, however, HOME ALONE 3 is slightly better than other HOME ALONE imitators, even if this one isn't far from being one itself. But for the record, I enjoyed HOME ALONE 3 more than see three full grown men and baby or a smarmy old thug matching wits with Dennis the Menace. Instead of bringing back Macaulay Culkin to play the kid, they probably felt that he (and the audience) have gone far too old for the role, so they instead settle for a much younger and juvenile Alex D. Linz, who actually makes a charming replacement which doesn't try to duplicate his predecessor. And instead of bringing back the two thugs, they settle for four more, and these time, their not Wet Bandits (or Sticky Bandits, whatever!). They're a couple of thieves searching for a microchip which they put inside a remote control car. Accidentally, they get their bags mixed up with an old lady (Marian Seldes), who then gives it to little Alex. So it's bad day for the thugs again, ain't it always? In comparison to its predecessors, HOME ALONE 3 is just another pale imitation. Rating **1/2 out of 5.

It's a lot of fun seeing how this little boy outwits slick and (supposedly) well-trained international black market spies. He's also sensitive to his elderly neighbor and far more genuous than his counterpart in the first two films.

They missed the point, however. Home Alone converged a set of unlikely yet plausible nightmarish premises and played them out delightfully; Home Alone 2 succeeded by stretching those premises to the limits for parody's sake and inserting clever references at every turn as a kind of tribute to its predecessor.Home Alone 3, on the other hand, turns on the convergence of one completely uninteresting premise--a kid home alone sick from school--and one completely thoughtless premise--an international terrorist conspiracy. Dissecting such highbrow criminals is perhaps not a task within these filmmakers' abilities, but we never know, because they don't even try. But if the villains are bad, the protagonists are even worse cardboard-cutouts, clichéd baby geniuses and greedy bullies, ultimately unsympathetic all around. The conclusion is predictable and contrived, and by then any will to care about these dummies has long since run out.There is no excuse for this. Every member of the original Home Alone cast was cleverly shown to be human, even at their most stylized and most disgraceful points, including the antagonists. Home Alone 3 does not belong in its namesake's franchise. It is an unoriginal, implausible, shameful capitalization.

If only I saw a trailer, I'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes.But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he write it as well?

It's the cream of the crop, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.First off, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff.The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once, rather, I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird, rather than providing comic relief, was unfunny and annoying.The acting, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well, that's it.I can see some people saying Man, it's for the kids. Don't dis it, man. Well MAN, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! So in short, this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is, it completely insults the first two as well.

It seems that after those films, movies with slapstick humor where a kid takes down adults haven't worked that well. Another film I reviewed which I prefer and it has a lot of similarities to the two Home Alone films is Blank Check which didn't do as well. They have since done 5 Home Alone movies, and while I agree that they didn't need 4 and 5, it seems like everybody's complaint is having a different kid in the Home Alone movies besides Macaulay Culkin, and different burglars besides Harry and Marv not wanting to give the other Home Alone movies a chance. I guess they didn't need to put the title Home Alone in them. Out of all the Home Alone movies that have been made, this one is like my favorite for a few reasons. I remember watching this film over and over as a kid. Let's think, you can watch the trailer and beginning of the movie, and it won't seem like a Home Alone movie, which is a common movie complaint. But, by all means the trailer and opening scenes are really cool. That being said, I like the criminals in this movie better than in any of the Home Alone movies, as the burglars are mostly cheesy in the other movies except Harry. This time, rather than burglars trying to rob houses they are terrorists looking for a computer chip in a neighborhood, for some kind of terror plot that is hard to understand. These 4 criminals are quite smart, and this time they use technology which is even incredible years later, as the prior Home Alone movies didn't show much technology, like no computer in their house or anything. The way these criminals work together as a team is astounding. Other things that make this movie better, one is I like Alex better than Kevin. Alex is a cute kid, and remembering the prior Home Alone films, we can remember how Kevin has a bad attitude, the way he talked to his mom and family in the beginning of the movie, would get a lot of us in trouble. Kevin seemed selfish wanting to spend a lot of time alone. Alex is a more likable kid, and seems like a more typical kid than Kevin, he is no where near as bratty or selfish. He also seems smarter, as Kevin didn't seem like a smart kid, only enough to set up traps. Alex seems like quite an intelligent kid and respectful. He is the only one in his neighborhood aware that houses are getting broken into, as the terrorists didn't leave behind any evidence of burglary. Alex is also more of a role model than Kevin, especially in a scene where Alex talks about taking action and becoming defensive. It sounds better than when Kevin said, This Is My House, I Have To Defend It. I also like Alex's neighborhood more than Kevin's, as I feel like his neighborhood is more of a typical middle class neighborhood, and in Alex's neighborhood all the houses look the same keeping the criminals from knowing which house the computer chip is in, while in Kevin's neighborhood, we only know of a couple of houses and it seems like the burglars are mostly after Kevin's house. I feel like Alex's family, is more of a typical family than Kevin's family. Rather than see a big family getting ready for vacation, this movie does not take place during Christmas, but early in January where we see his family and neighborhood in routine activities like work and school seeming like a realistic community. Mrs. Hess also seemed more like a typical neighbor than Old Man Marley or the Pigeon Lady. I also like the music in the movie, including the song My Town. Earlier today, I listened to that song on YouTube and after hearing that empowering song and seeing a couple of comments from people who like this one better, I decided to write a review for this movie when I wrote one way back in 2003. I deleted that previous review. The movie does get a little cheesy when the action takes place changing the terrorists characters, by all means it is still a great movie. Some of us will love it and some will hate it, but seriously if it bothers you that it's a Home Alone movie you should overlook that. I give this movie a 9/10, it getting cheesy gives it a lower review but I really like this movie for my title of terrorists being in a neighborhood that seemed like any neighborhood. It's interesting to think of international terrorists in a typical neighborhood with an 8 year old boy.

That is the least of its problems. What was fresh in the first two HA movies is now mundane. Every gag is the same people get bonked upside the head with things and fall down. Alex D.

In fact, the Home Alone term shouldn't be used in the title anyway. It should be used to define the genre or the sub-genre or the sub-sub-genre of this movie. The only other similarity is the presence of producer John Hughes, who also produced the first two Home Alone movies.Other than these two little facts, Home Alone 3 shares nothing with its predecessors. The lead character (and actor de facto) is different, the antagonists are different and the story is very different.Macaulay Culkin left his place to Alex D. Linz, who plays Alex (not too difficult, isn't it?), a small boy who lives in Chicago suburbia and has just caught chicken pox.The result is that he has to stay home while his brother and sister (who's played by young Scarlett Johansson) go to school and his parents go to work. His mother can't find a baby-sitter so Alex is left home alone (understood?).What you'd expect from that successful series effectively happens a group of burglars (this time four, not two) are searching for a missing microchip and they attempt to find it in Alex's neighborhood.Alex calls police twice when he witnesses the burglars' actions but they escape each time, so Alex is accused of making prank calls. In order to clear his name (if I can say it this way), Alex intends to catch the burglars by himself and by booby-trapping his house (surprised?), which is supposed to be next house on the list because the burglars go house by house.Because this is the third movie of an already exhausted film series, the result is exactly what you'd expect. The movie is unoriginal, unfunny and cannot work.The actors are incredibly bad. Alex D. Linz doesn't deliver the job very well and all of the other actors act in a foreseeable way and look like typical movie stereotypes.The villains aren't exactly a disaster because they deliver fair laughs when they need to. I particularly liked Rya Kihlstedt whose portrayal of the nasty girl with black hair gives some gravity. Olek Krupa's performance as burglar chief Beaupre isn't so bad neither.The movie is so bad because it has absolutely everything it needs to be classed as a 'turn-your-brain-off' movie.The storyline is less than weak, the logic is totally absent and the conveyed humor is totally inappropriate. It is supposed to be a family movie but it has more gross-out humor than any other form of comedy, including the legendary slapstick, which makes that kind of film so funny.However, when the coveted slapstick moments finally happen, the movie becomes really funny. Unfortunately, these kind of comic pieces don't work so well in film and should be presented as a series of sketches. I can't understand how a eight-year old boy could set all this in a single night and how he could know the working of every tool he uses. I can't figure how his parents or his brother and sister don't wake up in the middle of the night because of the noises. But frankly, am I supposed to ask all of these questions? Home Alone 3 is directed by Raja Gosnell, a film editor whose previous works include Good Morning, Vietnam and Pretty Woman. I guess he got his first directing job because he also was the editor of the first two Home Alone movies and he frequently worked with director Chris Columbus. But Gosnell shows that he's not very good in directing and he would also prove us several times in the future with movies like Big Momma's House and Scooby-Doo. His views of comedy don't work here, but he just seems to follow the logic that this movie will be a success only by the title name. In other words, another commercially-minded director. So sad.I would say that the only merit that this movie have is that it shows actors who shouldn't be cast in any other movie due to their low skills.So please, stop the series. We've got too much of it now. "},{"Title":"Wow!

He is left alone in the house, cuz he is sick.Entire story looks more real and authentic. This is entirely different story and as i mentioned i can't understand why they named that Home Alone. First two movies are great, but this one is better and it shouldn't be compare with previous, cuz it is not like them. This is not sequel for first and second movie. This is new story, new movie. I knew that before i saw it and that's why i wasn't disappointed from this one. I liked it very much, even more than Home Alone 1 and 2.  "},{"Title":"3.7/10? You gotta be kidding","Date":"9 July 2003","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":"  Home Alone 3 3.7/10? In this 3rd film, Alex Pruitt,(played by Alex D. Linz) is Home Alone with the chicken pox. The burglars are looking for a computer chip hidden in a toy car that Alex got from shoveling snow. I would have to admit, this wasn't as good as Home Alone or Home Alone 2 Lost in New York, but it still deserved more 3.7 out of 10!A good family film. More like 6.3/10 starsPG contains the slapstick action, a swear or two, and an image of partial nudity.-Kevin Kilbride- "},{"Title":"I liked this one better than the first two...yes I'm serious...","Date":"21 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":"  Home Alone 3 is a feel good comedy that delivers great acting,a slightly different plot,and some funny parts.The plot is almost the same basic thing,but it had some different approaches in it.Instead of the parents leaving their kid home alone accidentaly,the kid stays home from the chicken pox.New comer Alex D. Linz gives a surprisingly good performance,and the new thungs give good performances,but not as good as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.There is now four criminals in this movie,which means more traps,and now the criminals have a new motive.Some of the comedy in this movie is funny,but most of it is childrens humor.For one thing,I'm f****** surprised that ROGER EBERT liked this.I would strongly recommend Home Alone 3 to children and I would also recommend it for adults.Call me crazy but I liked this movie better than the first two,I dont know why,but this one has a more different approach.Home Alone was great,Home Alone 2 was o.k,but Home Alone 3 was the best.10 out of 10. "},{"Title":"The Best!!","Date":"11 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":"    Yes, I said it. This movie is the best of the series. I only liked the first two really for Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern's slapstick and Laurel-and-Hardy humor. Maculay No-Talent can mug and scream all he wants, but right down to it, he's irritating !! Alex D. Linz is the funniest thing under four feet tall that I have ever seen. His facial expresssions, quirks and grimaces are hilarious for me to watch, but there is a leap of logic on how he can get so many complicated booby traps ready on time or how he can keep abreast of four so-called deadly terrorists. From his Rear Window perspective, he watches them through the neighborhood, keeps them on a merry chase and turns them into bumbling idiots with a little smile and a lot of charm. I also have to mention that Rya Kihlstedt, the actress/wife Ally McBeal's Gil Bellows, who plays the female terrorist is a mega-babe with her black hair and blue eyes. There's too many blondes running loose in Hollywood. This is such a departure from the unlikely premises of the first two movies inasmuch as Alex plays a bored kid stuck at home and not one overly and conveniantly misplaced. I can still see the fourth one in the series coming with Pesci and Stern This isn't Kevin. This brat won't have a house full of booby traps waiting for us!
