[{"Title":"Does What A Thriller Should, No More, No Less","Date":"29 May 2001","Score":"44 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Along Came A Spider works.  It may suffer from one plot twist too many, it may borrow liberally from other pictures, it may have narrative holes you could run a horse race through, but in spite of all that, it WORKS.  And as everyone knows, that is about the highest compliment a film like this can be paid.Directed by Lee Tamahori, Along Came a Spider hits the ground running with a bravura sequence in which a federal sting goes horribly wrong and a good agent dies.  Det. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), the leader of the sting, goes into brooding isolation, but a year later, the daughter of a U.S. congressman (Michael Moriarty) is kidnapped from her prestigious Washington boarding school by a brilliant madman, and Cross, a mental wizard with the ability to see into the mind of the maddest psychopath, is the only one who can track the criminal's M.O. and save the girl.Standard thriller territory, and it's given more or less standard treatment, albeit with a fair share of stylistic spark and energy.  Tamahori does a good job choreographing his action set pieces, particularly that shattering opening and a nifty cat-and-mouse chase that closes out the picture. Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti gives the film a dark, brooding visual richness, and Jerry Goldsmith contributes another thunderously effective thriller score.The acting is also generally strong across the board.  Morgan Freeman.. what can one say?  I honestly cannot think of another modern actor who has done such consistently high-quality work.  Granted, Cross does not seem like a role that would overly tax a top-notch thespian like Freeman, but he doesn't sell it short either, giving the character his full, commanding force.  He is the tough, solid center that really elevates Along Came A Spider above pulp territory.  Michael Wincott plays the psycho (as naturally he would; what else is Michael Wincott going to play in a film?), and gives it his gravelly-voiced best, making us hate this guy just as much as we should. Monica Potter is fine as the young security officer helping Cross track the fiend, but I was constantly distracted by the fact that her voice sounds EXACTLY LIKE JULIA ROBERTS!  I swear, it sounded like she'd been dubbed. Am I the only one who noticed this?  Probably, so I'll drop it.If there's any real complaint to be had with Along Came A Spider (aside from my weird personal difficulties with Monica Potter's voice), it is an age-old one for a thriller  script problems.  Screenwriter Marc Moss keeps things moving nicely, and there are some clever moments throughout, but the film also raises unanswered questions.  What was the purpose of the weird Lindbergh website the kidnapper sets up?  When will they learn that internet-related plot devices just don't work in films?  What was the point of the Russian kid who seems to play such a big role in the middle portion of the picture?  Why did Moss feel the need to crib his most exciting sequence, a footchase with the maniac leading Cross through Washington via cell phone, from Dirty Harry?  Granted, I haven't read the novel by James Patterson upon which this film was based, so I may not be casting blame in the right place.  But Patterson didn't write this script, so maybe I am.As I mentioned before, however, all of this largely doesn't matter.  In the moment, while it's unfurling in front of you, the film's fast pace, engaging performances, and visual polish keep you intrigued, and allow you to overlook the plot's more outrageous contrivances and awkward reversals. Along Came A Spider is not a perfect thriller, but brother..it WORKS.

Along with the FBI agent who was in charge of security at the scene of the crime, he follows the clues laid out by the kidnapper in order to find the girl. And so the story goes. The kidnapper is portrayed by the always formidable Michael Wincott, the best serial villain on that side of the Atlantic. He should have the Best Supporting Role awards piled up in his attic.  Alex Cross, whom we remember from Kiss the Girls, and portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is just the kind of cop you like best sincere, sympathetic, intelligent, thorough and committed.  Monica Potter features as the FBI agent determined to redeem herself after she let the kidnapper escape.

Along Came a Spider, based on a novel by James Patterson, is not on that level. It is not really a sequel, but more a continuation of the adventures of Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross. It is a well-made movie with good performances and effective, unexpected plot twists and startling surprises, but so much of it is too conventional. As I watched the film, often spotting ample plot holes, I was astonished at how recycled so many of the scenes were. There is a sequence that has Cross running throughout a busy city during rush hour to deliver a ransom. The killer commands him to race from one location to the next answering pay phones. Gee, we have never seen this idea before.	Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Alex Cross who finds himself in complete grief and remorse after losing a partner during an undercover operation that we see at the beginning of the film. It starts out quick as his time of regret is shattered when he gets a phone call from a killer who just kidnapped the 12 year old daughter of the Senator (Michael Moriarty). We know this man as a school teacher named Mr. Soneji (Michael Wincott). Although under the secret service protection by Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) and Ben Devine (Billy Burke), Soneji devised an articulate plan and now holds the girl captive on his boat.	I dare not reveal any more of the story. There are several ninety degree twists that play games with our mind. However, they are disposable and essentially unneeded, and only rationalize familiar clich√©s. Some of them are fun, but they seem to crawl out of holes in the plot. As the movie continues, it only becomes more absurd. And it is particularly vulnerable to logic, or perhaps it is just poorly edited. For instance, what if the detectives missed any of the killer's clues? Any given clue? Then what? His entire plan would be shot to hell because each clue he leaves sets the police up for the next one. So I question why do killers always want to play elaborate cat and mouse games with detectives?Unlike Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider lacks suspense and thrills because there is little tension in its structure. We already know the killer's identity-but do we? The movie certainly ends up on different floors than where I thought it would land, and it works to some extent. I still think the movie could have had some more thrilling moments of suspense and chills instead of indulging in a crime case that is not really all that involving. Actually, we never really care if the killer is caught. Since the film's villain is so much more interesting than the good guys, I was actually rooting for him in some scenes. When the girl tries to escape from Soneji, I was hoping she would be caught, because I wanted Soneji to lay down more puzzle pieces for Cross. 	There are nice moments here, effective scenes of action. Morgan Freeman is a little too calm and collected for such an intense situation, though. Monica Porter has a great performance, however, in one of the film's trickiest roles. Along Came a Spider, directed by Lee Tamahori (The Edge, Mulholland Falls) has a lot of potential-but strays from its roots and becomes just another contrived thriller in which we have already seen countless times before.

The film is aimed at viewers who like crime puzzles and mind games. There's lots of action and dark suspense.The film's underlying concept is fascinating and clever. But the screenplay overlays the ingenious concept with implausible, and at times confusing, plot twists. After my second viewing I still had unanswered questions.The screenplay had another weakness. At least seven times, it used TV news coverage of the abduction to advance the plot. Relying on TV news reporting is a stale and tiresome plot device that detracts from any film, in my opinion. Here, its repetitiveness made it even more irritating.The film's characters were not particularly interesting. Freeman's Alex Cross was dull and plodding; Potter's Jezzie Flannigan was nasal and humorless. And the melodramatic music was manipulative and too loud.Along Came A Spider does have entertainment value, derived from its suspenseful action, and cloak and dagger intrigue, enhanced by excellent cinematography and good set design. I just wish that the film's screenplay had been as clever as the concept upon which the screenplay was based.

He is definitely that in this film although his character, Alex Cross, is a little too sharp for believability. There were just a bit too many oh, come on's said by me watching this as Cross would get computer passwords with no trouble, etc. The odds of that happening are millions-to-one but not in the world of films. There were other examples, too, of him figuring out things that were almost impossible.For a tough modern-day crime story this film, for the most part, was pretty low- key with low profanity and not a lot of gore or overdone action. That was surprising considering the sordid subject matter. The tameness in here, and Freeman, make this a notch (albeit a small one) above the average thriller.

It is just a generic movie and a pretty decent generic movie at that.  Lets face it, every plot is based on clich√©s. What counts is how these clich√©s are used.  The screenwriter's challenge is this Can he blow enough smoke and juggle his mirrors in such a way as to make the viewer believe he is seeing something new or, at least, enjoy the same old crap?  Shakespeare did it.  Dickens did it.  Stephen King has made a career out of it.  The problem with Along Came a Spider is that no-frills clich√©s are all you get, basic and unadorned. The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters, a bar code and the word `Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay, I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.To make sure you are getting your moneys worth, the writers have thrown in a `Guaranteed Surprise Ending. Now some movies sport twist endings that are knockouts.  These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying; they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film.  Think of The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or The Crying Game. First, in all these movies the ending was prepared for.  No matter how unexpected ultimately the twists make sense in the terms of the logic of the movie.  Second, you recognize these movies as superior long before you reach the conclusion.  Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances, the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot.  The twist came as icing on an already fine cake. Along Came A Spider has a surprise ending because, well, 'Thrillers' have `Surprise Endings'.  That's all.  You probably won't guess it, but even so you won't be all that surprised.  You will realize that since because such and such happens, the movie can only end in two or three different ways. Like the rest of the movie the twist is mechanical and non-descript.  It's satisfying enough but it operates more as a punctuation mark than anything else.This sounds like a pretty negative review - and I guess it is.  In fairness I should say I enjoyed myself watching it.  A predictable experience is not necessarily a bad experience.  Sometimes all you want is a no frills `Thriller'.  You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal, so what do you do?  Sure, a movie that saut√©s it's clich√©s with a bit more sauce and spice would be preferable, but if your only other option is a Matlock rerun, Along Came A Spider looks pretty darn good!

Morgan Freeman is the profiler/cop who delves into the criminal's mind. Monica Potter is his cop partner. It's a shame to see a marvelous actor like Freedman wasted on trite stuff like this. He has an endearingly lumpy face and a soothing voice, the kind of guy you wouldn't mind going to for reassurance when you're in doubt. He can be mighty mean too, as in Street Smart. Potter is as glamorous as all get-out. She looks a little and sounds a lot like Julia Roberts, a comparison that must make her physically ill by now. Unfortunately her voice is flat and toneless and her face mostly expressionless. She'd be a great model though. The kidnapper of a senator's little girl is Michael Wincott, a very expressive face and a voice that sounds filtered through a coffee grinder. He has a bony face, rather like a weasel or ferret, but not necessarily villainous, a term that in my view is slung around much too loosely. I myself am eminently handsome yet I too have been described as villainous. I didn't mind it from my ex wife but it can be unnerving when brought up independently in the confessional and in a shrink's office. The script has nothing original in it. The dialog is by the numbers, the characters and their interactions not very interesting. The action, and there is a lot of action, as is standard in routine thrillers, takes place in Washington, DC, and makes use of many recognizable locations. One rather lengthy sequence is lifted straight out of the Ann Mary Deacon incident in Dirty Harry, the writers beginning to run dry I guess. Something to do with the Lindbergh kidnapping is introduced ominously and then left to flop around, gasping, until it expires. A couple of plot twists at the end can't save this damaged script. The most surprising thing about it is that Dylan Baker, as the head FBI man, usually a dilatory figure, has a chilling face, and begins by chewing out Freeman, a local cop, because of a turf conflict. But then, in the very next scene, he apologizes and offers to help as much as he can -- and he means it too! It's diverting but no more than that.

I suspect that most real ones probably do, actually. But in Along Came A Spider, there are at least two occasions when Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman at his most Morgan Freeman-esque) has the opportunity to end a standoff by just popping a suspect in the leg rather than shooting them in the chest. Winging a suspect might allow for, say, a trial and sentences. All that good legal stuff. Instead, though, Cross feels perfectly comfortable killing suspects after either realizing they don't have any new information, or that they were actually guilty. This raises the question of when you last saw a thriller in which the cop or investigator captures the criminal at the end, puts them on trial, and gets their cathartic release watching them get sentenced to life in prison. Nah. Instead movies just look for cool ways for the hero to waste the bad guy in the final reel. And when that wasting occurs in a dull manner, as is the case with Along Came a Spider (I don't feel I've given too much away here)... Well, what's the point?Along Came A Spider begins with a tragic accident in which Alex Cross leads a botched sting operation that leaves his partner dead (in a horrid special effects sequence). Cross is so shattered he hasn't recovered 8 months later. That's what we're told, at least. Mostly Morgan Freeman just looks a little tired. Once he gets launched on a new case, though, the 8 months of depression cease to be a factor. The new case involves the kidnapping of the daughter of a US Senator. The kidnapper (gravel voiced Michael Wincott) seems to want fame, I guess, though it's never fully important. Cross picks up a new partner in the Secret Service agent who feels responsible for the girl's kidnapping (Monica Potter). For around ten seconds Cross has an adversarial relationship with a federal agent (Dylan Baker) who is leading the investigation until he drops jurisdiction and basically lets Cross take over. Things twist and turn and there are surprises and double-crosses galore.The fact that the surprises really aren't surprising is a moderate problem. The number of little details that make no sense are more problematic. There's a series of clues involving a Charles Lindbergh web page and web cam that are pretty foolish. In fact, any time the film references computers it seems out of its element. Every detail is off. But since the computer stuff is basically the only detective work in the movie, you've gotta wonder about things. At the end, Cross hacks into a suspect's computer, for example. He figures out the password in an arbitrary manner (and then enters the password into the only security field in computer history that actually shows the letters in a password onscreen as you type them) and he pretty much clicks on a series of files that might as well be labeled Motive, Kidnapping Evidence, and Where I'm Hiding Away. But I guess we don't see these movies for their realism. But absent any thrills, I guess I'm at a loss. Beyond the obviousness of the plot, nothing about Along Came A Spider is really bad. But I have equally little to recommend it.Like Kiss the Girls, Along Came A Spider is based on a novel by James Patterson. And like Kiss the Girls, Along Came A Spider is directed by a man who started in independent films and has graduated to making indistinct run-of-the-mill Hollywood thrillers. Lee Tamahori first made his mark with the searing Once Were Warriors, but since then he's gone from bland (The Edge) to dull (Mulholland Falls) to blankly innocuous (here). His style, which once seemed so fresh, has been so subverted that his next assignment is helming a James Bond film, the ultimate reward for a director who gets the job done without letting such irrelevances as personal style and vision cloud his judgement. In Along Came A Spider, Tamahori does nothing to call attention to himself, but also offers nothing of originality to goose the narrative along. Basically the suspense involves lots of thunderstorms, dark dank hiding places, and children in peril. That plus a climactic chase that makes you yearn for the skill of Dirty Harry. But basically all of the technical aspects of the film are acceptable (damning praise).Morgan Freeman, of course, is never anything less than an intelligent, composed, strong on-screen presence and you frankly wish more depth could be added to the Alex Cross screen persona so that Freeman could have a little more acting fun. As his foil, Monica Potter is, as always, a blonder, blander version of Julia Roberts. Potter's only true acting success, in my book, was in the Robert Towne Prefontaine story Without Limits. Otherwise, she's pretty much coasted on charm and a resemblance to the biggest star in Hollywood. In the smaller supporting parts Wilcott is fine, Baker is wasted, and you wonder how Penelope Ann Miller's career has disintegrated to the point where she has a half dozen lines here as the kidnapped girl's mother.So it's hard to know what to say about Along Came A Spider. You could pick at its plot holes for hours. But trying to pick it apart cinematically is a pointless endeavor. There's not much wrong, but there's not much here. This is a totally mediocre 5/10 film.

From the opening scene this is pure Hollywood with its clunky CGI and its simplistic plot device of the dead partner and so we continue with a fairly uninspiring thriller that is engaging enough but never does anything that special. It doesn't help that the primetime schedules are full of versions of Alex Cross in TV series mysteries but generally this film just plods its way through a story that isn't obvious so much as it is uninspiring. It is an enjoyable enough mystery that is professionally handled but it lacks imagination and flair. The twists come but the film is not exciting enough to prevent the audience from thinking and, in thinking it is easy to rip massive holes in the logic of the whole thing &#150; and thinking a plot is a bit silly doesn't help keep one interested. Tamahori directs without any distinction &#150; he isn't bad but again he doesn't do anything of that much interest.Instead he sits back and hopes that Morgan Freeman doing Morgan Freeman's Zen-cool&#153; will be enough to carry the audience along with the whole affair. Luckily for him this does work to some degree because Freeman on his day could sell shoes to fish. He is solid and professional even if he is underserved by the script. Wincott is good in a role that he could have made more of but instead is controlled and restrained. Potter is blond and dull and is not suited one jot to the role that her character grows into during the film. Baker deserves a bigger role while Miller, Horsford and a few others provide familiar faces.Overall then an entertaining but uninspired affair that pushes the right buttons but doesn't aspire to anything beyond the genre. The cast and the budget help but the story gets weaker the longer it goes on and although it will do enough for some viewers, it is nothing that special.

It kicks off with a bang. Unfortunately, this opening scene quickly destroyed my respect for the film and cashed in the only suspension-of-disbelief chip it held only minutes in. Someone as intelligent as Morgan Freeman's Alex Cross is supposed to be should have been able to come up with a better plan than this to trap a serial rapist. How in the world did he expect anyone to protect her while he's driving the car? The suspect has too much control in the situation. True, Cross kicks himself for it later, but I don't find it realistic that he would have put his partner's life at that much risk in the first place. Spider isn' t awful. But for a thriller, I found it to be less than engaging. Too bad because it's a good story. Secret Service agents outsmarting a criminal mastermind and turning it into an opportunity for themselves is a great concept. Now I'd like to read the novel. It's surely better.Tamahori and writer Marc Moss' execution of it is decent. No one's going to see that last big twist coming. You know something is off the whole time, just by the way Soneji is painted. The character is such a wreck, I'd have been disappointed if it HAD actually been him behind everything. One thing is guaranteed in a thriller like this There's always someone bigger waiting in the shadows. So Moss wisely chooses not to even try fooling us into thinking otherwise. The problem is that he keeps you guessing for too long. There is that whole sequence immediately following Soneji's failed attempt at kidnapping Dmitri, where nothing that happens makes any sense. This includes Cross' silly run through downtown D.C. (though at his age, you have to admire how nimble Freeman is).  He's asking himself why Soneji is just now asking for money, and so are we, especially seeing as we know Soneji doesn't have Megan any more. I think it would have helped if the audience didn't know the girl was gone at that point. Maybe show him returning to the boat and finding her gone after the train scene (but still do the scene right after the stakeout where he returns to the boat, only cut before showing Megan's compartment empty). That would have made it look like Soneji was simply becoming more desperate, having not scored his primary target. Hmmm.Placing Monica Potter in the rogue agent role was either a stroke of genius or a big miscast, I can't decide which. Just being who she is draws away all suspicion. Seeing her blow a guy's brains out was pretty freaky. It was like watching in an innocent child waving a gun around, not knowing the damage it can do. If this is the unsettling effect they were looking for, well, mission accomplished. Even so, something's off and it's this why make her a complete lunatic? It's too much of a leap in too short a time span.  Changes like this in characters need to be more gradual. Her wanting to kill Megan goes too far and is a plot flaw anyway (thanks T). She's got the money, why not just let the kid go? Heck, she could even continue being an agent if she wanted to. Jezzie's sudden change in demeanor is designed to create a more rousing ending to the film, but it doesn't make sense.For a much more intense, truly entertaining kidnap-themed film, try Ransom if you haven't seen it. I'm disappointed in Tamahori, who after making the great, David Mamet-penned The Edge, raised himself to a pretty high standard. Despite the mess Spider is, I hope Freeman takes the Alex Cross character for another spin. The man deserves a successful franchise.Grade D+     "},{"Title":"Unconvincing, Hackneyed and Clich√©-Ridden","Date":"7 December 2007","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Along Came a Spider makes use of two of the most overworked clich√©s of the modern crime drama. The first is the criminal who commits his crimes as a sort of intellectual exercise and then plays games with the police by deliberately leaving them clues. In reality, of course, most criminals are motivated either by greed or by strong emotions such as anger, hatred or jealousy rather than by the desire to commit the perfect crime for its own sake; Leopold and Loeb may have been exceptions, but even they were not stupid enough to taunt the police in the manner of some fictional criminals. The second clich√© of which the film-makers are guilty is that of the twist, the sudden revelation of information, previously withheld from the audience, which makes them aware that the true situation is not what they had previously been led to believe. Such twists normally occur towards the end of the film, and often involve the disclosure of information about the identity or motivation of one or more of the characters.The modern fashion for the pseudo-intellectual criminal, who commits crimes so that he can play a sort of mental chess with the detective, seems to have started with The Silence of the Lambs (in itself a reasonably good film). This fashion was followed in weaker films such as the overrated Se7en and the predictable The Bone Collector. The villain in Along Came a Spider is not (as in the examples quoted above) a serial killer but a kidnapper. His real name appears to be Jonathan Mercusio, but in the film he is normally referred to by his alias Gary Soneji. Soneji poses as a teacher in order to infiltrate an exclusive boarding school and kidnap the daughter of a senator. Soneji, who is obsessed with the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case from the thirties, then contacts the police to let them know what he has done and to give clues as to the girl's whereabouts. The title of the film derives from a comparison made between Soneji and a spider.The investigation of the crime is entrusted to Alex Cross, the Washington Police Department detective originally contacted by Soneji, and Jezzie Flanagan, the female Secret Service agent who was assigned to protect the girl and who failed to prevent her kidnapping. Like Jezzie, Cross is haunted by guilt, in his case over an earlier incident in which a female partner was killed. Like The Bone Collector, Along Came a Spider teams an older African-American male detective with a younger white female one. In both cases the female character has an Irish surname (Donaghy in the earlier film).Morgan Freeman is a highly talented actor, as he showed in films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Glory and Unforgiven, but his talents are often wasted in routine thrillers; Along Came a Spider is an example, and his next film High Crimes another. (Freeman also played the detective in Se7en; I have not seen Kiss the Girls, the other film in which he played the role of Alex Cross). Monica Potter gives a rather wooden performance as Jezzie; she is not as good as Angelina Jolie, who played the equivalent role in The Bone Collector, and certainly not as good as Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs.I won't say what the twist is that occurs near the end of the film, as I don't want to write a spoiler, although I must say it is not a credible one. Indeed, it has the effect of casting doubt on most of what has gone before, converting a believable if routine thriller into one that makes no sense at all. (John Schlesinger achieved a similarly dubious feat the previous year in Reindeer Games, which featured not one but two separate twists). The writers of crime fiction, especially scriptwriters for films like this, generally have far more fertile imaginations than do the criminals themselves; consequently fictitious criminals tend to hatch over-complicated and unworkable schemes which no real-life criminal would entertain for a minute. Along Came a Spider is the sort of unconvincing, hackneyed, clich√©-ridden thriller of which Hollywood has been churning out far too many in recent years. 4/10 "}{"Title":"The spider came along but really not that surprising","Date":"17 November 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Morgan Freeman is, as ever, terrific in this movie which must have looked good as a written script.

It's a thriller, where Morgan Freeman brings back the role of detective/profiler/mind-reader Alex Cross, who you may remember from Kiss the Girls.  It's based on the novel by Patterson, which I haven't read, about the kidnapping of a senator's daughter.  It was OK, but it could have been so much better in the hands of a great screenwriter.  Instead, it feels like Hollywood mailed this one in once Freeman signed on.The movie reminded me of the movies they show on the Lifetime network.  I watched this movie with my wife and she loved it as much as she loves the Lifetime marathons on Sunday.  The problem with Lifetime movies, and ACAS, is that they all treat the audience members like total idiots.  Important knowledge about the story is handed to the main characters, characters know or remember things that you wouldn't expect, etc.  Instead of creating an interesting way to get from A to B, we go straight out the A door and into the B door, as if the only reason the story even happens is so that we get caught by the plot twist at the end.  It's not suspenseful, and the only reason we get caught by surprise at all is because we've been lulled to sleep.  Thankfully, the movie ends quickly as soon as the pony shows his one trick.Along Came A Spider also contains my pet peeve, which is that it abuses technology to advance the plot.  The victims this time are once again computers and the internet, which the script abuses throughout the film - including the now classic I could explain the whole movie if I only knew this computer's password!  I would have been less insulted if the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock appeared and moved the story along.Monica Potter doesn't really get the job done as the female lead.  She's certainly pretty, but she's also as wooden as a mannequin.  I'm sure she has a bright career ahead of her starring in straight-to-Lifetime movies like She Walked Alone and Stranger With My Baby.  In fact, the only difference between Along Came A Spider and your standard Sunday on Lifetime is another great performance by Freeman, who is one of a few actors we can really count on.

I disagree, there aren't any more than are contained in most fictional works, and whatever ones may be in this film certainly are not distracting.  Near the end, there is what I call a miracle happens when Alex (Freeman) finds Jezzie's (Potter) computer, quickly guesses (Aces&Eights) her password, and with a few keystrokes reads and sees all the pieces fall into place to lead him directly to the kidnapped little girl. Only in fiction, only in a movie, can this happen. But I forgive them, it would have been unbearably tedious to actually see him discover all that in a believable way.The meat of the story is this deranged (a mind is a terrible thing...) teacher, in disguise, who wants to pull a Lindbergh-like kidnapping of the century of a Russian student of his. However, there is too much security so instead he kidnaps the best friend classmate, a young girl. The teacher then arranged to use the girl to contact via their secret email code the Russian boy, coax him outside his home so he could be snatched.  Problem was, two others were aware of the teacher's plot, and they double-crossed him to get $10Million worth of diamonds.  The security man had set up a webcam showing where the teacher lived, so he would get caught, as part of their plan to pretend to be the kidnapper and get the diamonds.  Jezzie was the main perpetrator of the double-cross, and our only clue is early when the disguised voice is asking for the diamonds, we see her eyes shift back and forth, telegraphing her involvement. I only noticed it upon re-playing the scene later. At this point in the film she was still Alex's partner.The crooks would have gotten away with it, had it not been for the omniscience of Alex, who managed to piece together several very tiny clues which convinced him the teacher was not the real villian, and which lead him to suspect Jezzie.  But, that's why he is so good! Without that, there wouldn't have been a movie in the first place. And, as a tribute to his toughness, he does not hesitate to put a big one through Jezzie's heart at the end, to save the little girl. After he had used a shotgun earlier to snuff out the teacher.Not a great movie, still I like it better than Kiss The Girls. None of the plot twists seem forced, once I reflect on the whole movie.

He could just as well have Dimitri called to his office instead of Megan - he would have pulled of his caper without the necessity to bring himself into danger once more at the Russian embassy...No, this movie was certainly not a memorable one. And Monica Potter as a bad girl? Come on, guys, who is going to buy this???

Otherwise the use and re-use of tired plot devices and general crime clich√©s is too much. And some of the acting is pretty marginal, too, making for rough sledding.The essence is a kidnapping with ransom in play, and with the common addition that the criminal wants a particular cop to do the case. (For prestige.) So Freeman takes the case. The actual crime is clever and highly improbable (the criminal needed to be in disguise for 2 years straight before the crime--2 years!). And then the series of twists begins, with people who are not suspects suddenly (very suddenly) in the middle of it all.Of course these things all have their interest, so even as you watch knowing it could be better you're curious who did what and how. It makes sense, too, whatever the unlikelihood. Expect scene after scene to depend on Freeman's steady hand to keep it afloat.Director Lee Tamahori has an up and down career, and he's no stranger to mediocre productions, and so this is right up his alley (The Devil's Double is the more interesting, and the most recent). The most praised by far is the one dealing with his own New Zealand issues, Once Were Warriors, so that might be a place to go instead of this. If you, like me, never mind a good Morgan Freeman detective movie (there are lots of them), then you might get along with this just fine--with expectations in line with reality.

In this way the movie is perfectly symmetrical; meaningless insights embedded in a pointless story. The plot has very few twists &#150; if by twists we mean the head remains connected, however tenuously, to the tail. A lot of strange stuff does happen (it's just not connected to anything that went before). My suspicion is that the writer got these ideas by throwing darts against the wall - and came up with the final surprise when one bounced off the board and hit him in the head. Monica Potter is absolutely lovely to watch, and Morgan Freeman is suitably grim. My guess is that the film made money, and so for the principals, was worth the week it took to film, and the ten minutes it took to write.

While the first film, Kiss The Girls, was a huge success, it's sequel, Along Came A Spider was a bust, once again due to the fact that the strengths of the character were not utilized properly. The character of Alex Cross was created by Author, James Patterson, and has been responsible for over 20 best selling novels, because he's unlike any other cop in any other mystery series. Cross is a psychologist first, who gets inside the heads of killers. Once he knows what they're thinking and why they're acting the way they are, Cross is usually able to capture them. These stories make for terrific novels, but when transferred to the screen, producers felt that they lack the action movie goers crave. Despite a successful first appearance on screen, the producers felt that with more action and bullets, the sequel would do even better, they were wrong. When a Senator's daughter is abducted from an upscale private school, detectives are at a loss, but call Cross in when evidence and a ransom demand turn up at his house. Cross believes the criminal is using his admiration to cover up the real motives for this crime, and he needs to play into that role, in order to determine what those motives are. This was a terrific novel, but wasn't right for the screen, so much of the story was cut and replaced by the manhunt and police chases. These elements make for a more intense film, but don't do justice to the story. Alex Cross and his abilities are the story and are what make the series unique. Morgan Freeman returned hesitantly to do the sequel and he was right when he said he shouldn't have done it, mainly because it takes away from the brilliance of the first film. The producers of this movie even managed to screw up a terrific surprise ending and that really says it all. Along Came A Spider is not a bad film, it certainly has it's movements and a legendary star, but if you're a fan of the Alex Cross novels, expect to be disappointed.

Alex Cross is introduced in an unnecessary opening sequence where he loses a partner. He leaves work for eight months resorting to alcohol. The Senator's daughter is kidnapped by a professor and her shoe is found in Cross's mailbox. He pairs with guilt-ridden Monica Potter who was in charge of the victim. Director Lee Tarahori allows information to surface. He previously made a much better film in The Edge. Effective plot turns hardly make up for the numerous shortcomings. Freeman is a great film presence but his opening here barely matters to the rest of the film. The only notable element is that he will only use violence as a last resort. Potter is also cardboard until the third act where she becomes more interesting. Michael Wincott plays the villain, which is hardly a surprise since he seems to be the top of the list for actors to play villains. Billy Burke also makes an appearance until he is killed off. Dylan Baker is another talent who has been better used in other films.

Wincott then practically invites his old adversary Freeman in on the hunt by sending an article of clothing that Boorem wore to Freeman's house.What seems to be a battle of wits between Freeman and Wincott at first is far from that. There are a couple of other players in this game and they just might be holding the winning hand.I really was impressed with how Freeman got into all aspects of Detective Alex Cross. This man is intelligent and compassionate and is not easily fooled. Those other players in the game think they've got Freeman bamboozled, but he's far from that.Along Came A Spider is an intelligent action thriller with major kudos going to Morgan Freeman for his portrayal of Alex Cross.

He's called back in on a special case, involving the kidnapping of a congressman's little daughter (a real smart cookie) at a collegiate school by a nutter (a fantastic Michael Wincott who has a brilliant facade one might say at the start) who really just wants notoriety than money, but there's a bigger picture here. Yeah, I did have issues with the unsatisfying motive of Wincott's, but there's other qualities in this film that make up for it, so all can be forgiven. Assisting Freeman is a young female agent (Monica Potter-No, it's not Julia Roberts) bed sitting the daughter at school, who fails in his task in protecting her, and feels much obliged to help. The twist in this film is a killer, one of the best, I've ever witnessed, the film's title baring a classic connotation to this aspect. There's much more activity in this film, than the prior, and it's more action paced. This is definitely for fans of Freeman's or as a bonus, for fans of Kiss The Girls.

Like the book, this is about detective Alex Cross investigating a child abduction. As much as I love Morgan Freeman he's not my choice for Alex Cross and he's miscast in this OK but totally average thriller. Looking at the film from an objective point of view, this is an OK film technically but when compared to the book, it lacks the depth, twists and thrills which made the book such a non stop nightmare. Morgan Freeman is less interesting than usual and miscast and the film is in general just forgettable. To be fair, you can't really expect much from the person who did Die Another Day and if you haven't read the book you'll likely find this watchable and moderately entertaining. It's got plenty of tense moments and is more patient and mature than some films of its kind. The visuals are decent as is the script (despite a multitude of plot holes) and the film never becomes unwatchable.The main problem is that it's so generic and wasteful of the source material. It goes down the road into clich√© town with great enthusiasm and never really hits a peak. It can be dull and it has quite a few implausible situations. The revelation of Jessie Flanagan as the antagonist made sense in the book, but it doesn't here. The film is also derivative of better things and doesn't add anything whatsoever to the detective genre. There is apparently another Morgan Freeman film, which adapts the slightly inferior but still good sequel Kiss The Girls. That is apparently even more unfaithful so I don't plan to watch it. How bearable you find the film pretty much depends on whether or not you've read the book. It lacks charisma or soul, but makes up for it since it has a certain sense of dread, tension and realism.

The film is traditional, nothing new here. It is quite enjoyable, but just doesn't stick. *SPOILERS* Like, when Cross is hacking into some computer, he notices something (convenietly) and clicks on something on the computer which just so happens to bring him into some handy-cam that leads him into the home of the kidnapper (even more conveniently). And then there are many more things wrong with this film, but I just don't want to bother going through them all.

(a mistake perhaps because the ending was re-shot, after a long delay, and the writers were confused.) The only other explanation would be that Cross, having just killed Jezzie, is suffering from some deep emotional regret, but if that is so Freeman's portrayal is short of the mark. A previous comment remarks on the distances and locations Cross must travel by Metro and on foot in DC, and notes mistakes. A glaring error is that Cross, even if he were an Olympic athlete, could not have achieved the effort. Also, a movie scenario of racing from public phone to public phone to get the next track to a goal is an old, well worn, Hollywood trick, and overworked (something like the obligatory high speed car chase, in movie after movie.)Kiss the Girls was true to the original book, and I really enjoyed it, even knowing the story from the beginning. From what I read in the reviews, Along Came the Spider does not follow the book, although I did not read the novel.

While his first appearance was in kind of fair thriller, this return is better and more attractive in my point of view. From the first time I rented (Along Came a Spider - 2001) on 27/1/2003 I fell in love with it. The elements are all high and solid. The bright cinematography, Jerry Goldsmith's music, and the fresh performance, certainly we have a case where nothing is glaringly wrong. I enjoyed it more than once for its good cinematic work. (Morgan Freeman) is more charismatic than ever, doing a share of action as well. (Monica Potter) is a treasure, being awfully pretty and talented in the same time, though got no work in Tinseltown !? (Maybe she refuses to appear naked for instance, I know that what Hollywood always asks nowadays !). (Michael Wincott) made one of his most remarkable roles to date, being on the edge between a disturbed criminal and a wronged genius; I believed his sane performance so much. Yet, the one that I savored the most was that director. (Lee Tamahori), who came from New Zealand few years earlier, made deservingly a discrete name. I adore his work utterly. He can lead such a fascinating action all the way, with an unusual professional technique. He got lovely aesthetic feel, can formulate the simplest details as stately, and most of all he doesn't show off. He's capable of recreating a plain thriller as something so cohesive, engaging, and memorable without factitious or hyper anything. In one word, he's the old-fashioned school at its best. I always recall the sequence in which Freeman was running all over the streets of Washington D.C, or surely the one with the two leads having a tough moment under the rain in front of the Russian embassy; this is a magical moment of cinema. No wonder that shortly after he'll be selected to make the next James Bond's movie (Die Another Day) which I consider as a big masterpiece for both Tamahori and Bond. Although, this is the 100 minutes type of ride, but there are some interesting points  the way this kidnapper was communicating with the police (smart riddles), the screenplay's twists, and the good dialog. Just try to remember another thrillers where you hear lines like we do what we are, they are few, very few. Since I was a kid I loved reading the suspenseful novels, respecting just the strong ones, so by loving this movie I do what I am indeed ! Name one bad thing about it ? Hmmm...well, maybe one discovering for some information near the end was too easy to a little bit fabricated extent, the movie's title which's identical with another TV thriller from the 1970s that I see as lower, and finally the way people look at it as a small flick !! while it's fine, with no CGI crap, and still good damn way to spend an afternoon. P.S  (Monica Potter) doesn't look anything like (Monica Potter) on the poster !

Freeman plays the part of Alex Cross, a renowned criminal profiler who is lured out of his depressive state to help the FBI track down a kidnapper.

The film seems to flow smoothly and whilst not a complicated plot, it will keep you watching right until the end. Definitely a film you can only watch once unless you have a really bad memory. Michael Wincott plays a very good mad man whilst Freeman is at his cool calm best. Not the best thriller by any means but well worth a watch.

This is film is not as good as Kiss the Girls, and is not as dark, but it does fill a spot and is decent viewing.The basic plot of the film is Alex Cross is called out of retirement after a Senator's young daughter is kidnapped from her school under the noses of the Secret Service. The kidnapper picks Cross to be the main negotiator because he is damaged he is suffering from grief and guilt after the death of his partner.The film is not the most well written, with some of the plot twists a bit unbelievable but it does offer some gems like general politics and the politics within the Secret Service, the kidnap itself (the first 30 minutes are the best) and the general psychology of the characters. There is some good acting, Morgan Freeman can never give a bad performance, even in bad film. I thought the young actress playing Megan Rose (the kidnap victim), Mika Boorem, was very good and has promise, but I felt that the filmmakers could have shown more and play up the impact of being kidnapped. Michael Wincott and Monica Potter also offered decent performances. Lee Tamahori, the director, was really just a gun-for-hire director, but he still did solid job. He wasn't terrible but not spectacular. This was his last decent film because he ended up directing Die Another Day, XXX2 State of the Union and NextDecent enough film if it is on television.

The clever, late-coming plot twist is a bit too mechanical but effectively unexpected, making this a satisfying prequel to the hit thriller Kiss the Girls--based on the first of James Patterson's Alex Cross detective novels--and a welcomed addition to a promising movie franchise. It's no better or worse than a good vintage episode of Peter Falk's Columbo, adhering closely to the mystery-thriller's time-honored traditions, but with Morgan Freeman settling comfortably into his role as seasoned sleuth Alex Cross, familiar formula is given fresh vitality. When a senator's daughter is kidnapped from her high-security private school, the kidnapper (nicely played by the underrated Michael Wincott) draws Cross into the case, knowing that the psychologist-detective's involvement will bring high-profile publicity. Cross partners with the Secret Service agent (Monica Potter) who botched her assignment, but wait... the movie's got a rabbit in its hat... and that rabbit has an ace up its sleeve... and director Lee Tamahori (who brought similar intensity to The Edge) handles the sleight-of-hand with slick precision, dispensing just enough information to keep the viewer off guard without resorting to cheap manipulation. Don't look for much depth of character here, but Along Came a Spider is well served by everyone involved. It's the movie equivalent of a bestseller you'd impulsively buy at the grocery-store checkout, and on those terms it succeeds.

Thus it has become increasingly difficult to create a fresh, new and invigorating cinematic experience for the audience in terms of the thriller genre. This applies to the kidnap thriller &#145;Along Came A Spider'. Despite its' plot filled with numerous twists and turns on the &#145;who-dunnit' aspect, the film fails to surpass its  common level of normality. Comparing this film to other films, it is in my opinion a fact that subject to all the  saturation of all the thrillers released yearly, a thriller should stand out and be recognized for its' originality. And thus not be categorized as just another thriller with a surprise ending. While this film contains many  elements contained in a conventional thriller, it does not surprise nor appease as a  thriller should stand on its' own. Lee Tamahori (The Edge. Mulholland Falls) directs Morgan Freeman as he returns to his role as Dr. Alex Cross; the same role he portrayed in &#145;Kiss The Girls'. Yet, these two films are two separate entities and bear no resemblance in terms of plot and characters. In this outing,  Dr. Cross is assigned to a case by the kidnapper himself when a Senator's daughter is kidnapped from a prestigious  school for the world's diplomats.Joining Freeman on his search is Monica Potter,  a Secret Service agent who failed the kidnapped child's parents while under her supervision and now must redeem herself and rescue the child. This piece is a simple and formulaic  that contains an artificial story that sets the tone as indeed a formulaic film with an opening sequence containing some bad CGI (computer generated imagery). The opening sequence displays a car skidding off the road and ending up in a dam in a truly horrible attempt at CGI. That being said, if I may dissect the direction of the film and analyze it properly - one may not. Tamahori does not break any new ground and in a nutshell, does nothing more and nothing less to extract the most from this mediocre film. So much more could have been done  with the style of the film, its' direction and  performances. Yet,  the film's biggest flaw lies in  the interplay; or lack of, between antagonist  and  protagonist. Tension is not built, motives are built then tossed out, resulting in a slew of characters that we as the audience really have not connected with. Sympathy nor hate is not accomplished thus building a  wall that prohibits us  from truly entering the film and  encompassing ourselves with the film's characters, dialogue, and suspense. In conclusion, many more different styles of filmmaking  could have been attempted with this film. yet it is clear that Tamahori was not attempting to break new ground with this film and chose merely to fill 1 Hr. and 40. mins. with a  simple, formulaic and medium paced film that will not surprise anyone with its' mediocrity.Giancarlo's Rating **  "},{"Title":"I could watch Morgan Freeman sleep and be entertained.","Date":"19 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  This movie doesn't get much past that.

(This review will not be a rant on how great independent films are; frankly many of those bore me.) First the good  Morgan Freeman, of course always turns in a good believable performance.  I'm not a huge fan, but I have a lot of respect for his work.  It's a well-directed film with a good slick look (except for a truly awful CGI car crash) and most of the cast is good as well, with Michael Wincott (who should be in more movies) giving us a creepy villain. Wincott's performance gave some real intensity to the film, and actually had me a little worried about what would happen to the little girl. Overall though, I guess only for those who haven't seen many kidnapping movies, this would prove a great entertainment.     Now the bad....Monica Potter was not very believable for me at all.  THough she's pretty nice to look at, she came off as pretty awkward.  Maybe she'll work her way up to something like this, but she's not quite there yet.

Cross goes into retirement. He is sharply brought out of this by a call from 'Mr Soneji' who has kidnapped a Senator's daughter. This has been done under the noses of the Secret Service agent who was assigned to protect her, Jezzie Flannigan.She teams up with Cross to try to get her back. The plot moves along crisply with Soneji playing games with Flannigan and Cross. This part of the movie works well.Unfortunately, the film unravels in the last reel. We discover that Flannigan and a fellow Secret Service agent were onto Soneji's plan and in fact, are manipulating the plot to extort money.The film then degenerates into standard Hollywood melodrama, with Flannigan killing her co-conspirator and becoming unhinged and trying to murder her former charge. It of course ends with a show down between Flannigan and Cross.This is a shame because until this point this film had been a good thriller. Despite this Freeman provides his usual class performance. Potter demonstrates that she has got what it takes to become a top flight actress with a well measured performance. Mika Boorem is yet another high class child actor who shows that she can act with the best of them in a thoroughly creditable performance.

My friends always want to go to the same types of movies. It's usually a dumb horror flick or a suspense film. Along Came A Spider seemed very similar to many of those, so I felt like I'd seen it before. I even drew a parallel to Rush Hour with Jackie Chan. The difference between this one and the others was the ending. I'm not going to talk about the ending to spoil it, but I am going to say that I thought it was a little overboard. Recent suspense movies have seemed to try to include so many twists, that they seem to be pushing it. Morgan Freeman was good. He always is. Although if he keeps playing roles like this, people may question his range of acting ability. Monica Potter wasn't very good. I remember seeing her in Patch Adams and not being impressed. When I remembered that I thought she was bad in Patch Adams, it didn't help her at all for me. Everyone else gave solid performances, nothing extraordinary though. However, with all those bad things I said, the movie was entertaining, and that's what movies are for. It's not going to be winning any awards, but it's worth seeing. Better than some of the other options out there right now, I'm sure. I gave it a 7 of 10.

Or at the very least a 'shock' of some sort. With out giving too much of the film away, I will say that the plot is original. As a whole this movie had a good concept behind it, and some great talent that could have made it an excellent film. But it just doesn't happen. Watching the film it felt like it kept losing track with too many sub plots. But it then makes several hasty attempts to get back on track.Morgan Freeman does a great job here as the weathered, yet focused hero of the film. One of only a few actors who can show an intellectual side without giving the appearance that he's acting. Monica Potter does an excellent job as well! She doesn't just recite her lines in the movie. She goes through the movements as well. Her facial expressions and body language make her more of a real person in this film, and not just a character. Michael Wincott appears as the scheming, but patient villain of the film. A great job by a good actor. You get the feeling that he could snap at any moment, which makes him all the more menacing. SPOILER ALERT But then there's the plot. In many spots in the storyline becomes way too vague about the subjects at hand (clues for tracking down the bad guy, motives for the crimes, technical talk, etc...). But what becomes worse are the holes in the plot. There are way too many items in this movie that are just left to random chance, and others that just leave you scratching your head (exactly why did he call Alex Cross, how did he find a feed from a web cam in the guy's house, how could he guess the password correct on the first try, how does a scared little girl suddenly have the judgement and logic of an adult in less then 1 shot, etc...).Overall I would recommend anyone see this movie if either they're a fan of one of the film's stars, they want to see an original story line, or they want to see some really great acting. Other then that, I'd just wait until it comes out on video.  "},{"Title":"Good Plot.

Every movement is purposeful.I find that, however, Monica Potter is unacceptable as an actress, for she is simply without ANY expressions. In one of the scenes (Not really a spoiler since no plot information is included) which she follows Freeman up a staircase, she looked more like a child following her parent rather than a partner at work. The character Megan was well done. I believe that a child does not necessary go into hysteria when an extreme circumstance descends upon her. As an intelligent child, she looked for ways out, and take the things that come with bravery. The plot was fairly predictable, but not completely. The script was well-written, and the pace was quick, not too fast, but never slowed down. Overall, a great experience.********************************************************************* *******************Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!************************* *********************************************************************I can be wrong about this. When Freeman was being led by the kidnapper all over DC, the kidnapper told him to go to Platform A in Union Station of Washington DC. The next scene, to my absolute surprise, is the Johns Hopkins Hospital Station in Baltimore!!! I know this because of the following1. All stations (that I have been to) in DC, at the edge of the platform, have circular lights which signify the coming of a train. The edge of the station in the movie is yellow, which I know for sure is in the Baltimore subway (I rode it everyday for a year)2. DC stations are usually much wider, have a dome interior, with different style of benches.3. The walls are white, and the only station where the walls are white in Baltimore is the Johns Hopkins Hospital Station.4. The scene when the train exits the tunnel into the surface was recognizable as being in Baltimore, so is the drop off itself being on the path to the Owings Mills station. The highway which the train traveled is I-795. I am not saying that this makes the movie poor in quality.

The first is a fairly accomplished performance from Morgan Freeman who seems incapable of giving a poor performance and leaves the questioned being asked as to where has he been all his life.

It really does make you grateful for your money, but the fact that this scene makes you pleased is enough reason to justify your complaint at its obvious downfalls.A director like Tamahori is more than capable of delivering drama of the highest quality, but the one thing lacking in this thriller is the drama. There is absolutely none at all. The plot is very half-baked and only has enough momentum to carry half the movie. Perhaps this where the drama needs to happen. After all there are enough actors there to give us some drama, but instead the writer has opted out and decided throw us into Hitchcock territory. That just about p***es the audience off, we were clever enough to get up to this point without being lost so why on earth should we tred back over muddy ground.There are three or four twists thrown in which are not exactly surprising and leave you turning over to your girlfriend and saying I knew that would happen. We are left in the mind of the write rather than the viewer which soon becomes frustrating.Perhaps every idea in movies has been dreamed up so that now we have become a cinema savvy audience and can see the mysteries before they are. If that is the case then is very unfortunate. Plot holes, poor direction and characterless characters leave this one as a real disappointment.

Meanwhile, McGuiverette, the senator's daughter, apparently knows that by placing the intercom battery on the already lit stove (you'd think that kidnappers don't serve much tea) and then awaits it's 10 megaton blast before she flees.  Why even bother sending the police to find this girl...she can free herself.  Ok, now the kidnapper coaxes Dimitri to leave his room (very good security in his house considering what has just happened) by pretending to be the kidnapped girl.  Kids know how to pass notes to each other via online pictures, but aren't smart enough to know that kidnapped people don't have computers to play on, nor do they need to keep up their method of passing notes via the pictures (they aren't in class).  So, they thwart the kidnapper's attempt on young Dimitri (his last scene) and now we find the kidnapper's kidnapped has been kidnapped (why he doesn't report this to the police we'll never know).  So, the kidnapper, apparently has no clue what is going on finds Morgan.  Morgan, the sly fox that he is, tricks Mr. kidnapper and claims that instead of 10 million in diamonds, it was 12 million.  Obviously thrown for a loop with the glaring mistake in the value of the diamonds, the kidnapper ignores him completely.  I mean, everyone knows the difference in 10 mil and 12 mil in diamonds...man, Morgan is a GENIUS!!!  So, he kills the kidnapper for being such an idiot with the musket which is still conveniently lying on the kitchen table with pieces of fruit loops stuck to it.  Now we find out that pretty little miss secret service agent is a bad egg.  (Great, more twists)  Now it is Morgan's turn to figure it out...and it takes all of 12 seconds...I mean, it is obvious...anyone who's father wins a musket in a game of aces&eights has to be a criminal (how she got into the secret service with that background is anyone's guess)...it was just staring him in the face.  So, knowing the password to her computer is just the first step.  One shot, with the ampersand too and no asterisks to confuse the audience...he gets in.  How convenient...he searches around...finds some pictures she has for online dating, her taxes...wait, a folder labeled wrong-doings...voila, this must be it.  So, Morgan is on his way to save the day.  No need, Mcguiverette (who is really the daughter of Jerel, superman reference) has lifted the cast iron bed in place so mean secret service lady can't get in.  She then makes a pipe bomb out of toilet paper, saliva and a dead spider and escapes. Morgan happens to catch her (which makes me believe he should have been the kidnapper to begin with) and kills the pretty blonde (maybe diamonds aren't a girl's best friend).  After questioning her personal guard for 3 years to why she was alone to save her, and been kidnapped and kidnapped again...it seems as little McGuiverette drops her guard and goes with the guy she had never met before because he says he'll take her back to her parents.  Ahh...such a good movie.

The opening of the film is very implausible, and left a sour taste that took a long time to go away.  Once the main story is well underway, though -- the kidnapping of a U.S. Senator's child by mastermind Gary Soneji -- things get moving along at a tight, crisp pace . . . until about fifteen minutes to go, when a gratuitous Keyser Soze-esque ending gets tacked on for no good reason.  (To be fair, the ending is similar to the book ending as well -- both leave you scratching your head).Morgan Freeman is exceptionally good, except for the fact that he's a little too old for the Alex Cross role -- Cross, in the novels, is supposed to be a much younger man.  Still, that's a casting flaw, certainly not Freeman's fault, and Freeman makes the most out of a good part.  Monica Potter is excellent as Special Agent Jessie Flanagan as well.  Their performances really make the movie, and they're able to pull off some awfully cliched lines with enough style to make them actually sound good.  Same script with different actors . . . Along Came a Spider might've been a clunker.Overall, very good.  Could've been a great film with a slightly different ending (and a completely different beginning), but still manages to entertain.

Monica Potter showcases neither the depth, nor the charisma that Ashley Judd did in its predecesor. The villians whoms names i willnot reveal here do not rival that of Tony Goldwyn, nor Cary Elwes. Megan Rose is played well for a young actor, but the part was written far too unbelievably. I began to wonder if she was the daughter of James Bond at certain points in this picture.  The scenario that goes down in the last 15 minutes is so far-fethced that i found myself yearning for Starship Trooperish realism.To the movie's credit, aside from the lack of realism, the first 3/4ths of the movie was at least able to hold my attention, but the ending was so bizarre and unexplained that i wished i hadn't bothered with the rest.The best i can give it is a 3 out of 10.

When I first saw her and realized she was going to be a big part of the plot, I thought oh, man, not another poor cute kid story.  But she ended up being the star and the hero of the story to me.  She wasn't so tough that she was unbelievable - she was smart and gutsy but also scared half to death.One thing I really liked about the movie was the complete lack of sexual tension between the main male and female characters.  In most hollywood movies, you have a man and a woman standing in the same room for ten seconds and BINGO - doesn't matter how much older than her the man is, how completely incompatible they are, who is married or anything else - they want each other.  Not so in Along Came a Spider.  Unfortunately, while that made the movie more enjoyable and realistic for me, I have no doubt that the reason for the lack of sexual tension is very clear - it's because Morgan Freeman is a black man.  Guaranteed, had he been a white man, there would have at least been some goo-goo eyes made at some point.  The thirty-plus year age difference probably wouldn't have mattered.  But anyway, despite the racism I suspect was responsible for the choice, I found it refreshing to have no romance entering the story.If you can relax your mind and accept the leaps of logic in the plot, you might find this an interesting movie.

But from the poorly executed opening sequence to the incredibly lucky password guess, this movie plot had more holes that an Alpine Lace swiss cheese.Don't get me wrong.  I didn't hate the movie.  That cutie Michael Wincott was worth the price of admission alone (I've been following his career for many years, and am glad to see him starting to move closer to leading roles).  He just didn't have enough scenes to make it as good as it could have been.If the director (or perhaps it was the screenwriter) had simply left out that dreadfully poor opening car crash sequence (I mean, folks, I've seen better special effects in student films), they could have had a few more minutes to give the characters the development they deserved.  Each and every one was woefully underdone.  I mean rare.  I've never read Mr. Patterson's book, but I'd be willing to bet he put a lot more effort into developing these characters that this director/screenwriter did.Even the great Morgan Freeman couldn't make me believe that Alex Cross could guess a password gleaned from a conversation he'd had hours earlier, much less get the spelling of the phrase right with his first try.  I mean, wouldn't any normal person have written out and instead of using the ampersand the first time around?  A few more seconds to at least let him try unsuccessfully a couple of times wouldn't have hurt.I did appreciate the ending plot twist.  It was the only thing about the film I didn't see coming a mile away.  But why did she do it?  The money? And speaking of the ransom, how is it they could get $10 million in diamonds for a nobody senator's kid?  Also, did she and her partner stake out Soneji for two years just on the hopes he'd do something nutty like kidnap a couple of kids from the school?  Or were they in cahoots with him all along?  I'd be willing to bet on the former, but I wish I could understand why.  What was her motive? And why did they even take the kid from Soneji when they could have simply collected the ransom and sat quietly until she could kill him off in a shoot-out?  End of story.  They didn't want to return the kid anyway, and could have just left her wherever.Please, who says a movie has to be two hours or less?

SPOILER ALERT `Along Came a Spider' is another one of those James Patterson film adaptations that involves a senators daughter being kidnapped, and Alex Cross being called out of his slump to solve the case. The term cat and mouse will invariable come up in this review, I hated that term. I gave `Kiss the Girls' a C+, but after seeing `Along Came a Spider,' I appreciate that stories atmosphere and semi plausible storyline to the comic book logic in Along Came a Spider. Morgan Freeman who was good in both Alex Cross detective films, the man still needs a workable script, with an ounce of edginess,  intrigue and or plausibility to make this series work. Monica Potter (the wife from `Con Air') plays Cross' new partner, who's a neophyte secret service agent tagging along with Cross to learn the tricks of the trade. I liked Potter as his partner, she fits well into the lame storyline and has a cute naivet√©, although I can't imagine how she's going to learn to be a physic detective. Every time Freeman sits down and looks at a computer screen, he manages to inexplicably find a clue within seconds. I guess it's the eyes. There's a scene that involves yet another showdown between Alex Cross and the criminal mastermind of this elaborate kidnapping, who's more into playing that cat and mouse game with Cross than getting the ransom. What's with serial killers these days? Ever since `Se7en' they all want to play fricken games like they're the Joker in Gothaem city. The heavy in `Along Came a Spider' is so obtuse that he puts on a fake face (A la `Mission Impossible') for two whole years, then he becomes a great teacher that just happens to get his mark in his class. And all of this so he simply kidnap the senators girl, just to call Alex Cross up on the phone so he can be his adversary. And all of that work was just to get to the Russian Presidents child who is a totally different kid than the one he has. I'm scratching my head, but I'm not making this crap up. What's going on here, did anyone read this script, or was everybody too eager to make a sequel (or prequel) to the successful `Kiss the Girls?' Get the money, then play games you dumb s***. Where was I? Oh yea, the standoff. The hero and villain are face to face and the Joker says `That's transparent and clumsy' to Cross, referring to his fairly obvious deductions regarding the where about of the senators missing daughter. Yup, that about sums up my feelings regarding `Along Came a Spider,' careless and clumsy, but its got Morgan so its not a total loss. Oh, by the way, the killer is so obsessed with playing some sort of homoerotic mind game with Cross, that this little kidnapped girl dupes him through acting like a Spy Kid, and throwing a battery into his teapot, which in turn causes one of these lavish movie fires.Character actors Jay o Sanders,(in a cameo)and Dylan Baker fill in the casting gaps with their consistency reliable performances. In fact, the movies only real distinction is the character arc of Carl Monroe played by that guy from `Happiness.' Dylan Baker luckily is in every other movie these days, finally the industry has taken notice of this man. Maybe Nicky Katt will be next. There's a general consensus in cop movies, that there always be that one guy who is totally clueless and his this austere approach to debunk the protagonist mission even though there both on the same side. I call it the Sergeant Dwayne T, Robinson factor, named after that cop in `Die Hard' who ALWAYS managed to condescend Al Powell by barking orders like; If there's terrorists in there, where's their list of demands? All we know is that whoever shot your car up is probably the same silly sonofabitch you've been talking to on that radio, even though it was painfully obvious that Bruce Willis was the good guy. `Along Came a Spider' starts with Dylan Baker being that prick of a cop by insulting Cross. Then, a few minutes later a miracle happens, the guy actually apologizes to Cross for being such an asshole, and they become friends the rest of the movie. Ha, great, wonderful, than you director Lee Tamhori for surprising me, once.

There was an attempt at sheer novelty and surprise which is what it came across as.  However, the movie was worth the time and entertaining as movie go.  I would recommend it to others.

Sure, there were a couple twists in the plot...but a twist means nothing if the story and characters aren't very interesting in the first place.  I think this movie needed a more creative plot that's never been done in these types of movies (kidnapping a government official's child is a bit too cleche) and more interesting characters (the villain seemed like an average man, not nearly as interesting as Anthony Hopkins in 'The Silence of the Lambs' or Kevin Spacey in 'Se7en').

It really doesn't after the main 'twist' is revealed the rest of the movie is more than predictable. It fits in nicely with Hollywood's religion the androgynization of society. In excess, in fact. Way in excess.Morgan Freeman is excellent as usual, though the movie is not on a caliber with 'Kiss The Girls'. Monica Potter is a promising actress but unfortunately I think this role will come to haunt her; it will stereotype her in the public mind for years to come. In the film her character change, which I won't give away, is simply not believable because the writers' desire to 'surprise' us leads them to give us no hints and thus her character comes off as secondary to their big twist--her character development is thus totally lacking.In the name of 'shattering gender stereotypes', her character is shown doing something at the end of the film that you know that NO male character would EVER be allowed to do. For my part I'm sad to say I will never be able to see Potter in any other role again without thinking of this scene, and it's not because of any outstanding acting on her part.

He also penned creepy, Kiss The Girls, which was adapted for film and also starred Morgan Freeman.Morgan Freeman is such a calm guy. He's has a Steven Seagal serenity about him. It works in this type of fast twisting, elaborately technical dialog flick. He helps keep your brain relaxed and focused while absorbing tiny bits of information that will later compute into an intricate unique plot.ACAS story goes...Teacher, Mr. Sanje, has a plan. A sinister plan. He's a copycat of the worst kind. He wants infamy through others' misery. He kidnaps a young student and leaves a clever clue . Sanje invites retired cop and profiler/author Alex Cross to spar a bit.Sanje wants the public to notice him. Give him notoriety. To be sure he's properly portrayed as a forensic whiz psycho and not, God forbid, just a plain old psychoCross reluctantly obliges and the hunt is on. But just who is hunting who?Can Cross lead the arsenal of FBI and Police agents to the clever shanghaier before the girl dies? Is the girl even the story? Hmm.If your a die-hard mystery fan you may start to see the fly through the web half way through.

She held her own gracefully and captivatingly with her elders. Again kudos to both novelist and screenplay writer for her words spoken as if from a real child in a real situation.Secret Service agent Jezzie, played by Monica Potter, was annoying.

Sometimes I wonder what the MPAA considers when handing out their ratings because there really wasn't anything in Along Came a Spider that I would consider R material... OK, maybe cold blooded murder and innocent bystanders getting gunned down every once in a while... but the complete lack of suspense just made those moments seem gratuitous. That or I don't find gunshots to the head to be shocking anymore (until I witness one in real life).

Freeman is definitely a class act, in any role he gives just what is needed, and this is no exception. His rendering of Dr Cross is highly cynical and equally clinical as he tries to profile the kidnapper in order to save the child. Monica Potter is also on good form as the disgraced Secret Service agent trying to regain her standing with her colleagues after Soneji escaped from her so simply. But Michael Wincott has very difficult role here at times clinically disposing of people who get in his way, but also trying to be reassuring to his captive who he doesn't seem to want to hurt.

But so much of the plot defies credibility that you really have to accept a lot of implausible events to begin to enjoy the tale. The opening scene, though, is a good one and has a way of hooking you into the story very effectively.MORGAN FREEMAN is quietly authoritative as a man who seems to have no trouble cracking cases, especially those involving complicated technologies like computers. He merely has to sit in front of one to immediately detect the probable password and the various wiz techniques underneath photos where encrypted messages lie waiting for his detection with a flick of his finger over the keyboard. Highly unlikely that a man of his age would be this computer savvy in the first place--which is probably why, in the original novel, the man was a much younger detective.MONICA POTTER makes a pretty helpmate but goes through her role in a rather expressionless way, as though afraid to give too much away if she changed her fixed stare.Most impressive among the supporting players is MICHAEL WINCOTT as the sinister mastermind of a kidnapping, who gets his kicks by taunting the lead detective on the case with improbable phone calls detailing how the detective must comply with innumerable directions if he wants the kidnapper to release the girl, who is the daughter of a wealthy senator and his wife. His explicit directions are just too complex and readily followed by Freeman in a manner that defies any common sense or credibility.But if you swallow these improbabilities, the story is a swift moving one under Lee Tomahori's direction. Never clear are anyone's motivations, another flaw in an otherwise fairly engaging detective yarn that passes the time.

It feels like it all has been done a couple of times before in so many other thrillers. The many obvious twists, the characters that you'll find in almost any thriller,... it really doesn't give you the feeling that you have been watching something special. But what bothered me most was perhaps the story on itself. Of course the little girl is a brilliant student with some famous and rich parents. And of course there can be no doubt about the fact that she is a lot smarter than this 'average' criminal who has kidnapped her and who is holding her captive... And yet, this isn't the worst movie in the genre. Mainly thanks to the performances of Morgan Freeman and Monica Potter, this movie is above average, without being great or even really good. If you don't mind watching an unoriginal thriller or when you are interested in every movie Morgan Freeman has ever played in, than you should give it a try, otherwise you better stay with movies like Se7en.

At the beginning of Along Came a Spider, he is suffering over guilt due to a mistake he made in the past that led to the death of his partner. When a political figure's daughter is kidnapped from her school, he feels that it is up to him to solve the case, and find the girl alive.  He partners up with a woman who seems to have been a close friend of the girl's.  The movie is actually quite interesting, and we understand the dilemmas Cross must face, yet instead of winding itself out into a conclusion, it seems the writer felt the need to make this movie different (or not so different since it seems to be the latest thing in Hollywood to add a twist at the end), and we are hit with an unexpected, and not really welcome, climatic scene. It may have worked though, if Cross hadn't simply pulled the answer out of thin air.  It makes this movie a prime example of deus ex machina, which I consider the easy way out, especially if the whole movie depends on this solution, and nothing else.  Which is probably why they needed the twist.  Not to mention the uncomfortable feeling you are left with  since the ending came about due to pure chance.  Though this movie does make you think twice about...stuff.  I don't want to give anything away.  I give this a 5 out of 10.

Along Came A Spider is a very entertaining thriller, but as soon as it ends, you realize that it is little more than a rehash of things that have been seen in countless thrillers of the same kind before. There are several effective twists during the movie, but when you think about it, they are exactly the same twists that you see in just about every thriller. The largely recycled plot is somewhat saved by the always excellent performance from Morgan Freeman (I think he's more than redeemed himself by now for Hard Rain), as well as the wonderfully hate-able kidnapper (Gary Soneji) provided by Michael Wincott, who may not have been given a role as fitting as this since Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (keeping in mind his excellent performance in The Crow). Monica Potter plays the role of the Secret Service agent in charge of supervising little Megan, the daughter of a Senator and the subject of the story's kidnapping. It doesn't become abundantly clear until near the end of the film, but Potter sounds EXACTLY like Julia Roberts in this role, despite bearing no physical resemblance whatsoever. Her vocal similarity to Roberts is downright spooky.One of the things that really brought this movie down was the way that Megan was portrayed as some sort of super girl. I don't expect for her to be just a poor helpless little girl, but just because she is a senator's daughter doesn't mean that she should automatically be able to concoct a brilliant scheme involving exploding batteries in order to escape from her captor, or perform some of the feats that she did while she was held captive in the wooden room during the end of the film. That sort of thing should be reserved for action B-movies like Commando (yes, I know that Commando rocked, but so did Bloodsport and Kickboxer, but that doesn't mean they're not B-movies). You remember that Alyssa Milano, in Commando, was confined to a wooden room in that film, and she escaped by prying a board loose near the floor &#150; EXACTLY the same way that Megan was attempting to escape in Along Came A Spider. Given all of the things that are wrong with this film, it becomes clear that it's value does not lie with the story, but instead with the superior performances throughout. Of particular note, obviously, are Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Freeman is always good in his movies, however bad the plot, and it's just so good to occasionally see an actor like Wincott get a role that fits his iconography so well. Along Came A Spider is not a great movie by any standards, but there can be no denying that it does have its moments. The delivery of the diamond ransom, for example, may not have been too original, but at least it was well done. While it's true that this movie seems to have been assembled from parts taken directly from dozens of other movies, it still manages to barely save itself, although it is still almost sure to be very quickly forgotten.

So, the question is what makes for a successful adaptation? If you are in search of an answer to this question, the answer won't be found with Along Came a Spider since I believe it's the worst adaptation of a novel I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing.The method for this adaptation seemed to be to take the well-developed plot, with three-dimensional characters and one of the most interesting and complex criminals I've seen in the genre and gut it down to its very core. What remains is the basic premise of the plot along with the twist, but with all the details and development removed it becomes totally ridiculous. Characters are completely undeveloped and are barely two dimensional. The worst hit is the Gary Soneji character (portrayed rather weakly by Michael Wincott), who instead of being complex becomes a mere cardboard cutout of a psychopath. The basic plot is barely functional and to me was nothing more than a series of events happening one after the other with the movie progressing from one event to the next without any real structure. What this all amounts to is another dire Hollywood thriller that one could confuse for any typically bland made-for-TV movie, if it was not for the name actors involved. Morgan Freeman does the best he possibly can with the material and really is the only reason to watch the movie. I'm not sold on Monica Potter's acting ability, but to be fair her character is as undeveloped as that of the Soneji character.To sum up, Along Came a Spider is the worst movie I've seen at the cinema this year, and as such I cannot recommend it to anyone.

Soon, Cross and Flannigan come to the terrible realization that this crime only represents the tip of the iceberg for the ruthless Soneji.Director Lee Tamahori and screenwriter Marc Moss treat their star with all due respect, and manage to turn out an engrossing, entertaining movie in the process.But still,it isn't a smart thriller like Se7en or Copycat.Instead, it's more of a watchable idiotic thriller.

The story concerns a profiler doctor/writer(Morgan Freeman) losing his partner in a wonderfully shot opening scene being brought into the abduction of a senator's daughter. What follows is a roller-coaster of twists and turns, lots of action, and some good solid acting. Technological advances, psychological profiling, even a bit of international importance are weaved throughout a very taut and tight thriller directed under the capable hands of Lee Tamahori. Freeman gives a wonderfully skilled performance as he is always like to do. He puts pieces together cognitively amidst a sea of clues and red herrings. Monica Potter plays his new partner(and she is lovely to boot)and gives a very nice turn in her somewhat complicated role. The end of the film, for me, was a complete surprise, and I found myself enjoying every minute of this fast-paced film. This is the kind of entertainment thats deserved of such an appellation. While not a great film, Along Came a Spider is an exciting, good film. Watch for Michael Moriarity and Penelope Anne Miller as the parents of the kidnapped child. Nice to see them in film every now and then.

And it works not because of the kidnapping of the child. Not because of the pathos that comes along with such a case all the time, every time. Not because of the failed attempt of the girl to escape. Not because of the child's father's over-reacting. It works because the plot is too simple to be accepted like that. A solitary man could not have planned and realized that plot in Washington DC, with the Russian security services looking after the son of the Ambassador and the secret service working there full time in that private school. Too much security in that school for such a kidnapping to have been done by only one person. Then there must have been accomplices and that's how the film works because we do not know who he or she or they is or are and we are looking out for the clues, for the punch line, for the final and supreme plotter. And that's just what it is all about, one plotter double-crossing the other or the others, or even maybe three tiers instead of just two, and maybe even four tiers, and we are double-crossed in a magnificent way just the very same way the profiling cop is double-crossed in a very standard way. The profiler is profiled by the criminal and then side-tracked because when you know the profile of the profiler the profiler becomes predictable and then inefficient, impotent. So that helps to take the medicine down indeed, even if the girl survives only because the criminals did not do one thing right, only one thing, one single and unique thing. It only takes one mistake for the best adventures to fail.

Con-Air's Monica Potter, Crow nemesis Michael Wincott, and Penelope Ann Miller co-star with Freeman.Unfortunately, this above-average, old-fashioned, but preposterous murder-mystery thriller grabs you by the jugular at the outset with a terrific wreck, then gradually looses its grip and becomes an anticlimactic, standard-issue, cat & mouse, ransom potboiler. Happily, director Lee Tamahori never lets the narrative elements encumber the action. The sound transitions jump out at you, while scenarist Marc Moss triggers one surprise after another in whiplash succession to keep you guessing until our protagonist discovers the last thing that even he had expected. Altogether, Spider qualifies as a solid, respectable, entertaining, middle-of-the-road Agatha Christie thriller with no nudity but a body count. The hero is virtuous, and the villains are the spawn of evil. Older, more mature audiences will appreciate this psychological police story.Freeman reprises his Kiss the Girls role as Washington, D.C. Detective Dr. Alex Cross, a famous forensic psychiatrist with several books to his credit. When Cross's undercover partner dies in a botched field operation, he cannot forgive himself and retires. No sooner has Cross put himself out to pasture than he finds himself drawn into a kidnapping by the kidnapper! Apparently, elite public school teacher Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) has strangled a teacher and abducted a U.S. Senator's daughter. As Cross watches the TV news coverage about the crime, Soneji rings him up and notifies him about the evidence he stashed in Cross's mail box. Cross finds a shoe that belonged to Megan Rose Dunne (Mika Boorem of The Patriot) and joins the investigation. Disgraced Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), who supervised the around-the-clock surveillance on Megan, blames herself for Megan's abduction. Although the Feds want nothing to do with her, Cross teams up with Flannigan to track down the elusive Soneji. The trigger-happy Soneji wants Cross on the case so that he can document Soneji's crime of the century in a book and compare it with the tragic Lindbergh baby abduction..As kidnap capers go, Spider assembles all the standard conventions. Indeed, when the authorities trace Soneji's phone call, he gets off the line just before they can locate him. Later, when the villain issues his random demand, he sends Detective Cross hustling across the nation's capital on foot, answering various phones in multiple locations to see if our hero is acting alone without back-up. Naturally, Cross has Flannigan following him in a nearby car with an earpiece serving as a two-way radio while he scrambles from one phone booth to the next. Anybody that saw either Don Siegel's Dirty Harry or Ron Howard's Ransom knows this old trick.This time around the bad guy demands $10-million in untraceable diamonds. Clearly, Tamahori and Moss borrow the stunt of having Cross pitch a thermos of diamonds from a moving commuter train to the criminal, similar to what happened in Akira Kurosawa's 1962 Japanese kidnap caper High and Low. Along the way, our heroes learn Soneji has more in mind than simply kidnapping the daughter of a little-known Congressman and extorting millions from him.During the last twenty minutes of Spider, the revelations fly as thick as the gunfire punctuating them. Predictably, the FBI is nowhere in sight when Cross cracks the case and rescue Megan. James Patterson's novel provided the source for the film. Although the author's Kiss the Girls showed up a the first cinematic Cross mystery, Spider itself actually appeared in print before Girls. Tamahori and Moss toe the line on violence.You see several people getting shot, and you see brief spurts of blood erupt from their clothing, but the filmmakers never linger on those gory images. Similarly, apart from some harrowing moments involving Soneji's handling of Megan, Tamahori and Moss display great restraint and shun any urge to introduce perverted sexual elements.Alas, Spider is in a sense anticlimactic because nothing occurs after the tragic opening car crash scene that matches it in terms of action so the filmmakers work overtime in twisting and turning the plot until it resembles a pretzel. Younger audiences may find Along Comes a Spider bland and less than compelling, but traditional whodunit fans will appreciate both its red herrings and surprises, even if this well-made nail-biter breaks no new ground.

The plot is somewhat entertaining and has a few decent twists, but it is all basically rehashed material. While it has a twist that is somewhat interesting and not entirely predictable, it nevertheless all gives one the feeling that one has seen it all before somewhere and the entire movie feels tired and overall quite dull.As others have pointed out, the best aspects of this movie are some of the performances. Morgan Freeman is, as usual, excellent, proving like some other actors that he can still turn in a really good performance even when given a bad script and stuck in a world of blandness. The same is true of Michael Wincott who is also great as usual. He is so good at playing villains or just sinister people that it really is a shame that he is not in more good movies. Monica Potter also did a good job, particularly at giving off a kind of intangible unpleasant quality that rather subtly, and not obviously, made one want to dislike her, giving further satisfaction as the film progressed.Otherwise, this was a dull, tired film that while not really bad, and probably worth watching for free, is not one I would spend money on.

No, Along Came a Spider can be bashed on it's own merits. It's very apparent that the movie has been compressed in a hacked manner from a source with much more depth. Everything seems rushed, pieces fall together way too quickly and worst of all the movie has no depth.For example, at one point detective Cross is trying to guess a computer password, and after thinking for 30 seconds, he guess it on the first try. For a detective Mr. Cross doesn't seem to ask too many questions or look at too much evidence, but he doesn't have to because he is always right the first time.This lack of depth is also in the characters themselves. Cross could be an interesting character, if the audience could connect with him. Unfortunately we are never given the chance. We are told he feels guilty for the death of his previous parter, but we never see it. In fact if you remove one scene (the one were his wife says you shouldn't feel guilty of the death of (your partner).) then I wouldn't even suspect he had these feelings for the rest of the movie. In fact, there are almost no scenes, or even lines in this movie that breath life into a character. All the fat has been trimmed, so each line has a direct purpose. Which makes each character a cardboard cutout.You may notice that many of the reviews here are impressed by the surprise plot twists. The reason they are, I suppose, is because none of them are foreshadowed at all. Your average Scoobie-doo cartoon does a better job of foreshadowing than this movie.  Also the twists are completely illogical. Not that logic is found elsewhere in the movie, but hey, it's only a detective film. Who needs logic for that? I don't actually know how Detective Cross figures out the final twist, because we never see him make the connection. Instead the audience is shown the truth, then we cut back to him and he has already figured it out and is gathering evidence to verify it. But hey, he is the perfect detective, so it's no surprise.

I watch eagerly. I am instantly unimpressed. I go on, and a half hour into the film I start to think, What an average thriller. But then something wonderful happens. Something I didn't expect.And now I like this movie.The film stars Morgan Freeman, reprising his role of Alex Cross from Kiss the Girls. In the beginning of the film we are shown a stake-out-type police act go terribly wrong, ending in Cross' partner dying. Eight months later he is summoned to another case that involves a senator's daughter being kidnapped by a disguised schoolteacher. The woman that was supposed to watch the girl, Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Julia Roberts-lookalike Potter), volunteers to help Cross find the kidnapper, and so the game is on.Perhaps the best thing about this thriller is that I didn't expect any twists in the plot. That's why I was so unimpressed in the beginning. I enjoyed this movie about ten times more than most people, probably just because I didn't expect any surprise plot bits. I really didn't.The trailer made it look like an average flick. But this is good, because I didn't expect any plot twists. I remember watching a commercial for The Others with Nicole Kidman. On the advert they quote a critic, saying, With a surprise twist that will leave you breathless. This really lowered the enjoyablity of The Others, because I knew there was a plot twist, and it ruined it. The whole time I kept thinking, What's the twist? What's the twist? And guess what? I guessed it half way through.But that is not the case with Along Came a Spider. Though it is not a great thriller by any means, I really, truly was surprised by the ending and that's why I think commercials for films should not give away plot twists, even if they just mention there's a twist in the film. (Although the purpose of a review is to read about the film, the reader has the choice not to read; on TV, they flash the commercial with quotes at you before you can change the channel.)I have to agree that Monica Potter looks very much like Julia Roberts, the only difference being she can act about ten times better than Roberts. Well, at least two times better.Morgan Freeman redeems himself after Chain Reaction, and serves up a good -- if watered down -- performance.The only thing I thought that SHOULD have been better compared to could have been better is the car accident in the beginning. It looked like a computer game processor had served up the scene. The car looked very unrealistic and cartoonish. But other than that there were only a few flaws worth REALLY picking on.All in all, in the end, overall (my favorite closing lines), Along Came a Spider is in no way a great thriller, but an enjoyable one, with a surprise twist not revealed to me on the commercial (thank goodness). Worth catching some time when it crosses your way.3/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"A MYSTERY THRILLER WANT TO BE","Date":"28 January 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  The basic set up for this story is that the Alex Cross detective character is to match wits over the kidnaping of a senator's daughter with the kidnapper who insures that he is brought into the case.  Morgan Freeman goes through his acting paces and makes the questionable mystery story adequately entertaining.  The movie allows the viewer to be misled into thinking what the story line is all about, it at first seems predictable and not special. However, things start to change and the real plot and mystery unfolds. The only problem is that the realization about the true criminal situation facing Alex Cross comes too late into the movie.  I am sure it was great reading, but makes for an average mystery thriller.  If you like thriller / mysteries it will be worth the watch.  It really takes off but not until the last 20 minutes of the movie.  Overall it is an average movie with some Morgan Freeman spice to make it passable.

Without a doubt, the film is a mess of a thriller, its plot is built upon one silly contrivance after another, and when you're confident the movie can't possibly can't get any more ridiculous, another implausible twist is thrown in for good measure.  The story is riddled with so many questions (How did a certain person know what the other one was up to the whole time?  What are the chances that would be the correct password?  Why do the villains always keep their info on their hard drive, rather than simply erasing it?) it becomes a headache trying to sort it all together by the end.  Then again, you should have an idea of the sort of movie you're headed into when you realize the film's villain is a kidnapper who spent almost every day putting on elaborate facial disguise for two years to pose as a schoolteacher.

This starts out in a deceptively simple manner and becomes graduallymore complex until the end.  Fans of suspense thrillers (such as myself) should really enjoy this. SPOILER ALERT  >>>  The linchpin of the film is Potter's character. Notice how Cross immediately insists upon her presence during the investigation.  She has special knowledge, but does he also want to keep an eye on her?  This subtlety (not in the book from what I understand because there they fall in love) makes Cross seem even more intelligent and perceptive. Sometimes movies improve on books in some aspects. The oldest cliche is 2 people working together who fall in love. This trap is avoided here and it really helps the film. Wincott is terrific and his convincing portrayal makes the lone psycho theory seem to be the only possible explanation for the relative ease of his escape from the school and (later) the ransom.  Potter's resemblance to Julia Roberts is uncanny, although I also saw some Sandra Bullock in her expressions.  This is a wonderful movie for actors to shine and those are my favorite kinds of movies. Thanks to Freeman, Potter and Wincott, this is a riveting and underrated film. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.

The sort of film you feel you've already seen at least twenty-seven times in the last year?) yet never gets out of gear. It brags and postures over its own believed intellectualism, yet we find out nothing that's even remotely deep-felt throughout the entire duration. Instead lots of second-rate actors trudge through a fifth-rate script trying to look vaguely interested.Morgan Freeman, the one decent actor in the piece, struggles gamely to keep awake as all around him descends into formula. You can almost hear him thinking this was so much better when we did it in Se7en. Yet Se7en had Caucasian pretty boy Brad Pitt, and so the aged black Freeman finds himself with a lacklustre script merely due to the fact he's not Hollywood's preferred type. As a sequel to the superior &#150; yet still run-of-the-mill &#150; Kiss The Girls, it's too gimmicky and lacks the cinematic genius to stage its final confrontation to the sound of Little Richard singing Goodnight Irene. The only element that holds any kind of interest is the twist ending, but it's one that's as ludicrous as the rest of the underdeveloped film. For a surprise twist Morgan could've pulled a bunch of pineapples out of his back passage, mooned at the camera and joined the rest of the cast in a rousing rendition of Boney M's Ra Ra Rasputin. Just because something is unexpected does not mean it's any good, or even plausible. A twist ending does not just equal something you didn't expect, but something that should arise logically out of the plot. In fairness, I should have seen it coming anyway.

He is also a terrorist, doing the Mission Impossible bit (TV version) with a peel off face, and kidnaps Megan Rose (Mika Boorem). She is the daughter of Senator and Mrs. Rose (Michael Moriarty and Penelope Ann Miller), who seem to be unlikely candidates because of their relative anonymity in the Congress. The kidnap plan is a meticulous one that Soneji has been fine-tuning for years.When the FBI is called in to assist the Secret Service, who under the watchful eyes of agents Jezzie and Ben (Monica Potter and Billy Burke) allowed the kidnapping of Megan, a minor turf war develops. The game begins when Soneji allows Detective Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) to make a tape of their telephone conversation and provides Cross with a material clue proving that he has the child in his custody. Technically, Cross has no jurisdiction in this case.FBI Agent McArthur (Dylan Baker) heads the task force to retrieve Megan. He thinks that the kidnapper will want a huge ransom, while Cross believes that Soneji sees it all as a big game in which he seeks the recognition of the world and `respect' of law enforcement agencies such as the DC Police, Secret Service and the FBI. Cross is a popular author and Soneji is projecting that one day a book will be written about him.Nine months prior to the kidnapping, Cross's partner was killed in a sting operation, which Agent McArthur thinks the kidnapper is using to work mind games with Cross's self confidence. The plot thickens when it appears that McArthur and Cross are both right.McArthur reluctantly agrees to include Jezzie in the initial kidnap debriefing after Cross makes the point that although Megan was lost under her watch, Jezzie more than anyone else knows about Megan and Soneji because of her three years of observing them at the school. Soon Cross and Jezzie are working together to solve the case. When they stake out what they believe is another news breaking kidnapping, they meet Megan's kidnapper face to face.This fast paced story will keep you guessing as Cross and Jezzie pursue Soneji and attempt to rescue Megan. She is a smart young lady, about the same age as the girl in Spy Kids but with even more savvy. Megan truly takes matters into her own hands to control her fate.The story unfolds with a number of scary moments interspersed with humor, and Cross's consummate mentoring of Jezzie.Tell Me More About It This is a must see film for fans of actor Morgan Freeman or writer James Patterson. It captures the essence of Detective Alex Cross and the evil characters that Patterson is so masterful in creating. Along Came a Spider is a thriller not for the faint of heart.Some of the things that are good about this film are not readily apparent. As events unfold you question the motivations or reasons why a person did or did not do something. Why did Jezzie not call security before rather than after she broke in the door of Soneji's office? Are agents Jezzie and Ben as weak as they appear and do they deserve to be on a baby-sitting detail for three long years? Is the psychological match only between Cross and Soneji or should Cross be looking in more than one direction?The casting of Potter is interesting because she looks like she belongs in her last film, Head over Heels, rather than being a FBI agent. She has the charm of Sandra Bullock, a wide-eyed innocence, plus the smile and possibly the intellect of Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich. Stereotypes do tend to tug at our minds as we try to not just be politically correct, but fair to others, as we'd like for them to be with us. These factors are directly related to assumptions you make about Jezzie.Morgan Freeman is such a good actor that he makes it look easy. He's comfortable in literally any role from a chauffeur (Driving Miss Daisy) to the President of the United States (Deep Impact). Freeman is a master at saying a lot by saying little, and conveying more with his eyes about what he is thinking.Like another best-selling fiction author named Patterson (Richard North), James Patterson knows how to write strong female characters in the midst of what appears to be a story revolving around a group of macho men. In addition to Potter and Boorem, Penelope Ann Miller portrays considerable strength, intelligence and resolve as the concerned parent of a kidnapped child, without the slightest hint of patronization.In the middle of the film, when I thought it was lagging a bit, it was drawing me into the spider web that turns out to be a surprisingly strong ending. It's even more fun than What Lies Beneath, 1) because it's a better story and 2) you can enjoy being surprised as the story unfolds. I can't wait for the next Alex Cross movie based upon a book by James Patterson.both are just that good. Kiss The Girls was good and this is even better.R (violence; language) George O.

At the  beginning of the film we are at the school where Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott.) teaches. At first he may seem like a normal teacher who's been working at the school for about two years but of course he isn't.A few minutes into the film we see him asking a student-Megan Rose (Mika Boorem.) to come to his office. Once she's there Gary kidnaps her and makes a run for it putting her in a 'box' . The school is under close security but sadly they don't make it in time and once they find out that Gary has kidnapped Megan, he's already gone and taken her onto his ship.Once they're on the ship, Gary puts Megan into a small room and peels of his mask to unveil his real face. The news then goes around that Megan, who's the Senators daughter has been kidnapped. Gary then calls up Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman.) and tells he knows Alex is going to on the case to find him. Alex though is still mourning after his partner in crime died eight months earlier. He then decides will go on the case, once he does, he meets Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter.)She wants to work with Alex on the case so Alex agrees and they become parters. After,that we see the search for Megan Rose begin. In the middle of the film, it gets a little bit slow but then it starts to get better again.After a long search for Gary, no one can find him until Gary turns up at Alexs office alone. It looks as if he's going to give himself up. But, then Alex kills Gary but why, he's the only person that knows where Megan is. Not true. Gary did kidnap Megan but doesn't have her anymore. But, who does.A little bit later the twist the occurs it turns out that Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan was the one behind it all. She and her boyfriend Secret Service Agent Ben Devine (Billy Burke.) (Also in with her.) knew that Gary was going to kidnap Megan so they thought they would get in the act with no one else knowing. Then Jezzie ends up killing Ben and takes the jewels which everyone thought were given to Gary as ransom money.Jezzie then looks for Megan who has somehow locked herself in a room with a bed holding the door shut, when Jezzie comes to the 'rescue.' (She really wants to kill Megan though.) Megan is happy and is about the open the door. She then realises that Jezzie is alone and thinks that a little strange. She doesn't open the door then Jezzie tries to find a way in. Megan quickly runs out the room and runs into Alex who tells her be silent. Alex by now obviously realises that Jezzie is the killer. We then find out the when Gary kidnaped Megan, Jezzie could of stopped it but somehow made sure Gary got away. Alex then shoots Jezzie. He and Megan walk away and the film is finished.Along came a Spider is a very exciting thriller and I'd advise anyone to see it. Good performances from everyone too. 8/10  "},{"Title":"I LOVE JAMES PATTERSON AND MORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!","Date":"28 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  This movie was phenomenal.

Still, I have to say that I did find this movie to be quite entertaining and thought it did what it was supposed to do, for a mystery-thriller. It takes off almost immediately, and succeeds in being thoroughly interesting. The plot is pretty good, and experiencing it unravel is pretty intriguing, possibly even more-so than that of other later and contemporary thrillers. The pacing is solid. The acting is good; Freeman is stellar as always, and Potter gives a convincing performance. Wincott surprised me with the high quality of his acting, but maybe that's because I've only seen him in Alien Resurrection, and that movie can make even the most impressive actor seem talentless. Boorem was pretty good for a child-actor, but I have seen better(even at younger ages), so it's no massive accomplishment. The characters are fairly well-written and interesting, but I'm not sure they're entirely credible. The dialog is fairly well-written and equally well-delivered. The special effects are pretty standard stuff, except for a short car-sequence in the beginning which looked entirely convincing. I'm almost certain I know how they did it, but at the moment I saw it, I didn't think about it at all. They pulled that off quite nicely, I think. The film is, like many other recent thrillers, kept going through a number of plot twists, one more unlikely than the other. This is unfortunate, but it seems like that's the way thrillers are going these days. I will say that the twists could have been much, much worse. Overall, a standard mystery-thriller with a good cast and good for at least one attentive viewing. I recommend this to fans of one or more of the actors, the director(if he actually has fans, that is) and/or of the mystery and thriller genres. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Great movie!","Date":"20 February 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Along Came A Spider is great movie.

The actual reason is that Gary was abused and locked into a basement by his stepfamily leading to him having quite a warped outlook on life. He is also very very intelligent and had supposedly murdered more than 200 people. Gary believes that he is intellectually superior to others and can make a game out of the kidnapping because he doesn't believe that he can be caught. He also named himself the 'Son of Lindburgh' after an unsolved kidnapping of a small child in the 1930s, a kidnapping which he admires.Alex Cross is in his late 30s, has children, lives with Nana Mama (as his parents are dead) and has a relationship with Jezzie Flanagan from which the twist appears. The story also unfolds over a period of two years not a couple of weeks as seems to be the case in the film.The problem with this is that Morgan Freeman has been brought in to sell the film on the strength of his performance in Se7en. Unfortunately this is a mistake and they should have hired a younger actor who could have been more like the character in the novel and left the story to sell itself. These days a film that tanks at the box office can recover through word of mouth and DVD sales. The Shawshank Redemption being an example.Also, the plot requires too many leaps of faith and the fact that what the clue was that Alex Cross has picked up on is not very clear and is badly edited making it confusing for the viewer.This story would have been better if it was half an hour longer and used the time to examine the psychological aspects of the film in greater detail. I even believe that it would have been better as a TV mini series which would have allowed the massive FBI manhunt to unfold with greater dramatic effect.

But you have to play fair. You have to tease the audience into trying to figure out what the hell is going on. `Playing fair' means that when a surprise occurs, you recall all the clues that you've seen that should have told you what was just revealed. It gives you encouragement to be cocreator of the narrative. Once this trust is broken, you just don't try, and the whole thing turns out bad. Your mind wanders. For instance, you notice Monica's (surgically?) exaggerated nose and how it's strong upsweep complements Morgan's, perhaps exactly if turned upside down. When you reach this stage, you've lost everything.Nothing in this film plays fair. Worse, there is scant detection, limited to 1) noticing a disconnect in a dialog with the bad guy, but this dialog is itself so artificial that everything in it is a disconnect and 2) guessing a password which even if known could have been spelled a dozen different ways.Freeman does his patented wise cop thing, and we forgive his lazy acting because he is has such an avuncular calm.

In fact lately, that's all he's been making.I wasn't expecting much from Along Came a Spider. I don't particularly remember liking Kiss the Girls that much. I mostly remember that Alex Cross was a leather coat wearing, sport car driving, earring sporting detective that looked more like he should be pimpin' girls than busting the bad guys. But again, he was the best part of an otherwise dismal movie. I think I see a pattern here.Along Came a Spider is more of the same. Alex Cross is a cool, collected character that never seems to get antsy even when the stakes are high. He's also the main character in yet another movie that isn't as good as he is. There are plot discrepancies that are so big that I could drive that cool Porche through.  I really feel badly for Monica Potter.  She's certainly a likable actress in her own right, even if she was in Patch Adams. And I actually liked her in Head Over Heals. It's certainly a sad, sad state of affairs when you make two movies in one year and the better one has Freddie Prinze Jr. in a starring role. Ouch.Even as blah as Along Came a Spider was, with it's retarded characters and plot twists that can be seen coming a mile away, I still wouldn't mind seeing Morgan Freeman play Alex Cross again.

The picture has a quick, violent, slam-bang opening then quiets down.  The plot is very familiar and the script has some dull moments.  Also, at the end, the film throws all plausibility out the window and throws in some totally unbelievable twists and turns.  Thinking about them after the movie, I realized that they made absolutely no sense and couldn't have even happened!  Two performances save the movie--Morgan Freeman, good as always and Michael Wincott who's very good as the kidnapper.  He gives the character a lot of depth and is riveting whenever he's on screen.  Monica Potter, however, is terrible.  It's not entirely her fault...her part is very poorly written and things happen to her character at the end that come out of nowhere.  So, all in all, just an OK movie.  There are worse movies of its type, but there are better ones also. "},{"Title":"Wow!

This movie is a cookie cutter kidnaping movie, they might as well have just titled it hey, we can write a 100% unoriginal movie that just cuts and paste pieces of kiss the girls/seven/ransom together and end up with a ridiculus plot that is full of holes yet still make a ton of money!  At each plot twist i couldn't help but just laugh, the screen writer should just be sued for infringing on copyrights, then tard and featherd and run out of LA with the producers.  At each turn of events i couldn't help to feel a very strong case of deja-vu, just like 'hey i saw that in (insert kidnapping movie here.)'  In general, i have a big gripe with movie producers, if a movie or genere of movies does well then we as movie viewers are submited to a bombardment of copycats and just general rip offs. In closing, if you watch this movie looking for a good suspense movie, you will be dissapointed at the non ending awful cliches.

Hold it under your nose for 90 minutes while inhaling deeply.  That's the olfactory equivalent of watching this film. I can't imagine any reason other than contractual obligations why Morgan Freeman would agree to be an accessory to this.  From the soporific sequence in which Freeman and his blonde mannequin like partner drone on and on for what seems like hours, to the lame, cliched games of the kidnapper (including a direct ripoff of Dirty Harry) to the absolutely ludicrous 'plot twist' which seemed as if they ran out of script before they had 90 minutes worth of story, to the endless mouthing of the kidnapper's name, (Soneji! Soneji! Soneji! over and over and over) and especially the idiotically contrived scene in which Freeman guesses a password, complete with the use of '&' instead of 'and' on the FIRST TRY, this 'movie' absolutely reeked.  If I was a director and had dropped this turd of a film, I would have credited it to Allen Smithee and gone back to working in a video store.  Don't go and see this.  Remember the names of the director, Lee Tamahori and the screenwriter, Marc Moss and boycott all of their future 'work'.  Do this and you may strike a small blow for good movie making.

So I'll try keep my voice down..This is amazing. A perfect example of Hollywood being in control of everything in a movie production. Either that or the writer and/or director has gone raving mad!Nothing in this movie can't be foreseen. Every little detail is spelled out - so the stupid people in the audience can keep up. Actually I find this offensive!And what's with the computers/software in movies these days?? Is Hollywood making fun of us? Don't they think that we know how computers work in this day and age? These kinds of scenes almost make me leave the cinema... Combine the hacking of the Unix system in Jurassic Park with the look around corners in Blade Runner. And there you go.The Actors do their best to keep the story afloat, but not even Mr. Freeman saves it. Sad. Sad.Hmmm, I have to say something good.. Morgan Freeman's acting is, as always super. Monica Potter is.. well, nice to look at ) all do their best despite the bad bad script.Oh, and it was a GREAT laugh! I really recommend this movie if you've had a couple of beers and need a laugh with your friends!I'm sorry my first review had to turn into a bashing anyway, but I guess this movie just triggered me...

Alex gets connected with Monica Potter(Jizzie Flannigan),I'm with Lucy,'02, who is also a detective and works with Alex as his partner.  Alex is very attractive and adds some excitement but very little romance.  The film deals also with a child being kidnapped and there is also mention about the Old Lindburg case in the 1930's.   Michael Wincott(Gary Soneji),Treasure Planet,'02, plays the bad guy who is very sick mentally and keeps Alex and Jizzie on the run through out the entire picture.   Morgan Freeman was fantastic in this picture which kept me on the edge of my seat just wondering how the ending would turn out.  Sit back and enjoy this picture, it is worth viewing.

Soneji decides that he will only deal with Alex Cross (Freeman). Here starts the game.This film had me captured from the word go, yes It has type cast Freeman slightly in his profiler/cop mode, but he is so good at it. Michael Wincott, who is probably best known for his appearance in the Crow, was fantastic as the kidnapper. The twists in the plot were very good and kept me on the edge of my seat.Well written and well acted a definate buy on DVD for me.

The graphics of the Car Crash was too bad, i should say too kiddish. One would loose their very image of the movie after that, no matter how well it was shot. Tried to cash on the perfomance of the Child Artist in Bless The Child, Ol tricks dont work anymore. Over all the tempo of the movie was not maintained. I lost interest in the first 20 minutes of the movie. A bag of Pop Corn kept me busy for the rest of the show. Along came the spider and along went my money.

I had already read Along Came A Spider a while before I read the book Kiss the Girls, and hated it with a passion. It was a boring read, and I wondered before I went to the movie theater why they bothered to make a movie from such a crappy book. But, I went and paid my money to watch the movie anyway. The movie is a disaster. As much as I love Morgan Freeman as an actor, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My advice is to watch a better Freeman movie, like Power Of One or Shawshank Redemption. Don't waste your time on this movie. (Its not Freeman's fault- the script/plot stunk in the first place- no where to go from there but downward.)

It's a good story, but the acting and lines are almost laughably bad in parts. Monica Potter is gorgeous, but delivers her lines with little drama. Why is it that so many directors these days are intent on the ladies' hair always being in such perfect shape, and even after severe exertion don't show any sweat?!

The premise of having the daughter of a senator kidnapped isn't all that different from the very overrated SILENCE OF THE LAMBS ( And umpteen other thrillers of this ilk ) so in order for it to stand out we're treated to a lot of plot twists . Unfortunately I think we have a couple of twists too many by the end of the film . Remember that line  With your TV switched up loud a whole SWAT team could have come in here unnoticed  ? Didn't you just know by this point that another twist was going to happen and that it held no more surprises ?

A young little girl is kidnapped and ransomed by a very clever but unknown criminal living on a boat. Morgan Freeman is the detective hired to try and find the girl, he recently lost his partner in a car accident and is still trying to forget it. He has a look at the last place the parents of the girl saw her and he discovers that nothing has been moved or touched and he planned the kidnap very carefully, as sly as a spider (hence the title) Monica Potter (from Patch Adams) is partnered with Freeman to help him, and he doesn't know it, but she is involved with the kidnapper and she turns into a real bitch.
