[{"Title":"A Guilty Pleasure","Date":"5 December 2001","Score":"128 out of 143 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi","Review":"  There are great films (Citizen Kane, eg), and there are big films, like ET or Star Wars.  Then there are absolute crap films (eg, WAY too-many to list!).  I propose another legitimate category Guilty Pleasure Films. These are movies that one can see over and over, through countless repetitions on cable and broadcast channels, and enjoy the experience every time.For example, I have probably seen Brighton Beach Memoirs 40 times.  I loved it during its first run, and I've loved it each of the 39 times I've seen it on the small screen.  No, it's not a great movie, but it's one that brings me pleasure when I watch it.  Same with (blush) Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure the movie's stupid, but it just always entertains me!Similarly, nobody is going to compare The Final Countdown to 2001 A Space Odyssey as far as absolute quality, but The Final Countdown is a classic example of an unabashed guilty pleasure movie.The story is intriguing--what would YOU do if you were commanding a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier full of supersonic jets, etc, when you were transferred through a time-warp (ref a CHEESY looking laser and smoke effect storm!) to December 6, 1941?? Would you alter history, just to win a battle against those attacking Pearl Harbor? Or would you hold back because you'd change history if you did anything?Interesting point! Kirk Douglas, as the ship's captain, looks like he's having a ball acting in this, and Martin Sheen does a great job as the civilian consultant, Mr. Laskey.No, this movie isn't an Oscar-winner, nor did it really deserve to be.  But I'll put it this way.  A local independant station showed The Final Countdown tonight at the same time TNN was showing The Godfather 2 uncut.I spent maybe five minutes on the Oscar-winning Godfather 2.  Yes, it is an empirically great film, but I've seen it once before.  But with American fighter jets dogfighting 1941 Japanese Zeros, I was FAR more entertained watching The Final Countdown for the 10th time!

Realistic acting, special effects and air scenes really make this movie stand out from other similar movies. I'm really surprised that this film is not more popular, because this was a very unique and fascinating concept for a movie, especially back in 1980. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good science-fiction film. I'm also surprised that it has such a low rating, I was expecting it to be rated at least a 7.

Having served on an aircraft carrier for 2.5 years, I'm familiar with aircraft carrier excitement. But the movie was more than just wonderful shots of the U.S. Nimitz. The cast was top drawer, and their acting was as good as it gets. Standing above all the great performances was a Japanese actor portraying a shot-down, highly competent, captured Japanese Zero pilot. While racism understandably raises its ugly head during wartime, with epithets and insults hurled in both directions, in fact this Japanese actor portrayed a Japanese warrior at his finest--someone whom Japanese viewers would be proud of. Played equally well were American military personnel, including some Marines. One of the candid themes of the movie is the tragedy of such fine people going to war against each other, whatever their race.The film is undeniably top drawer, far more mature than than Top Gun, with even better flying scenes. So I've often wondered why it isn't widely known and not kept in stock in widescreen format. Perhaps the answer is today's wimpy trend towards politically correct dialog. In one scene, Kirk Douglas refers to the captured Japanese pilot as a yellow bastard. In the video version, this was sanitized. However, sanitized or not, the original racial comment, by itself, may have doomed the film from greater video distribution.I saw the film when it came out in wide-screen format and saw it several times before it left town. Thereafter, the only other versions available in video were fit-to-TV-screen size. That was tragic! Though still exciting in box format, the widescreen original was breathtaking. I cannot imagine why producers haven't released this in DVD in original wide-screen format. It makes a huge difference with this film! (Aircraft carriers are huge!)One interesting comment to add about the F-14 flying scenes. I was awed by one particular F-14 maneuver, which I didn't think airplanes were capable of doing. A couple of years later, I talked with a Navy fighter pilot and brought this up. He was very familiar with that scene and personally knew the pilot who flew the F-14 in the movie. He told me that the F-14 almost crashed in that scene, stalling while trying to fly too slow, diving for the ocean to pick up speed, and barely recovering just above the wave tops. This near-accident was caught on film and added immensely to the exhibition of flying skill. An exception had been granted to the Navy's policy of not allowing dissimilar aircraft to fly together in movie scenes. The result of that granted exception was almost the loss of an F-14.This is an incredibly good drama. I found that the various twists and turns, and particularly the call-it-off ending, all contributed to the drama and moral dilemmas. This is a fine, great movie. Like others who commented here, it seems tragic that this film is not available in widescreen DVD format. Everyone I've shown it to loves it, male and female. Feminism and romance are included, along with a collie dog for the kids.

What happens (which isn't actually much) takes a back seat to 1) an Oscar-caliber performance by Kirk Douglas as ship captain, and also fine performances by Sheen, Durning and others; and 2) the wonder of tactical operations on a modern carrier.

If the story doesn't require major air or naval assets, a script disapproved of by the top brass can be convincingly brought to the screen.  Two examples - both true stories that the Pentagon didn't want to support - are Men of Honor reflecting the epidemic racism of the not-that-long-ago Navy and Sgt. Bilko, a film portraying what some noncoms do to earn extra income (trust me, it's a true story a real Sgt. Bilko worked (officially but not actually) for me when I was an Army officer.But when you need lots of planes and ships, you gotta have official help. And few movies have gotten more assistance than the producer, director and cast of The Final Countdown, now available on DVD,a sci-fi recruiting spectacular that features - on loan at taxpayer expense - the huge carrier U.S.S. Nimitz complete with crew.  Now that's cooperation!Kirk Douglas skippers the supercarrier which is on Pacific Fleet maneuvers. On board as some sort of efficiency consultant is a young Martin Sheen, not yet ready for the West Wing.  A mysterious and never explained weather phenomenon grips the mighty floating air base and to the unfolding amazement of captain, officers and crew dawns the realization that the Nimitz in sailing not that far from Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1941.Meanwhile a U.S. senator, played by one of Hollywood's deservedly decorated war heroes, Charles Durning, is enjoying his yacht, also near Pearl, while dictating to his lovely secretary, Katharine Ross.  A brace of Japanese Zeroes sink the yacht, killing two passengers which then prompts the carrier C.O. to order trailing F-14 Tomcats to splash the enemy.  Durning and Ross are rescued.  Without a word, this talented actor's face does a comical double-take when introduced to the ship's executive officer who just happens to be black (in 1941 a black navy man could only serve as a steward in the officers mess.  That was it.  Period.)The dilemma facing Douglas, of course, is a classic time-travel conundrum. To interfere with the course of history (the carrier's air wing can make instant teriyaki of the six Japanese carriers) or to let events take their known and disastrous course.A chaste incipient romance between the nearly drowned damsel and the carrier's Commander Air Group competes with the white knuckle decision-making struggle of the C.O.So much for the plot.  What is on offer here is a demonstration of every aircraft type, fixed-wing and rotary, deployed on the vessel as well as demonstrations of shipboard activities ranging from retrieving a damaged jet to going to General Quarters to...you name it.  The technical advisers knew they had a film crew pliant to every suggestion.  The result is a genuinely exciting show- a great warship going through its paces.  And, unlike Tora Tora Tora it doesn't appear that any genuine sailors were harmed in the making of the movie.There's one big problem.  A science fiction story is usually utterly improbable, indeed impossible, but its internal logic is vital it must be consistent.  Spielberg understands that very well.  Watch the first couple of minutes when Sheen is greeted by his employer's lackey and the last minutes when he debarks from the Nimitz.  Something is very, very off-kilter. Could the CEO of a great military-industrial conglomerate have used top secret technology to send the carrier back to 1941 for...So what.  This is a beautifully filmed adventure story, not a great film. The cast probably relished taking over the carrier for a while and the real captain, never shown, surely wished that the Navy hadn't banned hard spirits from our ships in World War I.

To this day I wonder which, if any, sailors and Marines I saw were actual service people. If any were, Don Taylor and his second-unit directorial crew got excellent small performances from them.

And that's a little detail that's done right so seldom that I hardly notice anymore that I'm deliberately overlooking it.The aerial sequences set a standard that wouldn't be touched until /Top Gun/ hit the screen.  To be sure, both movies relied to some extent on stock footage of naval-aviation ops, but as with /Top Gun/, this film's flying was spectacular -- and, in the last of the years before CGI took hold, REAL.

The story -- revealed by plenty of other comments here -- though implausible, is still capable of holding one's interest.

If it's on TV again, watch it.  At the least, it's an entertaining story.  At its best, it's a good study in style and pacing.

The film fails to give the audience what it is promised in trailers and posters, a conflict between a lone united states nuclear carrier and the entire japanese pearl harbor attack force. Yet, this is a fine picture with some fine acting moments unusual to this genre. During the film the carrier swept to DEC. 6, 1941 takes a evasive stance while the crew and commander try to decide whether to alter history..yet, if they alter history will their ship even be made? Will they die once the paradox begins? Will the abortive theme FROM HERE TO ETERNITY love story work out? These questions and more are answered in a award winning PG film from the director of ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES, the star of SPARTACUS, a effects team behind the 007 opening montages and the producer of THE TOXIC AVENGER.

Kind of a nice feather in my cap experiencing the world's largest 'time machine' in person! On to the movie... A very interesting premise which should have merited a more detailed analysis! Executed well enough for 1980, but could be remade into one hell of a motion picture today! I'd love to see it. One thing the story does well is get one thinking about the 'what-if' scenario having the most modern carrier in the today's fleet taking on the Japanese Navy almost 40 years prior... Hmm. What a mismatch that would be in much the same way that **** SPOILER ALERT **** Combat Air Patrol (CAP) Tomcats rendered the 'Zeroes ' splashed handily! But, the very nature of Paradoxes would have rendered intervention potentially destructive to Nimitz and all aboard! (Which would have made profound changes to MY naval career as well.) And that was the dilemma faced; Do we change history because we feel a conscious duty to tilt the war in our favor (At least in the short term.)? Or do we choose to let nature take its course knowing full well the outcome if nothing is done? 4 more years of war and millions of lives? Or win a decisive victory and save all of the agony yet to come at the possible expense of destroying the fabric of space/time... or at the very least causing the U.S. and the Allies to lose in the long run because the U.S. would have delayed entering the war? Thorny, eh? As it turns out, history in this film was changed in a minor way but then again... was it? Possible predestination paradox, meaning events were supposed to happen the way they did. ***SPOILER ALERT*** If the Nimitz had stayed to fight, logistically it would have been possible... for a short time. Without access to spare parts, jet fuel and other means of support, the ship would have been nearly useless. True, this vessel class can steam for over 20 years on a fresh set of plutonium rods, but jets can't fly without fuel or spare parts! And just imagine trying to provision that ship with its crew of 5000 plus with 1940's technology! This ignores what the U.S. Government would have done once they got their hands on Nimitz and her technology back then! The debriefing would never end for those people! And imagine the changes to history then! (Could be a whole other movie!) All in all, I think it was a great piece of science fiction and a very enjoyable 'what if'... I recommend anyone see it who can! It has its flaws and is dated but the concept is still very valid. The movie's big strength is not so much what is said, but what is not. The important stuff is left to the viewer's imagination, and this is what makes it very entertaining and provocative! This is the movie that made the USS Nimitz a household word and I am very proud to have served on a piece of science fiction history (no pun intended)! The ship is very distinguished and far more impressive 'in the steel' than she is on film. I give this film a 7.9/10. Mostly for the powerful premise.

Let me explain. The film was shot almost entirely on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz with the Navy's full cooperation. Now one might think that was quite a coup for the filmmakers, but on viewing the finished product, it seems very constrictive. Sure, there is plenty of footage of navy jets taking off and landing that's fun to watch, in and of itself. But too often such footage seems to be at the expense of the movie itself, and its plot, and having anything really interesting happen. For instance, early on, one of the jets returning to the carrier reports trouble with its landing hook, which is supposed to grab a tether when it lands on deck. So the order is given to raise the emergency barrier to prevent the plane from going off the other end of the deck into the ocean. This is done and the jet lands safely. That's it. It has nothing to do with any part of the plot. In fact, it's like watching a training film for navy recruits. Far too much of 'The Final Countdown' IS like watching a navy training film, unfortunately. The actors and the film's story seem like intruders aboard the Nimitz. Many scenes are unambitiously cut short. The reality of the ship sinks the believability of the story. We never for one minute believe Kirk Douglas is really the captain of the Nimitz. It's obvious too, that many of the ship's crew were used as extras. Here the problem is just the opposite. They have zero screen presence. One of the reasons you hire professional actors for movies is they ARE professionals and have spent a great deal of time learning their skills at projecting a character and speaking lines of dialogue effectively. Whoever it is that says, Captain on bridge, and Captain off bridge about thirty times has obviously never acted in his life. A shame too, since the story idea is a good one, albeit one straight out of Time Travel 101. What if a modern day aircraft carrier was somehow transported back in time to the day before the Pearl Harbor attack? Even though it's not a terribly original premise, there are so many ways one can have fun with the idea, so many possibilities. But all 'The Final Countdown' can do is nibble around the edges. The requisite questions are asked What if I meet my own grandfather and he dies? Or, what if someone who was meant to die, survives? What if the captain warns Washington? What if the Nimitz attacks and defeats the Japanese fleet? Unfortunately, again, the questions as phrased above are about as far as 'The Final Countdown' gets in playing with any of the tantalizing might-have-beens. One begins wishing for even a long, drawn-out conversation between two of the characters about those various possibilities. But the screenwriters cannot so much as bring themselves to do that, and such scenes are cut short as well. The brutal truth is that nothing much of anything happens in this movie and at the end, one is left with a huge 'so what?' kind of feeling. 'The Final Countdown' should have been titled 'The Final Letdown.'

However, as we are forced to face again and again, what is awesome when one is 12 is not the same as what is awesome when one is over 30.This movie forces us to look inside ourselves and ask What would happen if a state-of-the-art (for 1980) aircraft carrier were transported back in time to the eve of Pearl Harbor? Then there are all the regular questions about the Prime Directive, the ethics of using advance knowledge and advanced technology, blah blah blah. The situation is the hook of the movie, a pretty good one. Unfortunately, it's also the only thing the movie has to offer.After some exposition that gets top military whiner Martin Sheen on the boat, and some unrelated techo-fetishism about the way those sweet F-14s land, a mysterious storm that looks a lot like a laser and a fog machine appears in the sky and causes the sailors to hold their heads. When it goes away, they are in 1941 (the year, not the movie), and they have to grapple with many philosophical questions about whether they should whup the Japs' asses but good.A good 35% of the movie is just flat-out recruiting-film military techno fetishism. It's kind of cool for a while, as you watch planes swoosh and dive, and it reminds you of the days when the prospect of going into the military meant you were going to fly cool planes and do cool things instead of simply being sent to a desert to be killed. But it gets tiresome after awhile, though it does remain quite visible, so you can fast-forward without fear of missing anything.There's a small bit of derisive laughter as the crew (during the LONG period in which they are coming to accept that they have traveled back in time) compare a photo that was apparently taken an hour ago by one of their planes to a photo that was taken 40 years previously by another plane. The cast bravely pretends not to notice that they are THE EXACT SAME PHOTO. Amazing coincidence! There's another movie right there.The performances fit the material. Kirk Douglas is actually quite charming as the captain. He projects authority, yet is warm and approachable, and isn't afraid to say he doesn't know what's going on. Martin Sheen appears to be on hand simply to deliver speeches about how very morally complex it all is. Former Superfly Ron O'Neal is around as eye candy for me. Katherine Ross is in full do I have to do anything except stand around and be dewy? mode, but she will always get props from me for ensnaring gravelly man-hunk Sam Elliott in her wicked web.This movie is a bit like those alternative history novels, which are usually about what if the South won the Civil War, which translates as;what if we'd kept the blacks in their place. This one, I think, is about redressing the perceived imbalance that occurred when the US was caught unawares. But how could we be caught unawares&#133; we're the United States! I think the enjoyment of this movie for some people is in floating the fantasy that we could show them Japs once and for all.This movie is also notable as a likely influence on 80s rock group Europe's cheesy hit of the same title.SPOILERS>>> The end of this movie cops out by having the mysterious storm appear at the PRECISE moment that the US is just about to attack the Japanese fleet. The aircraft carrier is transported back to the same time it left, everyone shrugs and goes Huh, and they go about their average workday.

On the other hand, many details are wrong, most obvious is the wrong base on the wrong side of the U.S. The time travel paradox WRT Tideman is pretty interesting. I disagree with an earlier reviewer WRT this. Quantum theory allows for Tideman to exist in two states at one time since he is not observed at the beginning. The image of carrier life is especially good. I had several close friends who were officers on the Nimitz at the time it was filmed. Much better than most Hollywood movies such as Top Gun. An interesting aside is that several Navy people got fried because of this film. This was before the Top Gun mentality, and Navy Brass were not too thrilled about the level of access given for this film. It was claimed that mid level officers gave approval for use of the Nimitz for this film without proper authority. This was before the Navy woke up to the recruiting potential of such films, so use of the Nimitz was regarded as fraud, waste and abuse. Acting is tacky in many cases...the ship and the aviators are the stars. Most of the effects were shot using real aircraft, again a controversial issue at the time. One of my best friends was a pilot in the Black Panther A-6 squadron shown. It really makes one think how average people would react if thrust into a similar situation. In short, there will likely never be a movie like this made again. It's kind of analogous to Frankenheimer's Grand Prix where the filmers were permitted to enter their own cars into the races. The staggering expense of producing such films makes them rare. It's too bad that some people suffered professional punishment for making Navy resources available to make this film when the Navy rewarded people involved in Top Gun, in many ways a much less realistic film.

The storyline seemed to have wanted to present us a real modern moral dilemma but instead gave us some silly 1980's made for TV drama. The scene where they put an dangerous POW to interrogate right next to a civilian and the Americans they did rescue, was one of the dumbest movie scenes ever. Talk about a lack of any common sense.

The Captain & crew quickly realise this fact & also realise the significance of the date as the 15th December was the eve of the Pearl Harbour attack by the Japanese during World War II, Captain Yelland must decide whether to intervene & defeat the Japanese & risk changing all of recorded history or whether to stand by & do nothing...Directed by Don Taylor this is an interesting sci-fi fantasy drama that is hard to categorise & while the potential was here for something special I personally think The Final Countdown falls somewhat short. Credited with four screenwriters time travel had rarely been tackled in an intelligent or thought provoking way before in cinema, the majority of films to feature the concept of time travel merely used either the past or future to set some sort of adventure in & I suspect it was the makers intention to add a little thought to the idea. At 100 odd minutes The Final Countdown starts off briskly enough & the Nimitz & crew are stuck in 1941 fairly quickly & then the debate begins & the real point of the film is made, basically what if we could change history? Should we & what would the consequences be? The whole time paradox issue is brought up & things are discussed & debated & both sides of the argument are represented by old fashioned Commander Owens who believes things are what they are & cocky young office boy Lasky who sees immense possibilities in righting past mistakes, both men have their stand point & opinions & luckily the film never becomes too bogged down with hypothetical chit chat although that's not to say there isn't any because there is. The film moves along at a reasonable pace, while not exactly fast it maintains one interest through a strong story & some decent if restrained action. Now, the major talking point is the climax, the cop-out climax where no-one is forced to make any kind of decision which after investing an hour & forty minutes in it feels a little bit of a let down. The character's are quite well balanced with opinions & views, surprisingly not every naval officer wants to go to war & the dialogue is pretty good too.The one aspect that really adds to The Final Countdown was that it was actually shot on the USS Nimitz which gives it amazing authenticity, the real crew were used in shots & the makers were allowed to film training exercises & the like. This really looks authentic because basically it is. Apparently footage from the Pearl Harbour war film Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) was edited into The Final Countdown presumably to cut costs or to represent scenes they were unable to film. The special effects are pretty poor, the storm effects in particular look very dated. The aircraft flying scenes however look good & were probably mostly real except for a few model shots.Filmed in the Atlantic Ocean on the real USS Nimitz, Virginia & Florida the film looks good with the actual Nimitz location invaluable, I doubt set makers could have done anywhere near as convincing a job. The cult song The Final Countdown by Eruope is not featured anywhere, bummer. There's a good cast on show including Kirk Douglas, James Farentino, Katharine Ross, Charles Durning & Martin Sheen who in this really looks almost exactly like the way his son Charlie would during his mid to late 80's films.The Final Countdown is a sci-fi fantasy drama that tried to experiment with the time travel concept & was one of the first to explore the consequences & decisions surrounding it but a seriously none event of a climax & a slightly slow pace may leave some frustrated, an interesting & watchable curiosity but not a must see.

Forget it because this came first, nor does it submit to cheese/silliness in what could've been a nonsensical premise. Gladly it doesn't, however for a fantasy / Sci-fi film that's impressively ambitious, and grand in scope. Talk about a cop-out for an ending! Or was it? The novelty of the concept flourishes with intelligence and vision, but it felt like something you would find in an episode of The Twilight Zone. Maybe it would've been better suited so. The story begins with a freak storm transporting a modern American nuclear-powered aircraft carrier back to 1941, just before the Japanese fleet bombed Pearl Harbour. Now the question is should they get involved, and fear changing the face of history. Tough call. Too bad the film doesn't really take up that challenging stance with much aplomb, and somewhat takes an easy way out. On an ethical note, the question raised is do we really have the right to change what has already happened. The paradox brings up many interesting possibilities, and drums up unimaginable suspense. It's an anxious waiting game for the decision, and that's what its all about. After deciding, it suddenly changes and leaves you hanging there with what could've been. The final note to me, made it all the forgettable. The material might not have been wholly satisfying, but technically it mainly came off with dazzling results. What was spectacularly done was the work they managed to get while filming on the actual U.S.S Nimitz. It feels, and looks authentic&#133; because it is. They filmed at sea on the boat, at certain intervals. The background features at times seemed to be more interesting, than the actual story. Watching the crew going through their manoeuvres was magnetically displayed. Also the aircraft scenes were remarkably done, and excitingly high powered. The special effects are dated, but managed to be atmospherically eerie and moodily colourful. Figure heads Kirk Douglas (in a durably solid turn), Martin Sheen and at a lesser extent Charles Dunning give the film some stalwart class. Also showing up in the profound cast were Katherine Ross, James Farentino and Ron O'Neal. John Scott's heavy handed music score, was hit-and-miss, but Victor J. Kemper's expansive cinematography was professionally executed. Don Taylor's direction feels automatic, but breezy. This boy's own adventure is an enjoyably, attention-grabbing what if predicament.

It is best when it takes its premise and the realities of the Navy seriously.There are loads of great movie moments, including the Tomcats vs. Zeros dogfight, the captured Japanese pilot continuing to act like he's at war, the time-traveling pooch and, especially, the many moments of idiocy from the rescued Senator who can't believe he hasn't been let in on the secret of the Nimitz and--horrors--that at least one senior officer of the vintage 1980 carrier is African-American.But there are problems in the script that could have been addressed to make it a more convincing movie.  The characters spend way too much time pondering should we or shouldn't we change history? when in reality as intelligent, pragmatic problem solvers they likely would have been addressing other immediate difficulties1)  Traveling through the time storm, the Nimitz arrives in 1941 without its accompanying destroyer escorts.  While the film pretends that the 1980s technology is pretty much invulnerable, that isn't the case, particularly given carriers' status as large targets.  Not only would the carrier have launched air patrols (as done in the film) but its officers immediately would have been spending considerable effort in trying to decide how to defend against possible submarine attack.  (The Japanese had excellent torpedoes, quite capable of sinking or severely damaging a carrier of any vintage.)1a) One possible solution would have been to rendezvous with the existing 1941 American carriers at sea (remember, the Nimitz has a Pearl Harbor expert on board who would know their location), thus gaining a destroyer screen *and* being able to lead a combined attack on the Japanese fleet. (BTW, this follows the military principles of concentration of force and surprise, both well known to serving officers.)2) However, this introduces another difficulty.  Tensions were fairly high at the time, and a strange aircraft carrier appearing near Oahu would have been assumed to be a hostile Japanese ship and likely attacked on sight (just as an actual Japanese miniature sub was sunk before the air assault on Pearl Harbor).  Thus the other big problem would have been how to make contact with American forces and provide warning.  This should have engaged considerable attention, particularly given that even their historical expert wouldn't likely know specific codes, frequencies, recognition signals and the like.  The many possible plot complications are obvious.  Since the characters don't know that the Nimitz will return to 1980 at film's end, they would be assuming contact to be necessary.  (The Nimitz can't wander around unseen and unsupplied for the rest of WWII.  It will have to make contact.)3) I won't say too much about the possible violations of the space-time continuum involved, but all of you who are Back to the Future fans can fill them in.  If we take these seriously contact becomes very difficult and the movie actual ending seems almost inevitable.4) A possible solution with minimal effect on the continuum and taking advantage of the contact difficulty would have been for the Nimitz to launch its own mock attack on Pearl Harbor in advance of the Japanese attack (preferably before dawn, so its planes could not be identified as alien to the time).  This would alert US defenses and greatly reduce US casualties and damage.  (However, this assumes more or less that the Nimitz knows it's going back to 1980.)5) Whatever the Nimitz's possible intervention, it would not be able to prevent US entry into WWII, since other Japanese attacks on US bases, most notably in the Philippines, would bring the US into the war, as would any hostile action by the Nimitz.  The historical expert on board would know this, as would all the senior officers, products of an excellent educational system.  Figuring this into their deliberations would have added considerable interest.  Destruction of the Japanese fleet aircraft carriers six months before it actually happened (at the Battle of Midway) might have considerably shortened the war.Thus, the biggest logical flaw in the film is not that aircraft carriers cannot go rocketing through time portals.  That's a part of the film's premise and we have to accept it or immediately leave the theater. Rather, the film doesn't take the very real problems that would be faced by its decision-makers quite seriously enough, as suggested above.  (I could go on, but there's a word limit here.)  The more seriously these are dealt with within the limitations of screen time, the better the film would have been.That said, it's still a cool film.  Much, much better than Pearl Harbor, which doesn't take any of its subject matter seriously.  But that would be another review.

This long-lost, underappreciated, almost forgotten classic really deserves full-feature deluxe DVD treatment.The producers of FINAL COUNTDOWN were able to team up a stellar cast of quality Hollywood actors with a full Navy crew and full Pentagon participation, thanks to an enthralling storyline that raises all sorts of daunting issues, yet deals with those challenges in a sincere and reverent fashion that tickles the mind and emotions.FINAL COUNTDOWN is flawed and in some ways seems dated now (i.e. cheesy, slow, not glossy enough).  But its heart is in the right place and that makes up for any contemporary imperfections.  (John Scott's luxurious orchestral score also helps.)I never saw FINAL COUNTDOWN til I was in 5th grade when it came on TV, so I'm not sure how much money it made in its theatrical run*, or if United Artists still owns the rights (enabling MGM to release a Special Edition DVD with remastered 5.1 soundtrack and interviews with the makers).  (* = The producer only made movies for a short period, and none of his others were successes, so it seems that Final Countdown must have been financially mediocre since his career was so brief.)When the commercials for FINAL COUNTDOWN's TV airing revealed the movie's story concept, every kid at school was freaked out, so we knew we had to watch.  But I remember being so upset when I looked at the clock and realized there was only 15 minutes left, and therefore there was no way the movie could possibly contain a full satisfying epic dogfight battle over Pearl Harbor while still returning the characters to their rightful places in time for a happy ending and final credits.  So when the actual ending arrived I was phenomenally disappointed. Aawww, man!  It seemed like such a cheat. Then again, not every movie can afford a budget of Star Wars-level special effects, so perhaps this movie did the best it could.  After all, real-life veterans groups probably would have complained if the movie had actually dared to rewrite WWII and provoke a scenario glimpsing at a world in which America had successfully nailed the Imperial Japanese fleet, thus enabling the US to stay out of the war... What would the movie have hinted at as the aftermath of this alteration of history?  Would Hitler have conquered Europe, or would the Allies have been able to hold off the Axis powers without American help?  It's comic-book fantasy obviously, but at least on that level it's still spooky.Still, the younger boy within me still fantasizes about the unmade version of Final Countdown, featuring a climactic spectacle of heavily-armed F-14 Tomcats surprising the you-know-what out of primitive Zero squadrons over Honolulu while American soldiers on the ground look up at this sight in frightened befuddlement wondering what the heck is going on.

Oh. and they also rescue the pilot of one of the Japanese zeroes that sunk the cabin cruiser, Soon Teck Oh.The Final Countdown is a good science fiction film that raises some interesting conundrum like questions. Would you kill Adolph Hitler or Joseph Stalin as a child if you got the chance? Should the Nimitz with the firepower it has go wreak some havoc on the Japanese fleet before they strike?Other good performances in the film besides those mentioned are James Farentino as the air group commander and amateur historian and Ron O'Neal as the Executive officer of the Nimitz. My favorite in the film however is Soon Teck Oh. He speaks only Japanese in the film and he manages to invoke both menace and fright in his performance of a man, also not knowing what's happening but knowing he's with the American enemy.You'll be scratching your head for days after seeing The Final Countdown.

Air/Sea Rescue supported by triumphant music. The helo crew save two survivors of a strafed yacht. They save Katherine Ross's dog too. Well-done aerial shots, illustrating refueling procedures. And a glance or two at the bridge of the Nimitz.Frankly, I was astonished. It's all buttons. If the skipper, Kirk Douglas of the cleft chin, sings out, Give me twenty-five knots headwind across the flight deck, the quartermaster (if that is in fact what he is) simply punches a course into some kind of electronic junk the shape of a reclining refrigerator. There is nobody at the helm because there is no helm for anybody to be at. Nothing even remotely resembles the equipment of the destroyer-sized Coast Guard cutter I served eight unforgettable months on. I don't think it would be much fun to work on the Nimitz. No sense of the sea, more a feeling of living in a huge, congested, immaculate iron city, cluttered with industrial yellow heavy movers and fire trucks. It might as well be a construction site.Martin Sheen is a civilian systems analyst (read efficiency expert) assigned to the Nimitz. Sheen is welcomed aboard by Douglas but has a contretemps with one of the pilots, James Farentino. Shortly after Sheen's arrival, the Nimitz runs into an extremely odd electrical storm that produces generous lightning and a horrible screeching sound. Everyone is knocked about for a few minutes and when they recover, still dazed, everything seems normal again. Douglas sounds general quarters, launching a period of organized chaos. The fulsome score borrows from Patton and from 633 Squadron. It begins to look like a long and lavishly budgeted episode of the original Twilight Zone -- and it stays that way. It's December 6th, 1941, and the Japanese fleet is on its way to attack Pearl Harbor. Douglas and his men figure this out shortly, when they pick up the Japanese fleet on radar.Cut to an old-fashioned wooden yacht, shellacked and painted, with Charles Durning and Katherine Ross, after whom Senator Durning lusts. They're listening to a speech being broadcast by President Roosevelt warning the nation of the danger by foreign aggressors. (Kids, that's President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served out almost four terms between 1933 and 1945. The foreign aggressors he's talking about must be Nazi Germany and Japan. President Roosevelt had had polio and was unable to walk, but the press never showed pictures of him in his wheelchair. That's what journalism was like in 1941.) Two lone Japanese zeroes sink the yacht but are in turn shot down by two modern Navy fighters. One Japanese pilot is rescued.It would have made a fascinating episode of The Twilight Zone but the movie goes awry before too long. Katherine Ross and Charles Durning are the survivors of the strafed yacht. They're brought up by winch into the helo compartment. I'm sure glad you were out here, remarks Durning. At the time there were virtually no helicopters, just a few private toys held together with spars. And Durning is sitting in the spacious compartment of this big helicopter, being cared for by men in modern Navy uniforms, evidently oblivious to his surroundings. It's not until he's taken aboard the carrier that he activates what Ivan Pavlov called the orientation reflex. That is, he takes notice of what's around him.So does the resolute Japanese prisoner, who grabs a gun and some hostages and demands access to a radio. Clearly he wants to warn his fleet of the presence of the Nimitz. There is considerable concern over this by Douglas and the rest. Should they allow him to warn the Japanese attack force? Well -- if they gave it any thought, they probably would. What would be the consequence? The attack force of six aircraft carriers might try to bomb and torpedo the Nimitz but given the difference in technology they probably wouldn't do much damage, if any. OR, having been warned, Nagumo might realize that he now lacked surprise and might have turned the fleet around -- thus averting, for a while, America's entry into World War II.At any rate, I can't help wondering how this film went over in Japan, redintegrating, as it does, some of the anger and resentment of the war years. When two of our most advanced jet fighters down the two Zeros, the order is, Splash the two Zeroes, and the Navy aviators chuckle with joy. The triumphant music gets louder. You can almost hear a theater audience as they grit their teeth and shout, That's right -- kick some ASS! And when Douglas orders the Nimitz to prepare for battle, and we see the crew rushing around arming bombs while horns honk, drums pound out a march, trumpets blare, and the notes of the national anthem creep into the score, there is the same emotional charge. Douglas orders an air strike against the Japanese fleet but then recalls the flight. Damn, they're going to let the Japs do it again!, complains one of the aviators. The writing, the direction, and the score promote the kind of child-like enthusiasm that one finds at a high school football game. It's an appeal to some of our basest instincts.

That movie saw an experiment on board the US warship to try and make it invisible to radar. Of course it goes wrong and two crew members are sent into the future of 1984. In this time travel adventure the USS Nimitz is on training operations in the Pacific when a mysterious storm comes out of nowhere and sends the ship back to 1941.The casting is impressive with this old sci-fi, Martin Sheen is a civilian observer, a systems analyst who is on board for reasons unknown frankly. Charles Durning plays a fictitious senator back in 1941 and the epic Kirk Douglas is the USS Nimitz Commander. All three of these actors add much needed impetus to the project as lets be honest...this is total B-movie fluff. Although I still can't for the life of me work out why Sheen's character is required, and here lies one of the plot issues.In this movie the USS Nimitz was designed by an aged Mr. Tideman who we don't see. Now this chap has made sure that Sheen's character gets on board the Nimitz for its training run. The reason being because what happens on board the ship and in the past (when the ship gets there) will effect the future. You assume Sheen's character will obviously somehow effect someone or something that will cause a time ripple, but he doesn't as far as I could see. Sheen doesn't really do anything throughout the whole movie accept stand around and offer the odd bit of advice. The only thing I can think of is the fact that the Nimitz was delayed by two days waiting for Sheen's character to arrive and board (according to Douglas' character the Commander), by order of the mysterious Mr. Tideman. So maybe that delay was required so all the following events would be set in motion at the right time.Naturally time travel paradoxes may arise in a story like this and I'm pretty sure the main twist in the tale here doesn't work. Basically it turns out one of the officers on board the Nimitz is a younger Mr. Tideman who gets stranded back in 1941. Tideman helped design the Nimitz because he served on board her as an officer up until the point he gets stuck back in time. So it was the older Tideman back in 1980 who wanted Sheen's character to travel on the Nimitz for her training ops...although I don't get why as I already said Sheen does nothing.So here is my issue. Young Tideman goes back in time and gets stranded (in 1941), he then must pretty much relive his life through to the present of 1980. Thing is in the present of 1980 with Tideman now an old man, at some point many years earlier, another younger version of Tideman must be born so he can join the Navy, join the Nimitz and eventually go on the training ops mission back in time. So this would surely mean there would be two versions of Tideman living in the same time, is that possible? I'm sure the older version would know not to try and meet his younger self so maybe it would be OK?There is much that isn't really explained in the movie, whether that's because its left up to your own imagination or not I don't know. The mysterious storm is never explained, the fact it seems to be aware at one point because it tracks or homes in on the Nimitz when they try to outmaneuver it. The whole event is simply written off as a mystery or freak of nature. Also I noticed that when the Nimitz goes through the time portal, even jets that aren't on board her go through too. At the end there is an entire strike force of jets up in the air and nowhere near the Nimitz when the storm time portal thing catches the ship and they go back through to 1980. So even if these jets aren't on the ship and not even close to either the ship or the portal...they still go through? Is that because the ship goes through and they just materialise along with it? maybe they are foreign objects in time and time knows they don't belong there? Admittedly most of the run time is taken up by military prowess and military hardware porn, put it this way if you like big guns, jets, aircraft carriers, warships, old planes, helicopters, flybys etc...you're gonna have a field day. Its basically a US Navy recruitment campaign combined with a training video showing you all the cool fun stuff, life on a carrier and errr...all the cool fun stuff. You could also say it was a long homage and love letter to one of the USA's best supercarriers, one of the biggest warships around. A day in the life of the Navy at sea and how it runs. I can't deny it all looked very impressive though, very slick, very cool, it gives 'Top Gun' a good run for its money...and this was 1979! imagine what they're like today.Anyway back to the movie, it was fun, an enjoyable little Twilight Zone-esque escapade which I find agreeable on most days. I knew there would be problems along the way with this, you can kinda tell, but it doesn't detract from the fun too much.

As in all in all time travel movies the question of What if? is the heart of the movie. In Back to the Future, the question was What if you meet your parents when they were teenagers and alter them falling in love?, In Time after Time, What if Jack the Ripper stole HG Wells' machine and escaped ?, and so forth. In The Final Countdown, the What if? is, What if a 1979 air-craft carrier, fully armored, mysteriously found itself transported to Dec 6, 1941, intercepting the Japanese fleet headed for Pearl Harbor? Lets look at the good and the bad.The Good.First and foremost, the concept alone is the best thing going for this flick. The discussions about what to do are very well written and the unavoidable consequences for altering the past are played out very well. The acting is adequate but i really found Martin Sheen and Chales Durring to be the most convincing.The Bad.Despite a great idea and decent acting the movie shoots itself in the foot by not going all the way. The entire premise is that this lone carrier is sent back in time to intercept and defeat the attack on Pearl Harbor. The captain and the crew decide to do that very thing and just before they are about to attack they are thrown back to the future. It is such a major cop-out for the movie. I would have loved to have seen the ramifications of stopping the attack. Now i know that changing the past would be the wrong thing to do in most time travel movies. But, in this movie, Time itself is granting this opportunity. If the movie had let the carrier attack the Japanese fleet and then transported them back to the future leaving the open question, What will they find?, it would have been a great change. It is because of the cheap cop-out that really dismantles this film from something special to mere mediocrity. All in all, if you like time travel movies, its worth a glance but be prepared for a very weak pay-off at the end.

On December 7, 1980 the nuclear carrier USS Nimitz disappeared in the Pacific and reappeared December 7, 1941 ,the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour . The events go wrong , causing an USS naval battleship to disappear in Pacific Ocean by means of a warp time. The motley crew as Wing Commander Richard Owens (James Farentino) , Lasky (Martin Sheen), Cmdr. Dan (Ron O'Neal) commanded by Captain Matthew Yelland (Kirk Douglas) find themselves thrown into a temporary hole . Then they find in the past world of 1941 and they can change the course of history but also to generate a cataclysm that threatens to destroy it.This is a far-fetching but acceptable story about an U.S nuclear-powered aircraft carrier traveling forward in time to just to discover famous incidents and change the world. It is developed with intrigue, suspense , thrills and noisy action with interesting screenplay by Thomas Hunter. Familiar but satisfying and agreeable Sci-Fi yarn , including a surprisingly final . Just amusement enough to cover production gaps and some flaws. Fine special effects by the time and liking acting by the leads manage to keep this one afloat. Nice performance of Kirk Douglas as Captain Matthew who must face the ultimate decision , leave history intact or stop the known events . Good support cast as Charles Durning as the Senator, Soon-Tek Oh as a Japanese pilot , Ron O'Neal , among others and early appearance of Lloyd Kaufman , subsequently producer of B films with Troma Productions. Colorful cinematography by Victor J. Kemper and atmospheric , spectacular musical score by John Scott. The picture achieved big success at Box office and had ripoffs and imitations , being followed by ¨Philadelphia experiment¨ and inferior sequel titled ¨Philadelphia experiment II . The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Taylor. He was an actor and director as TV as cinema and an expert on adventures genre as ¨Adventures of Tom Sawyer¨ , Terror as ¨Damien  Omen 2¨ and science fiction as ¨Island of Dr. Moreau¨, ¨Escape from Planet of Apes¨, and of course ¨The final of countdown¨.

I expected it to be cheesy with some fairly ropey special effects... I was wrong, the story was good enough and what special effects there were were decent enough. The real highlight though was the lack of CGI, this means we get to see a wide range of real US Navy aircraft.The plot about the USS Nimitz, a modern nuclear powered US aircraft carrier, going through a strange storm which leaves it back in 1941 on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. A pair of the carrier's F-14s intercept and shoot down a pair of Japanese Zeroes which have strafed an American boat which happened to have a Senator on board. A rescue helicopter picks up the senator, his aide and one of the Japanese pilots, all of whom are shocked at the technology they see.The senator is adamant that they must warn Pearl of the imminent attack and the Japanese pilot; who has managed to grab a gun and take a hostage wants to warn his fleet. The captain and senior officers must decide whether they should intervene and change history or stay out of the fight and leave history to take its course.The action is pretty exciting and seeing all of those Navy jets would have been enough to get anybody who likes military aircraft watching. The acting was good enough with Kirk Douglas putting in a good performance as the captain of the Nimitz. I think it is a shame that there was less discussion about what the consequences of stopping the attack might be; both good and bad, still it was a pretty good film; a must see to any fan of military aircraft.

In addition to its being entertaining, enjoyed seeing Kirk Douglas, who although in his mid-60's, still looked vigorous and hale.The USS Nimitz is a nuclear aircraft carrier, sailing in the Pacific, on a routine assignment contemporary to the making of this film, in 1980. At the beginning, a civilian, played by Martin Sheen, has been assigned aboard as an observer for training exercises. His boss, a Mr. Tideman, observes his departure from a limo. Anyone who has ever heard the word foreshadow, knows that this scene will have some effect by the film's end, that Mr. Tideman's not being shown on-screen at this point is significant, and that the fact Sheen has not ever seen his boss face-to-face also portends something significant later, and is likely essential to the development of the plot. Sheen's position as an observer is of some minor disturbance to the ship's air wing commander, James Farentino, worrying about disruption to operations, but we know that there will be some sort of dramatic aspect in subsequent operations involving them with one another.The ship is destined to time travel, sailing through a vortex, a shrouded fog, which transports it from the present (1980) back to early December, 1941. They encounter Japanes aircraft, fighter craft in advance of the Pearl Harbor attack force, and all are initially nonplussed by their mint condition, whereas they should be 40-year-old relics. Captain Kirk (Douglas, not Spock's boss) dispatches three jet aircraft, one to Pearl, the others to fend-off the Japanese planes. The Japanese attack and sink the nearby yacht of an important U. S. Senator (Charles Durning), his assistant (Katherine Ross), her pet dog, and another companion. The Senator, Ross and the dog dive to safety, the other passenger is killed. This indicated hostility, and intent of same towards the naval vessel, necessitates the carrier's craft to blast the two enemies - one is destroyed by missile, the other shot down with bullets, allowing the pilot of the latter to survive (along with the two humans and one canine from the sunken yacht). The prisoner/Japanese pilot is rescued by a helicopter, and the Senator/Durning, his comely assistant and the cute doggy are rescued by another, and all taken on-board.There is a lot going on in this film. The plane sent to Pearl Harbor returns with photos. Farentino recognizes one is the same he has in-file for a book he is preparing - showing the port as it was, in-tact, just prior to the December 7th sneak attack. The Senator, an important, informed senior politico expert on all matters military, is obviously nonplussed by the jet aircraft and all other aspects of the carrier and everything else, beyond the contemporary hardware with which he is familiar.The crux of all these time travel stories, whether an inexpensive 22 minutes within a half-hour TV presentation, or an expensive, A-list big-screen offering like this one, presents the same dilemma -- whether to use the ability now at-hand to stifle some occurrence and save lives, etc., but alter the future in so doing? Might changing things - such as precluding the terrible events at Pearl Harbor on 12/7/41, make things worse than they became for future generations, or even in the relatively near term? Sheen even recalls previously reading about the Senator's loss, missing at sea, in 1941. If he survives now, he might well become the one who would succeed FDR in 1945, having supplanted Harry Truman on the party slate in 1944. What paths might he have taken differently from HST, towards using the A-bomb, ending the Pacific war, in Korea, etc., etc? All the while Kirk has to be the one to decide on the basic question regarding the impending Japanese squadrons, and the viewer knows that at some point the ship probably will return to present (at filming) time. But when? In the middle of what? To what avail?Suffice to say, in my opinion, this story has handled an often-used theme in a clever, engaging way, with fine performances. Also, the picture is just plain entertaining - something I think we sometimes overlook in our analyses.The end is clever, and the transportation of some folks back to the 40's, and their subsequent fates is done as logically as possible within science fiction. Without revealing the end, one 1980 character stays back in the 40's but reappears again (older) in the 80's. Another original 40's person also appears in the present at the end. And the doggy, who even if young and destined to a long life, would have originally made it at best to, say, 1954 or so, remains in the 1980's, is still young at the flick's end, and participates in the happy aspects of the story's conclusion "},{"Title":"What a fabulous movie!","Date":"26 January 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie was such a surprise the first time I saw it.

It's good in the same way you might find a Twinkie or a double-fudge brownie good; that is, it's a guilty pleasure.  You like it, but you know it probably isn't doing much for you.The film itself is little more than a wonderful montage of naval aviation. The implausible plot finds a modern nuclear aircraft carrier myseriously (and conveniently) transported in time to December 6, 1941 just a short hop from Pearl Harbor.  This turn of events sets the stage for the real point of the movie; many scenes of carrier flight operations featuring a triumphant musical score any time a piece of military hardware is on the screen.  One of the best scenes features a dogfight between American F-14's and Japanese Zeros.  The scene is great but let's face it, it has all the drama of a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Dr. Ruth.  Sure, she's a scrappy old broad and he hasn't fought in a while, but c'mon - it would be Iron Mike winning every round with a TKO in the 8th.  Bet on it.The film features very little in the way of exploration of their time travel predicament or the consequences of their actions.  Such notions are mentioned and forgotten in short order.  They would only distract the viewer from the great aviation scenes, anyway.  They debate whether or not to defend the US from what they know is about to happen and engage in a very brief debate about the consequences and that's it.  No one even thinks of flying one of those planes to Pearl Harbor (or Hickam Field, maybe) and talking to someone there.  If I were a soldier in 1941 and an F-14 landed in front of me, you can rest assured I would pay attention to whoever got out of it.The ending is every bit as implausible as the beginning.  I've never been a film student, but I dimly recall from my college humanities classes something called deus ex machina (God from a machine).  They used this contrivance in old Greek dramas.  They would weave a complex morality plot with no easy resolution; so they would simply have the gods (represented by a machine lowered onto the stage) swoop in and impose a neat and tidy ending.  This movie seems to be the modern incarnation of that ancient plot device.In summary, think of this movie as junk food for your brain.  If your looking for serious exploration of the paradoxes of time travel or the geopolitical consequences if Pearl Harbor turned out differently, then pass on this movie.  If you just want to be entertained by a naval aviation spectacle, then watch and enjoy it!

It has a cracking script, which resembles a feature length episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. It's basically The Philadelphia Experiment in reverse. Don Taylor was a good if not exactly innovative director but he does a great job in this, his final film. After Escape from the Planet of the Apes, this was Taylor's second time travel film, incidentally. It was made on a rather low budget but the fact that the Nimitz played itself meant that this is far from obvious. It has a great cast such as Kirk Douglas as the Nimitz's captain Matt Yelland, Martin Sheen as the civilian systems analyst Warren Lasky, Charles Durning as Senator Samuel S. Chapman (a shoo-in for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1944), James Farentino as Commander Dick Owens (an expert on the attack on Pearl Harbor) and, the only woman in the film, Katharine Ross as Chapman's assistant Laurel Scott.The film features several discussions of the ramifications of altering history by potentially either preventing the attack on Pearl Harbor from taking place or by using the Nimitz to aid the 1941 Navy vessels to defeat the Japanese but there is not as much done with this idea as there could have been. For instance, no one raises the issue of the impact that the US remaining neutral throughout the war would have on the timeline e.g. a very, very big and negative one. The flying scenes are all very impressive, which is hardly surprising considering that the Navy allowed the use of its planes for the film. Oddly enough, it was used as a recruiting tool but I don't know how effective the film was on that score! The brief scenes of the attack towards the end of the film are taken directly from the earlier Pearl Harbor film Tora! Tora! Tora!. I was able to recognise them immediately since I watched that film only last week.Overall, this is great fun if you don't take it too seriously.

Anyways, The Final Countdown is a movie that I had laying around on DVD for several years already, but I always delayed my viewing due to the incredibly grotesque and implausible time-traveling plot description. I need to be in a certain light-headed and tolerant mood to watch a film about an entire aircraft carrier (we're talking about a massive warship with a full-length flight deck here) that gets sucked trough a time-warp and ends up near Pearl Harbor on the 6th of December 1941, merely hours before the Japanese surprise attack that led the United Stated into World War II. Before properly realizing &#x96; and believing &#x96; what exactly happened, Captain Yelland and his crew have to decide whether or not they will prevent the attack and thus drastically alter the course of history. Admittedly, the elaboration of this crazed concept was a lot more realistic and compelling than I expected, but it does of course remain a hypothetical Sci-Fi movie. The script obviously features paradoxes that are big enough to fit a few more aircraft carriers and the climax *** additional spoiler alert *** is a rather cowardly letdown, since director Don Taylor and the four-headed crew of authors retreated from the change-history plot possibilities. Instead of coming up with a few courageous and innovative plot twists, they apparently preferred to use The Final Countdown as a publicity flick to promote the Navy! There's a lot of padding footage of planes taking off, cruising through the skies and landing on the impressive USS Nimitz. Perhaps the film crew was only allowed to use the ship if they included appealing and proudly patriotic images?

Douglas is solid as a rock in the lead; his company Bryna produced the picture. Katharine Ross provides a female presence to add just a little bit of romance to the plot. If one is a fan of the low budget, schlocky productions of the Troma company, they'll definitely note the presence here of Troma president Lloyd Kaufman, who's the associate producer, unit production manager, and a bit player.It's worth sticking with just for the twist ending, even if some viewers are able to predict it.Eight out of 10.

Kirk, James Farentino, a visitor Martin Sheen and Ron O'Neal, are perplexed and have to figure out what's happened. Then they face a momentous decision about what to do about it.The story is very clever and very captivating in its use of certain small things that create some delicious time travel quirks and tie-ins.The faults are a little too much film spent on airplanes taking off and landing and music that's too adulatory to the military might on display. The military rituals of command and action are written into the script too, but they play pretty well. It looks as if using the Nimitz was had only for a price of playing up to the navy. Another fault is a subplot involving a captured Japanese pilot that really doesn't connect to the main story.On the other hand Charles Durning is in fine form, as are Sheen and Farentino. Katherine Ross, well, she's in there. There are not a lot of special effects needed, but they are handled well.I've seen this one 3 times and it's still fresh. I definitely recommend it for sci-fi or time travel entertainment. There are no deep themes brought out or even characterizations, but Kirk and Sheen manage to keep things interesting. The cleverness of the time travel quirks carry this.

Wells' The Time Machine, comes to mind).When making the fateful decision to change history, or leave things as is, the Captain (Kirk Douglas) states This is a U.S. warship. Our job is to defend the United States of America against attack...past, present or future.If, like me, you are an avid follower of military aircraft, then you will love seeing all of the jets and helicopters that served aboard the Nimitz in the late 1970s - F-14 Tomcat, A-7 Corsair II, A-6 Intruder (various versions for attack, refueling and jamming of enemy radars), S-3 Viking Anti-Sub warfare, H-2 Hawkeye (airborne radar & communications), and the Sikorsky Sea King helo used for Search & Rescue and anti-sub warfare.One thing I wish the film did that was in the novel would have been to have more of the technical talk that Martin Sheen's character (Warren Lasky) used when explaining how the storm happened, and how the Captain and crew could figure it out using the technology available to them.Also, in the novel, there was much more graphic detail of what happened to the ship & her crew when they went through the storm the first time.The novel also gave a sense of closure to the Commander Owens / Richard Tideman saga that ended the film.It is for these reasons that I give the film 7 stars, instead of 8 or 9.

That is the question this intriguing science fiction yarn presents, in a highly imaginative, engaging, and intelligent way.

With a premise like that, you just can't fail. Stuck in 1941 with a crew of five thousand men and nearly one hundred aircraft, easily tracking the Japanese fleet as it nears its target, Douglas faces a dilemma - does he mess with time or does he sit back and watch history repeat itself? Others in the crew, including Martin Sheen, offer their own theories, and Charles Durning shows up as a 1941 era senator, obviously perplexed at what's going on. This may have turned into a snooze-fest, but I was glad that the plot zipped quickly along, with American jets and Jap zeroes going at it, and the capture of a Japanese pilot that turns very violent (this is supposed to be a PG, but this part had Robocop-level blood letting).

The Nimitz and its commander, Captain Yelland (Kirk Douglas) realize what's happened fairly quickly, and while not quite believing it are forced to make the inevitable decision - do they intervene? They find the Japanese strike force, so do they attack it? If they do (a 1980 aircraft carrier with fighter jets going against a 1941 Japanese fleet) they'll obviously change the entire course of history. Yelland is conflicted over what to do and the movie largely follows his decision making process.There are, of course, story lines added to make this more interesting I guess. I wasn't entirely clear on the need for the character of Lasky (Martin Sheen). In my opinion, he added little. Yes, he was inevitably connected to the end of the story (which was entirely too predictable to be interesting) but the character struck me as entirely superfluous. To add some extra historical tension, the Nimitz rescues a US Senator who's believed to be in the running to be Roosevelt's next running mate in 1944 and thus potentially the next president (Charles Durning) and his assistant (Katharine Ross), along with a Japanese pilot shot down in the only engagement between modern US forces and old Japanese forces.Basically, I thought this was all right, but not really any more than that, and for some reason all the way through I had the feeling that this was a made for TV movie (which I was surprised to discover that it wasn't.) 5/10 "},{"Title":"Decent time warp flick","Date":"6 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi","Review":" On the negative side, the repetitive musical score was very cheesy and was detrimental to the film.

Sheen, Farentino, Durning, Ross - all delivered great performances. The plot was silly, but they carried it off very well....one thing, though - the storm caused men on the USS Nimitz to writhe on the ground as they were transported in time - they clutched their ears and were in semi conscious agony. There is no way that a squadron of F15 fighter planes would have been transported through the storm from 1941 to 1980 unscathed.

In The final countdown, the base assumption is that a nuclear aircraft carrier is somehow transported back in time to just before Pearl Harbour. The plot line is developed from this impossible position - but doesn't actually make very much of the paradoxes that are part of the assumption.In fact, the plot appears in many ways to be merely an adjunct to a documentary on carrier operations the doc. is interesting in its own right, but take it away and the actual plot development is rather sparse.

One of the nice extras is a commentary track by the film's director of photography. He provides fascinating details about the actual shooting such as the fact that all the shipboard scenes were filmed on board the Nimitz during a brief layover and a week-long training exercise. The technical aspects of the DVD are well done.Some story elements may have been overlooked or perhaps altered in the editing. The Nimitz' strategic policy was initially nonintervention and self-preservation. The F-14's were ordered to shoot down the Zeros, not in reprisal for their attack on the yacht, but in order to stop them from finding the carrier with its armament-laden deck. The decision to engage the invading force came about only when attack was imminent. When the captain learned that the time vortex was actively pursuing the ship and escape was impossible, he recalled his men in order to avoid stranding them in time. The only time-altering consequence of the whole scenario was to deposit Commander Owens in a situation where he could affect the future. The reason for that action and the nature of the intelligence behind it is left to the imagination.If you enjoyed Final Countdown, check out the recent anime series Zipang. It's an alternate telling and role-reversal of this story. A modern Aegis vessel from the Japanese Self Defense Force is transported back to the Battle of Midway and presented with the opportunity to alter the outcome of that engagement. It's a well told story with realistic animation, unlike typical Saturday morning action cartoons.

Somehow Nimitz is taken back to 1941, just before Pearl Harbour battle. Now it is a super-weapon that can change history and alone destroy all the Japanese fleet.One interesting question is if it is possible to change history. The crew are soldiers and want to participate the battle. In movies such Back to the Future characters were able to change history, in more real, like Twelve Monkeys -- they were creating it. Is Nimitz able to win the battle that was lost? What would happen to people who lived then? With some senator, who is going to win presidential elections, but was missing after the battle? Will he survive it and lead his nation after the war? The main question is not will Nimitz finally go back to its time but will Nimitz join the battle. One does not think about future but about soldier's duty.The movie consists nice photo shots. The carrier itself, its planes, dogfights between Japanese motor-planes and modern F14.

The USS Nimitz, a nuclear powered supercarrier, is briefly thrown back in time to December 6, 1941, the day before Pearl Harbor.

It's wildly fantastical, often cheesy and in parts plain dumb, but I still feel affectionate towards it and probably always will. The USS Nimitz (not a very old carrier at the time the film was made) gets to go back to 6 December 1941, meet up with the Japanese fleet &#150; and wonder what to do about it. Do they bomb the kerblooey out of the Japanese attack and save Pearl Harbor, or do they sit on their hands and let history play out? You can probably work it out right now, but that's not the real heart of the film. Of course, if they had saved Pearl, we wouldn't have had Ben Affleck inflicted on us two years ago, but you can't have everything. And interestingly, if they had prevented the battleships from being destroyed, the post-war dominance of the American carriers might not have happened &#150; and there may have been no Nimitz anyway. Paradoxes galore. What The Final Countdown is all about is cheering for US Naval aviation, and the film delivers the rah-rah stuff in spades, to the accompaniment of some pretty corny music, but who cares. It's fun seeing two F-14s razzing all over a couple of Japanese Zeros, and I for one always let out a chuckle when Captain Yelland mutters little bastard as the Zero pilot is taken in for interrogation. The pacing is good, the whiz-bang-look-at-our-toys stuff works well, and the acting is well, adequate for the most part. Good to see Kirk Douglas as a suitably austere and gruff skipper, and Martin Sheen has a nice turn as the civilian analyst playing exposition fairy for most of the plot. James Farentino, Charles Durning and Katharine Ross round out the supporting cast, but the best actor of all is the USS Nimitz, which despite the hokey special effects, looks like the classy lady she always has been.

Hollywood in particular has thrived over the years with films dealing with this subject. Whether telling the story of an observer from a different time meddling with history, or simply telling a story where the change has already happened, Hollywood loves to do these what if stories.In 1980, a film was released called The Final Countdown. Considering the change in events if the attack on Pearl Harbour had been stopped, the film was cleverly made and with a solid cast and acting. Seeming perhaps slightly dated 20 years after it's release, The Final Countdown is still a solid film and well worth viewing.In the 1980s, the USS Nimitz, captained by Matthew Yelland (Kirk Douglas), is cruising 200 miles off Pearl Harbour. Suddenly a mysterious storm hits the ship and the crew are stunned to realise they are back in 1941. Now, with the Japanese air forces in their sights, Yelland, Commander Richard Owens (James Farentino) and civilian observer Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) must decide whether to change history for the better.Legends in their own rights, Douglas and Sheen is certainly an interesting pairing. Made 20 years after Douglas's most famous film (Spartacus) and only one year after Sheen's (Apocalypse Now), The Final Countdown has brought together two actors who nearly always perform superbly. Working as two parts of a great trio (Farentino being the third), these two actors are brilliant as the hardened captain wanting to take events one stage at a time, and the civilian who feels out of his depth.The Final Countdown however is a good film not just due to it's actors, but because it is a well written story which ticks along nicely until it's predictable conclusion. There's no denying that it's eventual solution regarding the attack feels slightly rushed, whilst the one deeply philosophical scene is also cut short, but as a complete piece, it is entertaining enough, and well thought out enough, to keep the audience interested.As entertainment, The Final Countdown really shouldn't be criticised. Telling a well written story and containing some great acting, it has all the makings of a traditional Hollywood blockbuster. Slightly dated compared with modern films, it might not have the special effects which recent ones do, but it has enough action and story in it to make you want to watch it numerous times. Well worth watching on a quiet Sunday afternoon.

The possibilities would be endless; there, of course, would be no Japanese surprise attack on the morning of Dec. 7, as the NIMITZ would have known, in advance, of the attack scheme and taken counter-measures to combat it. Also, the history books, as we know them now, would have undergone some drastic mind-boggling changes. Time travel, and its supposed existence, has also been a fascinating subject for movies, and this film plays that angle to the hilt.Kirk Douglas portrays Captain Yelland, the modern skipper of the aircraft carrier NIMITZ. On routine training mission outside Pearl Harbor, his command, and all the men, planes, equipment, etc., are mysteriously time-warped back to the same locality, but the date is December 6, 1941. Douglas,Martin Sheen, an expert from the Defense Dept., the other members of the crew, James Farentino, who is a Pearl Harbor historian as well as being a wing commander of a group of jet fighters, begin to realize the infinite possibilities of what they could do by stopping the Japanese attack in its early stages. However, they do encounter some 1941 era people, Katherine Ross, a secretary to a Senator Sam Chapman, played by Charles Durning. According to the history, as Farentino recounts it, Sen. Chapman disappears mysteriously during the attack, and would have been in line for the vice-presidency under FDR. Other matters complicate Captain Yelland's decision regarding the situation, and at the moment when matters could not get worse, the mysterious time-warp cloud is on the horizon in the path of the NIMITZ, and heading straight at them.Sci-fi at one of its better moments, a solid 8/10 "},{"Title":"Should rate higher IMHO","Date":"9 September 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This is one of those movies that the critics savaged but most people I ask who have seen it, liked it as opposed to the movies that the critics loved and most people despised.

I first saw it at the theater when it came out and I have seen it many times since then.  It's always as good as the first time.It is, of course, the tale of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz that goes through a strange storm and emerges on Dec. 6, 1941 a few hundred miles off Hawaii.  A modern nuclear aircraft carrier carries as much fire power as the whole Pacific fleet did in 1941.  The potential for ending WWII in the Pacific before it even really began was not lost on Kirk Douglas, the captain, and the other men on the Nimitz.  Their ethical and time paradox dilemmas and their meeting with some very startled inhabitants of the 1941 world makes the best time travel movie I have ever seen.  But it was also a positive military movie at a time when Vietnam agonizingly fresh in the American mind.  It is a tribute to the honor and integrity and professionalism of the men of the United States Navy.  As a lover of science fiction it was enjoyable, but as an American still hurting from Vietnam, it was a small step in a healing process that may never end.

I'd seen it before, but years ago. And afterwards, I was left feeling a little cheated.The DVD cover showed the Nimitz emerging from the storm, aircraft at the ready, and looking for trouble. What I actually got was much more thought provoking - the main thrust of this movie comes from the potential time paradoxes and not from the exhausts of the jet fighters. The action scenes were limited to one dogfight and a gunfight aboard ship, and the rest of the time it was kind of 'Should we, shouldn't we' as far as trying to stop the Japanese forces. None of these questions were particularly answered, although there are instances where the timeline appears to be trying to reassert itself. But then the cheesy ending goes and throws all that out, by letting you see the results of leaving someone there.As I said, disappointed and a little cheated.

After checking it for logical irregularities, I wondered how the sailor who was present at the moment of departure could at the same time and in the same place be present, old, in the black car under the name of Tideman !!! The scriptwriter seems to have overlooked this point. Apart from this the film holds well together, events happen in such way that the course of history is not altered (how could it be otherwise). The battle between the modern jet fighters and the old japanese warplanes was just far out, especially the look on the japanese pilots' faces ! The introduction of the dog which inadvertently travels through time and recognises its mistress at the end was a very good idea indeed !! One senses the `inevitability' of what is going to happen but this does not necessarily detract from the spectator's pleasure once he or she is engrossed in the chain of events. It's above all the reaction of the various characters in the face of a situation that they believe unimaginable is nevertheless true that gave me the most pleasure, especially Senator Chapman when he sees the year `1984' on part of the aircraft !! I felt the same pleasure when watching the protagonists of the film `Philadelphia Experiment' when they entered the desert café and saw the video machines, or when Malcolm MacDowell in `Time After Time' enters a MacDonald's restaurant in 1979 and starts `feeling' the plastic counter and ordering a `Big Mac' like the fellow in front of him !

I can assure you that the actual product is  much, much more. Though it sometimes has the look and feel of one of those low budget actioners, and the script is often less than what we are used to, the movie is quite well done with an extremely compelling and intriguing story.	Kirk Douglas (another indication that the movie has class) plays the captain of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, circa 1980. During routine patrolling of the Pacific Ocean off of Pearl Harbor, they come across an uncharted storm, concentrated in one small area. They enter the storm and once they do, they can't get out, until finally it passes. After nearly twenty hours of trying to contact Pearl Harbor, they build up the evidence suggesting they aren't in 1980 anymore, instead that they have taken a time portal back to 1941. December 6, the day before America entered the war.	Though that summary may sound cheesy, the movie actually handles the subject very well. The acting is dead-on, the music moves the scenes along perfectly and some of the aerial photography (one battle between two F-14's and two Zeroes) is unbelievable. Even the stock footage of the Nimitz, there is a lot of it, looks realistic. The entire film is like 'Top Gun' with a plot.	Since 'The Final Countdown' was made, there have been several forays into similar time-travel themes, such as the two 'Philadelphia Experiment' films. As far as the special effects go, they were probably state of the art twenty years ago when it was made, but it seems sort of dated now, still passable, but a bit dated.	The movie would play out very well on widescreen, there's a widescreen DVD version, but it's PAL only and in German, so for now you'll just have to put up with the grainy VHS version, if you're lucky enough to know a video store that has it. So the movie is highly recommended, by me, apparently by IMDb users, and by external reviewers. If you can get a copy of the movie, don't pass it up, or say 'Maybe another time', as you might not have another chance.

Kirk Douglas does a superb acting job in a movie that was done way past his prime as an actor.The only other comment I have to make is that I don't understand why this film is not available on tape. It just doesn't make any sense. I go into eBay and people are clawing to get VHS copies of this. This tape isn't cheap either; they usually sell between $20 - 30 on eBay and Amazon has used copies between $44.99 - 99.99. Why??? If this movie is so popular amongst the masses, why not market it on tape for public consumption? I wish someone could give me an answer to this enigmatic question.

But sooner Lasky learns that the senator had disappeared on that day and Capt. Matthew Yelland is planning to attack the Japanese.

The whole idea of trying to stop a historical event (in this case the bombing of pearl harbor) is something that has been done in fiction before. But it's always interested me. What if you had to opportunity to stop a great disaster, would you?The cast is great. You got Kirk Douglas as the gruff Captain, Martin Sheen as the Skipper whose the most intelligent member of the crew, James Farentino as the Wing Commander, Ron O'Neal as the other commander, Katherine Ross as a woman from 1945 who doesn't serve any real purpose until the end and seems to be their just so they can have a female in the film, Charles Durning as a senator from 1945 whose very important to the plot of the film. Lloyd Kaufman (who was an associate producer, back when he was still involved with mainstream films) also makes an unrecognizable appearance as a member of the crew. His character being named Kaufman in the credits was obviously intentional. He didn't really stand out though, so I didn't notice him on first viewing.The music by John Scott is great too. It gives me a heroic / war feel.The time vortex scene is cool, even if it does feel somewhat outdated by today's standards.Course this being a time travel film, means there are plot holes, but I was able to enjoy the film regardless.

Or Perhaps, alternatively, Hitler might have been cowed by the mysterious destruction of the Japanese fleet and might have pulled back from his advances into France and elsewhere. All interesting possible outcomes from preventing Pearl Harbor.Such suppositions have possible implications for today What if we had NOT gone into Iraq?

Nevertheless, it breathes the atmosphere of a classic spectacle thanks to good acting and competent execution.THE GOOD As mentioned above, the cast does its best with a script where often standard characters serve a script focusing on special effects, anachronism humour and deadlines to return to one's own time which are invariably endangered by an era-crossing romance. These elements can all be traced in FC. Martin Sheen is still in his younger years here and this movie is the definitive acknowledgement that his son is his spitting image, capable of arousing confusion on the screen. As a civilian on an I.A. assignment, he takes on the task of the nearly clairvoyant scientist who is instantly capable of explaining the facts on time travel and his company's current whenabouts. James Farentino (who I mixed up with amongst others James Booth in Zulu) as commander Owen is responsible for the romance. An elder Kirk Douglas portrays the stone-cold disbeliever, quite in accordance with his rank. Of the three, he gives the least enthousiastic performance. The unorthodox thing about these characters is that they evolve under influence of the circumstances in a believable way. Douglas' initial Cold War sceptism makes way for a daring battle plan, Sheen, maybe because KIA wasn't his favourite way of altering history for the benefit of the nation, grows weary of his time travel enthusiasm and Owen learns not to make as big a risk out of such alterings than he used to. They have a tendency to correct themselves in nasty ways to begin with, a few minutes of the movie which I'd forgotten about. All 3 they're realistic portrayals and people worth rooting for despite their differences. The movie points towards an inevitable direction anyway.THE BAD The pace is at times a bit too tight to my liking. A more elaborate take on the normal duties aboard the USS Nimitz, on the opposing parties in 1941 and the battle preparations might've been welcome. Also, senator Samuel Chapman is a neglectable issue in terms of alterings when compared to preventing the attack on Pearl Harbour and beyond. All we needed was a girl and a stubborn man. THE UGLY I guess a lot of people stumble over the special effects (obviously done with time-lapse photography and its brethren) but they didn't look that bad in 1980 given FC didn't have the budget for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. The ending is a mixed blessing too. It's cute for sure, but it lacks explanation and all in all... I WANTED TO SEE THE USS NIMITZ BATTLE THE Japanese FLEET !!! (sob) At least there was the fine Japanese fighter pilot running intelligence amok....did I mention that F-16's picking a duel with Mitsubishi Zero's and all the pieces of evidence for a time-warp of 40 years is a lot of fun ?

The entire cast delivers their lines like they are bored. Most dialog consists of realistic but dull carrier business (i.e. orders to launch and retrieve aircraft and the like). The rest is just ludicrously, laughably bad. Emotion is virtually absent. From just sitting and talking, to exchanges during death and gunfire, the mood is decidedly flat. You know when something is SUPPOSED to be exciting by the use of raised or hushed voices and possible profanity. Character development is nonexistent. Visual effects consist mostly of inter-cut shots of real aircraft doing their business so there's no problem with realism there, but there's almost no interaction between aircraft. All special visual effects (atmospheric to blood squibs) look very poor. The film's score is no better than the rest. It's often wildly at odds with the tone of what's happening, though that may not be the case if the tone weren't so flat.Perhaps this film's biggest downfall is that it completely sidesteps venturing into the territory it promises to tackle early on, and thus has no significant climax!I don't know what film those giving this high ratings were watching, but I know I've rarely seen such a universally pitiful film.
