Let me start by saying Anthony Hickox is a brilliant man. This movie was his first time as a writer and director and he did it perfectly. Going on to make a Warlock movie and a Hellraiser film, he has established himself (though still remains under-appreciated).The film stars the kid from Gremlins and his group of friends who encounter the guy from The Omen, who along with a midget and a Lurch-like butler manage a wax museum full of horrible characters. Dracula, the Marquis de Sade, a werewolf, the mummy, and nine other nasties. Well, the museum offers a portal to each of these horrible worlds -- but if you die in the portal, you die in real life and become part of the museum.This film is brilliant because of the perfect combination of horror and comedy. You will get spraying blood, mutilated flesh, and a dismembered hand that lives on its own (see Waxwork II for more on this and its connection to Evil Dead II). You will get a girl sexually aroused by being flogged (sado-masochism goes hand in hand with horror). But yet, it is funny. The midget is cute, one of the kids is just weird and you should hear the way Dracula says steak tartar or the scene where the AARP (old people) raid the place.I could complain about the really odd plot and lack of sense. I mean, there is a part where the origin of the museum is explained. Not only does this make little sense, but there is no reason the man telling the story should know anything about it. Then there is the bit about the sculptures needing relics from their real-life bodies to become alive. Yet, there are sculptures of The Fly, the Invisible Man, and a scene from a zombie film. These things never happened, so how can they have real relics? But you know what? It is so much fun, you just ignore things like this (especially compared to the complete nonsense plot of the sequel or House II...) Recommended? Heck yeah. Great comedy, great horror, great 80s film. Dana Ashbrook appears before the day of Twin Peaks. Oh, and the professor from Sliders is in it, too.My only concern is that allegedly the film was cut by the MPAA due to gore in the vampire sequence. I would love for that sequence to be put back together (and a director's commentary never hurts). This film would be even better with more blood.

When the major studios discovered back in the late Seventies that indie horror flicks were cheap to make or just buy outright and distribute, they started crankin' 'em out...by the DOZENS. Way back when, THE EXORCIST turned the faucet on. The movies that would launch long-term franchises filled the tub. HALLOWEEN. Friday THE 13th. A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. And then the tub started spilling over. CHILD'S PLAY. THE HITCHER. THE LOST BOYS. NEAR DARK. FRIGHT NIGHT. Every company, great and small, started looking for the next EXORCIST, ALIEN, JAWS...the next big thing that would make millions. Enter Vestron Video. Vestron had started out doing some of the first direct-to-video pictures ever made, discovering that the market was HUGE. So big, in fact, that they started a movie division, Vestron Pictures. Their strategy was simple make good (if not great) genre pics that would put asses in the seats, that they could then distribute through the video arm later on. One of Vestron Pictures' first releases was a little number called WAXWORK. The plot of the old horror classic MYSTERY IN THE WAX MUSEUM was such a tried and true staple, the studios kept falling back on it again and again, finding fresh ways to retell the story. WAXWORK took a little different approach from the straight-ahead versions, with a cast and a sensibility for horror that still screams Me Decade even today. Check out the victim's list Zach Galligan (GREMLINS.) Michelle Johnson (BLAME IT ON RIO.) Deborah Foreman (VALLEY GIRL). Dana Ashbrook (TWIN PEAKS). Miles O' Keefe (TARZAN THE APE MAN). Then you throw in vets like David Warner, Patrick McNee, J. Kenneth Campbell, John Rhys-Davies, tap Bob Keen (HELLRAISER) to do make up effects, and you have yourself an Eighties' classic!Like most films of the period, it starts off with a group of bored, young slacker-types looking for thrills, something...ANYTHING that would be a little more exciting than getting high, getting drunk, getting laid (well, ALMOST more exciting than that), and definitely more of a kick than going to college classes!They find it, alright - in the form of an invitation to a brand new kind of museum. And this one is not your garden-variety, Madame Tussaud's-wannabe. The wax figurines are so lifelike that the displays seem to draw you in...Well, okay, they DO draw you in. Here's the kicker the displays are dedicated to some of the most well-known figures in the history of horror Dracula. The Wolfman. The Mummy. The Marquis de Sade. Reenactments of their most horrible deeds as they drained blood, hacked and tore off limbs or crushed their helpless victims to death. Seeing the scenes gives patrons the feeling of being in the moment...but if they give in to the compulsion of stepping across the velvet rope around each display, they will find themselves living in that moment...FOR REAL.And here's the REALLY bad news...if the monsters in each display kill you in the 'waxwork dimension', you become a permanent part of the display...FOREVER. So once that happens, the situation couldn't get worse...could it?Oh, yeah! The proprietor of the museum has a darker agenda than just dispatching troublesome teens, as our heroes and victims discover with each person who 'disappears' into the museum. And seeing how that plan gets foiled is only part of the giggly, gory fun.Remember that I mentioned that Bob Keen was the effects guy on this? He got his start as a modeler for movies like STAR WARS, SUPERMAN and ALIEN, cutting his teeth as he worked up to projects like HELLRAISER and THE UNHOLY. But he really served up his calling card with HELLRAISER and with this movie. Gore-wise, this is where the retelling of the Wax Museum story gets more interesting...because thanks to Bob, the visuals go where they never had before.In a manner that would've made the suits at Universal flinch back in the Thirties, Keen and writer/director Anthony Hickox do away with the quaint violence that Famous Monsters used to wreak upon their poor victims. No camera pull-aways here, folks. Where somebody might only threaten to rip off your head and crap down your neck, these boogeymen take that threat to its most intense extremes. No CGI fakery, either. This was back-in-the-day where almost all the effects were practical, live and in-ya-face...the way we like it!Okay, so the clothes, the music, the casting and even the acting squarely establish this as what could be considered a period piece for horror, I guess. But like his colleagues David Schmoeller, Ted Nicolaou, Stuart Gordon and on occasion Charles Band himself, Hickox knows how to get the action going and keep it that way. This is one of those gems that might've slipped under your radar, but definitely worth seeking out, hunting down and dragging back home to mount in your DVD library.

Four friends enter a wax exhibit that seemingly just popped up over night in their neighbourhood, amidst a rash of disappearances of many of the townsfolk. ZACK GHALLIGAN heads off the cast as MARK, a rich boy who doesn't treat others as something he just stepped in (sadly his mother who treats him like a little kid, doesn't feel the same). Entering the museum with his friends, TONY, SARA, & snobby ex-girlfriend CHYNA for a midnight showing (although they are the only ones there). Upon arrival, they are greeted by an odd ball midget butler & a LURCH (From THE ADDAMS FAMILY) like servant & a charismatic English gentlemen named MR. LINCOLN (A wonderful performance by David WARNER). As each kid discovers, the wax exhibits are that of famous literary monsters. Some of which have victims in their throes of death & some that don't. Those that don't, can be accessed by a person who steps over the belt separating them from the exhibit, only for said person to wind up in whatever horror tale, the exhibit is depicting. When Tony & Chyna go missing & never return home, Mark & Sara contact the police. The detective on the case scoffs at Marks explanation that they may have been killed & turned into wax figures at the museum, but soon changes his mind, when he realizes that a lot of the victims in the missing persons photos, bear a striking resemblance to the victims in the wax exhibits. When both he & his partner then go missing, Mark & Sara then visit his wheel chair bound Uncle (Played wonderfully by PATRICK MACNEE) a former hunter of the supernatural, who has a chilling explanation about the history of the museum's owner & what may happen, if each exhibit is soon fitted with a victim, unless Mark & Sara can burn down the WaxWorks museum. They then try to prevent an eventual apocalypse by breaking in & doing so, but as they soon find out, getting into the museum after closing hours to perform such a deed is easy, pulling it off will be impossible. When the creatures & their now evil victims rise out of their worlds, the war between good & evil is truly on, but only one side can walk out.I loved WAXWORK! it's easily one of my all time favourite horror movies! Even when I was a little kid, I rented this movie quiet a lot & it still never bores me, even though I've seen it countless times. WAXWORK is a film made with heart & it shows. It's a horror film for horror fans, by horror fans & really that's the best kind of horror film any fan can ask for. It's a very imaginative & fun piece of work. The performances are great & the special effects are tremendous (Courtesy of HELLRAISER'S own BOB KEEN!). Director ANTHONY HICKOX turned out to be a really good director & the film is a very impressive debut. Hickox manages to mount a considerable amount of tension, suspense & even some creepy atmosphere throughout the film. The kills are disgusting, with plenty of blood shot all over the place, squashed & pulled off heads etc. Hickox clearly had a ball writing the script & it shows! The film is littered with various pokes at famous horror films & famous movie monsters, such as THE MUTATED BABY (IT'S ALIVE) AUBREY (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER, THE MUMMY (This mummy is no skinny mummy either! he's massive & very scary!) THE WOLFMAN (You have to see this thing, it's scary & make the werewolves in THE HOWLING look like poodles!) Dracula & his BRIDES, an AXE MURDER, THE INVISIBLE MAN, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, The GOLEM, A WITCH, JACK THE RIPPER, a VOODDOO PRIEST, the MARQUIS DE SADE, CIRCUS FREAK, even DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE! The set designs are really good & well captured. Amazingly accurate & professional looking, considering the films low budget & the score changes depending on which monster or era were in & is done in the classical scores of the famous UNIVERSAL horror movie scores of the 30's/40's. Despite it's subject matter, WAXWORK also has some laugh out loud moments & dialogue. My favourite being the one where Mr. Lincoln is showing a jealous football jock (who has come in to look for his missing girlfriend) a sculpture of the PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, with the Jock saying how much he loved the movie. Mr. Lincoln looks at him bewildered & says They made a movie about the Phantom Of The Opera? & after they chat a bit more, Lincoln pushes him through into the Phantoms world, where he then re-appears as a wax victims. Lincoln then walks away & says They'll make a movie about anything these days! Hysterical!Look at the top window in Dracula's castle as the heroine is coming down for dinner, it's in the shape of a pentagram. All in all, I highly recommend WAXWORK to any genre fan, it's the perfect type of horror film, that you can gather a bunch of friends together & watch. As the original VHS box art stated WAXWORK is more fun than a barrel of mummies!

But people watch them because, well, they can be fun. And that's just what this is. Nice, neat fun.It's especially impressive considering it's from a first-time writer/director, Anthony Hickox, who later went on to make decent werewolf TV movie Full Eclipse in 1993. Here he gives his own homage to a wide variety of horror movies. You've got your werewolf movie (the very first waxwork, incidentally), your vampire movie, mummies, zombies and an trashy period piece about the Marquis de Sade ... all of these are in waxwork museum along with brief appearances from aliens, Jack the Ripper and more.At first I expected it just to be a Dr Terror's House of Horror style piece with six different stories involved, but it turns out the film has more than enough original ideas to keep itself going. It all ends with every waxwork piece in the place coming to life for a final battle. Which is nice. The actors playing the teenagers all give fairly decent, entertaining performances and you have notable cameos from the likes of Miles O'Keeffe, John Rhys-Davies (as the werewolf), David Warner and Patrick Macnee (who was in The Howling). The script is pretty well structured and very little about the storyline is disappointing.All in all, this is among the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while, and I'd recommend it if you're after an ninety minutes of light-hearted, slightly twisted enjoyment.

Well, that is the premise of the film, but don't let it deter you from some good solid fun.  The plot is at best swiss cheese-like, but the film has style and creativity to make up for its shortcomings.  Most importantly the film is loaded with generous doses of humour throughout.  David Warner plays the owner of the museum and, like almost all of his performances, is a joy to watch as he slightly hams his way through this film.  Some of his lines are the most memorable, particularly as he talks to a jock about his wax creations, staring at a representation of The Phantom of the Opera saying, They will make a movie out of anything, having just heard that it had been filmed multiple times.  The rest of the cast is adequate.  Zach Galligan gives his mediocre best in the male lead, but two stunning beauties supply something to visually feast on despite their lack of acting breadth.  Michelle Johnson and Deborah Foreman do their level best to entertain.  The film is an obvious homage to the horror genre with all kinds of visual allusions to former horror films.  Anthony Hickox, the director, creates a fun horror film that I think his father Douglas Hickox, the director of my personal favorite horror film Theater of Blood with Vincent Price, would certainly have been proud of for its ability to mix chills with fun.  The film also has a nice cameo by Patrick Macnee, the old avenger himself.  Two minor flaws for me are the ending, which is somewhat too forced, and the bloodletting which may be a tad overdone at times.  Notwithstanding this criticism, one of my favorite scenes in the film is the one where the man who came to Dracula's dinner table(albeit minus much of his leg)agonizes in pain as he is prodded, poked, chewed, etc.. whilst a fight is going on around him.  A fun, fun film.

A small group of spoiled teens (and one nice girl) go into a mysterious wax museum after hours and each succumb to a different, and dangerous, display. John Rhys Davies (long before his now famous Gimli the Dwarf days) is here as a tortured, dramatic werewolf. Miles O'Keefe (whom hardcore MST3K fans will have no trouble recognizing) is a hair product dependent Count Dracula, who seduces the rich-bitch of the group into a nasty, bloody, gross-out dinner party. The Nice Girl (Deborah Foreman) is drawn into the S&M world of The Marquis De Sade (as played by the too seldom seen J.

Once all of the displays are filled, the characters within are unleashed, and it becomes a war within the wax museum as the remaining heroes must now battle the wax monsters and their transformed friends. All in all, this plays more like a comedy than a horror film, but the violence, when it appears, is so over-the-top that splatter fans won't be too disappointed.Followed by a pretty good sequel filled with numerous references to classic horror.

It has a clever, original story, memorable monsters and the lovely, talented Deborah Foreman as the leading lady. Really, what else could you possibly need in a film?The plot starts out simply enough six college seniors get invited to attend a late-night showing of the exhibits in a new waxworks building. But the characters in each of the displays are much more lifelike than they seem and when you step past the railing into the displays, you're taken into an illusionary world where the characters live, breathe... and kill.Pretty creepy, huh?Among the main cast members are Zach Galligan as Mark, Foreman as Sarah, David Warner as the Waxwork's owner Mr. David Lincoln, Dana Ashbrook as Tony, Michelle Johnson as Mark's ex-girlfriend China, Miles O'Keeffe as Count Dracula (or, as he's known as in this film, The Count), John Rhys-Davies as a werewolf, J. Kenneth Campbell as the Marquis de Sade and Patrick Macnee as Sir Wilfred, Mark's godfather. While Ashbrook and Macnee give good performances with their roles, it is Foreman and Warner who give the best performances. Galligan, though, gives as good wooden acting as any actor in the modern day Star Wars prequel films.Among the many good moments in the film, we get a few good one-liners in the mostly serious horror flick, good acting, a clever plot, likable characters and a truly frightening, though brief, black-and-white sequence with zombies! The musical score by Roger Bellon is also especially impressive for such a B-budgeted horror movie (particularly the main theme and the Mark and Sarah theme which is heard twice, when Mark is with Sarah outside her apartment and then when Mark takes Sarah's hand in the de Sade exhibit and leaves the display with her).Of the bad parts, we get some less-than-impressive cardboard sets, a werewolf that looks like a Muppet on steroids, lipstick-looking lashes on Sarah's back when she is whipped in the Marquis display (and the mentioned injuries curiously disappear when she leaves the display) and plot holes big enough to drive cars through. For example, the Marquis display hypnotizes Sarah when she stares at it and steps inside of it, but the others do not get hypnotized by their displays. Also, some gore is unnecessary (do we really need to see a hunter being torn in half by a werewolf?).Still, despite its flaws, Waxwork is a wonderful horror film that scares as much as it entertains. It may not be that scary by today's standards, but it goes well with popcorn and soda. So, dim the lights (if you dare) and enjoy watching this fine, lesser-known horror film.Would you like a closer look?

Zach Gilligan makes for a likable hero as nice rich guy Mark, Deborah Foreman is her usual adorable self as sweet virginal innocent Sarah, the foxy Michelle Johnson burns up the screen as the brash China, and Miles O'Keeffe projects a potently brooding sexuality as a suave Dracula. The scene with the Marquis De Sade (splendidly played with lip-smacking wicked relish by J.

Seasoned vets David Warner as the waxwork's sarcastic owner, Patrick Macnee as jolly crippled eccentric Sir Wilfred, and John Rhys-Davies as a tormented werewolf give the picture an extra buzzing energy and a sense of true class.

A delicious David Warner plays an evil waxworks owner with very special displays - they draw people in, the people are taken back in time, get killed, and then become a permanent part of the displays. The displays feature such classic fictional and historic monsters as a werewolf, Count Dracula (Miles O'Keeffe), a mummy, a group of zombies, the Marquis de Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell), Audrey II, etc. Warner is all about destroying the world here, because, as he puts it, somebody's got to do it. Among the heroic characters who catch on to his scheme are Gremlins star Zach Galligan as Mark and '80s sweetie Deborah Foreman as Sarah, who worked again with Hickox on Sundown The Vampire in Retreat. Fortunately, Mark has an ally in his fight against evil, his godfather Sir Wilfred, or Wilfie if you prefer, (ever delightful Patrick Macnee), who joins in the final big battle with a tricked out wheelchair. The movie is good fun, from start to finish; it's spirited entertainment that's nicely realized visually with fine production design (by Gianni Quaranta), costumes (by Leonard Pollack), and cinematography (by Gerry Lively). In true Night of the Living Dead tradition, the zombie sequence is in black & white, which only adds to the appeal. A good supporting cast also features Michelle Johnson (Blame It on Rio), Dana Ashbrook ('Twin Peaks'), Clare Carey ('Coach'), Charles McCaughan as the exasperated detective, and a too briefly seen John Rhys- Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark) as the human incarnation of the werewolf. True enough that Galligan isn't playing the most engaging or likable hero here, but Foreman more than makes up for that with her sunny presence. O'Keeffe is of course stiff as always, but Warner and Campbell are great villains. Hickox gets things off to a highly amusing start with an unlikely choice of music for the opening pre-credits bit, and keeps things interesting and entertaining. When the final battle takes place, with Sir Wilfred and his associates taking on their formidable opponents, the results are too hard to resist. Makeup effects are by the talented Bob Keen (Dog Soldiers, Hellraiser, Candyman) and his Image Animation company, and are generally pretty good. By the time this movie is over, it literally brings the house down, and while it could have used a little bit of tightening, it still manages not to overstay its welcome, and has some nice moments along the way. Please note that director Hickox appears in a small role as the depraved English prince. Followed by Waxwork II Lost in Time in 1992. Seven out of 10.

During the mummy scene they play the Swan Lake theme song. When they played it, I figured that it is the right kind of music for that type of scene. But what they play during the closing credits is a real surprise.

His directorial debut, Waxwork, features a variety of impressive horror vignettes based on his favourite scary movies; these are loosely linked together by a spectacularly scrappy (but still pretty fun) plot about a creepy wax museum curator (played by David Warner) who intends to bring his exhibits to life by luring victims into the supernatural displays.The final few victims required to complete this evil plan are a group of happy-go-lucky teens who are invited for a private viewing at the museum; one by one, they step over the rope barriers, only to find themselves becoming characters within the display.This fun setup allows Hickox the opportunity to have loads of fun paying homage to several classic horror movies of old, and the novice director definitely rises to the challenge, successfully mimicking both the atmosphere and style of each there's a great werewolf vignette starring John Rhys-Davies; a lavish and very gory Gothic vampire chapter featuring busty blonde Michelle Johnson; a mummy tale that also features quite a bit of bloodletting; some silly black and white zombie mayhem with Gremlins' Zach Galligan; and a deliciously erotic episode in which a sweaty and very appreciative Deborah Foreman is whipped by the Marquis De Sade (as the Marquis puts it, 'What a slut she is').Throw in an evil dwarf, a giant, and some bonkers action at the end of the film with a wheelchair-bound Patrick Macnee and pals kicking monster ass, and what you have is a very daft piece of popcorn horror that shouldn't really work, but does.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

Along with two friends, Mark Loftmore (Zach Galligan) & Tony (Dana Ashbrook) they decide to give it a go. Once there a strange midget butler named Hans (Mihaly 'Michu' Meszaros) answers the door, invites them in & says they can take a look around the waxwork models all of which depict various monsters including, Count Dracula (Miles O'Keeffe), an Egyptian Mummy (Paul Badger), the Marquis De Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell), a Werewolf (John Rhys-Davis), a circus freak, zombies & aliens. The four split up & have a walk around, only Mark & Sarah leave the waxwork as Tony & China are nowhere to be found. The following day & Mark becomes worried when no word is heard from either, he contacts the police & Inspector Roberts (Charles McCaughan) but isn't taken seriously. Mark does a little digging & discovers that Lincoln has in fact sold his soul to the devil & intends to resurrect his exhibits & spread their evil throughout the world, unless Mark & Sarah can stop him...This American German co-production was written & directed by Anthony Hickox, who also has a small role in the film as the Prince in the Marquis De Sade segment, & I personally think Waxwork is a fun & original horror film. The script doesn't take itself too seriously, moves along at a nice pace & pays homage to a whole host of horror films & monsters, Dracula, Frankenstein, Alien, a demonic baby, a deformed snake creature, the Mummy, the Phanton of the Opera, Werewolves, a man eating plant, Jack the Ripper, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, flesh eating zombies, the Marquis De Sade &, of course, the wraparound story about using real people in wax exhibits. All of these monsters can be traced to other classic horror films, I also really liked the mini films within the overall film. The idea that once you step into one of the exhibits you are transported to that particular location. From the log cabin & spooky woods of the Wewrewolf segment to the huge Gothic castle featuring Count Dracula. From the ancient Egyptian tomb & the Mummy to the the graveyard & the zombie attack even presented in black & white (just to add that extra realistic touch to the homage). Some of the dialogue is a bit annoying especially all the boyfriend/girlfriend rubbish that populates much of the first half of Waxwork. The character's are thin & the final battle between good & evil feels very out of place & cartoonish especially when Patrick Macnee turns up in an armoured wheelchair although it reminded me of peasant villagers wielding pitchforks, yet another homage?Director Hickox films with competence & even manages to bring a little style to it. The gore is plentiful, someone is ripped in half, a sliced up leg, exploding heads, Vampire staking with gallons of blood spraying everywhere, impaling, squashed heads, beatings, severed hands & all sorts of monsters. Apparently special make-up effects man Bob Keen spent 18 hours a day for eight weeks working on them, the results are mixed with some very impressive ones like the cool Mummy & gory Vampire sequence while other's are less so like the flying rubber bat & some of the minor monsters.Technically Waxwork is solid & is well made throughout & I especially liked the catchy cool sounding music. However the burning waxworks at the end looks well fake. The acting is variable, some good some not so good but this adds to the fun rather than distracts & generally speaking it's not too bad.Waxwok is an original, fun & entertaining horror film that I enjoyed. It's different enough to stand out in a world of soulless clichéd copycats & any horror fans will feel instantly at home with all the lovable homages of our favourite films that Hickox includes. Despite a few problems with the script & one or two silly special effect's I still highly recommend Waxwork, surely one of the best horror's to come out of the sequel driven 80's. Definitely worth a watch. Several years later a sequel Waxwork II Lost in Time (1992) was made.

Great cast with some top notch British actors, the great David Warner, Steed himself Patrick McNee (in a camouflaged wheelchair!) and John Rhys Davies. The special effects now seem pretty lame but everyone seems to be having such a good time it really doesn't seem to matter at all.I wonder if Joss Whedon ever saw this? The final scenes with the monsters released seems very reminiscent of the final scenes of 'Cabin in the Woods'? We have a very Buffy like heroine fighting vamps and a very Angelus like villain (and indeed the actor who plays The Marquis de Sade plays Angel's father). Of course halfway through this film stops being a Fright Night style horror comedy and takes a 90 degree turn Meridian/Phantoms style into some fairly outrageous porn. We have the sexy bad girl surrendering herself to Dracula in a scene that must have had a million goth fetishists drooling through their black makeup (she certainly 'gives good neck'). If that wasn't enough we then have the good girl who isn't quite sure what she want's from her boyfriend? Turns out what she wants is to be chained up and whipped by the Marquis de Sade, orgasming like crazy, begging him not to stop or let the hero rescue her! And you thought the poster for 'The Entity' marked the death of feminism? Of course this was the era of the New Romantics so men with long hair, puffy shirts and posh accents were very much in vogue at the time. One point of order, the Marquis de Sade was a real person from the 18th century and was famous for his outrageous sexual escapades and love of inflicting physical pain on his partners. However in real life he was French, never killed anyone or even inflicted real injury upon them and was never considered evil. The term 'sadism' is derived from him. Ironically de Sade survived the French Revolution which killed so many of his contemporary aristocrats because he was in an insane asylum at the time due to his perverted exploits and what were regarded at the time as obscene publications on sexual matters.All told it's a very fun film, I'd love to see the sequel and surely it must be ready for a remake with some more convincing special effects.

It just seems to have the right mix&the cheese while certainly present,is not done to that annoyingly childish 'over the top' level like newer movies do too often. Plus,there are some nice tributes to some classic characters,real&fictional. Everything from a Jack The Ripper-like character,to a suave 'Dracula'&his pretty,hungry brides. And of course,Mr. S&M himself,the Marquis De Sade,who ironically gets the virgin of the group visiting the waxwork museum,into chains&she finds she likes it,quite a bit.(; Some nitpickers may loathe the few plot gaps there are,but since the movie is so well done,you hardly notice them,IMO.

But not a classic 80s cult teen film","Date":"19 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" Admittedly I barely got through the latter half of this, before temptation dared me to sit it out to the end. Darned it. Definitely not Galligan's, Johnson's, Foreman's or even Warner's better work. But I blame that on the bad scripting, the horrible directing, the rather lazy production technique. And Lord knows, I have long respected and admired David Warner's work. Gifted villain is he, especially opposite his classic Jack the Ripper icon, opposite Malcolm McDowell in 'Time after time'. And certainly, one of the finer, solid English talents of our century. Thankfully his talent wasn't entirely wasted in this. He was allotted some grandeur evil moments; similar to the setup of Vincent Price's classic 'House of Wax'. Most inevitably, a few of the latter scenes curiously depicted those classic scenes,like the vat room and the staircase.This film certainly started out decently, but some of the pacing was a tad slow. By the time the kids actually step inside the 'wax museum', and then walk around the exhibits, much just turns goofy or mindless from thereon. Eventually action becomes rather boorish. The special effects are mediocre if that, most of the period actors can barely act a wink, and the editing is just awful. Several of the slasher-gore action shots get goofy or make zero sense (or out of sequence), and the ending 'battle' scene between the 'monsters' and the good guys is laughable. Perhaps this was intended to be a teen suspense comedy-drama. And it almost held the same quality humor as the Evil-dead series. However, with the awkward pacing, much of the intended visual effects fell either flat or victim to bad editing.

There's a few famous faces popping up here and there, a good dose of quality throughout, and the direction has the feel that it was done by someone who actually cared.

Do your hair in a comb-over then when two teenage schoolgirls pass by, invite them to your midnight show at a waxwork museum that's located in your average suburban street. Don't worry, they won't call the police on you - amazingly, they'll show up (and even bring their friends!).Again, that was another aspect I didn't like. The teens enter the wax museum and end up being picked off one by one in a different 'horror setting.' But, bear with it, there is a story somewhere in there.However, I stuck with it and I'm glad that I did. It's no classic, but it was silly and entertaining - which is all I ever expect from a horror movie. It wasn't that horrific, but it had plenty of rubber monsters being impaled on things (hey, it was made in the eighties after all - what do you expect!?) which is all most people want from their horror.

The proprietor offers them a midnight viewing for them and 4 of their friends. When the go, they find out that the waxworks are not quite what they seem. It is a macabre looking place where people don't always leave.The story was actually not too bad. I like the idea of the time travel and the victims turning to wax. When the victims step into the compound of the wax figures, they get transported into the time of the wax figures and have to play out the scene, but generally that ends in their deaths and they end up as wax figures in the display. The effects were terrible, even for its time. This film was made in 1988. I know the effects were nowhere near as good back then as they are now, but Gremlins was made in 1984 and the effects on that were far superior. The wax figures were clearly people dressed up&#x85; and at times you could even see them moving slightly... It did contribute to the comedy of the film though.The acting was terrible from everyone&#x85; I am not sure if that was done on purpose or if they intended to be convincing, but wither way it was bad. The movie stars Zach Galligan. I think Zach is a good actor. He was very convincing in Gremlins, but this is weak. His acting could not be more wooden. All of the other actors were just as bad too. Other cast members were Deborah Foreman, David Warner and Michelle Johnson.The best character in this film was the servant that opens the door. He is such a brilliant character and the funniest guy in the film. He was played by Mihaly 'Michu' Meszaros. He is mostly famous for playing the alien Alf in the classic TV series.I thought this was going to be a serious horror film, but it was clearly made tongue in cheek.

Genre director / writer Anthony Hickox makes his debut with the morbidly tongue-in-cheek horror Waxwork, which is a very silly, if gimmicky shocker with some impressively creative scenarios like when our heroine (Zach Galligan) finds himself transported into the black and white world of Night of the Living Dead. Mark and a group of friends pay a midnight visit to a strange waxwork museum which has opened up in their neighbourhood overnight. The museum if filled with horrific displays of classic monsters; Dracula, the Wolf man, The Mummy, Phantom of the Opera and so son. Before they know it they find themselves drawn into the displays and becoming apart of that world and also possibly a victim. The concept is ambitious and downright inventive (in how it brings it's monsters alive and breaking the narrative into abrupt segments), but what occurs is conventional and there's a real uneven tone that turns what could have been disturbing into a ridiculous, eccentric and stupid outing that caps it off with a cheesy climatic showdown. It doesn't hold back, especially on the blood and gruel. It's vigorous in details and somewhat cruel. Hammy acting by most (led by David Warner and Patrick Macnee), but Zach Galligan and Deborah Foreman were agreeable with Michelle Johnson and Dana Ashbrook rounding off the cast. Also look out for Miles O'Keefe and John Rhys-Davies in bit parts. In all a fun cast working with a smarting, if smug script filled with references, self- parody and goofiness. Where the highpoint arrives from is the use of colourful make-up FX, waxwork designs and stylised visuals despite its limited scope. The project feels like a labour of love for Hickox. Someone who enjoys old classics of the genre in reviving them to post- modern times in Waxworks. This isn't my idea of fun.

I thought the film kicked all kinds of butt, and I remember filling out the little comment card at the end of the show (What did you like about the movie? What didn't you like?) raving about the makeup and gore effects, and I probably told them that the blonde who played China was freakin' hot or words to that effect. (I have always wondered if that comment got back to her. Some geek in Jersey thought you were hot, babe.) I don't recall if Waxwork ever got a legitimate theatrical release after that test screening, but when I rented it on VHS some time later, I was dismayed to find out that much of the kick ass blood and gore shots that I'd grooved on at the free preview had been edited. I am, however, happy to report that the version of Waxwork on the double feature DVD released by Artisan Entertainment appears to be that original, uncut version that I saw many years ago. (Though both films are in fullscreen, not widescreen...SIGH! I guess you can't have everything...) End of commercial. Okay then!! Waxwork is a mostly forgotten lil' gem of '80s horror comedy. The plot is pretty simplistic in a nutshell, Zach Galligan of Gremlins fame and a bunch of his fellow spoiled, rich California friends get invited to a preview showing at a soon-to-be opened wax museum in their town, only to find when they arrive that they're destined to become part of the various sculptures. The waxworks of such famed evil doers as the Marquis De Sade, Jack the Ripper, Dracula, etc., etc. are actually portals to other dimensions, where the young cannon fodder becomes trapped as part of some sorta convoluted voodoo worshipping plot to unleash Evil on Earth and bring around the End of All Things, or something like that. So the story's ridiculous, but the various set pieces and segments featuring the Waxwork characters are like a sampler platter of some of horror's greatest moments, particularly the Werewolf segment and the scene set in a den of vampires (where blood literally paints the walls!!!). All Galligan cares about is rescuing his virginal, never-had-it-but-really-wants-to love interest from the grip of the Marquis De Sade, and by the time his godfather (Patrick MacNee of The Avengers no less!) and his merry band of British supernatural fighters arrive to save the day, you're either gonna be laughing your head off or you're going to be saying I hate this movie. I personally would've preferred it to lean harder on the horror end and less on the comedy but when Waxwork gets nasty (as in the aforementioned Werewolf and Vampire scenes), it provides a decent amount of shocks and some killer old-school creature and gore FX. First time writer/director Anthony Hickox has become a genre veteran, having gone from Waxwork to films like the underrated Full Eclipse, Hellraiser III Hell on Earth, and Warlock The Armageddon to name just a few. Perhaps Waxwork is still a little rough around the edges but it shows that even at this early stage in his directing career, Hickox already had an eye for cool set pieces, interesting staging, and of course plenty of bloody action. Waxwork is an entertaining little time capsule that should bring a smile to the face of any '80s horror fan. They really don't make'em like this anymore.

Looking through the exhibits at the behest of David Lincoln, (David Warner) owner of the site, they all decide to look into a specific wax exhibit, not knowing they are crossing over into the world of the exhibit through a spell around the exhibits, and they come into contact with monsters from the past, as well as real historical figures that have tortured mankind for centuries. Not knowing that they are in their worlds and figuring on it being just a dream, they never realize the dangers that lurk being in contact with such monsters as Count Dracula, (Miles O'Keefe) the Werewolf, (John Rhys-Davies) and The Marquis de Sade, (J. Kenneth Campbell) among others throughout history. When those that never entered realize that they're missing, they go back and find out what has happened, vowing to stop it before others go missing.The Good News There's not too much wrong here, and there's plenty to like. The fact that this one is so enjoyable from the raucous display of cheese in the film. From the incredible storyline to have an excuse to have all the different creatures come out, and the different amount of creatures on display in here is simply spectacular. From the werewolf to Count Dracula to the mummy and much, much more, there's no shortage of monsters in here, and that each one is taken up with a single segment is what preserves their fear, since it's just a stand-alone moment that isn't connected with what happens later other than the outcome. These are just packed with cheesy goodness, and are just a lot of fun to watch. There's also a large amount of rather fun action present in here, with most of the encounters with the creatures coming through pretty well, with the werewolf encounter being rather creepy and coming in with a spectacular confrontation with the creature, the Dracula version containing some wonderful scenes down in the basement dungeon, an encounter with a mummy has some great fun to it, the Marquis de Sade entry having some nice sleaze through a whipping scene to keep it fun, and then there's the full-on wonderfulness of the finale. This is just too exciting and energetic to keep track of, containing so much joy and wonderment that it's a real shame it's hard to track of. This one has so much excitement and action that it's impossible to keep track of it all, but there's fist-fights, stabbings, impaling, brawls and much, much more within the framework of the scene. With a giant fire brought into the fray and a ton of blood and gore unleashed, there's just no stopping the fun in here. The gore in here is also really great, with a literal ton of it on display. From having a head squished under a foot and a floor, impaling with wooden stakes, a head split open, decapitations and several set on fire, and the huge body count here means that there's so much more in here. These here are the film's best moments.The Bad News This one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws. The main one here is that it's way too cheesy at times for it's own good. From the rather goofy story to the one-liners that are uttered to the extreme amount of action, there's really nothing in here that gives the film anything other than a cheese-fest, and while it revels in that part, there's a sense that some might not get into it that much. The other flaw in this one is that there's a couple of segments in here that run too long or don't need to be there at all. The zombie encounter never needs to be there, since it doesn't offer up anything of value, other than the zombie make-up and probably could've been cut out. Also really should've been cut was the length of the Dracula segment, since there's a huge amount of time in this one that doesn't amount to much. From the long dinner-room scene to the rather dull and tortured revelation scene, this one goes on for a little longer than necessary. There's a few other small things here and there, but otherwise, these here are the film's true problems.The Final Verdict With a lot of great cheesy 80s action going for it and only a couple of flaws, there's not a whole lot that will hold this one down. Highly recommended for those who have a big appreciation for the kind of cheesy quality this represents, or fans of the genre, while those who don't enjoy those should still enjoy this one.Rated R Graphic Violence and some Language "},{"Title":"Entertaining Homage","Date":"17 September 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" Waxwork is a series of homages to classic horror films involving a story of wax displays that come to life.

Often cited as the first self-referential horror movie. Its showcase in a waxwork museum own by a mysterious, Mr. Lincoln (David Warner) and his midget & lurch like minions. These aren't your typical Vincent Price's 1953's House of Wax figures exhibit though, each one depicts a different story of death and murder by evil creatures. Nearly all the classic monsters are in this movie, ranging from the werewolf (John Rhys-Davies), Count Dracula (Miles O'Keeffe) to etc. stock characters. Some of them worth mentioning are Frankenstein's monster, the mummy, Phantom of the Opera, and zombies. There are some homage to other movies characters in the film such as the pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), the killer plant from The Little Shop of Horrors (1960) & the demon baby from It's Alive (1974). They even added the villainous real life historic figure Marquis de Sade (J. Kenneth Campbell) to the mixed. Warner & Campbell give the best performances from all the villains. It's too bad, the actors acting like solid wax models couldn't act still, as they were blinking, and slightly moving. They are not supposed to look alive, until the victim looking at the exhibit, overstep the borders of the exhibit. If they do, they're transform into the world of the display. If you die in their world, you die in real life. The movie is full of the 1980's horror clichés cheese archetypes, as a group of most unlikeable spoil rich university yippee students enter the evil museum. I found Mark Loftmore (Zack Galligan) as a great lead, but he was such a jerk. Mark's need for caffeine is introduced early in the first film, then it's promptly dropped and never goes anywhere. Plus, how on earth is he getting his facts about killings, before there isn't any clues of the crimes? It's like his character just jump over the script. The way, Zack acts is so wooded. Then there is Sarah Brightman (Deborah Foreman), the 'good' virgin girl who all for sadomasochism pain humiliation. It's really bugs me that she is a stupid damsel in distress type of a character, who not only doesn't want to rescue, but beg the bad guy to continue to torture her because she got an orgasm. She is like the wet dream of wife beaters everywhere. No strong feminism here. Even China Webster (Michelle Johnson) the archetype whore character, who seems like she is against vampires at first, gives up and surrendering herself to Dracula. Why, because women will fall in love with dangerous abusing men as long as they are handsome! What crap message is that!? The acting from these two are mediocre, at best. The only good thing about them are both women are just beautiful. Tony (Dana Ashbrook) come off a drug- addict idiot who you knew, is going to get killed off, first. So, no surprised there. Since Writer/director Anthony Hickox wrote the screenplay in only 3 days, the plot doesn't make much sense. The movie tries to explain more, through wheel chair bound Uncle, Sir Wilfred (Patrick Macnee), a former hunter of the supernatural, but it just set up more questions than answers. Then there is the bit about the wax sculptures being from the most evil men from the past, and they need victims to come back alive. Excuse me, this doesn't make any sense. Nearly none of those horror characters were alive, besides Jack the Ripper & Marquis de Sade. Somehow, I think the movie was trying to put Adolf Hitler in the film; seeing how much they mention fascism in the film. The movie made no more mention about Mark's attic and the glowing book of the Marquis de Sade in a trunk. What was that about? The ending is kinda weird, as the most evil creatures that ever live is against a group of old people getting their butt kick. I thought these were the most evil creatures that ever live? Also, what are the victim now bad guys? I can understand those who turn into monsters, but I can't see the old hunter teaming up with the werewolf that he just try to kill earlier in the film. This film is OK with its combination of horror and comedy. The movie has this weird hate/love relationship with smoking cigarettes that you will probably catch on. There is a Phantom of the Opera joke, that was supposed to be meant for Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th films about people making movies about anything these days, but they (the producers) couldn't get the rights for the character. The dialogue is full of cheesy one liners. You will get over the top gorn, spraying blood, mutilated flesh, and people getting rip apart. In some versions, the film was cut by the MPAA due to gore in the vampire sequence. It's badly edited, so just find the original copy. The set designs are really good & well captured. I love the black & white look of the zombie sequence. Amazingly accurate & professional looking, considering the films low budget. The score by Roger Bellon changes depending on which monster or era were in & is done in the classical scores of the famous Universal horror movie scores of the 30's/40's. The music choices are pretty hip. Look out for other horror movies references like the missing posters that looks like the posters from 1987's Lost Boys or the painting from 1989's Lobster Man from Mars. There is a sequel, 1992's Waxwork II Lost in Time worth checking out, but it's not as good as this movie. Still, despite its flaws, Waxwork is a wonderful horror film that scares as much as it entertains. Waxworks is a film made with heart & it shows. It's a horror film for horror fans, by horror fans.

Waxwork, his first feature as director, is one of them.David Warner is the untrustworthy owner of a strange wax museum that suddenly appears in the middle of an American suburb. A bunch of teens (including Zach Galligan, hilarious as rich, spoilt Mark) are invited for a special, late-night viewing. But stepping over the threshold of any exhibits takes curious onlookers into the world depicted and can end up taking their soul, with a certain number of souls needed to unleash horror upon the world.For the first half of the movie this works almost like an anthology movie, and works well. There's an enjoyable werewolf skit, a fun vampire moment and even an old-fashioned mummy. But as things grow increasingly preposterous (and as the plot developments are spouted by Mr Exposition aka Sir Wilfred, played by Patrick Macnee) they also grow a little bit tiresome as we head towards a finale that should be exciting and full of tension.Zach Galligan trying to fend off zombie hordes and Deborah Foreman (as Sarah) being punished by the Marquis De Sade are highlights in a finale crammed with just a little too much considering what the small film can manage. Homages abound and there is still enough fun to be had but it's all a bit anti-climactic in the last ten minutes or so when it should have stayed just as enjoyable as it was in the early scenes. Strangely enough, the unfolding of the plot and tying up of loose ends drags the film down slightly compared to the unreal madness that was so much fun before we received any explanations about the working of the wax displays.See this if you like La Casa Del Terror, The Monster Squad, Waxwork II Lost In Time.

But, the unsuspecting guests soon realize that the displays of familiar horror tales involving werewolves, vampires, and zombies, among other things, are more than life-like. Each are transported into something of a physical warp (maybe a time warp) in which they are transported into the scenes which culminate in the final display (and usually, their death and transformation into wax figures). The creepy Waxworks owner of course, intends for the guests to become part of his collection.So, the four friends enter the exhibit, but only two leave. And Mark (Zach Galligan), trying to link all of these disappearances to the Waxworks, is about to find out what's going on, especially with the help of a friend of his eccentric grandfather.These mini-horror movies within the main horror movie are semi-entertaining, at least up until the point when you find out that the Waxwork's motives have become a horror plot standard in which he is collecting something as part of a ritual needed to unleash previously inactive evil upon the world. Somebody's got to do it, the owner claims in jest. And the movie certainly becomes far too ridiculous when Mark and his grandfather's friend, Wolfy, find out what the owner is up to. Think Frankenstien with the fiery mob and pitchforks and everything. Although the film was an interesting the idea, the execution is mostly laughable by the end.

The four main characters are Bad Girl, Good Girl, Bad Boy, and Hero. They end up at a waxwork run by the worst-dressed man in history, a little person, and a really tall guy. However, the waxworks there are magical, for they suck each of the characters into a tableau....of EVIL.The definite climax of the film is when Good Girl exposes herself as a stone-cold freak, and is subsequently sucked into the world of the Marquis de Sade. Hilarity ensues.As a real movie, I give Waxwork a score of 0. But to judge it on a scale of general enjoyment and unintentional funniness, I give Waxwork a 10, resulting in a score of 5.

The presence of some horror stalwarts in the cast is reassuring, and the effects work isn't half bad. Some of the acting is poor from the younger cast members, and while it's not hard to forgive a low budgeted movie its failings, it's still annoying that the actors playing the wax models can't keep still, while the set nearly falls down at one point. The photography is also too cloudy at times, Gerry Lively's filters straining for colour ambiance.Still, it's a decent time filler that's made with love by a horror fan for horror fans. 5/10 "}{"Title":"Early entry in bloody teen bump-off movie stakes","Date":"16 March 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" I generally think of Zach Galligan as being fairly indistinguishable from David Naughton - both were personable young American leads who played the main protagonist in the 80s in highly successful horror/comedy movies (Naughton in An American Werewolf In London, Galligan in the more juvenile Gremlins and its sequel - Naughton's character didn't survive long enough for a sequel, of course), and both went from those successes to a gradual spiral into increasingly rubbishy films, mainly low budget horror, until their careers more or less petered out.Waxwork is early in Galligan's spiral. It is not complete rubbish. Even though the story (teens loose in a wax museum where the exhibits come to life and the young friends die one by one in gory fashion) was not exactly original even then, it has moderate production values, some well known names in the cast, committed performances, and is very professionally made.But the spiral continued, and what followed was not as good as Waxwork.

It was silly, it was bad but luckily they did not forgot to make the movie entertaining to watch. Plenty is happening for the horror fans and the movie is basically showing every classic horror character you could think off.It's really a very simplistic movie, that thrives on its concept. What you could say about its first half is that the movie is being a bit like Tales from the Crypt. It features different 'stories', characters and time periods, every time a character enters the world of a certain wax figure. Because of this concept, the movie can show off with featuring as many horror characters as possible. So, there are vampires, a wolf-man (played by John Rhys-Davies), zombies, a mummy and even more. This is fun and good all, though I would had still preferred if they put some more efforts in these separate stories as well. There really is no story to any of them and it besides doesn't make this the most consistent movie to watch, especially when the second half of the movie is starting to take a more different approach.The movie is also still lacking a good main character because for most part the movie seems to want to focus on multiple characters, rather on having one of two main characters. Or at least this is the case for the movie its first half. In the second half the movie seems to be more focused and it turns more into a good versus evil type of plot, with David Warner as the evil villain. Neither half of the movie is that great or original but both are still good and enjoyable, each in their own way.The movie is featuring some pretty decent gore as well, despite being more of a comedy than a straight-forward horror flick really. But some of the effects are really good and the movie isn't afraid to spew out some blood. It's highly enjoyable and surprising as well at times, with its gore.Not well written and not even all that well made but yet it's a very enjoyable movie, especially when you are into horror.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Garbage","Date":"14 August 2011","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" I love a bad movie.

"},{"Title":"The sauce makes the dish, but the aftertaste is pretty lousy","Date":"23 April 2011","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" Waxwork is one of the most frustrating offerings you're likely to come across if you explore the '80s splatter movie canon. On one hand, the film boasts a very cool concept, several splendid in-jokes for horror fans, and some delightfully grisly gore effects that every genre devotee will relish with fiendish glee. However, to enjoy those fantastic elements, you also have to contend with some truly wretched acting, atrocious dialogue that makes the fact that someone was actually paid to write this movie seem like a mortal sin, and a climax that spirals into absolute nonsense. One's enjoyment of the film as a whole will depend on how enthused you are by the former and how forgiving you are of the latter. However, if you don't mind seeing a prime slice of classic B-movie horror disintegrate before your very eyes, Waxwork offers enough moments of genius to merit a viewing, even if it doesn't earn a glowing review.Perhaps best described as a loving tribute to the genre, the film takes a largely anthological approach, delving into portions of several legendary horror films throughout the course of its padded running time. The initially simple plot involves a group of wholly obnoxious and blatantly stereotypical teen archetypes attending a shady midnight tour at a wax museum that specializes exclusively in macabre exhibits. One by one, our attendees cross the velvet ropes and step into the displays, at which point they become immersed in the world portrayed by the wax figures.Each exhibit represents an legendary icon of horror's past, and, though the segments refrain from crediting their direct sources, throughout the course of the film we visit homages to the werewolf, vampire, mummy, and zombie genres. The vampire installment is overwhelmingly the strongest, presenting a witty and splatter-fueled twist on the classic Dracula formula, and this deliciously twisted subplot would have been perfectly suited for an episode of Tales From The Crypt. In fact, the segment is pretty much worth the entire movie by itself, and the over-the-top gore on display presents a thrilling and pretty much amazing bit of parody.The winks to horror enthusiasts are smart and subtle, such as the black-and-white staging of the obviously Night Of The Living Dead-influenced zombie episode and the use of music from Boris Karloff's original Mummy film in the segment that echoes that classic. If Waxwork lived up to the promise implied by its sharpest moments, we would probably be dealing with a classic here. However, at some point the film-makers decide that they want a more cohesive plot, and that is precisely the decision that makes the film veer way off track.The absurd purpose attributed to the lethal museum is downright stupid, and once we find out that the malevolent curator is actually instigating a plot to bring his sculptures back to life, the film instantly stops being clever. You see, the titular waxwork is actually a gallery of infamous villains whom the curator wants to resurrect and unleash upon the world. Since the horror movie-referencing displays are placed alongside real-world historical figures like the Marquis de Sade and Jack The Ripper, the concussed logic of the master-plan not only suggests that there was a zombie outbreak at some point in history, but that the events portrayed in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers actually occurred as well.The denouement, where the wax sculptures do indeed come to life, erupts into a battle between the forces of evil and a band of elderly defenders (please don't ask), and any lingering pretensions we have of Waxwork living up to its nifty premise come to a screeching halt along with the film. And when a decidedly sissified Maquis de Sade becomes one of the most prominent villains, the highlights in the first half of the movie fade into a distant memory. On that front, the de Sade segment is an awkwardly misogynistic bit that completely derails the mirthful tone the movie maintains up until that point, and once the Marquis makes his entrance the film ceases being fun and starts becoming tedious.Since the thin budget clearly didn't allow the film-makers to build a gallery of wax sculptures, the actors are called upon to, literally, stand in. This turns into a problem when not a single member of the cast can hold still even for a moment, and any time we see the wax figures on the screen, they end up invariably flinching before the shot is through.Though it eventually devolves into a ludicrous mess, Waxwork has enough hints of genuine inspiration to make it a memorable affair. However, considering the promise it shows during its better moments, the end result is a certifiable disappointment. To quote the dwarven doorman who admits the characters into the world of Waxwork, we verr achspuckting more.

The 80's was a blessing and a curse for horror fans because while there were some classic films these here opened the floodgates to some of the worst films ever made, which usually went straight to video. Some of the straight to video stuff was actually pretty good but most of the time they were simply forgotten.I first stumbled upon Waxwork on Cinemax, which was a horror fiends best friend. I had heard that this was a very good, old fashioned horror film that had all of the good stuff. I don't believe the film ever got a theatrical release, although some claim that it did. Either way, this is the perfect example of a film finding its core audience on video and cable showings. Fourteen years after being made Waxwork has built a huge cult following. Of course, since there were fans producer's got the idea for a sequel, which happened six years later in Waxwork 2 Lost in Time.In the first film a group of teenagers are invited to a special midnight screening of a new wax museum being hosted by Mr. Lincoln (David Warner). The six friends show up and immediately split up to look at the exhibits. These aren't your typical Vincent Price wax figures though, each one tells a different story of death and murder and when the guests cross the ropes they are transported to the strange and deadly world, which the exhibits showed.Tony (Dana Ashbrook) crosses the ropes and enters the world of werewolves. The slut China (Michele Johnson) gets her wishes granted when she is thrown into a beautiful castle with a beautiful man but unfortunately this man turns out to be Count Dracula himself. When the two don't show up at school the next day their friends decide to go to the police who turn out to be no help at all. So, with nothing left to lose they travel back to the wax museum where more horror stories come to life.Waxwork is a decent little chiller, which certainly deserves the cult following its gotten over the past decade or so. The film is far from perfect but God knows the horror community has had to suffer through a lot worse. While there are some bad things in the film the good outweigh them, which makes the film worth viewing. The best thing about the movie is the short stories that deal with the characters going back to deal with various monsters ranging from vampires, werewolves, mummies and even the living dead. These segments are very short, which is a good thing because they leave the story behind and get down to the action, which is delivered in good gory fun.Another good aspect is the actual effects, which are pretty damn good especially considering the budget of the film. The werewolf transformation, while not in the same league as The Howling, is still very good looking. The best sequence is the one dealing with the mummy, which is full of wonderful atmosphere and a good little chill as the mummy comes to life. The one bad thing about the movie is all the time spent outside the wax museum. The very stupid plot about the investigation is useless, boring and takes away from all the fun. Had the film been trimmed by ten or fifteen minutes Waxwork would have been a lot better.

The combination isn't always successful and the stories are a little too short to value them properly, but nevertheless Waxwork is an entertaining and reasonably well-made movie. Writer/director Anthony Hickox surely knows his genre classics and he's also smart enough to add a lot of comedy, homage and tongue-in-cheek situations to his screenplay. If this subject matter had been intended as a serious horror film, it would have failed miserably, that's for sure. A bizarrely cloaked man invites the usual crowd of brainless teenagers to a private showing of the exhibits in his wax museum (that seemly appeared out of nowhere) around midnight. Each morbid exhibit depicts a familiar horror tableau, but the role of the victims is reserved for the teenagers that get sucked into the exhibit and catapulted back in time! As soon as the awkward museum owner (played by a clearly amused David Warner) completed his tableaux with six fresh wax-victims, he has the power to bring the world to an end! Now, many horror villains have tried to destroy the world over the years but at least this guy has a good reason, namely Someone has got to do it. The little in between tales are imaginatively presented and revolve on horror's greatest classics, such as Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy and Night of the Living Dead. They're also surprisingly gory and literally buckets of blood splash over the screen. Eventually the wraparound story, with the remaining teenagers and a troop of old guys fighting the forces of evil, gets uninteresting and far too hectic. The whole climax battle really got on my nerves, actually. The acting performances are overall quite lousy and I at least expected some nudity coming from Michelle Johnson.
