I will agree that it is very silly, and certainly not Oscar worthy. Don't expect a sophisticated plot, and a superlative script. Expect a harmless and fun Christmas comedy, that way you are in for a good time.While very predictable in plotting and rather repetitive and slow in the middle half; especially in the first thirty minutes Ernest Saves Christmas does have its funny moments. And I must say the scene with the magic sleigh was uproariously funny. Amongst the humour, is an in general heart-warming story about Santa and his attempts to find a successor.The camera-work may be a tad dated, but the music is very nice indeed. And I actually thought the acting is above decent, with the late (and talented) Jim Varney wonderfully spirited as Ernest and Douglas Seale is simply great as Santa. The opening credits with the collage of Christmas carols were a delight.Ernest Saves Christmas is an above average seasonal comedy about the power of belief and the dignity of an individual. It is far from a masterpiece, but seriously I wasn't expecting it to be. I got exactly what I wanted, a fun film that while predictable and silly is lots of fun too. I do also think it is underrated; there are much worse movies out there, namely any of the Friedberg-Seltzer movies, Home Alone 4 and SuperbabiesBaby Geniuses 2. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Jim Varney at his best!!!","Date":"16 November 2001","Score":"11 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  This, my personal favorite Ernest film, is arguably one of the funniest.

Underneath the layers of Hee-Haw-level blue-collar humor so synonymous with Ernest is a Christmas movie with heart-- surprising for the classic character. In a funny way, it almost seems like a different take on Miracle on 34th Street-- the old man who knows he's Santa Claus and the cynical young girl who says it isn't so. Ernest Saves Christmas remains one of the ideal holiday comedies around, whether it was a serious movie or not.

Jim Varney was the Charles Chaplin of the 1980's & early 1990's. Jim Varney's goofy alter ego, Ernest was famous for his trademark slapstick humor, countless Bugs Bunny type dress up egos, and dumb humor. Despite, Ernest being nearly stupid, Jim Varney, the actor was a high IQ man. Jim Varney was also a serious Shakespearian actor. He was phenomenal and much admired in the 'circle' of Shakespeare, on a par with Sir Lawrence Olivier.. He said he loved playing Ernest because it was (for him) the direct opposite of doing Shakespeare. Ernest first made his mark doing commericals for nearly everything, it was his work with Coca-Cola that allow the Christmas ad's in the opening of the film. It opens up with Santa Claus (Douglas Seale) arrived at the Orlando Airport. Douglas Seale has one of the sweetest voices, and it's works for being Santa Claus. Ernest P. Worrell works as a taxi driver, and picks him up. Santa Claus is on his way to get a local celebrity Joe Carruthers to be new Santa Claus due to Douglas thinking of retiring. While they are driving, a runaway teenage girl (Noelle Parker) calling herself Harmony Starr joins Ernest and Santa in the cab. Harmony is a horrible character, who lies non-stop on end. However on Christmas eve, her conscience prevails and she reforms her ways. Ernest drops him off to meet Joe, but Ernest discovers that Santa left his magic sack behind in the cab, and Ernest begins a quest to find the old man and return it to him. There is a number of cool scenes in the movie that show Jim Varney's work, one is the POV Vern's house which pays tribute to the original commercials that first introduced Ernest, the audience never sees Vern's face. The other is when Ernest poses as Astor Clementh, an employee of the governor and Harmony as the governor's niece Mindy, and the two help Santa escape from jail when Santa got himself locked up by Joe's boss. The other is when Ernest disguises himself as an Apopka snake rancher (Lloyd Worrell from Knowhutimean? Hey Vern, It's my Family Album) who sneaks Santa into a movie studio to find Joe again. There are also supporting cast from his TV show days, as Chuck and Bobby (Gailard Sartain & Bill Byrge) that serves as sub-plot as two airport workers trying to control Santa's reindeer. The movie has a strong Christmas theme and the humor will keep a range of ages entertained nonetheless. Ernest is funny without using sex. Ernest also use little violence and harsh language. Very heartwarming, and works for family events. The cut-backs of the film can be the over used of advertising in this movie and re-cuts of older commericals (good example the pancake on parade), dodgy plot-points, and bad Christmas puns. Director John Cherry and Jim Varney made a good movie for such a low-budget and it's one of the last of the good Ernest movies. Yeah, the Ernest movies are pretty much the ultimate in guilty pleasure crapfests, but this brings out the Christmas spirit in all of us.

One day, he crashes his taxi into the unloading area of the airport and must make a beeline out of the site. Seeing a white-bearded gentleman who needs a cab, he hustles the old guy into his clutches and speeds off. Although Ernest sings O Christmas Tree with only these three words, he's really a nice guy. But, when the bearded one tells Ernest that his name is Santa Claus, Ernest doesn't really believe him. He drops the old man off, however, at a retirement home, as requested. Picking up a Christmas tree that fell off a truck and a homeless young teenage girl with an attitude, Ernest makes his way over to Vern's house to decorate. But, wait. The old man left his red, very large duffle-type bag on board. As Ernest opens the bag, he gets a glimpse of the bag's magical powers. Could this really have been Santa? Trying to return the sack to Mr. Claus, Ernest learns, however, that the old man has been thrown in jail. Is it up to Ernest to make sure Santa can fly on his big day? This is a sweet and fun family film that borrows a bit from Miracle on 34th Street and other holiday flicks. There is only one Ernest, of course, and Varney provides much comedic mayhem with his unique character. Just watch him talk about channel number 5 perfume or a failure to accumulate and you will be laughing heartily. His expressions are priceless, too. The rest of the cast, although unknown, are fine as well. No one will find fault with the look of the film, either, as the costumes, sets, and production values are high. Perhaps you have heard that Varney's humor is sometimes of the gross-out nature and you would rather not share his films with your family. Please, do reconsider when it comes to this one. Its humor is infectious, not offensive, and its sweet tale will warm the hearts of its viewers. So, make a batch of mulled, spiced cider and buttered popcorn and put this one into the home theater machine in the very near future.

This review is probably less about the actual quality of this movie and more about how it makes me feel because I grew up with Ernest like many of us did. I probably watched Ernest Goes To Camp and this film a thousand times at least, not to mention his Saturday morning TV Series. It has been years since I watched any of Ernest's antics and decided to check out the old Christmas classic this year. What a terrific movie for families and what a talent Jim Varney was. Ernest (in general and in this movie) is so ridiculous, campy, cheesy and its just the perfect blend of all of that with a healthy dose of true comedy. The movie is cute and fun full of adventure and magic and holiday spirit. It isn't sappy but if you look under the surface there really is a sweet story there and has several different characters going through different things throughout the film. For what some might call a silly comedy, it is actually smartly written. It knows exactly its demographic and most importantly it knows what fans of Ernest want to see. It is a Christmas movie at its heart and soul and yet doesn't forget to include everything you love about Ernest and his adventures.I forgot just how amazing Jim Varney was in this role. His physical comedy is really something to see, whether he's pretending to be a silly character (snake farmer, old lady etc) or he's on a rant through Vern's house or trying to save a Christmas tree from the highway. He's simple and yet brilliant and full of heart. Its a great character and I forgot just how much I liked him. Ernest is the perfect character to put into a Christmas film and no one could do it like Varney. Not to be outdone the supporting cast is so good in their roles. Douglas Seale is amazing as Santa who is ready to retire and looking for his replacement. He is so out of place in the fast paced world but a strong person who is being treated so poorly. The chemistry with him and Varney is perfect for the film. Oliver Clark is the Mister Rogers type TV personality that Santa wants to replace him. Clark is good, although a little toned down compared to some of the other performances in the film. He is still very good in the movie. One of the first crushes I remember having was on Noelle Parker's Harmony. She is a wayward kid that lies and steals and happens to come across Ernest and Santa and learns the errors of her ways. She is the perfect personification of an 80's kid with the side pony and the clothes she wears. She nails the role and while its a very cookie cutter role, she is does it well (and she's as cute as she was back then.) Ernest regulars Bill Byrge and Robert Lesser show up as Bobby and Marty in a silly little side story that happens to be hilarious.I just don't know how anyone can't like this movie. I mean it isn't an Oscar winner and if you're looking for raunchy comedy you won't find it anywhere here at all. This is a clean cut family film with some really smart comedy and brilliantly they made sure John Cherry (who is an Ernest director staple) direct this one. He has done Ernest films and TV Shows since its conception it would seem and so he knows the character and likely worked well with Varney. If you're going into this with the right expectations you can't possibly be disappointed. If you don't know anything about Ernest or you're expecting some modern day raunch comedy then you'll hate this. This has everything you could possibly want from a comedy like this. I will be making my rounds of Ernest films starting now because I forgot how much I enjoyed the sheer silliness and this will be a Christmas staple in my house for certain. 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Great Start, But 'Santa' Dropped The Sleigh","Date":"7 January 2007","Score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" This movie started off great; the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters.

Cherry III / Cast Jim Varney, Douglas Seale, Oliver Clark, Noelle Parker, Gailard Sartain Easily the best Ernest P. Worrell comedy in a series that are largely mediocre. The plot here is more appealing than the average Ernest film. Douglas Seale plays Saint Nick searching for his replacement. He sights a kids entertainer played by Oliver Clark and is aided by Ernest for assistance. There is a subplot involving a runaway teenage girl whom Ernest shelters. She goes through Santa's big red sack, emptying it of its endless contents. How that works is not explained especially when factoring the ratio of children in the world. Maybe we are suppose to just buy the whole magic thing. The conclusion is a farce with reindeer operating like a jet plane but director John R. Cherry 3rd gives the film heart. Production is okay and Jim Varney is funny as Ernest who incorporates wild antics in his attempts to help Santa. Seale makes for an excellent Santa. Clark brings warmth and goodness as the entertainer wrestling with contract issues. Noelle Parker plays the teenage runaway who must comes to terms with decisions that led to her current lifestyle. Gailard Sartain and Bill Byrge are funny as two security guards overwhelmed with surprise packages. Nothing more than an Ernest film but it is a definite cut above the others.

If you were to dig deeper into the genre though, maybe into like the third or fourth tier, you'll eventually come across Ernest Saves Christmas.The film starts off on a good note, with holiday music playing and the intro credits being displayed alongside Norman Rockwell (I assume) artwork of Santa Clause. Once the intro credits finalize and we fade in, we see a plane landing at the Orlando International Airport in Florida. The time is 2 PM, December 23rd. Soon we find out that one of the passengers who just safely arrived is the actual Santa (Douglas Seale). Although he is very open/honest, and not trying the slightest to hide his real identity, basically no one ever thinks to themselves that he is who he looks like.When Santa needs a taxi to leave the airport, that's when Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney) steps in. Like Mr. Bean (another great family- friendly character from about the same time), Ernest is also -- essentially -- a danger to society. Here, just as a taxi driver for a very brief amount of time before getting fired, Ernest terrifies one of his passengers to the point in which he's literally scared stiff. He completely annihilates the luggage of passengers at the airport. Furthermore, he also creates chaos and crashes on the highway -- just so he can get a Christmas tree for his buddy named Vern (who later on in the film, gets the inside of his nice, cozy home seriously wrecked by Ernest). As awful as Ernest might sound though, the truth is he's actually a pretty good guy.As the film goes on, we find out that Santa's purpose in Orlando, Florida -- the day before Christmas Eve -- is to find a man named Joe Carruthers (Oliver Clark). Although Joe is best known for being the former host of a recently cancelled television program for children, according to Santa, this minor celebrity is the right man to take over his incredibly important role/title. However, if Santa fails at getting Joe to be his successor, Christmas as we know it (the magic, the joy, the feelings, and so forth) will apparently be gone forever. I know this is just an Ernest film, but looking back, it would've been nice if someone maybe questioned Santa about this depressing possibility (as in, can you please explain how and/or why Christmas will somehow be doomed forever?).In addition to Ernest and Santa, the other main character is Harmony Starr (Noelle Parker). She is a runaway/troubled teen who lies here and there about her true identity. Just like Santa, she meets Ernest when she enters his cab. The three of them ultimately work together to make sure that Joe becomes the next Santa Clause -- in order to keep Christmas alive.Overall, while the film is definitely not as strong or as memorable as others in the Christmas genre, it's still an enjoyable 90-plus minute experience. Additionally, as a quick side note, I really like how Ernest has a Keep Christ in Christmas bumper sticker in his glove compartment. That's something that surely wouldn't be left in any final cut today -- due to how oversensitive, easily offended, and politically correct our society/culture has sadly become.Rating 6 out of 10 stars "},{"Title":"An Annual Christmas Tradition","Date":"29 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Ernest helps Santa Claus as he searches for his successor.I thought I had already written a review, but either I was mistaken or IMDb deleted it.

I had to revisit a childhood favorite of mine Ernest Saves Christmas. I haven't seen this for over twenty years and remember loving and re-watching it so many times back in the late 80s.You know (Vern,) watching these Ernest movies as an adult, it's not quite the same effect as viewing them through the eyes of a child. Recently, I've been revisiting three of the four I loved (or liked) as a child Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest Saves Christmas and Ernest Scared Stupid. (I have yet to re-watch Ernest Goes to Jail, and I will soon. I do have that on BluRay now, and that was my personal favorite as a child with this holiday special as #2.) And, boy, I can see how I liked them in my youth, and they do have some absolute humor that translates to adults, but they are over-the-top silly at times.That said, there's a purity to them. Ernest, er, the late and great Jim Varney, has such a heart and kept everything in his act and movies clean. I like that. In fact, I'm surprised these movies are rated as high as PG. Honestly, there's nothing, and rightfully so, in them that should offend anyone. Thank you, Mr. Varney.Here, in Ernest Saves Christmas, Ernest, the G-Rated, but somewhat unsafe, taxi driver gets mixed up with the real Santa Claus as he's on a mission to pass the torch onto a new Santa as the magic is up.Naturally, things are a lot more complicated as they appear and Ernest screws up a lot, but in the end, there's the heart and soul of Ernest P. Worrell who brings it all together.While not perfect, you gotta admire it for its simplicity in a complicated film. One can criticize Varney's odd facial expressions and zoom-ins or even dislike them. But, he had a heart and he set out to make a (what I think should be a G-Rated) special Christmas movie. Mission Accomplished.* * * Final thoughts Don't get me wrong. This movie is way silly. And I had to endure a few too many made-for-younger-crowds scenes, like eyes darting back and forth as a gag. It's okay to get past that when you know the core audience. I wish these movies, the Ernest series, would come back for the next generation so they can appreciate more family-friendly, (should be!)

The holidays are here again and once upon a time this was my favorite holiday film. I was a youngster to be sure but this goofy thing was always on my holiday viewing. It probably also added to my love of the Santa Claus legend. Now as an adult I was tempted to give this a look through the eyes of an adult. It's not the nicest thing to do because as we age we grow cynical but I really wanted to see this movie again.I don't know what happened but I still got a lot of joy out of it. I won't deny that nostalgia probably fogged my lens but 'Ernest Saves Christmas' genuinely matches all the criteria for a heart warming Christmas film. And now you'll ask me Do you really still enjoy Ernest as a grown man? No, not really. Oddly enough Ernest is not what draws me to this movie. The thing I love about this movie is it's portrayal of Santa Claus. Ernest is off the wall goofy but the Santa legend is taken super seriously. Douglas Seale gives in my opinion probably the best portrayal of Santa Claus in any medium.And so there are really two films to be reviewed here. The story of a retiring Santa reluctantly hanging up the sack and Ernest making a goof of himself in the process. I almost wish Ernest himself weren't actually in this movie because the stuff with Santa is so interesting and heartwarming. Can you really hate Ernest though? I don't know. Jim Varney definitely shovels it out and throws everything at the wall in the hopes that something might stick. I guess I'd say he's a low rent hillbilly Pee-Wee Herman. I was an Ernest fan as a kid though and so I tried to think about what appealed to me back then. Varney just has a manic energy and does anything for a laugh. Children will love him as did I. Is it deep or sophisticated comedy? No. Is it harmless? Yes. Don't get me wrong there are moments when Varney enters Jar Jar Binks territory but the whole thing is meant to be as goofy as possible and I might as well let it slide. I mean it's Christmas right?What makes me love this film is Santa. Santa Claus is an interesting character with a lot of myths surrounding him. 'Ernest Saves Christmas' has the great benefit of having an actor who treats the role like Hamlet and brings out it's intricacies. I love Douglas Seale in this part. It's like the kind of performance where the actor melds with the character. Seale has a genuine joy in the way he describes the actions of Santa Claus. He interacts with every character with kindness, love, and respect. You would imagine an Ernest film would go for the cheapest laughs but Seales' Santa Claus has nothing but dignity. The plot is a bit contrived but there are stakes here, tremendous stakes. Christmas needs to be saved here and that is because of Seale's conveying the plot. Is he manipulating me? I don't know. On paper I imagine this character reads terribly. Santa spends so much of the film doing nothing but delivering exposition. He does so in a way that perfectly captures the essence of the character but also of the other character's he is interacting with. I don't really see a whole lot of worth in the Santa myth. I always thought it was a bad idea to get kids to believe in Santa Claus but this is the Santa Claus I would want to believe in.I'm not going to bother giving this a star rating or going into it's many other flaws. It's a goofy movie but it still had the power to put me in the Christmas spirit. If you can stand a little annoying Ernest comedy than you are treated to a wonderful portrayal of Santa Claus.

It's rare today to find even a Christmas movie that's not filled with bad language, sexual innuendo, and other filth- but every Ernest movie is 100% clean, family-friendly fun. As an example I cite the character in this movie (forget his or the actor's name, it's been ages) who used to host a children's show, but got a part in a movie and couldn't bring himself to say a certain line with a bad word, because he couldn't stand to think of the children hearing him say it. That wasn't just that character's attitude, it was Jim Varney's as well. Varney was a chain smoker- however he would never light up if there was a child around. And he refused to use foul language. I think Varney also made a nod to the state of movies with his Mr. Apopka the snake handler character in this movie- That's all these Hollywood folk want. Poison! Speaking of characters, Jim's various personifications always had me rolling on the floor. In this movie the best was definitely the old lady.

Worell helping an aging Santa Claus to find his successor before it's too late. Santa Claus is getting older and is forgetting such important things like who's naughty, and who's nice, and who asked a toy truck, etc. These of course are very important things for Santa to have stored in his memory. So in order to keep Christmas going at a rapid pace, Santa sets his sights on Joe Carruthers (a children's ) to take over the very important job. Problem is that Joe is so busy with his acting career that each time Santa tries to tell him about the gig, he either leaves in a rush thanks to his money hungry agent, or doesn't believe that what Santa is saying is real. That's where Ernest and a runaway teenage girl named Harmony come into play. They go on a journey with Santa to make Joe the new Santa Claus thereby saving Christmas.I really enjoyed this Ernest film. It isn't as dumb and pointless as some of the other Ernest films done before and after, it has a really nice message and is a heart warming Christmas movie. Jim Varney does his usual Ernest part to perfection and I really liked the dynamic between him, Noelle Parker (Harmony) and Douglas Seale (Santa Claus). You can see that they really believe in Santa eventually and come to care about him and saving Christmas. There are some laughs in this as well, I always loved when Ernest would dress up as the old woman with the wig and neck brace. Pretty solid comedic moments in this one for sureI highly recommend anyone looking for a good Christmas movie to see 'Ernest Saves Christmas'. Douglas Seale may be the most realistic Santa Claus I've seen in more recent Christmas movies. He has a classic look to him in this film that I love, it adds to the story wonderfully. It isn't the huge belly/bright white beard look, it's a more old styled Santa Claus character which was refreshing to see.

Worrell and his feature film vehicles may depend on personal taste. If you enjoy the shtick of the late Jim Varney in this role, you may very well enjoy the movie. It goes without saying that it's going to be awfully silly at times, and it does get rather repetitive as it plays out, but there's still a fair amount of charm and good intentions to the material. Ernest in this case is a good hearted cab driver who makes the acquaintance of Saint Nick, wonderfully played by Douglas Seale. Saint Nick now realizes it's time for another person to take on the persona and perform the duties required, and he believes that person is local children's show host Joe Carruthers (Oliver Clark). Assorted wacky escapades, including an out of control sleigh ride, an airport hanger full of reindeer, and Ernest donning various disguises and pulling various scams, occur along the way. Varney is as enthusiastic and upbeat as ever, and receives decent support from the other actors, especially Seale and Clark. Robert Lesser is amusing as the stereotypically sleazy agent, and the ever delightful Billie Bird can be seen in one of her sweet old lady roles (she and her contemporary Frances Bay really cornered the market on this sort of thing). The screenplay also works into the story, among more traditional Christmas themes, the idea that people shouldn't be too quick to think cynically, or too quick to judge someone, and learn to trust them, as well as the idea of regaining a degree of childhood innocence; this is all applied to the little girl lost character of Harmony appealingly played by Noelle Parker. One of the nicest parts is when a businessmen (from Canada!) had declared to Santa that if anything he wanted to see snow for Christmas, and gets his wish. Some of the comedy really is too much at times, for example the reindeer scenes with some shameless goofy mugging (not to mention eyeball gags) from Gailard Sartain and Bill Byrge. The business with the horror film within the film may also be seen as questionable; try explaining it to the younger kids, even if it's deliberately designed as being very low rent and cheesy. It's interesting to see that the composer is the aptly named Mark Snow, who went on to be the in-house composer on 'The X-Files'. Overall, a reasonably engaging bit of holiday fare, even if just for nostalgic reasons for those who saw it at a younger age back in '88. Six out of 10.

A lot of his stuff was pre - Jim Carey , and he managed to really pull off some hilarious physical comedy. The actors in this movie are believable , although the plot does get a little absurd.

It isn't high-brow entertainment the plot is pedestrian, and the production values are minimal. That said, this is Jim Varney's magnum opus, and it is simply a delightful, affirmative and even inspirational statement about the power of belief and the dignity of the individual. Ernest is the epitome of, what St. Francis called, the great fool of God. His child-like simplicity and optimistic belief in the goodness of mankind and the benevolence of the Universe is rewarded with the revelation that Santa Claus does indeed exist. Along the way, he manages to showcase his considerable talent for character-acting and his incomparable comedic timing.Yes, Virgina. There is a Santa Claus! And this film gets played at least once a year in my household, a tradition now of almost twenty years standing. It is a cherished talisman of my family, along with A Christmas Story and the 1951 version of Scrooge.If, while watching this film, you don't find yourself laughing and crying and yearning for a world where Santa really exists, you simply are beyond redemption.

It's funny, and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love.

I've had the (un)-pleasurable experience of sitting through Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest Scared Stupid, Ernest Saves Christmas, and perhaps some others that I don't remember. (There are about one hundred Ernest films, aren't there?)In this film, Ernest has to save Santa Claus by delivering toys and searching for a successor (?). I haven't seen this film for about three years, so I'm a bit rusty on the plot.One thing the Ernest films do have is a good sense of unrealistic playfulness. Its audience is children, and Jim Varney seems to play right to this. Varney (who passed away in 2001 due to a long fight with cancer) was a good comedian. He didn't spin crude gags. He seemed to stick to childrens' films (Toy Story, Atlantis--his last film), and when he did try an adult film once it turned out to be one of the worst comedies ever. (It's called Snow Academy--no, it's not a sequel to Police Academy.)I actually found myself (despite the film being utterly ridiculous and stupid in any and every way) enjoying Ernest Saves Christmas, because while it is a bit odd, it targets the jokes to its audience well, and I think adults can enjoy the films just because they are reminiscent of childhood.Unfortunately, I just can't muster up enough to give this movie a high rating. Instead, I'll give it two and a half stars (average) and tell you that if you have kids, you should definitely get them to watch the Ernest films. If you don't, I'd recommend you stay away from the films.

Unfortunately, then Jim Varney as Ernest shows up to wreck everything. The plot is familiar to anybody who watched the Flintstones Xmas episode (which is everybody in the free world as far as I know) - Santa can't make his deliveries on Xmas eve and some unqualified idiot has to pitch in. Ernest does this here, and the results leave everything to be desired in the way of story originality and comic staging and timing. The slapstick is the whole point of the exercise and here it is very sloppy and unconvincing. Whoever saw Varney as a physical comedian needs an eye exam. He just can't do the job very well. And if this movie fails as slapstick it fails period, since there is not much else here to watch. Avoid.

Even after all these years I remember my parents taking me to the movies to see ERNEST GOES TO CAMP and I remember how happy I was at the age of eight to know this movie here was coming out. As I went to view this movie again, probably my first time in fifteen-years, I wasn't really sure what to expect but it wasn't too bad. The story is quite simple as Ernest picks up Santa Claus at the airport and must help him convince another guy that he's going to be the new Santa. The film certainly didn't thrill me or entertain me as much as when I was a kid but that's to be expected. I'm sure kids today would still eat this film as it's still extremely cute and the message is still there. I'm sure adults will have to be fans of Ernest but I find him charming in his own way. Only Jim Varney could create a character like this and while it's true he's obnoxious, that's kinda the point as the character was aimed at children. With that in mind I think he made a very love able character that many kids will continue to enjoy over the years. Even when I forget that I'm now an adult, the character makes me smile. As for the film, it starts off a lot better than it ends. I think the first thirty-minutes are quite clever as we get a few good twists and the storyline itself, while simple, is still pretty imaginative. I think what really hurts the movie are the cut aways to the Chuck and Bobby characters by series regulars Gailard Sarain and Bill Byrge. The scenes with them and the reindeer's never get any laughs and they really take away from the action going on with Ernest and Santa. I think that most people will read the title and know whether or not they'll like this. If you're a fan of Ernest and can take his humor then this is an enjoyable little film. If you're not a fan then you know to stay away.

Ernest is the only real likable character in the story. He provides some pretty good lines, but some of the scenes could have been done better (i.e. - him talking with the imaginary Vern as though Ernest is in the room with him). Everybody else on the film did not grab my attention. The runaway girl storyline was somewhat touching but she just didn't grab me really tight. Santa was ok but he isn't nearly as good as some other Santa's I've watched on other movies. The plot in the film is, in my opinion, too weak to fit as a Christmas movie. Of course, every sensible human knows that Santa is not real but at least in other Christmas movies, he doesn't bring along weird things like floating up-side-down reindeer or a computerized sledge. Those things plus others put a damper on the story. And of course there's no believability throughout the film - what can you expect anyway from Ernest. The lack of believablility took the Christmas charm out of the movie. We don't see any character development either. The young girl supposedly gets back together with her mom but the film does not bring that out very clearly. There's also the damper of Santa turning over the reigns to another person. All in all, this film is recommended for family viewing due to the lack of swearing, violence, and sex, and simply because the film is too simple for anybody in the family NOT to understand.
