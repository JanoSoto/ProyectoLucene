[{"Title":"A Definite Thumbs Up.","Date":"28 May 2005","Score":"50 out of 55 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" Thanks to modern technology, another film noir classic has escaped from Hollywood's vault of too-often-overlooked or forgotten films. Albeit a minor classic, The Hitch-Hiker, directed by Ida Lupino, is a taut drama notable for it's realism, as well as a haunting performance by William Talman.Reputedly based on a true incident (Penned from the headlines), the story traces the movements of a hitch-hiker, Emmett Myers (Talman), who repays his highway hosts by robbing and murdering them. Initially, we are shown mere glimpses of Myers and his victims, which successfully sets the stage for the introduction of Roy Collins (Edmond O'Brien) and Gilbert Bowen (Frank Lovejoy), two friends on their way to a fishing trip in Mexico, when, unawares, they pick up Myers.What follows is a realistic depiction of what most likely would transpire when ordinary people are suddenly faced with such extraordinary circumstances. And the strength of the film lies in the fact that when Collins and Bowen are kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to do the bidding of their captor, they react and behave in a manner that is both consistent with their current state of affairs and believable. There are no feigned heroics or superhuman contrivances that allow the two captives to effect an escape; instead, the story plays out in much the way one would, in reality, expect in such a situation, which, when extrapolated, effectively drives home the true horror of Collin's and Bowen's circumstance.The lion's share of the credit for the success of this film must go to director Ida Lupino, whose almost documentary-style approach to the story lends it the necessary grit and intensity. She scores double points, as well, for not only delivering a memorable film, but doing so at a time in which few women were afforded the opportunity to perform at such a level behind the camera. Lupino's success no doubt helped pave the way for the likes of Jane Campion, Jodie Foster, Gillian Armstrong, Allison Anders and a host of other women who have since proved that gender alone does not equate to excellence and ability in the director's chair.In arguably his best performance, character actor William Talman turns in a memorable performance as the sociopath, Myers. Forget your Freddys and Jasons; Talman's portrayal creates the kind of character that nightmares are really made of. Myers is a guy you could pass on the street, or-- yes, even give a lift to if you saw him with his thumb out on the highway-- without giving him a second thought. And that's what makes him so scary; his disguise is that he doesn't have a disguise, and it's so much more effective than having a hockey mask or hands with steel fingers could ever be.O'Brien and Lovejoy also turn in credible performances, creating characters who, like Talman's Myers, are real. Watching them, you believe that Collins is, indeed, an auto mechanic, and Bowen a draftsman; two friends off together to do some fishing.The supporting cast includes Jose Torvay (Captain Alvarado); Jean Del Val (Inspector General); Clark Howat (Government Agent); and Natividad Vacio (Jose). The 71 minute running time is perfect for this film; rather than resort to superfluous filler, Lupino stays on task without ever straying, and in the end makes The Hitch-Hiker a ride that will leave you wondering what you would do in a like situation, and hoping that you'll never have to find out. It's the magic of the movies.

Edmond O'Brien ('D.O.A.') and Frank Lovejoy ('in A Lonely Place') play two buddies on a road trip who pick up a hitch-hiker (William Talman, best remembered as Hamilton Berger on the old Perry Mason TV show). BIG MISTAKE! He is actually notorious psycho killer Emmett Myers. Talman gives a terrific performance as Myers, a real nasty piece of work with a bum eye so you never know if he's asleep or awake. He holds the men hostage, bullies and provokes them, even uses them as target practice. We've seen many similar plots over the years but I thought this was a fresh and unpredictable. Lupino's direction really suits the material, the tension builds throughout, and Talman is unforgettable. If you like thrillers track this one down. Highly recommended.

It is essentially a three character story about two pals on a fishing trip (or is it?) who stop to pick up a hitch-hiker whose car has apparently broken down, What they don't realize is that the hitchhiker is a crazed killer. The two buddies are played by two of the best character actors of the period, Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy. The hitcher, in the role of his career, is played by William Tallman (of TV's Perry Mason fame). The story covers their trek across the desert back roads of Mexico in an effort to evade the law. Most of the film takes place within the claustrophobic confines of O'Brien's car as he and Lovejoy remain at the mercy of loose cannon Tallman never knowing where or when he might decide to shoot them. Lupino gives us a compact, tense and suspenseful thriller. Shot in black and white, it runs a brief 71 minutes and delivers an excellent drama on a limited budget. Rarely seen today, this movie is a buried little treasure.

Sure you'll wonder how you'd respond or randomly imagine what it would feel like, but in general the true events won't haunt your thoughts for long. In the case of Ida Lupino's The Hitch-Hiker, this is totally different! Chances are high that once in your life, or maybe even recently, you picked up a hitcher and, after seeing this film, you won't do that again any time soon. That's how much of an impression this excellent film-noir will make on you. This flawlessly acted & directed thriller sustains a uniquely tense atmosphere from start to finish, and this without reverting to explicit violence or dreadful clich√©s. Inspired by the real-life murder case of Billy Cook, the plot centers on merciless serial killer Emmett Myers, who hitchhikes on the quiet roads of rural America but coldly executes the people that are kind enough to offer him a ride. As the list of casualties dramatically increases and police forces get to close on his tail, Myers hijacks one last car to escape into Mexico. The unfortunate passengers are Roy Collins and Gilbert Bowen, two buddies on their way for a fishing weekend. Myers continuously holds them at gunpoint, even sleeping with one eye open, and makes perfectly clear they aren't supposed to survive the journey. Amazingly realistic in The Hitch-Hiker is the depiction of Roy and Gilbert's behavior. Even though they have nothing to lose, they always obey their hijacker and live in fear for him. Perhaps it's because the director is a woman, but there's absolutely no macho nonsense or tough dialogs going on here. Myers is the guy with the gun and certainly not afraid to use it, so you obey his every command. William Talman's performance as the maniac is simply perplexing! With his odd eyes, monotonous voice and overall nihilistic world perspective, he definitely makes one of the scariest villains in the history of film-noir cinema. Top recommendation, don't miss it.

At the same time, a fugitive serial killer (William Tallman) is hitch-hiking and killing his way across the country.  They intersect in the desert, just before the Mexican border. He hijacks and holds them hostage on an odyssey into hell.  We follow them deeper and deeper into the beautiful, but hostile desert as Tallman seems to outwit the authorities time and again. They become more and more terrified as he becomes more and more psycho.  He displays a kind of pure malice and cruelty that makes your skin crawl.  Example  He forces one of the buddies to shoot the glass out of the other's hand.  His evil character has a drooping right eye.  While preparing to sleep around a campfire, he dares the captives to guess whether he is awake or asleep.  They guess wrong - he kills them.  The viewer takes this trip across the desert with them, all the way to their final destination, and the climax of this exciting film.  It is easy to see why Ida Lupino, was considered one of the premier film noir directors.  Her concept of the fishing buddies, courageous, proud, but terrified reaches right down into our guts.  But it is her balanced vision of the evil, intelligent, unpredictable killer that defines the film.  This is a keeper.  If you like it - and how could you not - try Split Second.  There is a curious coincidence between these two films.  Both were directed by famous and respected actors.  This by Ida Lupino and the other by Dick Powell.

Well-directed by Ida Lupino; it was powerful without a lotta trappings. Simple story, inexpensive exterior shooting, and tight acting. Starred William Talman (the bungling D.A. of Perry Mason), Frank Lovejoy, and... Edmund O'Brien.Never was much a fan of the early O'Brien-- he doesn't pull off the toughness he tries for, so I was on-guard for some over-acting from him. No worries this time, for the most part. But TALMAN was the great surprise! Wow! What happened to his career after this film?? He was terrific in this role.His villain wasn't one of those super-intelligent, epitome-of-evil psychos. He's not an exotic, like Hannibal Lecter. Nor did Talman act like one of those oh-so-polite sorts. (As if it makes them more menacing to have nice manners when they threaten you. Think Goldfinger.)No, Talman was effective as a more true-to-life sort.. the kind that seems more menacing to me as a viewer, because you really might run into this bastard.  The only politeness he showed to his victims was to offer them a cigarette. And when he was feeling pleased with himself for nearing the end of his escape, he bought them a beer.Talman's character was a pushy sadist, but never tried to spice it up by pretending to be nice. His ugly game of target practice was evil-- he held one guy at gunpoint and made him shoot a rifle at his friend, who was forced to hold up a tin can. (I don't think this is too much of a spoiler.)He wasn't a Brainiac, just had a talent for staying in control, keeping a never-closing vigilante eye (his creepy-looking right eye wouldn't close when he slept, so his hostages never knew when to try anything). He invested all his energy into avoiding capture.Lovejoy and O'Brien worked well together as the Normal Joes who happened to pick up the wrong guy.  Again, because they're more true-to-life, you can identify with them better than a hard-boiled detective.Realistic location shooting also makes this simple story more powerful. Lupino deserves credit as a film-maker, and I'm glad she's being recognized more and more.

No fat. No melodrama. Nobody trying to get home in time to save the crippled kid. Just a lean and mean treat &#150; as the police-style narration promises us, 70 minutes of true crime suspense.The plot is as straight and narrow as they come. Two war buddies (Frank Lovejoy and Edmund O'Brien) decide to detour south to the Mexican border to make their vacation more interesting (possibly a nudie show or two) and get far more action than they bargained for when they pick up a psychotic prison escapee (William Talman) who holds them hostage. The film's big gimmick is the fact that the hitch-hiker has one paralyzed eye, so that the two hostages can't tell when he's sleeping or awake to make a break for freedom. Considering how cheap this device sounds it actually works extremely well under the direction of Lupino and Talman's performance. As he tries to make his way to freedom across the Mexican deserts, the hitch-hiker drags these two All-American types with him and engages in sadistic games for his own amusement like having one of them hold a tin can while the other shoots it out of his hand with a rifle. After trying to escape together several times the hitch-hiker makes the film's most profound statement by taunting the 2 friends you could have escaped if you didn't worry about each other (or words to that effect).Apparently there is some controversy over whether this film should be called a film noir. It's been in the public domain for many years and has been included on a lot of film noir collections sold at bargain prices, and presumably some viewers have been disappointed by this film's lack of the usual things you see in a film noir. Now first of all their complaints should be directed at the people who labeled the DVD instead of the people who made the movie 20 years before the term film noir even existed. Now is this just a semantic question? Yes and no. Ultimately it doesn't matter what we call the film. It's a suspense film, basically. In other words a film with a more or less set outcome where the audience spends the whole time worrying about how and not what. There seems to be a disturbing trend with this film and some others, that I've gathered over the years reading comments, to hold these movies to some kind of extrinsic standard, a set of values totally alien to the film itself. The film does not have a femme fatale. OK, it doesn't have any women period. It has no dark semi-Gothic melodrama. Perhaps most noticeably it does not take place in the dimly lit alleyways of urban America. Hence some film noir fans have chosen to deride the movie for its perceived deficiencies and to declare it lacking based on a strange confluence of out-of-control marketing (the chronic use of the word noir to sell videos) and narrow genre rules for a genre that never actually existed. Still others seem to stray in the opposite direction, considering any film noir that employs expressionistic photographic devices that were in common usage far back in the silent era. Instead of all this we should look at the film for what it is and only consider it in terms of noir as far as it helps us to understand the piece in relation to contemporary films of the 40s and 50s.The most unusual aspect of the film in my opinion is its total lack of dramatic pretense aka melodrama. The meat of the film is in the 2 men's relationship and the way that the criminal interloper throws that friendship into relief. Superficially speaking they are innocent while he is guilty. But what's interesting in the film is the way that the mere presence of this evil person brings out the weakness and corruption of the 2 friends. The hitch-hiker's comment about how the 2 men could have escaped separately but were held back by their friendship implies, as do many of his off-hand insulting comments, that the 2 men are soft and corrupted by civilization and that the hitch-hiker himself is a stronger man because he does anything he wants to do. However when one of them asks him have you ever had a gun pointed at you it's a subtle reminder that both of these men are war veterans and that they might have a much greater understanding of power and fear than the criminal could ever possess. In this way the film addresses broader issues of the post-war American man in terms of how he sees himself and how others in society may see him. It digs into the insecurity that the domestication and suburbanization of the post-war culture brought to many veterans. And as far as I'm concerned this is prime film noir territory.So if you're strictly interested in traditional tough guys like Mike Hammer and Philip Marlowe, or if you insist on the standard good girl vs. bad girl melodrama (aka femme fatale) then you probably won't get what you're looking for from this movie. But if you're interested in the broader themes of the corruptive influence of civilization that many noir films explore then this film is a novel way to see these themes expressed. It's a very well-made film &#150; although not hugely ambitious, when taken on its own terms the film does have something to say about modern life.

With Emmett holding the two friends at gun point, he forces them to drive deeper into Mexico &#150; all the time making it very clear that they are only alive while he needs them alive and not any longer.The opening caption informs us that this is based on a true story and also tries to engage the audience by pointing out how the couple in the car could have been you (or the people across the aisle). Really though it needn't have bothered with either because the caption doesn't add a great deal. It may be based on a true story but it didn't seem like it was interested in this beyond using the facts as a frame for the story and personally I didn't think it needed to try and put me into the car because Ida Lupino did that well enough by herself. The story is simple and it is to the director's credit that she holds it together so well. Yes it is short by modern standards but she should not lessen how well she has brought out a constant sense of tension whether it be in the tight confines of the car or in the desperate bleak openness of the desert.She is helped by a strong trio of performances from actors who appear to be punching above their weights. Although they haven't a huge amount of depth in their characters they do convince in the realms of tension and fear. The friendship between O'Brien and Lovejoy is solid and helps to support the slightly weak element of the script which is that they never seem to even considering leaving the other for even a second. Talman is memorable in the title role, easily building a screen of menace before allowing the cracks to show.A pretty good film then. It trades on atmosphere and tension, both of which Ida Lupino works with really well. The actors maybe don't have depth to trade on but they respond well to the tone of delivery and give suitably good performances.

It stars Edmond O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy & William Talman. Nicholas Musuraca photographs the film and Leith Stevens scores the music.This is the true story of a man and a gun and a car. The gun belonged to the man. The car might have been yours, or that young couple across the aisle. What you will see in the next seventy minutes could have happened to you. For the facts are actual.The above opening salvo from the film is not without merit, tho due to the Hays Office requirements Lupino had to tone down her initial plans for the film. The story is based on the true story of murderer Billy Cook, who in 1950 posed as a hitch-hiker and murdered a family of five and a travelling salesman. The film picks up with the aftermath of that, where Cook then kidnapped two friends out hunting and forced them at gunpoint to drive him across the border into Mexico. Lupino researched her subject well, even interviewing the principals in the kidnapping.Something of a cult favourite these days, The Hitch-Hiker is a brisk, lean and tight film showing how to get the maximum amount of suspense out of the simplest of set-ups. Practically a three character piece, the film thrives on claustrophobia and an impending sense of dread. Even when the characters come out of the confines of the car, we still feel stifled during the sequences that feature the men out in the desert. There's a sense of desolation in the landscape that marries up with the emotional state of our two kidnapped men. It's fine work by Lupino, who never lets the mood slip. She in turn is aided considerably by her writers and Musuraca's photography. The former cleverly only lets the kidnapped men's personalities unfold once they are seized by Talman's psychopath, the latter brings film noir agoraphobia to the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, location A place that was often shown to be gorgeous in many a fine Western in the 50s.All three lead actors do good work under Lupino's direction, with Talman particularly menacing, all lazy eye and snarly grins. While Stevens' music sits nicely with the tone of the story. Credit Lupino, too, for not letting her male driven movie contain any machismo posturing, or heaven forbid, testosterone fuelled bravado. Where the film does fall down is with its rather anti-climatic finale. For although the real life finale involving Billy Cook was genuinely mundane, the film's ending is also a bit of a damp squib. It's one of those cases where some poetic licence wouldn't have gone amiss. Still, it's far from a deal breaker, the film remains a taut and moodily enjoyable experience. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Making the Most from the Basics of Fear and Helplessness","Date":"17 July 2009","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" The Hitch-Hiker (1953)Making the Most from the Basics of Fear and HelplessnessTruly low budget and yet a fully-realized, well acted, well directed drama. It's tense, the location work in Mexico is fabulous (and dusty and forlorn), and the basic plot is chilling.Director Ida Lupino proves that she, like Orson Welles, can make a top tier movie with the cards stacked against her. While not cinematically daring or original (like Welles), The Hitch- Hiker is tough, smart, stark, and compelling. It has no gaps, no gaffes, and except for one American cop seen a couple brief times, no sorry acting. And the end is a thrilling rush that makes the steady build-up of worry all the more necessary. There are three main actors involved, and all three play their roles with gritty realism. You want to shout at them sometimes to do something different, but you know that you might not if you were in their shoes. That things eventually go wrong is inevitable, but it makes sense. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca (Spiral Staircase and Clash by Night) deserves some of the kudos here for making an ordinary scenario work visually. And the tight script helps, too, so tight that many scenes have little or no dialog, and Lupino gets co-credit for the writing. It's interesting that such a male movie, dominated by men to the point that there are essentially no women in it at all, was directed by a woman. But clearly she knows what the threat of violence can bring to an innocent person, and how escape and survival is not easy at gunpoint.

The killer, played well by William Talman, forces the two men to drive him to a city. There, the police catch him. That's the story....and it drags. The film just has too many parts in which nothing happens and the plot has too many holes in it to sustain credibility. For instance, the killer had this creepy droopy eye that was always open, so they couldn't tell if he was sleeping or not, but when he did go to sleep, he still held on tightly to his gun as he held it out pointed to his captors! Anyway, to its credit, there were some tense moments and the acting was good. (The two good guys were veteran actors Edmund O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy) and the photography was decent.

The fact that it has a short running time, a lively pace and a no-nonsense style of delivering the action, adds to the urgency of what's happening on-screen and emphasises that the events taking place have a momentum all of their own and that they're propelling the hitch-hiker's helpless victims towards a dreadful fate that they have no hope of escaping.Roy Collins (Edmond O'Brien) and Gilbert Bowen (Frank Lovejoy) are a couple of guys from Arizona who plan to enjoy a short fishing vacation in Mexico but en route they see a man at the side of the road and offer him a lift. Almost as soon as he's seated in the car, the stranger, who is Emmett Myers (William Talman), pulls a gun on the men and wants them to take him through the Mexican desert to Santa Rosalia where he intends to catch a ferry. It soon becomes apparent that Myers is a serial killer who's on the run from the police and a radio report that they hear during their journey confirms that the police don't know his current whereabouts.When night falls and the men settle down to sleep, Myers informs his hostages that, due to a deformity of his eyelid, his right eye remains open when he's sleeping and so they should forget about trying to escape because he's likely to see and kill them if they attempt anything like that. Knowing what a ruthless killer Myers is, Roy and Gil don't make any attempt to escape that nightThe journey across the desert becomes increasingly difficult and Myers gets very agitated when the car horn starts to blast continuously and is upset again later when one of the tyres is punctured. In his more composed moments he shouts orders at his terrified captives and tells them that they're soft and that he's superior to them because he simply takes whatever he wants. In the rare opportunities that they get, Roy and Gil try to discuss an escape plan but this causes disagreements between them. Because of this and Myers' promise that he's going to kill them as soon as they arrive at Santa Rosalia, their need for some way out of their predicament becomes increasingly desperate.This movie is intended to create an atmosphere of fear and this is successfully achieved because-1. its story is inspired by real-life events. 2. the ruthlessness of the killer is powerfully portrayed at the very beginning of the film.3. Myers' shooting skills are demonstrated to his victims at an early stage of their journey. 4. his practice of sleeping with one eye open is extremely creepy.Furthermore, locating the victims' ordeal in the claustrophobic confines of a car and the isolation of long empty desert roads highlights the fact that there's no easy escape from Roy and Gil's hellish ordeal.Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy are very convincing in their roles as a couple of ordinary middle-class friends and William Talman is absolutely sensational as Myers, who is the personification of pure evil. With its punchy dialogue, moody visual style and intensely threatening atmosphere, The Hitch-Hiker is an incredibly strong, riveting and memorable crime thriller.

UNDERRATED & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","Date":"12 October 2008","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" DURING the post World War II period of the late 1940's and early '50's, the movie industry found itself in an extreme position of flux. Newly found competition from the Small Screen world of Commercial Television was making inroads into the iron grip held over the American Public's viewing habits. Many who would have previously gone two or more times weekly found their Movie Nights cut severely; in deference to the likes of Sgt. Joe Friday in DRAGNET, a young up and comer named Jackie Gleason on CAVALCADE OF STARS and Groucho Marx's YOU BET YOUR LIFE.LOCAL Neighborhood Movie Theatres, which had previously changed their playbills up to three times weekly cut back to twice weekly and ultimately once; with perhaps some variant Juvenile Western, Cartoon & Serial laden Saturday Matin√©e programming for the Kiddie Trade. The production of so many of theB Films series, short subjects and newsreels were seriously cutback; with the leftover studio space & time, ca$h funding and producing efforts put into the filmed TV Series.UNFORTUNATELY, many a fine film and virtuoso, career defining performances were not seen nearly as widely as movies produced in the previous decades of Hollywood History. Peter Graves, for example, made reference to his pivotal role in Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 (Paramount). He related in an interview during his hey days of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV Series (CBS) for TV Guide that in an earlier day, that role would have earned an Oscar Nomination; but people just weren't going to the movies as before. (We have obviously paraphrased him here.) CAUGHT up in this cinematic tumult was Director Ida Lupino's THE HITCH-HIKER (The Filmmakers/RKO Radio Pictures, 1953). The combination Crime, Latter Day Horror, Noir, Thriller film would certainly have been received and reviewed as being on par with the likes of THE NAKED CITY, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and WHITE HEAT.ANOTHER casualty of the crunch was the proper recognition of the Directorial prowess of Ida Lupino. The very lovely (Woo,woo,woo,woo!) Miss Lupino was one Movie Star whose beauty matched-up and compared most favorably with her other talents as Actress, Writer and Director. After a relatively small number of Theatrical Films, though, she channeled her efforts to direction of TV Series Episodes; no doubt at least in part due to the 1950's Silver Screen Doldrums.OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.In THE HITCH-HIKER, we have a straight forward telling of a modern day Post War Horror Story. Two business men buddies, Gilbert Bowen and Roy COllins (Frank Lovejoy and Edmund O'Brien), while on a fishing vacation in Mexico, are confronted by a sociopathic serial robber-killer & escaped convict, Emmett Myers (William Talman*); who is posing as a disabled motorist by the roadside, when he is spotted by the pair. Once gaining their confidence and entrance as a third passenger to their car, he quickly brandishes his revolver and takes over.THE rest of the film deals with the three's journey to a Mexican town called Santa Rosita; where the Psycho plans to take off on his own to another destination; across the Gulf of California; traveling alone of course. That's it and that's all.BUT never think that there's no substance to this movie, for that is far from the truth. The storyline follows the machinations of the demented mind of the killer and his delight in torturing his captives in just about every way that was permitted on the 1950's screen. Unlike a true, purebred Film Noir feature, there is a happy resolution to the story. True to Life, the Killer is exposed as a yellow-bellied coward of a pathetic excuse for a human being in the end.AND that, my friends, is almost a universally true fact concerning all of these tough guy, Bad Assed types; right down to today. Isn't that right, Schultz? NOTE * The trio turned in top flight performances, with William Talman (best known for his role as L.A. District Attorney, Hamilton Berger on the PERRY MASON Series.) would certainly have to be considered for an Oscar Nomination. Mr. Talman did perhaps his greatest and most selfless performance in a minute public service spot for the Anti Smoking cause in 1968. In it he narrates the happenings and the family members around his own household and how he would regret never being able to see them again. At the end of the spot, a title card announced the date of William Talman's death, due to lung cancer; contracted largely from cigarette smoking.NOTE In addition to the fine interplay between the three principal actors (O'Brien, Lovejoy and Talman), the movie is stocked with a phenomenal number of great supporting players, such as Wendell Niles, Clark Howatt and Natividad Vacio (the personal friend of George Reeves.) The one Mexican uniformed Policeman looks like the lead Bandito, whose gang and him all get gunned down by payroll guards Butch & Sundance in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (20th Century-Fox, 1969); but we cannot find him listed in either films' credits.

Its almost total focus is on two people Roy Collins & Gilbert Bowen, Edmond O'Brien & Frank Lovejoy, involvement in a kidnap and escape attempt across the US/Mexican border. With death in the person of serial killer Emmett Myers, William Talman, riding in the backseat of their automobile.Based on the true story of serial killer Billy Cook who during his short but deadly reign, 1950-51, of terror on the California highway system murdered six unsuspecting motorists who were unlucky enough to run into him and to give him a ride. Captured in Mexico and extradited back to the US Cook was tried and convicted of multiple murder and sentenced to death in the San Quentin gas chamber and executed on December 12, 1952; some five months before the story of his violent and criminal life The Hitch-Hiker was released in the US movie-houses.Driving down at night to the Mexican/California border on a fishing trip Roy & Gilbert Pick up a stranger on the highway hitching a ride. Before they can ask him where he's going he, wanted serial killer Emmett Myers, pulls out a gun introduces himself as a wanted and dangerous murderer and has the two startled men take him toward the Mexican border. Myers not only plans to make his escape but, when Roy & Gilbert are no longer of any use to him, murder them.Driving through the almost empty and broiling desert it's Mayers plan to reach the coastal town of Santa Rosalia. From there Myers is get a ferry ride into Mexico proper where he can disappear from the perusing California state and Mexican police. At first going along with Myers thinking that by doing what he tells them Myers will spare their lives Joe & Gilbert soon realize that he'll murder them as soon as he's free to make his escape. The two then try to somehow storm and disarm and even, if they have to, kill the clever and cunning fugitive. Myers in fact has all the bases covered with not only his smarts and his ability to keep the two at a safe distance from him but also give them the impression that he never sleeps! Myers' right eye, due to some kind of birth defect, never stays closed even when he's out cold and nearly unconscious.Driving for days and avoiding the police roadblocks take a toll on Roy's car where it has to be abandoned in the desert and thus have him and his friend Gilbert and Myers travel on foot to Santa Rosalia. It's here where the movie gets a bit confusing when you start to realize that Myers by now didn't really need both Roy & Gilbert to make his way to Mexico. Myers even had Roy, who was his size and looked somewhat like him, change clothes with him to make the Mexican police think that Roy was really him the fugitive serial killer. Couldn't Myers just have murdered both Roy and Gilbert and take their money and then go to the Santa Rosalia ferry himself? Without having them be forced to tag along with him and put himself, like he eventually did, in danger of being caught?The ending of the movie was about the only flaw in it with Mayers totally losing control of the situation and having the Mexican police get the drop on him. This all happened when the cops saw his wanted poster and the fear on the faces of both his victims. In a wild shootout on the docks as Myers is gunned down as he tried to make his escape masquerading around as the innocent and almost hysterical Roy Collins. 38 year old actor William Talman looking his age, even though he was supposed to be ten years younger in the movie, and chillingly effective as the cold-blooded and unblinking eyed psycho Emmett Myers easily stole the acting honors in The Hitch-Hiker. It's hard to believe that he would later be playing the cool calm genteel and very law minded district attorney Berger, who almost never won a case, on the popular TV court show Perry Mason.

Ida Lupino's tough little programmer about two men, Roy Collins & Gilbert Bowen(Edmond O'Brien & Frank Lovejoy)who pick up killer Emmett Myers(William Talman, who is really intense and creepy in this role;very effective portrayal of a remorseless monster). He holds them captive with a pistol always in his hand. Control is his drug and wielding his weapon brings a rush he often parlays through mind-games..especially with Collins who is more fragile than tough-minded Bowen who is able to keep his mind centered on their freedom at the right moment of surprise. This film follows them through the Mexican desert and mountainous plain(the location work is as much a reason why this film is so successful as the very good leads)while we wonder how our unfortunate captives will or will not survive. A little eerie touch to the film is that Talman's Myers has an eye that doesn't shut so at night it makes it harder for our heroes to determine whether or not he's asleep.Above everything this film is a psychological thriller between psychopath and his hostages. He relishes having them under his power with no real way to escape without harming one or the other. Collins and Bowen could easily betray each other's trust and run for it, but this film shows the character they have. They are flawed people(as Myers often pokes at them..why didn't they go to Arizona like they were supposed to?)who are faced with this ever-growing knowledge that at anytime he could kill them. That tension is really what makes this film so very good. The trials of the place they inhabit is also a major theme as that harsh sun and dust beats down on them after their car goes on the fritz. They are always having to elude capture because of that blasted gun aiming for their bodies.We also see how the Mexican police cooperate with US authorities to find Myers..that is also showed by Lupino is great detail. The film is thrilling to watch..Lupino really made a humdinger of a film here. The three leads really only bring an added professionalism to this film making it more than just a cheap B-film.

This something that, apart from this sub-genre, maybe only western can create so aptly, but with western we are always attached to the meaning of the films western film is viscerally linked to a certain American vision of values, moral and ethics, and its Italian connection, to cinema itself, meta-narrative.But the road-trip is free from so many conventions. They come in all shapes and sizes. So you can produce a road-trip movie in anyway, without being forced to obey the laws of a genre, because in the end, it's not one.So we have the Bonnie and Clyde, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, My blueberry nights. Each a very shiny light in its own cinematic galaxy. Each creates its own rules.But what works all the time as a key element in these films, and what it shares with western, is how it invites the filmmaker to shoot wilderness, wide spaces, infinite roads, to portrait solitude, inner voyages, personal dramas. That's the one thing that makes the film live or die.This one lives. I have a growing admiration for Ida Lupino. A woman in the job mostly done by men. Giving us new versions of masculine genres. Feminine intimate calculation placed against (and over) men's intuitions and symbols. This is a film with no relevant female characters. She delivers, I think, a kind of deeper version of this genre, specially compared with the generality of films done in these days, when the medium was not so developed as to allow emotion to be shown from such an inside point of view.So here we have a film of tension, instead of violence. The promise of the next thing that will happen is always superior to the perspective of actually seeing that. And that's what builds the shape of the film the next thing. Talman gives us a very fair version for his typical character, more remarkable if we think it was still given when Brando hadn't broken the rules for cinema acting. And naturally, a film like this necessarily depends in important parts on the performance of the actors. So this is a film of sketched but unfulfilled actions, tension as opposed to realizations. The promise of the next landscape, the next town always mirrors the evaluation of the situation by each of the 3 characters.

He gives an excellent performance as a terrifying, volatile killer. Definitely his best role; sadly, he succumbed to lung cancer two years after Perry Mason ended. O'Brien and Lovejoy, usually two tough guys in films, are great as ordinary men in an extraordinary circumstance. When Lovejoy sees a little girl, he thinks of his own daughter and hugs the child, crying Vaya con Dios, fearing that he will never see his daughter again.My only complaint is that there were endless long shots of the car driving down the road; you could almost predict when they were coming up.

But Ida Lupino, in one of her earlier, smaller works as a film director, is really keen on getting this story told very tightly, and she makes it lean and exciting for the 70 minutes it unfolds. Very simple set-up a serial killer, played by William Talman, kills the people that pick him up as he hitchhikes, and when he gets picked up by two guys (Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy), he thinks he's got it set to head on deep down into Mexico where no one will catch up with him. In the meantime, he forces everything on the men by gun-point, is paranoid even when things should be looking good, and because of one eye that never closes all the way, the tension and suspense is always on high for the two men in the night as they can never tell if their hitch-hiker is asleep or eying them like an all too trigger-happy hawk.What unfolds then is material that could just as easily be found in a western of a similar fold, despite it being claimed that it's based on a true story (the 'loosely' term more so applies, even with the naturalistic impulses of the director). But it's this very simple edge, the kind that makes up the better B-movies, that is interesting once seen under the film-noir scope of things. Some of Lupino's shots are very creative in the mood she's trying to convey, like when Meyers first gets into the car and he's completely in shadow, and then for the first time we see his face it's after the gun comes out, and it's kind of frightening. In fact, one of the bits of genius Lupino had was to use Talman as Myers- he has one of the best villain-noir faces I've seen, with hair usually askew, his crooked eye, his face always as grim as can be but always determined to have his way. It's interesting too to see how the simplistic psychology- of Meyers being basically abandoned and on his own as a child and always taking things instead of having them given to him- is laid out at times when in the little moments with his two men. One scene I really got intrigued by was when Meyers had Bowen (Lovejoy, who is probably the more emotionally charged of the two, if not overall the better actor) hold a can up out in the desert to shoot at, and the demand that Collins shoot at the can. The mind-games aren't raised very high, as Myers is too neurotic and pathological to stay on one thing for too long, but it's little moments that strike up the best parts of the picture.Sure, the procedural moments are sort of routine, like seeing how the police dish out the disinformation about Myers whereabouts to keep him on the move, and the ending is only satisfactory in really getting some extra grit out of the prediction. But the atmosphere and the interplay and performances of the three main men of the Hitch-Hiker is what's always absorbing. I loved seeing the wide-open vista shots of the desert, and the little asides with the close-ups given to Myers. Lupino grabs what she can with the picture because she knows what it is- but more importantly knows how to put some individual touches to the framework. It's assuredly not the work of a usual craftsman, but a professional trying for that extra bit of tension, that extra bit of style, in whatever budget she had. And if anything I'll try and seek out not only more of her work- particularly in the male-dominated noir world that she somehow seems to operate in so well- but for Talman too in villainous roles. 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"A superb, gripping and suspenseful 50's film noir thriller gem","Date":"21 August 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" Gilbert Bowen (finely played by Frank Lovejoy) and Roy Collins (the equally excellent Edmund O'Brien) are a couple of pleasant, personable working class family men who are out on a fishing trip driving across Mexico in a Plymouth Fury.

A former film noir star, Lupino brings several interesting directing touches to the film such as the initial obscuring of the hitchhiker's face until he produces his gun, but it is William Talman's unhinged performance as the hitcher that really makes the film. He has a creepy calmness to him as he holds the two men hostage like something that he has done millions of times before, and his face more than his gun oozes menace. Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy are, on the other hand, dull as his two victims; the film momentarily brings up something about them lying to their wives about their trip, but the most part, their function in the script is simply to (unsuccessfully) attempt to escape and evade again and again. The film grows a tad repetitive as it goes on, and with constant cutaways to the US and Mexican police investigating the matter, it never really maintains any tension that it builds. The film is also a less thrilling experience since we constantly know that the police are on top of things and have a plan of what to do, and the despair of the fishing buddies never really resonates since the movie provides a strong sense that everything will work out.

Hence it has some historical interest. However, it is by no stretch of the imagination in the film noir genre, as many suggest. Classic film noir involves urban settings, a motley crew of criminals and their associates, a double and preferably a triple cross, a femme fatale, lots of rain and dark shadows, and a hero who enters into the underworld reluctantly and inadvisedly. Although no film noir classic has all of these conventions, most have a great many. This film has none. It does have great film noir cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca ( Stranger on the 3rd Floor, Cat People, Out of the Past, They Clash By Night, The Blue Gardenia) and he does use some of his sharp black and white photography to make this a very watchable film.Don't expect film noir, nor will you get much psychological analysis of the spree killer. The performances are good and the direction is taut, but there are far better films from this era, and certainly people like Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy did far better jobs in far better films.

We know it, when it happens by the shadows, the music score, the sharp instincts of director Ida Lupino. In fact, despite the fact Ms. Ida Lupino directed several other films, this is considered to her best. This has everything a film noir should have strong characters, pace, the great use of black and white cinematography, suspense, and a scary bad guy. A femme fatale is good, but not necessarily needed, as there is not one in sight here. But who has time to think about that! With a guy in the back seat ready to slit your throat, this delivers a wallop of intense emotions and activity. Sure, there's a lot of talking between the three men, but you're never bored. The only critique is that the climax happens so quickly and rather matter-of-factly. Then it's over, the end. You'll be entertained by this little but loud film, directed by actress Ida Lupino.

Lupino also pens this strange and true tale of a serial killer on the loose. With a entire Male Cast, Ida sets forth on-loan by Warners to RKO, she shot the entire Picture on-location. Beginning to finish a breathtaking 71 minutes, Lupino comes in under-budget and several days early. Hollywood forgetful of its hugely successful past of Female Directors and Screenwriters such as the incredible Francis Marion (The Big House), Lupino is scorned upon and RKO acts like they are hiding from this production. A Limited Release does not help box office totals although the Movie does make its money back. She had a very slim budget of $400,000 and had to invent rotoscope camera movements for the Camera Automobile shots because of lack of equipment available. Surely influenced by the drama she herself displayed on the screen as the Star opposite Humphrey Bogart in High Sierra she Directs with complete confidence and a totally believable natural reality driven style and turns the killer Emmet Myers (William Talman) into one of the most vicious murderous monsters the screen had ever seen. But there is something else happening as well; -Ida gives the film a sense of purpose and sensitivity even with all the madness going on throughout...In an interview Talman recalled an incident that happened shortly after the release of The Hitch-Hiker (1953), in which he gave a chilling portrayal of escaped murderer and serial killer Emmett Meyers. He was driving his convertible in Los Angeles with the top down, and he stopped at a red light. Another driver in a convertible who was stopped next to him stared at him for a few seconds, then said, You're the hitchhiker, right? Talman nodded, indicating that he was. The other driver got out of his car, went over to Talman's car and slapped him across the face, then got back in his car and drove off. In recalling the story, Talman said, You know, I never won an Academy Award but I guess that was about as close as I ever will come to one.The Hitch-Hiker is instrumental is guiding the fantastic career of Ida Lupino whom was a beloved Star of the golden era of Hollywood's Silver Screen. And moved forward to Producing and Directing right into the golden age of Television. There was nothing Lupino could not do and do well. Ida Lupino was the first woman to Direct Film Noir although the word Classic here may not totally apply to The Hitch-Hiker but for a Industry that today only employs a tragic 1% of Females we should look closer of the Film's that early Hollywood based Women Directed, Wrote and Produced.

It's a straightforward three-hander in which a couple of buddies (Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy) are accosted by a manic serial killer (William Talman), who forces them to drive him to Mexico in order for him to escape the authorities.This is a low budget, black and white suspense thriller that has more tension in it than a dozen recent movies. The low budget works in its favour, with tight camera angles making for a claustrophobic viewing experience. Actress Ida Lupino certainly knows what she's doing behind the camera as she rarely puts a foot wrong here the pacing is exact and the performances are excellent.While O'Brien and Lovejoy ground the movie playing the two protagonists, but in reality this is Talman's turn. He gives a pitch perfect turn as the creepy villain, one that would pave the way for later screen psychos like Robert Mitchum's character in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Talman's acting is the stuff of brilliance, and he alone makes the film worth watching. The rest of it is the icing on the cake.

The Hitch-Hiker is one of the first ones and it's actually the first film-noir directed by a woman - so the film has quite a lot of historic value. British for her descent, Ida Lupino had already some experience of film-noir she had starred in High Sierra (1941) with Humphrey Bogart and later on in On Dangerous Ground (1953) by Nicholas Ray. The Hitch-Hiker is very unconventional and daring, it borough up subjects many would've left behind but Ida Lupino was no coward. She openly and realistically dealt with themes like illegitimate mothers, twice married chumps, rapes and the consequences of it in her movies. In The Hitch-Hiker she took film-noir into her hands and shaped something of her own out of it.Two men are going out of town for fishing. During their journey to Arizona they pick up a hitch-hiker from the road, who quickly turns out to be a psychopath who is being searcher by the police. The agonizing journey starts in a narrow car when the men are forced to change their direction from Arizona to Mexico and realize that they're facing death. The only question is when and how.In 1950's film-noir was quite a phenomenon of the past and filmmakers had taken everything out of it that they were able to; at least that's what they thought. Private eyes, dangerous women and desperate men were characters everyone were familiar with. Big cities, cold streets, waterfronts and exotic milieus were landscapes all had seen. Desperation, loveless love, exploitation and moral complexity were themes filmmakers had dealt with for several times. In 1950's many brought something new to this amazing genre; Nicholas Ray gave us a chance to see it in a very different landscape, Orson Welles took the whole philosophy of film-noir to a new level in Touch of Evil (1958) and Alfred Hitchcock dealt with a true story in The Wrong Man (1956).Ida Lupino as the first woman to direct a film-noir obviously brought something new to it. The aesthetics, landscapes and milieus of film-noir were often related to big cities like Los Angeles and New York. In The Hitch-Hiker Lupino uses the claustrophobic place of a car brilliantly and the scenes outside the car take place in the deserts of southern states and Mexico. The whole film takes place in one car, the gas stations on the road and the deserts of unbearable heat. Only near the end the film culminates to one of the most classical milieus of film-noir a waterfront.The film was very untypical for its time. It portrayed two men in a true nightmare with no way out. The world view of it is incredibly dark and pessimistic, where the police is powerless against the world. In the beginning of the film it is announced that it is based on a true story, which could've happened to any of us. This of course makes the situation even more distressing and scary. What I know is that where I live, Finland this film was banned back in 1950's because of its darkness, psychopathy and pessimism.The Hitch-Hiker was made in 1950's - in the shadows of The Cold War so the themes of pessimism, disloyalty, paranoia, loneliness and psychopathy were current and hard for the people of the time. Ida Lupino reinforced the place of women as directors in Hollywood, which was seen (and still is) as a very masculine trade. The construction of the claustrophobic place is glorious and the simplified expressionistic images of the shadows of the characters and the endless roads are astonishing and unforgettable.

This film is way better than I was hoping for. William Talman is excellent in his role as the psychotic Hitch-Hiker Emmett Myers.

HITCH&#x97;HIKER is a suspenseful drama (--and, in more recent terms, a road&#x97;movie--), the subject being, like that of Polanski's KNIFE IN THE WATER, ideal for a sparse, low&#x97;budget treatment (--HITCH&#x97;HIKER being a much plainer movie than the Polish one--), the issue of the familial life is present&#x97;the two abducted fellows are married, decent family guys, 'soft' (Mrs. Lupino cosigned the script), the Mexican Policia is presented with respect. And it was labeled as a noir by people who don't know what a noir is, or what should it look like. (To pick another controversially labeled movie&#x97;I can see why SCARLET STREET is a noir, or at least how could it be argued; but such is not the case with Mrs. Lupino's cereal murderer road movie.) O'Brien looks great unshaved, unkempt and in leather; in fact he looked a bit like a childish and funny Bogart. He plays well, of course, but, like in the other role Mrs. Lupino cast him that same year '53, O'Brien tends to overact a bit, to be slightly over&#x97;explicit; anyway, he's always an enjoyable actor&#x97;like Duryea, Mature, Ryan and other male stars of the '40s&#x97;'50s. O'Brien tended to overact, but he tended to be very good as well. All three main performances in this movie are good; even Myers, notwithstanding the creepiness of his character, gives a straight performance. The direction is remarkable&#x97;sparse, terse, economic, straight, clear and robust&#x97;giving the road movie its note of dynamism and excitement. If her sympathies go with the two regular, soft, married men, there is a certain degree of fascination with the loner, the cornered murderer&#x97;but not so as to glamorize him or something&#x97;mainly discovering the sparkle of his evilness.In '53 Mrs. Lupino was a 35 yrs. babe, with the experience of having already directed a handful of other flicks&#x97;in '49, '50, '51, '52; The Bigamist and The Hitch-Hiker were both made in '53, and many years later one other movie followed with her at the director's helm.To retake the comparison with RP's KNIFE IN THE WATER, Lupino's movie is simpler, austere and almost abstract, of a codified realism, while Polanski's oozes with sexuality and involves hidden layers of the mind.Labeling THE H&#x97;H as a noir is begging the question, a _petitio _principii; what makes it a noir? It's not urban; no women, no femme _fatale, no double&#x97;crosses, no back&#x97;biters, no ambiguous, lying, cheating characters, no corrupt or incompetent cops, no wealthy oldster to hire a private eye, no intricate plot, no enigma, no tough and determined protagonist, no denouement, no special cinematography, no architectures of light, no subdued '40s glamor, even no underworld and no city bums. It's as noir as an episode of DALLAS. THE HITCH&#x97;HIKER is atmospheric&#x97;its atmosphere is one of suspense; but why should a cereal killer road movie be a noir?

This is superbly done, and along with the other Lupino films I've seen (The Outrage and The Bigamist) offers strong proof that she was one of the great directors of the early 50s; she builds suspense slowly and steadily -- it's hard to believe the film is only 71 minutes, and not because it is in any way slow -- and her eye for the landscape and for the psychology of fear gives even the obvious rear-projection sequences in the car a feeling of authenticity.Talman's performance and character -- the bum eye that causes a twitch in his face, the sadism, the sick sense of humor and the constant threatening of his companions -- is what is going to stick with most people, though O'Brien and Lovejoy are both fine in rather thankless roles; he is never so over-the-top that he becomes unbelievable, and he is given just enough depth through some vague comments about his past that you can practically trace his decline into insanity. We also are made uneasy enough that we never really are sure how things will turn out, as the captives become more desperate and their captor more crazy -- all the way up until the powerful climax on a pier in a port town in Mexico.

Near the end of the film one of the hostages leaves his wedding ring on the pump at a Mexican gas station, alerting police who save the pair and capture Talman. Lupino's direction is superb as she slowly builds the tension, cleverly selecting her setup shots in remote desert areas. She was the only woman directing films at the time, and she proved her enormous talent as a writer and a director with this taut little thriller. Talman's role is based upon the real-life exploits of mass murderer William Cook who slaughtered six people in 1950-51 before Mexican police captured him; he was executed in San Quentin's gas chamber on December 12, 1951. The story, taken right out of the headlines, was written by Daniel Mainwaring who had written INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. He did not receive credit because of his left-leaning politics during the HUAC witch hunts, and because Howard Hughes, then running RKO, refused to give radicals any credit for film work.----copy right TV guide listing 11-8-2007 "},{"Title":"The Facts are Actual","Date":"28 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" Don't let that Awkwardly Written Opening from the Producers Dissuade You.The Only Women in this Film are Peripheral, but it was Directed by a Woman, Ida Lupino.

The killer first kills a couple, then a single man, but when he picks up two pals going on a 'fishing trip' and realizes they are NOT going where they told their wives... he might just be in the sort of male company he was looking for... hence the reason why he sticks with them instead of just killing them as he did with the other false start pick-ups at the beginning of the film. This hitch hiker wants to be with a male couple. While it is not spelled out, it certainly is there in body language and in some emotional hints. The ring we see left at the gas pump is not a wedding ring, it is a fraternity ring. The Mexican police officer says this in Spanish. After WW2 and after The Korean War many many displaced and sexually confused men who had experiences intimate and grueling male bonding were tipped back into society. The rise of bike gangs is testament to these men who wanted male companionship in leather and uniform platoons began to get noticed in society. This film is a microcosm of that emerging subculture. The couple murdered at the start not the pick up he wanted; the man killed not the man he wanted.

The film is supposedly based on a true story; whether that's true or not is anyone's guess, but the point that the events of this film could happen to anyone (although it's less likely these days after so many 'hitcher' movies!). The plot focuses on two friends; Roy Collins and Gilbert Bowen, who are on a fishing trip. They pull over to pick up a hitch-hiker; but didn't realise that they guy they've just picked up is Emmett Myers; a sadistic criminal on the run from the law. The trio then drive down through Mexico; while the fishermen try to plan an escape.The film this one takes most influence from is obviously 1947's minor masterpiece The Devil Thumbs a Ride (and indeed, the script even includes a nod to the earlier film). I do have to say that the two 'good' lead characters are rather lame; neither of them is particularly interesting and really are only there to allow William Talman to run riot in the villain role. It really is a great performance from Talman, who instills his character with a real sinister atmosphere and ensures that no human element is visible, which is what makes the character so frightening. The setting mostly consists of the open desert; and this ensures that we are always aware of the hopeless situation that the good characters have found themselves in; director Ida Lupino does a very good job of capturing the open planes. I do have to admit that the plot could have been more exciting; it's always interesting, but it could have used more flashpoints to really rev up the tension and capitalise on the unpredictable nature of the villain. Still, this is a tense and effective little thriller and a good way to spend seventy minutes!

There are some good scenes but there is not enough suspense or tension. He has a gun but we are forced to think why he doesn't use it. Surely, he would have just killed the two occupants of the car and stolen the car for himself as he had done on every other previous occasion. Perhaps he liked Roy and Gilbert...??...At the end of the film, I thought it was OK but nothing more. The cast are good and I'll keep the film to watch again.

The acting and the dialog make the main 3 characters believable.One subtlety that is missed by some in the plot is that the two main characters are looking for excitement. They initially are going to the chocolate mountains in AZ and then change their mind and go to Mexicali to drink and womanize. Subconsciously, the hitch-hiker is providing excitement these guys were looking for and initially limits their initiative to escape.The cooperation and devotion to duty displayed by the U.S. and Mexican police is another drawback to the movie. The film would have been better served if there were some friction between the two police branches. Some antagonism between the authorities would have added to the suspense and made the ending less predictable. It would have been interesting to see how the politics would have played out.

That was a big mistake. Talman, with a hideous and slightly deformed face and a voice like Jason Robards, is one of those psychopaths who goes on a murder spree for no particular reason. He pulls a gun and Lovejoy and O'Brien become his captives.Talman plans to take them through the sparsely populated desert of Baja California to the town of Santa Rosalia, then bump the two of them off as he hops the ferry to Guaymas, on the Mexican mainland, where he figures he will elude any police who might be in pursuit.That is, if he figures anything at all. Talman's plans are so ill reasoned that you have to wonder if the guy has any frontal lobes left. As it happens, the policia finally catch up with them and capture Talman, much to the relief of the other two who, by this time, are thoroughly browned off at having been humiliated and abused.Talman is enough to creep anyone out. One eye never closes. So, for the several nights they spend camping together, the others never know whether he's awake or not.It's not a very good movie though. The characters are all one dimensional. The sneering Talman is pure evil. Not engagingly evil either, like Hitchcock's villains. Just nasty and a little sadistic. Lovejoy and O'Brien, two competent actors, are stuck in their roles. We learn practically nothing about them except that O'Brien is impulsive and Lovejoy more thoughtful. Both are unrelentingly morose. With a pistol pointed at your noggin, that's understandable, but even in the first few scenes, before they get into trouble, neither of them seems especially enthusiastic about their vacation, and Lovejoy is positively cranky. The most animated performances come from the Mexican characters they meet, and there aren't many of them.The plot has so many holes in it that it seems cobbled together out of patches and things. Talman tells them that he needs them because he doesn't want to be connected with their car, but that when they get to Santa Rosalia he's going to bump them off. Why does he need them alive to drive to Santa Rosalia? Why not bump them off in the desert and just take the car? It doesn't make sense. It makes even less sense after the car is fatally damaged and they must walk the remaining miles to Santa Rosalia.I understand this is based on historical events and, to the extent that that's true, I'd have to guess that the kidnapper let the real guys live because psychopaths have trouble with impulse control. Circumstances waft their intentions this way and that. The kidnapper might have let them live because he enjoyed their chats or because he felt like having company or because he was too lazy to pull the trigger or because he liked having two plain-vanilla folks to boss around. Like most men who take hostages, Talman has created his own social world consisting of one king and two slaves. And as a poet once said, 'It's good to be da king. Ida Lupino's direction is sufficient -- no more than that, and sometimes less. Example. Lovejoy and O'Brien spend two nights in their sleeping bags while Talman watches over them. The scenes are clumsily staged. Lovejoy and O'Brien are wrapped up to their neck in their dark sleeping bags, as if in swaddling clothes, and they lie rigidly on their backs with their faces up. Who sleeps like that? It's worth seeing once but not worth coming back to. Everything about it seems indifferent. The photographer, Nicholas Musuraca, has worked on some fine noirs but this isn't one of them. Or maybe his work is better than it seems. I watched it on a 5-disk DVD set of Noirs. The quality stinks.

After already committing murders and with the police hot on his trail, the criminal is desperate to escape and becomes more unhinged. Using a gun from the back seat, he forces the two men on a fishing trip to follow his orders. The hitch-hiker Emmett Myers is played by William Talman, who also played prosecuting attorney Hamilton Berger on the Perry Mason television show. Here he shows what a great character actor he is in an earlier role as a psychopath. His acting is superb as he terrorizes and plays cruel games with the two human pawns. This movie was directed by film noir actor Ida Lupino, the first woman to direct a film in this genre. The story was pieced together from newspaper accounts. Edmond O'Brien as Roy Collins and Frank Lovejoy as Gilbert Bowen are well paired with O'Brien acting the hothead Collins and Lovejoy, the cool as a cucumber family man. The drive is one lengthy ordeal and is marked by a few torturous scenes the William Tell target practice; the psychopath's paralytic eye staying open; the walk across the desert when Collins has an injured leg. I am grateful that TCM brings back to the screen an underrated and well-crafted movie like Hitchhiker that could otherwise be forgotten.

He explained after that incident he never stopped to give lifts to young men with long hair and that it inspired him to write his 1977 short story The Hitch Hiker . You have to wonder how much embellishment there is to the story because if Dahl had seen this relatively unknown movie it'd be a warning to anyone picking up hitch hikers This has a simple premise of a raving psycho hitching a life from a couple of hard working regular guys and deciding to kill them when their usefulness is over .

In this case, I sure hope this wasn't close to the real story, as it's very harrowing and I would hate this to have actually occurred! Two guys (Frank Lovejoy and Edmond O'Brien) are on an outing to Mexico. When they see a guy hitching, they stop&#x97;assuming he's had car trouble.

And, unless they get very lucky, these two are bound to be next.While this film has a very simple idea and a relatively low budget, it's a wonderful example of a film which makes the most of what it has. The acting was great (especially William Talman as the nut-case), the script very taut&#x97;all working together to make a wonderful South of the Border version of film noir. Well worth your time&#x97;and a must-see for young filmmakers who need to know you don't need a lot of glitz and bucks to make a great film.

Two friends, a draftsman and a garage operator, are out on the dusty roads of Mexico for a weekend of fishing -- or whatever it is they set out to accomplish. They stop to give a hitchhiker a lift and that's when things get difficult.The man with the gun in the backseat immediately gets a reading on this pair. The draftsman's the smart one. Yep, it was the grease monkey at the wheel who opened the door to Emmett Myers, wanted by the cops for the double-murder of the last couple who gave him a lift.Myers toys with the men like a cat with mice, devising sick games and ordering them to cook and drive for him. As long as he's got the weapons, he has a place in the world, people have to pay him heed. The draftsman indeed seems better able to play along, as his buddy starts to crack.The story resolves inexorably. It's not the plot that startles at the end, but the characterization. Frank Lovejoy as Bowen makes a gesture to come to Myers's aid once he's in the hands of what we cringingly suspect are brutalizing and maybe corrupt Mexican cops.I sat somewhat stunned through the film's final sequences. Its conclusion was powerful yet I wanted something more. To me its utter abruptness didn't quite satisfy. In addition, the version of the film that I saw lacked subtitles. C'mon, Spanish ain't an official language here yet! But this is a minor quibble.I'm tempted to watch this film again to pick up on more of the psychological nuances.

You can see each of them go through separate cycles of comprehension and response and, for my money, I thought they were very much like real persons in their circumstances would be.

The two men are well played by EDMOND O'BRIEN and FRANK LOVEJOY, and you have to wonder if there is a sub-text to their relationship when the killer (WILLIAM TALMAN) tells them You could have escaped if you didn't want to leave each other. But whatever suspense and intrigue the film has is due to the way the plot slowly evolves into a tense cat-and-mouse game between the two men, who desperately want to survive, and the man with one eye that doesn't shut (paralyzed eye) whom they suspect is still watching them around the campfire while he sleeps.The acting is standard for this type of story but neither O'Brien nor Lovejoy is able to dig any deeper than the surface for their characterizations of men anxious about their fate. Based loosely on a true story about a killer who had already done several murders before taking the two men hostage in the desert near Mexico, it's got a certain amount of suspense but is nowhere as tightly structured as it should be for a film that runs a mere 71 minutes.

THE HITCH-HIKER, directed brilliantly by Ida Lupino, was an even greater revelation. THE HITCH-HIKER manages, in just over an hour, and with an economy of motion that Boetticher himself probably appreciated, to tell a terrifying tale of kidnapping and murder. The stage is set early on, with the serial killer Meyers (William Talman, in an outstanding performance) murdering half a dozen people before hitching a ride with O'Brien and Lovejoy. It's clear from the moment they pick him up that their days are numbered, and in a GREAT dramatic scene late in the going, O'Brien beseeches a search plane with arms uplifted, pleading for them to land and save himself and Lovejoy. It's an unusual scene in that it shows a man in fear for his life doing what I've actually seen people in life-threatening situations DO he begs for his life; loudly, and unashamedly. Another fascinating aspect of this movie is Talman as the killer, whose right eye never closes his defective eye makes for some tense and even genuinely funny moments. My favorite is the scene where the two victims stare at him for quite some time trying to determine if he's actually watching them or not before eventually trying to make a run for it- only to have him open his other eye and grin as he watches them run. THE HITCH-HIKER has been ripped off a thousand times over the years, but nobody ever- EVER- did it as well as director Ida Lupino.

The fact that we have so many now does not mean this film doesn't survive the test of time. It only means it's going to be a hidden asset for a while.What is remarkable is the reality of the characters. And yes, this really happened. The people involved were interviewed. Oh, a few liberties were taken, probably to make the film longer, but the characters were very credible.Although they don't go into movie heroics, our kidnapped victims keep their dignity for the most part. The scenes where they lose their cool are perfectly believable.And that's why the film wouldn't be made this way today, which is sad. First of all, these were real actors. Imagine one of the prima donnas of today being told to debase himself the way Edmond O'Brien did? And there probably aren't more than a dozen actors today who are as big a name as O'Brien was then (and still is).O'Brien, Lovejoy, and Talman are nothing short of fantastic, which makes our director and writer nothing short of fantastic, because this is a team effort. The story flows along much quicker than many of the slasher movies of today, with far less action. Why? Clever directing, and all the little things that go into a great film.I felt more akin to the character of O'Brien, who wanted to call the shots for when to make a break, because I didn't think much of Lovejoy's idea of waiting till the maniac made his move. Of course, that's the thing. If you're not there, you really don't know which character you would be like.One could rationalize that it's good that we live in a safe world, where people don't know what this experience is like first hand, where they can fantasize that they could talk or fight their way out of it.I, however, don't think a false sense of security is healthy. If a person sees this, and doesn't see the reality and credibility of the characters, that person is a sitting duck when peril really does come.This is a top film on every level. Still relevant today. And if this film was never seen, and just released today, I'd want the actors, director, and writer all nominated for an academy award.

Anyone who's seen 1986's The Hitcher (with Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell) might think this film from 1953 is the grandfather of all such films.But The Hitch-Hiker is predictable from start to finish.  Two buddies (O'Brien and Lovejoy) decide to head out for a little hanky-panky away from their dreary lives (and wives).  Predictably, they're punished for their straying ways. Before they can begin drinking and fooling around with some hookers, they pick up psycho-killer Emmett Myers (Talman). From that point on (this occurs about 15 minutes into this 70-minute picture), the film is a repetitious series of scenes in which Myers forces the men to get gas, get food, turn on the radio, turn off the radio, stop for the night, etc.The psychological torture of being constantly under the watch of a gun wielded by a madman is the focus of the film. But other pictures have done this better. The Hitch-Hiker doesn't have Myers torturing, beating or humiliating his victims as a lesser film would. But then, the film doesn't make me particularly believe that the things Myers does would make his victims break down the way they do, either.The film's tenor changes about midway. The repetitiveness of the scenes stops, and Myers becomes a much more cunning, clever psychotic -- forcing one of his victims to exchange clothes with him (so the police will shoot at the wrong man), and deciding to avoid the ferry at Santa Rosalia (his point of escape from Baja California to the Mexican mainland) by hiring a boat from a local fisherman. It makes for a more interesting picture.Talman is a fine enough actor, but he isn't given much to do as the evil Myers. The film's moral point (aside from crime doesn't pay) is that the friendship between O'Brien and Lovejoy is what keeps them alive and gets them through it all. Only, neither actor is given much to do or say that would convince the viewer of the bond between them or that it deepens during their ordeal.Much of the dialogue seems stilted (especially Myers' prison/street lingo). Some of the plot elements -- such as they trek through the Baja desert to reach Santa Rosalia -- are downright silly.  But the film's main trick -- Myers' inability to close his bum right eye, which means he can sleep and his victims can never know if he's awake or not -- actually works.In the end, The Hitch-Hiker is a pleasant enough film. But compared to the better noir and suspense films of the 1950s, it is merely a fun diversion. "}]
