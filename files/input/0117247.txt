[{"Title":"Not all romantic comedies are created equal!","Date":"16 October 2004","Score":"38 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I would probably never decide to watch this film, had it not been for my wife who rented the DVD. Just like many others, I expect romantic comedies to be all the same - usually terribly unrealistic (talk about suspension of disbelief!) as in the Pretty Woman, and the humor to be 3rd grade.But, One Fine Day, surprised me in many ways! First, it is not I need insulin right now! sweet. Also it is surprisingly relevant for today's world, and not targeted at teeny boppers.One Fine Day is a film with a very smart script, funny dialogues, beautiful acting, directing, and it all gels well together. Most of the moviegoers today expect blood, gore, darkness of warped minds, and it seems that films which don't have that have a hard time getting a good review. It is time we step back, and enjoy some of the subtleties of life and people, and laugh at ourselves, when it's all presented in a believable and funny way.The film takes us through one fine day of a single mother and her son, and a single father and his daughter. Due to his error, they miss their kids field trip and are, reluctantly, helping each other out take care of kids. While he obviously likes her but has a problem with trusting again, and a questionable flirting tactics, she is more obviously shell shocked and uses every opportunity to put him down. In a single day they both go through so many humbling episodes that the relationship develops from I already have an opinion about you... and So do I... to I'll help you out if you say 'Be my knight in shining armor...'The control freak named Melanie and played wonderfully by Michelle Pfeiffer, manages to stay likable even though she beats every miserable bastard that comes her way to pulp. George Clooney has an easier time being liked as he is his pretty much usual self, and that's exactly what the character requires. Both kids were much better then I would normally expect them to be; I am always put off by artificial adult gestures and too cool for you acting of today's kids in Hollywood films, and expected that this time it would be the same, but it was not.The humor in this film is subtle, and you may actually miss it altogether if you expect things to blow in your face. I loved those brief encounters between Melanie (Pfeiffer) and Celia (Amanda Peet) in which a beautiful perfectionist with a heart (Pfeiffer) meets her less polite match... Amanda Peet was also fantastic! Just notice how Pfeiffer's facial expression changes when she realizes who she's talking to. Another one to watch and enjoy is the episode with Melanie's boss.Also, this film can be watched more then once, as there is a lot to appreciate about it. ps. A scene at the shrink's office made me laugh like never before!

I absolutely love it. I'm not entirely sure why i just find it really sweet and the two stars are both perfectly charming throughout. I used to have this on in the background whenever I did homework. Maybe I was just at that age when I was starting to appreciate romance when I saw it in the cinema (3 times) but I still feel this is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen and would definately recommend it to anyone. It's a great shame that a gem like this is so underrated. ALL of the acting is suberb. George clooney is entertaining as always in this film he made whilst it was still being debated as to whether he could transcend tv and become a movie star.

Over the course of the day they run into countless mishaps and misadventures, and come close together, to understand each other in a sort of non-romantic romantic way.The first time I saw One Fine Day it was 1996 and I was seven years old.  I didn't like it.  I found it tedious and boring.  Now I'm fourteen, and I just finished watching, and I love it?  I get all the jokes I didn't get now, all the clever one-liners spoken with a bright, witty confidence that is reminiscent of Frank Capra films.And clever they are!  I have to say, when you subtract a few (very few) somewhat cheesy lines from the script, it becomes perfect.  I'd go as far as to say Oscar worthy.  Yes, you may think its cheesy that Jack's a famed newspaper columnist bringing down a mob member and the mayor, and Melanie's an architect working on what we imagine is a multi-million dollar deal with big businessmen, but the way it's presented is not that it makes sense, it's that you don't care.  And that's not the focus of the film either, the movie would rather be about the minglings of the two leads.And I have to say, Clooney and Pfeiffer have great, perfect chemistry.  Clooney is his usual cool, intense self whereas Pfeiffer is an uptight, worrisome hard worker.  They play off each other perfectly.  It's not just their chemistry either, their performances stand alone as emotional, funny and smart.  I'd go as far as to call Pfeiffer's Oscar worthy.The style and direction in the film is also notable.  There are split-screen conversations, some long steadicam shots, the whole placing of the camera fits perfectly with the light-hearted nature of the film.A fun, witty, lovable family film, 7.5/10.

This movie, on the other hand, may be trying to capture that old-fashioned feeling, but the values it's after are the values of craftsmanship and intelligence, two things rarely seen in comedies these days.  Oh, yes, and chemistry; Clooney and Pfeiffer have it in spades here.  The fact that it's set among the world of working parents and, for the most part, tries to get the details right, also helps.  And, oh yeah, it's funny.  It is a little cloying at times, and the end feels abrupt, but overall this is a pleasing movie.

It's all very much the same, ultra sweet and incredibly predictable. One Fine Day does confirm this, however it isn't as bad as most of the movies in the genre. It's actually a quite enjoyable and funny film. Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney did a very good job playing two people who are divorced, with a child, afraid to commit to someone else and with a hectic life. One day, they accidentally meet at the school where their kids go to school and during the day they keep meeting, however they hate each other and don't want to see the other ever again. But as the movie progresses, the relationship between the two changes from hating each other, to liking, to ... (this is a romantic comedy, I don't have to explain everything I hope).Even though some parts aren't excellent, the entire movie is actually quite good and enjoyable. It shows a lot of stereotypes of course like the ex-husband who doesn't want to help his ex-wife when she drowns in all the work and who needs him to take care of the kid, the man who still seems to act like a little child... But when you can see past that, it's an excellent movie to watch together with your wife or girlfriend. You'll both enjoy it. I give it a 7/10.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.No scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'The humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.To produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.The only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.Just occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams.

It follows an old formula that has worked so many times and that is still working  2 people who can't stand each other at first happen to spend some time together and eventually find each other attractive.  This requires 2 main things 1.) Two great actors with wonderful chemistry 2.) An original and funny script We have seen this in so many movies like 6 Days 7 Nights with Anne Heche and Harrison Ford or You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan or recently in The Runaway Bride with Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. I loved all these movies for they simply worked to charme me. One Fine Day fits perfectly to this list. George Clooney ( who proves that he can be a very funny guy) and Michelle Pfeiffer ( who gives a great performance in this movie) have very good chemistry and the script is very funny and romantic with some really great one-liners. This movie entertained me very much and it wasn't boring as I saw it the second time. For it's charme and fun, I give this movie 9/10.

But the basics are always basic. Two people meet and fall in love in a big city, and they have a miserable time doing so. They don't realize they like each other until the end where they embrace in a passionate kiss. If that doesn't sound too fun to you, there's the comedic side to the film. The two leads are played by Michelle Pfieiffer and George Clooney, who seems to be filling in Mel Gibson's shoes in an otherwise well-suited role. Clooney plays Jack Taylor, a divorced newspaper reporter for the New York Daily News. Pfieffer plays Melanie Parker, a busy working mom whose job has something to do with architecture.Both parents have kids. As always, there is a boy and girl, and the male (Clooney) has a daughter, Maggie (Mae Whitman), and the female (Pfieffer), has, of course, a little boy, Sammy (Alex D. Linz). Is there a mathematical law in cinema that makes it mandatory for a member of a certain sex to have a child of the opposite sex?After missing their children's school trip, both parents are left taking care of the kids. Melanie has an important job interview at 200 p.m., so she makes a deal with Jack He watches both children until 300, and she'll watch them for the rest of the day (since he has to get a column for the newspaper written which supposedly takes an hour).Why do romantic films always make the leading man have a hard-pressing job, usually as a reporter, and the leading woman have an even harder-pressing job? We never fully grasp what Pfieffer's job really is, but we know it must be very important, otherwise she wouldn't need to be running around to job meetings all day (which, coincedentally, she never really seems to be at - she's always in a cab or walking along a busy street blabbering away on her little 1996 cell phone).One Fine Day's alternate title could have been Cell Phone Tag, because basically the two leads just walk around all day on their cell phones. Other hilarious segments include a child getting a marble stuck up his nose, the two parents constantly losing their kids, and other such humorous adventures.But the interaction between Pfieffer and Clooney seems real enough. They throw punch lines and verbal digs back and forth, and we suspect that any minute one of them will jump through the other end of the phone, slap each other, and then embrace passionately. We know they are going to get together, we sit and wait and sit and wait, just waiting, and the film drags on just about twenty minutes too long - and then they finally kiss as the kids watch The Wizard of Oz in a nearby bedroom, and then she goes to freshen up, and when she comes back he is asleep on the sofa, and so she falls asleep next to him, and then we pull up towards the night view of a backlit New York City with the image of two children watching their parents asleep on a sofa, giggling and laughing. The first thing I thought/pondered is Those kids look up to no good, they're probably going to take their parents' credit cards and order gallons of ice cream and stay up all night watching R-rated movies. I guess I'm naughty.3/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Charming, throwaway romantic comedy..","Date":"17 March 2002","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  A charming if forgettable romantic comedy aided immeasurably by two attractive leads.

It's supposed to be a sweet romantic comedy with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer but the film just falls short. They're both single parents in New York City and they are having the worst day or the best day. The film's writing is weak and the actors don't do anything for me. The film is really bad in my opinion and I can't stand George Clooney at all as obnoxious jerk of a Daily News reporter, Jack Taylor. Michelle Pfeiffer does better as an architect, single mother. The supporting cast is excellent except they're just acting their parts. The film is a lame attempt to talk about single parenting in the city. The supporting cast has Holland Taylor as Melanie's mother just like her role as Evelyn on television. Ellen Greene is barely recognizable as Elaine Lieberman but does a nice job. Charles Durning is wonderful as always as Jack's boss. Sheila Kelley plays Jack's ex. Pete Hamill, a well known New York City reporter, plays a New York City reporter by a different name.

It is a great watch with the loved one cuddled in a recliner with a supply of coffee on a pleasant Sunday afternoon.

However, on first viewing I couldn't stop looking at my watch. The high point of the movie was Robert Klein's cameo as a psychologist, to whom Jack confides his feelings about Melanie.  In front of a 6-year old, they use the funniest barrage of word substitutions since the scene from Mel Brooks' High Anxiety where a youngster sits amidst a convention of psychiatrists discussing Freud's theory of peepee envy!But now, as a recent George Clooney convert, I admittedly re-watched this movie through rose-colored glasses. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are convincing as frazzled single parents, despite the fact that neither of them were actually parents, off-screen. They also break two cardinal rules of acting never share a scene with children or animals. But they manage to do both well, without losing audience attention, or treating the kids as wooden stage props.Clooney wears his paternal role with a generous dose of charm and humor ... and a thin layer of dark chocolate! Contrast this with his portrayal of a bank-robbing vampire slayer in From Dusk Til Dawn, and you'll realize the range of his craft! Pfeiffer is as beautiful an actress as they get, but that asset is underplayed in this movie, as in most of her movies. They make a good screen couple; Their battle-of-the-sexes banter is perfect and on-target. There are just enough sparks between them to anticipate the denoument, which is sweet and satisfactory.There is a lot of New York in this movie Central Park, mid-Manhattan, the Circle Line, the Museum of Natural History.

George Clooney has the unique looks to play both normal man like Jack Taylor in this film and others like Daniel Ocean in Ocean's Eleven, Ulysses McGill Everett (O, Brother, Where Art Thou?), Billy Tyne (The Perfect Stor), Thomas Devoe (The Peacemaker) and so on. It's a great enjoyment to see these two talented actors star together in this story which gives just the wonderful description to the busy lives of modern people in big cities.This is not a love story to me, but a story of modern busyness and love between parents and chidlren. Nowadays, people're busy with works and big events, and neglect the importance of spending time with their children, or can't be perfect at both. This film interpert the truth in a funny and warm way. It not just point out what modern people are really like, but all the potential problems (like in this film, a cellular phone mix-up, cat-eaten classroom fish, a crushed architectural model, a marble that has to be surgically removed from a small nostril, a lost child and various other crises). But even though all these catastrophes which may end up both Melanie and Jack's careers all add up in this hectic day, they finally go through all of them and it turned out to be one fine day.I have three favorite films of all times, this is one of them.

This is pretty close to it. As a romcom based in the Big Apple there has to be pace, sharp dialogue and wit (not least from the director, Michael Hoffman). We get all of this although one has the feeling that everyone got together beforehand and told each other 'this film's got to have pace, sharp dialogue, wit...'Jack (Clooney)'s ex-wife is exactly the same as Melanie (Pfeiffer). Caught on a day when she's up against it though she let's her tongue of the leash and this grips Jack's wilfully boyish imagination. This seems like a particularly cunning stroke one behalf of the writing team, who must be aware of Clooney's huge appeal across a broad range of women and, realising that inclusion is better business than alienating any one group, make it clear that even the generically rejected aren't terminally out of the running. The rest of the film is a version of The Parent Trap in which the couple's sparky children involuntarily contrive to bring the adults together.So far, two acts down and so good but then the film switches off. It's a great shame that no-one could find something more stimulating or intelligent to close the movie out. Still the stars know that they're the draw of the project and give good, if perfunctory happy ending. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Where is special edition DVD ??","Date":"10 July 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" It's been 11 years, but until now no special edition DVD release for this movie ??

The beauty of One Fine Day is that it's basically a platonic love story. There is technically no romantic relationship between the characters as they have just met for the first time in the beginning of the story and as the title suggests, the movie only takes us through their first day of having known each other, and this is a very intelligent film for knowing that the early stages are really the most exciting part of romance.	Our platonic couple in this story are a single mom architect named Melanie and a single dad journalist dad named Jack who are tied together in this story more out of necessity than anything else. For one thing, their kids missed the bus for the day's field trip and this also, coincidentally is a very important day with their jobs, so they need to pool their resources together in order to keep their kids out of trouble and their jobs respectively.         We get to sort of watch a simulated relationship here, as the way these two must attend to each other's needs, even in a forced situation like this, parallels the way two people in a relationship would do so. Some of the inadvertent events in the story, a rivalry that develops between Melanie and an admirer of Jack, or a brief meeting between Jack and Melanie's mom, help add to this effect. In terms of their needs, the two have such unforgiving bosses and they catch so few breaks, with all their relatives bailing out, that they become very needy. The intelligence again comes from the fact that with Michelle Pfieffer and George Clooney there, the two protagonists are both very strong and capable characters. In fact, we come to sympathize with them over the outside factors that deny them an easy solution for their problems to the point where they become antiheroes. Clooney and Pfieffer's younger counterparts, Mae Whittman and Alex Lunz as the two kids, pull off the two big requirements of their role being loveable and cute but at the same time highly annoying as one likes to stick things up his nose and the other one likes to wander off.The script ties up story like clockwork in a fun lightweight film done beautifully.

Clooney can no doubt provide the easy charm needed here effortlessly, and Michelle Pffiefer (sp?) is and always has been watchable and beautiful at the same time.   No real sparks fly between the two stars, but this is a film that sneaks up and tries to woo you slowly, rather than attempting to get you into bed on the first date.  It has buckets of natural charm that help you to waive any grievances over plot contrivances or lack of uncontrollable passion.  Only the hardest of hearts will remain unmoved after this cinematic breeze of a film.   This will never become a classic; it's far too 'nice' and predictable for that.

Linz in particular jams marbles up his nose. It regards balance and taking time to appreciate the important things.

He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off.Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule.Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him.It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children.The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development.The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

Tastefully directed by Michael Hoffman (Restoration, This is my Life and the much anticipated A Midsummer Night's Dream). The writing is good. This love hate relationship is very common on the American cinema. I do not know if that works in reality. But this is a love portrait in the movies! The dialogue is witty.Michelle Pfeiffer (Up Close and Personal, Frankie and Johnny (1991)) plays an architect who is a single parent. She is very vivacious in this part. There is a chemistry between her and George Clooney (ER, Batman & Robin (1997), The Thin Red Line). I thought that Clooney was good for the part because we watch ER all the time and he was very believable as Jack Taylor. I liked Jack Taylor more than I did Melanie Parker, their characters.The kids are adorable. Mae Whitman already played in Hope Floats another Obst production. Alex D. Linz ( Home Alone 3) Sammy,  is now a mega star in the kid's movies. They are both adorable! Obst seems to like those plots where the mom has the dilemma between kids and their careers. Nothing wrong with that since this is a very common thing in our society where most women do have to work full time and juggle all that. And yes, many are divorced. That is a reflection of our society.My favorite scenes  kids talking are always funny, Parker's  mother in the SPA when they switched cell phones, the Hispanic maid (too much of stereotypes, but still funny) who cannot understand English in an emergency then arguing which boat to take, Jack Taylor picking up Melanie Parker and carrying her when the ground is wet, and the kids match making. The psychiatric scene the fish, and the girl picked up every line. This is a cool movie.  It is fun and I recommend it.

During the course of the day hostility turns to dislike and to distain and eventually to flirtatious interest.A mobile phone fairy tale &#150; that's what this is.  The two characters spend a lot of time apart and make the scenes with the two together even more important.  The story is not great but it's all done with a certain amount of charm and energy that carries it.  It's also nice to see a romance that involves single parents as real people (well&#133;sort of real!).  The story tries to create sub-plots relating to Melanie and Jack's jobs so that they have something to do, but it's really not fully used.  Instead we have charm and light comedy.  It's not rocket science but it makes for a warm romantic comedy.Clooney is excellent &#150; OK, he's only doing his bent-neck-concerned-tone act that he did in ER, but he does it well.  He is the driving force behind all the charm and most of the comedy.  Pfeiffer is saddled with a bossy, stressed character who's comedy is most pratfalls and clumsiness.  I'm surprised that she didn't want more as she was also an exec-producer on this.  The support cast is good but some faces including Charles Durning and Michael Massee (who has risen to cult figure for his role as Gaines in the excellent series 24).Overall the film is very light and fluffy.

Basically, in New York City, Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an architect and single mother to son Sammy (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz), Jack Taylor (George Clooney) is a New York Daily News columnist and single father to daughter Maggie (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), both of them are divorced. One fine day the two parents meet each other, morning time, and when both the children are late for the field trips they were meant to go, they are forced to join the parents during their hectic schedules, and make sure that they are cared for with their needs as well. Melanie must show an important client her architectural design presentation, and Sammy is causing havoc when he causes her to break her scale model, and in frustration she takes him to a daycare centre, holding a Superhero Day. Jack is trying to get a scoop from Mayor Sidney Aikens (Sidney Armus) about his connections with the mob, and he is bringing Maggie to the daycare centre as well, and they have improvised superhero costumes made. Melanie is on her way to a meeting she gets a worrying phone call from her son about something to do with drugs, and in desperation she asks Jack, who she has the number of now, to get the kids, and he agrees as long as she has them at a time. Melanie breaks down while with the kids she loses Maggie, and she is forced to report the child missing, but thankfully she is found, and Jack is informed of this occurrence, but he makes it to the press conference to confront the Mayor and get his scoop. Sammy is looking forward to a soccer game that his father will hopefully be at, his mother insists she will have time to pitch her architecture idea to the clients at a restaurant, but she sacrifices it during, at risk of getting fired, for the sake of her child. The clients were actually impressed with her dedication to her child, and Sammy and Maggie make it to the soccer game, with Sammy's father indeed showing up, but not for long, as he is drumming for Bruce Springsteen. That evening Jack needs an excuse to go and see Melanie at her apartment, so he gets Maggie to buy a new goldfish to replace their other one that was eaten by the cat. While the children watch The Wizard of Oz together, Jack and Melanie seem to get on much better than they were in their hectic day, where they squabbled and were rushed, but they share a kiss, before falling asleep together on the sofa. Also starring The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Lew, Jon Robin Baitz as Yates Jr., Ellen Greene as Elaine Lieberman, Joe Grifasi as Manny Feldstein, Pete Hamill as Frank Burroughs and Anna Maria Horsford as Evelyn. Pfeiffer makes a convincing single mother who is forced into having to look after her often bratty child, Clooney is likable as the single father who ha a similar situation with his sweet daughter, Whitman is nice as the little girl, and I agree that Linz is a little less cute with his needy nature. For this theme of film, this actually works not just for the reasonable laughs and alright enough love story, but it is also a convincing portrait of the life of single parents, I will admit it could have had a more layered script, but it is an interesting enough romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for For The First Time (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!

Even in a comedy, where we probably allow a greater proportion of liberties to be taken, that basic conjuring trick still needs to be performed. For us to be emotionally involved and to care about the characters we're watching, we need to BELIEVE that what we see on screen could actually happen, and in a romantic comedy that could not be more important. For me, that's where this film failed. The plot-driven script raced along at such a frenetic, breathless pace, it seemed as if half the dialogue took place on each other's mobile phone.  The writers determination to get to the objective regarding Clooney and Pfeiffer's relationship as quickly as possible, which they had to ( because as it says on the tin, it all took place on, 'One Fine Day') meant there wasn't a great deal of credibility regarding their respective character development.  The script didn't allow for the characters to enjoy the scenery.  Did they really do enough to make one another to fall in love so completely, in just a few hours, with so few real encounters between them?  Was it really possible for Pfeiffer especially to turn around so quickly, from her entrenched position, when she had been so adamant she definitely did not require anyone else in her life? We have to remember that on this particular 'Fine Day' it also happened to be an extremely stressful day, full of distractions that were so engaging, both could of easily lost their jobs. Clooney's character was threatening to bring down the mayor, and his newspaper was under extreme pressure to find new witnesses to support their claims of corruption because the original witness' testimony had been withdrawn, and Pfeiffer's character had to submit an important design for one of her company's most important clients. Yet, amidst all this commotion and anxiety, they still fall in love - in one day. Hmmm...The thing that particularly cracked me up, was Pffeifer's mother. Here was a woman who clearly cared about her daughter and her daughter's welfare. Always on the look out for a suitable partner for her daughter-so much so, that as soon as she spots George Clooney in her salon she raves about his qualities and marks him out as the ideal candidate.  Why? Because that's what mothers do when they care about their children.  Yet, despite her very evident concern, she would not assist her daughter from losing her job by baby-sitting her son, because her beauty treatment in the salon was more important!  A slight contradiction, me thinks.That said, it was a harmless, inoffensive film, that contained some nice touches. The film started in the rain and ended in the rain. At the beginning the cameras panned across a block of flats highlighting different ones caught in the glare of the cameras spotlight. It did the same at the end. I do like my films to resolve! All the acting was good. George Clooney's laid back cool was endearing. Pfeiffer's acting was mostly about falling over, and looking harrassed, but in the last scene there's one moment (blink and you'll miss it)where she displays a degree of vulnerable insecurity, something I'm sure we've all experienced in similar situations, before thoughts and feelings are made known. For that moment alone I upgraded it from a 5 to a 6.Overall Rating 6 out of ten.
