[{"Title":"Did someone leave a cigarette burning?","Date":"2 February 2004","Score":"64 out of 77 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Having struck box office gold two years earlier with The Poseidon Adventure, Irwin Allen aided by the combined financing of Fox and Warner Bros., decided to do himself one better with The Towering Inferno.  No expense was spared, as evidenced by Allen securing the services of two of the top box office draws available in Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Next, he hedged his bet with a supporting cast that ran the gamut from William Holden, Fred Astaire and Faye Dunaway to soap actress Susan Flannery and football star O.J. Simpson.  Add a lot of fire, a lot of smoke, a lot of flaming and charred humans and you have the makings of a box office bonanza.  It's amazing that the budget was held down to a mere $14 million dollars even in 1974 dollars.  Did it work?  The film grossed $116 million dollars which was quite a princely sum in those days so the answer to that as far as Allen, Fox, and Warner Bros. is concerned would be yes.Newman plays architect Doug Roberts who has been away in the jungle somewhere but is returning home just in time for the grand opening of the tallest building ever to grace California that he just happened to have designed.  Doug is also returning home to his mistress played by Faye Dunaway to persuade her to join him on his next project.  The head of the company building the tower is James Duncan(William Holden) whom has left a lot of the details of the construction of the tower to his no good son-in-law, Roger Simmons(Richard Chamberlain).  That turns out to be bad news for everyone unfortunate to find themselves in The Tower.  After some of the wiring in the building begins to have a major meltdown, Doug investigates to find that Roger has cut so many corners it could lead to a major catastrophe.  Was there any doubt?Despite the abundance of headlining actors in Towering Inferno, the true star of the film is the disaster itself, just as it is in any of these concoctions.  Allen directed the action sequences with John Guillerman handling the rest of the chores.  Allen does himself proud.  Although we know of course that The Tower is not truly as tall as the filmmakers would have us believe, it's not obvious enough to detract from the film.  It doesn't matter though, as most of the action takes place inside the building or near the suite at the top where most of our stars end up trapped.  Of course this being a disaster film, we do get the privilege of watching flaming bodies fall over a hundred stories, be it it outside or down an elevator shaft.Allen also does well at piling on the suspense and keeps you on edge for long moments, with such things as a long climb up a flaming stare well and a long decent down a scenic elevator that will have you wringing your hands.  The fire sequences are all well staged as you can almost feel the flames leaping through the screen and smell the smoke circling around the room.The problem with most disaster films is that with the good, there is generally some bad and Inferno is no exception.  Some of the dialog in this film is truly horrendous.Example  Duncan How bad is it? Halloran It's a fire.  All fires are badJames Duncan Give me the architect that designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts? Susan I do.In one truly silly moment, after Dan Bigelow(Robert Wagner) and his secretary Lorrie (Susan Flannery)have just finished love making, the fire has engulfed the room next to theirs.  Lorrie, being the ever observant secretary and mistress sniffs and delivers this line Did someone leave a cigarette burning?The best of the actors is easily Steve McQueen.  As Chief Michael O'Hallorhan who is called to put the fire out, he seems to relish has role as a fire department head.  Paul Newman on the other hand is a mixed bag.  When he's playing his scenes with McQueen, Holden, Dunaway, or Chamberlain, he's OK.  In other scenes, especially when the fire initially breaks out, he appears stiff and uncomfortable.  Fred Astaire is on hand as the whimsical con artist Harlee Claiborne out to bilk Lisolette Mueller (Jennifer Jones)with some phony stocks.  Jones is one of the best things going in this movie, turning out to be quite the heroine.  Dunaway as Robert's girlfriend Susan is dry enough that we wish they could have brought Joanne Woodward in to give the relationship some real spark (no pun intended).  Wagner as Dan Bigelow is a charmer but we just can't buy into his relationship with Lorrie (Susan Flannery).  Susan Blakely as Patty Simmons, Holden's spoiled daughter and the wife of Roger (Richard Chamberlain)has nothing much to do except chastise her husband for causing Daddy a big headache.  Chamberlain, on the other hand, seems to like playing the role of the villain and he does it well.  You'll have no trouble believing just how big of a jerk Roger is.  Last , is O.J. Simpson as the security guard who seems to be smarter than everybody else.  The role requires little and in his big screen debut, Simpson gives it just that.No matter.  The Towering Inferno will still entertain you.  At 165 minutes, you'll only be looking at your watch in the first half hour or so as you wait for that one tiny spark to ignite a night of suspense.  Irwin Allen put quite a spectacle on the screen, but unfortunately never again duplicated it and with each subsequent film his product went from bad to being truly mediocre.  Considering how much I really liked this film, it's a shame.  Now, please put out that cigarette.My Grade B                    "},{"Title":"Still impressive","Date":"27 December 2003","Score":"51 out of 60 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  When I was an impressionable teenager in 1975 I saw Towering Inferno 4 times at the cinema, Still a record for me, and despite the years and jaded view of middle age, this is still a thrilling film, mainly because the effects are so realistic, no CGI then, and the characters are so presented well (if a bit archly at times).

However, somehow, The Towering Inferno holds its place near the top of my list of great films, and is at the top of my list of favorite films.While Irwin Allen's films often have many flaws, they're always entertaining. You won't feel cheated by an Irwin Allen film. This holds true especially for The Towering Inferno. There is something for almost everyone in this film, drama, romance, disaster, and good vs. evil are all present in this epic film.The plot of the film is pretty well known to anyone who has at least heard of the film. During opening night ceremonies at the Glass Tower, the 138 story skyscraper located in the heart of San Francisco catches fire. What starts as a small electrical fire soon turns into a night of blazing suspense, with fires breaking out all over the building.The hard work put into this film is obvious. While the script is rather melodramatic at times, this does not take away from the feeling of peril in the film. The cast may be the best cast ever assembled in Hollywood history. The special effects, for the most part, stand the test of time.Don't ask me why this film has gotten such a bad rep over the years. The film was nominated for best picture, and won Oscars for best cinematography, best special effects, and best song. The film grossed over 116 million dollars, and with adjusted totals, that is still more than films such as The Passion of the Christ, and Lord of the Rings The Two Towers.I recommend that this film be seen. It is well worth renting, or if you can find it, buying.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, special effects and elaborate stunt work can actually be the star of a movie and provide ample compensation for poor writing, clumsy direction and really amateurish acting. THE TOWERING INFERNO is, of course, a disaster movie, the methodical destruction of a high-rise skyscraper, along with many of its tenants. It came on the heels of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and quite honestly is no match for that film's delicious mix of sappy sentimentality and hammy heroics. But, while its dramatic quality is only marginally superior to hack films like AIRPORT '75 and the atrocious EARTHQUAKE, INFERNO provides a masterful blend of audience manipulation and technical craftsmanship. As Paul Newman pointed out to the press, neither he nor his perpetual professional rival Steve McQueen are the star of the film the fire is the star. And as appropriate to any star, the fire, in all of its glorious mayhem, is lovingly filmed and given a wide berth to overact with style.The rest of the cast should be so lucky. The remarkable, once-in-a-lifetime cast (Newman, McQueen, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Fred Astaire, etc.) behave like troopers, even though they are primarily reduced to being little more than high priced props. Most of the scenes involving actual human interaction seem rushed and the inept line readings of the inane dialogue suggest that no one bothered with retakes, let alone rehearsals. But such moments are little more than filler, marking time between some of the most remarkable actions sequences ever filmed. The helicopter rescue of the derailed scenic elevator is heartstoppingly thrilling, even as you realize that it is absolutely physically impossible. And it is overshadowed by the explosive final showdown with the villainous fire. Hollywood has cinematically destroyed greater amounts of real estate, but seldom with such style.As art, THE TOWERING INFERNO is a fizzle, but as a cheap carnival thrill show it's pretty hot stuff.

It was really nice to see her again.What really surprised me about this film when I watched it earlier this year was that the special effects were still good, and the film is almost 40 years old. It was also good to see Steve McQueen being the good guy again. He was the best character in the film. The worst was William Holden, who turned out to play a lot profane-spewing nasty people as soon as the Hays' code was totally abolished in 1967. Same thing for Paul Newman. McQueen, meanwhile, kept his class as did Jones, of course, and Astaire.The film is almost three hours long but, a few soap opera scenes aside, it's a solid adventure story that holds up well and it served a good purpose, making hotel owners more aware of potential fire hazards.

The ever competitive McQueen made his film debut with a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me in which Newman starred, and one of his ambitions was to finally get top billing over his number one rival. Even with the so-called diagonal billing employed in the film and its advertising (with Newman's name elevated slightly above McQueen's), those of us who read from left to right can see that McQueen got his wish. He also got the best role. He's the firefighter, a tight jawed man of action, while Newman is saddled with the less sympathetic role of the architect. But the real star is the burning building. It burns, and impressively at that, but there's something very claustrophobic about this situation which results in less action than Allen's previous smash, The Posiedon Adventure. But the acting is better. In addition to McQueen and Newman, the cast includes Richard Chamberlain (particularly good), William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Fred Astaire. That's an improvement over Carol Lynley and Eric Shea, both of whom Gene Hackman had the misfortune of emoting with two years earlier. Whatever one thinks of this particular genre, The Towering Inferno is probably the best of the bunch.

The building that William Holden built, that Paul Newman designed was also on its maiden voyage so to speak. The 135 story building in San Francisco was being dedicated and there was going to be a big blowout on the top floor with all kinds of VIPS in attendance. Little does Holden suspect that his son-in-law Richard Chamberlain cut quite a few safety corners in the electrical wiring. When the whole tower gets lighted up, a fire breaks out in one of the circuit junction boxes and the party gets cut short.Paul Newman and Steve McQueen as the fire battalion chief head an impressive cast list of name players put in harm's way by Chamberlain's avarice. Fred Astaire got an Academy Award nomination for playing an elderly conman who tricks his way into the VIP gathering to fleece wealthy widow Jennifer Jones. This was Jones's farewell performance on screen, she retired right after that to become just the kind of wealthy society matron she plays here.The film got an award for Best Cinematography deservedly so, the shots are quite vivid and also the best song of 1974. During the party scene, Maureen McGovern who had introduced the popular There's Got To Be A Morning After in Irwin Allen's The Poseidon Adventure sings We May Never Get To Love Like This Again. It won for best song, but certainly didn't have the lasting popularity of the other.The most vivid moment of the film for me besides the climax is the illfated rendezvous of Robert Wagner and Susan Flannery. They agree for a boss secretary rendezvous in his apartment there and Wagner turns off the phone so word cannot reach them of the fire. The death scenes of both will tear you up.According to the Films of Steve McQueen the reason for the joint production by Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox is that when two studios put out two Harlow films, both cut each other up at the box office and no one made out. Warner Brothers purchased The Tower and Fox bought the Glass Inferno screen rights. Rather than have competing disaster films, they made an historic interstudio agreement to have a joint production.I think it worked out well all around.

Enter producer Irwin Allen who smartly suggested that both studios should come together and produce one blockbusting genre defining film. Splitting the cost down the middle, The Towering Inferno was born and went on to make over $100 million across the globe, a very impressive take for its time, and certainly a shot in the arm for disaster genre enthusiasts.The Towering Inferno is far from flawless, it contains some cheese sodden dialogue, and the film's running time doesn't quite do the film any favours. However, the film's strengths far outweigh the handful of negatives that are often used to beat it up with. The sets are fabulous (Academy Award Nominated) and all to perish in the fire, the cinematography from Fred J Koenekamp (Academy Award Winner) is lush and puts the fire in the eyes, while the score from John Williams (Academy Award Nominated) is suitably poignant and edgy. What about the action sequences? The set pieces? With many of the illustrious cast doing their own stunts! All impacting sharp on the ears thanks to the brilliant sound from Soderberg & Lewis (Academy Award Nominated), with the cast itself a reminder of a wonderful time when only the big names were considered for the big projects, McQueen, Newman, Holden, Astaire (Academy Award Nominated) & Dunaway rolling off the tongue like a who's who of entertainment heavyweights.Some say that The Towering Inferno finally killed off the ailing disaster genre, no it didn't, it crowned it, and all the others that followed were merely trailing in its wake. The Towering Inferno is a spectacular production that positively booms with high entertainment values, no expense is spared in the pursuit of entertaining the masses, it's thoughtful in texture and it teaches as it plays and it remains to me a wonderful archaic gem. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Classic star-studded disaster film....","Date":"20 July 2003","Score":"16 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  With the likes of INDEPENDENCE DAY and DIE HARD, which were both influenced by THE TOWERING INFERNO, a new awareness of the potential of the disaster film emerged, culminating in the likes of DEEP IMPACT, ARMAGEDDON and the more recent THE CORE.The definition of 'all-star cast' and 'star-studded' has changed substantially in the last few years and in fact, the true star of THE TOWERING INFERNO wasn't any actor or star, but the late Irwin Allen, whose career in this type of film ended with the poorly-received WHEN TIME RAN OUT.The film, which was adapted from two source novels, THE GLASS INFERNO and THE TOWER (both of which were bought by rival studios Fox and Warner to compete at the box-office - and then decided at the last minute to pool their resources into creating a single script) is impressive in scope and design.For the uninitiated, one of the books deals with a disgrunted ex-employee who decides to cause an accident which starts a fire and in some ways that would have made a more intriguing storyline, but the plot of the actual film which involves cost-cutting to electrical circuits which causes the fire int the first place works as it is.At a running time of 158 minutes some may think the film too long. In this day and age there would have possibly been test screenings and some cutting of the film, but since the success of TITANIC at the box-office longer films have become the norm. Indeed, the more recent HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS movies are in this bracket (although the upcoming KILL BILL story that the three-hour film will be split in two may pave the way for shorter lengths!!) Mind you, THE GREAT ESCAPE is of similar length and that film moves at a cracking pace.Steve McQueen is on screen less than some of the other stars in the film, but his performance is the best and complements others on show.

There are still flaws in the building and naturally a small spark in a utility room will lead to an overwhelming night of terror and heroism.

However it is Fred Astaire (in an Oscar-nominated role of a lifetime) and then-Buffalo Bill superstar O.J. Simpson (showing the style, grace and power that he showed on the playing field here in his debut screen performance) that stand out and create a higher dimension to an honestly corn-filled story. A terribly difficult production to pull off due to the very large scope involved. The technical effects compete well with the all-world performers to make a stunningly impressive movie.

It was well-made, well-acted, and well-sold on the box-office. The problem, though, was it was too long. The first parts revolved on the celebration of the grand opening of the tallest office building on earth (at the movies, of course), the Glass Tower. But when it gets to the disaster, you see how great this film is. Impressive special-effects and great acting by an all-star cast help make this film the classic it is.

Indeed, the structure which caught fire in this film was actually created from two stories. The original building was called 'The Tower' and it's sister structure was called  The Glass Inferno.' Together they were united summarily and christened as  The Towering Inferno.  Assembling a memorable cast caused this movie to be riveting and spellbinding. The inner tale for this combined feature is of a majestic and towering high rise which has just been inaugurated as it's first occupants are checking in and occupying their rooms. The architect, Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) has just returned from a short vacation and is impressed with his completed design. Immediately upon his return however, he discovers a small fire has broken out, due to faulty wiring. As the fire spreads, the Construction engineer, Jim Duncan (William Holden) is informed his chief electrical engineer has just been burned to death. As the fires continues to grow and evolve into a flaming, dangerous and ever rising inferno, the city's fire departments begin to arrive introducing Chief Michael O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen). Several other stories thread and interlace the surface story involving Hollywood's elite, including Fred Astaire, Faye Dunaway, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Vaughn, and Robert Wagner. If you're seeing this movie for the first time, be prepared for many action scenes and exciting hair raising stunts. The story line is plausible (due to 911) as we acknowledge the firmly established courage and honored reputation of America's valiant Firemen, which is now fact and part of our history.

It's also the blueprint for Die Hard, which borrows many of its key setpieces almost verbatim &#150; the trapped party guests, the hero crawling around at the top of a seemingly endless lift shaft, the chopper exploding on the roof, the explosion that unleashes a deluge on the building &#150; while scaling down the all-star cast and adding gunplay to the mix. As a rule in the genre, movie stars survive, TV stars die, but it's not ironclad here, although the probability of death does seem directly correlated to the amount of screen time a character gets. It's a lavishly mounted affair and, unlike the Glass Tower itself, beautifully constructed. Stirling Silliphant's script sets up the characters (although some, like Robert Vaughn, end up sidelined completely for most of the film) and the premise so efficiently that you barely notice it's 36 minutes before anyone even notices the fire, while the survival (or otherwise) set pieces are well-staged and show some imagination &#150; particularly the scenic elevator scene.If with recent history it may seem a tad tasteless to say it, the film is Hollywood enough to enjoy as an old-fashioned survival story/disaster movie and at least doesn't dodge the bullet of the main characters' complicity in the corner-cutting that results in the disaster &#150; even Newman's supposedly idealistic architect takes the blame for his inaction in preventing it.

These Irwin Allen movies culminated here before diminishing with the dreadful 'The Swarm.' Films are reflections of their cultures, it seems so alien now. Remember what was going on here in the USA? Watergate and the humiliating withdrawal from Vietnam on the horizon. Allen's film may seem morally random but not really. The most horrific deaths are the unfaithful husband Robert Wagner playing around after hours with his secretary. It is not a coincidence that these are the most graphic burning deaths in the film. Remember Stella Stevens' death right before they escape in The Poseidon Adventure? Same thing, she was a reformed prostitute who had married Earnest Borgnine the cop. Allen sanctions moral violations with death here; Chamberlain, the slimy electrician, who cut corners on the buildings wiring also has the next worst death. Yes, young people, we have children and pets being rescued by O.J. Simpson, but for its length it moves just as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The main reason to watch this is for the performances of a one in a lifetime cast. Holden does very well here as the rich guy trying to find out why his building is on fire. I concur with the main attack upon the movie, even way back here, that the weight of the amount of water necessary to extinguish the fire, without collapsing the floors below it, will make you chuckle, try not to notice. There are some informative tidbits also like why you don't use an elevator during a fire; as in Backdraft, why you test the doors before opening them. The lead up to the fire is much shorter, despite its length, than the buildup to the tsunami in Poseidon. When you watch it over, watch for how the instability in America, at this time, has been reified into the fire. The fire here behaves almost supernaturally creeping and jumping without warning. The key to grasping this film genre is the core within each film, the supposedly safe environment turns upon the people. This simile is salient if you recall what was going on in America outside the theaters when this was playing Watergate and Vietnam. The effects with the exception of the outside of the building itself are well done. The rescue with the fireman's chair on a wire between buildings, forty years later, remains very suspenseful and creepy. On the big screen, this and McQueen riding the glass elevator dangling from a helicopter were the highlights of the movie. There is much less exposition of the personal stories of the characters than in Poseidon. This film was a reaction to the critical attacks upon the 'floating soap opera' as Poseidon was derisively called at the time. Here, the stories of the characters are all directly relevant to what went wrong with the building. The exception is the doomed lady who feels sorry for Astaire, the stock swindler, and is dropped by Allen from the glass elevator in moral reprisal. Like Hitch, there are moral punishments for the victims and how horrifically their deaths are depicted. It seems random but watch it over and you will see how Allen apes Hitch and DePalma. For me, this was the crown jewel of Irwin Allen. Posideon was a good movie but this cast is rivaled only by The Sting. Films are like slices of time now ossified forever; this can seem so bizarre to the young people watching this today. Yet, in the United States, the streets were filled with angry protesters against the war with Watergate growing in strength daily.

No wonder the subplots of this, also Poseidon Adventure, worked so well, the screenplay is written by the same person who wrote In the Heat of the Night, Stirling Silliphant. John Williams score was fantastic, and it was before he became a household name with Jaws and Star Wars. Two things that made me appreciated the film even more now are 1) the careful use of color, which got Fred J. Koenekamp and Joseph F. Biroc the Cinematography Oscar, and 2) the handling of all the egos of the superstars, particularly the two leads Steve McQueen & Paul Newman.

There I was, a young kid, sitting in my parents house on a cold bleak Saturday morning in Michigan. We had HBO back then so I turned on the cable box hoping to find something fun to watch (possible cartoons). As I was channel surfing, I came across a classic 70's disaster flick that remains to this day, one of my all time favorite films. The Towering Inferno is a tense, exciting, and flat out entertaining piece of cinema. It has popcorn flick written all over it. At 165 minutes, its got a long running time, but it doesn't feel that way. Inferno moves by at an unbelievably fast clip and its got a huge cast of stars who look as if they all had a lot of fun making it. Its also got special effects that even today would hold up against any lifeless Michael Bay production.Inferno came out during a wave of other disaster flicks like Earthquake (1974), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), and Airport (1970). Safe to say it's the best one of the bunch. It's truly one of the reasons I love watching movies as well as reviewing them.It tells the story of the world's tallest building (The Glass Tower) in San Francisco having an electrical short that starts a huge fire (81st floor). The fire quickly spreads threatening to kill everybody on the top floor (they're having a dedication ceremony/party for the opening of the tower). With the help of a determined architect (Doug Roberts played by Paul Newman) and a fire department led by Chief Michael O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen ), enormous efforts are made to try and stop the out of control blaze using any means necessary.The concept for The Towering Inferno was based on two novels, The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. And although the film is minimal on plot, it makes up with for it with relentless action and suspense. They didn't have PG-13 movies back then and this film really pushed the envelope for PG fare. Yes, there are death by fire scenes in the film that really shook me upon first viewing. But as I got older and viewed Inferno many times over, I realized that this was an important element in keeping the viewer clinging to the screen, helplessly wanted to know if the rest of the cast makes it out alive.Lets talk about that cast. We have William Holden as James Duncan (the builder), we got Fred Astaire as Harlee Claiborne (Astaire was nominated for best supporting actor by the Academy), we got Richard Chamberlain as Roger Simmons (the electrical engineer), and lets not forget former NFL running back O.J. Simpson as Harry Jernigan (Chief Security Officer). With his huge 70's afro and confident demeanor, he pioneered the whole athletes transitioning to acting thing. He gives a solid performance, unlike the forgettable ones he gave in the Naked Gun movies.All in all, The Towering Inferno is a bonified masterpiece. I normally don't say that a lot of films because I have been critical in the past with movies of this genre. Edited splendidly by Harold Kress and Carl Kress and directed with gusto by John Guillermin and Irwin Allen, Inferno has the real feel of a true Best Picture Nominee (it was in fact nominated at the 1975 academy awards). It also kind of serves secretly as a public announcement about the dangers of fire and fire prevention.Inferno is dangerous, epic, exhausting stuff and when it does move closer and closer to its conclusion, we get the pleasure of seeing two renegades (Newman and McQueen) come together to stop an out of control fire destroying everything in its path. I've gotta admit seeing these two Hollywood legends on screen gives me goosebumps. Oh heck, the whole film gives me goosebumps. If you love movies and want to escape, Inferno is pretty serviceable. Just get a big bucket of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the ride.

Perhaps even more disconcerting, however, is the discovery that the construction of the World Trade Towers actually prompted the two novels upon which THE TOWERING INFERNO was based THE TOWER by Richard Martin Stern and THE GLASS INFERNO by Thomas M. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson, both of which concerned out-of-control fires in skyscrapers.When the 1972 success of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE gave producer Irwin Allen the title Master of Disaster, Allen set out to live up to it and moved to acquire the rights to THE TOWER. 20th Century Fox was outbid by Warner Brothers--but Allen saw a way to turn a big project into a bigger one and encouraged Fox to snap up the rights to the Scortia and Robinson novel. Allen then managed to negotiate a deal that found Fox and Warner combining forces on a single film THE TOWERING INFERNO. As written by Stirling Slilliphant, the story concerned the world's tallest building on its grand opening--when shoddy constructions causes a fire that traps hundreds of people above the eighty-first floor.In a general sort of way, INFERNO might have been called POSEIDON REDUX, for while the specifics were quite different the concept was essentially the same an all-star cast trapped by a disaster and forced to fight for their lives. And the cast is amazing; not only did Allen succeed in getting Steve McQueen and Paul Newman to co-star, he signed Faye Dunaway to play Newman's love interest and cast Fred Astaire against type as a con-man. Even more astonishingly, he lured reclusive and legendary film star Jennifer Jones out of retirement for the sympathetic role of Lisolette Mueller. Other notables include William Holden, Richard Chamberlin, Robert Wagner, Susan Blakely, Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Robert Vaughn, and a pre-scandal O.J. Simpson.But POSEIDON and INFERNO differ in two very significant ways. POSEIDON focuses on the struggles of ten people who acted as a single unit throughout the film; INFERNO casts a wider net with multiple story lines, and the result is considerably looser in terms of plot and action. With the exception of long shots of the ship, POSEIDON did not use miniatures--and indeed every set and effect was real time; the sets were real, the water was real, the fire was real, and the cast (which did most of the stunts) was very much in the middle of it. The fire and the heights involved in INFERNO, however, were too dangerous for such, and consequently INFERNO makes considerable use of miniatures, various process shots (matte paintings and rear projection), and stunt people. Some of this has not dated well at all.With its loose structure, the occasional dated effect, and a running time of almost three hours, THE TOWERING INFERNO is sometimes less tense than simply wearing--but only occasionally, and even with these defects it remains a visually fascinating display of pre-CGI state of the art in special effects. At its best, it is an extremely exciting film, and certainly 1974 audiences found it so; it would play in theatrical release for close to a full year, becoming one of the biggest box office hits of the decade.The current Special Edition DVD release is quite fine, including a host of extras that range from a nicely done AMC Backstory documentary to an interview with Irwin Allen himself; the various commentary tracks (one of the scene specific re effects and stunt work) are also well done, although I did think it a pity that none of the surviving cast could be lured into commentaries of their own. The picture quality is excellent and the sound quality quite good. People will probably always argue about which is better THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE or THE TOWERING INFERNO. My money is on POSEIDON, but there's no denying that INFERNO, even with its occasional flaws, is right up there in the genre. Recommended for disaster film junkies without hesitation! GFT, Amazon Reviewer "},{"Title":"The Fire is the Star","Date":"1 September 2006","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The seventies were the golden age of the disaster movie. The main reason was probably that the art of the special effect had by now evolved far enough to make this type of film credible. Earlier attempts to make disaster movies, such as In Old Chicago made in 1937 about the Chicago fire of 1871, or even A Night to Remember made more than two decades later about the sinking of the Titanic, tend to put me in mind of Samuel Johnson's famous dictum about a dog walking on its hind legs; it is not done well, but one is surprised to see it done at all. Certainly, the large-screen spectacle which these films provided would have given film-makers a welcome weapon in their continuing fight with the TV companies.The world's tallest skyscraper has just been completed in San Francisco. A reception to mark the occasion is being held on the top floor by James Duncan, the developer responsible for the project, and all the great and the good of the city have been invited. A fire breaks out on the eighty-first floor, trapping the guests. The city's fire brigade have to battle to save them. Will they manage to rescue them or extinguish the flames in time? In order to provide some human interest, there are a number of subplots. There is a couple having an extra-marital affair (predictably, given the moralistic tone of many disaster movies, they are among the first victims of the fire). A con-man is romancing a middle-aged lady with a view to selling her shares in non-existent companies. The most important subplot concerns Roger Simmons, Duncan's son-in-law and the main villain. Simmons was one of the sub-contractors working on the project and, in order to cut costs, furnished the building with sub-standard electrical wiring well below the architect's specifications. Inevitably, it is this wiring which is responsible for the fire, and equally inevitably Simmons, who is one of those trapped, proves himself to be not only a shady businessman but also a selfish coward.The film was based upon two separate novels, and it was presumably the need to combine people and incidents from both books that led to both the large cast of characters and the lengthy running time of nearly three hours. Although there are really only two major roles- fire chief Mike O'Hallorhan and architect Doug Roberts- the film features a remarkably large number of A-list stars, many of them playing relatively minor parts that in most films would have gone to character actors.The film-makers obviously felt that hiring so many big names would act as a box-office draw, but in terms of quality this strategy was not altogether successful. As another reviewer has pointed out, the real star of this film is the fire itself. All the human interest subplots pale into insignificance; when Jennifer Jones, who has hitherto played a relatively important part as the intended victim of the con-man's scheme and as a heroine who has protected two young children, falls to her death, we hardly notice. (A rather downbeat ending to Jones's film career; although she was only in her mid-fifties at the time, this was to be her last film. Of course, it could be argued that her career effectively came to an end nearly twenty years earlier with the failure of A Farewell to Arms, following which she only made a handful of films). There is a contrast here with a more recent disaster movie, Titanic, which integrated its human story with the spectacular disaster sequences much more successfully. Although neither Leonardo di Caprio nor Kate Winslet give particularly distinguished performances, it could not be said that we hardly notice what happens to Jack and Rose in that film.Of the human stars on display by far the best is Steve McQueen as O'Hallorhan, the tough and determined fire chief. O'Hallorhan also has a role as the mouthpiece for the film's social concerns; the idea seems to have been to start a debate not only about the ethics of putting profit before safety (a common theme in disaster movies, where the disaster is often caused, or at least exacerbated, by human greed or complacency) but also about the skyscraper culture itself. One of the most chilling moments comes when O'Hallorhan states that his men cannot effectively fight fires in buildings more than seven storeys high. If this is so, the public safety arguments against constructing something 135 storeys high (to say nothing of the aesthetic arguments) seem overwhelming, whatever the economic imperatives might be. An even more chilling moment comes at the end when he predicts that one day a fire like this could cost ten thousand lives, words which have taken on an added resonance since 9/11.Paul Newman's Roberts is perhaps a less interesting character, even though he spends most of the film bravely attempting to rescue people. Although Duncan bears some of the blame for the disaster, having deliberately turned a blind eye to Simmons's activities, the scriptwriter seems determined to acquit Roberts of any responsibility. It is made clear that he did not know that, and was not to blame for the fact that, his instructions about safety were being disregarded. It might, in fact, have been more dramatically effective if Roberts had had something with which to reproach himself; his subsequent bravery could therefore have been seen as an effort to redeem himself or regain his self-respect.The special effects, however, are well done for a movie that is more than thirty years old- well enough done to convince us that we are watching a real fire, not merely a film about a fire. The film is spectacular enough, and generates enough tension, to make it worth watching even today. 6/10.

One of the most memorable moments on the film features an adultery couple discovering that they are trapped under the flames with no way to escape. Richard Wagner desperately tries to reach the door with a lousy wet towel over his head while Susan Flannery (a young and beautiful Stephanie from The Bold and the Beautiful) is pushed closer and closer to the window. And the inevitable happens when she jumps. The 'rather falling than burning' is a reflex any human would have, fire scares more than heights, and in terms of death, at least, a fall promises a quicker death, but I don't think I need to go further on that subject. Beyond the spectacular premises, filmmakers cherished disaster films for one main reason the need of an all-star cast to develop all the parallel stories would guarantee an immediate commercial success. The Towering Inferno, directed by John Guillermin, obeys the rule with the most bankable stars of the 70's Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway and William Holden, not to forget the obligatory come-backs with two Golden Age legends Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones, who form a very sweet and endearing pair, Astaire as a sympathetic two-bit con-man will get an Oscar nomination for the role, in the same vein of sweet tenderness than Shelley Winters in The Poseidon Adventure'. By the way, I wish Jennifer Jones, as the elegant and good-hearted Lisolette, got a nomination, she was the heart of the film. And keeping on the stars' enumeration, there's naturally the obligatory villain through Richard Chamberlain as William Holden's cunning and cynical son-in-law. Paul Newman is the architect who built the San Francisco's skyscraper but he's in no case responsible for the disaster, it's Chamberlain, the cost-cutting manager, who didn't follow the specifications and ordered a wiring recommended by the Code, while the highest building ever built needed a more sophisticated, understand costly, material. Every disaster film has one or two bastards, the man who asks a Captain to go faster, who believes a ship cannot sink, their point is to identify the real antagonist in the film, not Nature, but Men's arrogance and disrespect toward Nature. It's because of men who believe that technology or industrial jewels can triumph over natural elements that catastrophes happen. As McQueen explains to Newman There's no sure way for us to fight a fire in anything over the seventh floor, but you guys just keep building 'em as high as you can. These lines define the eternal discordance between men who respect nature and those who defy it. It's an eternal battle and if men triumphed on the longest term, it was never without a few disasters that taught them lessons of humility. And The Towering Inferno takes us for more than two-and-half hour of a thrilling combat between men and fire, the film drags a bit too long, but maybe some stunts or action sequences that get redundant were more interesting on the big screen. It starts with a shortcut with the wiring, naturally, and a small fire breaks out before it would take epic proportion and literally climb 70 floors, at the top of the building, on the 135th floor, a reception is given to celebrate the building's inauguration, talk about a bad omen, the mayor couldn't even cut the ribbon with the scissors. Never mind, a band sings We May Not Love Each Other Again, a reminiscence of The Morning After from The Poseidon Adventure (it even won the Oscar). It's only a matter of time before the fire would reach them, and naturally, they can't take the elevator, the fate of those who tried immediately discouraged them. Disaster is a sub-genre that follows many formulas, but it works well in The Towering Inferno for three reasons the special effects are top notch and never suspend our disbelief, the acting is superb and there's the writing. Not that the film impacted the minds through memorable details, but it has a shocking value in the way it distributes death with the same blindness than fate would have. There's a consensus that it's not just the bad guys who die in disasters, but they generally have the most gruesome deaths while the good ones, die either heroically or tragically. Even having that in mind, I was shocked, like many others, by the death of Lisolette, not that I didn't expect her to die in the beginning, but not after she risked her life to save a deaf woman, and after Newman's struggle to rescue her group. Life is a bitch sometimes. The film avoided the know-it-all kid or the overly scared young girl (thanks goodness) and it also allows some very subtle and profoundly human details, especially during the climactic explosion of the water tanks. Wearing glasses myself, I was pleasantly surprised when Holden put them off because this is something I would have done, but the most poignant moment was the build-up when the remaining men were choosing where to tie themselves. Imagine yourself in a situation where a simple choice can determine if you live or die, would you expect that a glass would break in your direction or a statue fall on you? Chilling existentialism.After air in Airport, water in The Poseidon Adventure and earth in Earthquake, it was only fitting that the most redoubtable and frightening of the four elements made the most spectacular and probably the best of all the disaster films of the 70's wave The Towering Inferno, nominated for Best Picture among so many distinguished masterpiece as The Godfather Part II and Chinatown.

The scenes of the building getting worse and worse are unsettling.

He loaded the cast with bankable stars, assembled an extensive behind-the-scenes team and was rewarded with a sizable hit (not to mention a Best Picture Oscar nomination).The story is pretty simple here; strictly high concept. Basically, a fire breaks out in the world's tallest skyscraper. Unfortunately there's a party going on upstairs and the fire is quickly spiralling out of control.The cast is star-studded to say the least. The two leads, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen, are good as always and there's plenty of talent in supporting roles. William Holden, Fred Astaire & Richard Chamberlain are particularly memorable while a few weak links like Robert Wagner & O.J. Simpson don't detract too much from the overall quality of the film.The screenplay by Stirling Silliphant does a decent job, considering that he had to synthesize two source novels. The character development may be somewhat inconsequential but the pacing of the movie never flags, despite the nearly three hour runtime. Ultimately, the movie is buoyed by its unique premise and abundance of action.The movie's direction is ably handled but hardly worth remarking on. The extensive sets are impressive but since they were meant to reflect the state of the art in architecture the movie's look is anything but timeless. However, the abundant special effects employed in destroying these immaculately constructed sets still impresses today. Also worth noting is John Williams's score, which has its moments though it isn't as iconic as his work that was soon to follow.In the end, I think that this is an underrated action movie. It may be a little slight but, then again, most action movies are. While it would be interesting to see this film remade, it just wouldn't be the same without the traditional special effects employed here. The Towering Inferno still stands as a monumental achievement in effects work, even if the melodrama of the plot doesn't rise to the same heights.

The best looking cinema epic without question. The bulk of the film is very good but one gets the feeling that the middle section could of been edited down a bit. Too slow in parts. The film has two sections that I make endless repeat viewings of...One The death of Robert Wagner and girlfriend. Note the acting in this scene. See the way the lovers look at each other just before Wagner leaves the room to face the flames. That is acting. Note the tragedy in the Williams score as Wagner walks through the flames that then kill him. Powerful stuff.Two After William Holden says I never thought a thing like this could happen. We are then treated to some mighty John Williams music playing over the chopper dropping the fire fighter onto the burning roof. Look at the flames on the roof top. The set designer made those flames look so good. Other 1970s disaster movies from Universal never understood that flames can look so good on film. It was a look unique to Irwin cinema. It has been reported that Irwin liked the look of flames and it shows on the screen...and the music is so perfectly matched to what is on screen with the brave fire fighter walking through the roof top flames. This is movie making for you. But the best is yet to come. The exploding water tanks. What a finish. What a bang. I think you need to be a guy to like the bang, bang stuff as women seem less thrilled by it. Am I wrong? The bang, bang stuff appeared in Irwin Allen television of the 1960s (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost In Space, etc) so we have those TV shows to thank for teaching Irwin a few explosive tricks.The look, the direction, the acting, the music, you can't make a disaster movie much better than this. However, this was not the end of Irwin Allen. Three more cinema released Irwin Allen disaster films came after this. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews or poor box office takings that this trilogy got! Killer bees, a funny Sally Field at sea and an active volcano! Irwin still had some energy left after the tower exploded and thrilled the world (and I have not even mentioned Irwin's under-rated 1970s TV stuff).

The film also features Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain (in an especially slimy turn as the contractor whose shortcuts in meeting safety codes may have been the cause of the fire), OJ Simpson, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, and Susan Flannery.

It's a lavish production - it comes across as a bit like what James Cameron might have put out in the 70's, although this is one of Irwin Allen's disaster movies. The spare no expense attitude to this film comes across in the unbelievably meticulous and believable sets, the excellent special effects revolving, of course, around the fire, and the assembling of a pretty high profile cast. The story of a huge fire breaking out in a massive high rise (I'm not exactly sure if it was mentioned how high this high rise was but it has to be at least 137 floors, since the people were on 135 and the water tanks were 2 floors above them) is well crafted - and this may be the only movie I've come across that's based on two (yes - 2) novels. It's suspenseful and the suspense is real. People begin dying pretty soon in and a few people die that you don't expect to die, so it's not especially predictable. It also offers a decent look at the methods firefighters might have used to battle such a blaze, and in fact the movie opened with a dedication to firefighters.And yet, for all that - something was not quite right. Also similar to some of James Cameron's later work, Irwin Allen seems to go a bit overboard with this. It's too much; it's too lavish. There's too much unnecessary filler. The story revolving around the attempts to defeat and escape the fire would have been quite sufficient, but in keeping with other 70's era disaster films Allen felt the need to insert melodrama into the script - certain soapy elements that really didn't do too much for the story. Those melodramatic additions add up, and lead to a movie that's needlessly almost 3 hours in length, when the basic story could have been told in much less.Irwin Allen could be well described as the Master of Disaster (with apologies to Apollo Creed!) A case could be made that The Towering Inferno is his best piece of work. It's not my favourite among the Allen movies I've seen, but this could be the best overall production he was ever responsible for, which is reflected in the fact that this was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. I think that's overdoing it a bit. I'd describe it as a good movie with more than a few shortcomings.

The plot hinges on defective wiring being discovered by the architect (William Holden) who finds that his original plans have not been followed in order to cut costs. Suspense builds as we see the first fire break out and escalates as the damage quickly spreads, cutting off escape routes for those celebrating the premiere opening of the tallest building in the world. The water-filled ending with Newman, Astaire and others strapping themselves for the release of gallons of water is a nail-biter. Well worth viewing for fans of action/disaster films.

The movie were made with huge budget and with highly acclaimed movie stars from that time. The story is simple, the cast is very good, but not that great, except Steve McQueen who shines among other. There is tension, shocking scenes, scary fire and explosions and scenes that is really memorable. The movie is fast, there is no boredom at all, and good (not so deep) presentation of any important character. This is why classic cinema have its quality, instead of todays shallow and weak character development or none, in most of the blockbuster movies today.

Paul Newman is the co-star playing an earnest architect whose toil for the world's tallest building turns to rubble as Richard Chamberlain's corner-cutting, cost-saving building contracting turns it into the world's tallest death trap. Steve McQueen is alongside Newman in top billing as the non-nonsense fire chief with more than a little contempt for those responsible for putting the lives of his crew at risk.Among the galaxy of stars assembled include Faye Dunaway as Newman's squeeze (nothing more than a handbag role), Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones as the ubiquitous senior citizens, William Holden as the building's manager and a veritable smörgåsbord of stars in all shapes, colours and sizes.

Some might argue that The Poseidon Adventure is superior but those people are all wet. This movie set the bar for disaster films and Hollywood has been using this formula and attempting to surpass it ever since. William Holden (James Duncan) has built a giant skyscraper that is the largest building in the world. Paul Newman (Doug Roberts) was the architect on the project. It's the grand gala opening of the Glass Tower and everyone is there for a fancy party at the top floor resturaunt. Woo that's looks like a fancy fun party it even has Fred Astaire in attendance. What could go wrong I mean OJ Simpson is working security?To Newman's dismay he soon learns that corners were cut when building the project and it has not been built to his specifications. In fact Holden's son in law Richard Chamberlain (Simmons) has been taking kick backs from the electrical contractors and the buildings wiring is substandard. What's that a small electrical fire on the 81's floor in a janitors closet? I am sure that is nothing to worry about. Well looks like it's a good thing that OJ called the fire dept because that fire is starting to get grow rapidly. Steve McQueen (Fire Chief Michael O'Hara) soon arrives on the scene to assess the fire and start kicking some ash. This is about the point when the picture really takes off on its trip to awesome town, if I told you any more plot details I would be spoiling all the fun. Let's just say that this beautiful tower of glass is now a raging inferno of death, and leave it at that. The stunts and FX in this film are top notch. Wow just check out that crazy CGI explosion. O that's right those are actual explosions and real actors and stunt people as there was no CGI. This films action holds up remarkably well after thirty eight years. The stunts are great and Newman and McQueen did a lot of them themselves as part of their well documented pissing contest on this production.While the plot maybe is a bit lacking and the dialogue a bit suspect at points those faults are glossed over by the director's penchant for killing off his stars. People die in spectacular fashion in this film. Similarly the tension created in the film is palpable. You won't even notice you have been watching the film for almost three hours when it reaches its climax. Did I mention this has Paul Newman and Steve McQueen starring in it?Both Newman and McQueen were at the top of their game when this film was made. Admittedly, McQueen has a bit more to work with. After all, he gets to be the fire chief and Newman is the architect of the building that is killing everyone. Interesting to note that both McQueen and Newman were paid exactly the same amount for this film and that McQueen insisted that they have the same number of spoken lines.

Littered throughout the building are a number of characters that represent different sections of society and people with different moral values. Sometimes these characters are pigeonholed into one character trait, but here most people are three dimensional. The action scenes and slow build up are phenomenal. Each one unfolds with the kind of tension that doesn't exist today, due to loud music and quick cuts.

This is the Gone with the Wind of disaster pictures. Even at the time, I felt there were things wrong with The Posiedon Adventure and Earthquake; the former had its biggest scene at the beginning and the annoying, trashy cop-hooker couple, the latter had a stupid collection of subplots which you could tell some the actors themselves were bored with.Not the Towering Inferno. The style and the tremendous scale of this film still inspire awe in me. The spacious interiors of the offices and penthouse have been criticized as cheesy; they weren't on the big screen then and sure, they were 60s-looking but that just cued me to the old Hollywood 'Scope vibe. For genuinely cheesy art direction, please report to Earthquake.Most important, the primeval human fear of being burned alive is at the heart of the plot. Even now, when I read about this happening to someone it makes me shiver. Oddly, this obvious fact hasn't been often commented upon by many commentators, yet it is what gives the movie its nightmarish kick.SPOILERS Besides having the largest cast of major stars ever in one epic motion picture (something never duplicated to this day), it has so many scenes that stay in the memory, like Paul Newman, knocked unconscious by an explosion in a staircase zillions of stories up, sliding down the tangled wreckage to certain doom until he recovers just in time.The pyrotechnics reach their apex at the end, and that's breathtaking. But to many, the most memorable sequence occurs between Robert Wagner and his secretary Susan Flannery, trapped in an inner office after a tryst. Here far deeper emotions are plumbed. Trysts in offices are not unknown to us, but to end up being killed as an indirect result of it, geez&#133; Later, after Wagner has gone out into the inferno in a futile effort to get help, Flannery, who has seen what immediately happens to him, slams the office door and desperately tries to avoid the roaring flames for a few more minutes. We are made to identify with her and her reactions. Like we might be, Flannery is very frightened but still seems able (barely) to keep her head. However, we can sense she knows that like her lover she's going to die very soon. Which she does, in a graphic, terrible manner. The horror of this scene is hard to shake off.

I mean, here we have Holden, who has trusted his electric work in the not-so-capable hands of Chamberlain (owner of one hell of a house), who just happens to be his son-in-law. And then, for sentimentality, there's sweetie pie Jones who not only cares for the moppets, but proves to be Astaire's shot at redemption.All in all, a fun way to spend three hours, just as long as you have the right mindset.

After the huge success of the Poseidon Adventure, Irwin Allen received the nickname The Master of Disaster and began looking for his next big-Budget disaster picture to make and found The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. A few weeks later Warner Bros. announced they were making a similar movie based on the book The Tower by Richard Martin Stern. so instead of competing at the box office they would team up and each pay half the production costs. This would be the first time in Hollywood history that two major studios would team up to produce a single film. The films budget was $14 Million. a large amount for the time.In order for the picture to be a success Allen knew he need two big superstars in the leading roles. Hollywood legend Steve McQueen was offered a role and he quickly signed up. McQueen was originally offered the role of the architect but insisted on the role of the fire chief. After he was cast as the fire chief, he said to find someone of his box office caliber to play the other part and he suggested Paul Newman for the architects role. McQueen and Newman had both been looking for a project to do together since the 50's. After both actors were signed they were both demanding top billing and finally an agreement was made were Steve McQueen's name would be in the bottom left corner and Paul Newman's would be in the top right corner, thus making it look like each man had top billing, but McQueen was the one who truly got top Billing.The film grossed $116 Million.Both McQueen and Newman were paid 1 million plus 7.5% of the gross.This film ranks in my top five best movies ever made. It has a lot of that movie magic and outstanding special effects that audiences love and it story is on of heroism and bravery of the firefighters who are sent in to fight the deadly blaze. It's a great movie to watch anytime and the whole family can watch it and remember. It's a movie that has stood the test of time and will never grow old from repeated viewing.

The Towering Inferno is among the classic disaster movies, along with Charlton Heston's Earthquake and Gene Hackman's Poseidon Adventure. Just like others I saw Armagueddon, Dante's Peak, Volcano and the most recent epic, Day After Tomorrow, they are all very good but nothing come even close than the 70's disaster movies because at that time the producers use different small scale models to achieve their goals and they were very good at it!

Then I realized that you can't clone a classic.The Towering Inferno is, and will probably be, the only best disaster movie of all time!

This is the pinnacle of old-style, non-think, glamorous, suspenseful entertainment. Take a horde of stars--old and new--dress them up, stick them in the world's tallest building, light a match and watch her go. This magnificent film, containing a galaxy of movie stars and effects that hold up more than 25 years later, has been unfairly maligned since Sept 11th, 2001. Suddenly, it's no longer appropriate to watch and enjoy a film about a burning skyscraper. Anyone with a soul would be devastated by what happened to the WTC, but it doesn't defray affection for this piece of Hollywood history which is unrelated to that recent tragedy except for the type of setting. Is it strange to find entertaining a film which depicts hundreds of people trapped in a blazing building, fighting for their lives? Perhaps. But no more strange than finding Schwarzenegger, Willis and Stallone films entertaining in which dozens of people are graphically slaughtered before the viewers' eyes as they cheer for more! At least this film has an emphasis on heroism. It shows characters having regret for what they've allowed to happen and displays the risks that firemen take to complete their duties. Aside from all of that, there's an irresistible cast (irresistible if you have any knowledge of films made before 1990!) working in a landmark film (the first pairing of two major studios to work on one film) and delivering the goods in spades. Newman is flawless as an identifiable everyman who had a dream, but let it get out of his hands. His disbelief at the events and his sometimes futile efforts to halt them are believable. McQueen is no cardboard hero. He has a smart mouth, but a compassionate core. The weight he gives this role and the interrelations with Newman make the film special. Dunaway is a dream come true. Her every move, every glance calculated for maximum impact and attention. She was never more beautiful (though underutilized!) and she and Newman are a couple to root for. Watch the way she maneuvers her gossamer dress to retain focus during the crowd scenes. Holden is perfect as the bureaucratic builder who's too busy glad-handing everyone to see what's gone on. The remaining cast performs beautifully as well in their underdrawn characterizations, bringing life and, in some cases, a generation of movie memories to their roles. In the 1990's, an effort was made to revitalize and rejuvenate the disaster genre. Audiences were treated to every conceivable type of havoc and chaos and almost every one of those films was AWFUL. And all of them (except Titanic) was missing the one ingredient that nearly all of the 1970's films had.....GLAMOUR! Who cares if a tunnel blows up or a small town gets razed or a barn blows over??!!! But if a luxury liner or a plush private jet or the world's tallest building is in trouble, then you have people's attention. And so what if someone in jeans and a t-shirt gets dirty? Try it in evening gowns, jewels and tuxedos and NOW you have some visually arresting moments. Think not? Imagine Shelley Winters (in Poseidon) having her big swim in a pair of stirrup pants.....or Faye Dunaway on the roof of the tower in jeans.....or Stella Stevens (in Poseidon) just trotting up the Christmas tree in her khakis without having to change. Nobody got it. It's the tragedy of something beautiful being destroyed that's intriguing. In this film, everything is splendid and opulent, but when it's over, only the important things remain....what's wrong with that?

I was only 11 years old at the time, of course. But even then I sensed that this was more than just another disaster epic with flames everywhere and sirens going off and cool explosions and endless thrilling shots of dizzying heights and big and little people plunging to their deaths. Those things were exactly what I wanted as an 11 year old boy. But if you look closely, THE TOWERING INFERNO offers more than that. Much more. Though it's framed as a disaster picture with tons of special effects, the story has the scope and emotional impact of a mini series or a very high class soap opera. There are dozens of relationships being played out with life and death at stake. You see happy marriages, unhappy marriages, committed relationships, adulterous relationships, and more. You see people who are redeemed by love and who sacrifice their lives for love. And you see people who are unworthy of love and incapable of it being destroyed by their own rat-like desire for survival at any price. The raging inferno reveals so much about the human heart!Take the justly celebrated senior romance between Fred Astaire as the dapper conman and Jennifer Jones as the wealthy widow who sees through him. Everyone remembers how charming Astaire was in the role, alternately devious and sincere, humble and courageous. Now here's a spoiler. What really stuck with me as a kid was not the brutal sadness of the love cut short but the final image of Astaire as a man reborn. He's lost his jacket, his career as a crook, and his true love is dead. And yet when he walks out of the blaze carrying his fallen angel's pet cat, you don't feel sorry for him. You feel in awe of him. This is tragedy and he's just experienced catharsis, big time. Love has changed him, and he is not the man he was. The love affair is not cut short, it's actually consummated, in a way you will not forget. Now a lot of people overlook the way other plots threads comment on the supreme beauty of the Astaire/Jones romance. Susan Blakely and Richard Chamberlain are the bickering young couple who don't love each other, yet many viewers miss the point here. She's the rich man's daughter, and her no good husband has caused the fire by cutting costs in an effort to suck up to the old man. But most reviewers say she's a spoiled princess who scolds her husband. That is completely not true! If you watch Patty closely, she's incredibly warm, patient, trusting and supportive. Watch the scene where the slimy young husband tries to slink away by himself, and sneak downstairs, only to come back charred and filthy dirty and sulk by himself at the bar. Patty doesn't scold him at this point. She walks right up to him, and even though he's filthy and she's dressed in diamonds and lace, she takes his face in her hands and asks very gently if he needs her. Prompting his immortal reply, this is what I need as he takes another drink! The point is, Patty isn't spoiled, she's practically a saint. Over and over she tells her husband that she's on his side, that she wants to help him live up to his potential and be the man she thinks he could be. Though she's young and a little naive, she's every inch the woman that Jennifer Jones' character is, and she relates to her man in exactly the same way. The only problem is, Richard Chamberlain is no Fred Astaire. When he rejects love, he rejects the possibility of change, and he dies. Kicking and screaming, in a spectacular wipe- out! But when I was 11, I thought, wow, that Patty is so beautiful and so kind and good and so amazingly strong! A spoiled princess she is not, and that's all I have to say about that. Now I give this movie 8 stars out of 10, only because the big, big, big stars -- Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, and Fay Dunaway -- aren't nearly as interesting as the minor characters. Even at 11 I could see that Newman and Dunaway were phoning it in, and clearly not that interested in the story (or each other.) Now that I'm a grown up, and have seen their earlier films, I can see why. They thought they were slumming here, and it shows. In fact every time Fay Dunaway looks at Paul Newman, I keep expecting her to say, Forget it, Luke -- it's Chinatown.

The trends who invited the greatest movie companies to show us terrible ways to die, fascinates me in present days. The view of the world must have been gloomy and gray, people still wanted to be shown moderate special effects of avalanches (salt) and skyscrapers fully set on fire. (Scale models.) Some of the characters always made it to the end of the tunnel for daylight, some were brutally roasted, the heroes who often sacrificed themselves for the crew.The Towering Inferno of 1974 is the one disaster i can re-visit from time to time. Mostly because of the very good casting, and the non-stop action after the entering of the flames. Steve McQueen was in first to act as the architect, but changed his mind. Thank You. Anyone imagine if Newman and McQueen would have been playing the other ones part? OK, If so, we could have discuss it either other way, today, because we wouldn't know anything else. The rest of the stars in this epic panic are just statistics for me; Newman grabs the steering wheel from the beginning, but almost has to move over to be co-driver, when fire chief McQueen enters the screen, jumping out of his car beside the chimney. Equal lines, equal top billing....yes you heard it all before. The great rivals of the 70's (especially McQueen) was apparently sick of ego, and didn't allow the other part to have an inch of attention, or a second more of limelight than the opponent. Today this movie is only remembered by many as a cult flick of the (first) disaster era; some will rank it the as the best, the most successful. Patterns are all there the love stories, the struggling family relations, the other template people you get to know briefly before the tragic sets in.

Indeed there are a lot of implausible moments, and after the destruction of the World Trade Center you can't help but make comparisons, but other than that it's a solid action movie.So what's the barbecue? We find ourselves in San Francisco, and it's the opening night of the Glass Tower, the world's tallest skyscraper at a height of 138 stories. As guests arrive, the architect, Doug Roberts, has doubts that the cheaply made electric system will be able to hold the intended light show, but his worries are sidelined so as not to rock the boat. Sure enough a fire does start and very soon the building is engulfed in flames, trapping hundreds of people at the top-floor restaurant.Now, the bad things. There are plenty of moments where the actions taken and the decisions made you can't help but think are insane. For example, when the initial fire is reported, the building's owner refuses to evacuate. At the same time, guiding people to the elevators when there's a fire, of course that's going to end well!At the same time, there's plenty of implausible things, such as running a Breeches Buoy between the two skyscrapers I think is a little out there, as well as the fact that there's a bit of a silly 'happy' ending that I won't give away, but will have you scratching your head in confusion. Although obviously the attacks on the Twin Towers hadn't happened yet, there are many things that are and aren't included in this movie that do seem questionable. For example, the fact that even though the best part of 100 floors are on fire, no smoke seems to be rising into the restaurant causing people to choke. Indeed in one of the original books on which this is based smoke rises into the floors causing people to wither.There are many inexplicable and random explosions within the structure which shouldn't happen since this is an electrical fire. For me, the most obvious problem is the fact that this building has been on fire for hours, and has apparently had several large explosions which are said to be near the core, yet it doesn't collapse not even partially. Of course the argument can be made that a fire in a large steel building had never happened before, but many shows and films prior to this depicting a devastating inferno in a tall building have the structure collapse or partially crumble. I know these are probably personal peeves, but they did have me confused.Other than that, there's nothing really wrong with this movie. Aside from the fact that there's some fantastic pyrotechnics, and the mixture of models and practical effects adds to the immersion in a story that back in 1974 would have been difficult to tell. One of the better parts of this movie are in fact the characters, who are all well developed, but at the same time seem human. While some of the characters make silly decisions, like why the couple in the office didn't escape when the fire was quite a way away rather than waiting for the flames to start licking at their door, or why the building wasn't evacuated the moment a fire was reported, other characters have novel little touches that make them seem much more relatable. My personal favourite moment is when Steve McQueen's character goes up in the elevator to inform the building's owner that the fire is out of control, whilst on the way he takes off his fireman's jacket and helmet so as not to cause a panic, which I found was a great touch because it shows he's a thinking and concerned Fire Chief, trying to maintain calm in such a difficult and dark situation.Overall, aside from some of the physical problems of implausibility with regard to some of the scenes, this is a very good, very entertaining action movie. Indeed the story isn't complex, simply just put out the fire without getting yourself killed, but it's the fact that it takes the time to give it a bit more a human touch than some of the other disaster movies of the time. I personally enjoy this film greatly as it manages to blend an unqualified tragic nightmare of a situation with realistic characters who you enjoy and want to see escape.

Following the big boat came this big skyscraper, and of course, this lead to his big disaster with an exploding volcano. Other copy-cat producers created movies about exploding blimps (three of them including a historical look back at The Hindenberg and two involving blimps hovering over crowded sporting events), rollercoasters flying off of their hinges, and of course, airplanes falling from the sky. All of them featured the most popular leading stars of the day and some surprising veterans making amusing comebacks.The Towering Inferno is a scary thought in a world still remembering the impact of 9/11, and when this movie first came out, the World Trade Centers had only been open for a short time. Like The Poseidon Adventure, an all-star cast gets together to celebrate a huge event, only to find their lives in jeopardy when disaster strikes. What it lacks in comparison to The Poseidon Adventure was that film's big heart, even though one of the plot lines attempted to keep that detail here. But this is a film about corporate greed and ego, and it is building owner William Holden's desire to own the world's tallest building, so perhaps it was intended for more of a message picture than one of holiday sentiment surrounded by tragedy.1950's rival tough guys (Paul Newman and Steve McQueen) fight over who will be the hero here, with Newman as Holden's partner and McQueen as fire chief. Newman is engaged to magazine editor Faye Dunaway which doesn't mean much because the storyline surrounding their relationship is never really developed and Dunaway, very busy in films in 1974, really has little to do. The most interesting storyline surrounds conman Fred Astaire (in an Oscar Nominated role) and his younger lady love (veteran actress Jennifer Jones) and their attempts to get out of the burning building. Susan Flannery, then at the top of her popularity on daytime's Days of Our Lives, got a great deal of attention as one of the fire's victims.The set-up to the cause of the fire and how it spreads takes up much of the film's three hour running time, and moves into the attempts to rescue those trapped inside. Special effects are amazing, and overall, the film is extremely entertaining. However, an attempt to create another hit song like The Morning After (from The Poseidon Adventure) is missed with We May Never Love Like This Again which did go on to win an Oscar but is certainly not as well remembered as Maureen McGovern's previous hit. She actually gets to appear on screen here, singing a bit of the song, unlike in Poseidon.Fans of Astaire will be surprised to learn that this was his only trip to the Oscars as a nominee, never having been nominated for any of his classic musical films. He basically plays a non-singing, barely dancing version of all his other characters, the charming, dashing older man who just happens to be an ex-con. Jones is still gorgeous thirty years after receiving her Oscar. Other stars try to make an impression in the film, but sadly, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughan and then football hero O.J. Simpson end up sidetracked when compared to the impact of the other stars. While this is far from being a miss, it is certainly not worthy of the hype it had at the time, especially its inclusion as an Oscar Nominee for Best Picture.

Inhabitants initially think the small fire, resulting from an electrical short, is no big deal, but - this being an Irwin Allen disaster production - they are sadly mistaken as The Towering Inferno lights up the sky and heats up the audience. The Poseidon Adventure (1972) remains Mr. Allen's best film, but this one represents the peak of his filmmaking powers. For starters, he gets a great budget from two major studios, and spends it well. Allen could work wonders with small budgets, and big ones too...Fire means more grisly, less dignity...Leading the heroics are not one, but two of Quigley Publications top ten money-making stars for the year, #3 Paul Newman (as Doug Roberts) is the architect, and #5 Steve McQueen (as Mike O'Hallorhan) plays the fire chief. Next up are non-slouching builder William Holden (as James Duncan) and Mr. Newman's girlfriend Faye Dunaway (as Susan Franklin); he cut costs to cause the disaster and she likes to tease her nicely kept figure. The Golden Age movie stars are con man Fred Astaire (as Harlee Claiborne) and widow Jennifer Jones (as Liselotte Mueller); he won acting honors and she makes her final film leap...Some will live, some will die...Arguably the next two in importance are Mr. Holden's son-in-law Richard Chamberlain (as Roger Simmons) and modeling wife Susan Blakely (as Patty). Then, there's the senator Robert Vaughn (as Gary Parker) and the publicity man Robert Wagner (as Dan Bigelow). Football player and killer O.J. Simpson (as Jernigan) wouldn't harm a cat. Other notable appearances include Brady kid Mike Lookinland, soap opera star Susan Flannery, Allen's longtime companion Sheila, and Newman's handsome son Scott. There is no appearance by either Bob Denver (as Gilligan) or Jerry Mathers (as the Beaver), but have fun anyway...******** The Towering Inferno (12/10/74) Irwin Allen  John Guillermin ~ Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway "},{"Title":"A good movie","Date":"25 June 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" For an aged film made when disaster movies were really only beginning to be appreciated, this is a great film. The actors are absolutely superb and this film is full of big name stars (of the time), and the special effects are pretty good considering the films age. Some parts of the film aren't particularly entertaining but mostly this film is pretty good. It doesn't compare at all to modern disaster films like The Day After Tomorrow or 2012, but even if it was made in the 21st century like these films you couldn't really compare it - both of those films feature absolutely huge disasters, whereas this only features a small one. So if you like older films, don't mind that some parts of this aren't very entertaining, and enjoy watching disaster movies, this is the film for you.

During the gala opening of the world's tallest building in San Francisco, a substandard wire shorts out in a maintenance room and sets off a conflagration endangering the lives of its builder (William Holden), its architect (Paul Newman), the architect's girlfriend (Faye Dunaway), and hundreds of extras.Irwin Allen seemed to design his productions to entertain 12-year-olds. You need a lot of patience to sit through the opening exposition, and lines that just scream scripting rather than talking. I think you suffer from an 'edifice complex.' I'm not a cheeseburger, you know. You're better. All protein, no bread. All I want is the man I thought I married. 730 sharp. I hope you like your men prompt. At my age, I only care that they show up at all. Find me the architect who designed you, and who needs Doug Roberts? If I ever take you for granted, do something about it. I believe in all good things. With all that wooden dialogue, no wonder the place is such a firetrap.Two things make The Towering Inferno good enough all the same. One is an incredible set of stunts, involving both fire and water, that amaze beyond the pedestrian storyline. The other is Steve McQueen, proving here that while he may never have been the world's greatest actor, he was one of filmdom's finest action stars, playing the part of a fire chief with a winning world-weariness and absence of ego. Once he arrives at around the 45th minute, The Towering Inferno kicks into a higher gear and never slows down.I also enjoyed Richard Chamberlain's performance as the slimy electrical contractor, responsible for the faulty wiring at the heart of the disaster but only caring about his miserable skin. In most movies, a character like his is too ridiculous to bear scrutiny, but here you enjoy someone with the moxie to say lines as snide as Baby, I don't need God's help with a straight face.The rest of the cast is largely superfluous, as aimlessly scripted by Sterling Silliphant and directed by John Guillermin (Allen himself directed the best parts, its action scenes). Fred Astaire shrugs and grins his way to one of the oddest Oscar-nominated performances as an aging conman, while Robert Vaughn is parceled off a couple of lines as the film's biggest-name extra. Holden's main job is to look concerned, Dunaway's to remind us Newman's architect character isn't gay.Newman seems wasted, too, until the second half of the film gives him something to do other than flash his blues and look concerned. James Hitchcock suggests in another IMDb review that Newman's potential culpability in the disaster should have been played out more, and indeed it would have given his character more shading. Newman was great with antiheroes.There can really be only one hero in a film like this one McQueen. What a marvel he was, whether it was playing his discomfort with his equipment, his tired resignation at having to save another bunch of lives, or his one-word response to Dabney Coleman's suicide assignment.Who pays to see us play? one of McQueen's comrades asks, just before McQueen looks right into the camera. They paid McQueen an obscene amount of money to be in this film. He was worth every penny.

Of course there are big holes in it and, no, I don't need anyone to point out to me that there's no reason to kick in a door that just opened a crack for you, or that a helicopter can't drop anybody off right at the side of the building. You just accept this as a 1974 legacy, as you do the wretched performances of OJ Simpson and Fred Astaire, and the mugging work of Richard Chamberlain and Bill Holden. It's all worth it. When are we again going to see those lingering crowd moments wherein everyone has to 'act distressed' for minutes at a time? How can you forgo the joy of what you know (as the fire chief should know) are crucial seconds ticking away, as Holden slowly accepts that, yes, the guests must go? AND THEN takes a minute to yell at his son-in-law before making the announcement? This stuff is priceless. And, cheesy or not, the movie just takes you all the way in. Go with it.

I recently watched this and the Poseidon Adventure quite close together and believe this is the weaker film due to its ambition probably. Its much too long for a start and due to the length its not as tense as it should be. The effects are still good for the time and the acting is decent. Some of the set pieces are great but overall it dragged too much. The beginning is paced very well and each character has enough time to breathe and come to life before the disaster happens. Its probably the second half of the movie that lets it down as it tends to sag at times.

The Towering Inferno is about the tallest skyscraper in the world that starts burning out of control after bad wiring causes a flare-up in a storage room. I was scared to death when I watched this film the first couple of times on TV when I was a kid. It doesn't scare me today, but now I find the movie exciting, suspenseful, and mind-boggling. Like The Poseidon Adventure, Allen got a big name cast to participate in the film. Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, and O.J. Simpson star, with early film appearances by Dabney Coleman (of 9 to 5 and TV's Buffalo Bill) and Susan Flannery (Emmy winning star of the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful). Big time actors, but like most disaster movies, the big star here is the special effects. Very impressive. The cinematography and editing (which won Oscars) play a big part in the film as well. The only thing that can be considered negative about The Towering Inferno is the script. Like all of Irwin Allen's disaster films (as well as disaster films not produced by Allen), this one has its share of idiotic dialogue. Usually a movie that has this element bothers me like it did in the disaster films of the late '70s. But I didn't let that bother me with this film (same goes for The Poseidon Adventure). The action scenes and special effects are so spectacular, along with some good performances (particularly by Astaire and Jones), that it makes The Towering Inferno a great suspense thriller.

You know you are in for something big when the movie trailer or the DVD packaging boasts that this film, winner of three Academy Awards and also nominated for Best Picture of 1974 features dazzling special effects, a star studded cast and has a run time of 165 minutes.  In that regard, The Towering Inferno does not disappoint. Watching it is like watching a major event on tv.  You will sense that something big is happening.The world's tallest skyscraper has just been completed in San Francisco, California and the builder is planning a gala even on the top floor (where else!) to celebrate the event.  Society's most prominent people are in attendance and the dedication begins with much fanfare.  Unfortunately, the builder's (William Holden) son-in-law (Richard Chamberlain) has cut corners and done shoddy work on the tower's electrical system to save money.  When all the lights are turned on, electrical problems occur and a fire rages on the 81st floor.  It soon becomes evident that all of the revelers at the top of the building in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor will not be able to get out of the building alive.  The architect of the tower (Paul Newman) and the Chief of the Fire Department (Steve McQueen) race against time and other obstacles to rescue as many people as they can.  Who will live and who will perish becomes the question as the first group going down the elevator is burned alive and as the brave firemen begin to die in attempts to rescue those trapped at the top.  A helicopter crashes in the high wind in attempt to execute a rescue effort by landing on the top of the building and the situation becomes more desperate by the minute.The Towering Inferno is a movie not to be missed if you are a fan of disaster movies.  It does not disappoint at all in that regard.  It is a blockbuster in the sense that James Cameron's Titanic was a blockbuster hit when it was released but is already showing signs of not having enough substance to maintain its initial popularity.  Unfortunately, it has some major flaws which undoubtedly will prevent it from ever being considered a classic movie. The most glaring shortcoming is the lack of character development.  Three of the film's main characters (played by Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Faye Dunaway) are so one dimensional that they seem fake. Another corresponding problem is that some of the dialogue in The Towerning Inferno is just plain corny and it's unbelievable that real people would ever have uttered such tripe.  The surprise is that the actress Jennifer Jones manages to steal the show by breathing life into her character. William Holden does a decent job with his role also.Give The Towering Inferno a chance and watch it once to see what all the hype is about but don't expect it to compare to true classic movies like The Lord of the Ring The Fellowship of the Ring, Gone With The Wind, or the Wizard of Oz.  A movie like this with major flaws just can't stand the test of time.  I give it an 83/100 points.  Burn baby burn!

Conceived by producer-co-director Irwin Allen as a followup to his box-office smash The Poseidon Adventure, no expense was spared to sign an authentic all-star cast, put them in the world's largest roman candle and let the audience sweat out the obvious question  who will live and who will die?  It was a successful formula, at least in this incarnation, and the resulting spectacle makes the tacky imitations that were released around it (the Airport sequels, The Hindenburg, Earthquake, and Allen's own woeful later attempts at recapturing the magic) look positively abysmal in comparison.One of the only films of the genre to have a truly all-star cast instead of merely a ragtag assortment of television and silver-screen has-beens, The Towering Inferno boasts an impressive lineup  co-leads Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, top female star Faye Dunaway, silver screen legends William Holden, Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire, top television stars Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn and Richard Chamberlain, and gridiron great (long before he became a national disgrace) O.J. Simpson.  Only forgotten starlet Susan Blakely seems out-of-place among this talent.  Also impressive is the fact that Allen's special effects team, working long before the advent of digital technology, was able to craft special effects that still look impressive nearly 30 years later. Indeed, the sequence in the glass elevator, the climactic, last-ditch effort to douse the fire and save lives, and Paul Newman's and Jennifer Jones' journey up the building to safety in the middle of the film remain believable and impressive action spectacles.For those who don't know, the plot revolves around the dedication ceremony of the world's tallest building, which has (illogically) been built in San Francisco, along with Los Angeles the earthquake capital of the United States and therefore within the jurisdiction of California's moratorium on skyscrapers above 75 stories.  But ignoring this plot hole, the film proceeds in placing the above cast in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor for a all-out gala celebration.  When a fire breaks out on the 80th (or so) floor due to faulty wiring, architect Paul Newman tries to persuade builder William Holden to move the party downstairs, but he refuses, saying they're perfectly safe in such a well-constructed building.  By the time fire chief Steve McQueen orders the party downstairs, it's too late--the fire is out of control and it becomes apparent that not everyone will make it out alive.As much as I like this film, I must say flaws are prevalent.  The most glaring is in Richard Chamberlain's hissable villain character.  He is so over-the-top all he needs is a handlebar mustache to twirl ala Snidely Whiplash.  And it's unbelievable that such a dispicable man could not only wed the boss's daughter (Blakely), but that Holden wouldn't have seen through this charletain's act and kicked him to the curb long before. (He's the building's cost-cutting electrician who's faulty wiring causes the fire.)  Also, the film goes over-the-top to kill off some of the cast in rather gruesome means.  (One particular legend and audience favorite's death is so horrible, in fact, that the audience I saw it with groaned with disgust when it happened.)  And considering the events of 9/11/01, watching beloved actors falling 135 stories to their deaths will no-doubt be extremely disturbing to some.To wrap this up, The Towering Inferno is an authentic action classic. Unfortunately, it had the misfortune of being nominated Best Picture alongside such masterpieces as Godfather 2, Chinatown, The Conversation, and Lenny, and over authentic classics like Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Murder on the Orient Express, and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in one of the all-time great movie years 1974. So it's been maligned by critics ever since for something that wasn't even its fault.  But viewing it for what it is--an action spectacle, nothing more, nothing less--it's a topnotch effort, a two-and-three-quarter hour thriller that thrills and never bores.  And that's all an audience can wish for.  ***1/2 (out of *****) "},{"Title":"Tall Tale","Date":"27 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Towering CritiqueThis movie is the last word in 1970s Disaster Films.

Even the best efforts of the batallion chief (Steve McQueen) and the building's architect (Paul Newman) can only save some of the frightened people.  The climax, in which the water storage tanks are exploded to douse the fire, is brilliantly handled.Irwin Allen, the Master of Disaster, produced this 165 minute-long epic, and (save for the action sequences) allowed John Guillermin to direct.  Given the penchant for disaster films to be reduced to soap opera theatrics, it should be said that most of the acting and dialogue in THE TOWERING INFERNO are surprisingly low-key and to-the-point.  The huge cast of all-stars (besides McQueen and Newman, who never fail to impress) includes William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Susan Blakely, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain (the heavy in this deck of cards), O.J. Simpson (don't laugh; he's not on for too long), Fred Astaire, and Jennifer Jones.  John Williams' tension-filled score and the excellent effects work of L.B. Abbott and A.D.

So I had to make do with Peter Pan instead.Previous movies such as Airport and the Poseidon Adventure had laid the way for the diaster genre. But Irwin Allen outdid himself with this classic action movie. I can't recall seeing more stars in one film. As with all diaster movies, this was crucial, because the plots were usually humdrum. You had to enjoy the special effects and relish the spectacle of you favourite star being killed to get throught themI love cliches in this film eg Paul Newman to Robert Wagner - We almost had a fire Robert Wagner - What, in this buildingWilliam Holden to Paul Newman There is no way a fire can go from 83 to 138. Not in this building. Now come on down and enjoy the partyAt the end of the day what makes this film watchable over & over is not the plot. It isn't even the special effects. It is that the greatest cast ever assembled putting there all into it, and that's Hollywood.Oh, and I guess in the back of everyone's mind is that lurking fear that it easily happen to them. Inferno was, and still is the greatest action film with a feasible plot.

William Holden, the builder of the building, is forced to come down to reality and accept humility as the events unfold.The film definitely served as a wake-up call to making sure that high-risers are properly structured and can withstand the effects of a fire.Paul Newman, as an architect and Steve McQueen, as a fire chief, certainly added to the tension and dilemma faced by those inside the building. Their cool headed ways certainly brought about the savings of a number of lives.The film is action packed while showing the lives of those involved in the predicament. Women in the film certainly had subordinate roles.

The spectacle and scale of what is projected on the screen to take the audience's breath away, irrespective of plot, characters and dialogue, the main things that make a movie, for sure, but since projected images began, this has been the main purpose of the 'event' movie, the 'effects' movie, the 'blockbuster' movie, call it what you will. From King Kong climbing the Empire State Building in his first appearance in 1933, to Gort's arrival on Earth in 1951 with The Day the Earth Stood Still, all the way to Irwin Allen's The Towering Inferno in 1974, which was ahead of it's time and certainly set the standards for others to follow, while still upholding the cinematic integrity of good writing and characters that gradually became less and less important over the years, all the way up to about Twister in 1996 where people started to complain...For starters, it got the ball rolling on the 'all star cast list' for such a movie, with Steve McQueen doing his quintessential tough guy role as the no nonsense fireman and Paul Newman as the bewildered architect whose dream project crumbles to pieces before his eyes, as well as an undeniably less important supporting cast including the likes of Faye Dunaway, former champion dancer Fred Astaire (really an actor?) and former pro footballer O.J. Simpson (really an actor?) It's also the first movie of it's kind to throw up the implausibility bar, although this may be more to do with less knowledge at the time of the causes of death in fire, such as not using lifts, carbon monoxide inhalation being the most likely killer, the lack of high risers and so forth. But the sheer ambition and scale of Allen's production far outweighs these, a nearly three hour long production where the human drama and solid writing keeps things rolling just as much, if not more so than the breath taking set pieces and heart stopping suspense.It all feels from a day and age where cinema was more about quality and care and made with more heart and passion than the made to order, insincere franchise films we are bombarded with today and, as long as they keep making money, still will be. **** "},{"Title":"Cheesy but a solid watch.

As such, The Poseidon Adventure and this film usually are considered the best examples of the genre. Neither are great films, although The Towering Inferno has aged better than The Poseidon Adventure. A group of all-star luminaries gather for a gala celebration in the penthouse of the newly constructed world's tallest building in San Francisco, but due to the shoddy electrical work by craven Richard Chamberlain, a fire breaks out on one of the higher floors trapping everyone within the burning building.If your cup of tea is pyrotechnics, then this is definitely the film for you. Between the explosions, burning bodies and flaming people plummeting to their deaths, you will really have it made. More discerning viewers will have to take solace in the cast, the set design and a handful of exciting moments. The film is ridiculously long, a good deal of the time spent on rather pallid character development in the protracted opening. The writing is definitely not this film's strong point and barely holds attention until the next action piece.Unlike The Poseidon Adventure, where a number of the leads get killed by the climax - one has to really proceed down the cast list before encountering the first fatality among the supporting players. Apparently being a leading player has its rewards. Steve McQueen, as the fire chief, and Paul Newman, as the architect, are both first-rate, although they are really just cruising along on their substantial charisma rather than acting. William Holden as the owner of the building has it rougher. It is impossible to understand whether we are supposed to like him or not. He places people in jeopardy for his own selfish means and obviously bears some degree of culpability for the shoddy work in the building, but veers back and forth between being noble and obnoxious. It is terrific to see Fred Astaire back on screen (and in a non-musical role), but why is his role so forgettable? Given the outrageous length of the picture, he literally has nothing to do but make unconvincing goo-goo eyes at the younger Jennifer Jones, extinguish the flames on one stunt man and shake his head in regret...and that is it. For this, he got an Oscar Nomination? Richard Chamberlain is on hand as the typical one-note bad guy, while one cannot help but be pulled out of the action every time O.J. Simpson makes an appearance, for obvious reasons. Robert Vaughn's role as a compassionate politician seems to have mostly been left on the editing floor, while Robert Wagner's most memorable moment in the film is being incinerated.The actresses have almost nothing to do. Susan Blakely barely registers in the ill-defined role of Holden's ornamental daughter and Chamberlain's clueless wife. One wonders why Faye Dunaway is in this film at all, unless the boon of a love scene with Newman was too much to turn down. For the entire duration, her only personality trait is that she is Newman's girlfriend. She primps about in a designer gown and barely manages the feat of looking concerned. The film barely utilizes her at all and her fourth billing is a bit ludicrous. Jennifer Jones fares best as a secretary and Astaire's love interest. She plays the only character that seems to harbor a genuine emotion, gets to act heroically and participates in one of the film's most tense passages where she, Newman and two children must desperately make their way down a destroyed staircase over perilous drops. Her shock death later in the film seems more than a tad cheap as she is one of the few characters - other than the two male leads - to generate any rooting interest, and the film could easily have generated the same shock by shifting the dramatic death to Dunaway - thus giving her character at least some reason for being in the film.The final moments of the film are indeed thrilling and the elevator rescue is also notable. Definitely for fans of this genre, but anyone looking for any kind of depth is hereby warned to look elsewhere.

You couldn't help but take this one seriously because it had the two leading Hollywood hunks of the day in starring roles. Neither Paul Newman nor Steve McQueen would ever have signed-up for a turkey. Even then, the list of players was something of a who's who, with William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, and many more. Credits role to a vertiginous helicopter ride with grand, sweeping vistas of San Francisco and the Golden Gate bridge. It's a worthy taster of the spectacle to come. Like other disaster flicks, there's a lengthy preamble to develop the characters and establish their roles and relationships. By modern day standards it takes a very long time before we feel the need for a hose-pipe. But the directing, acting, and personal conflicts still prove sufficient to retain viewer interest. The script could have been better, though. In due course; we have a fire. On the big screen it was a creditable performance for its time. But the ferocity of a major conflagration is never fully realised. Perhaps the movie-makers were a little wary of mega-buck lawsuits if their stars ever caught a singe. Real fire is a genii turned dragon. It blooms and spreads like magic. The roar is fit to deafen you. Shattering glass, crackling combustibles, the billowing draughts of heat are almost dream-like and mesmerising. They impact upon the senses and psyche in equally stultifying measure. Burning and charred detritus fly and eddy on the currents like a tumultuous flock of birds. Smoke is scalding, impenetrable and invariably poisonous. Trust me; I've been there.Perhaps the most believable moment is when Robert Wagner's character attempts to run through a burning room. Here we see a doomed man because the temperature of air and gas alone would have roasted his lungs when he breathed. Interestingly, we see him spontaneously ignite, which is what would certainly happen. It's a terrifyingly candid moment that is - even today - often edited when shown on television. One or two other elements are also usually cut, including the vulnerable nudity of Wagner's soon-to-be-roasted love interest. Once the match is lit, the whole movie runs at a good steady lick. A tall building provides opportunities for many of our favourite terrors, especially vertigo. And here again we are not spared the fear of falling, whether down fathomless service-shafts, or from damaged elevators and cable-chairs. The concept is milked for everything it's worth and even today presents some hair-raising edge-of-the seat stuff. Finally it becomes an ordeal of fire and water. If it wasn't enough to cook the actors, the director means to drown 'em. A huge water tank is exploded above so that the contents will rain down on the burning lower floors and extinguish the blaze. Frankly; that's a bit of a crock. So much water would simply find the easiest way out of the building - the glass windows - which were destroyed in the blast. The idea that it would steadfastly percolate down level by level, entering every corridor and every room, wetting every surface and stifling every flame is nonsense. We see the tower by long shot as the fires systematically die away and flicker out like a party-trick. Pure hokum. That aside; as a piece of drama, it is about as intense and engaging as you could still wish for. Most of the sets and scenes are fairly believable and the fire-fighting techniques genuine. I believe the brigade were consulted during the movie's making. And you also get to see Hollywood's finest sparring away in the same movie. Two points of note despite being made in the mid 1970's and therefor on the cusp of feminist virulence, we see heroic Paul Newman insisting that the ladies (and children) must be rescued first. And non of them raise an indignant objection. Tut-tut, sisters; where's the equality then? Secondly; in the light of 9/11, it seems probable that this tower would also have collapsed from heat-induced structural failure. Do catch it if you haven't already. Far worse offerings have been made since this (just check-out 'Armageddon'). And remember; there is no CGI stuff here. What you see is largely what you get.

Now why would I write that? Let's see. Why would I WRITE THAT? Is it because I just read in the Trivia section that principal filming of The Towering Inferno wrapped up on September 11, 1974? I think so. Nobody in 1974, not even Irwin Allen, the authors of the books on which the movie was based, and not even the screenwriter, were aware that 27 years after its release, THE REAL TOWERING INFERNO would happen, when Al Qaeda flew two planes into the World Trade Center and brought them to the ground. Steve McQueen's character, Chief O'Hallorhan, remarks that the ladders of his fire engines can't reach above the 74th floor. Chilling. High rise buildings like the World Trade Center, the newly proposed Freedom Tower, and the original MGM Grand Hotel, have a glaring flaw in their designs. One that wasn't corrected in the 31 years since The Towering Inferno was shown in theaters. That deficiency is the same as it was in 1974. The ladders of the fire engines still can't reach above the 74th floor. High rises, like the World Trade Center, don't have external fire escapes. They have internal fire stairs and elevators. In The Towering Inferno, they tried to get the people down in the elevators. BAD IDEA. Why? Because the elevator cables can break in a fire and send those inside hurtling to their deaths if the breaks fail. So to whom was The Towering Inferno dedicated to? Firefighters. In the movie, it was a short circuit that caused the fire. If it was made today, then it would probably be brought down by terrorists. That's what it's come to in this post-9/11 world. I wish I was back in the '70s right now. We were so naive and innocent. We've lost our innocence and we can't get it back.

Many scenes, including the action ones, are overlong. There is just too much rescue scenes, too much hero shots, too much victim shots, etc. The between-action dialogue is cheesy, and overall reminds me of Dynasty.And I can't stand how shamelessly this movie plays with pathos (every scene involving children and Fred Astaire, for example) and that every character that is to die does so with so much dramatization (the noble exception is Jennifer Jones's character, who just disappears out the window).So, to sum it up, the Towering Inferno is an action-packed eye candy, supposed to frighten people and occasionally does, but is too long and filled with unnecessary clichés.

At the building's well-lit gala opening, the building's electrical system overloads, causing a small fire. Unnoticed, and then later not taken seriously, the fire erupts into an epic story, in Irwin Allen's The Towering Inferno. This 1974 film is technically well made. It has good cinematography, special effects, production design, and acting. But, typical of 70's disaster movies, the film suffers from routine characters and a predictable plot. Some of the romantic sub-plots are right out of The Love Boat.Adapted from a couple of novels, The Towering Inferno is fictional. That fact, plus the distraction of having a cast of way too many big-name Hollywood stars, makes it too easy for viewers to dismiss the film's serious theme. Superficially, the director addresses the tragic consequences, when the greed creed usurps public safety, but I would have preferred that this theme be more --- blunt.In real life, just three years after this film was made, 165 people were killed near Cincinnati, Ohio, in a fire that destroyed the elegant Beverly Hills Supper Club. The cause of that fire was --- substandard wiring.As recently as 2003, one hundred people were killed in a preventable fire at a nightclub in Rhode Island. And in 1903, over 600 people were killed in a fire at the plush Iroquois Theater in Chicago. Like the building in The Towering Inferno, the Iroquois had just opened for business. Owners were fully aware of the lack of safety measures, but wanted to maximize profits from the busy Christmas movie season, and thus opened the theater prematurely. Many of the fire victims were children.As a medium to convey ideas and foster discussion, film can educate as well as entertain.

On the big grand opening, three-hundred people are at the top of the building when a fire breaks out below. The fire chief (Steve McQueen) arrives but he realizes that survival odds aren't that good.Of all the disaster films to come from this era, this one here is perhaps the best for a number of reasons but coming right after THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE the genre was still taking itself rather serious so we got rather good stories, strong performances and great special effects. As the genre wore on these elements became less and less important until we got to some of the worst that the genre had to offer. This film here manages to have some still dazzling special effects, characters you really do care about and there's certainly a terrific cast to help pull it all together.The key to any disaster film is the right disaster. What makes the film work so well here is that everyone has been in a tall building and I'm sure somewhere in the back of their mind they've wondered what would happen if there was a disaster that struck below and you were stuck. Of course, since this movie was released there was 9/11 where the horrors of this story have an added dread to them. The special effects are certainly the greatest thing here as even after forty plus years they're still quite impressive and believable. Director John Guillermin does a great job at putting you right there in danger so the tension level is high throughout and especially once people are facing their deaths. There are some pretty dramatic rescue scenes here and right till the very end the screenplay allows characters to be killed off so you're always on a heightened awareness that something bad can happen at any moment.Another strong point are the performances from the wonderful cast. McQueen easily takes command of the film and the strongest of the actor really makes you believe him in the part. McQueen, the definition of coolness, really does a commanding job here and you believe that he could really be someone to try and rescue all these people. Newman is also very good in his role as the man who tries to rise up because of the guilt he has. Holden also gets several very good scenes here and manages to pull this part off without a problem. Fred Astaire is excellent in his bit of a con man. Faye Dunaway is pretty much wasted as Newman's love interest. Other cast members include Susan Blakely, O.J. Simpson, Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Richard Chamberland and Jennifer Jones.THE TOWERING INFERNO runs a bit long at 165-minutes but everything you'd want in a disaster picture is here and in high quality. Again, this genre eventually got watered down and ruined by some pretty bad pictures but this here is certainly in a league of its own and with the dazzling special effects and the terrific cast, it's entertainment at its highest.

No remake of it to be seen, though sadly I think it is only a matter of time as Hollywood looks to have run out of ideas and become scared of anything that is the least bit original. This one was good, the main stars are Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. There are lots of other stars in this one, but most of them really feel more like cameo appearances or stock characters that matter little when compared to the main two. Though even they are a bit overshadowed by the tall building on fire. The effects are rather good, especially noting the time this film was made, the story is a bit thin, just enough to get you to one cool fire death to a cool fire rescue. It moves alright, but it has its slow stretches in it when compared to The Poseidon Adventure which moved at a lot quicker pace and just never seem to bog down like this film does. McQueen plays a firefighter in this one and does not appear for a while in the picture, but I say he made more of an impact than Newman who was good, but an architect just is not as interesting a character as a firefighter. The ending was okay, not super spectacular, but not exactly disappointing either. In the end this tower soars above almost over all the other disaster flicks of this era, however the Poseidon sinks it and to me is the best.

Whereas in The Poseidon Adventure the leads had to travel up, the only way is down for Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, Robert Wagner and Faye Dunaway. Attending the opening night gala the guests are trapped on the 129th floor of the world's tallest building which becomes an inferno thanks to the shoddy wiring system installed by chief builder James Duncan (Holden) and his electrician son Roger Simmons (Chamberlain). Newman plays Doug Roberts, the proud architect behind the Glass Tower, a skyscraper, which dominates the San Francisco skyline at a height of 138-story's. Returning from a long vacation Roberts immediately recognizes that something is wrong and he is proved correct when a circuit breaker burns out and ignites garbage on a lower floor. While the script can be a tad melodramatic at times, the effort put into this movie is obvious. Nominated for Best Picture and winning for best cinematography, best special effects and best song, the movie was a smash hit and still holds up well today in this age of blockbuster special effects extravaganza's. As with The Poseidon Adventure the previous DVD release was sorely lacking in special features and has been replaced with three hours of extras. Joining the nine all-new featurettes which includes a retrospective, a look at the special effects and the art design is the AMC Backstory on the making of the movie, 32 deleted or extended scenes and an audio commentary by film historian F.X. Feeney. Feeney's commentary is fascinating and comprehensive, covering all aspects of the production from the writing and dialogue all the way through to the sets and the sense of anticipation director John Guillerman builds up from the start. Feeney tells us that this movie was a milestone for Hollywood in that it was the first time two studios had co-produced a feature. Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox owned two separate books, The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson, and both planned to make two competing movies on the same subject. It was Allen who stepped in and proposed the historic deal and the two studios agreed, splitting first the cost and then the profit equally. Though not for the full length of the feature special effects director Mike Venzina and stunt coordinator Branko Racki both individually comment on individual scenes. Verzina discusses eight scenes and Racki talks about nine separate scenes. Their observations are largely technical in nature and center on their selective specialties. The longest of the documentaries is once again the AMC Backstory which runs 2208. It is in this featurette that we learn that the model used for shots of the tower was itself seven stories high, that William Holden became aggravated with Faye Dunaway's tardy-ness to the set and that despite the media attempting to portray conflict between the two stars Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, the two actually got along well together with a mutual respect and friendly competition (as evidenced by a funny blooper). The other featurettes range from 428 in length (on the directing of the movie) to 915 on the writer Stirling Silliphant. But they cover a wide range of topics from a retrospective by the cast and crew Inside the Tower We Remember (816) in which Richard Chamberlain likens the set to being at a really glamorous Hollywood party day after day with the standard six star dressing rooms being increased to 15 to the architecture of the tower in Still the World's Tallest Tower (828) which compares The Glass Tower to other real-life skyscrapers and the impact these high-rise buildings have on the surrounding communities. Other topics touched on include the safety aspects employed on the production in Putting out fire (458) in which Allen comments You'd better have all the camera's rolling because fire waits for no man, and also reveals that firemen were on the set each day to Running on fire (552) which discusses the work of the stuntmen and includes the facts McQueen did not like anyone else doing his stunts and even Newman and Chamberlain did a number of their own stunts. Also on this special collector's edition are 32 deleted or extended scenes that range from the 40-second Still Waiting for the Elevator which featuresshots of crowds of people pushing and shoving each other at the elevator and Holden's character assessing the situation on the telephone to the 255 clip Four Alarm Fire which covers the spreading of the fire through the building, the call from security requesting a four-alarm fire and shots of fire engines screaming through the streets of San Francisco. All of the deleted or extended scenes were originally part of a longer television broadcast. Unfortunately their condition has deteriorated and they were deemed of too poor quality for Fox to include them through the popular DVD technique of seamless branching alongside the theatrical cut on the first disc. Rounding out the special features on this release are three 1975 articles from American Cinematographer which run for a combined 83 pages and which, like those on The Poseidon Adventure DVD release, include selectable images which take the viewer to image galleries. These articles are all technical in nature and include discussion on how the movie was photographed and the work of the action unit. There are also six storyboard comparisons and five image galleries that range from shot compositions and costumes through to publicity and conceptual sketches.

McQueen, Newman, Holden, and Dunaway lead a star-studded cast, one of the most impressive ever assembled. Guillermin and Allen, who directed the action sequences, are to be applauded for keeping the action moving and the tension building despite the length of nearly three hours.

I agree the some 40 years later the film is still very effective. Led by Newman and McQueen and backed up by pros Holden, Astaire, Dunaway, Wagner, Vaughn, Newman and Jennifer Jones you can't lose. The acting is better than most films of the genre. As for the effects, they're as good or better than most CGI efforts. The score is pretty good, the cinematography excellent and the art direction still looks terrific. I love the ambiance of the ill-fated hotel and it doesn't look dated. I have to admit the script is probably its weakest facet. It made the film ripe for satirists to prey on as do most disaster films. SCTV did a hilarious spoof of it, with an even taller skyscraper that swayed in the wind. Joe Flaherty played the unscrupulous owner who cut corners in the construction. He leaves the top floor to escape the inferno, trips and stumbles down the steps. Between scenes they cut to him still falling, until he hits the Main floor. Getting back to The Towering Inferno, some lines that strike me funny are firemen peering at the elevator shaft, when a fireman en-flamed goes speeding down the shaft. The fire chief says, That was one of my men! Another scene that isn't meant to be funny is when Robert Wagner, seeing the desperate situation they're in with flames licking them, says, I used to run the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds flat! and then he runs out with a wet towel on his head and doesn't get more than 6 yards before he's roasted. I couldn't help feeling sorry for Holden, as his character was partly responsible for the whole mess. It is a truly great film. As for Second & Third Place for disaster films Poseidon Adventure in 2nd and Airport in 3rd. The latter because it started the disaster film trend and because I was an extra in it.

I remember when this movie came on ABC (I think) in the 1974 or 1975. There were always commercials featuring the tower burning. The movie was considered long for those days, and broken up into two nights. I was annoyed by Backdraft, because the fire fighters were prancing around burning buildings like they were on vacation in the Riviera. Did anyone who was behind Backdraft realize that the firefighers would have perished very quickly in these burning buildings? I think not. However, I truly believe that, because both the LA and SF fire departments were involved in the movie, they made absolutely sure the movie stayed real.Like in real life, immediately people started suffering from smoke inhalation. Robert Wagner's character thought because he could once do a 10 second 100 yards, that he would make it to safety. His character was wrong. When they broke the windows on the 135 floor, it was very realistic. Like in real life, the place became extremely windy. That's real.I have never seen a TV movie with this cast of characters - ranging from Paul Newman to Fred Astaire. That never happened again in a TV movie. Steve McQueen supposedly balked at the architect role, and insisted on being the fireman. Therefore, it may have been McQueen's last great role. For the last few years of his life, he never appeared in anything very significant again.The movie was a sappy, sophomoric TV movie. I prefer Poseidon's Adventure as the best adventure movie of the 70s. However, there was a lot of depth. Fred Astaire plays an old con artist who finally finds true love. Richard Chamberlain is a nasty, selfish, coward. McQueen and Newman really threw away their star egos on this one to portray the heroism of firefighters. The filming of this movie was stunning. I don't know how they did it. I guess I was most impressed by the realism. Warren Holden was great as an arrogant developer, who only through the realization that he might perish, does he realize you can't cut corners on fire safety. I'd recommend this movie. It gets a little dull at times, but was still an impressive movie in the ways I have highlighted - realism, interesting stories, and the importance of fire safety.

Fred Astaire dancing with Jennifer Jones, Richard Chamberlain being throughly repulsive, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen being every inch the heroes of the hour by the end of the film covered in everything from soot to sweat and still glistening with class.It's also got some tremendously cool wisecracking. How do I get back down....oh s***! It's good for starting fires...He's all smiles...that Goddamn son-in-law of yours...How do you expect her to her a phone call she's deaf! The only thing that slightly mars the film for me is one or two extremely depressing moments such as Susan Flannery's protracted demise which kind of confuse the spirit of the film. Otherwise, a real classic and even before the fire runs riot its wonderful entertainment. It's also the longest film I've never once been bored during.

It works because for the most part the filmmakers cared enough to put a real story into the mix instead of simply just going for the spectacle. Additionally since the fire rages for most of the films three hour running time we are kept on our seats for the entire time unlike other disasters where the event happens mid-film and we spend the second half trying to survive whats just happened.If you can see this on the big screen do so.

The Edifice complex referred to by Paul Newman's Doug Roberts is parodied by the Glass Tower, a 137-story phallic erection in downtown San Francisco, berg par excellence of unbridled phallicism. The fire corresponds to male sexual desire, the central utility duct to the urethra, and the final explosions to male orgasm and ejaculation. What could be more obvious? All the women in this film are secondary, and toward the end they disappear completely. The men treat them as well-behaved children. They share no confidences with them and, once the fire starts, advise them to stay put until they say otherwise. Doug Roberts even deputizes a 10-year-old boy to look after not only his younger sister but a 50-year old woman as well (These ladies are your responsibility now.)!Perhaps if we lived in a matriarchy, buildings would be wide rather than tall, with a central inner sanctum protected by outer rings of rooms separated by interior gardens and canals. Size would be less of an issue than the quality of the decor. Men would grow crops, take care of animals and, yes, learn how to bring women to a complete orgasm. Women would set policy in a less contentious way than we see in modern governments.I have seen this film about 30 times, not only because it is exciting but because it shows up us he-men for the blind fools we so often are. Even the courageous firemen are, in the final analysis, correcting the idiotic mistakes of other men. The fact that women like Liselotte Mueller (played by Jennifer Jones) can love men at all (despite seeing clear through them) is testimony enough to their innate superiority. We men come from Eve's rib!

They were the tallest buildings of their cities by the way.Using the scenic lifts for scale, one can see that the floor plates were a tad on the small side, especially when you take away the spaces for the stairwells, service conduits and elevators and whatever structural system is holding this up - and remember that this was going up in an earthquake zone.At least this building was a mixed-use design with residential units above the 80th or so floor which reduces the need for lifts on the upper floors and there are wider floor plates in the office section but it's a safe bet that the tenant base would be small high-profile firms that can justify the high rents and not some insurance company or brokerage house needing an hectare or two of floor-plate. And that's not a bad thing.However going cheap on the electrical grid is.No... Really...Computers were just starting to make their way down the food chain to the point where just about everyone with 10 grand to spare was getting a mini-frame.

Mainly it has an all star cast which does well without a lot of good script to work with. Irwin Allen's Special Effects were what put people in the theater. Allen's reputation had been established on television in the series VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THE TIME TUNNEL & LOST IN SPACE and then he had done the POSEIDON ADVENTURE prior to doing this film. The prior projects cemented his reputation for doing great special effects & this film does not hurt that reputation. The problem with the film is a hokey script arrived at by melding together two novels - THE TOWER & THE GLASS INFERNO into 1 script. Maybe one novel should have been used & the movie shortened. Paul Newman & Steve McQueen both do well in this as the Architect & the Fire Chief. William Holden does well as the builder. Fred Astaire stands out in a supporting role. O J Simpson even does fine. The thing is in melding the scripts, the writers came up with a hokey Hollywood ending where a million gallons of water are somehow stored at the top of the building & the tank is burst to put out the fire. They would have been better off to have had an all-star barbecue but I guess they couldn't find enough volunteers to get burnt. I think time passing has made this particular film start showing it's age. This film is one of the first & earliest efforts by modern films to address fire safety in a film. That fact has become obscured over the years.My favorite quote in the film is Steve McQueen's reaction when they tell him he has to go up to the top of the tower late in the film to blow the water tanks. So some dumb sob has got to go up there & ....oh sh--!. One of the Brady Bunch Kids, Mike Lookinland even has a role in this film. For all it's star power though, it was Allen's special effects that got folks into the seats- on the big screen it is like being in a real fire- the fire is the biggest star.

As soon as fire breaks out we know we are going to be in for star-studded fun and escapism (in reality the situation would be far grimmer, with far more casualties that we see here).As the trend for star power continued we got to see Steve McQueen as a fire chief, Paul Newman as a rescuer (was he something to do with electrics?), William Holden, Robert Vaughn and others as the suits on the top deck, Richard Chamberlain as the cost-cutting architect, and Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Wagner and Faye Dunaway amongst the guests.

But that's damning with faint praise. We've got Earthquake and Poseidon Adventure. Earthquake is just bad - Charlton Heston is the worst of the big-budget disaster actor-leads. Cruddy subplots, Marjoe Gortner as a sex-crazed National Guardsman, Walter Matthau embarrassing himself, and Victoria Principal in the worst 'fro in screen history. Poseidon - Gene Hackman in one of the worst portrayals of a man of the cloth in screen history, Eric Shea (arrgh), and Shelley Winter's death scene.So Inferno is a classic by compare. Steve McQueen remains pretty much unscathed, Paul Newman seems only mildly embarrassed (what blackmail material did Irwin Allen have on him? - Paul ended up in Krakatoa, East of Java too), and Fred Astaire is charming. On the other hand, Robert Wagner gets the most embarrassing death in scene history (I ran the 100 meter in college - *snap crackle pop*) after trying to hide from a fire. Be very very quiet - maybe it won't find us. And Richard Chamberlain is inexplicably made up to look like an Auton (that's for you Doctor Who fans). Sadly, the likes of Faye Dunaway and William Windom are reduced to non-entities, and O.J. remains a non-entity. And cripes, how many shots can Irwin Allen put his wife Sheila into? There's some shoddy blue-screening - usually in the mid-shots - the longer shots look okay but watch when Robert Vaughn and party go up the elevator, or McQueen holds on to the firefighter on the elevator. But the fire F/X sequences are good and there's decent miniature work. The plot is kinda non-linear - people wander in and out of the penthouse and you kinda lose track of how the firemen get in there, and Chamberlain leaves and comes back, and Newman and Mike Lookinland (who never says his dad is a better architect - one for you Brady Bunch fans) get up there. The setting has some potential for both claustrophobia and expanded outdoor/height stuff (unlike Poseidon Adventure) but sometimes it's a bit too open. Overall it's pretty good though - watchable, at least, and it holds up fairly well unlike the other two big 70's disaster flicks.

What was fascinating, even then, was to see Steve McQueen turn up about 40 minutes into the film and essentially blow Paul Newman off the screen.  Newman was thinner and in better shape than McQueen, but McQueen had machocharisma to burn, and his fire chief character spends much of the movie ordering Newman (the architect whose building is burning) around.The all-star Towering Inferno cast consisted of mini-reunions of casts from other famous films   Faye Dunaway, Paul Newman's love in this movie, had been McQueen's love in The Thomas Crown Affair.

I'm sure these people who are making these comments watched the movie in the 90's and NOT in the 70's when it was suppose to be watched. This movie was a pure winner when I talk it in the 70's. I was only like 12 years old at that time, but I was amazed by all the cool fire effects and all the stars that were in it. I thought the plot was decent enough since the 70's were nothing, but disaster films. The script was kind of cheesy, but you expected that back then. Of course if I saw this movie now I probably wouldn't be too thrilled with it. After being spoiled by movies like Star Wars, Titanic, The Mummy, The Matrix, The Truman Show, etc... people believe that ALL movies, even the older ones, should live up to their expectation. Sorry, but that's not going to happen. The Towering Inferno was a great movie for it's time and the only other movie that even came close was The Posedon Adventure.

I don't rate it as highly as some.","Date":"23 December 2009","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The Towering Inferno is set in San Francisco where the tallest skyscraper in the world called the Glass Tower has been built, however with the project running wildly over budget several compromises had to be made including the electrical wiring & systems which just aren't up to the task. In fact the fuse boxes are prone to overheating & when one does in a small utility room on the 83rd floor it starts a fire which quickly spreads & soon becomes uncontrollable. Unfortunately up on the 135th floor the buildings owner Jim Duncan (William Holden) is holding a star studded opening ceremony party that includes senators (Robert Vaughn), the mayor (Jack Collins & his fat wife & film stars too as guests, Duncan learns of the fire but doesn't want any bad publicity so ignores the warnings but the party guests soon become trapped as the fire rages on below them, it's up to the buildings architect Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) & fire Chief Michael O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen) to outwit the fire & save anyone still trapped inside the skyscraper before they burn to death...This two & three quarter hour epic was directed by John Guillermin & producer Irwin Allen who is credited with directing the 'action sequences' & I see a lot of nine & ten out of ten ratings for it but on a personal level I don't think it's worth anywhere near that generous a score & would put it down closer to a solid six out of ten since it's not a bad film but I didn't love it like so many seem to. The script was actually based on two novels, 'The Tower' & 'The Glass Inferno' with the cool dramatic sounding title obviously a combination of the two & by all accounts (I haven't read either novel) the film itself is a straight combination of the two novels as well with various character's from both (seven from each apparently) & a climax that uses elements from the endings of both books too (the lifeline rescue to another rooftop from The Tower & the exploding water tanks from The Glass Inferno). I suppose one can & indeed has to compare The Towering Inferno to The Poseidon Adventure (1972) & with good reason as the two are basically the same thematically with some sort of disaster trapping people inside something man made & their attempts to escape, personally I think The Poseidon Adventure is a much better film all round as the threat here in The Towering Inferno just felt quite removed from the character's, sure there's a fire going on but most of the people here just stand around until the very last second, there various shots of firefighters fighting the fire & one or two surprisingly slow paced & rather drab set-pieces like the stairway collapsing & Newman having to save a woman & her two kids. Like the Poseidon Adventure there are various character's who we follow with none of them being particularly interesting or likable, the dialogue is alright & it's a decent enough disaster film but at nearly three hours, a slow pace at times & a repetitive story I will stop by saying while I definitely liked The Towering Inferno I didn't love it.There are plenty of fiery effects here & the effects are generally very good, the model work is fine too. I can't believe that chair thing thing attached to the lifeline at the end didn't even have a harness on it & why was the lifeline rope? Why not the much more stronger & fire resistant wire cable? Also McQueen would never have been able to get directly above that scenic lift, it would be impossible hanging directly down from a helicopter as for the helicopter to fly directly above it & dangled McQueen in the right place the rotors would have hit the side of the building. There are a few mild swear words & various people are seen on fire but it's a fairly tame film overall & suitable for family viewing on a wet Sunday afternoon when you want to pass three hours. After the giant success of The Poseidon Adventure disaster films were all the rage so Warner Bros. brought the rights to The Tower while shortly after Twentith Century Fox brought up The Glass Inferno & not wanting two competing films of a similar nature competing at the box-office at the same time they decided to make the film together & The Towering Inferno was in fact the ever joint production between two big Hollywood studios.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 no expense was spared & the dated 70's interiors, wallpapers, giant bleeping computers & fashions are quite quaint & give the film a certain cheesy charm. The acting is OK but I was never that moved, one thing The Towering Inferno doe shave going for it is the cast list which is impressive & includes Steven McQueen, Paul Newman, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, Faye Dunaway, Robert Wagner & O. J. Simpson of all people who manages to save a cat before disappearing for over an hour & a half.The Towering Inferno is a very long film that at times felt like it it was going on for hours & personally I just prefer the situation of The Poseidon Adventure much more. The Towering Inferno ain't bad & it's influenced a whole generation of films since but I doubt I would want to see it again.

It is said to be the more elaborate of the Irwin Allan's disaster creations, as well as the most popular of its kind. The Towering Inferno also entered a new era of film making history. Both Warner Brothers and Twentieth Century Fox had purchased the rights to create a disaster movie based on similar novels involving large, burning buildings - The Tower and The Glass Inferno. Rather than compete for box office receipts by releasing the same type of movie, Warners and Fox joined forces in the first collaboration of two major motion picture studios. Expenses were shared, allowing for a bigger budget of $14,000,000 &#150; an amount unheard of in 1974.The story Architect Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) returns to San Francisco after a 2 year stay in the country. He is returning for the dedication of the glass tower he designed for property developer, James Duncan (William Holden). Having fallen in love with the country during his stay, he makes plans to relocate there after the dedication. The only problem he has is persuading his magazine editor fiancée, Susan (Faye Dunaway) to join him. A large celebration on the 135th floor of the building has been arranged by Duncan and PR man Dan Bigelow (Robert Wagner). Among the invitees are; Senator Parker (Robert Vaughan), the Mayor (Jack Collins) and his wife.During Doug's passionate reunion with Susan (the bright orange silk bed sheets and brown shag carpet remind us which decade we are in - yuck), testing on the building's electrical system turns horribly wrong. On investigation, Doug realises that his electrical specifications have been altered. When challenging the electrical contractor, and son-in-law of James Duncan, Roger Simmons, (the delightfully sleazy Richard Chamberlain), Doug learns that budget cuts prompted Duncan to take short cuts in the quality of building materials. Little does everyone know that a small fire has broken out in a storage room on the 81st floor. By the time the fire is discovered, it has engulfed the entire room. When it starts to spread, Doug tries to convince Duncan to move the party to the lobby. Duncan initially refuses; it wouldn't be good publicity with so many important people at the dedication. By the time Duncan realises the seriousness of the situation and the danger, it is too late. The fire is out of control and there is no way to get everyone down. From there, it is a race against time. With fire safety equipment malfunctioning, it is up to Fire Chief O'Halloran (Steve McQueen) and Doug to try and stop the fire and rescue the people trapped on the 138th floor. Watch out for small cameos by Paul Newman's son, Scott, as a young fire-fighter and Dabney Coleman.For Newman, McQueen, Holden and Dunaway, it was a case of basically sleep walking through their roles. None are at their best, but are still fantastic. I must say, however, I was disappointed with the limited amount of screen time Faye Dunaway receives her acting ability deserved so much more than the token love interest. Richard Chamberlain was wonderful as the sneaky and bitter villain. He gave the best performance of the star studded cast. The same can be said for Robert Vaughan, a severely underrated actor who doesn't receive the respect he deserves.I won't give away who dies and who doesn't. But it is fairly obvious that McQueen, Newman and Dunaway survive. That is all I will say.Summary The Towering Inferno is perhaps the biggest gathering of cinema draw cards that will ever grace a single motion picture. It was also a box office phenomenon. Fierce rivals in Steve McQueen and Paul Newman coming together on the big screen for the first time was enough in itself to motivate the movie-going public to walk into cinemas in their droves. Having so many genuine superstars together in a disaster movie, is something we will most likely never see again.The screenplay is the part of the movie that isn't all that fantastic. It is the epitome of corny and a real let down. It doesn't allow for much character development. Whilst the main attraction is the disaster itself, the screenplay didn't have to be as poorly written as it was, especially for the number of talented actors involved.The stunt and action sequences were magnificent, and for its time, the special effects haven't aged dramatically. In fact, they are more realistic than some of today's disaster blockbusters!! Amazingly enough, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman were allowed to do their own stunt work at their insistence.The music composition is highly underrated. The opening theme to the movie is quite magnificent. The movie opens with Doug's return helicopter flight to San Francisco from Mendocino. The mountains of Northern California were used, and the end result is incredible. The scenery is beautiful and creates an inspiring opening piece. But this is typical of a wonderful composer such as John Williams.The Towering Inferno will remain one of the last true disaster movies that never fail to interest and thrill its audience. Even today, it is still the most popular and talked about disaster movie. This is quite an achievement with the continual technological special effects development and much larger budgets of today's movies.The Towering Inferno is one of my favourites. In my opinion, it blows movies like Volcano, Dante's Peake etc, out of the water. It is the perfect movie to watch with mates where you can have some fun laughing at the corny décor, fashion and dialog. But most importantly, marvel at some of the big screen's most influential actors, strutting their stuff in the last genuine disaster thriller. It will forever remain a loved film icon.

Not only were these movies extravaganza's they sometimes had little gimmicks to go along with them. Kind of like the old smell-o-vision gimmicks. If I remember correctly Earthquake had something that made it feel like the movie theater was shaking, Rollarcoster had something to make you feel you were actually on a Rollarcoster. Airplane of course was the first of these type of disaster movies and Earthquake was the grandest but after all of these years Towering Inferno is the one that holds up the best. Airplane really fell apart because of all of the crazy sequels. One actually had the George Kennedy character who started off as a airplane grounds worker as a Pilot! THen there was the Airplane/Posiden one where the airplane actually fell into the water. The Posiden Adventure was good when it came out but it was not that exciting after the first half. The usual battle of wills and the obligatory young kid who holds the solution. Then the sequel. It goes on. But the Towering Inferno was really scary to me. I hear that dying in a fire is the worst way to go. The scene where Susan Flannery and Robert Wagner see a fire is right at their door is scary. THe phones are down and eventually both die with nowhere to go. Then we have the basis of the movie IMHO that buildings are being built too tall. In the late 70's I worked in the World Trade Center for a summer. I will go on record and say they were always a eyesore to me. Two very ugly monoliths in downtown Manhattan which is a very nice old area of the city. In any case I worked on one of the middle floors. I hated it. I previously seen the Towering Inferno and was affected by the what happened in the movie. People were not going to get out of that building no matter what. One of my good friends actually turned down a big job in 1995 because the offices were up too high and she had saw the movie and it affected her too..all those years later. Turned out to have saved her life. Because it was for that company Marsh which most of the employees died! People complain about not too much development of the characters in the movie. I say that is fine. I was sick of seeing Charlton Heston involved with some women 40 years too young for him while he is cheating on his wife. Or Dean Martin involved with some stewardess. Even Pilot George Kennedy love life. I didn't care if any of them died. Those disaster movies was all about the disaster and the sound effects not the characters. What about Ava Gardner playing Lorene Greens daughter in Earthquake! We weren't suppose to care about those folks. It was just stunt casting where a lot of actors could pick up a paycheck for a few days work. And in the 70's the movie goers understood that. But in Towering Inferno we have 2 popular actors in their prime in main roles. Cool Paul Newman and cooler Steve McQueen. Unlike Airlplane and Earthquake in which well known actors were in the lead but they were way past their heyday. Then you have Wiliam Holden who even though was a older actor was in a renewal of his career with Network plus he was having a big love affair with Stephanie Powers at the time and Faye Dunaway was a major actress. Newman is the architect of the building and McQueen the firefighter. You also have Richard Chamberlin playing the villain who cut costs in making the building. He was excellent and over the top like a true villain should be. The fire was terrifying and it continued until the very end of the movie. Unlike Earthquake which only takes place for a few minutes..the rest of the movie is about foolishness like Victoria Principle being attacked by a maniac. Walter Mattheu sitting in a bar and Charlton looking for his girlfriend. In Towering Inferno the danger was always right there with nowhere to go. Yes it does have the obligatory scene with the 2 children in peril but it is not a big plot device. Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire actually have a few lines and we see him dancing a little. I did care about what happened to him and Jennifer Jones because the writers of the movie realized since the movie was about putting out a fire and people being trapped they should give these folks who have to sit around a story. Plus Jones plays a heroic character. I cared about what happened to Paul Newman because he was a good guy who was stabbed on the back by Richard Chamberlin and I cared about William Holden who I thought was a bad guy until he found out that the building was really a fire trap caused by his good old son in law. And I cared about Steve McQueen because he putting his life in danger to save people and he was not there just as a prop but in the whole movie. To me the stunt casting was done with the lesser known like OJ Simpson. Even he was OK. The solution was a simple one where I wondered why they hadn't thought of it before. But it was exciting because it involved detonating something and having 3 minutes to get out of a burning room. I am not going to say what happens but it will have you at the edge of your seats. This was the crown jewel of the 70's disaster movies .

It had owned the crown as the best disaster film of all-time until James Cameron's Titantic took that honor when it came out 23 years later. Irwin Allen had already one hit disaster epic under his belt (1972's The Poseidon Adventure), and he topped himself with The Towering Inferno. This movie, like Titanic, was distributed by two studios (20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.), and I think this was the first movie to have co-distributors. The Towering Inferno is about the tallest skyscraper in the world that starts burning out of control after bad wiring causes a flare-up in a storage room. I was scared to death when I watched this film the first couple of times on TV when I was a kid. It doesn't scare me today, but now I find the movie exciting, suspenseful, and mind-boggling. Like The Poseidon Adventure, Allen got a big name cast to participate in the film. Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, and O.J. Simpson star, with early film appearances by Dabney Coleman (of 9 to 5 and TV's Buffalo Bill) and Susan Flannery (recent Best Actress Daytime Emmy winner for the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful). Big time actors, but like most disaster movies, the big star here is the special effects. Very impressive. The cinematography and editing (which won Oscars) play a big part in the film as well. The only thing that can be considered negative about The Towering Inferno is the script. Like all of Irwin Allen's disaster films (as well as disaster films not produced by Allen), this one has its share of idiotic dialogue. Usually a movie that has this element bothers me like it did in the disaster films of the late '70s. But I didn't let that bother me this time. The action scenes and special effects work so well, along with some good performances (particularly by Astaire and Jones), that it makes The Towering Inferno a must-see.**** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"One of the greatest disaster movies ever.","Date":"14 January 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  The cast is great, especially McQueen.

Naturally the wiring is not up to standards and a fire starts on the 81st floor. And it happens on the opening night when there's a huge party on the top floor. And we get to see an all star cast deal with this.OK--let's deal with the plot. A 138 story building? OK I can buy that, but in San Francisco???? New York maybe but California? I don't think so. Also the film starts by saying it's dedicated to fire fighters the world over. Uh huh. What bull! This is just a big, dumb, loud but fun escapist movie. I like it, but I think it's only dedicated to killing people off as ingeniously as possible. Still it's all fake so it's hard to take seriously. The characters are all one dimensional and the situations and dialogue are SO clichéd I actually broke out laughing a few times! Also the film has plot loopholes galore and some really questionable logic. I LOVE how they put the fire out!The acting is mostly rotten but really--these people have NOTHING to work with. Steve McQueen is The Fire Chief and he's just terrible. Paul Newman is The Architect--he's actually very good. William Holden is The Builder and looks just miserable (he supposedly hated this movie).

Susan Blakely is The Wife--see Faye Dunaway. Richard Chamberlain is The Son-In-Law--the poor guy tries but can't pull his role off. Jennifer Jones is The Widow--miscast and horribly treated. O.J. Simpson is The Security Man--he saves a cat. Wow. Robert Vaughn is The Senator--poor guy has zero to work with. Robert Wagner is The Publicity Man--he's hardly in this enough to matter. Also the late Scott Newman (Paul Newman's son) plays a young fireman. He's actually very good. It's too bad he took his own life in 1978.So the film is stupid and dumb but the special effects are still quite good and I was never bored even though the film runs 2 hours and 45 minutes. A great disaster film. Turn off your brain and enjoy! I give it a 9.

You could close your eyes through this one and still be able to follow the plot. A San Francisco skyscraper catches fire on its unveiling, and there's plenty of stock characters on hand more than willing to go up in flames. The picture is so empty of humanity that characters we barely get a chance to know are given big, fiery send-offs--and for what purpose? Poseidon worked because it had a handful of characters, cartoonish but three-dimensional nonetheless, whom we came to care about. Inferno doesn't have many interesting people in it, not architect Paul Newman, fireman Steve McQueen, girlfriend Faye Dunaway, honcho William Holden, con-man Fred Astaire, or even the Shelley Winters lookalike in the pink dress. Astaire got an Oscar nomination for his work, but there's little evidence that he was around for much of the filming (it's an extended cameo, for prestige). The film was nominated for Best Picture, which might have been another gesture of good will since two competing movie studios jointly financed it and Hollywood loves a happy ending with big bucks involved. ** from **** "},{"Title":"GET OUT OF THE DAMN BUILDING!","Date":"18 July 1999","Score":"4 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Get out of the damn building already!

It sort of makes sense now too why they were all dressed in Ronald Weasley's dress robes...Apart from the endless staring at each other they also made sure there were lengthy pauses after each corny and unnatural sounding sentence they uttered. Even in the middle of a life-threatening emergency. They were either all terribly zen or...retarded. Yeah. I think this is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen. About 65% of it, at least, could and should have been cut easily. I hope they remake it with normal people.

A star-studded cast are sent to a party at the top of a newly opened highest building in the world only to be subject to a fire started fifty stories below them in a maintenance room. Of course, initially, they figured the building could withstand this minor blaze, but we find out they cut corners on the building to lessen the cost and pad their pocketbooks making it eventually an inferno spreading wildly. You can guess how the picture is going to go, you just don't know how the flame will be burned out, and who is going to survive. This mystery didn't keep me interested, and I personally don't think it's entertainment to watch people burn up and dive thru glass windows to their death every few minutes. These type of movies were popular in the 70's so there must have been an audience for them because there was enough of them, but they are not my cup of tea. There is a common theme in a lot of my reviews about whether you care for the people in the movie and unfortunately very little information is given to allow for this in this one. The acting is fine, although there are some classic cliché's that are used for fodder in many latter spoofs of the genre, including a perfectly stoic Steve McQueen, as the hard working fire marshall, and the un-believing William Holden as the builder. Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, and others get their money due to their fame, but don't add much to the picture, in my opinion. O.J. Simpson is actually surprisingly good as a security person for the building despite his lack of acting chops, but no-one else stands out. There are a lot of sets that the actors have to trudge through to try and make the film interesting, with an interesting camera trick for an elevator shaft(that I swear was mimicked in the Star Wars series while Luke looks down into a death star area before dropping). Unfortunately, it was hard for me to get thru this movie not because of the intensity really, but because of the familiarity. I have never been a fan of these Irwin Allen productions, although I'm sure he made a lot of money and this one was even nominated for an Academy Award for Best picture although only won in the technical areas. Good for him, but I don't consider this film that noteworthy.

If you pay attention there is no smoke (on the outside shots) yet the building is burning! In the Long Shots we should see a big column of thick black smoke, yet we only see the beautiful SF Skyline and the mat shot of the building in flames..I guess that The Master of Disaster Irwin Allen, was more concern with saving money than paying attention to details such as that.He was well known for being frugal in his productions, even though he always started his productions with the highest levels of detail like Lost In Space for instance, that show had all the elements to be turned into a magnificent peace of TV, even a full size mock up Of the Jupiter2, yet it was only used briefly 2 during the 3 years of The Show, What a waste of resources!!Anyways I love IA and all his work!

Towering Inferno proved once again that more money and bigger stars don't always account for much when it comes to good film-making. Irwin Allen tried a little too hard to duplicate the extraordinary and well deserved success and praise he had with Poseidon. Unfortunately the result is an overblown big-budget bore.**SPOILER AHEAD** The most shameless Poseidon rip-off comes near the end of the already too long movie with the idea of lets trash another beautiful room (hosting a gala event) with as much fire, water, and death as possible. It's The Poseidon Adventure all over again, just 135 floors up this time. And how was Mr. Allen going to duplicate the excitement of the sea flooding the Poseidon into a landlocked skyscraper? By blowing up zillion-gallon capacity water tanks on the roof of course! Yet this isn't half as ridiculous as forcing the viewer to believe the world's tallest building (made almost entirely of glass) would have been built on top of the San Andreas Fault.The movie is dedicated to the firefighters of the world and was intended to pay homage to their noble and heroic efforts. Unfortunately it succeeds in doing just the opposite -- continually exhibiting how bumbling, helpless and ineffective they are in a situation like this.The action sequences are few and far between, and many are so long and drawn out that they hardly induce heart-pounding excitement or suspense. Most notably a scene in which Bobby Brady and others try to climb down a mangled staircase for what seems like hours.Towering Inferno is not a terrible disaster flick, but it can't hold a candle (no pun intended) to the true ruler of the disaster genre, The Poseidon Adventure.

Basically in San Francisco the world's tallest building, The Glass Tower, which stands at 138 stories and 1,800 ft high, is holding a celebratory opening gala party on the top floor, with many high profile guests attending, and the architect Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) has arrived for the occasion. While the dedication ceremony is getting ready and the guests and dignitaries are gathering, all the power has been activated to light up the tower, and with this high power being run an electrical fault has occurred in a store room on the 81st floor, and the short has sparked an undetected fire, the technicians have noticed the fault but have no indication of a fire. Soon smoke is seen on the floor, and the fire department are called into action, Fire Chief Mike O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen) orders an evacuation, but building owner James 'Jim' Duncan (William Holden) refuses to do this as he is sure the fire will not spread and he wants the ceremony to continue. In fact the fire has spread throughout the 81st floor, fatally injuring building staff and firefighters, and it is making its way up floor by floor, so he is convinced to move the party to a lower floor, the building's electrical engineer Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain) was sure the building was up to standards for the opening, but he admits to cutting corners. The guests including con artist Harlee Claiborne (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Fred Astaire), who has wooed Lisolette Mueller (Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Jones), U.S. Senator Gary Parker (Robert Vaughn) and Mayor Robert Ramsay (Jack Collins) are trying to help as many people into the elevators as possible, but the cables could easily break in the heat of the flames so they resort to the express elevators. The means of escape are limiting as the inferno spreads throughout the skyscraper, and people inside including Roberts' girlfriend Susan Franklin (Faye Dunaway), public relations chief Dan Bigelow (Robert Wagner) and his mistress and secretary Lorrie (Golden Globe winning Susan Flannery) are getting trapped on the various floor catching fire. Gas explosions occur and staircases collapse, characters manage to climb their way up and down the various passages and shafts to avoid the flames, and O'Hallorhan with the other firefighters are trying their best with the water and evacuation, but their efforts cannot stop the various flammable substances throughout the structure from spreading the fire. By the end of the film, following many characters dying in the burning rooms, the fire reaches the top of the building and near the Prominade Room where most of the guests are still gathered, the fire department decide to explode the water tanks on top of The Glass Tower to extinguish the raging flames, and the million gallons of water spill down the ignited floors, and the inferno is finally stopped and the remaining guests are rescued. Also starring Susan Blakely as Patty Duncan Simmons, O.J. Simpson as Chief Security Officer Harry Jernigan, Sheila Mathews as Paula Ramsay, Don Gordon as Kappy, Dabney Coleman as Deputy Chief and John Crawford as Callahan. The cast of big names all play their parts well, and part of the fun is guessing and seeing who will bite the dust, but of course the most exciting scenes are of the fire spreading throughout the rooms and causing things to collapse, the suspense and claustrophobia accompanied by the special effects for the fire are most effective, I will admit the film is a bit long, but overall it is an entertaining disaster movie. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Song for We May Never Love Like This Again (it was also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. It was number 39 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!

Basicaly, the picture focuses on watching a totally 70's building burn.  I expected an action packed disaster movie, but what I got was a slow paced disappointment.  The extremely predictable extremely weak story gives no room for mega talent like Steve McQueen or Newman to do their thing.  The special effects come to us from such a nul and void context that they basically stand on their own; during their day that might have been able to carry the picture, but coming in with todays blockbuster standards don't get your hopes up.  If you want a good fire-fighter movie, watch Backdraft.
