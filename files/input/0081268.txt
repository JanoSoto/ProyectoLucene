[{"Title":"A movie with a message for the heart and soul","Date":"7 June 2008","Score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Most movies that use the God word in them have either been epics like Moses or movies where God is not taken serious. In Oh God, Book II George Burns plays the kind of God who comes down to our level to figure out a way to get the human race to take notice of their creator. George Burns character is perfect in the movie as he enlists the assistance of Louanne, a doting, charming young girl who accepts God's appearance on the scene with surprise at first, then with curiosity and finally enthusiasm as he asks her for her assistance in getting more folks to stand up and take notice of God. The plot is simple as one would expect, but the simplistic faith of Louanne, despite her growing predicaments adds more than cute charm to this fun movie, it stirs the heart and soul of anyone who watches with the same innocent faith of the lead child character of Louanne. The moral is simple, the characters mesh well and the end result is a reminder of what we are all here for.

While I can accept that it's not a classic film by any means, Oh God! Book II still has some funny one-liners and a chemistry between the characters that works. George Burns and Louanne did a fine job together. They are really what the movie is about.The story involves Tracey Richard's (Louanne) who's father is involved in advertising. She is approached by God (Burns) who asks her to assist, along with her friends and classmates, to help spread the message that God should be in people's thoughts more often. While the scenario is predictable, her friends accept the idea, the adults in the movie all think she is crazy after telling them about her visits with The Almighty. This leads to such things as Tracy getting expelled from school and an insanity hearing where God shows up to help save the day, and prove to the adults that who Tracy communicated with was not imaginary.I think the critics that bash this film as some sort of religious propaganda take the movie too seriously. This is more of a relax and enjoy the simple chemistry between the immensely talented George Burns and the more intelligent than the adults realize in the movie, Louanne. I believe they had a great time making this film together! One could argue that Tracy's parents, (David Birney and Suzanne Pleshette) exist in superficial roles. However, the focus is strong enough for Burns and Louanne to carry the movie by themselves, and in the opinion of this reviewer, it seems to work. For whatever reason, I am drawn back to watch this film when I see it is on, so it can't be ALL BAD.There are also some edited scenes that I saw once on the broadcast TV versions that aren't available on premium cable and AFAIK the same applies to this footage missing on VHS/DVD releases as well. I do not recall seeing the original theatrical release back in 1980 when it first came out. But here are the edited scenes 1.) When Tracy is looking for God he gives her an ice cream cone in a park. There is another scene where Tracy sees an ice-cream vendor in the park who looks like God. She runs to him and yells out, God! The vendor turns around and says, Hi Sweetie, what flavor? Tracy apologizes to the man and dejectedly walks away. We know that this scene was originally included in the movie because it is mentioned by the psychiatrist Dr. Newall when he is talking to her parents AND by Tracy herself at her insanity hearing. But this scene apparently no longer exists. (At lest not in premium cable and presumably DVD/VHS copies of the film.) 2.) There is another deleted scene with Tracy and God talking about meeting together to work on the campaign slogan. She says, Let's do what my Dad does, have a business lunch. This is also indirectly referenced when Tracy's father tells her that if he were going to sell the high qualities of a person, he would take that person to lunch. The McDonald's scene with Tracy and God remains in all prints to my knowledge, but the conversation with God and she about having a business lunch. also no longer seems to exist.My guess is that these were scenes added for broadcast TV viewing and it would be interesting to see them again. If you have a commercial TV version of this movie, watch for them! It's funny how I can't recall hardly a thing about the first Oh God! movie with John Denver. But, I can't forget this sequel! Listen to Burns' comments about how life can't be created with just one side to it. It is VERY MOVING! The ending is also surprisingly touching.

The question which the little girl asks God (George Burns) in a key scene why bad things happen should be in a FAQ portion of a theology syllabus. His answer, while ultimately unsatisfying, deserves attention. He said that in creating things, he never got the knack of not creating the opposite. You know light vs. dark, joy - sadness, etc. It is an ancient question that has exercised the greatest Doctors of the Church, among them St. Augustine who argued that evil per se does not exist. Called the privatio boni argument, Augustine's contention is that what we perceive as evil is simply the lack of a particular aspect of good. For example, sickness is an evil because of the lack of health of the body. Naturalistic philosophies such as Taoism argue in the same vein - that evil is the result of not being in harmony with nature, with the Yin and Yang, seemingly contending forces or aspects of reality but which could not exist without the other. One would wish that God could explain further but alas! it is just silly old George Burns and his ridiculous cigar.

Here, God appears to a young girl (Louanne, who had earlier starred in a stage production of Annie) and asks her to spread his Divine Word, causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process. Peculiar, family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough, and Burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes, but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness. The adults of the piece actually consider locking little Louanne up, all of which makes God seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend. Louanne is another problem a perky kid with wizened little eyes, she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. The medium-budget production has a gloppy, TV-movie appearance, with few graceful touches. The final scene mimics the climax of the first Oh, God! in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix, which is welcomed. It's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from **** "},{"Title":"An OK film","Date":"28 May 2008","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Hey, it is the kid critic and now I am reviewing Oh God! Book II. This movie is OK, but, while watching it I kept on forgetting that it is a Oh God! Picture. This one is actually more of a kids movie then Book I. in my opinion. I think that in a way the film could have been called Tracy and God. It is not as fresh as Oh God! but it is OK. It is funny but not as funny as Book I. But it does not deserve all of the bad reviews. I think that the people who went to go see this in 1980 were expecting the 39th anniversary of Citizen Kane or the 8th anniversary of The Godfather or the 6th anniversary of The Godfather Part II. In the trailer, God said that Oh God! Book II has just as many laughs as the first one. It does have some laughs but not as much as the first one. Well check this out. Do not expect The Godfather Part 2(which I have never seen) right before you watch this. Well, good luck. My overall rating is 6 out of 10 angels.

Nothing more. If God thinks things on Earth were screwed up in 1980, what would he possibly think now? Are these rising gas prices his way of getting our attention these days? This film is a sequel to film in which God (George Burns) apparently used John Denver to help spread his message. I guess it either didn't work, or so many people were afraid of Denver's singing that they didn't want to tune in and find out. In this film, God picks a young girl named Tracy to come up with a slogan that could get people to think about him once again. Being as her father is in advertising, she would seem to be a good fit. But then why wouldn't God just pick him to do it? Well, you see it's because kids are cuter when they are out spreading a slogan like Think God. In no time Tracy and her friends have plastered or written the message in chalk all over their L.A. neighborhood. Needless to say, the school board types are not amused. And if any kid tried this today.... sheesh! Who would show up to protest first? Probably the ACLU, followed by Michael Moore. Anyway, Tracy's troubles are just getting started.God sure doesn't make this easy on her! Not only is it tough to think of a good slogan, but he also talks to her where others can see. Of course they cannot also see God, so they all think Tracy is talking to herself and losing her mind. Also, her school work suffers. God does at least help her with her math, and he admits he made mathematics too hard. I agree. Tracy is eventually expelled from school, picked apart by doctors, and has her life turned inside out. But she is doing God a favor, so I guess its worth it. There is also a small subplot about Tracy's separated parents reconciling after a few jokes about the big breasts of her father's new girlfriend. The acting is good enough. Burns plays essentially himself which is charming as expected. Louanne, who plays Tracy isn't as annoying as most child actors. The parents are good enough. The film delivers about what you'd expect. Its passable family viewing, but atheists should steer clear. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.

She makes cracks about her father's new love. So what does she do? She goes to God, and she creates Think God. She gets her friends to help her spread the message out. But her parents, think she's out of touch with reality. Even the psychiatrists think the same way. When they committed her to a ward, the children rebel against all the adults in the town. The school was closed by the children, and the principal has his back up against the wall. What does God do? Get her out. The best scene is where he rides the motorcycle with side car. And the police see Tracy in the side car. It's a very good movie to watch. Sending a very powerful message. It was cute at the beginning of the Tonight Show, where Tracy saw God instead of Johnny Carson. There's no such thing as being too young. God will make a way for you. 5 stars!

He asks little Tracy Richards (Louanne) to meet him using Chinese fortune cookies. Her parents Paula (Suzanne Pleshette) and Don (David Birney) are divorced. Only she can hear or see him. She suggests that he should get a slogan. He gives her the job. She and her friend Shingo come up with 'Think God'. They get the other kids to join. Her parents get concerned about her talking to God. School Principal Benson is not happy and suspends her. Her parents bring her to a child psychiatrist and he tells them to institutionalize her. Shingo leads a school demonstration to bring back Tracy.I have a couple of problems with this movie. Whenever an old man lures a young girl away, I always have a Stranger-Danger moment. The fortune cookies bit leaves me a bit cold. Once I get over that, the cute little girl is very compelling. I like most of the movie but then it takes a jab at child psychiatry that is both undeserved and unreasonable. It makes disbelieve to be some kind of evil. The movie itself makes the analogy to childhood imaginary friends. I doubt psychiatrists were locking kids up for imaginary friends even back then. If they could make the case that she was harming herself or other people, that would make a whole lot more sense. This is simply picking a fight with nobody real. There are some good moments in the middle. George Burns is still sharp.

George Burns is well played in his roll as GOD and why not, he,s perfect for the part of GOD. He is a legend that goes back way before these actors. The message is to have faith and believe.

Louanne plays a little girl who is asked by (ahem) God to mount an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again. No really, that is the story, and it's a leaden load of old cobblers that has far too much self-justifying and 'explanatory' waffle but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm. It wants to be a Bible-bashing 'Miracle on 34th Street', but it doesn't come close.Suzanne Pleshette breathes a bit of life into this suffocating puddle of quick-setting concrete but the pudding-headed script and rubbish performance by the irksome Louanne quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of you-know-where.

It's basically about a girl who is told by God to advertise him... so that everyone will be Christian... The whole point of christianity is free will and you can choose to be christian if you want to. If God wanted everyone to be Christian, he would make them be Christian. Anyways, the Prinicipal of the girl's school, who is the antagonist, suspends her. I say she should be suspended. She was putting up signs everywhere with the message Think God. all over the school, and everyone magically became christian, and whenever someone tried to stop the girl because they were of a different faith, they were portrayed as evil crazies. The girl's parents take her to a psychiatrist when she tells them she sees God in restraunts and in her bedroom. Apparently the writer knew about as much about Christianity as they did therapy. The psychiatrist puts the girl through catscans, x-rays, blood tests, lie detector tests, and any other thing you can think of... this is ludicrous. Why would they give her physical tests?! They would just talk to her or something! Anyways, they decide to send her to a nut house because she has an imaginary friend. She runs away and God takes her home on a motorcycle.

People who read the Bible believe in God and accept him and his teachings as a matter of simple Christian Faith. However, the scientists say We need proof that we can put under our microscopes. I think it took a lot of courage for Hollywood to make the Oh God series and I thank them for it. George Burns and John Denver were wonderful in the original. It was one of the first movies that I saw as a kid and I couldn't think of a better one. George took the role of God very seriously, he even consulted with Jimmy Stewart and Orson Welles before he played it can you believe that? He asked them how you would play God (Orson Welles told him I would play him sitting down). This is a wonderful sequel. You might ask why God would come down to earth again, well when he did before he made the studio so much money thats why? A young actress with only one screen name Louanne takes John Denver's place in the film and she does a wonderful job. She was such a good little actress that I always wondered what happened to her. I'll bet she and George had a ball making this film, it shows in the finished product and there is wonderful chemistry between them. It kind of chilled me when they thought the little girl was crazy for talking to God and wanted to put her in an insane asylum. It chilled me and it also made me very angry at a society that is hostile towards religion and God's word. It is almost as if we live in a world that glorifies evil and condemns good. This is a film that is very rare indeed because it is one with a message that makes you think long after the final credits and it is due to George Burn's wonderful performance. This man was an American treasure. What really amazes me is that he didn't act in the traditional sense until he was almost 80 years old and made The Sunshine Boys. As far as I am concerned, all acting students should watch his work in that film and in the Oh God series. They will see a master at work. This is a rare sequel indeed, it is as fine as the original. It will leave you with a sore belly from laughing, but also with a slight lump in your throat.
