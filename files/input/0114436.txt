[{"Title":"A Misunderstood Classic","Date":"9 August 2000","Score":"270 out of 331 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Calling Showgirls poorly acted or sexist completely misses the point; it's like accusing Britney Spears of not being a real musician, as though you've discovered something.Of *course* Showgirls is exploitative and demeaning to women.  Almost all Hollywood movies are demeaning to women.  Almost all of them are male-written, male-directed male fantasies. But most of them cover this fact with a thin veneer of empowerment and sensitivity, making perfunctory, surface concessions to political correctness.  It's hypocritical, dishonest and has horrible long-term effects on the psyches of young impressionable girls (and boys).  The brilliance of Showgirls is that it gathers all of the worst Hollywood masculine excess and throws it unapologetically in our faces. The movie is straight-from-the-id, primal, brutish male fantasy.  Every woman in the movie is a laughable caricature who advances, if at all, by deceiving other women and becoming a sexual object for men.  The heroine, Nomi, crosses every line, sells every shred of dignity, physically assaults her female competitors, sleeps with her boss (in the most over-the-top sex scene in cinematic history), gets her best friend raped... and at the end of the film, claims that she has gambled and won herself. This tragi-comic nod to empowerment is a slap to the face of anyone who's been paying attention.Whether Esterhauz and Verhoeven intended it as such, Showgirls is at once a camp classic and a sly satire, an example of everything our culture at once wallows in and disavows.  Sure, you can react with righteous indignation, waggle your finger at the movie, and pat yourself on the back for being so enlightened.  But maybe you should take a look around, at the billboards, the commercials, the sitcoms, the movies, the music videos, your own prejudices... and think about whether you can't find a better target.

Well, I guess if you take it at face value, it does.However, it's not meant to be taken that way (internally, with a glass of water?), and it's a shame that so many people did. Really, 'Showgirls' is a campy, funny movie. It's a riot. And it's supposed to be.Elizabeth Berkley, in the lead role, plays her part like an actress on one of those day-time soaps - which is probably exactly what Verhoeven wanted. She does everything dramatically. She sits down, dramatically; she takes off her jacket, dramatically; and if you watch closely enough you'll even see her eating fries dramatically.Gina Gershon as femme fatale/lead dancer Cristal gives the best performance of the film. She obviously is in sync with the director and has a lot of fun with the part, and if you only watch it for one reason, watch it for her. Because, in the words of L'Oreal, she's worth it. She's a great talent and it's a shame she's not recognised more widely.Would I recommend it? I don't know. It depends on your taste. If you're looking for a drama, go elsewhere. If you're looking for a quirky, funny movie, and you don't mind lots of naked ladies running around all over the place (yes, even if you're female - I am, and I liked it), go rent it.

When this first came out 10 years ago, it majorly flopped. It was seen as exploitive against women and depraved. Elizabeth Berkley from saved by the bell fame used this movie as her chance to be taken as a serious actress, and she was outcast from acting. I think this movie was made just at the wrong time. It has been ten years and what social satire in '95 was, is very different now. I found this very empowering towards women. It shows just how blind men can be; that women have more power than they actually realize.Elizabeth Berkley does do a very bad job at acting, but there is this charm she has. all the over acting brought some dignity to her character. Gina Gershon as Christal plays the best bitch; very two faced. Kyle MacLachlan looks like he stumbled off the set of Blue velvet, but brought some of Denis hoppers sleaze along with him.Paul Verhoeven directed this bag of sleaze, but like a lot of his movies, there is this mood of depression; showing life at its worse, where it cant get any worse. If you've seen Total Recall, RoboCop and Starship Troopers you'll notice this running theme of his.this does have a bit of a slow burn to it. a lot of the back stabbing doesn't happen till about the hour and half point, but its a great cynical satire till then. there's so many clich√©s in here, but you kinda don't think about them as most of the time your wondering if you just saw what you just SAW. And the one liners are just awesome.This may not be a master piece, its far from it. but this show just how great some bad tasting movies can be the most pleasurable experience.

OK, so it was supposed to be an erotic drama but forget that and sit back and laugh your way through the very best of the worst movies ever made.There wasn't a thing that did not go wrong with this film.

And what about the cast? Madonna, in one of the few wise film choices she made, turned down the role of the leading lady of Las Vegas and Gina Gershon stepped in. Drew Barrymore said no thanks to the role of Nomi, the ambitious dancer who was ready to claw her way to the top, and after they hit up every B, C and D list of actresses they ended up casting Elizabeth Berkley.

It's ten times as good as Striptease.It's not Citizen Kane, but it's not a soft-core porn version of Rock Star (awful film) either. Most of the characters were well-developed and believable, even it the situations were not. And there's plenty of humor, the vast majority of it intentional. I'm wondering if most of the heavy derision of the film comes from Puritanical attitudes, rather than from an honest evaluation. If unromanticized sex and heavy nudity -- literally, in the case of one character -- make you (or your viewing companions) uncomfortable, Showgirls probably not for you.

The opposite can happen as well. Showgirls drew some venomous reviews from both critics and audiences, and it quickly gained a reputation as a bad movie--it became a buzzword and a joke immediately. An entire generation of filmgoers who were too young to see Showgirls (or else uninterested in it) were instructed that it was a bad movie when it was mentioned as such in the all-ages trailer for the big hit Scream 2. More recently, people like Tarantino and a few respected film critics began to admit that they loved the film, and while it's never going to gain acceptance as a serious film, at least people are able to see Showgirls for what it is instead an opinion based on legend.Yes, Showgirls is trashy and absurd, but we do enjoy those kinds of films. Are we saying that it's wrong to make them? I think the main problem with Showgirls is that it's a great looking, big budget film that is a pastiche at heart. Whatever people were expecting at the time of its release, they were definitely not expecting a new Beyond the Vally of the Dolls (which, like Showgirls, got the strongest possible rating at the time of its release). Also similar to Russ Meyer, Verhoeven takes Joe Esztherhas's crazy script and directs his actors to be straight faced at all times, saying these lines as if they mean it. Just like in 1970, this defied the expectations of the audience, and it got the movie panned. Whatever Paul Verhoeven intended with this film, it's hard to imagine that this happened accidentally, and even the people who claim to like Showgirls because it's so bad are missing the point just a little. I think the bizarre qualities of the film are mostly intentional, and it doesn't stray too far in style from successful films Verhoeven made before this, mostly Basic Instinct. In fact, it seems to me that the only true bungling has been MGM's marketing. Even now, as they reap the benefits of it being a cult classic that has sold extremely well on home video, their idea of how to round out the DVD edition is to get somebody totally uninvolved with the film to deliver a sometimes amusing but otherwise unnecessary commentary about the obvious instead of paying Elizabeth Berkley a couple thousand dollars to offer her own commentary on the film, which would have been a couple thousand times better.Eszterhas writes trashy movies intended to be a good time, and Showgirls is certainly that. But I can't imagine Verhoeven thinking that this movie would connect with audiences on a large scale basis; the trailers implied that Showgirls would be similar to Basic Instinct, which it is not. Maybe if this movie had come later, after another failed attempt to recreate Basic Instinct, people might have accepted it as its own type of film. The dialog is way over the top, and how utterly boring would the movie have been otherwise? Other parts of the film are marvelously conceived, and Verhoeven keeps the film in motion at all times. The only thing that truly spoils the fun is a violent rape scene, although it does fit with the reptilian tone of the movie, full of victims and victimizers; it is the one thing that grounds the film in the real world with real violence. It may not have been intentional, but it presents an interesting concept if the rape had happened to any other character, it would not have been the same. Because it happens to the film's only sympathetic character, it carries a great impact. The cinematography is flawless, and the sets are always interesting and sometimes funny (like the bizarre stage numbers). Pay attention to the soundtrack as well, Verhoeven has an excellent collection of songs, many of them written specifically for the film.Watching Elizabeth Berkley's career self-destruct on camera is one of the film's most morbidly fascinating pleasures. I beg to differ with people who call her performance bad; what actress could have played this part and made it anything other than what Berkley did? The truth is, she worked wonders with a character that was impossible to play. Her dancing is both ridiculous and a marvel. How she can bend herself into those positions and hit those marks, not to mention her famous lap dance gyrations, must be seen to be believed. Gina Gershon is great too, a leering predator who manages to be both vulnerable and invincible at the same time, and only because she seems to be the only actor in the troupe that's in on the joke. Kyle McLachlan is skeezy, with a haircut and a smile that make him resemble the creature from the ALIEN franchise more than a human being. You expect an inner jaw to emerge from his mouth at any moment.Showgirls is ridiculous, but to me it's also multifaceted and fascinating, appealing to the cynic in all of us. It fails as an engaging story, but the film itself doesn't fail to engage the viewer at all; you can laugh at it (or with it), and it accomplishes something subversive in the way it makes you consider the filmmakers and actors involved. I think most people just say Showgirls is a bad movie because they've already been told it's a bad movie. I revisit it more often than some of the other films in my collection, and it gets more absurd, funny, gross, and sometimes even beautiful, every time I watch it. Bad movies are boring movies. Showgirls is not.

First of all,I will say it is far more sordid in its depiction of Las Vegas showbusiness backstage than the majority led you to believe. The principal guarantee is that it is directed by Paul Verhoeven, one of the most interesting and personal filmakers nowadays, with frenzy and nerve and that mixture of sex and violence characteristic of his filmography, so there's no doubt this is one of his most personal works for the screen. His perverse look to human desire, impulses and instincts and the direct way he brings it to he screen are something really unique and make him an author rather than a mere director. Talking about Showgirls, the exciting choreographies and its connection with what is being told reveal his love and knowledge of the musical genre. In addition, the script by Eszterhas is a malicious retelling of the Cinderella's tale, manipulative, funny, filled with great dialogue and a sense for rhythm than a lot of screenwriters would like to have.Gina Gershon shines in her role, but I simply can't believe why the critics deceased Elisabeth Berkley when her performance is filled with enthusiasm and energy.  Bear all this in mind, and at least, give it a try! If you know and admire Verhoeven's work, you will sure appreciate Showgirls in its just measure.

The problem with Paul Verhoeven is that nobody realises that he's a satirist. All his films shot outside of the Netherlands are intensely satirical and not meant to be taken at face value. With Showgirls he quotes from All about Eve and 42nd Street, tearing apart those pipe dream stories that audiences have been so conditioned to absorb.Verhoeven's real target isn't Hollywood or American crassness, but rather those morally dubious Star is Born tales. The audience isn't punished for wanting to see sex and nudity, it's punished for wanting Nomi to succeed. The film is saying that in a crass society, success is bankrupt, and by pushing the pipe dream, you merely fuel this big, ugly machine.Nomi, the star of Showgirls, isn't a character. She's a piece of wood. A piece of wood not because she can't act, but because she's a mere slab of fuel, existing solely to be burnt up and combusted by her neon lit environment. She goes from strip club, to dance club, to theatre house, exploited all the way. And she loves it.By the end of the film it's not funny that Nomi is going to make the same mistakes all over again. It's sad that despite the fact that the Myth has been revealed repeatedly, she is still seduced by it enough to try all over again. It's like those Toys they give kids at Macdonald's. The child knows the toy is total crap, but they just have to collect the other one. Why? Because it's a toy, and the child's perception is that toys are fun.Showgirls deals with this false perception. The toy is crap. It's unsatisfying, but we want it because we can't find satisfaction in what we have and in where we're at.Showgirls is also intensely symbolic. Song titles mirror Nomi's apartment numbers, each of her jobs takes her one step further into hell (which ironically is her goal), she symbolically dies and is reborn, the famous lapdance is shot to mirror the sex scene in the pool, and the film ends with Nomi battered and broken and more importantly, even more ignorant than before. Then there's her dream man (hinted at by a billboard at the start) who turns out to be a devilish rapist by the end of the film. This theme of one being punished for ones fantasies permeates the entire film and extends outward in such a way that the audience itself participates. At first we're titillated, but by the end, the sex has numbed us and we reel in disgust.In terms of style, the film is intentionally over the top. It's loud, crass and overly colourful. Nomi herself thrusts her body at us in a ridiculously pathetic manner. The director's aim is not to titillate. He wants us to pity the girl's desperation, her falsity, the tasteless stains of her makeup and desperate contortions of her body. Nomi is dumb and is always begging us to accept her. And so Verhoeven subjects us to visual and aural overload, all designed to numb our minds. We leave the film stupid, and unaroused, poetically blind and unaware of the truths it has shown us.The best satires tend to raise the most unjustified hate, and Showgirls is no different. What's different is that the nudity, sex and overall tacky bad movie aesthetic of the film, prevents it from being re-evaluated or even embraced. Future audiences, desensitized to pornography and nudity, will probably accept this film easier.There's also one really good shot in the film that reminded me of Welles. The shot occurs when Nomi sits on a park bench alongside a busy street. The bench is in the foreground, but perspective is forced in such a way that it dwarfs the Las Vegas buildings surrounding it.In terms of camera work, the film is also impeccably shot. Verhoeven's camera is precise, with some beautiful steadicam and crane shots.7.5/10- An interesting satire, intentionally camp, cartoonish and over the top. Though some scenes feel tasteless, the film as a whole surprisingly seems to get better with repeated viewings. Pay attention to one scene in which children walk innocently through a theatre, nude women all around. Moment's later a woman curses violently and the kids and their mother are shocked. Verhoeven's point is clear language, violence and exploitation are far more tasteless than any naked breast.

Never before have so many cliches and ridiculous scenarios been gathered in one film.The plot?  A simple girl with big dreams travels to the big city to become A STAR!  She struggles against the odds, only to achieve her BIG BREAK! She rejects it all when she realizes that fame is hollow and disallusioning. Sounds like every show biz movie every made except in this version, the big dream is to be a topless showgirl, the big break involves literally breaking the competition's leg and fame involves wearing three sets of false eyelashes and sparkles as clothing.  The movie dislikes women so much that there is no female character in the whole of it that isn't either wildly catty or completely witless. Men in this film don't fare much better, but no male is subjected to a gang rape as the lone sympathetic female character is.If I remember correctly, Joe Esterhaus was paid a ridiculous amount of money for the screenplay for this film.

She spends most of the movie with a vacant expression on her face that gives way to unprovoked screaming fits.  Her character starts the film as a jerk who treats people badly and end the film as a jerk who treats people badly.  The plot, in fact, has no effect on her personality.  This is amazing, cuz the plot is such a lame moralistic fable to begin with.  Innocent girl (from NY City?) makes it to the big city, works her way up and finally succeeds by sinking to the depths of the people around her.  This makes her want to leave, cuz, you know, she's become everything she's ever hated or something.  The problem with this story is that Nomi STARTS OUT as an awful jerk who would push a colleague down some stairs to get ahead - she just hasn't thought of it yet.  So the story, which anyone over the age of four has seen before, is pointless.The dialogue is atrocious - it's Penthouse Letters stuff.  It's how horny old men think young women talk when they're in the bathroom.  That said, there's a lot dialogue in this movie that is unforgettable in the same way that Battlefield Earth makes variations on `I have leverage' unforgettable.Kyle MacLachlan spends the whole movie with a stupid stoner smirk plastered on his face.The sex&#133; ohmygod the sex.  The simulated sex scenes in this movie are comic gold.  At least twice that I remember Nomi mounts the MacLachlan character and does this move on him that looks kinda like a fish out of water.  Her spine&#133; it sorta whips up and down so that her torso is flipping in mid air. The hilarious part is that one of the sex scenes is in a hot tub and when Nomi does her thing, her body slaps and plops the water.  Besides being unerotic, the sex scenes go on forever.I have never, ever, before in my life, wanted women in movies to put some clothes on.  I admit it - I'm disgusting.  When the sex scene got started in Muholland Dr., the thought going through my mind was `THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!'  But Showgirls takes the juvenile male urge to stare at boobies and pummels it.  About half way through the film all I could think about the all those breasts is that support is a matter of comfort.  It just seemed merciless to depict a world where there are apparently so few bras.Anyway, that's the funny stuff.  Now for the awfulness.  Black people are nurturing.  There are two characters for Nomi to crap on, despite their best efforts to help her out.  Glenn Plummer plays a dancer who wants to help Nomi perfect her absolutely jaw-dropping dancing talent and Gina Rivera plays a sweet person who takes Nomi in when she arrives in Vegas.  When Rivera's character, Molly, first meets Nomi, Nomi is attacking Molly's car cuz her luggage was stolen and the car was nearby when she needed to hit something.  Instead of beating Nomi senseless, Molly buys her some food, offers to be her roommate and help finding a job.  And it goes on like that. Nomi is basically infantalized during scenes with Molly.  This is true of Glenn Plummer's character as well, who spends most of his screen time chastising Nomi like a parent about wasting her talent.  Of course, in the dark world of Showgirls, nice people can't exist.  Plummer's character turns out to be a guy who says that every girl is a dancer of extraordinary talent to sleep with them (but with Nomi, he really means it) and after mothering Nomi for half the movie, Molly gets gang raped cuz&#133; I dunno, victims are always asking for jerks to be nice to them and that's what she gets or something equally insightful.Everyone in the film keeps talking about how Nomi is a phenomenal dancer. I didn't see anything to justify this.  Actually, they labored the point so much that it invites scrutiny that her dancing can't live up to.  It's kinda cruel really.  What if someone made a movie with Steve Buscemi where everyone marvels at how handsome he is?  I don't think there's anything wrong with his appearance, but if you spent two hours being asked to look at him and admire his features...Anyway, this movie is bad in so many ways, but it's memorable.  It's like watching Plan 9 for the laughs, but different.  It played recently at the Midnight Mass in SF - a venue that plays camp classics like early John Waters and the Mommy Dearest.  Verhoeven and Eszthehas set out to make a naughty, dark movie.  Instead they made a crude, incompetent and disgusting film.  Showgirls is probably exactly the film they intended to make and that's why it's funny.Gina Gershon didn't stink.

Is LizBerk really the right choice to portray a young woman so irresistible that even though she is unfailingly rude, selfish and mean, everyone wants to bend over backwards to do nice things for? What I'd like everyone to pay attention to this time through, however, is the fact that this particular narrative only makes sense if you assume that it is taking place in an alternate universe with norms of behavior and physical laws radically different from our own. It's the sort of place where all that women talk about when they are together is their nails, their breasts and potato chips.

Not just accept her, they all love her. Nomi, a woman who reacts with violent hostility to simple questions or requests, displaying herself to be a complete sociopath. Yet, strangely, every person she snaps on sees her as something endearing or wonderful for some inexplicable reason. I just don't get it.In the beginning of the movie Nomi loses it on a total stranger, attacking the woman's car before being stopped and then vomiting for some unknown reason. The woman's response? Take her to dinner, but not before nearly kissing her in the most misplaced and misguided lesbian reaction. I would have called the cops. What next? I'll tell you. Nomi snaps again when asked a simple, harmless question by throwing the food the woman was treating her to and shouting. The woman's response? She asks Nomi to move in with her. What the hell?! Throughout the movie Nomi comes off as totally unlikable to the point that I found myself rooting against her, which is ironic seeing as how she is the protagonist of the film. To be fair, Nomi comes in a few flavors. I want to say she is bi-polar but that would leave out her middle ground the smarmy bitch flavor. I hate to use that word but it's the only way to justly describe her. You'll see. This is flavor is most often displayed when during any of her many disrespectful interactions with her employers and superiors. The cringe-worthy I was having my period excuse to her boss and her taunting of Cristal Conners (Gina Gershon) later in the film.She seems to follow some set of ill-defined and unbalanced set of morals that make no sense to anyone but her. Nomi all but whores herself out for success but draws a line at icing her nipples for some reason. Then throwing the ice at the casting director and exploding on him. Wow. Then she gets the job.With respect to Elizabeth Berkley, I don't know why so many people in this film saw her as this amazing beauty with so much talent. She is attractive, yes, but by no means the most attractive woman in the cast (even if you exclude Gina Gershon, who was gorgeous). Which leads up to an incredible, vomit-enducing scene between Nomi and Cristal about how great Nomi's breasts are. They're nothing special, in my opinion. The dialogue here.... Honestly, I can't do it justice. Nobody talks like people talk in this movie. Nobody. I want to see your ass, What do you think of your breasts?,I'm on my period. Check. This movie managed to make nude women, even those as beautiful and talented as Gina Gershon, unsexy. The dance numbers failed to entice any kind of sexual desire from me. How untalented must a filmmaker be to make a nude woman unsexy? Goddess would close in a week in real life.That just scratches the surface. There's so much about this movie that is just awful and makes little sense that I have no idea where to begin. When I have more time I hope to watch this movie and ammend my comment as I go.As awful as it is, it has more rewatchability than most movies I have ever seen. It's not because this movie is sexy, as the creators hoped, but because it is a moving demonstration of absurdity and a world that could only exist in the mind of people with no scope of social and sexual reality. It is funny, I admit, but still awful.

That shadowy shot of Sharon Stone's nether-regions seems positively demure in comparison to the all-out T&A parade that unfolds in this film and netted it the first NC-17 rating applied to a mass-market movie.In a performance with all the nuance of rotting garbage, Elizabeth Berkeley snarls, grunts, glares, and all but presents her hind-quarters for mounting like the wild animal she appears to be portraying. How appropriate that her character Nomi strips at a club called Cheetah's and appears in the climactic scene in matching leopard-print bustier and skirt! Berkeley's primary wild kingdom antagonist is the sultry Gina Gershon, whose pouty lips and well-manicured nails get literal and figurative workouts throughout the film, as lesbian lip-locks vie with clawing verbal catfights for on screen time while these two appear together.As much as I loved the badness of this movie the very first time I saw it, it really gets better (or is it worse?) every time I see it. Sometimes I'm tickled by bigger questions like Why does Gina Gershon's character take so much time and effort to torture this nobody Nomi chick? to smaller questions like, Why does Nomi appear in the poster for her big Vegas show wearing what looks like an Eva Gabor wig?

Writer, Joe Ezerhaus, known for his over-the-top, overly sexual, homophobic, woman-hating scripts has somehow managed to bring these abhorrent traits together in such a way as to fascinate. Clearly prejudiced towards lesbians and gays, Ezerhaus writes with a strange pen here... at once homophobic but at the same time so outrageous that it can't be taken seriously. Berkley's performance is dead-on (many panned it, but really she showed true style and wit bringing a charm to a role designed to be offensive), if not for this Naomi would have been a nasty unsympathetic character and the film really would have just sucked. So, ultimatly, no credit to Ezerhaus! The success of this film (and I'm not talking box-office) resides solely on the performances and directing. With a lesser cast and director this would have been helpless trash, but Gina Gershon, Paul Verhoeven and Elizabeth Berkley bring it to life. Great dance sequences, and cool costumes make for an enjoyable film. I could have done without the brutal rape scene though.

The idea, I suppose, was that prolonged exposure to something bad will, psychologically, turn off all urges to repeat that same offense. Horse Pucky! I decried, not believing such a tale could possibly be true . . . until I saw Showgirls. I like sexy naked women as much as the next guy but after this movie was jiggled in my face for two and a half hours, I didn't want to see another naked body for about the next two years (Freud would have eaten me alive).I doubt that the movie had the same effect on Joe Esterhauz, the author from whose pen this sheepdip flowed. Not long after the movie came out, I was watching one of those making of specials and Esterhauz said that the movie was a hard-boiled expose on the empowerment of women (yeah . . . okay). The special boasted that this was a recurring theme throughout his work which includes Basic Instinct, Flashdance, Jade and Sliver. I guess that Joe and I must have different ideas about female empowerment because his idea seems to be to portray women as hookers, strippers, killers and raging lesbian predators (anything outside those four categories and they're fishfood). He apparently thinks that their best activities for empowerment are knives, lesbianism, sex for cash, violence and nasty sneers (Mr. Freud, you would have had to put overtime in on this one).In Showgirls, the women could be any one of these things. Violence is so much an afterthought to their personalities that it comes out in their speech, their clothes, their stares, their dancing and even their collegian stuffed lips. It oozes from every pore and even comes out in a scene at a fast food restaurant when the heroine furiously squirts ketchup all over her french fries. For me that scene proved a commentary on the film because, well, you know how when you squeeze a plastic ketchup bottle it makes that loud flatulent noise? You get the idea.I think Joe knows that he has a lousy script because he keeps throwing in deterrents so that we hopefully won't realize that the script is featherweight. Deterrence like nudity for example which got the film an NC-17 but should have been an NC-95 so no one would have had to sit through it. The characters reside in Vegas but the movie might as well have been staged in a nudist colony. Nearly every scene is littered with wall to wall skin, whether the scene calls for it or not. They dance naked, they sleep naked, they eat naked, they talk while they're naked. The movie is so jam packed with nakedness that the sexy parts are when the women put their clothes back on! Esterhauz turns out the be the only boob attached to this project that is not on screen.The movie follows the destiny of a walking bag of hostility named Nomi Malone (played by Elizabeth Berkley whose acting comes in two flavors Stare blankly and blink) who has killer looks and the brain of an appliance bulb. She's a leather-clad bad-chick from the wrong side of the tracks who hitches to Vegas to become a dancer. How are we to be sure that she's bad? She wears leather, carries a switchblade and cakes on enough make-up to make Tammy Faye wince.Perhaps, she figures, all that badness makes her a human shield against that cold and unfeeling landscape of bitter failure and resentment known as Las Vegas. When she gets there she finds that Vegas is, well, a cold and unfeeling landscape of bitter failure and resentment.Everyone in the movie approaches Nomi like a lion smacking it's chops. Everyone hates each other (which makes us hate them and therefore the movie) but Esterhauz explains that in this hellish world of hostility and sexual vengeance Nomi learns a lesson in morality (Really? I must have blinked).Before the sun sets on her first day in Vegas, Nomi makes a new best friend, becomes her roommate and gets a job at a strip club - and she's STILL ticked off!! The roommates situation is just an excuse for pseudo-semi-sorta-kinda halfway attempt at some lesbian shenanigans hinted at because Nomi and Molly sleep naked in the same bed. Read that again and keep in mind that they've only known each other for one day.Nomi has dreams of getting a gig with a jiggle and light show called Goddess which we are told is the hottest show in town (Yeah, maybe if it were the ONLY show in town). I can't figure why she's so eager to get a part in this thing. IT'S TERRIBLE!! It's like a bizarre tribal dance in which the dancers contort in front of feux volcanoes and do spidery things with their fingers. It's like a strange pseudo-seductive dance on Star Trek only the performers lack the decency to look humiliated.The show, like the movie is dull, real dull. So dull that you begin looking in the backgrounds for other things to look at. The sets for the show and indeed the entire movie are a hammered collection of sharp, shiny things that glitter in the background and I guess are suppose to make things look sexy.

I dunno if this is a common misconception, but it's untrue in the face of it.Instead I see a girl who fiercely tries to cling to her dignity in a business that denies it, who sleeps with the only nice man she knows (even though we know he's just another scumbag) and pushes back when she's been pushed to the edge. Her perspective is skewed, but it's not without a sense of moral purpose to it. I see in her a broken human being trying to remain whole, in this sense her character fascinates me in the same way someone like Daniel Plainview does.

But anyway, its about her trying to make it dancing in Las Vegas, and her All About Eve relationship with Gina Gershon's character. There's definitely something strange and sinister going on here that has nothing to do with titillation. The problem is, it comes across as tawdry exhibitionism. You have to look beyond the boobs and into the cold and spiky performance from lead actress Elizabeth Berkley. Its a strange one when she's not angry, she's bratty and entitled. The narrative, such as it is, buckles badly 50 minutes in under its massive lack of stakes or anything interesting happening. So I can understand the Razzies and the hatred.When I was younger, Showgirls was always a guilty pleasure for me because of the nudity. Looking at it now, I'm baffled as to why. In Showgirls, sex is almost warfare. Its an open act of aggression. The strippers are openly hostile towards the clientele the entire time, and in general have this mutually abusive relationship. There's always violent thrusting or swearing. Its actually pretty interesting, but you have to see it enough times so you're not titillated any more to get to the message, which is a pretty obvious one about the abusiveness of the sex industry that nevertheless didn't earn the film any respect.

Not 'bad' in a good way. I knew the movie was going to be a bit naughty with a NC-17 rating, but I didn't know how dumb, the film was going to be. This movie could had been a really good social commentary movie about women who work in the sex industry of Vegas but the movie took a wrong turn, somewhere in production. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas, the badly written, film plot is simple enough that a brain death idiot can get it. It's about Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) a bitchy person who treat people like crap, hiking to Las Vegas, hoping to make it as a showgirl. On the way, she get help from some odd reason by Molly Abrams (Gina Ravera). I guess, she likes the way Nomi beat up her car in rage when Nomi get her stuff stolen. Lucky for Nomi, Molly happens to be a seamstress and costume designer for the Goddess, a Stardust Casino show where Nomi hopes to work. She takes Nomi in as a roommate and set up an interview with Stardust's top showgirl dancer, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). For some odd reason, Cristal loves to humiliate Nomi and arranges so many auditions for the chorus line of Goddess that she got the part. Although, Cristal is bi-sexual, she treats Nomi like she's a whore. Honestly, what is it her always trying to make Nomi feel cheap. There is no reason for Cristal get her a job, knowing full well that Nomi wants to claim her mantle and become the star of her show. Its bi-polar thrill-seeker dangerous dumb. While Nomi finally secured the fame and fortune she sought by doing the offensive stuff that Cristal said, she would do Molly's life turn to the worst with Molly meeting musician, Andrew Carver (William Shockley) who rape her. Since Andrew Carver is the Stardust's high-profile celebrity client, Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan), theater director for the casino want Nomi to keep it quiet by giving her hash-money. Nomi is force to choose from a life of fame or exposing the scandal for her friend. Honestly, what was the point of this movie? Some characters like James Smith (Glenn Plummer) are totally pointless as he plays little part in the main story, yet, he get way too much screen time. The acting is mediocre. Not the worst, but not the best. The dialogue in this movie is the worst with its corny offensive nature and bad timing. What did I learn from this movie, black people will help you for no good reason, all men are horny perverts and everybody got AIDS. The script seem like an extreme badly-written version of 1950's All about Eve with its themes. Why would anybody pay $2 million for the script, this bad? Then why did United Artist produced on a then-sizable budget of approximately $45 million knowing full well that a NC-17 film wouldn't make lot of money? The film's amounts of graphic sex and nudity is what make most people want to watch this film. It wasn't the 1970s, where soft-core porn had to be seen in theaters. It was the 1990's, where adults could just buy or rent sexual relate VCRs movie and watch them in their house with a lot more privacy. The movie should had went straight to video. It makes no sense!!! Showgirls was the first NC-17 rated film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters. Since it had audience restriction due to the NC-17 rating, the movie bomb bad. The movie really made Stardust look bad to the point, the whole casino went under years later. Honestly, this movie killed many careers with its unlikeable characters. Elizabeth Berkley was never a good actress even during her time in 1989's Save by the Bell, TV Show, but gees, she is really bad in this movie. Her dancing is really awful as she slow as hell to hit the steps. Nomi is perfectly willing to do what came down to live, on-stage lesbian sex, screwing her boss to get a higher position, and pushing the lead dancer down the stairs to get her job, but she won't use ice cubes to make her nipples perky. What? Nomi is always angry. It's so annoying. It was a bit shocking at the time to see Berkley strip nude, since her character in Save by the Bell, Jesse Spano was a Feminism. Lot of females were alienated by the film's misanthropic attitude not only toward its characters and subject matter, but also the general human existence. Some men hate it too, as men are made to look bad and females look bat crazy. For an exploitation satire film. Fans got what they wanted. Vulgar and crude of what Vegas is, behind the glamour. It just wasn't that funny, or fun to watch. It's not that hard to find if you really want to watch it. But if you watch it on TV Due to the film's rampant and gratuitous nudity, a censored version was created with black bras and panties digitally rendered to hide all exposed breasts and genitals. Also, several scenes were removed entirely. It's brutally cut up so watch out. It's just better to find the DVD. There is a version known as Director's R-Rated Version, but like I said before. It's just cut up too much to watch. If you going to watch it, watch the NC-17 version. The Los Angeles freeway sign at the end of the movie, was a hint at a sequel was already planning for, but was abandoned when this movie debuted. The sequel was to have Nomi going to Hollywood and take on the movie business. Anyways, it kinda happen with an unofficial spin-off 2011 sequel titled 'Penny's from Heaven', released direct-to-video. It's just as bad. Overall Showgirls had its cult followers, but what happen in Vegas, should had stay in Vegas. "},{"Title":"A first A re-review. Spoilers","Date":"2 June 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Back in November, 2000, I did a review for the infamous Showgirls, but it was written despite the fact that I had not seen the movie for several years, and until last week, I had still not seen the movie until I obtained a DVD player, with one objective being to see the NC-17 version of the film for the first time in years.I want to say that the DVD's invention is a blessing. Back in early 1996, MGM/UA decided to release two versions of Showgirls on VHS one that was the original, and the other a toned down R-Rated version. Of course, the Lacklusters and Rogers here in Canada wanted the chopped-up version, so I went to the Mom-and-Pop stores to get the REAL version. Sadly, those stores are gone, with only the huge Lacklusters and Rogers left and their toned-down versions of this film. With the advent of DVD, that kind of marketing has fallen to the wayside, and now, anyone can get the film they wanted.Believe it or not, I actually want to defend Elizabeth Berkley in this re-review. Berkley, of course, probably wouldn't amount to no more than a mediocre thespian, which is actually quite good these days. Most of the blame for her poor performance should have been hung on Joe Eszterhas. The former superstar writer gave her horrible dialogue, filled with profanity and vapid sentences. He did a poor job in developing the character of Nomi Malone. All we get are the aforementioned dialogue, plus long periods of silence. I noticed in my two+ viewings last week that Berkley has little of anything to say. While the other characters have more to offer in development and dialogue, Elizabeth is saddled with this crap. I wonder if, say, Denise Richards or others who tried for the part had won the role, would they have to deliver the same lines, or was Eszterhas so unconfident of Berkley that he overhauled his script to make it more suitable for the limited actress to handle. I guess we'll never know.Despite the NC-17 rating, the movie isn't that strong. Yes, there is a lot of nudity, but most of it is topless. Nothing more than what you'd see with Drive-In fare. Only the rape scene might be strong or the beating Nomi administers to Andrew Carver. Perhaps the sexual touching? I actually agree with Siskel & Ebert that the R-Rated Seven with Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Morgan Freeman that opened the same week as Showgirls is more worthy of a NC-17 rating due to its gruesome content.I still defend the movie as a guilty pleasure, as there are so many scenes that are memorable. One scene that made me laugh was when Nomi is exposed as the criminal she is, and Kyle McLachlan's Zack Carey asks her how much she charged johns, and after saying $50, maybe $100., he says Boy, Nomi you have such low self-esteem. You know you're a fantastic f**k. Nomi smiles at him, then spits right in his face and walks out on him. Truly hilarious, although a sad reminder of what Berkley had to work with.With the Britney-esquire dance scenes, the Las Vegas glamour, and Verhoeven's good direction; along with all the memorable scenes, it all adds up to a truly fun must-see film. Yes it's terrible, but it's the ultimate So bad it's good film. By the way, I wonder if James Smith could hook me up with some jobs when I move to Las Vegas in October for the winter, he seems to find them with regularity... "},{"Title":"I have a theory about this film...","Date":"23 February 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Well, actually, it concerns the three films Paul Verhoeven has made since Basic Instinct. In order, they are Showgirls, Starship Troopers, and Hollow Man. Think back to the time when Basic Instinct was released, and a sexually repressed American nation, despite the misguided and utterly stupid protests of gay activists, was acknowledging for the first time since the 1970s that sex is a natural, healthy part of life and nothing to be ashamed of. The so-called Erotic Thriller had become a new mainstream, and this is where Verhoeven's problems with the mainstream American media began.As Hollow Man quickly demonstrates, the more mainstream Paul Verhoeven's films become, the more slated they get by the critics. Which is fair enough - the less it works, too. Starship Troopers toned down the sex to almost American standards (the sex scene is still far more stimulating than anything American directors have produced), and brought the violence up to a level more palatable to American audiences. It is a well-known statistical fact outside of America that parents in the USA are more comfortable with their children seeing other human beings torture and multilate one another than they are with their children seeing a decent, healthy act that forms the basic step in how our species perpetuates itself.Critics in America attacked Starship Troopers as being facistic and shallow, when the reality is that the film was based upon the same propaganda films that were shown to young Americans in the 1940s. The critical misbalance was even more apparent with Hollow Man, Verhoeven's most mainstream film to date. Here he was, giving American audiences what they indicated they want, while lacing it with a morality play based on what happens when a man with Christianised morals loses his accountability, and the critics had the nerve to claim it had no story. I think there is something fundamentally wrong with American media in light of that.Returning to the time when Showgirls was produced, the Erotic Thriller was the newest idea from Hollywood, and Basic Instinct brought a whole different audience to the theatre - those who wanted softcore porn and weren't afraid of the fact. Unfortunately, one of the minds who was responsible for creating this whole new sub-genre, Joe Eszterhas, is quite patently a sick, misogynistic, and repressed individual. Just like the gay activists protesting Basic Instinct unfairly charged Verhoeven with homophobia, ironically. If you don't believe me, I invite you to take a look at Eszterhas' two subsequent films, Sliver and Jade, then tell me that Verhoeven is solely responsible for the misogynistic flavour of Showgirls.Of course, the difference between Showgirls and Basic Instinct is that when Basic Instinct was made, Eszterhas still had to sell his screenplays to studios, whereas he only had to say I wrote Basic Instinct when trying to shuffle his screenplays for Showgirls, Jade, and Sliver to studios. Seriously, watch those three together, they should be called the misogyny trilogy.Anyway, the whole upshot of this is that Paul Verhoeven is currently copping a very raw deal from the critics. While I wouldn't call his last two films faultless, even Showgirls deserves to have its artistic merits considered. Any film that is released in a repressive society like America and somehow manages to turn nudity into a uniform has got to have something going for it.Frankly, I hope Paul does go through with the idea he was contemplating earlier - to go back to Europe and make films without the atmosphere of retarded, repressive critics and the Motion Picture Annoyance Association breathing down his neck. Maybe back there he can make films that portray the world as it really is instead of having to sugar-coat it for Americans who don't like having the mirror held up to their Christian sexual repression. Or better still, I hope his next project once again engages Ed Neumeier's services as a screenwriter.

This is the first film I ever saw that made nudity boring.  The script is ridiculous, the acting even more so, and the direction passable at best.  I won't belabor those points; if you're gonna see it anyway, you'll know what I mean.For those who think that Paul Verhoeven created a 'satire' of American culture, and then point to his past work (Basic Instinct, Total Recall) as proof, think again.  Those movies did nothing but pander to the lowest common denominator, but at least there was a basic intelligence to the approach.  All the brains done leaked out of Showgirls at the script stage.   The only people who would be impressed with Showgirls as 'satire' are the same ones who are impressed with professional wrestling as 'sport'.  Verhoeven is a passable director who insists on directing comic-book movies like Robocop (another one that somehow people view as 'satire').  He's out to grab you with either bloody violence, nudity, or both.  His formula ran out on him here.  You can't blame it all on Eszterhaus.And, oh my, is Elizabeth Berkeley a bad actress or what??  She redefines scenery-chewing in this one.

Kyle MacLachlan was, presumably, taking the paycheque and enjoying the close company of assorted unclad young ladies as he did so. Only Gina Gershon emerges with any real credit.The word for this movie is lurid - in the way that Harold Robbins' novels were lurid in the late fifties and early sixties. The difference is that the sexuality displayed in Showgirls is a lot more overt than Robbins was allowed to be at the time (although he got more explicit as time went on).Verhoeven clearly intends to be melodramatic and over the top and achieves this with a kind of perverse entertainment value, albeit enjoyment derived from beneath eyebrows raised in disbelief.Poor Miss Berkley gives it her everything as she flashes her bits and indulges in the most preposterously improbable, but beautifully photographed, simulated sex scene ever.This is a film to be treasured and shunned at the exact same time.

In-between, a century of entertainment and moviemaking. SHOWGIRLS is Verhoeven's birthday present to Cinema's 100 years. Verhoeven knows film history and film technique pretty well  movies are, first of all, grand illusions made of light and movement, plus a few other components. With SHOWGIRLS, a brilliantly insane script offered the director a unique opportunity to mix all these components of modern commercial cinema into one hell of a movie  light and movement, colour and music, dialogue and gesture, action and melodrama. All brought to their most outrageous heights. Plus tits... One thing is missing though  the eye-popping explosion you would have found in almost every American movie made in the 1990's. Well, maybe the explosion is this movie itself. Verhoeven knew perfectly well what he was doing with SHOWGIRLS  he was throwing a second degree stinker at the audience and the reviewers. Most hated it, a few hugely enjoyed it. And enjoy it more with each viewing. Some day, an entire book will certainly be written about SHOWGIRLS by a cultural studies buff. This movie tells so much about what is entertainment today  teasing and bad taste, as in the incredibly tacky picture of Nomi on the freeway poster in the last shot of the movie.

I was waiting all along for some serious twist to happen, and after seeing it (a few times), I am still at the same point. I guess seeing Basic Instinct I was expecting too much from Eszterhas (or maybe Verhoeven?). By my opinion the final moral of this story is, if you want to succeed in showbiz, cheat and walk over the bodies, but don't get caught at it. If you do, move to another town and start doing it again. Is that what Hollywood is all about?I think Elizabeth Berkley was persuasive enough in her desire of moving up, but Gina Gershon was not given enough space to prove her talent (will somebody eventually notice her capabilities, please?). And since I am more of a romantic soul, I didn't focus that much on a getting a career content (maybe this was my mistake), but on a relationship between people part. So, what was this chemistry between them all about? The first time I saw the movie, it was dubbed in Italian, so I understood only part of the story. And I had the feeling, Nomi and Crystal had something going on. After seeing it in original, I still think the same, only I am not sure anymore, what this something was. Was it a rivalry between them? This is what was obvious from Berkley's performance. She seemed too much of an ice rock, only focused on getting to the top. So, if this was the case, why was it necessary to include that eating-each-other-with-eyes scenes, those hand caresses, those dance scenes with them almost kissing, etc? Well, I guess there was supposed to be something more, and this was obvious from Gershon's performance. Although putting Nomi on a solid ground about what showgirls really are, Gershon knew for sure how to express Crystal's desire for Nomi. And this was the point that left me thirsty. A kiss at the end of the movie was fulfilling this desire? I think Crystal felt the same, brilliant Gershon's acting in that last scene made this clear.Thanks to great Gina Gershon's performance I am rating this movie 8/10.

Nomi Malone is a strong willed person. Elizabeth Berkley has ratcheted up the strong willed nature several levels from the very strong willed Jesse Spano in Saved By The Bell. They are in two different worlds. One is comfortable middle class America and the other is the predatory sex trade. She shows that only the tough survive and she is more than up to the task. Amazingly she shows extreme vulnerability at times and at those times she needs support from a good friend. When her friend is brutally raped, Nomi takes matters into her own hands and kicks the crap out of the rapist. If only justice could be dispensed so quickly and correctly.I liked the full circle that ended the movie.

The package includes two discs. Contrary to what is indicated on the back of the case, the Blu-ray high-res version, encoded in MPEG-4, is not on the same disc with the bulk of the special features. Rather, the MPEG-4 high-res version is on one disc, and the special features that are listed on the case are on the disc that has the DVD version.Even though high-res version is encoded in MPEG-4 (vs. MPEG-2) and even though it is encoded at a bit rate about 10x greater than the bit rate used for the MPEG-2 (DVD) version, it is not very much sharper at all. In truth, it is just barely possible to tell any difference at all. I had to switch back and forth several times to convince myself that there was any difference at all, and prior to doing that I was ready to conclude that they had simply taken the DVD version and re-encoded it in MPEG-4 at a higher bit rate (which is technically possible). The Blu-ray version also suffers a terrible annoyance that the DVD version does not have each and every time that you press the pause key or the fast forward key, there is a large progress bar that covers up much of the screen. The capability for the disc to implement this progress bar is one of the features of Blu-ray (which I feel is entirely pointless), but this annoying progress bar is much larger and more annoying than any other such progress bar that I have seen to date, on any of the Blu-ray discs in my collection of several dozen.The bottom line is that this Blu-Ray is not appreciably better than the older DVD version, and not worth the additional cost, even for someone who does not own the DVD version and who, for whatever reason, wants to own a copy of this ridiculous movie. The only attraction here is Elizabeth Berkley, and there just isn't any reason to buy the buy the Blu-Ray version. If you have to have it, save yourself a few bucks and get the DVD version.

Now that I've seen it on HBO, I have to confirm it's simply dreadful.First of all, it's tough to find a casino show (or shows, since for some reason this casino had a good 1+1/2 hours worth of dancing) quite that bad. Most shows after 11PM are topless (even the curtain pullers at the sea lion show). But I am hard pressed to think of a single show where the primary concern is whether the girls' nipples are erect. Yes, backstage is just a fountain of nudity, but up front? Gee whiz, can't say that the shows in Vegas are quite so detail oriented.And I would be mighty peeved if I were in a casino and I had to pay $60, plus the pre-requisite $20 tip, to get into such an amazingly tawdry, OK, that's just a nice way to say bad with tits show. Even if we got comp'd, I'd be peeved. I do have to give praise for coming up with the most amazing reason for massive amounts of breast exposure in a movie. There could have been more, but I don't know how.Secondly, that television editing managed to pull out lots of lame scenes, like sex in the pool (wow, that Elizabeth is a workhorse, but I worry about her back) and even more lame lines (such as every single one prefaced with dahrlin' and I just had to have (a Ferrari)). Shakespeare can rest easy.Thirdly, the lesbian angle, sex, Kyle's hair, and violence never went anywhere. We had one lesbian kiss at the end (so?), the completely unconvincing sex in the pool (again, Elizabeth must have a standing appointment with a chiropractor) and one rape scene (which, if you have to have violence, is really the worst sort, but was completely unconvincing). We could have used a bit more of one of these - any of the above.Amusing ramp up movie for the bachelor party and good for critiquing how movies designed to be deliberately commercial can go wrong - I really see no other redeeming feature.

This requires the ability to draw great performances from even marginally competent actors so as to consistently create well rounded characters. To see this we need only compare his film characters with those of (for example) Stanley Kubrick, or even David Hamilton who has shown a much greater ability to exploit nudity without turning his characters into caricatures. Although Verhoeven has created some very complex characters such as Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct, few if any of them could be called well rounded. He has acknowledged that he long wanted to create a true NC17 film, designed and created from the start for a purely adult audience and several of his earlier films were intended for this purpose, but their backers always forced enough cuts in the final draft to allow the film concerned to receive an R rating. Showgirls was his first film funded in advance to allow for an NC17 rating and it pulls no punches in showing the seamy side of both the Las Vegas entertainment industry and the characters in the film. The outline story is very similar to Flashdance - gifted but untrained dancer has big dreams, but is forced to work in a floor show to earn money until a big break comes - and the critics did not care for either film. But Jennifer Beals' character in Flashdance was much more rounded than Elizabeth Berkeley's in Showgirls, and it attracted enough audience appreciation to prevent Flashdance's run ending prematurely. It is not realistic to blame EB for the fact that the character of the brazen hussy with a vicious temper which she played made this impossible for Showgirls. Did Joe Eszterhas not appreciate that the exploitation of more sympathetic characters would have contributed more to the development of his story? Mick Martin in his well known Video Guide writes that Showgirls is possibly the worst ever big studio production, and comments that this is in part due to the atrocious acting of Elizabeth Berkeley. Such comments are nonsense - EB may not be a great actress, but she appears to me to have done everything her Director demanded reasonably competently - to blame the failure of the film on her acting is grossly unfair. Its problems resulted from bad scriptwriting which featured nothing but unending sleaze that becomes increasingly hard for any audience to continue enjoying. The film satirises sexual exploitation by the entertainment industry, but falls into the trap of itself using sexual exploitation to attract its audience. This generated a puritanical backlash in the U.S.A. that led to it being almost universally trashed. (Apparantly this did not happen to nearly the same extent in other countries where SG remains a well respected work).Much of the dialogue is smart, witty and enjoyable, but this was not enough to save the film when there were no sympathetic characters to attract the empathy of the audience. However, as many IMDb users have recognised, it remains both enjoyable and effective in its exposure of show-business foibles if the viewer accepts its limitations and concentrates on its strengths whilst watching. It attempted to highlight, not just the exploitation of girl performers, but the fact that even top showgirls in major reviews in Las Vegas are at least as subject to this exploitation as the strippers in small and shabby bars. It failed largely because major misjudgments made the film itself appear exploitive. For making an honest attempt to achieve a difficult objective I feel it deserved more credit than it received. As for humour, one scene will in my opinion become a classic. This is where the producer of the revue is auditioning a group of 20 or so girls for a vacant spot in his chorus line. He starts by telling them he is a prick and goes on to reduce the potential candidates to the final two by humiliating each girl as badly as he can before dismissing her. When he asks Elizabeth Berkeley (Nomi) why she is participating if she has had no formal dance training, she sweetly replies that she came to watch him being a prick. More scenes such as this and her career might have survived the debacle. In fairness to Hollywood, playing the part of a stripper no longer means curtains for an actress - among others, Darryl Hannah and Demi Moore can testify to this. But the part played must display acting abilities as well as a shapely bosom and, sadly, Showgirls gave EB little chance to do this.If your only interest is seeing a skin flick with virtually no story, EB in Showgirls exposes more skin more often and for longer than most girls in other T & A films. More important, if you are prepared to see a badly flawed but interesting and sometimes challenging film, and will not be upset by this exposure, you should forget the adverse reviews and rent a copy.

I'd heard about it of course. I knew of it as the film that ruined Paul Verhoeven's career in America, one of the biggest flops of all time and a movie with an infamously heavy dose of frontal nudity. To put it simply, this film has not had a good press.So what is Showgirls about? The story revolves around Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley), a drifter and dancer, who comes to Las Vegas with the usual dreams of stardom and success. Initially, Nomi finds work in a sleazy strip club before an encounter with Gina Gershon and Kyle MacLachlan presents her with an opportunity to audition for a role for the inane and supposed hit show, 'Goddess'.Essentially, its the old 'climb up the ladder' story with a small town girl battling against sleazy nightclub owners, rival dancers, corrupt producers, pop stars and, eventually, her own ruthless ambition as she tries to make a living and a name for herself. It's also a tale about the depravity of Las Vegas- and people in general.So what's wrong with Showgirls? Why the bad press? Let's start with the main character Nomi. Despite being the female lead, I found it a tremendous struggle to empathize with this character. This was because of Nomi's inability to react to almost anything without throwing a temper tantrum. After about twenty minutes of the film, I seriously began to question whether this character really was the good guy and not a Catherine Tramell-esquire beautiful psycho. I don't think five minutes went by without Nomi shouting at someone or storming off in a major huff! Also, later on the movie, she was responsible for some pretty heinous acts of violence. I hate whiter-than-white characters in films because not only are they annoying, they're unrealistic. However, there's no point in a film if it can't make you, in even the slightest way, feel for the main character(s). At any point, did I cheer the brainless savage that was Nomi on? The answer is an emphatic no.If anything, considering her many sins, I half-expected the ending to provide some poetic justice that would show Nomi just how stupid she'd been and teach change her ways. This did not happen. In fact, the ending appeared to suggest (in an effort to set up a sequel) that Nomi was going to take her pouts, tits and merciless beatings to Hollywood and continue her reign of terror there. Nomi is not alone in being impossible to like. There is not a single likable character in this movie. Whether this is a statement on show business, I cannot say but what I can say is that it doesn't help the movie any. Perhaps Nomi's best friend and trailer buddy, Molly Abrams- as perhaps the only nice person in all of Las Vegas- is the only exception. It doesn't help any of the characters that they were imprisoned within a quite awful, awful, awful (yes, it really is worth three awfuls) script. I wasn't expecting sharp, witty or remotely intelligent dialogue but I at least expected a shade of realism. Instead, I was wincing at practically every sentence that came out of each and every person's mouth.The main antagonist could be said to be Nomi's rival, Cristal (Gershon) but I think the entire dirty, nasty world actually assumes that role. As such, and with Nomi proving just as dirty and nasty as the rest of mankind, there's no one to like and far too many people to dislike for this film to prosper.Gratuitous nudity and graphic violence are a staple of Paul Verhoven's cinematic output. They're in his good films (i.e. RoboCop) and his bad (i.e. Hollowman). Like the previous teaming of director Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas, Basic Instinct, the threadbare plot ensures that Showgirls is less a story of any real substance but simply of a piece of erotica produced on a Hollywood budget.Showgirls has a lot of nudity. I don't think the word gratuitous even does it credit. Berkley spends a great deal of the film nude in some capacity. Her lap dance on Kyle MacLachlan is frighteningly frenetic and yet, despite being near the beginning, is probably the film's first and last exciting sexual scene of note. Their swimming pool sex scene is similarly fantastically overblown (how Berkley doesn't give herself terrible whiplash during what amounts to a tremendously OTT sexual fit is a miracle).Elizabeth Berkley is a well put-together girl and so it's no chore to look at her naked. However, soon enough, the enormous volume of nudity renders any intended shock or even erotic value of such exposure meaningless. You are soon desensitized to the naked flesh thrust in your face essentially for the entire duration of the movie. Beyond the sheen of tanned skin and constant barrage of T&A, there is nothing to Showgirls but a childishly simple premise dressed up with awful dialogue and unsympathetic characters that is desperately, with the aid of its oodles of nudity, attempting to masquerade as a serious adult film.So why did I watch this film and why did I review and write so much about it? Firstly, I watched the film because I was curious. I kept on watching because it so awfulness was just so damn entertaining. Yes, this is the film's singular redemption- it is so, so bad that it's actually fun to watch!

In short, it's one of the more watchable bad films of the era.Eliabeth Berkley is the girl who just wants to make it in what she's got, which of course is her body. She does want to make it in acting too, or dancing, or one of those fields someone who goes out to Vegas aside from the gambling goes for. She of course becomes a stripper, but also gets a gig in a high-class showgirl showcase in a casino, with a rival in the extremely sexy Gina Gershon. Of course there are some meaningless sub-plots, one of which with Kyle MacLaughlin, and an ending that's so around the corner you'd need beer goggles to lose sight of it. So really, why would one want to recommend Showgirls? Is it for the the obvious right away, the same stuff that you can see in slightly lesser quality on Cinemax after midnight? The choreography of the dances on stage involving the massive sets and special effects? Or for the storyline and acting, which pillages every single low-rent melodrama on Lifetime crossed with every bad soft-core you've seen perusing through Blockbuster? One can say for sure Berkley's had better days, especially so with MacLaughlin, although Gershon does seem to come out of all this as one of the better things in the film. In the end, I would recommend Showgirls to see perhaps once, maybe just to usher in the youth to know this is and is NOT how sex in Vegas is, or for something 'different' from Verhoven. At times it's laughably bad, and yet I almost mean that as a minor compliment; there's something to be said about films like these, where you feel sort of filthy after watching it, but your at least glad there aren't more out there like this. Some may even find it as a 'cult' classic. I'm not one of them. But I was glad to see it once, or twice depending on the time of night...

This is one of the dumbest dramas(?) of all time. The ultra-clich√© premise of a wide-eyed bimbo - with a mysterious past - hitch-hiking her way to Vegas to become a showgirl is a premise that writers of pulp-fiction would shy away from on grounds that it is too cheap and dumb. Berkeley's awful over-acting is hard not to notice from the very start (though, in a way, it fits the movie), but I can't help but sympathize with her because she looks as though she believed that this role was her big breakthrough chance which made her try really, really hard, giving it her all to do it right. (It makes me cringe. I really pity that dumb woman.) But the harder she tried, the more she overacted, and the worse she got. Additionally, far from being her big break, this film will probably haunt her forever.Pitiful attempts to make statements or send messages, or just to philosophize, fall so very, very flat. The characterization is a combination of movie-clich√© stereotypes and illogical, hence unpredictable behaviour. Ultra-cretinous dialog infests this strange, Verhoevenish Las Vegas showgirl world, and a multitude of dumb - sometimes mind-numbingly dumb - scenes abound kids in dressing-rooms, girl-fights in dressing rooms, ice being used as nipple-hardener, the rasta guy losing his job for the second time over Berkeley, the sabotage of a showgirl colleague by throwing marbles(?) on the stage - so that she may break a bone or two (very funny), rape by celebrity, revenge for rape of friend by means of karate chops, etc.Verhoeven would like to have us believe that the world of Las Vegas showgirls is no different than the Old Wild West if there is someone who displeases you or that you don't like you just spit in their face, or punch them, or throw marbles(?) on the floor while they're dancing, or push them down a flight of stairs, or fight them in the dressing-room, etc. And what's with Berkeley's sudden display of martial arts moves on the unsuspecting rock star? I mean, we know that she has her mysterious past and all that, but does this mean that she is a karate expert as well? There's plenty of t**s'n'a** here, but I must say that it's the dialogs that steal the show from the showgirls. Examples I liked you when you came... I liked your blue eyes... (Kyle) You have great t**s. They're really beautiful. (Gershon)Thank you... (Berkeley) You're a stripper! (Davi) No, I'm a dancer! (Berkeley) I have a problem with pussy. I always have and I'm always gonna, but I meant what I said to you (previously). (rasta guy) You know, it's not like I'm seein' any money from writin' that number (song). I may as well touch a little p**sy. (rasta guy) Must be weird not having anybody come on you... (Davi)You f***ed her, didn't you? (Gershon) Does that p*ss you off 'cause you're jealous, Chris, or because I beat you to the punch? (Kyle) There's also this strange fascination that everyone seems to have for Berkeley's character, as soon as she reaches Vegas the black girl offers her free lodging; Kyle - although constantly surrounded by naked girls - gets more horny than ever over Berkeley; Gershon, Kyle's woman and show-star, can't wait to get a lesbian thing going with Berkeley (who, as a true blond free-spirit with a shady past has - naturally - nothing against a little lesbianism on the side); the rasta guy loses two jobs for Berkeley, while being constantly rejected by her (even kicked in the groin at one point); Davi and the fat woman actually go to visit her when she makes it big as a showgirl, etc.The most unbelievable part is that Verhoeven didn't set out to create a camp classic - he actually was aiming to make a great drama (his interviews made this quite clear); he took this script SERIOUSLY. Already in Basic Instinct (and Total Recall to some extent) there were signs that this director didn't care much for logic or stamping out absurdities in scripts, but who would have thought that he'd be capable of one day creating a monster-mess of this kind.

Man, Elizabeth Berkeley may be a dreadful actress and dancer, but she is quite a beauty, and has no problem wandering around in her all together. Which is actually quite nice.Double that for Gina Gershon. Her character is quite unpleasant, but Gershon plays her quite pleasantly. And the fewer the clothes she has on, the better she is. And she has very few clothes on during the movie. So there is that. But she is a very likable actress, perhaps the most redeeming aspect of the movie.In a dreadful series of awfulness, there are two standouts First the tendency of Berkeley to splunk herself down on a car in ire, and Kyle MacLachlan with a sklopf of hair hanging down across his face most of the time. Very annoying.This move should be shown in college film classes as how not to make a film. "},{"Title":"Wrong film at the wrong time I guess","Date":"25 October 2005","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This film has been slammed by more people than possibly any other film. So, despite avoiding for the longest time, after beginning research into Paul Verhoeven' catalogue of films for film studies class, it was inevitable that I would have to see this film.'Showgirls' is clearly a Verhoeven film in many ways. It is overtly sexual visually that can only be his work and provides the subtle satire and critical analysis of contemporary America - if you wanna make it big you gotta gamble. However the film falls short on the filmmaker's perfect camera direction, a good movie score and the memorable characters of his previous (and some later) works. 'Robocop' is one of the most tight fitted and edgy Sci-Fi's with 'Total Recall' a good, original epic in its own right and 'Basic Instinct' before and 'Starship Troopers' are arguably some of the greatest films of the 90's. It's obvious from the start with its jumpy cuts, obscure camera shots and cheesy acting by the various protagonists that this isn't on par.However I fail to see why this film has been so burnt badly as it is. Having watched the man's classic Dutch 'Turkish Delight' amongst others so believe it or not, I was expecting MORE cross nudity from this film. Maybe its because I'm British, and here in England where we are far less conservative we feel less shocked when seeing the all-bare flesh of a naked women. Maybe its because this was far too serious against the new found Pulp Fiction fanatics that had spawned in the previous 6-12 months but whatever, it seems that this film isn't half as sleazy as other late night American television shows and the plot has far more to say than what meets the eye. As James Smith explains to the ever so naive Nomi No matter at the Cheetah (all stripper club) or at the Goddess (a far more fancy but still erotic dance club catering for the rich and famous) you still strip like a hooker. Perhaps this is not just an analysis of just Nomi's situation or even Vegas but of America where, whether a stripper on Playboy or a star singer like Britany Spears, a pretty girl in America gets on by because of her sexual identity. This is a powerful message that I got in the film and feel proud of but maybe it was too much for many Americans to handle. Perhaps this is also and analysis of Verhoeven who, after being promoted from Holland to Hollywood, he still makes the same sex and violence but just more glamour able (and successful). A parody of his career if you like.Whether you like this film will simply matter on your view of sex. If you firmly believe this should only be viewed in the bedroom, hated 'Basic Instinct' or you're not a fan of sex (the latter being my personal believe why so many Americans have scorned this movie) then you won't like it. However, if a naked woman on your TV screen doesn't get to your head too much and you can look past it throughout the film (which IS possible) you may just find this an OK movie. But not a great. "}{"Title":"That the script, acting, direction and story are all terrible is no surprise but the lack of sexual impact is a real failure","Date":"28 March 2005","Score":"8 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" With her eyes fixed firmly on the bright lights, Nomi hitches a ride into Las Vegas to pursue her dream of being a dancer. With her luggage stolen within seconds, Nomi finds herself alone until a kindly woman takes her in off the street. Luckily this woman happens to be a dresser at one of the big shows in town and, while stripping to pay the rent, Nomi gets to meet the movers and (literally) shakers within the business. It is not long before she starts to get some breaks and things look like working out for her; however, can she survive among the betrayal, bitchiness and excesses and keep her na√Øve, down to earth spirit? Ermmmm &#150; no, no she can't.How easy it would be for me to throw my hands up and attack all the easy targets in this messy shambles of a film; but I want to be fair to it. Baring in mind that it is a softcore drama with nudity in spades, is it any surprise that aspects like story, dialogue, script, direction and acting, all came a far second to the excessive nudity etc on display here. Needless to say these things are all terrible but what genuinely surprised me was how unsexy the whole affair was. It was delivered with all the emotional involvement of a lapdance &#150; in fact, no, scratch that, a good lapdancer makes you believe the illusion, here it just felt cold and distant. For the erotic genre this is the whole ballgame and to miss that target is to disappoint the audience you are going for in the first place. The whole film is so overblown that it becomes an unengaging meat wagon of women's bodies &#150; all of which look nice but really they didn't interest me after a short time. Of course it didn't help that the aforementioned aspects didn't work for a damn either, but this was the most surprising failure. The other failures were just greeted with resignation by me &#150; the script is awful, a story driven by lazy plot devices from the moment Nomi arrives in Vegas up to (and including) the final scene of the film. The dialogue is just as bad and is clunky at best, laughable at worst.With this to work with it is no wonder many of the cast struggle, but what is so wonderful is just how totally inept Berkley is. Her Nomi spends the film either smiling hopefully or storming off in a huff pushing things as she goes &#150; how we were expected to care a fig for this person I'll never know. What makes it worse is how remote and plodding she is as an actress; there seems to be nothing behind her eyes, no understanding of her character and no ability to make a person out of her words &#150; she can show me her T&A as many times as she wants but I've seen it all before and she quickly became a tired one-trick pony with nothing to offer. What was even more wonderful was her lack of irony or her total ignorance of the irony of her character being offered chances partly due to who she was sleeping with while at the same time she herself was allegedly having an affair with her direction. Add to that her OTT performance and laughable delivery, all topped up with her epileptic fit in a swimming pool and you've got one of the most inept things I've ever seen. Gershon does sultry lesbian better than anyone but other than her sizzling scenes, she can do nothing with the character &#150; even her girl/girl stuff seems lame thanks to her lack of chemistry with Berkley. Support from people like MacLachlan, Davi and a few others is OK but nobody can hold their heads up with this with any sense of pride.Overall this is as bad as people say but did we expect anything else. The excesses and bad aspects may provide some laughs and enjoyment but really it is hard to care or stay with it. Of course, for an erotic film, what was most surprising is just how unerotic it all is &#150; being sexy is not the same as crude excessive nudity at every turn &#150; sadly the film can't stop it and very soon I was staring at the screen about as detached from it as I could be. It was only the terrible turn from Berkley that made me unable to turn away &#150; like a rabbit in the headlights.

"},{"Title":"Love it or hate it (2015 review)","Date":"30 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" There are a good number of reviews made over the previous years, but I thought I'd add my input, 20 years after the release of this film.I'll explain why you should and should not watch this film, depending on who you are and what you like, and then you can decide for yourselves about it.Why you shouldn't watch it I Showgirls is not a film for everybody nor does it try to be. To this day, it is the highest grossing NC-17 film, in spite of being considered a financial mess for the studio that produced it. The very fact that it wasn't attempted to tone it down to get an R-rating, even though NC-17 is practically a financial death sentence, gives you the first clue about it. Vulgarity and swearing are commonplace across the film, naked bodies are recurrent, and sexual moments although not plentiful are all quite explicit and lasting.II There is no semblance of fable-like morality here, so don't scratch or try to find any. Due to the cultural background that the Western public (and I'd argue a sizable part of the non-Western one) has been imprinted with for generations, people expect every tale to end in a 'positive' note following paths where A) Either the conflict is resolved peacefully. (Turn the other cheek, violence is never justified) B) Good triumphs dramatically over evil when dialogue is rendered impossible. (The righteous champion must stand for what is right) C) Characters find redemption at last following a cumbersome road (Stick to your principles and/or purify yourself of your past sins). D) Acceptance and peace is found in light of the unsolvable situation. (This world is messed up but if I live a virtuous life, I have nothing to fear).Those are broadly the outcomes that people are programmed to expect and accept. They match the baggage of Christianity, of humanistic civil right defense, and democratic feel-good that composes the collective psyche of the XXI Century society.Showgirls is nothing like that, so if you're not capable of looking past these archetypes, don't bother watching it really, it's just going to anger you and annoy you.III The acting can feel over-the-top and artificial if we contrast them to what people appreciate nowadays.Elizabeth Berkley can seem quite dramatic in her performance, somehow being reminiscent of theater more than TV/cinema. If you can't get past that stylistic difference, then you might probably not enjoy it.If you have no qualms with the previous points, let me tell you now all the good this film has to offer.Why you should watch it?I Showgirls is never boring.The organization of the 2 hour film is very well done. The story never goes too slow nor too fast, although there might be moments where you feel as if the characters are acting bizarrely, you do get to live periods of 'action' (represented in choreography and physical exertion, chiefly Nomi's), and periods of 'rest' where they converse and have interesting exchanges.I'm an easily bored person, and I'm not foreign to the idea of doing a full stop in a film before the first hour if I feel I'm wasting my time. Showgirls never had me thinking I hope this ends soon or what a drag. Sex only happens technically one time only, so it's not a burnt gimmick, and though insinuation is recurrent, if you can treat it as a contextual feature rather than be shocked by it every time, it doesn't hinder the general story at all, and rather adds realism to it.II Showgirls treats the whole showbiz industry and the people around it, as well as their work and habits very realistically and accurately. I have been backstage in plays and dealt with people who are committed to this industry to know a tidbit, and except for the occasional odd event (Nomi suddenly jumping live her second day, which isn't entirely impossible in the industry anyway), the pressure, competitiveness, underhanded tactics to get ahead, as well as the stress and rush required during presentations are all there and are all perceivable by the audience.III Showgirls, simply put, shows you how the overwhelming majority of people around you, really are.They are not these incredibly insightful or scheming characters that sometime are shown in horror movies, thrillers, political dramas, who against all logic saw every angle and every turn and made a big plan about it. Except for one character you meet at the end, they're also not particularly 'evil' (heavily loaded concept to begin with) or vicious. And except for the one character that is victimized by the former, there are no good and virtuous people around either.These are people that take their lives as a situation given to them, care about themselves, try to get money and pleasure if they have a shot, but still take the chance to feel remorse, to tone down a bit their vice to feel right about themselves, and on overall are just reactive to the ambient values of the current society. If anything, they're terribly normal, which is something that might explain why people reject this film so much, getting to face something that is just their naked world instead of the fantastic/comedic/horrific (ultimately fake) story that takes their head off things.IV) If you have felt during your life somehow leaning towards cynicism, this movie will click just right with you, but also keeping a chance to surprise you. Which when you think about it, is quite the feat.I personally enjoyed Showgirls, and although I am not going to become the utmost defender of it, I feel as if it works for what it set out to be. Not perfect of course, but still 8/10.

Paul Verhorven is a director who in my opinion makes enjoyable guilty pleasure movies that you will be a idiot to take them seriously, but Showgirls may have been the biggest down fall from Paul Verhorven.The directing in this movie has to be the most dullest and the most uninspiring directing and that was hard for me to say that because this guy is a great director and he has made good movies before, but this movie takes his talent and throws it out of the window.The acting and the character's in the movie wasn't really all that well done, I didn't really buy into they characters because none of the actors give nothing with they performance and that's why in some scenes where a big drama happened and it didn't work because the actors give a lifeless performance that I didn't give a sh*t about.The writing in this movie has to be one of the worst writing I've seen since...well every bad movie with bad writing.

Of course, both films have reputations for being awful, both dominating the Razzies in their respective years- except Striptease, while not good, didn't really deserve the scorn. It was Showgirls that set the prejudice against nude dancer movies, and for a reason.Showgirls might have worked for me when I was 12- the women in this show lots, lots of breasts, some backs, and some, including the star, go full frontal. The dancing is sexy. But everything surrounding those scenes is poor, mediocre at best. This definitely didn't have the artistic merit to justify the gratuitous nudity- making this look like a cheap exploitation piece or simply a schoolboy's fantasy. The plot is thin, wherever it exists, borrowing from All About Eve. The acting, especially Elizabeth Berkley's, is awful. The dialogue is cheesy (I like having nice tits). The situations are unbelievable (she immediately pulls a knife on the guy who picks her up when she is hitchhiking). The dancing scenes may have erotic value and the women are beautiful; everything else is either excruciating or morbidly fascinating, like how you can't look away from a car wreck. Who knows, maybe it is possible to make a masterpiece film about strippers- this one, and Striptease, aren't it.

It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years.Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkeley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge.The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkeley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkeley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILERThis is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Esteharez shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

Others have defended this film as a brilliant satire of American culture along the lines of Starship Troopers.  But the battery of ludicrous sex scenes, flailing pudenda, and languorous lesbian kisses gives the game away.  Perhaps the crowning achievement of the Hollywood erotic-thriller genre, Showgirls unwittingly exposes it for what it really is an excuse to fill the screen with a few dozen pair of admittedly shapely and extremely well-lit breasts.

Verhoeven wanted to do a provoking film about the behind the scenes of the dazzling world of the big time shows. No problem. He grabs a wannabe (I'll show it all) star, gets a couple of good actors and a few dozens of nice bodies together, a poor excuse of a screenplay and... voila!  Showgirls is alive!Even in this magniere, this film is bad. Camp, yes for sure. Kitsch, also. But not a camp classic, just a show off for some really bad taste.Oh, there are good sides in this film. The beautifull bodies, for instance. The full frontals (did you people in the US got another version without Naomi's FFs? Funny, but it happens all the time, you know) some very Kitsch-y sex scenes (all-time kitsch classics, actually) and the camp atmosphere.Nothing more, though.

This film is brilliant, but obviously not for all tastes. If you've ever studied Sirk, seen Imitation of Life or Written On The Wind, you know where this film is coming from and why it is so darn great. It's a melodrama folks, and melodrama is a very strange genre that people either love or hate. To run around screaming that this movie is so bad that it's like a soap opera is pretty stupid, because it's supposed to be like a soap opera. That's what melodrama is. It's the framework of a dramatic text, but it is very overwrought, hence the term melodramatic. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you scream in shock, and in this case, it makes you think. Verhoeven is a director who, throughout his career of 40 years, has used melodrama as a device. It allows him to create distance and express bigger ideas by adding more layers of meaning to whatever insipid text he is working with. His first Dutch film to be released in the US, Turkish Delight, was a blatant rip-off of the popular US film Love Story that went on to win a foreign language Oscar. Through its use of melodrama it provided a distanced, critical view of hippies, free-love and the role of religion in a changing society. (Amsterdam had become a Hippie mecca by the 70's.) This was something that the American Love Story could never have conceived of doing. Showgirls is no different. This movie has humor but it is inappropriate to call it a satire. A more appropriate description would be to call it a fatalistic, socially critical melodrama with a twisted sense of humor.Bash Showgirls all you want. History will vindicate Verhoeven. (Though I don't think it will vindicate Hollow Man, the first film by Verhoeven that I would openly call hackwork--far worse than Showgirls-- yet even Hollow Man has a few tricks up its sleeve with its sly Dan White references.)

First of all it has a straight and fast-narrated story. Believe me, that's where most movies start to lag. The story begins from the very first scene and we learn that a girl in a shortage of money has come to Vegas to find a job as a dancer. This theme has an initial suspense in it which the script never lets it to fall down. Yet some may be bored by the dance scenes but personally I love dance and gaps made by dance sequences in films. From Godard's Band Apart which influenced the dance scene In Pulp Fiction to the Travolta's nice moves in Saturday Night Fever which is also an underrated film. Plus the group dances and choreographies are so fancy and erotic in Showgirls. My favorite one is when two main female characters participate on a stage show and the rivalry between them turns the dance moves into a sort of battle.About the eroticism in the movie, I think this is the aspect which has made everybody to give this title a low rating. But I really don't see Showgirl as a mere erotic picture. It has a story-teller script. The naked scenes are parts of the story. They are a part of the everyday life of characters and the environment surrounding them. Actually here is the point we can speak about the realism in the movie. Showgirls is a realistic movie, it's like a mirror that reflects the true hierarchy and competitions in the night club industry. But the kind of realism is not like Italian or French realism, it's Hollywoodian Realism. It does entertain you while giving you shocking facts about the subject.There are some great movies with similarities to Showgirls. First of all consider All about Eve, which was made in 1950 about the replacement of generations and rivalry among the Theatre superstars. Some say Showgirls is a remake of All about Eve in a modern entertainment industry like Vegas show business. But personally I don't agree with them, the characteristics of two main female Characters in these movies are different. Another close film to our topic is Casino made by M.Scorsese at the same year that Showgirls was produced. Both pictures are made in Las Vegas in splendid and fancy sets and locations, and both have an intensive plot concerned with cruel industries. The irony is that Casino was celebrated by critics and nominated for several awards whereas Showgirls was deemed trash and a worthless sexual fantasy. I think it has the name of Scorsese as the director its reception was different. Although some figures like Tarantino have applauded the movie.Boogie Nights by Paul Thomas Anderson is also near to showgirls. It was shot 2 years after Paul Verhoeven's movie and I don't know whether Anderson had seen the other movie or not but if you like Boogie Nights I strongly recommend you to see Showgirls.

And then get naked.If I could sum up Showgirls in one sentence it would be Not what you expect it to be. From the word go, Showgirls is unpredictable to say the least. There are a number of scenes which will have you attempting to predict an ending which any other movie would have gone for, but rejects the Hollywood templates and tells it's own, surprisingly compelling, story.That's not to say that it isn't swimming with hard-to-believe moments, most characters in the movie seem to have the mood swings of a person with bipolar disorder - the smallest unfortunate event sends the characters into thrashing emotional convulsions while a little good news sends them into giggling ecstacy. It's not necessarily a bad thing in the unusual, illogical world the film creates, but you will be well aware you're watching one-liner spouting cartoons instead of characters you can believe and relate to. Like many cult classics, though, (RoadHouse comes to mind), within a few scenes you'll be immersed in the world of offbeat, sassily-scripted 80s wise crackers.Of course, this paragraph is inevitable in this kind of movie, and my apologies to the entire female gender, but the real star of this movie is the large amount of female skin on show, and it most certainly delivers. While I don't believe any actor or actress should be cast for their body, Showgirls never fails to deliver some really stunning female figures. Of course this isn't of importance but it's the film's selling point.Indeed, contrary to what may be implied by the film's poster (or even the name), Showgirls portrays some strong, powerful and unpredictable women with deep and interesting histories, particularly the protagonist, whose character arc you will not even begin to predict. Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley) takes no prisoners and for once a mainstream film doesn't end in apologies and reunions.Much like the film's recurring theme, Showgirls gambles. Unfortunately not all gambles pay off and I believe this was completely slated by the mainstream critics, but if you're anything like me, this cult classic hits the jackpot.

Obviously, Verhoven wanted to paint a picture of Las Vegas and the kind of Americans drawn there as ugly and incredibly stupid. In this, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. It is actually fun to watch certain segments of this nightmare, as I happen to agree with Verhoven about Vegas and those who frequent it. I highly recommend it to lovers of truly awful cinema.

That movie happens to be 'Showgirls'. On the back of the video cover for this film it states  The team that tantalised you with the controversial 'Basic Instinct', is back to take you one step further. Yet I feel with Showgirls the 'team' took us one step too far! This film is widely known as 'one of the worst movies ever made', with Verhoeven regretting ever touching such a project. With its weird and bitchy story, empty characters and more onscreen 'flesh' than you could ever imagine, I would have to agree with the general consensus and say that Showgirls 'is the worst movie I have ever seen'.Nomi Malone is an ambitious young woman who has moved to Las Vegas looking to break into the fiercely competitive world of 'Showgirls'. But before she can make it as a dancer, she has to be become a stripper at the Cheetah Club, where she will do more than take her clothes off. If she wants to hit the big time, she has to be prepared to do anything......For a film that I hate, there is so much I want to say as to why I feel that way about it. The actors that were chosen for this movie have a lot to do with it. Its main star is Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley), who looked very raw to the acting game. Some positives for Elizabeth include the great body she has, and the wonderful dancing ability she portrays through her character. Yet she really does look like a dumb blonde in 'Showgirls', so naive in a very evil world. Berkley has continued to act (to my surprise) in such movies as 'Any Given Sunday' and 'The First Wives Club'.Nomi accidentally makes friends with Molly (Gina Ravera) who is one of the more likable characters in the movie. She is about to graduate from Fashion College, and works backstage on showgirls. Her character has something happen to her late in the movie that even I find too hard to mention. Another likeable character is James (Glen Plummer), who meets Nomi in a nightclub that he works in. She gets him fired for 'dancing with her'. James tries to win Nomi over in his personal life, and so she can help him in his quest to be a dancer, although he fails miserably in both aspects. The problem I found with 'James' was that his character is very hard to understand. Plummer is most recognised in the 1994 hit movie 'Speed', as the Jaguar owner.Yet this film has more characters which I despised, more than I liked. Crystal Connors (Gina Gershon) is the star attraction of the Showgirls show. She is also very bitchy, evil and demands he own way every time. I am one viewer who did not like her that much. I liked Gershon much more in the '97 action movie 'Face/Off'. Then take the character of Zack Carey (Kyle McLachlan), for the entire movie you think he is a good guy and that Nomi could do no worse than to have him as a partner, then he turns out to be just as bad if not worse than some of the other evil characters. McLachlan had a better role in HBO's 'Sex and the city'. Other people such as performers in the 'showgirls' and at the stripclubs all bring this movie down in my view.I can understand why Verhoeven took on 'Showgirls'. Its premise would have suited his sexual appetite, and you can see where he has put his own touches on it. I am certain that he would have wanted as much sex in 'Showgirls' as possible. Sadly the sex in this film became very dull after a while, with the 'female form' becoming something boring and unattractive. In fact you breathe a sigh of relief when you see the girls putting their clothes back on. Thankfully there were no references to the crucifix in Showgirls, a subject which I know Verhoeven is obsessed with.The screenplay for 'Showgirls' was written by Joe Eszterhas, whose script has some good areas. I enjoyed the whole area of the stripclub scene, and what it can involve, and how far a person will go to make it in the dancing arena. Yet there are some ordinary areas as well. The whole 'bitchy' feel came across too much, making this film for me a very evil one. Yet the story's characters were very shallow, with more of them hateable than likeable. Some of the blame has to lie with Eszterhas.All in all, 'Showgirls' is a movie I feel was a waste of time watching. It sexually exploits and degrades women, treating them as if they are not real people. It also shows dancing to be an 'eye for an eye' kind of industry, something which would distract new upcomers to the dancing profession. There are many moments in this movie that I found very hard to understand or watch, and once you have watched it you will understand what I mean. Finally, I want to mention that some of my friends have experienced what it is like to be in a stripclub. From their description, it sounded 'classy and fun'. Yet after watching this garbage, you could be turned of the by idea of ever going into a 'stripclub'.CMRS gives 'Showgirls' 1 (Bad Film) "},{"Title":"Naked Women????

The first time because I wanted to relax and watch a movie. That was accomplished. The next time I watched it was to see if I had slept through it the first time, and missed all of the material that brought on the negative comments about it. It turns out that I had not slept through it. It actually kept me quite entertained.I find that too many people go to a movie and are disappointed that someone dared to make a movie differently than what they themselves would have done. If you do not like a movie... don't go back. By complaining about what you saw, you have generated possibly the largest number of comments on this website about any movie ??! True or not, it did not prevent my enjoying it.Anyone that asks me about the movie (that has not seen it yet) is told that I enjoyed it. I tell them that it follows a young dancer through apparent steps that dancers go through, if they are trying to reach the big time in Las Vegas. Factual or not, we see what we like to think is the way it is, which turns out to be what you would not recommend for your daughter, or any one else's daughter. The film certainly does not glorify the Showgirl career. I tell them that there is a lot of nudity above the waist, as one would expect behind the wings of a Vegas theater. I also inform them that a rape scene is involved, and if any of these things bothers them, and will ruin their day, then they might not enjoy the movie.If nudity of any nature bothered anyone of those people that have written a review of this film, then why did they go to see it? Did they think that Las Vegas showgirls wear long john undergarments under those bikinis and G-strings? I also note with interest, their comments about how they get used to the nudity; how they accept nudity as the uniform of the dancers. Nudists or Naturists have been telling us this for many years. People that stand to have personal gains from our overreactions to bare skin (undergarment and clothing manufacturers, magazine and book publishers, film producers, internet providers, etc.) have cultivated this line of thought (fear?) for a long time.Because of the discussions of this film's merits and qualities, I suspect that the VCR tape and DVD market has reflected it. Hmmm.. brings to mind the old addage about hoping your new book would be banned in Boston, so it would increase it's sales. Those that think this film was a financial failure are sadly mistaken, and it is still not over.Use your mind! Decide for yourself!

Did an intelligent man (and a Jesuit scholar--a doctorate in fact) just suddenly become an imbecile? Of course not.

From the very start, this is a laugh-out-loud mess. A lot of the blame falls on Elizabeth Berkley's manically bad performance. She goes from calm to over the top anger without nary a pause or nuance, and it happens in almost every scene she's in. It's a turn worthy of Scarface. She is cute, though.Without doubt, the real culprits are Eszterhas and Verhoeven, the creative team behind the much better Basic Instinct. Almost nothing in Showgirls works. The tone is sometimes campy, sometimes erotically dark, and sometimes big Hollywood spectacle. If they would have nailed the tone, I think audiences would have liked it, regardless of the bad press.

A full 25% of IMdb votes give it a 1, which is ludicrous. They either never saw the film, or were simply jumping on the bandwagon of bad reviews. It isn't perfect, but it is well-written, directed, and acted, and makes a very striking commentary on a fringe lifestyle, that of Las Vegas entertainment. It variously examines trust, betrayal, friendship, competition, boundaries, justice, greed - and does it in a way that you should never take too seriously. Elizabeth Berkely as Nomi is great, and you can see she really exposed herself (pun intended) for this role, physically and emotionally.  Took a lot of guts! If you are offended by female nudity, you won't like this film, because there's lots of it. But it fits with the storyline.CAUTION -- SPOILERS --The film starts and ends the same way - Nomi is hitching out of a town, and is picked up by the same guy in a pickup, who the first time steals her luggage, and the second time, perhaps a year or two later, drives down the road with her switchblade at his throat, demanding I want my suitcase. In the meantime, Nomi gets work first as a lap-dancer, then in the chorus of a prestigous LV show, sleeps her way into the good graces of the show's manager, the star played by Gina Gershon tries to seduce her, unsuccessfully, she pushes Crystal down stairs after one act and inherits the star role and becomes a LV hit,her roommate is brutally raped and beaten by her hero, a famous singer and his two men, Nomi gets revenge and beats the snot out of him after she is told she CANNOT call the cops. Eventually this all makes her realize that she really is a prostitute, which she had denied, and leaves town presumably for a better life.Some say Elizabeth Berkely became blacklisted in Hollywood after this film, because in many ways it comes off as a soft porn film. Maybe she can't act, but in this film she was just great. Her range of emotions, her hot-headedness, and of course her beauty. And, the scene where she beats the snot out of the dastardly rapist is great, and her expressions are perfect in her outrage.

Paul Verhoeven and Joe Esterhaz decided to team up again to take the envelope-pushing sex and nudity they brought to the screen in Basic Instinct to its logical conclusion by making a mainstream movie that would show as much flesh and sex as it wanted and would not settle for a simple R rating. Showgirls was meant to be a revolution in filmmaking that ended up being a punchline instead. So what happened? Well, the biggest flaw with the film is its star, Elizabeth Berkeley. One of the unfortunate drawbacks to making a movie with excessive nudity is that most established actors won't go near it, meaning Verhoeven had to set his sights a tad low. She really tries but she is not even remotely believable as a tough-as-nails drifter. Every time she tries to act tough the results are hilarious whether she's putting the smackdown on a rapist, pulling a switchblade on a man in a truck, or beating the tar out of a basket of fries.The only thing worse than watching her act streetwise is watching her dance. Characters gush over how she's a great dancer with such raw talent despite the fact that her movements are often sloppy, herky-jerky, and in some cases, resemble an epileptic fit. This all comes to a head in the ridiculous pool sex scene, where she flails and flops around like a fish on dry land. Then again the very nature of the film likely scared away any actresses with true dancing ability so you take what you can get, I suppose.Not that she has a lot to work with. Her character, Nomi Malone, is mean, nasty, and prone to violent outbursts even before she gets corrupted by stardom. She has little to no backstory so it's never really explained why she's like this. Even more baffling is that people are willing to help her as she treats them like dirt. She nearly assaults Molly, the first person to reach out to her, and rewards her hospitality by ranting and raving like a lunatic. She mouths off frequently to her sleazy boss at the strip club and never gets fired. Then the movie has the gall to play her refusal to put ice on her nipples as a show of integrity.The rest of the cast is pretty solid despite being asked to deliver some terrible lines. Kyle MacLachlan is good as the scummy boyfriend, though he deserves an Oscar for maintaining composure in the pool scene. Robert Davi is dependable despite the absurd misogynistic dialogue he's given. Gina Ravera, the only likable character in the film, Molly, is decent. Gina Gershon definitely looks like she's having a blast.I don't know what to make of Verhoeven's direction here. He's proved he can direct but yet he also somehow accepted the pool scene. Not only is it Berkeley's worst performance, you can clearly see MacLachlan in tighty-whities in one shot (Hooray for double standards!). As for the rest of Berkeley's bad acting, he could probably only do so much. He also makes a HUGE rookie mistake during the marbles scene by having the actress complain of a broken knee despite falling flat on her back. A lot of people also seem to suffer compound fractures in this movie despite the absence of protruding bone.The writing is so bad that I am baffled that MGM paid 4 million for this thing. The dialogue is pointlessly vicious and about as subtle as a brick through a plate-glass window. The characters are all vile backstabbers (except Molly).Nomi, as written, is too stupid to live. She leaves her suitcase with a stranger while going off to gamble. Despite being street smart, she's never heard of Versace or an MBA. She tries to hide her past and refuses to give out her SSN when hired as a showgirl, which not only would prevent her from getting paid but raises serious questions about this movie's timeline. In the film we see five or six performances of her show so does that mean she got hired, became the understudy, and sabotaged Cristal in a week? Nomi gets found out rather quickly and even if she hadn't, the lack of SSN would've prevented her from getting her first paycheck so that gives us maybe two or three weeks. The movie ends with her hitchhiking out of Vegas, despite the fact that she could likely afford at least a used car, just so she can implausibly end up with the guy who stole her suitcase at the beginning.There is really no point to the James character. He's set up as the love interest only for him to immediately drop her and go into a shotgun wedding with one of her co-workers at the strip club. After ONE date. It's all so rushed and clumsily written that it feels like padding. Though it was almost worth it to hear him utter the immortal line, Everybody got AIDS and s**t, and see him verify that Nomi is on her period.Finally, there is the controversial rape scene. It is unnecessary, disturbing, and cruel but yet it's one of the few scenes that works. It's mainly unnecessary because Molly is willing to have sex and the movie has already gone into overkill establishing Vegas as a terrible place with terrible people. So what was the point? To get Nomi to leave Vegas? Couldn't they have found another way? Nevertheless, it is satisfying seeing Nomi get revenge on her behalf (bad acting aside).The end result is a film that's impossible to take seriously, but certainly never dull. It's been said that Madonna was one of the original choices to play Cristal Connors and Jenny McCarthy was seriously in contention to play Nomi, so it could've been a LOT worse.

It's probably the greatest camp classic in 20 years. Some people think that the director Paul Verhoeven decided to make a subversive art film without telling anyone. The end result is stuill hilarious and highly entertaining.The plot of showgirls is simple. Nomi Malone (Geddit? Played by Elizabeth Berkely) is a young mysterious drifter who after hitching a ride to Vegas finds her self down on her luck. She is taken in by Molly (Gina Ravera) the films only remotely sympathetic character. Even though Nomi dreams of being a showgirl, she takes a job as a stripper at the local cheetah club where everyone is a gynecologist. Cristal Conners (Gina Gershon), the star of some klassy topless revue takes a liking to Nomi and gets her on her show. Even though Nomi's only real dance training is giving spastic lap dances, she manages to end up as Cristal's understudy. What happen's next is basically All About Eve updated to the 90s with more gratuitous nudity, weird dance numbers and bonding over puppy chow.Showgirls is actually a solidly constructed film if you ignore the plot, the dialogue and most of the acting. The worst acting is from poor, poor Elizabeth Berkeley. Her attempts at sexy and seductive come across as confused. The poor girl can't even eat a hamburger convincingly. She also for some reason decides to play Nomi as someone who randomly breaks out in spastic convulsions when giving a lapdance, having sex or at the club. On the other hand, Gina Gershon is hilarious and amazing as Cristal Conners. She was probably the only on in the cast that was in on the joke and it really shows, darlin'. Even the best actor can't save some of the dialogue. Apparently Joe Esterhas was paid $2 million dollars for this script. That's $1,999,999 more than it's worth. The dialogue is so stilted and melodramatic. There are some unbelievable lines. My personal favorite is Man, everybody got AIDs and s**t although It's Ver-sayse and You got low self-esteem baby, you're a fantastic f**k are up there. Showgirls is an amazingly terrible movie that somehow ends up being hugely entertaining. The dialogue and acting result in some great mostly unintentional laughs. The whole thing is so over the top there is no way to take it seriously.

Showgirls has so much pointless nudity that you become desensitised to it, meaning the film is reduced to its desperate performances and threadbare plot. But the movie inhabits its own little world where people talk and act like these characters - certainly, it has no basis in reality. The plot, which I suspect Eszterhas wrote on the back of a napkin, feels like a recycled Flashdance or All About Eve but with the adult content turned up to eleven.Gershon has fun as the bisexual (naturally!) star of the Strip but MacLachlan hams his way through the picture, resulting in the most ludicrous and spasmodic sex scene in cinema history. I got the feeling that Verhoeven and Eszterhas were coasting on their previous success with equally shameless murder-mystery Basic Instinct but this lacks any of that film's sense of drama, chemistry or tension. This is a hackneyed and cheesy glam-fest, offering little to the average viewer besides laughable dialogue, a dreadful soundtrack, a stupid script and no sense of self-worth at all.

No one should publicly admit to liking Showgirls. There's very little to like about it. Yet I still do. And, looking at some of the other comments on here, I'm not the only one (perhaps there's a secret 'Fight Club-like' organisation out there somewhere for people like us?).It's about a young woman who drifts into Las Vegas with dreams of being a dancer. She ends up being a stripper. However, her fortunes don't stay that way for long, as she's offered a role in a top Vegas casino's show... which involves taking her clothes off.In case you've never heard of this film, it does involve a lot of female nudity. Now, this naturally attracted a lot of criticism of the film being sexist. And, in short, it is. However, isn't that the point? We're getting a look into an industry (whether it be the stripping industry, the showgirl industry, or even the film industry) which is heavily male-dominated. It's run by rich middle-aged men who get to decide which young 18-21 year old females get the parts. Of course there's going to be a heavy element of sexism and quite a fair share of sleaze involved.I won't try to defend Showgirls and say things like 'the nudity empowers the women,' because that would probably be untrue (and rather pretentious). But I will say that the nudity is at least valid. Making a film without nudity about a subject involving strippers and erotic dancers would be like making a film about the Second World War without soldiers.It's all pretty cheesy stuff. I don't know whether that was the film-makers' intentions when they made it, but that's the end result. Everything is very dramatic. The lead characters dances overly-dramatically, walks overly-dramatically and, if you look closely, even eats a hamburger overly-dramatically. It's kind of like the acting quality you'd expect from an afternoon soap (but with more nudity, obviously).However, if there's one redeeming feature that can genuinely be talked about, it's Gina Gershon, who plays the femme fatale 'Cristal Connors.' She seems to revel in flitting between evil and seductively charming and is a joy to watch when it comes to baddies.I don't think anyone should recommend Showgirls to anyone, without knowing what sort of films they're into. You'll either love it or throw a brick at the TV. Best to just tell people you hate it until you meet up with them in some underground car park with the rest of the Showgirls fans. Remember, the first rule about liking Showgirls is that you DO NOT admit to liking Showgirls.

She auditions to work at a big-time Las Vegas strip show, where Gina Gershon is the reigning diva. Gershon seems to have a hard-on for Berkley from the first time they meet. However, she doesn't allow that attraction to get in the way of her diva-like attitude. During the movie, Berkley's character pushes Gershon down a flight of stairs, and she becomes the reigning Las Vegas diva.There is plenty of nudity, including full front and back nudity by Berkley. Her boobs were the best actors in the movie. Unfortunately for her, she is in the same category as Annalyne McCord and Kari Wuhrer - two other beautiful actresses who can't act. They're nice to look at, but when they open their mouths, it's apparent five seconds later that they got where they are because of their looks and nothing else.I gave this movie a 3-star rating.

But this tale of Nomi and her exploits in the city of sin is one of my personal favorites. The story is insane, the characters are monsters, and the millions of dollars spent on sets and costumes push this insane monstrous spectacle into a unique realm of film the glittering nightmare. In some ways, this film is almost a horror film, and if its final twenty minutes had been spent in an orgiastic spree-killing, I think no one would have been surprised. The texture of the story is brutal, foul, and nasty -- but somehow Nomi always manages to be innocent, beguiling, sweet and seductive.As for specifics Gina Gershon will never have a character as great as her character in this film. The whole lesbian-lite thing that she played with in the 90s comes to a head in this film, and although (spoiler? I think not) she and Nomi do not have full-on sex in this film, they come about as close to f***ing each other without f***ing each other as possible.Vegas is portrayed as a stripmall with tourists. The hotels are reduced to a front door with bellhops, an auditorium with strippers pretending to be dancers, and one or two suites with a view of other hotels and casinos. The city's inhabitants live in ramshackle run-down tenements, and you'll see alleys more often than real streets in this film's dark take on the town.Nomi herself is a cypher. She is, to put it charitably, batshit insane and fragile to the point of being a danger to herself. She stages meltdowns at the smallest inconveniences, pulls a switchblade when threatened, beats people like a thug, and her simulated sex acts are so obscene that it makes the real sex scenes seem lame in comparison. Nomi is also innocent, loving, loyal, funloving, and beautiful. There is something about her body (and you'll see her body, I hope this isn't a spoiler) that no other young actress has ever really done.I think that's one of the historical points of this film The actress Elizabeth Berkeley had just come out of many years as a teenybopper sweetheart, so seeing her take so joyfully to this hooker/lesbian romp was very unexpected. Her career was to have been destroyed by this film, we were told twenty years ago -- told wrongly. Berkeley took this role and set it on fire, and her portrayal of Nomi is one of the best things ever filmed.Other performances to watch Glenn Plummer is great in this film. Kyle McGoughlin is so sleazy you'll want to leap into the screen and slap him in the face, except that you'll end up with cocaine and suspect sexual fluids on your hands. Robert Davi is sexy and slinky and works a line between abusive sexist and huggable teddy bear. Gina Ravera is the friend you wish you'd make on your first day in Las Vegas.All in all, I can't recommend this film highly enough. Of course, I'm giving it an 8 instead of a 10 because it has a few flaws.

While it's scored very well and has a number of interesting characters, the film has the inevitable feeling you're watching someone's masturbatory fantasies or their wet dream. To be exact we are watching Joe Eszterhas's masturbatory fantasies/wet dream. It's a little awkward. The story is actually interesting, I thought, even though many people only care about the massive amounts of TnA. A book I own called Mr. Skin's Skintastic Video Guide The 501 Greatest Movies for Sex & Nudity on DVD says that Showgirls has over sixty scenes with breasts making it Mr. Skin's all time favorite film without a doubt. Showgirls has been notoriously panned by critics since it's release. In my eyes, all it is is a glossy, big budget exploitation film. It's a porno with a storyline, movie stars, and a purpose.The plot Nomi Malone (Berkley) is hitchhiking in Nevada and after she gets robbed of all her belongings she meets Molly (Ravera). Molly is nice enough to let Nomi live with her for a while till she gets her life on track. With the help of Molly, Nomi gets a job at a sleazy strip club called Cheetah's Topless Club. Molly also introduces Nomi to Cristal Connors (Gershon), the biggest showgirl in Nevada.Right of the bat, Nomi doesn't like Cristal due to her snotty remarks and smartass tone. Nomi see Cristal and her boyfriend Zach (MacLachlan) come into The Cheetah one night. By forcefulness from Nomi's strict boss (Davi), Nomi gives Zach a lap dance and both develop feelings for each other. The rest of the film is Nomi's struggle to become a respectable showgirl in the Vegas light.Showgirls delivers a hell of a lot of backstory from Nomi's life. With this being advertised as a sleazefest, NC-17 rated film having lots of backstory is actually kind of nice. I liked the character development, and especially like Kyle MacLachlan's character in the film. MacLachlan also starred in a thriller called The Trigger Effect. A film many hated, but I couldn't help but like.The film is worth it for the amusement factor, and the fact you can see beautiful women like Berkley and Gershon. Showgirls is entertaining, but still it doesn't really come to the level of being good. It's main focus are without a doubt the female's breasts and butts. You can only look at that so much and then it becomes uninteresting.Director Paul Verhoeven, director of Basic Instinct, Robocop, and Starship Toopers didn't take too much of a career leap directing this. Basic Instinct was almost as perverted as this film in a way. Bottom line Showgirls has entertaining sites, sounds, actresses, and production values, but the material runs thin quickly and becomes drab around the eighty minute mark.Starring Elizabeth Berkley, Kyle MacLachlan, Gina Gershon, Gina Ravera, Robert Davi, and Alan Rachins.

It's entire subject value had eyebrows lifting everywhere. The theme itself was a lure to many boys and men to rush to the theatre halls. The MPAA had a difficult time in rating the movie due to it's high sexually graphic nature presentation. I for sure had never seen so many women roam around topless so casually in a movie. No commercial movie to that day had I ever seen nudity depicted in a casual manner. I assume not many directors had the courage to do what Paul Verhoeven had attempted. He surely set a new standard and trend for cinema. But is is unfortunate that this did not become a long term frenzy. Without a doubt he made a daring movie which has gone beyond the realms of conventional cinema. Many would regard it as a true classic. The reason for this being that no other movie has chartered this territory even in the past 15 years.Paul Verhoeven is a competent director. Prior to his career in Hollywood he made movies on the genre of war and erotic natured movies. However I would rate his Hollywood career being his best. His first 2 movies 'Robocop' and 'Total Recall' were sci-fi. After that he made the box office hit 'Basic Instinct'. It's a surprising transition to move from sci-fi to erotic thrillers. But I guess it proves his versatility. 'Showgirls' obviously happened due to the success of 'Basic Instinct'. His collaboration with writer Joe Esterharez returned to the screen in full glare. Joe is a great writer and has always projected the different views of female empowerment in his novels. However the one flaw with 'Showgirls' is the script. Joe's one complaint with the movie was that he felt that sex and nudity camouflaged the small details in his novel. This made the plot appear thin and vague. The audiences admired the movie less for the plot but appreciated Elizabeth Berkley performance. Mario Kassar is the executive producer this time round and also produced 'Basic Instinct' too. 'Showgirls' does not manage to recreate the magic of 'Basic Instinct'. But both movies are are different and the same team perhaps felt that this would be a profitable venture. The director manages the theme very well. Being a originally a outsider from the industry, he has brought life in to the movie with his creative skills and individual knowledge.The movies central theme is on Las Vegas showgirls. Rather than giving the movie the title 'strippers', 'Showgirls' was more of a respectable title. Vegas is renowned for it's casinos and gambling industry and employs a large number of people. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is also a wealthy state. The movie does not intend on exposing the seedy side but rather concentrates on showing the journey of a woman who is enthusiastic to become a high level showgirl. Many people she encounters throughout the movie are self centred and manipulative, but her character too has many negative qualities. Elizabeth Berkley gives an honest performance. Her dancing abilities and acting skills are at their highest potential. Her portrayal as a ambitious and ruthless individual is very convincing. However she is not entirely a selfish person. She possesses feelings and demands respect like others too. Her performance is very inspiring and the manner in which she carries herself on screen is very professional. All that being said I would give her 10/10 for body exposure. SPOILERS Nomi Malone played by (Elizabeth Berkley) hitches a ride to Las Vegas. Her intentions are clear from the outset. She aims to become a popular Showgirl. A clothes designer Gina Revere lets her stay with her in her trailer. After enquiring at a few clubs and strip bars, Nomi gets the opportunity to dance at the Cheetah club. Robert Davi is the manager. Without wasting any time she becomes a professional dancer and catches the attention of everybody including Zack (kyle Mullikan) the entertainment manager and Crystal Conner s) Gina Gershon. Later she becomes lucky and gets the opportunity to audition for a showgirl position at the Stardust Hotel. She realises that it is not too easy and to become a high class dancer is very competitive. Her first dance is based on a volcano theme show. She electrifies on stage and becomes the highlight and talk of the town immediately. She becomes the media and people's favourite instantly. After spending a intimate night with Zack, she receives the lead position in a show. This upsets Crystal and she threatens Zack. This creates a conflict between Crystal and Nomi. After the show Nomi pushes Crystal down a flight of steps. This secures her position in the long term and leads to better things. However her friend Gina has a horrid encounter with her idolised singer, which makes Nomi think twice about her career and what consequences may occur if associating with the wrong people. END OF SPOILERThis is Paul Verhoeven's less intellectual movies, as the content level is low in contrast to his previous movies. He gives an alternate view of his understanding of the entertainment business in Las Vegas. Under the glossy interiors lies a world that is full of people that are self centred, selfish and corrupt. It is awkward that Nomi feels strange when others behave towards her in the same manner. I could not understand why Estehares shows Nomi's struggle as being too simple. She had to too easy for her. But I was convinced with her Short term struggles and I'm sure that many women may be able to relate to her character. The movie progresses at a moderate rate but the second hour is more productive as Nomi's character develops in to a complex phase. There are many dance sequences in the movie. They are pictured on a extravagant level.

Verhoeven really over sells the product. It might've helped a bit if Showgirls was marketed as a two hour porn, but nope, it is determined to be a fictional film. As repulsive as it looks, the film is not completely dry of entertainment value. The (for lack of a better euphemism) dance numbers are hot s**t. It is certainly very demanding on Elizabeth Berkly. If only she had spent as much time with an acting coach as she did with her dance choreographer. She delivers most of her lines like an infuriated loon, for no reason. By the time we find out why her character is so angry, it is way too late. Exposition comes at the beginning of a movie, not in the last twenty minutes. Quite frankly, nobody in the cast is a respectable character. Showgirls settles for being superficially entertaining. It doesn't even attempt to make its overlarge ensemble of characters into people that we want to spend time with. The screenplay comes with a rushed ending that leaves so much unexplained. It almost opens the door for a sequel, and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if Verhoeven had that in mind. Little does he realize that he has sold us way too much already. Some of it is entertaining in a lobotomized way, but the rest of it is pretty gross. I can probably recommend Showgirls as a two hour porn, but if you even consider treating it as a motion picture, you are barking up the wrong leg.

Director Paul Verhoeven uses bright vibrant colors to offset the drabness of Nomi's inner world; he wraps her in a cold dense fog of desperation and hopelessness. The film is constructed around her vague perceptions and undefined suffering as she spirals deeper into the vortex of an untreated mental illness. She is devorsed from a successful businessman and has a child but this seemingly perfect life is kept afloat by surface tension, this precarious balance of her emotional thermodynamics. Nomi becomes isolated from the world, detached from others and alone in a crowd, when she speaks it seems reflexive and passive, her physical actions pre-programmed and manufactured. When she has an affair with Cristal Connors, the star of Goddess, her husband's colleague, she is victimized because he takes advantage of her weakened emotional state. Verhoeven films the tryst without love, using the cold steel bed frame to create stark right angles, the physical act very mechanical. The rusting intertwining pipes and hulking steel of the factories and shipyards are painted in bright living colors while she is dressed in dull greens or black, breathing life into this static non-living matter. Verhoeven shoots in medium long shots with empty space between characters, separating them from each other with expertly fabricated compositions. Nomi is ultimately lost; diminishing in the foreground while a giant smokestack vomits yellow poison.

Actually this movie is more frank than these people; whereas it presented its point of view without any pedantry at all. And its point of view, for any dumb didn't understand it yet, is to SHOW (and it's a case where the movie makers were so truthful to their cause !). It is unruly commercial movie. And I don't think that its makers should be ashamed of themselves, since they spared no effort to present their goods, the same old goods, however so pure this time and without big stars. The thing is the final product couldn't be serious or funny, having nothing for the critics or the connoisseur viewer (and maybe not much for the usual viewer as well!). So as a movie about the hidden world of strip clubs it is catchy but with little to present. As a thriller it's comic. As a remake of (All About Eve) it's a bit sleazy but Hot !

However, she was maybe so strict when she selected this one, thinking that this would make her a number 1 Hollywood star, or another Sharon Stone, unfortunately the movie didn't hit the mark that Basic insect (for the same writer and director) did, and she didn't have yet roles as big or better (she didn't even have the chance to make a sequel !).Without much ado, we all know that the only rich thing here was the dances.

Throw away all formulaic commercial stories, past and present -- this one is going where no man has gone before. How many intense alpha male conflicts have we seen on film over the years? It's about time we had a really intense one about alpha females. We start out seeing these characters as fascinating female captives of the business of pleasing men -- but it's the gradually unveiled reality of their underlying competitiveness and forcefulness that turns out to be most intriguing. The writer and director understand women on a deep level -- the rules of mortal combat are very different for females. There's a wonderfully developed psychology to this one-of-a-kind mano-a-mano movie and, for those who have some knowledge of psychology, it presents a surprising degree of veracity -- especially for what was generally regarded as a skin show. And, oh yes, it IS a skin show -- a superb one -- certainly one of the great cinematic paens to the female breast! But this turns out to be a very serious film after all. Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon both turn in fascinating, absorbing performances. The movie went to some expectedly dark places and a lot of viewers just couldn't handle the juxtaposition of the dark with the erotic. I think the ending needs a bit of a re-edit -- way too much denouement for me. But this one is a keeper in my book.

One can't finish this film without thinking that most Elizabeth's Berkley's acting is done by her breasts and that the dialogue was clearly slapped on in the last minute simply as an after thought to the dominating focus on the strip, sex and dance sequences which in themselves focus only on the physical not the thematic.I really couldn't stand this film (and I'm not gay!) There is nothing in this movie which one can take away other than an erection and that sadly does not make a good film. I would argue that this picture does have the potential to be a camp classic if it were not for the obsession with nudity, the director has done more then make a point he has just enjoyed watching Elizabeth Berkley exploit her very attractive physique! As a result of this the film loses all credibility.I think the best example to reflect its glaring faults is to compare it to the ultimate camp classic, Dirty Dancing. Dirty Dancing avoids the easy route, nudity and extensive sex scenes, the suggestioin is made without the actual physical displayal of flesh and it is that which makes the film good. Showgirls doesn't have that simply because of the director's desire to make the film a strikingly unsubtle sex film.Thus the film is awful and really should be left in past or moved to the top-shelf with the x- rated pornos! I'm very happy to say that once is enough for me! Do yourself a favour and watch something with more integrity and perhaps a little more respect for women.

Director Verhoeven and Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas (Basic Instinct, Flashdance, Nowhere to Run) tries to be make this film extremely erotic and provocative but doesn't come even close. It's probably the least sexiest movie ever made. Although NC-17 rating, the film has. I felt it's unfair rating of the movie. I seen worse R Rated movies than this one.

But Showgirls isn't always fun to watch, especially when an key character gets raped towards the end. She's the only likable character in the film and it is played by Revera. MacLachlan gives an surprisingly stiff performance in this film. Glenn Plummer's role an ambitious wanna-be dance teacher is good but his dialogue suffers as well. Only Robert Davi's role as the owner of the Cheetah Club and Gershon's role in the movie. Davi and Gershon are the only ones in the film has any real fun in the movie. The Highlight of the film is the odd relationship between Berkley and Gershon & The dance sequences are well done as well. Too bad, director Verhoeven made this film way too seriously. When he was making it. He thought he was making an high class Drama but instead he made an unintentional comedy at best. But Verhoeven did tried his best as well. Showgirls isn't an boring movie.

Gina Gershon and Kyle MacLachlen do a good job with what they were given to work with.

The way to the top isn't easy. She has a bonk the right guys, use the best drugs, and shove the right leading showgirls down the stairs of the dressing room so Nomi can take their place. The three steamy scenes of the movie consisted of Nomi showing her breasts to a Vegas impresario, a wild sex scene in a pool (Nomi looks like a fish out of water, literally) and a brief lesbian kiss between Nomi and her main competition, Cristal Conners (Gina Gershon).Not a bad movie, if you have nothing better to watch.

So much so, I fell out of my seat laughing.  Consider when one of the dancing females falls on stage and cries out in horrific pain My knee, my knee, oh my God, my knee!

He has already done such movies before.  The story of the main character, disappointingly played by Elizabeth Berkeley, and her life in Las Vegas, could have been presented in an interesting and appealing manner, but the problem here is the terrible script.  It lacks interest and originality, maintaining a continually monotonous pace in which characters remain mediocre because there is no plot interest.  I don't really understand why Eszterhas is one of the highest paid writers in Hollywood.Verhoeven gives us a combination of `Flashdance,' `A Chorus Line,' and music of the 40's that results in a movie that isn't artistic or interesting.  The erotic elements are poorly handled here.  The director seems barely in control.As for the acting in this movie, there isn't much to say, except that I'm really disappointed that the nice girl in `Saved by the Bell' would have agreed to take on such a sleazy role.  I hope Elizabeth Bentley will do better next time. Overall, the movie is a disappointment.  I expected a dramatic story about Las Vegas, perhaps a description of the dancer's discontentment with her job.  I can understand that people like the movie because it presents a lot of naughtiness and naked bodies and such.  That might have worked if the movie had had a good plot.

It is not a documentary, not a romance, and not really a drama. It is more like opera or Shakespeare, where knowing the story ahead of time, or having seen it before, makes it even more enjoyable to watch (I hate opera, by the way, but if operas were staged as dynamically and erotically as this movie, I would change my attitude). The central character here, Nomi, in many ways reminds me of William Munny in Unforgiven. She is an archetypal outlaw, unapologetic about past and present transgressions of other people's rules, but with a very precise moral compass of her own, a compass which sets the direction of the entire story arc, and which allows her to triumph over much smarter and more powerful people. She went to Las Vegas and won herself.I rented the DVD mainly to watch the dancing. Because of the many poor reviews I planned to fast forward through the rest of the film. But to my surprise the whole movie proved excellent, and I would happily watch it again. This rates it 8/10 in my view -- higher than the 6/10 I rate Unforgiven, which I did enjoy but have no desire to watch again, and worlds higher than the 2/10 I gave to the offensively self-contradicting and self-defeating Moulin Rouge (the blood in Moulin Rouge is obscenely out of place in that frenetic cartoon; the blood in Showgirls is part of the story -- underneath the makeup and the ruthlessness are people who bleed).And the dancing is great. An actress can fake being an astrophysicist or a lawyer. She can't fake being a dancer. Elizabeth Berkley is astonishingly good, both as an accomplished dancer, and at giving the impression of being a mostly unschooled natural talent, adept at picking up moves quickly (I photographed dancers for 7 years, and even the most talented still have to work and practice hard). Gina Gershon is not quite on that level as a dancer, but she is equally good in her role. The ongoing confrontation between the two women is mythic in scale, and ties the movie together perfectly. It makes me wonder what went on behind the scenes at Delphi, and in the goddess temples of the ancient world. Whatever expectations you might bring to this movie, try to set them aside. You still might not like it, but accepting the film on its own terms certainly worked for me.

I mean, a naive girl who wants to 'succeed' in Vegas and ends up as a fancy stripper...come on! The only thing that puzzles me is what her original plans for making a living in Vegas were...The reason why the film was highly anticipated was that it was rumoured to become a $50 million porn flick. However, the biggest problem was that the sex and nudity, as they were eventually brought to us, simply were not extreme enough to pull in the punters. So it was given an NC-17 rating in the States, but cutting out a few seconds provided it with an R-rating. 'Turkish Delight', which Verhoeven had made little more than 20 years before 'Showgirls' (and which was voted 'Best Dutch Film of the Century' by Dutch audiences) was more explicit, but also more inventing, daring and erotic.However, 'Showgirls' is not as bad as all those Razzies, picked up by Mr Verhoeven himself, would suggest. The film IS entertaining, slick and stylish, and should by no means be taken as seriously as it was done by most critics at the time. Still, I give this film a 4 out of 10, because Verhoeven failed to deliver what he had promised a slick, expensive big-budget porn flick!

I hope there was a lesson learned here. Showgirls is a very feeble attempt. An attempt at trying to make an audience (who have mainly shown up on the promise of some female skin) care about a ragtag of characters trapped in a formula 'claw your way to the top' storyline seen many times before in many different ways. Predominately exotic dancers, aka strippers, these 'showgirls' as they are so called in more classier avenues.A lot of the problem with Showgirls arises in the fact that it doesn't know what it wants to be. That's my take. Is it supposed to be a story about a bunch of lost souls trapped in a sad, dirty industry or a pretty high budget, high profile excuse to see some girls wrap their physical assets around a metal pole? I think the answer is somewhat obvious by tone. Two different worlds. Two different ideas. Two different thought processes. The film is a mess. Not on the level some make it out to be, but still a mess. No one could convince me otherwise. Showgirls is an experience ... and not of the good kind.Even with the lowest common denominator - the T&A - does this movie fail. There's skin on display, but much of it isn't of the titillating sort. The story is a test pattern, there's only brief flashes of arousal, so what else is there to say? Paul Verhoeven can do so much better as a director. Actor Kyle MacLachlan and actress Gina Gershon both good at doing their respective things albeit fun to watch in Showgirls are still very much wasted. Meanwhile the virtual unknown, Elizabeth Berkley, actually fares pretty well, with clothes or not. In fact, Showgirls as a film fares a lot better today than it did in 1995. Go figure.

I see a refreshing view of sexuality in which breasts are so common that they become no more interesting than wallpaper, (which--for those who have never seen Follies Bergere--is exactly what this world is like.) I see incredible photography, brilliant blocking, unforgettable characters, insanely fun dialogue and a kind of psychotic-yet-critical view of American culture that you just can't find anywhere outside of a film by Paul Verhoeven. In my opinion it's a nearly perfect film (Nomi's sleazy past should have been more of an issue,) and that's not sarcasm, thank you very much. The much-maligned rape scene really says it all. If you watch the film more than once, you see something quite amazing in the cutaways during the rape. Every single nasty unpleasant couple you've seen during the film is dancing together in the background behind Nomi and Zach. Even Nikki and the Japanese businessman Mr. Okida can be spotted together. Accident? Hell no. Cynical? Extremely. But so is American Beauty which everyone seemed so excited over. (I hated it. So smarmy. The ending was obviously re-written from a more superior version.

Robocop was an extremely well executed jab at 80's corporate greed and fear of new technology.  Starship Troopers occaisionaly got its messages muddled.  Now we have Showgirls, a movie who's message (If there actually is one) is so unapparent as to render the film a failure if it was even originally conceived with a satirical slant.   Regrettably, movie making is a business, and we the audience are the consumers.  Would we call a car a success if it had a stunningly powerful engine, but wasn't marketed as having such and therefore nobody noticed?  No.  Bad analogy I know, but the point still survives.  It is no good making a 'satire' if the mass audience and/or critics fail to notice, and I'm sorry, but a few indignant reviews on this site don't qualify as a fresh appraisal, especially when the user rating doesn't correspond with the defenders.  The people have voted with their feet on this one it seems.  Fight Club is an example of a satire that found its audience, if not with the general public, then at least with many critics.   In any case, I'm not entirely sure if these 'advocates' are not having a little joke at our expense.  I hope to God they are.  Folks, one point, facetiousness does not translate well to print.  Bear that in mind, or people might think that you actually like the film!   The sex is more explicit in porn, and there are less examples of people straining for 'credible' acting.  They know they are making a film with a clearly defined aim, and they cut to the chase.  Not so with Showgirls unfortunately.  Yes, I was turned on by the naked women, but only because they were naked women, not because the director had tried to make it an 'experience' for me.  This is the least erotic film with lots of nudity in it that I've seen.  That's hardly a glowing recommendation...   (OFT-REPEATED SPOILER.)   ...and the pool sex scene?  Laughable and gross at the very same time; the film-makers should have taken that opportunity to have both characters drown... Now that would have been entertaining!

In fact, while watching this film at 2am, I had just listened to Penny's naive He's not SERIOUS babble and laughed so hard tears were streaming down my face and I woke up everyone in the house.It also took me until about the sixth viewing or so for me to determine what the plot was supposed to be.

She acts the way she does because... she was a hooker?  Huh?  Is any of it making sense now?Needless to say, the characters are more wooden than the children in Mrs. Doubtfire.  Does *anyone* have any motivation for what they are saying, or do people in Las Vegas actually spend all of their time sitting around trying to say cliche billboard/porno-esque lines all day long?  Is everyone truly one-dimensional?  Does nobody there have motivation or personality? Several times during this film I've sat staring and wondering, WHY on earth did he/she just DO that?  Why did Nomi up and start using coke?  Why did Cristal waver between bitch and friend at completely non-plot-forwarding moments?  WHY DID THE BLACK DANCER GUY EVEN COME INTO PLAY?

Showgirls is a big hot soap opera with cheesy dialogues, bad acting and tons of nudity. Verhoven wanted to do a movie about the difficulties of the lives of lap dancers focusing especially on Nomi a beautiful professional dancer who is forced to strip to become famous in Las Vegas. The movie is more about how these girls are treated than about stripteases (although there are lot of these sequences) and it shows a different look at Las Vegas (Mike Figgis and Martin Scorsesse made 2 different movies about Las Vegas this same year). Where Showgirls succeed is in Verhoven's direction full of hot and colorful images creating a warm and exiting atmosphere, accompanied with a crazy soundtrack, the viewer almost feel that he's in a strip club. Maybe for some people this is not a sufficient reason to watch this film but for me it is. Verhoven is the only director in Hollywood who dares to do what others will never do, maybe he was very occupied making his movie very provocative and shocking that he forgot the screenplay.

The plot meanders alarmingly, until we feel like we're listening to a disjointed anecdote that has so far covered gone into laborious detail about the speaker's encounter with a shop assistant, his drive to work, an argument he had with his wife, and something that happened to him last week, and is still no nearer to resolution.  To be honest I walked out.  Never have I come so close to the end before giving up.Cinematography was excellent - I mean, truly superb, gorgeous, a style I haven't quite seen elsewhere.  Had this style been applied to something truly erotic the result could have been a masterpiece, however bad the script.  Instead we got Las Vegas. Is there a less arousing place?

Fortunately, I only paid a dollar to see it (and, oddly, I was sitting in that theatre with an audience made up largely of senior citizens... they must have been Saved by the Bell fans).I'm a fan of good films (from Casablanca to the Truman Show), and this film failed worse than any I've ever seen on that level.I'm a fan of camp (from the original Star Trek to To Wong Foo), and this movie fared only slightly better on that level.I'm a fan of pornography (from pure sex to down on the farm 3), and this film didn't even cover that area particularly well, apart from one lap-dance scene, which was wonderful.If, as the Europeans aver, Showgirls was supposed to be funny and/or satirical, I can certainly admire that intent.  However, it really gave the viewer no clues whatsoever to suggest that.  I never once knowingly winked at the dead-on portrayal of Americana--I was too busy staring at the screen with my mouth hanging open, wondering what atrocity would be next to greet me (the on-the-rag scene and what-the-hell rape scene were the biggest train wrecks).I do agree, however, with one earlier reviewer everyone should see it, just to say they have.

She is the worst I have seen. She had one facial expression, sucked at trying to be serious, and couldn't dance her way out of hell(lots of huffing and puffing). I didn't even think she was that good looking, she has a horse- face. She had no grace at all and looked ridiculous in her role. The lead character, Nomi , said she wasn't a whore but oh she really played the whore/slut card pretty darn well throughout the whole movie.Every single character seemed to blend together and was lifeless. Really, there were no stand-out characters, they all were one-dimensional and had less expression than a plastic Barbie doll. There was nothing genuine about anyone, they were just trashy, self-centered, sex egotists, and didn't have the slightest emotional appeal. Throwing in that Andrew Carter guy was a very bad mistake as he served no purpose in the film and the background on him was non-existent. He was a big jerk to begin with and when he said I like your ass, he turned out to be just a dirty- minded scumbag who thinks of women as nothing more than something to grab onto and enjoy. At least he got his ass kicked by Nomi.Surprisingly, this movie proved to have some entertainment value, albeit in a different sort of way. Lots of sexy dancing and adult oriented behavior but other than that the movie seemed to drag on for more than its worth. The first time I saw the nudity and sexual scenes, I was like Yeah, this movie isn't so bad but then it started to be poured on and on, relentlessly, making it hard to watch. It's hard to appreciate the beauty of seeing some naked body parts on screen when you're almost seeing it the entire time. It should be treated as a reward for watching the film, that is built up to instead of making it look trashy and tasteless. Even for me it got to be kind of sickening to see all of those women walking around naked for a half hour. The plot was just plain stupid. Nomi, a drifter supposedly from New York, comes to Las Vegas wanting to become a dancer and has to climb the ladder and fight the odds to become a top Vegas showgirl. For what? Is she that trashy and desperate for a living that she has to resort to selling her body? And it was played out in even worse fashion. The jokes and humor in this film were crude and just plain unfunny. Who came up with she looks better than a ten inch dick and you know it? That ugly hoe popping her boobs out again and again was supposed to be funny? Terrible script and actors/actresses alike who were about as exciting and thoughtful as a glass of water.There were some highlights, if any, in this movie that seemed to hold up what was a essentially a piece of garbage film that I'll never see again. The dancing was sensational, and the Elvis-look- alike guy in the truck was cool...and...well...that's about it. The costume design was downright trashy and it seemed like every flashy dance scene had the women stripping off their clothes and being groped all over. Only a movie to see in your private time. This movie doesn't even deserve an NC-17 rating, if you even call this a movie. It wouldn't even qualify as a good porn film. It was like a bunch of D-list actors thrown together who don't know where they are going or what to do. They just partied, danced and what not until it was over. There was no chemistry between any of the characters and the progression of getting to know any of them was lackluster. There is so much more wrong with this film but that would probably take a while to write about so I'm just going to say this movie should not be on anyone's wish list. It is the movie that should be banned all across the world (and space if there are civilizations out there). Guard your sons, guard your daughters, this movie is the god of everything terrible and an example of bad-movie making to learn from. A trashy film that even landfills would be scared of.

The movie seems intended as a love letter to her, though I don't recall anyone in the 1990's saying, Remember Jessie from 'Saved by the Bell'? God, I wish they'd get her into a porno flick so we could see what she's got! What Berkley's got in Showgirls is a more explicit version of her petulance routine from that Saturday morning teen show. Berkley plays Nomi, a girl essentially from nowhere who wants to become a dancer. (And I do mean from nowhere. She has no family whatsoever, and later in the movie, another character has to explain to her what an M.B.A. is.) For no good reason, Nomi decides that becoming a dancer involves hitchhiking to Las Vegas. From that point, the script goes into two major loops. One is that, in one form or another, all the major characters have an obsession with either Nomi's dancing or her breasts. Either Nomi's being told how beautiful her chest is, or she's being told how much raw talent she has as a dancer. I don't know from Las Vegas, but having seen a few dancers and a few breasts in my day, my frank assessment is that Berkley is not outstanding in either department.The other loop is that Nomi is forever either showing off every inch of her lithe body or doing her best to simulate the sex act, only to go running off in anger every time somebody insinuates that she's a hooker. Now, where would anyone get that idea (other than her mentors requesting that she ice up her nipples before every show)? The movie's main, er, thrust is that Nomi works her way up to being a dancer in a show featuring what we're told is Vegas' star attraction, Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon). Eventually, we're told that Cristal has designs on Nomi, mainly so that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven (the same enlightened team behind Basic Instinct) can indulge their lip-smackin' woman-on-woman fantasies.From there, the movie goes into a hyper, NC-17 variation of All About Eve, or what it would be if Bette Davis and Ann Baxter decided to get it on before they went into career damage control.Despite this movie's seedy reputation, it's not fun enough to be a good bad movie. It does have some Ed Wood-like dialogue whoppers -- when Nomi's old boss sees her hit the big time, he blithely comments, It must be strange not to have someone c*** on you -- but not enough to sit through this slop. Mostly, the movie makes you wonder how it dragged in actors such as Kyle MacLachlan, L.A. Law's Alan Rachins, and most notoriously, Gina Gershon who, with her big breasts and monotone line readings, comes off like Adrienne Barbeau's big sister.

I liked it the first time I saw it but wondered why. So I went back to see it a second time. I liked it much better the second time. Why? Showgirls is about integrity and the things that must be done to stick to it. In the very beginning when Nomi pulls a weapon this is not the act of a nice passive girl. This is the act of someone alert to defending herself with offense.Every step along the way, Nomi wants to be in control. She has reason as her past hasn't treated her well. There are things she can't control if she is to pursue her ambition. She is disappointed but deals with it. She is wary and mistrustful of any signs of love and is slow to reciprocate kindness. When she finds someone she does love, she defends that person as she would herself.In the end she learns and we learn. If she can succeed on her own of beating the system we learn as well as she. This may be why many love this film. Those who don't care for it may be a part of the very system that oppresses. I wonder.Addendum What amazes me is the number of reviewers who disliked it. This review is directed at them. Aren't they confusing the film's content with its quality? The content is nasty. Ever had nasty done to you? The film is about dealing with nasty.

As I watched this film, I was surprised in the first 40 minutes or so with the level of nudity. But, as the film progressed, I became more comfortable with it. It is the world these women either want or need to be in. These places are there for male entertainment because this is what most men like. We may not admit it, but it is a fact. This film represents what someone would most likely see in one of the places represented in it. In modern times it has been scaled back in some places mind you.

Robocop was a vicious satire on violence, the police state, and action films in general (with a generous sideswipe of television news and sitcoms), but if you were unaware of Verhoeven's intent with the film, you will most likely only see a brutally violent action film supporting a fascistic police state. Much the same can be said for most of his films which tend to have a secret intent that is often directly opposed to what you are actually watching. Which brings us to Showgirls, which is a unrelentingly grim tale of a drifter (played with absurd intensity by Elizabeth I'M SO ANGRY AT THIS BOTTLE OF KETCHUP AND THESE FRENCH FRIES Berkeley, whose acting chops graced us prior on Saved by the Bell) who hitches into Las Vegas with the dream of becoming a dancer. That's it. If you think anything is going to happen or change, you are sadly mistaken. What follows are two hours of horrifying bleakness that gives Larry Clark's Kids a run for its money. Showgirls, of all of Verhoeven's films, is a tough one to sit through. I am loath to call it satire, because beyond the lead actress' laughable super-intensity, there is little to laugh about. This is a movie filled with awful, hideous, uncomfortable sex scenes and seedy, wholly unsympathetic characters who will, over the course of the film, achieve nothing except to send the viewer into a spiral of soul-crushing despair. I would like to think that there is something more to this. After making Basic Instinct and all the plaudits it received as an 'erotic thriller', I expect Verhoeven reacting with some distress. Sex does not equal erotica and the nihilistic Bret Easton Ellis-esquire series of wealthy people killing each other off (with no value judgment because they're all so evil and lacking in humanity or worth to begin with) was not intended to titillate. 'Sex?' he asked, 'They want sex? I'll give them so much sex they'll never want sex again!' and thus Showgirls was born. With every passing minute of film, a little piece of your humanity is chipped away. It is an epic in human degradation, showcasing all that is bad and wrong, with only the most rudimentary slapped on 'moral' of staying true to yourself and your friends. My theory is that this film was intended to be extremely unpleasant viewing, a horror flick where we the audience are both the monster and the victim. Its intent is to highlight how low life can sink and to show vehemently that bared breasts and a lot of sex does not make something sexy, and perhaps to make the audience re-examine their thoughts on the long line of so-called 'erotic thrillers' that were so popular in the late eighties and early nineties (most of them starring Michael Douglas, to everyone's misfortune). Maybe this is how Verhoeven has come to view America or Hollywood, an entire population of swindlers and whores. Yet as much as I believe there is more to Showgirls than what is seen at face value, its face value is so dreadful and off-putting that it's hard to stare into that abyss and search for meaning. It is one of the most grueling experiences in modern cinema and it may permanently ruin sex on film for those who view it. It is brilliant in its awfulness.

Paul Verhoeven's direction is never less than competent, and the widescreen photography is very good, taking advantage of the Vegas and desert locales--giving it almost a spaghetti-western look. Elizabeth Berkeley's Nomi is such a fierce little creature, who uses her looks, sexuality and dancing skills to get back at a world she has every reason to be angry at. Gina Gershon's Crystal is such an over the top bitch you end up liking her in spite of herself. Kyle MacLachlan is good as the hotel entertainment director, and Robert Davi gives a memorably sleazy performance as the strip club manager. There have been better films about Las Vegas--The Godfather Part 2, Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and Viva Las Vegas come to mind--but few that really capture the glittery, unapologetically vulgar mystique of the city that has built itself on appealing to everything vile and sordid in human nature.

From the folks who brought you Total Recall, Basic Instinct and (especially) Robocop comes this loathsome ordeal about a Las Vegas dancer who is an overnight success when a star quite literally 'breaks a leg' (after being pushed down some stairs by the main character). Elizabeth Berkley is a tall, gangling, somewhat uncoordinated actress who plays Nomi Malone, a tall, gangling, somewhat uncoordinated arrested adolescent who wants to be a Las Vegas dancer but refuses to be exploited, which is sort of like going for a swim but refusing to hold your breath. In 'Showgirls,' Berkley wears extremely high-gloss lipstick and pouts in a way that makes her look a lot like The Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is where this movie should be deep-sixed. She seems to think that a petulant flounce is great acting She uses that move over and over again in this turkey.'Showgirls' has in common with Verhoeven's other work a pervasive misanthropy Self-interest is all; people, or government, or corporations, are venal, corrupt, and self-seeking; trust no one; kill or be killed, either literally or figuratively. The difference is that the main character in Robocop was Murphy, a good man battling a corrupt establishment, ditto for Douglas Quaid in Total Recall; or Nick Curran in Basic Instinct, a deeply flawed but basically responsible guy battling a twisted woman and his own inner demons. In 'Showgirls,' we have Nomi, who has a major personality disorder and about whom we care not at all. There is one character in this travesty who is sympathetic Molly Abrams (Gina Ravera), and you have to conclude that she's nicer than she is smart for taking the drifter Nomi into her home and helping her find work after she blows into Vegas. Molly wins the No Good Deed Goes Unpunished Award by getting raped by a big movie star near the end of the film, in a totally contrived sequence that exists solely for the purpose of setting up a big revenge scene for the protagonist.So many naked breasts and butts are shown so early and so often that the impact of all that bare skin is completely lost at a fairly early stage. Nomi does a lap dance at one point that looks like it could give her two or three herniated discs. A lot of money and resources obviously went into several large, spectacularly vulgar production numbers that are supposed to be Las Vegas floor shows featuring Nomi's main antagonist, Cristal Connors, played by Gina Gershon in a role that has all the potential of keeping her out of the big time for years to come. At the same time as Cristal recognizes an adversary and rival in Nomi, she has a sort of twisted semierotic interest in her that defies all logic and reason. You watch Gershon dancing nearly nude on a Las Vegas 'stage' and wonder, 'How did a nice Jewish Beverly Hills High School graduate let herself get snookered into a career-killer like this dismal dog of a film?'My rating Bomb (lowest).

I think his mission is to take the formula of the Hollywood blockbuster, which he understands perfectly (Robocop) and push it (Total recall) and push it some more (Basic instinct) until it explodes (Showgirls). What makes Verhoeven truly admirable is that he keeps pushing (Star troopers) until the movie becomes a pastiche of itself and of the genre. Note I haven't seen Hollow Man and I am quite curious whether it still fits the equation.On this continuum, as I said, all movies fit the blockbuster formula very well very polished cinematography, great production values, ridiculous plot developments, sex&violence, vacuous acting, etc. Up to 'Showgirls' the formula has the expected effect on the movie-watching crowds; after it (i.e. 'Troopers') the very simple-minded movie-goer funnily enough still likes it on that wham-bang level, but most people perceive it as a satire of sorts.This leaves 'Showgirls' the odd movie out. The ingredients are the same as, but the dosage is different it's too much to take but not enough to be truly over the top. The movie hovers in a very precarious region around the top making the viewer very uncomfortable. As most of the reviews will testify, many feel guilty about watching it; many criticize it without giving motives (the worst movie **EVER**!!); many give motives that are absurd (plot holes? you need to take a movie quite seriously to dig for plot holes.) or incorrect (poor cinematography? quite the contrary.) or at best questionable (poor acting? not worse than anything with Tom Cruise in it and, besides, a certain mannerism of acting is part of what I call 'the Hollywood formula'.)The greatness of this movie, or rather of Verhoeven's work as a whole, lies in what it says about the person who watches the film. I wouldn't call Verhoeven an artistic genius, because he might simply work mechanically, increasing the dosage of the ingredients with scientifical precision. He might do it out of curiosity, or maybe he even foolishly thinks the more the better. Alghough I strongly doubt he is a fool. The fact that he accepted the Razzie award for 'Showgirls' in person tells me he's in on the joke.Anyway, kudos to him for keeping this grand experiment going all the way and not being phased by the critics, the public or the studios.

Actually, it functions quite well for what it was intended to be, i.e., a pretty good mainstream erotic film. Unfortunately, because of the bum wrap it (as well as its writer, director, and main actress Elizabeth Berkley) got, it turned out to be one of the last ones ever made. Because this film got such negative reviews, most mainstream film makers began to shy away from doing erotica. Thus, if we wish to view an erotic film that was made in the last five years, we're mostly stuck with porn or those cheesy, plotless, softcore films which play on late-night pay cable and pay-per-view.

Who cares, grow up, separate your moral opinions from your appraisal of art.The dialog is wonderful, ironical, satirical and very very cynical on a level where most Americans, most of whom are not used to this type of humor, can not understand exists. In fact, I can not think of any dialog that is snappier and multi-layered, except perhaps Starship Troopers. Berkeley is excellent, though her dancing could be sexier and more sensuous, but I suppose that's the way it is in Vegas. She delivers her lines like a soap actress, yes, and that is not so uncommon for very drama queens. Gina is divine, of course, some people have complained about her schizo personality (on one hand she loves Nomi, on the other she hates her) - well, welcome to drama queen world. This is real life, not some explanatory role-model movie.Take home message This movie was not made to be a heartfelt drama movie. And it is not so bad that it's good, like Plan 9, you know.

Only in The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies have I seen more unnecessary dance numbers.

The plot is not as stupid as porns, but not much brighter.The movie is so bad I actually recommend people to see it for that reason.

I saw the DVD around and ignored it. I happened to watch it on cable without knowing what I was watching. It ran several times, and several times I changed channels early on.Then one time I happened to stick with it, largely for the incredible quantity of babe bods. And then a funny thing happened - the movie became interesting. The people in the movie kept changing. The acting was fine, the characterizations were consistent. But as the movie unfolded, you saw different sides of the characters. It's all too rare these days to see character development and depth.What you were essentially seeing was what the lead, Nomi, was seeing. the question for a beautiful woman like that in Vegas was who can you trust? Repeatedly, she had to make a call, despite the best efforts to sweet talk her. Most of the time she got it right.She also had to make decisions about morality and personal values in a place largely devoid of them, or at least according to the movie's premise. That is what life is about for most of us, whether we are a showgirl or an accountant. In the end, her values were higher than the accountant's.Sure some of the characters in this movie are unattractive. But it can take real acting talent to portray a jerk, unless that's the real you. All the characters in the film are strongly and clearly drawn. And Elizabeth Berkley apparently did a pretty convincing job of not being herself, if you read her bio trivia item Once sat next to a man on an international flight who watched Showgirls (1995) on his in-seat video screen and never recognized her.That's something for an actress to be proud of! I don't know how realistic this movie is in its portrayal of Las Vegas. While I have been to Nevada, I have never had any desire to visit there. All the gambling towns I have seen have been remarkably joyless places.What struck me about the stage dance numbers is that they verged on live sex shows, under the guise of art. Indeed, all the dancing, public or private, had a layer of sex. I guess that's the point. If you are looking for dance as abstract art, this ain't it. (Although the main stage number has some of the earthiness of Stravinsky's La Sacre du Printemps, as sort of faux art.)Perhaps that's what Nomi aspired to, but Vegas wasn't the place to find it.There was plenty of nudity and sex in Showgirls. But, unlike some movies of this ilk, it rises above this through the interesting character development. It doesn't have the depth of a truly great film, but it has the depth of a very good film. And it is far more interesting than some big name movies I have seen that have turned out to be flat and too conventional. What's with all the Razzies? Showgirls certainly is nowhere near the league of Titanic, the gold standard for razzies.I think both Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon did fine jobs acting, and both were certainly easy on the eye.The closest movie I would compare it to is Nashville, which was also about clawing your way to fame. The first time I saw Nashville, I didn't get; I was bored. It didn't have the plot structure of a standard film. But once I understood the unique approach of Nashville, I realized how extraordinary it was. While not quite on the same level, I think people should look at Showgirls again with an open mind.

The fake nails, the 97 coats of mascara, the brassy hair and the excessive use of eye and lip liner make Berkley look ridiculous, even clownish, and seriously decrease any chance of her being perceived as attractive.The other actors seem to be trying to eek out some feeling, but the writing in this film is, simply put, dreadful. The dialogue is corny, trite and laden with clich√©s; I've seen better script writing on soap operas. In fact, that's pretty much what Showgirls is a soap opera with lots of nudity and sex.

And some of the flesh is male too, so nobody can accuse the production of being sexually exploitative. We've seen Kyle MacLachlan's buns before in Blue Velvet, in which he was my supporting player, so there's not much new there, but Elizabeth Berkeley was new to me and compared to MacLachan's, her buns just -- well, they shine. And while it's true she's not much of an actress, she can really DANCE. Her onstage performances are especially good when she's not hampered by too many cumbersome outer garments. The choreography is nothing to be ashamed of either, unless you happen to be the choreographer. Enough abdominal contractions and pelvic thrusts to give Martha Graham abdominal cramps in her grave, groaning at the excess. But at least we're spared another Bob Fosse imitation. (You can tell because nobody wears a derby.) The numbers are most ballet-derived mainstream modern dance, and by mainstream I mean nobody takes any chances. This is Las Vegas, folks, and Paul Taylor is safely locked away in some closet somewhere.Elizabeth Berkeley is beautiful too. But then ALL of the showgirls are beautiful. They're glossed up and painted like Playmates of the Hour, so much so that it's hard to tell one from the other at times. No matter. They're all pretty much flawless.The plot shouldn't be neglected either because it's sui generis. Who could have thought of the plot twist in which the lead showgirl's performance is sabotaged by a bitchy subordinate so that she is dropped and injures a knee and an unknown dancer has to go out there a nobody and come back a star? And all the while the poor girl -- her name is Nomi Malone or Anomi Baloney or something like that -- has to put up with hits from rough-talking and treacherous bad guys. And girls too. The director and writer have had the good taste to throw in a couple of lesbian scenes. And an interracial affair too. Not to mention the least convincing illustration of coupling in a pool that I've yet seen on screen. What I want to know is, why didn't they bring in the chauffeur?The flick has one good thing going for it, despite its preposterous qualities. There's a lot of nudity.

This genre should be celebrated, not vilified. And I, personally, would love to see a sequel, except that the reviews were so awful I don't know that anyone would do it---even WITH Jenny McCarthy! My main criticism of the movie is that it depicts strippers as unwilling participants who have nothing else they can do. Many strippers choose to do what they do because they love it, and not just for the money. Most are NOT drug addicts; many are students, single mothers, and regular women who just happen to take their clothes off for a living. I personally know of a couple who actually met their husbands at work. I wish this other, normal viewpoint was more explored in this film. I have seen Showgirls about six times, and allowing for some weak writing, it is still an entertaining and enjoyable film. We need more of those. Who out there has the courage to produce one now?

Of course the sex was ludicrous and tacky. I found this to be quite intentional! The writing is bad only in the sense that it seems to be a parody of shows like Baywatch. Joe Ezsterhaus is a bad writer, but only a director with the wit of Verhoeven seems to have been able to make a true success of his tacky, obvious words, by turning them on their collective ear with his over-the-top direction, just as he did in Basic Instinct. I believe the latter film was more successful in America because it was not about people you might meet on the street (or in a movie theatre). Rather, it concerned a privileged class which most Americans regard with suspicion anyway. It's true, films like this don't come along very often--And it's a shame.

You want to talk about over-the-top, intelligent, and beautiful parody, then let's just stick to the likes of Robocop, Total Recall, and even Starship Troopers. These were well-directed, well-written (this is an important difference) witty, and perfectly-acted films; they were exactly what they were supposed to be, and I consider Paul Verhoven a fine filmmaker.  But...to defend an atrocity like Showgirls, based souly on Verhoven's past success is ridiculous and compromising.  I mean, come on, I guess if you consider monotonous, blank delivery, painfully dull dialogue, and lots of glaring looks, and breathy lines, satire, then we have the finest satire ever made.  Elizabeth Berkeley wasn't bad, she was HORRIBLE!  And if that was Paul Verhoven's intention then he should go back to Holland (I have a problem with Europeans repeatedly satirizing American culture, any way)! Her entire performance was huffy looks, swatting hands, and turning her head fast to one side or the other.  Gina Gershon wasn't sexy, she was a joke.  She snarled through the whole movie!  Kyle MacLachlan...well he'll take any role, I forgive him. The only decent actor in the thing was the guy who picks Nomi up at the beginning of the film.  There was nothing good about this movie.  I didn't find it well-shot, the pace nearly put me to sleep, and the sex...what sex? It all looked phony and forced!  I wasn't offended by the content (although it was overtly gratuitous, even for Verhoven), I was offended by the context.  It was without rhythm, without chemistry, and, most importantly, without wit.  Joe Esterhaus can write a good script if it has Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in it, but otherwise....  Verhoven has succeeded in the past with strong, biting humor, and actors who understood the material.  If there was anything salvageable at all in this, then he should have cast Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep to try to dig it out. I was finally seventeen when this film came out, and I couldn't wait to go to the theatre and see an NC-17 movie.  The only reason I didn't walk out was to see if anything bad would happen to the lead role.  And nothing did!  And, finally, who goes to see showgirls in real life, any way?  Is there such a big deal made by the press about the topless-dancing industry?  This film would have you think that these people were the biggest stars in America. Do me a favor, Paul next time you want to satire American culture, do it about something satireable; do it about something people give a squat about. Nonetheless, everyone should see this film, just to say they did.  Movies this bad come along only once in a lifetime.

For what it's worth, this film DOES actually portray a certain kind of people in a realistic light, it's just not behavior that your average person understands. Intent seems to be a very important topic to people when discussing SHOWGIRLS, but then again, there are still idiots who think that STARSHIP TROOPERS was an intentionally fascist film. SHOWGIRLS *does* show America in its worst light, and if you think that wasn't a sincere intention of the filmmakers, you're wrong. Read any interview with Verhoeven on the subject for proof. Or just watch the film without referring to all the reviews you read. More proof John Waters and Quentin Tarantino both called it the best film of 1995. The film was successful in every country in the world except for America. It did not lose any money. They still show it in France. Foreigners love the film for the same reason they love our presidential scandal. The way Americans react to sexual material makes them laugh. Verhoeven, with his sincere outsider's view shows America a part of itself that it doesn't want to admit to. It made $20 million on its first domestic (American) run, making it only half as financially successful as a piece of garbage like TITANIC, percentage-wise.

While some moralists will never be able to come to terms with it, I think the film will be vindicated eventually. Not even Elizabeth Berkley's performance is as bad as everyone claims. While she may sometimes rely too much on sitcom techinques and shortcuts in her method, she has still clearly given exactly the performance that Verhoeven wanted. Those who have trouble swallowing this analysis of the film would do well to check out Verhoeven's early Dutch effort SPETTERS, or even last year's hit STARSHIP TROOPERS.

As it is, the film is an eerie cocksure mess of a picture; a film embracing the idea of women selling one's body as an appropriate career and a film on the side of women treading the grounds of a Las Vegas stage in order to demean their gender. This is, of course, after providing us with a heartless tract on pro-plastic surgery wherein falsity and such are the answers to life and that you're yet to make it in life should you not be donning the bright, sexy, exotic turf of a Nevada stage. This is one of those awkward projects wherein which the film is rubbish, and we know it's rubbish, but the film in question DOESN'T.The film is about the entry to; the living in, as well as the consequent dominating of, a very specific realm within the American city of Las Vegas perpetrated by a woman named Nomi (Berkley) who's in her twenties. Looking to hitch a ride with just about anyone at the film's outset, the film makes a point to capture just how na√Øve she is at when the guy with whom she journeys swipes her belongings and drives off again. You have to wonder what he thought was in there for him - maybe he thought the case was worth something. Prior to all this, they cruise into town and lay eyes on Vegas for the first time There she is (!) utters the driver, insinuating a general feeling of awe at the lights and at what Vegas conveys. The city is practically glowing, radiating there in the night as this green-horn rumbles on in for the first time looking to make it in the world of dancing and entertainment. The fact Nomi is too trusting of the gentleman, and that she loses at a game of slots in a casino at this very early time in her tenure here, cements her status as being completely out of her depth.Cut to six weeks later, and Nomi is staying with a friend whom she has met in Molly (Ravera). Backstage at a Vegas show, Nomi falls in love with her surroundings; surroundings of which have already fallen in love with that of Cristal Connors (Gershon), the establishment's star showgirl whose changing room is set away from the general chaos of other's and can muster up very little emotion when offered a bouquet of flowers for a latest performance. Such is, one feels, the quantity of past offerings of this ilk born out of this on-going adulation that this reaction is induced. It is here Nomi truly desires to be, it is here Cristal truly desires to stay there can only be one true showgirl and when they get off on a somewhat negative first foot, battle commences.The film is essentially a string of second unit dance routines wherein very little is on but an awful lot is on show. Ultimately, this does little to raise the film above the level of usual American blockbuster fare - tits and arse are merely standing in for explosions and stunts. There are a number of scenes set at a pole dancing club owned by Al Torres, a slimy character played by Robert Davi &#x96; the very place at which Nomi must work if she is to hone her trade and get anywhere near places such as where Connors resides as queen of the stage. It's no secret the film enjoys these scenes, so much so that instead of actually probing as to why it is women might do this sort of work, or desire to be a superstar within these fields in the first place, we are instead invited to watch on; to join the punters and leer. A measure of how all over the place the film truly is lies in one specific sequence, wherein Davi's character briefly re-enters the heroine's life to stop and say hello for a minute. The guy was always a creep, and she was happy to be rid of him; but the romanticised tone as he once again re-enters the frame would suggest he's not all that bad, and that we should ourselves have missed him. I don't think so. Another odd moment arrives during a selection process sequence, when a male individual has for him a row of potential female dancers lined up for them so that he may cast his eye across and deduce whether they're fit for what the job demands &#x96; a sort of eerie syncing up with, one assumes, how the likes of Berkley and Gershon landed the roles of Nomi and Connors in the first place.The difference is that within the diegetic world of the film, a creep is at the helm of the project. Whereas one can lay little blame at the door of Paul Verhoven - someone whose female characters in Total Recall and Basic Instinct have been fun; feisty and often sexually charged without requiring the presence of rotten exploitation. The fallacy seems to fall with the fact those films depicted men first and foremost, with the dangerous women in their lives causing a chaos and such at the worst of times. Showgirls is, in a sense, constructed as if a 'men's picture'; a tale of two people vying for supremacy within a domain that pours lavish upon the dominant force and shoves the others to the back. Where Aronofsky's 2011 piece Black Swan nailed the case study, Showgirls just ends up being what it is an overly long chore stuck between being a contemplative mediation and a skin flick, a film which depicts women whilst systematically striking us as not knowing the first thing about them.

Kyle Maclachlan is pretty hilarious as a total sleaze/sex interest, and Gina Gershon is outstanding as the bitchy rival. It's always great to see Robert Davi in a film too.Yes, the so-called sex routines are cheesy beyond the belief and never alluring. Yes, the dialogue is often laughable but I think Verhoeven's having the last laugh &#x96; he intended his film to turn out this way. Whatever problems it has, SHOWGIRLS is an entertaining film &#x96; just like the rest of Verhoeven's canon.

I'd say so, but then that'd be denying it to any women who like to see powerful female characters who put every sleazy, heartless male character in the film in their place. If I could sum up Showgirls in one sentence it would be Not what you expect it to be. From the word go, Showgirls surprises you and refuses to play to any of the clich√©s. There are a number of scenes which will have you beginning to predict an ending which any other movie would have gone for, but this flick rejects the Hollywood templates and tells it's own, surprisingly compelling, story. That's not to say that there aren't some hard to believe moments, most characters in the movie seem to have the mood swings of a person with bipolar disorder - the smallest unfortunate event sends the characters to tears while a little good news sends them into jumping, giggling madness. It's not necessarily a bad thing in the unusual, illogical world the film creates, but a lot of the time you're watching one-liner spouting cartoons rather than people you can believe and relate to. Like many cult classics, though, RoadHouse comes to mind for example, within a few scenes you'll be immersed in the world of offbeat, sassily- scripted wise crackers. Of course, this paragraph is inevitable in this kind of movie, and my apologies to any females reading this who may find it sexist, but the real star of this movie is the large amount of female skin on show, and it most certainly delivers. While I don't believe any actor or actress should be cast for their body, Showgirls never fails to deliver some really stunning female figures. Usually, this isn't of importance to me but Showgirls makes a thing out of it's nudity in powerful and impressive dance routines which will fascinate and excite more than they will titillate; the bodies on show here are treated with an almost feminist level of respect, where the heroine's sexuality is shown as something awesome and powerful, to amaze, not to be whistled at by builders. Indeed, contrary to what may be implied by the film's poster (or even the name), Showgirls portrays some strong, powerful and unpredictable women with deep and interesting histories, particularly the protagonist, whose character development outcome and ending you will not even begin to predict. Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley) takes no prisoners and for once a movie doesn't end in apologies and reunions. Showgirls is incredibly daring. Much like the film's recurring theme, it gambles. Unfortunately not all gambles pay off and I believe this was completely slated by the mainstream critics, but if you're anything like me, this cult classic hits the jackpot.

Of course, Berkley isn't alone in getting her kit off she is joined by a whole dance troupe of topless beauties, led by the wonderful Gina Gershon as bisexual (surprise, surprise) primadonna Cristal Connors.Not only that, but we get tons of quotable dialogue, a changing room invasion by chimpanzees, a fat, foul-mouthed comedienne whose dress is cleverly rigged to expose her breasts when she flaps her arms, Robert Davi as a strip-club owner, a brutal rape which results in (as we are informed by the victim's doctor) a broken nose and vaginal tears (ouch!), and Nomi kicking said rapist into the middle of next week.Now try telling me that's not worth a 9/10!

It's quite ludicrous to believe that a man as talented ans smart as the creator of Robocop and Starship trooper, actually made the movie so vulgar and excessive by mere chance. Verhoeven knows exactly what he's doing, the movie is not vulgar, it's extremely sincere and strait forward about the absolute vulgarity of wanting to sell yourself at any cost, specially for a dream as tasteless and shortsighted as becoming a showgirl. The guy who says that this movie is involuntarily funny, obviously doesn't understand anything about cinema, and even less about the thought provoking and viscerally enjoyable work of Verhoeven.

Yet, probably that repetition can make you look for something behind the nakedness and find that THIS is exactly what showbiz has always been. Replace the story with any film industry in the world, or any field for that matter and you know what exploitation one faces, especially a young lass.The dances were OK, nothing great to write home about. Berkeley's acting was OK but she overdid it in the naked dance scenes.Although a few countries (where porn is easily available) have banned this movie and a few others have allowed 15-year-olds to watch it (12 in France), I think this is not going to be appreciated as a movie by such a young lot. They might still watch it for the sleaze effect.There are a few scenes that give us a hint about the emotions of the leaders in the industry, especially LOVE.

While this film may not have manifested the highest artistic ambitions ever fixed on the proverbial celluloid and certainly did not glitter with the most profound dialogs, the almost hysterical trashing by the reviewers raises some curiosity as to their subconscious - or possibly very conscious - mental processes. As to the former, perhaps it's just the old hang-up about sex that has grown strong again with the aging baby boomers getting religion, after they sowed their wild oats in the 70s. When the NC-17 rating was created for movies with sexual themes this side of porn, what Hollywood may have had in mind was artsy sex, or health-care sex, but not frolicky sex where people actually have fun. In the view of those critics, the latter might still belong into the X-category - at least as far as their public pronouncements go. But there could also be another, more sinister explanation. The film is not good for the image of Las Vegas. Presumably, Las Vegas likes to appear as just one step beyond clean family fun in the direction of risqu√©. This film places it quite a few steps towards the gutter; and this placement neither looks completely unrealistic nor without a certain allure. The powers that be in Las Vegas probably hated it; and one cannot help wonder how long an arm they have. Does the Las Vegas Visitors' Bureau direct millions of advertising money? No strong-arm tactics required - everyone writing for a publication knew precisely what was called for.However, it must be said that while the sexy ramblings in the first part of the movie were a pleasure to watch, the violence towards the end went a little too far beyond good fun; and one must hope that it was added as a dramatic effect and is not really the custom of Las Vegas.Yet overall, if Showgirls was such a bad movie, how come people still talk about it twelve years later?

Joe Eszterhas had earlier written the script for a film on the same theme, Flashdance. The two films, however, are very different. Alex, the lead character in Flashdance is a sweet, lovable, deeply religious girl whose dream is to become a ballet dancer. (Jennifer Beals's soft, gentle beauty made her well suited to the role). Nomi Malone in Showgirls, by contrast is a prize bitch, a girl whose motto seems to be (in the words of that eighties pop song) You've got to be a hustler if you want to get on. After hitch-hiking to Las Vegas, she finds work as a pole dancer, but has her eyes on a part in a lavish stage review named Goddess. Of course, she succeeds, and then works her way up to be understudy to the show's star, Crystal Connors. Nomi's main tactic in her rise to fame is to sleep with anyone she thinks can help her, even flirting with the openly bisexual Crystal. That flirtation, however, doesn't prevent her from pushing Crystal down a flight of stairs when she thinks the time is ripe for her to take over the leading role herself.The received opinion is that this is the film which blighted Elizabeth Berkley's career, but I cannot say whether that is a fair assessment, as I have not seen a single one of the thirty-odd films, TV movies and TV series she has made since 1995. However, contrary to received opinion I thought that she did a good job here, putting across Nomi's fierce, aggressive sexuality and her desperate desire for success, however transient and however worthless.One reviewer complains that the show Goddess is so obviously tawdry that he could not imagine why anyone would want to star in it. That is precisely the point. The openly erotic show is, as one character points out, little more than a more expensive, more pretentious version of the sleazy pole dancing which Nomi went in for in the earlier part of her career. There is an exchange in Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons when Thomas More asks the treacherous Richard Rich, who has been rewarded for his treachery with a government position in Wales, What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul? But for Wales? To paraphrase More's words, what shall it profit a woman if she lose her soul for a part in Goddess? It is a measure of Nomi's desperation for fame at any price that she is willing to do anything to star in such a tacky show; one of the targets of the film's satire is the way in which the entertainment industry exploits some people's insatiable desire for their fifteen minutes of fame. (If anything, that exploitation has become even greater since 1995 with the irresistible rise of reality TV shows). Of course, when one's fifteen minutes are up, disillusionment sets in. There is another nice performance from Gina Gershon as Crystal, a still-beautiful but jaded and cynical thirty-something, who finds it easy to forgive Nomi for pushing her down the stairs; she needs a rest, and the insurance money will come in handy.There is an obvious trap for those making films satirising the bottom end of the entertainment market, namely that of becoming what one is satirising. The Running Man was a film which fell into this trap, and Showgirls does not entirely avoid it. Those critics who took exception to the scenes of nudity probably had a point; Goddess may be tacky, and the pole-dancing even more so, but did Paul Verhoeven really need to show us so much of them in order to make his point? He might want to show us that Nomi has the morals of an alley-cat, but in doing so he also manages to show us that Elizabeth Berkley looks pretty good with her clothes off.The official verdict on this film seems to be that it is trash. That, at least, seems to be the verdict of the critics, of the public who stayed away in droves (it was not a box-office success), of the IMDb members who have given it an average mark of only 3.8, most of the reviewers on this board and of the organisers of the Razzie Awards who voted it not only the worst film of 1995 but also the worst film of the entire decade. (Did they miss The Blair Witch Project?) Liberal critics who would not normally turn a hair at the most extreme sexual perversions seemed to turn into fully paid-up members of the Moral Majority when confronted with the film's nude scenes; Roger Ebert called it a sleazefest and masturbatory fantasy. That's the same Roger Ebert who in an earlier incarnation was responsible for Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.When confronted with such a chorus of disapproval, my normal contrarian's instinct is to try and find something positive about the film. In the case of Showgirls I felt that many critics treated it as a serious drama and missed the vein of satire that runs through it. If one can avoid taking it too seriously, it can be enjoyed as a sardonic expose of showbiz life. It is in many ways a cynical film, but its saving grace is that it is cynical even about its own cynicism. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Guilty Pleasure","Date":"16 October 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Face it, we have all seen this movie and have liked something out of it.

In a manner of speaking it's a well-intentioned modernization of some tangled blending of All About Eve and A Star is Born.

Paul Verhoeven's directing is completely uncontrolled, naive, and painful to endure. Joe Eszterhas is at fault as well. Though he has been in the business for many years his screenplay feels two or three good lines of dialogue from amateur. Most of the characters are completely two-dimensional and the least original this side of a Lifetime movie.If that regurgitation of dialogue can be referred to as acting, it was some of the most over the top that has been contained in one film not originally intended as a comedy. Elizabeth Berkley, who got all sorts of press for going from TV's Saved by the Bell to showing her entire naked body and spouting foul language left and right, gave the worst performance of everyone involved. The only consistency with her portrayal was ending up completely naked by the conclusion of most scenes.Surprisingly in a work so weak a couple things stood out. Gina Gershon as the aging dancer with a nasty attitude had some bite, and Robert Davi delivered a comparatively stellar performance as a smarmy but likable strip club owner. Even though they were larger than life, excessively gaudy, and not really worth the price of a rental, a couple of the dance sequences are reasonably engaging and borderline genuinely erotic.

The way she throws herself around during the beginning when she first meets Molly is far from believable. What normal person treats a stranger (especially one who helped them) that way? Throughout the movie, she overacts- slamming doors, slamming her heels into the ground while walking, throwing temper tantrums, and getting way too excited over things. Even her dancing and sex scenes are over the top. Her sex scene in the pool with Kyle MacLachlan seems perfectly normal at first, until she starts convulsing like an epileptic fish out of water. It is very awkward to watch. Her dancing skills, however, are pretty impressive (save for the scene at the Crave Club where she looks like a complete idiot flailing her arms around and jerking her body like a lunatic). Whe knew that Jessie from Saved by the Bell could dance like that? I don't necessarily mean the stripping, either, but the mere fact that she is in sync with the choreography and some of the steps in her Stardust performances are pretty complicated. Gina Gershon as Cristal is a stone-faced bitch who takes a liking to Berkeley's character, Nomi Malone. She purposely buys her boyfriend a lap dance from Nomi at the Cheetah Club to humiliate her and show that she can buy and control her, like a slave. Later on in the movie, during a performance at the Stardust, she leads Nomi off of the stage and says, come on, slave girl. Her character is somewhat likable, though. Her southern drawl and constant use of darlin' make her charming, and although her intent is to make a fool out of Nomi, she is very cunning and seems genuinely interested in helping Nomi out. Cristal and Nomi bond at lunch in the Forum over champagne. The movie is obviously gratuitous with it's use of nudity, to the point where it is no longer shocking, and trying to remember what Elizabeth Berkeley looks like with clothes ON is a challenge. It's portrayal of Vegas showgirls, in my opinion, is slightly fictional, but not to say that it isn't entertaining.

There's been lots of movies with the be rich in Vegas shindig and this one isn't too different. you've got your stereotypical Big Shot money guys here and all kinds of sleezebags, but there's also a few warm-hearted people in Vegas who will take you in and help you get on your feet. Shes tossed around from a strip club to the Stardust theater by the lead star who has an almost obsessive attraction to her, regardless that Nomi hates her.Acting 5- James, Nomi's victim of chance bad luck throughout the movie was really fake and unrealistic. Almost everything that came out of his mouth seemed like he was reading a script. Crystal also had a way with words and seemed like she had nothing better to do in the movie but to be evil. Nomi was well.... exactly like her character in SavedByTheBell! Very very stubborn and always got her way. She and the rest of the girls all had amazing dance skills but acted like everything that happened to them threw them into an anger fit.Music 6- Maybe this movie should have been a musical, or at least had some musical numbers in it. There were quite a few showgirl performances but they only show about 2 mins of it at most. Still the Vegas shows in the movie were very powerful and cool.Costumes 8- Nomi goes through over 20 different wardrobe changes in this movie. Gstrings, Leather, glittering bikini, and plenty of other stripper outfits. They're all really nice looking and even when she bares all, her look is very beautiful. Cristal, being the lead star of the performance also has some great outfits, most of which heighten her character's evilness.Camera-work / Lighting 8- Vegas has always been a great place for amazing lighting and camera effects and this movie was no stranger. The sets were nicely lit and the scenes showing the landscaping of Vegas were very nice. There's a shot of her by her car staring at the Flamingo's swirling pink flashing lights and another in front of the Pyramid & Sphinx of the Luxor. Even James' shack of a house had nice camera work for the dances.Editing 7- Kind of a jumble at times but its a pretty straightforward storyline. Some characters don't go into detail as much with who they are and why they're trying to get back at Nomi but the majority of back story is explained. It could have used more side stories of other characters in the movie other than Nomi to explain how they got where they are.Uniqueness 4- Its a Vegas movie, but hell... its also a story of a tough girl working her way to the top. Its been done before yeah, but this movie has made a reputation of itself. While its not anything new to Vegas movies, it has its hokeyness that will bring audiences to see how things end up.Worth 6- a big BIG reason most people watched this (myself included) would to see our favorite bookworm Saved By The Bell girl get down and nasty and yes, you get to see her in full nude. The rape scene in the NC-17 version isn't anything too racy and the sex scene with Zack was all underwater so there wasn't anything to see there anyway. Aside from that its got plenty of T & A for people who just want some stripper action.Overall Score (Not an average) 7- People aren't going to watch this to see a deep involving story of a girl who grows to be a sweetheart after making it to the top. They want to see Jessie Spano, thats what they'll get. Her character is definitely way beyond overacting and everyone around her is scheming and evil but hey, thats what Vegas is like right? Its still worth a watch with friends to laugh at some of the corny lines but its not a BAD movie, it just falls in some obscure adult audience category that few people care to see.Reviewer's Insight (Including bias) So Okay, I got the movie for Elizabeth Berkley, knowing full well that there would be some really dumb plot and characters but what else do people see when they hear about Showgirls? Jessie Spano nude, thats right! I had seen clips of the censored VH-1 version and oh man, it must have taken some major time to not only cut out a LOT of scenes but to censor cussing and, get this, Literally PAINT black bikinis on all of the nudity. Its a lot of work that was regarded as one of the worst films of all time. I can assure you its really not that bad of a film. I, myself even had a chuckle or two at some of the lines, but that doesn't make it a bad film. The women are all pretty hot, and while every character overacts their part, it still keeps a decent story through it. Some amazing shots of Vegas are also in this film , and being to Vegas myself its fun to be able to point out and recognize some of the great places there. The movie is worth a watch, if anything to see plenty of topless dancing and Elizabeth Berkley bare all.

Verhoeven and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas are responsible for this pretty mess. It is so incredibly bad that you can't help but laugh. You ask yourself Were they serious when they made this film? You know they are, which makes you laugh even more.Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of being a dancer. She hooks up with Molly (Gina Ravera), who is a designer and works behind the scenes at The Stardust Hotel and Casino. It is during a visit that Nomi meets Cristal Connor (Gina Gershon), and things between the two get mean. Nomi at this point works at the Cheetah, run by the incredibly slimy Al (Robert Davi), and is offered a part in the Goddess show at the Stardust. Nomi and Cristal constantly go for each others throats, and Nomi wants Cristal's spot, her man Zach(Kyle MacLachlan), and fame.To be honest, this is pretty much a pornographic version of All About Eve. Don't believe me? Check out the scene when Zach confronts Nomi about who she is (Just like Addison with Eve!). The dialog is incredibly laughable (I bought it at Ver Sayce!), and there is a lot of contradictions Nomi constantly says she is not a whore, yet every single thing she does to get ahead suggests that she is! Plus, James (Glenn Plummer), lectures Nomi about AIDS and doing questionable sexual stuff, yet he gets caught with a fellow stripper AND gets her pregnant! (And that part about Nomi's time of the month? One word GROSS!). Finally, I must gripe about the rape scene. The film's only moral character ends up getting raped by a singer (More like a poor man's Michael Bolton) and his 2 bodyguards. This was just incredibly horrible and pointless. Again, this is a laughably bad film that was supposed to have been taken seriously, and failed miserably. If you enjoy watching cinema train wrecks, then this is the must-have in your collection. The V.I.P. Box Set is a must have not just for the little goodies (shot glass, cards, drinking games), but for the commentary by David Schmader, which makes the film even more fun!

Now I can confirm that it truly is a horrendous movie.The worst part is the script. Wretched dialog, extremely limited character development, absurd interactions between the characters. Nothing made SENSE. Nomi's countless hissy-fits were horribly ill-conceived- even pre-schoolers don't act like that.Speaking of acting- truly bad. And the worst acting was by the leading lady. The story of Nomi is intended to be the story of a girl who is destined to be a star. This, unfortunately, is NOT Elizabeth Berkley. Poor thing, I almost feel bad for her. She was obviously trying so hard. But she pranced around the screen like a newborn colt, all legs and elbows and ready to fall over. Her moves on stage and at the dance club were not at all attractive- waving her arms around as if to say Look at me! I'm dancing! I'm dancing! And her acting- just ridiculous. There is no better word for it.Now for the direction- I realize that every second of a movie is staged and scripted, but it's not supposed to FEEL like that. Most of the movie felt creepy and awkward. I'm willing to admit that this may be mostly from the TRULY BAD script and the equally bad acting, but I'm not willing to let Verhoeven off that easily.

This, of course, is my memory from the age of fourteen, so when the movie came up in conversation a few days ago, I thought I'd re-watch it and see how I viewed it now. Turns out that it's basically a film about Saved by the Bell's Jessie Spano getting naked.Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas presents Elizabeth Berkley's nudity through the guise of a tell-all look into strip clubs, Las Vegas, hooking, and greed. It ends up being simply the shallow masturbatory fantasies from a mind that has no knowledge of any of those things. I found the film at the video store under the Erotica section. Eroticism said Roger Ebert in his review of the film, requires a mental connection between two people, while masturbation requires only the other person's image. Too true. Every scene that involved sex of some sort was as emotionless as a bad porno flick, and contained at least three times as much gyration and body-thrashing as a good porno flick.Showgirls begins with a hopeful Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley), hitchhiking out to Las Vegas to make it big. After easily getting a lift with a stranger, she meets and befriends a woman named Molly who gives her a place to stay. Her generosity is strange to me, because within the first five minutes of the film, Nomi proves to be an emotional, violent wreck. So far she's pulled a switchblade, gotten into a fight, thrown french fries all over the place, and generally behaved like a spoiled child with Torret's syndrome.Nomi works as a stripper, and after meeting Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon), the star of a topless expensively-produced dance show at a real Vegas hotel, she reveals to Connors her profession.I'm a dancer, she says.Oh? Where? At the Cheetah. I don't know what it is you do over there, but if it's at the Cheetah, it ain't dancing. Nomi, of course, flies out of control, but piques the interest of the seemingly bisexual Connors, who soon comes to visit her with her boyfriend Zack (Kyle MacLachlan) at the Cheetah. Nomi seems insulted that Connors would objectify her the way she does, but performs an alarmingly violent lap-dance, which she's paid handsomely for. Through her performance at the club, she's invited to the hotel where Connors stars for an audition. She does well, but again feels objectified, so she runs off the stage in frustration. (This running off the scene in frustration comes to become a recognizable trait in Nomi.) To calm herself, she and Molly go dancing where she meets James, a horny but seemingly well-meaning dancer/choreographer who wants her to take dancing seriously.It turns out that she's gotten the job in the chorus, which of course fills her with delight--she's beginning to see her dreams take place. The plot now develops into a glimpse inside the world of showgirls--we see monkeys run around backstage, vindictive and spiteful dancers willing to disable each other to get ahead, and an underworld of greed and malice that is encouraged by managers and producers.The film is exceedingly terrible. I mentioned in my review for Top Gun that the Tom Cruise movie wasn't one of those so bad it's good types that people make it out to be--it was just bad. As a whole, Showgirls is a film that is so awful it's enjoyable to watch. Nomi's overly-aggressive behavior is hilarious and entertaining in itself, but the plot and the rest of the film is the icing on the cake. Here's a couple of examples 1. Cristal (who reveals in this conversation that she's named herself after the champagne) asks Nomi if she likes brown rice and vegetables (the preferred diet for girls in their show). Nomi says that she does. Really? Connors asks. After some persuasion, Nomi admits It's worse than dog food. I've had dog food, Cristal replies. Nomi's face lights up, as if they've got something in common, but Cristal puts on a far-away look A long time ago. Nomi admits to eating the same dog food, and they grow closer. My reaction What? Eating dog food? Who talks about that when they're eating lunch at the Bellagio? 2. The lap-dance scene and the sex scene between Nomi and Zack. There are two parts of your nervous system that control orgasms and arousal in humans, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. The parasympathetic controls arousal--if there is too much going on in the body, the system will receive the message that it's not worth the energy to be aroused right now, and in the male case, he will lose his erection. This is why, for example, you won't ever find yourself getting a hard-on while going for a jog. My question is how the hell could Zack maintain an erection with Nomi's violent thrashing? She does things with her back that I've only seen performed with a safety net. I would have been scared for my life if I were in his place, forget the orgasm. After doing a bit of research, I found that Elizabeth Berkley was only paid $100,000 for her role in this movie. What did they have to pay the chiropractors that they must have had on call throughout the filming?At 133 minutes, you might expect that the film would get boring after awhile. It never does. It only grows worse as time goes on, but no matter what's happening it's always entertainment.2.40/10.00 for Showgirls, but I recommend that everyone watch this movie at least once.

There might not have been premises for a classic here, but at least they should have been able to make it a tolerable movie.This is the touching story of stripper slash prostitute Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) who comes to Las Vegas seeking fame and fortune. She starts out dancing at a seedy joint, but through luck and some dirty moves she gets the opportunity to become a real showgirl! Soon though it becomes apparent that life as a showgirl is not as glamorous as Nomi had hoped...This movie sets the tone right from the beginning. From the inbred retard that Nomi hitches a ride with to Vegas, to her completely unwarranted emotional outbreaks this is a ride into the mouth of madness. I can only guess what script-writer Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven were thinking, but i'm not sure i WANT to guess. Because like someone pointed out, this is most likely a movie based on Joe Eszterhas highly secret list that he keeps under his pillow 100 things i would do if i was a woman for a day. And most of those things involve touching, displaying, fondling, talking about and otherwise handling breasts.Acting here is non-existent. Elizabeth Berkley makes a career-crashing performance in the lead, making her character into an emotional train-wreck lashing out at the most unexpected times. Gina Gershon is suitably sleazy as Cristal Connors, the queen of showgirls. Kyle MacLachlan should receive an award for strangest hairdo, but also deserves notice for his complete inability to act casual. It feels to me that even though director Verhoeven seemed to be completely oblivious as to how deep this movie was plunging, maybe the actors had some idea. Most of them are just plain awful, even actors that are usually at least acceptable. And why should they try? Lifting the paycheck, going home and hope nobody watches the movie was probably all they could do. The truth is that it would be easy to go on for literally days listing all the flaws in this movie. But there is no real point. This is a movie that has to be experienced. One of those marathons of crap that are so bad they turn into instant classics. So while the quality is on zero kelvin levels, the entertainment value is rather high. I would however recommend high levels of alcohol for this to be truly enjoyable. I rate this 1/10 for quality, 8/10 for entertainment and 10/10 for electroshock-inspired sex scenes.

With the minimally talented Elizabeth Berkley playing the skanky Nomi Malone (she might be alternately known as Gnome-y Malone, or Know Me Malone), a former juvenile delinquent who has just graduated from jail-bait status and hitchhikes to Las Vegas to be a lapdancer. I mean, showgirl. Things start off badly for her, and it becomes evident immediately that she would benefit from anger-management classes. After losing her luggage and money, she is mysteriously befriended by a young woman &#150; mysterious, because it is unimaginable that a stranger would offer assistance to someone so unstable, unpleasant and so trashy-looking. But we *are * talking about Las Vegas here. Gnomey's new friend is a wardrobe mistress at the casino for the show *Goddess* is playing, and sneaks Gnomey in to watch behind the scenes. It is here that Gnomey meets Cristal Connors (Gershon), a senior showgirl who calls everyone Darlin', and does a lot of cocaine. Originally envisioning Madonna as Cristal and Drew Barrymore as Gnomey, the scriptwriting is cruder than it needs to be, but that is part of its charm. Supporting characters further underscore the bottom-of-the-barrel approach to storytelling &#150; from the owner of the strip club where Gnomey works, to the sleazy choreographer who pursues her, to her fellow dancers, we are treated to a cattle call of unpleasant stereotypes. The scenes are awash in tawdriness that is supposed to represent the underbelly of American life, where everyone's a whore. A dire pronouncement, to be sure, but far more indicative of Verhoeven's state, than America's. As far as being the brilliant satire it was purported to be, that sounds like someone trying to put a good spin on an awful movie. Truly awful. Like a car wreck you can't take your eyes off of.

Seriously, she gets better with the movie.I think this movie got a bad rap from the sexually repressed, rather than from an honest evaluation.

As far as mainstream cinema is concerned, I think only Jaws The Revenge is a worse movie. Showgirls is a waste of every moment, every dollar, and every frame of film that was spent on it. Everyone whose name appears in the credits for this film should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.Showgirls is the story of a young woman who hitchhikes her way to Las Vegas with not a penny to her name, but eventually becomes the lead dancer in a topless show at a casino. The film is supposed to be a sexy insider's look at the business of putting on a dance show, but it is so poorly made that it comes off as being uninteresting camp. I can stand camp at certain levels, but this film really tries to take itself seriously. That is the biggest problem here, but the entire project is filled with problems.Joe Eszterhas has written some amazingly successful scripts in his day. Most of the films are awful, but ultimately profitable. Almost everything he has written has been watchable if nothing else. Showgirls isn't even watchable. Once the nudity has gotten old (and that is within the first half hour) there is nothing left to keep the viewer's interest at anything more than a curiosity level. You're left with nothing to do but see just how much worse the dialog will get, and just how pathetic people can act. The film is not entertaining in any stretch of the word. It just becomes a study in how not to make a movie.The acting is so bad you can only laugh at it. Elizabeth Berkley is every bit as awful as you've heard, but even she isn't as bad a some of the other main characters. Take for example Glenn Plummer. This guy is so terrible in his pointless role that the entire film grinds to a catastrophic halt every moment he's on the screen. Plummer was one of the worst actors to appear in mainstream films in the 1990s, and his lack of talent is really on display in this one. There are some characters who are interesting in a sense that you maybe want to know a little more about them, but there was not one good performance in the entire film. How is a viewer supposed to care about a film when they don't even care about a single character?The screenplay takes one ridiculous turn after the next. The sex scenes are not the least bet sexy, and this is surprising coming from an Eszterhas script. I don't think Basic Instinc or Sliver were great films, but at least there were some sexually charged scenes in those films. Not in this one. Not one. There is also a rape scene so badly choreographed and over the top that Michael Winner (the Death Wish series director) would have been embarrassed to use it. How about some of this dialog? You can f*ck me when you love me! She doesn't suck. She learned it all right. But whatever she learned, they don't teach it! ???????Overall Showgirls must be viewed by everyone at least once in their lives. To see how NOT to make a film, there is no better guide. There's a reason this thing didn't gross half of what it cost to make. And with all of those beautiful nude women it still isn't even watchable. Amazing.2 of 10 stars So sayeth the Hound.

The plot is poorly put together and almost entirely pushed into the background to show the viewer nudity, instead of actual film. I suppose there needs to be some T&A flicks every now and then, but this is too long, pointless, and has too little sex and nudity. I guess Paul Verhoeven set out to make a T&A flick, and either didn't know exactly how to do it and figured he'd inject some plot too, or he felt it would be too empty with only nudity. The result is too boring for fans of T&A flicks, and too simple for anyone else. The problem is, we don't care about any of the characters; we just want one of two things to see them naked, or to have the film move on and be more entertaining. Unfortunately, neither is done to the point of satisfaction. There is too little nudity and sex in the film, and too many badly developed, boring and pointless characters. The film has some decent nudity and sex scenes, but they are too far apart and the film is far too long. It would have been better had it just been 90 minutes, and nothing but T&A, instead of trying to make it watchable to people who want more than just nudity. I liked a few of the scenes that involved nudity and/or sex, and I enjoyed one of the last scenes which has the main character taking the law into her own hands, but apart from that, this is pointless.

But several melodramas break out in her life, including people throwing up, a rivalry with Gina Gershon (well, this movie wasn't allllll bad), and other countless episodes that are dumb and poorly acted. This movie was the first movie to achieve (and it was proud of achieving it) the NC-17 rating and attempt to become a commercial success. Back in the 1960s and 70s, many movies rated X had done well, including winning an Oscar for best picture (Midnight Cowboy), but since the NC-17 rating came out, no movie had attempted to be a success with that rating. Showgirls had a lot of buzz over the fact that it was dirty, racy, sexy, and it was, but also had a weak story and terrible acting and directing. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Starship Troopers), Showgirls is a mess, maybe because it has too many melodramatic subplots that just did not work. The failing of this film has had a lasting legacy on Hollywood, no other NC-17 movie has been as mass-marketed as Showgirls, and several movies have been re-edited to avoid the rating (Eyes Wide Shut, Kill Bill come to mind). There is a lot of nudity, lots of sex, and more than earns its NC-17 rating. Too bad they didn't put as much effort into the rest of the film as they did in making the girls look good. To be fair, Showgirls has earned a cult following, for reasons that are beyond me, but there are people out there who appreciated something about the film.

This is all fine but the problem is that they delivered a sometimes hilarious movie that misses on so many levels that it's easy to see why some trashed it while others hold it up as a cult item. At the heart of it this is a story about a poor girl from a troubled background who wants to make a name for herself and achieve her dreams. There's nothing wrong with this but the biggest problem with the film and its screenplay is that Nomi is such an annoying, ugly and rather bitchy character that you really don't want her to succeed and you don't care for her at all.To me, the biggest flaw with SHOWGIRLS is the fact that you can't stand the lead character and this here is just a fatal flaw since you're supposed to be rooting for her. Another problem is that Berkley just wasn't the right person for the role. She just comes across as someone who can't act and there's no doubt that the role itself was just too demanding. I mean, physically she can handle the dancing and you can believe she's tough but the dramatic scenes are downright embarrassing and there are some moments throughout that just seem like goof outtakes instead of a real performance. While this film ended Berkley's film career, it's probably not fair to blame her since she's not the one who hired herself. The blame should certainly go to the director.The supporting performances contain some real gems including Gershon who steals the show with her sexy and at times exciting performance as the star who likes to toy with the new girl. Kyle MacLachlan is also very good in his cocky role and Robert Davi is terrific as a low-life strip club owner. The film also offers up a very good soundtrack, some terrific cinematography and there's no question that there's a lot gloss to the movie. On a technical level the film is quite impressive and there's no question that Verhoeven has an eye for style and knows how to get that on the screen.With that said, there's just too much that is wrong with the picture. I'm really not sure what the entire point was or exactly what they were wanting to get across but in the end the film is just one great big mess. SHOWGIRLS isn't the worst movie ever made and it certainly doesn't deserve its reputation but no matter how many times you view it, the film will always be seen as a disaster.

Within the first twenty minutes, I'm glad to say, I completely agreed with the critics about this sexploitation film, from Razzie winning director Paul Verhoeven (RoboCop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers). Basically Nomi Malone (twice Razzie winning and debuting Elizabeth Berkley), a mysterious young girl, has come from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to become a dancer. Six weeks pass since meeting new friend, Stardust Hotel dress maker Molly Abrams (Gina Ravera), Nomi finds work as a lap dancer in the seedy Cheetah Club. While working there she meets Cristal Connors (Bound's Razzie nominated Gina Gershon), star of Goddess, the successful topless show at the Stardust Hotel, and her boyfriend, entertainment director Zack Carey (Blue Velvet's Razzie nominated Kyle MacLachlan). There comes an opportunity for Nomi to join the Goddess chorus line of girls, dancing behind Cristal, and she leaps at the chance to audition to become a showgirl. This audition was arranged by Cristal, who is attracted to her, and Nomi finds out that fame comes at a price as her friendships, her morals and attitude are put to the test. Nomi is now a showgirl, but tries to convince herself that she is not a hooker, but she and all the others clearly are, and her spending the night with Zack proves that. It is after being with Zack that the makers of Goddess look for an understudy for Cristal, and Nomi is clearly the favourite, but Cristal makes sure that Nomi won't steal her part. Nomi is frustrated, and shoves Cristal down the stairs, both as revenge for her nastiness and to steal the leading role, to become the star of Goddess. With her newfound stardom, Nomi is invited to glitzy events, including a party where Molly's favourite singer, Andrew Carver (William Shockley), will be, but he turns out to be a bastard when he rapes Molly. Worse is to come when Zack discovers the truth about Nomi and her past, her real name is Polly Ann Costello, she is a runaway prostitute who was caught for taking drugs, prostitution and assault with a deadly weapon, and her father killed her mother and then himself. In the end, Nomi decides that she should return to her life in Los Angeles, but not before avenging Molly by beating up Carver, and saying goodbye to her, and Cristal. Also starring Glenn Plummer as James Smith, Licence to Kill's Razzie nominated Robert Davi as Al Torres, Razzie nominated Alan Rachins as Tony Moss, Razzie nominated Lin Tucci as Henrietta 'Mama' Bazoom and Rena Riffel as Penny / Hope. This film is a big hit with cult audiences and the late night movie circuit, and admittedly the two best scenes are Berkley's striptease to MacLachlan, and the two of them rapidly shagging in the swimming pool. This film was also a big hit at the Anti-Oscars, the Golden Raspberry Awards, or Razzies, where it received the record thirteen nominations to celebrate how bad it is. It does have a plot line that you could follow if you cared, but you don't, especially when the leading character has such an attitude problem, you just know that it is pointless viewing and a rubbish erotic drama, but you could argue, it's so bad it's good. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Original Song for Walk Into The Wind, Worst Screen Couple for Any combination of two people (or two body parts!), and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Remake or Sequel (remake of both All About Eve and The Lonely Lady). It was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Poor!

I've probably seen this movie more than any other in my whole life. I started watching it when I was just 5 years old, in 1997 when my mom sat me down and had me watch it with her. Everyday coming back from preschool and kindergarten I'd watch this movie, sometimes twice in a row. But then my mom had me stop watching it. As I grew older into my teens, I watched it again, I understood a lot more and I still loved the movie. I love the friendship and just the whole, unrealistic...fantasy feel it gives off. I was honestly shocked when I found out how low this movie was rated and how many bashings it'd taken. In all my life as being a little girl, a teen, a woman, I've never felt offended or exploited really, from watching this movie. I love the characters, the plot, everything. It gives me the same feeling as the story Sundays at Tiffany's. Just that warm...soft feeling. I really do recommend this movie to anyone. It's worth watching.

Actually that was two lines and they both could have come out of one of those 1980 talking Chrysler K-models. I studied this movie after watching Burn Hollywood Burn, which I rather liked. You can sure see why this bombed. The characters are as tortured as the Eastern European architecture where the writer grew up. And I am not saying complex. I am saying grimy and dirty and crumbling. Not even the low-maintenance reinforced-concrete Eastern European. I am saying failed nation-state lost-to-communism Eastern European architecture. Who wants to watch these people?

Why did the guy dancer love-interest have to be black? Sure kumbaya, diversity, and Hungarians weren't Nazis, but why throw all the box office below the Mason Dixon into the trash? It pisses off the blacks even more than it does the rednecks. After all, its pretty hard to lose money on soft-core porn, but he managed, he sure managed to do that. He says she walked away from it at the end so we should like it. No, she is an amalgam of cardboard and plastic and I wanted to see her punished for wasting 2 hours of my life.

The lesson of this movie Raw tits can't substitute for character development, a compelling plot, or sympathetic characters. Maybe America should not be exterminated. I will admit that this movie has a lot of tits. A heap of tits. A whole heap of 'em.Two stars since it was twice as good as Leaving Las Vegas. It was just as depressing, but it did have a heap of tits.*Gratuitous Departed reference.**Third act comes a little late huh?

And its release last year came at a time when Senator Bob Dole and other politicians chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence. But if Showgirls is any indication of Hollywood's future, the folks in Washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to American values--bad movie-making.Showgirls is a relentlessly exploitive look at the Las Vegas strip scene, and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter. Director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas, who collaborated on another shock-value project, 1992's Basic Instinct, follow the plight of a young woman (teen TV star Elizabeth Berkley) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer. It's a hackneyed premise to begin with, so not surprisingly, all of the stock characters are trucked out. There's the Demanding Producer. The Loyal Friend. The Bitchy Competitor. Lest I forget the Scummy Club Owner.Of course, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity. Unfortunately, Showgirls doesn't satisfy in this department. Verhoeven's slam-bang, in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic. To make matters worse, you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes, which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history. Verhoeven and Ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground, but if it's adult entertainment you want, stay home and watch the Playboy Channel.

Let me count them1) Elizabeth Berkley can't act and looks dreadful.2) The pool sequence with her and Kyle MacLachlan is just SO terrible.3) The script is poor with some eye-rolling dialogue.4) Gina Gershon's looks when Berkeley gives MacLachlan a lap dance are hysterically funny. 5) All the women are portrayed as evil b****es who will do ANYTHING to succeed. 6) The one kind woman in the film is gang-raped into a coma! 7) She's still IN a coma by the end of the movie--we never find out what happened to her.8) You don't care about any of the characters or situations.9) It ends with a scene that had me wanting to throw something hard at the screen.I saw this opening night in Boston. The theatre was sold out and I was stuck next to a college kid who was just there to see the nudity. By the end of the film he was cringing away from the screen with a look of disgust on his face. He said he found all the characters so repulsive that he couldn't enjoy the nudity. Remember--this is a COLLEGE kid!The only good thing about this mess is Gina Gershon. She's actually very funny. She also said the movie should have been promoted as a comedy.The top problems with this is the script, indifferent direction by Paul Verhoeven (hard to believe he did this) and the lousy acting by Berkley. Too repulsive to be funny. A must-miss. "}]
