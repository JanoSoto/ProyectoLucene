[{"Title":"Barry Levinson's Funny, Poignant Look at Changing Times in an Era That Needed Change!","Date":"15 June 2004","Score":"17 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  LIBERTY HEIGHTS (LH) is a fine addition to writer/director Barry Levinson's series of nostalgic autobiographical Baltimore-set films. This episodic but heartfelt comedy-drama, set in the mid-1950s, stars Adrien Brody and Ben Foster as brothers Van and Ben Kurtzman, who come of age while grappling with anti-Semitism, their loving dad's (Joe Mantegna) shady business dealings (he runs both a burlesque house and a low-profile numbers racket.  My late dad, a bookie, would've loved this guy! -), racism (Ben and his pretty black classmate Sylvia, appealingly played by Rebekah Johnson, start seeing each other on the sly), and classism (Van falls hard for blonde WASP dream girl Dubbie, who turns out to be a nightmare -- a tragic figure, in fact -- but is capably played by supermodel Carolyn Murphy in her first and, to date, only film role that I know of).  While LH isn't quite as sharp and knowing as Levinson's modern classic DINER (with which LH would make an interesting double feature; the DVD includes the DINER trailer, by the way), it's rendered with great affection and attention to detail about the characters, their world, and the changing times they're living in. For me, the wittier moments really made the film -- Ben's anarchic streak livens things up, to say the least!  Best Ben moments 1) his scandalizing his family by dressing as Hitler on Halloween; 2) the act of defiance he and his friends eventually pull at the NO JEWS... pool; and 3) the tender yet chaste kiss he gives Sylvia at graduation, freaking out both sets of parents.  LH is worth a rental, at the very least!

The story was set in the mid-1950s, accurately looks the part, and is actually three tales involving the three males in a middle class family. Yes, there is the treatment of racism and the self-consciousness that it spawns on both sides, and yes, the death throes of anti-semitism (at least among decent people). A middle-aged man finds he has outlived the world in which he came to prosper, and does not know what to do. There is something else the grass is always greener hypothesis in ethnic/social class mixing. One of the protagonists meets his shiksa goddess and her lot, longs to cross a divide he does his best to bridge -- and finds his betters have feet of clay for all their poise and social standing.LIBERTY HEIGHTS is in the best sense a North American story. Leaving one's ghetto, the benefits of learning to do so, and creation of a better world. Note how toward the end, the flawed and even cruel W.A.S.P. society boy becomes better for having accepted the hand of friendship of someone his father might have avoided.

By this I don't mean that it lacks substance, in fact, it has plenty, but I mean rather that it does not involve an intense plot line. It's more like a series of snapshots taken out of one family's album, like a brief recording of one year in their lives.  It's as if these people were real, simply going about their lives in their times, and we got to peek in on them, and it is acted in just that way.  I think it's very true to director Barry Levinson's vision, a vision that is clear upon  viewing his other films that he includes with Liberty Heights as his Baltimore films. These include Diner, Avalon, and Tin Men.  Because this is not the typical problem arises-conflict ensues-climax is reached-conclusion is found film, Levinson shows us that these people's lives were a series of ups and downs, joys and losses, that summarize American middle-class youth in all ages in history.  There connections between the different walks of life and the idea of growing up and discovering diversity around you is what makes this film universal and beautiful, all without handing you morals and themes on a silver platter.  This film takes a wonderfully objective viewpoint that allows you to make meaning of it rather than spelling it out for you.

This film is about the Jewish Kurtzman family, but we follow the father and his two sons as three separate stories.  Each one of them having their own struggle and challenges to face.  What struck me as the most amazing part of the story was the easiness of it, how it flowed and gently tackled serious issues in the community of that time.  It portrait itself in a realistic manner, where there were no real baddies or large showdown, just people going through life.

The movie is a great portrayal of how things looked like in America in the 50's, showing religious, racial, social and other differences and also showing how these differences can easily be overcome once a person realizes(or as was the case in this movie-doesn't even consider) that different only and always means worse.    Ben Foster steals the show from the first scene and Adrien Brody is in close second place. And because they had such screen persona, or power if you will, I found if distracting and a bit out of place when at the end the story shifted too much to Joe Mantegna, their movie father. I have much respect for the man, he's an immense and always fun-to-watch actor, but in this movie it was him that was overshadowed, which is ironic since HE was the one who usually did this. A great, lightheaded growing-up movie that begins and ends with a nostalgic note, once again making me wish I'd have a chance to live in that day and age.

It is very much a slice of life movie and provokes serious thought about growing up and the meaning of prejudice and racial barriers. It is  a lovely film and I have resolved to see some other efforts from Barry Levinson as his is a rare talent.  He lovingly captures Baltimore in the fifties in all its facets of neighbourhoods, the cast is stellar, not a false note among them, the music is wonderful and all the plot lines come together.  I felt sad that it was over, I found myself quite involved with the characters who were multi dimensional with teasing snippets of background as in the disturbed Dubbie saying to Van she did not like spending time with her father and his boyfriend. And Sylvia's family being black and wealthiest by far than the others and she was following her mother and grandmother into a Black College so she could preserve the continuance. 8 out of 10.

Although unexceptional in terms of it's standard coming of age plotline, as the film progresses it becomes increasingly thoughtful and observant.  It is the small details that make LIBERTY HEIGHTS seem so rich--and I wouldn't dream of giving any of them away--but needless to say, by the end of the film anyone who remembers their childhood fondly is bound to leave the theatre with a smile on their face.  In a quiet and unassuming way, the movie manages to throw out many messages to its audience.  Every single subplot in the film relates back to the family.  Joe Mantegna plays the racketeering patriarch of a nice uppper-middle class Jewish family that resembles a lighter version of the Corleone's in THE GODFATHER.  One of the sons falls for a Catholic girl, while the other pursues the black daughter of a prominent city doctor.  They all live with their grandmother who is blinded to the gentiles by the Holocaust.  The relationships between the youngsters naturally conflict with the views of their parents, and they are forced to form their own opinions on racial boundaries. What is so refreshing about LIBERTY HEIGHTS is that it doesn't pull obvious punches or go for the cheap thrills that more sensationalized Hollywood films normally would.  Not even in a subplot with an eccentric drug dealer do the characters resort to violence as might be expected with this sort of material.  The characters in LIBERTY HEIGHTS are just ordinary people in relatively ordinary situations.  It is not a fast paced film, some may find the midsection to be a little over-inflated.  Personally I enjoyed the film a great deal.  It grew on me to the point that by the end I was drawn to tears.  Even fully aware of its old fashioned Hollywood corniness the movie touched a nerve with me.  I found the performances very moving--in particular that of young Ben Foster, who we should exepect to see again in the near future.  Adrien Brody is appealing and sympathetic as the eldest son.  Bebe Neuwirth manages to create some interesting moments in her role as matriarch of the Kurtzman family--particularly in the final scene.  LIBERTY HEIGHTS is not a perfect film to be sure, but in a season with a shortage of intelligent family oriented films LIBERTY HEIGHTS is a solid bet.

The love story between Ben and Sylvia is especially moving to every white boy who ever fell in love with a black girl before it was acceptable, and most of the credit goes to the enchanting Rebekah Johnson. Older brother Van's travels in WASPland are more cliche-ridden, though one must salute the acting of Adrien Brody and his friend Trey, who actually make their unlikely friendship believable. Trey's deb girlfriend is pure cardboard. The real standouts here are Joe Mantegna and Orlando Jones going toe-to-toe in dangerously caricaturish territory. Both manage to pull it off. One anachronistic comment- Scribbles calls one of Nick's men the Pillsbury Jewboy--far as I know that advertising icon didn't appear till 10 years after the film's 1954-55 setting. Again, no one will call this film a classic, but seen as part of a 4 film whole (Tin Men is more the aberration than Liberty Heights) it stands proudly and pulls at these 40 year old heartstrings from a very similar North Bronx background.

Some did not live up to these expectations (Man on the Moon, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Being John Malkovich), others did (American Beauty, The Insider).  One particular film though entered very quietly with little fanfare and turned out to be a gem and is maintaining its stay at theaters along with the big guns.  That film is the wonderful, intelligent and funny Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth in his Baltimore series (Diner, Tin Men, Avalon).  Like those films Levinson relies on great dialogue, real characters and good actors to bring it all to life (again its amazing how that works).Liberty Heights explores the issues of race, class and religion mainly through the eyes and experiences of two Jewish brothers, college student Van Kurtzman (Adrien Brody) and his younger brother, Ben (Ben Foster) during 1954.  They live in the predominately Jewish community of Forest Park with their parents (Mantegna and Neuwirth) along with their grandmother.  Their father owns a burlesque house and runs the local numbers business.  They are a relatively normal loving middle class family.  But both brothers are beginning to explore the outside world of their Jewish circle and the changes that are taking place within the world.  While eldest brother Van is breaking class barriers by pursing a rich upper class socialite, Ben is knocking down the color barrier by starting a relationship with a pretty black classmate.  Eventually all their worlds collide to varying degrees and both boys learn and grow along the way.  This is a wonderful heartfelt picture with none of the sentimentality that marred The Green Mile.  It is honest with its emotions and does not force them or any message onto the audience.  Liberty Heights is a true delight and a must see for those who are pursuing all those big guns in the theaters now.Levinson has created such a rich and wonderful universe that is so real and has chosen a near perfect cast to pull it off.  The always-reliable Joe Mantegna as Nate gives a good, solid performance as the patriarch of the Kurtzman family.  He is a strong and loving figure for his family and Mantegna does a good job of it.  The very talented Neuwirth also does fine work and Richard Kline who was awful as Jack's buddy in the TV show Three's Company does an outstanding job as Nat's business partner Charlie, but this picture belongs to the brothers (Brody and especially the young Foster).  Brody who has proven himself to be an up-and-coming actor (The Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) should have a long shelf life compared to some of his flash in the pan contemporaries.  His performance shows a very focused and compelling character.  But the acting of Ben Foster is pure joy and he carries the picture and lights up the screen every time he appears with his very natural and charismatic performance.  This is one talented actor who I hope to see more of in the future.  Although both Brody and Foster do not have the so called movie star good looks they are in a league of their own as far as talent is concerned.  We need less pretty faces that can't act and more of their kind.Although Liberty Heights does not have any of the hype of the other pictures and the acting and directing do not have Oscar written all over them, it is still a great picture that stands tall and can go head to head with all the major contenders out there.  Do yourself a favor and check out this wonderful picture, you will not be disappointed.   Highly Recommended.× × × × out of 5  "},{"Title":"terrific movie, well written and acted","Date":"2 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  This is a fine little movie, the kind we expect from Barry Levinson.

Both are on journeys of self-discovery, the older brother with hostile WASP gentiles, the younger with African-Americans. Both fall for girls from opposing racial camps.  In Liberty Heights, Levinson again lovingly recreates 1950s Baltimore. You can tell he knows the lay of the land; it's etched in his heart.

Nate owns a burlesque house long after burlesque has gone out of fashion, and runs a numbers game on the side, constantly risking charges. Meanwhile, Van and Ben deal with anti-Semitic feelings (swimming pools with signs that read NO JEWS, DOGS OR COLOREDS ALLOWED), but at the same time also deal with the changes brought about by integration, making friends and making tentative steps toward romances with those of other ethnic groups. We get a sense throughout of the difficulty that people must have felt in being asked to give up long-standing social conditioning, and we see (perhaps unrealistically) that the young people are far more willing to break out of these restrictions than their parents.The movie isn't all that exciting, but does provide an interesting slice-of-life perspective that makes it worth watching.

It was the most real, most heartfelt, and most memorable. I put on LH thinking it would be okay, and was shocked to see it just about right up there with Diner for all the same reasons. If you've seen Scorsese's The Bronx Tale with DeNiro, you might notice a resemblance, down to the forbidden teen interracial love plot. In Bronx Tale, the mob has a part, but with nothing terribly eventful. In both, the family and everyday storyline take precedence, as if the mob aspects were afterthoughts. I can't say that the Jewish Mob background did LH justice, as Montagna just seemed too wishy-washy to be a front-line mobster. Montagna is a great actor, but I think he should have brought a little harder edge to the mob-orientated moments. He did fine as a father, though he could have had any occupation and the movie would not have been any the less for it. I strongly feel that if the movie did not have the mob element in it, and Montagna had a conventional occupation, the movie would have been perfect, and even more realistic than it was. The burlesque scenes again were a drag on what otherwise would have been a perfect coming of age film.This movie comes very close to Diner quality, if not for the somewhat flawed mob subplots....well worth seeing though!

When Ben and a young black girl (Rebekah Johnson) become friends, she ends up hiding him in her bedroom closet - though they were just listening to music - because her father won't let her have white friends. Then Van can't understand why his mother won't let him out of the house dressed as Adolf Hitler on Halloween. And the boys have a special way of handling a pool that doesn't allow Jews.Very effective performances from all involved, with Joe Mantagna wonderful as the patriarch of the family, who runs a burlesque house, then gets into numbers, and encounters a headache named Little Melvin.Though phrases like colored and Jew me down are used in Liberty Heights to show the strength of prejudice, sadly, while people may be more careful of their language today, some of these feelings are still held by many. One only has to hear the drunken outbursts of Mel Gibson or the tirade from Michael Richards to know it's so.So the more things change, the more they remain the same. The boys in Liberty Heights look for love, get into trouble, and learn responsibility, just as kids do today. Nevertheless, Levinson paints a great picture of life in the '50s and people's beliefs.

Liberty Heights, while not perfect, fills the void for at least 2 hours.The film tells three interconnected stories involving the Kurtzman family Nate (Joe Mantegna), Ada (a criminally underused Bebe Neuwirth), Van (Adrien Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster). Ben runs an illegal numbers racket from behind the scenes of his burlesque show. Van is trying to woo a rich girl (Carolyn Murphy). Ben is romancing an African-American student, Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), to the horror of both their families (the film takes place in 1954-1955).All the actors do terrific work. None of them are in their comfort zone, and there isn't a single off performance. Joe Mantegna is solid as Nate. He's a good guy and a family man, despite his unsavory activities. Adrien Brody is also good as Van. It's a very understated performance, but we still feel for the guy. Of special note is Ben Foster. Foster has been churning out outstanding performances left and right in varied types of roles, and this is another great performance. He is so real, and the voice he uses is so different from the one he usually has. He's also immensely likable, which is especially noteworthy coming from a guy who would later play creepy psychos in Alpha Dog (where I first noticed him) and 310 to Yuma). Rebekah Johnson and Carolyn Murphy are solid as well as the pursued girls, and Orlando Jones is suitably loopy in an off-the-wall performance (Levinson keeps him, like the film, a little too muzzled, however). Justin Chambers is very good as the near-alcoholic rich kid, who isn't as bad as he seems. This is clearly a personal film for director Barry Levinson. It's another film in his Baltimore saga, but it's the first one of those movies that I've seen. After this, I'm going to check them out, but not immediately. The film is a little too understated; films that go this route have an added level of verisimilitude, but a little of this goes a long way, and especially in Adrien Brody's case, it's a little too understated to be believable. Some of the cross-cutting montages don't quite work either, although that's nitpicking (the worst example of this is in the end credits, which cuts from jazz to pop and back again with rather startling ineptitude, but this is the point where you're supposed to be turning off the TV anyway).I'd recommend the film, but only if you're really into this kind of a movie, especially since it's a little on the long side.My rating PG-13 for language and thematic material.

Ben's brother Van alsopursues a girl outside his ethnic group, however he is not taking as biga risk as his curious younger brother.  The scene in which Ben is toldoff by his mom for dressing up as Hitler is a great example ofcontradiction considering that this women who is prejudiced againstblacks is shouting at her son for dressing up as a man who was equallyprejudiced against Jews.

Unfortunately, Levinson doesn't quite relay these ideals as well as hecould have.  Instead, he insists on familiarizing us with the illegalgoings on of Ben's father in a mild strip club.

I enjoyed this movie for many of the same reasons that I enjoyed My Dog Skip. Both of them deal with the everyday life of growing up and dealing with an ambiguous and changing world. I rate this film a solid 8 of 10.CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --This film, about 2 hours, set in NW Baltimore in 1954 and 1955, tells three primary stories in parallel. Ben is the high school senior just learning that not all the world is Jewish, and first learns what prejudice and discrimination are. The sign at the local swimming hole -- No Jews, Dogs, or Coloreds. His older brother, Van, falls for a non-Jew, a temperamental blonde, and he eventually finds out she is not as perfect as she seems to be. And their father, who runs a Burlesk theater and a numbers game on the side, always managing to duck the law. Until a black drug dealer happens to win $100,000 dollars that can't be covered, and they go into business together. He eventually has to go to jail. The main story is Ben's, and he first gets exposed to a colored girl in his school through integration. Her prayerful attitude catches his attention, and they become friends. There is a funny scene where her father comes home early and Ben is in the closet, and they converse. Another where they go to the same James Brown concert but not on a date. And the very last scene right after graduation, where they say goodbye, he kisses her for the first time, just as friends, and both sets of parents go off the deep end. A nice touch.There isn't much action, no one gets killed or even badly beat up. The characters seem real, and this film offers a portal through which we can view a little of what it was like growing up and dealing with racism at the same time, all the while keeping a sense of humor.

Again, only one character, a bit character who is announcing names at graduation, had a Baltimore accent.  (I just don't get Levinson; if you film in Baltimore, educate your actors to use local dialect.)  Also, the film did not depict enough people smoking; everyone and anyone smoked cigarettes, especially in the 1950's.  I am frankly surprised the boys and their friends weren't at least sneaking a smoke.  However, the storyline was greatly thought out.

The subplot, for example, about the local thug Little Melvin holding the teens hostage for ransom was ridiculous, especially since nobody seemed very stressed out, and the incident was never reported to the police. Somehow the casting of Montegna and Neuwirth as the parents never rang true. Adrien Brody and Ben Foster as brothers? Didn't seem authentic.

As a period piece, this is outstanding.  As a comedy/drama, it has its moments but is too scattered to have much impact.  The story follows the lives of Nate Kurtzman (Joe Mantegna), and his two sons, Van (Adrian Brody) and Ben (Ben Foster) over the period of one year.  Nate's subplot showed his life as a small-time racketeer.  Van develops a crush on a wealthy gentile girl at a party, and spends much of the film pining after her.  When he finally gets to know her better he finds that she is much different than he had imagined.  Ben develops a crush on a black girl in his class and embarks on a friendship with her that flies in the face of the taboos of the times. The entire film revolved around a single theme, i.e. how hard it was to grow up Jewish in the 1950's.  Much of the material was amusing, some disturbing and some charming, but Levinson was so intent on relieving (or reliving) his angst that he kept wandering from the main storylines.  If he had focused the story more on the relationship between Ben and Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), it would have been a much stronger film.As a period piece on the &#145;50's, this is outstanding.  The costumes and props were perfect and the entire film had a genuine 50's feeling to it.  Levinson captured not only the images, but also the attitudes.The ensemble cast was very solid.  Joe Montegna is always terrific, especially when he is playing a crook.  He is extremely believable in those roles and though he has tried to break out of the type, he keeps coming back because he does it so well.  Ben Foster gave a wonderful performance played with a great deal of wit and sensitivity.  He and Rebekah Johnson had excellent chemistry and made the forbidden relationship enchanting.This film had potential, but Levinson' mission to expose injustice kept distracting him from the storyline and dissipated its overall effect.  I rated it 6/10.  Add a point if you are Jewish and another if you are nostalgic about the 1950's.  Not bad, but it could have been much better.

The Baltimore setting, the diner scenes, the close-ups on car hood ornaments, and other touches serve as identification markers of its author.  It is interesting to see Levinson put Baltimore in quite a different light than he did in the TV series Homicide. Liberty Heights follows the predictable plot-line of many coming-of-age movies, where things happen and then people talk about them.  I kept waiting for something really bad to happen, someone to be killed or dragged before the HUAC, but nothing terrible happens at all. But far from spoiling the film, it allows the viewer to concentrate on the characters' experience and the changing direction of their lives. This is a film about Baltimore's distinct ethnic groups in the 1950's, but there is no sharp edge to it.  Rather, Liberty Heights shows hope for tolerance and the breakdown of sharp socio-economic boundaries.  The message is not hammered home; it's just there for the grasping if you wish to see it this way.  Otherwise, it's a pleasantly diverting soap opera with typically Levinsonian cinematography, editing, and use of music.

Glossy, friendly story of wry humor and heartache in turbulent times of change gets careful, loving treatment from writer-director Barry Levinson, who obviously has great affection for this time and place. Levinson examines the intricate, often touchy relationships between the two minority groups, the Jews and the blacks--apparently there were no gays in 1950s Baltimore--versus the wealthy white Gentiles. It's all taken with abrasive sugar and spice (and lots of comically clueless talk of sex), yet some of these paths are familiar. There's the sensitive, handsome Jew who falls for the cool blonde society beauty (a deceptive package); his brother develops a crush on a black girl in his class, whose father forbids her to see him again; the Jewish patriarch, a burlesque club manager, runs a numbers racket with a black partner and gets arrested. Levinson's script is well-written, and his cast is likable, but these episodes are like reruns--right down to the nosy Jewish Bubby and the white boys' first trip to an all-black rock and roll show.

I interpreted it mostly as a look at the changing world - namely school integration - that the family inhabits. The movie looks at racism Nate and his friends are selling their business to African-American fast talker Melvin (Orlando Jones (happy birthday, Orlando!)), which the authorities clearly don't like. But it also looks at anti-Semitism there's a particularly memorable scene in which a Jewish teenager pretends to be Scandinavian (and I mean all of Scandinavia).

Some did not live up to these expectations (Man on the Moon, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Being John Malkovich), others did (American Beauty, The Insider).  One particular film though entered very quietly with little fanfare and turned out to be a gem and is maintaining its stay at theaters along with the big guns.  That film is the wonderful, intelligent and funny Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth in his Baltimore series (Diner, Tin Men, Avalon).  Like those films Levinson relies on great dialogue, real characters and good actors to bring it all to life (again its amazing how that works).Liberty Heights explores the issues of race, class and religion mainly through the eyes and experiences of two Jewish brothers, college student Van Kurtzman (Adrien Brody) and his younger brother, Ben (Ben Foster) during 1954.  They live in the predominately Jewish community of Forest Park with their parents (Mantegna and Neuwirth) along with their grandmother.  Their father owns a burlesque house and runs the local numbers business.  They are a relatively normal loving middle class family.  But both brothers are beginning to explore the outside world of their Jewish circle and the changes that are taking place within the world.  While eldest brother Van is breaking class barriers by pursing a rich upper class socialite, Ben is knocking down the color barrier by starting a relationship with a pretty black classmate.  Eventually all their worlds collide to varying degrees and both boys learn and grow along the way.  This is a wonderful heartfelt picture with none of the sentimentality that marred The Green Mile.  It is honest with its emotions and does not force them or any message onto the audience.  Liberty Heights is a true delight and a must see for those who are pursuing all those big guns in the theaters now.Levinson has created such a rich and wonderful universe that is so real and has chosen a near perfect cast to pull it off.  The always-reliable Joe Mantegna as Nate gives a good, solid performance as the patriarch of the Kurtzman family.  He is a strong and loving figure for his family and Mantegna does a good job of it.  The very talented Neuwirth also does fine work and Richard Kline who was awful as Jack's buddy in the TV show Three's Company does an outstanding job as Nat's business partner Charlie, but this picture belongs to the brothers (Brody and especially the young Foster).  Brody who has proven himself to be an up-and-coming actor (The Thin Red Line, Summer of Sam) should have a long shelf life compared to some of his flash in the pan contemporaries.  His performance shows a very focused and compelling character.  But the acting of Ben Foster is pure joy and he carries the picture and lights up the screen every time he appears with his very natural and charismatic performance.  This is one talented actor who I hope to see more of in the future.  Although both Brody and Foster do not have the so called movie star good looks they are in a league of their own as far as talent is concerned.  We need less pretty faces that can't act and more of their kind.Although Liberty Heights does not have any of the hype of the other pictures and the acting and directing do not have Oscar written all over them, it is still a great picture that stands tall and can go head to head with all the major contenders out there.  Do yourself a favor and check out this wonderful picture, you will not be disappointed.

Yes, the Black young woman is bright and beautiful but she's right out of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a counter stereotype  rich, third generation college educated, high class.  The main image of Blacks is about as offensive as could be.  What is wrong with Barry Levinson?  Has no one told him that racial stereotyping of Blacks does damage in this country even in 2000.  The Black gangsters could just have easily been Jewish, Italian, Irish or French Canadian. Or just plain neutral.  I am Jewish and didn't like the stereotyping of Jews either, but they were not especially negative. The Black stereotypes were. I was offended and turned off.  Is Levinson just clueless?

What Levinson does remember vividly is growing up in Baltimore in the mid-1950s with discrimination toward the Jews and that is squarely where he frames Liberty Heights, a film that is both entertaining and yet unsettling to see.  The Kurtzman family live in a comfortable world of their Jewish culture but they have to live with the prejudices and hatred of the non-Jew, 'the other people'.  Levinson reminds us at every turn that this is white, Anglo-Saxon America.  The sign outside the public pool reads, 'No Jews, Dogs, or Coloreds'.  A fistfight develops because the character, Yussel, a Jew will not answer the question, 'are you a Jew?'  Later he dyes his hair blond so that he can claim to be Scandinavian and pick up a Gentile woman.  There is a strong implication that Nate Kurtzman (strongly portrayed by Joe Mantegna) was singled out for prosecution because he was a Jew. Levinson further sets up relationships between Ben (played very well by Ben Foster) and Sylvia (kudos to Rebekah Johnson) and Van (Adrien Brody) and Dubbie to show discrimination between minorities and between upper and middle class. Ben and Sylvia are an especially touching pair because we see the innocence (dressing up as a Nazi for Halloween, finding a spot on the crotch and actually talking about it) and later the defiance (they actually 'didn't do anything' and later the kiss) of two people who won't let societal mores dictate how they behave.  Levinson further juxtaposes very contrasting scenes to imbue complexity to his characters.  The father, Nate, is seen dining civilly at home after Friday Sabbath with his family as we see lewd dancers performing in his burlesque parlor.  Ben is having the time of his life in an all-Black concert jiving to James Brown even as brother Van is at a mansion party among rich kids, despondent after learning from the girl of his dreams that she belongs to someone else.  Levinson's setup of  the Jew-Black confrontation between       Nate and Little Melvin is somewhat troubling.  Levinson could not ignore the 1950s dialogue when 'colored' and 'Negro' were common words and yet he seemed to make Little Melvin     too caricatured - bug-eyed, lazy, and easy to connive.  The interchange over taking the $100,000 now or getting a piece of the numbers territory seemed to be right out of an Amos and Andy skit.  In Liberty Heights, Levinson has unloaded the personal pain and resentment of his religious discrimination in a way that fellow Jews can especially understand.  For the rest of us, perhaps that depiction was too one-sided.

Joe Mantegna and Bebe Neuwirth portray a married couple living there with two young  sons. Mantegna's character has a burlesque house which fronts for his numbers racket. His younger  son is having a sweet and innocent romance with a young African American girl much to the chagrin of her parents. His older son (Adrien Brody) is interested in a waspy debutante type (Carolyn Murphy) being dated by his close friend. When one of dad's bettors, the slick but not too bright, Orlando Jones, wins $100,000 which he can't pay, events take a turn for the dangerous. The undercurrents of prejudice and bigotry which were just hinted at  in Levinson's earlier entries, here are explored through humor and character. However, something is missing. The story seems to be leading toward a crescendo of incident which never occurs. The youthful performers here are appealing and their first experiences in the world of sex and romance are entertaining, but they just don't go anywhere. Bebe Neuwirth, so special in her Broadway performance in `Chicago', is here miscast. Joe Mantegna does a creditable job creating the character of the father who is given an interesting history by Levinson. `Liberty Heights' needed a little of the darker side, which Levinson's TV show `Homicide Life on the Streets' was so effective at, and a little less of the light side, so well portrayed in the earlier film, `Avalon'.

The crowd seemed very excited and cheered from the begining, however, these cheers slowly died down as the film continued to go on. It was just too long. Worst of all, not only was it long but nothing BIG happened. It was like an episode of a soap opera, the episode right before the finale, where the plot builds up and is specifically developed but nothing fantastic erupts from it. Adrien Brody and  an unexpected Orlando Jones stand out with excellent performances. The fourth film of Levinson's Baltimore Series (Diner, Tin Men, Avalon fill the other three spots) is funny, sad, and, unfortunately, long.

I thought it'd be merely a series of boring vignettes like BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS. Instead, LIBERTY HEIGHTS was interesting, intelligent and fairly original as these things go. The characters were compelling, the soundtrack wonderful (though the score was a little too schmaltzy), and the acting...Well, the two actors with the most screen time were, in a word, excellent. It was obvious in 1999 that Adrien Brody was bound for stardom (this was first evident in SUMMER OF SAM, released earlier the same year). A terrific, subtle actor, the man oozes understated charm, and the camera loves that beautiful beak of his.  (Note to self  Next on my Brody rent list is Soderbergh's KING OF THE HILL.  Hope he's actually in the movie, so I won't be disappointed like I was with NEW YORK STORIES.)  But if I had to pick a lead actor among the ensemble cast of LIBERTY HEIGHTS, it would not be Brody. It'd be his onscreen brother Ben Foster (last seen in Six Feet Under as the most recent of Claire's boyfriends). This kid (sorry, anyone born in the 1980s is a kid to me) has got some seriously underused acting chops. When he wasn't onscreen I kept wanting the movie to get back to his story, and the wise script had only partly to do with that. Good thing he didn't take the Freddie Prinze route to his career; hopefully this means Foster will always be able to find roles in movies that matter.While the guys' performances (including Joe Mantegna and even Orlando Jones) were terrific, the women's weren't quite as. Bebe Neuwirth, as the mother was adequate (though it seemed a little odd seeing her as Brody's mom, considering she's only fourteen years older than he and they both had half-nude scenes in SUMMER OF SAM). But the love interests of the brothers, despite being superficially attractive, lacked screen presence and the ability to deliver their lines with conviction. I wasn't surprised to learn from IMDb that one is primarily a singer, the other a model.Allow me to go off topic and note, for no reason, that several actors in LIBERTY HEIGHTS have appeared together in other moviesAdrien Brody & Bebe Neuwirth SUMMER OF SAMDavid Krumholtz & Anthony Anderson TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAMEKevin Sussman & Gideon Jacobs WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMERMarty Lodge & Jan Austell RANDOM HEARTSWhat's up with that? These aren't even counting the presumably local Baltimore actors who have been cast in both John Waters and Barry Levinson movies. Does this happen often and I just don't notice it?And we're back. As in TIN MEN, Levinson indulges here his fetishistic love for the cars of the '50s (the final shot is of a gleaming white Cadillac in a dealership's showroom). The songs of the era - from James Brown to Frank Sinatra - are used as character development instead of just cheap nostalgia. The script is clear-eyed about what it wants to say about life back then, dealing with bigotry and the effects of a newly integrated society, and doesn't view the past through rose-colored glasses. It just tells it like it was, honestly and without judgment. One theme of the movie I responded to was how we idealize the object of our affection. It's never nice to realize your Cinderella who looks like a demure Anna Nicole Smith sans vacuousness can turn out to be a boozy nymphet with low self-esteem (like, say, Anna Nicole Smith).LIBERTY HEIGHTS does have its flaws. The editing could have been smoother (some scenes seem to end before they should), and there feels to be about ten minutes of deleted scenes that may have strengthened the characters' relationships (the only one on the DVD isn't one of them). And I didn't quite buy the details in one sequence concerning a financial transaction. But these imperfections are not major enough to ruin the movie.7/10 "},{"Title":"Good, but not hitting any heights","Date":"8 October 2000","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  An unhurried movie set in early 1950's Baltimore, with love crosses highlighting anti-semitism and racism. It never really makes any major points on these issues, but rather sticks to storytelling. However, for a rambling story of this sort with no major events and no big punchline, something needs to be exceptional for it to rise above the average. The acting is competent but not exceptional. There are one or two good lines of dialogue but very few to make you sit up and think. The music is nice but doesn't ring in our ears afterwards. Levinson has made some excellent movies such as Wag the Dog, but he seems slightly unequal to this labour of love. The overall ambience and speed is reminiscent of movies like Magnolia but that had lots of special ingredients - this one, sadly, doesn't seem to - at least for me.

That was the post-war period of major and rapid transitions. Television (in its black and white golden years) was replacing radio as the medium for soaps, dramas and comedies. Most movie theaters started featuring air conditioning as a major attraction, and room air conditioners were just beginning to pop up in windows throughout the America. After the war years, when all of manufacturing had been limited to the war effort, many new products and materials were available to consumers, including 45 and LP records and hi-fi stereo sets, home freezers and frozen food, plastics, and non-stop transcontinental air traffic. Levittown had just begun the era of planned communities and high-rise apartment building projects were being built in an effort to provide low rent urban housing. Popular singers such as Perry Como and Patti Page were being replaced by Elvis Presley and rock and roll music by black singers such as Bill Haley and then James Brown.It was the era in which the Supreme Court ruled on Brown vs Board of Education and Pres. Eisenhower sent troops to Arkansas to enforce school desegregation.This was really a pretty short era. The era ended with the social revolutions of the 1960s, after a new generation of Black intellectuals decided Dr. Martin Luther King's passive resistance approach was either not working or working too slowly, and was supplanted by Black Power militancy. The riots after Martin Luther King's assassination escalated the white flight and most urban Jewish communities are now either black or Hispanic communities.LIBERTY HEIGHTS follows coming of age stories of two brothers from a middle class Jewish community in Baltimore. One brother becomes involved with a rich girl and her boyfriend from a wealthy upper class WASP neighborhood; his brother with a black girl being bused into his high school. She is the daughter of a well-to-do upper middle class black family. At that time the people in these communities knew almost nothing about the people in the neighboring communities, with racial stereotypes and rumor substituting for truth and facts. A sign on a community swimming pool reads No Jews, Dogs or Negroes allowed. The movie also follows the boys' father, who runs a burlesque theater as a front to launder the money he makes from the illegal numbers racket in the parts of Baltimore not controlled by Italian Mafia or by black criminals.Barry Levinson masterly wrote and directed LIBERTY HEIGHTS, using this Baltimore family's stories to show us a part of urban America and its race relations that no longer exist.The sound track is full of wonderful songs from the era that are now classics.

The  moments of racism and whatnot were just too  far and few between. Another trouble with the  film is the fact that the multiple plot lines  caused some problems with the flow of the  film.

This seems to be doubly the case when that upbringing has taken place in a heavily ethnic family and neighborhood filled with intergenerational and societal conflicts.  With Barry Levinson, of course, the scene is the Jewish section of Baltimore known as Liberty Heights at a time &#150; 1954 - in which the old standards of segregation and unquestioning devotion to tradition were beginning to crumble in the face of an up-and-coming generation of freethinking youths.  The youths in this case are two brothers in their late teens, sons of a local burlesque theater proprietor and local numbers runner, who face down anti-Semitism as they flirt with interracial and cross-cultural dating.`Liberty Heights' is a perfectly decent little film, well acted, relaxed in its pacing and admirably lacking in obvious melodramatics.  Its portrayal of interracial tensions  - paradoxically, between two equally despised and mistreated minorities, Jews and blacks &#150; is surprisingly restrained and subtle.   Thanks, too, to understated performances from a first-rate cast (Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe Mantegna) and an air of casual believability in its screenplay, the film does relatively well by itself.  Most admirably of all, the movie does not overstate the villainous qualities of its `bad guys,' and by so doing, manages to see the subtle shadings of virtues and faults that lie in each of us. However, all this niceness comes with a price.  With so little in the way of genuine conflict, the film seems to wander a bit aimlessly for much of its running time.  For one thing, the relationship between the father and his two sons remains strangely sketchy, possibly because they share very little screen time together.   We never sense the reality of the bond that so obviously exists between them, so much so, that, when the father is finally caught and sent off to prison, we have no way to fairly register the feelings or reactions of the boys.  Not only does this incident seem to leave no mark on their emotions, it provides no sense of how it colors their perceptions of their father's moral character.The unfortunate fact is that this material has simply been played out now by the umpteen similar films which have come before it.  What are needed at this late date are some fresh insights to help breathe some new life into the formula.  These Levinson, as both writer and director, simply fails to provide.  We watch with cool detachment as the scenes play themselves out in predictable and uninspiring fashion.  Perhaps it is time for filmmakers as a whole to move on past thinking that their every childhood memory should serve as fodder for the audience's edification.   Unfortunately, for `Liberty Heights,' fine as it is at times, we discover we much prefer our own childhood experiences to theirs.  "}]
