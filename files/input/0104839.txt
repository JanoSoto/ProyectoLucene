Even as a hardcore Connery fan I avoided the film simply based on a handful of reviews I had read in the media at the time.Fast forward nearly ten years and the mixed reviews here on imdb reinforced my apathy towards the film. It wasn't until I borrowed a copy through a local library that I finally watched the movie just now, and I fail to see why it's supposedly not up to par. I thought it was a fine film in most respects the storytelling was good, the dialogue was snappy, the cinematography was wonderful, and it had a positive message. It's not an action movie, but I never felt bored at all...if anything, it was a refreshing change of pace and scenery, and Sean Connery continues to astound me with his versatility. His acting was superb, which is not really a big suprise, but he seemed more into this role than some others I've seen him in. Even the wig and ponytail looked real!Like a lot of other people, I found Lorraine Bracco's character quite annoying, almost insufferable at certain points, but that's the whole point her character is supposed to be like that, and the truth is that if she didn't come across as so irritating then that would have been failed acting skills on her part. I think she did a great job at being annoying, which is what she was supposed to do. I imagine that if you took some ivy league lab rat scholar and dumped them right in the middle of a situation and place that's totally foreign to them, you'd probably get a reaction like the one she portrayed. I found the two leads had a good chemistry, and the constant tension and conflict between them was very convincing and helped to propel the story along.All in all an enjoyable film, but some of the other aspects could have and should have been expanded. I felt that they spent too much time searching the trees for the plant they needed, and the whole conflict with the developers was thrown in at too late a juncture. These aren't major failings however, so I'd recommend the film to anyone looking for something a bit different, and it's a must for any Connery fan. Don't wait ten years to see it simply because some critics didn't think it was a masterpiece. Screw the critics!

The eccentric scientist Robert Campbell (Connery) who has found a cure for cancer out in the jungle, is not able to reproduce its exact composition. Biologist Rae Crane (Bracco) biologist has dropped in from academia to be his judge and jury and decide on Campbell's continued funding.The film pays a fair amount of attention to scientific detail (such as running baselines and using experimental controls) interspersing it throughout with lively and shrewd exchanges between Campbell and Crane. To that they add mildly sarcastic observations on field work and fund-raising committees. Whilst this scientific sub-story line runs along, we are shown glimpses of life in a sympathetic tribe for which Campbell has become a sort of sugar daddy. Ethics and personal choice confront both scientists as they struggle with the decision to reserve the last bit of serum either for the good of humanity or the life of one of the tribe's children.McTiernan has weaved all these elements excellently and Connery and Bracco play their roles so convincingly that you could be excused for thinking they may have scientific backgrounds in real life.The film is a feast for educated people - which is probably the reason why many of the critics have missed the fine points and proceeded to rattle off some vitriolic commentary more aimed, in my view, at self-aggrandizement than constructive film criticism. One even complained that Medicine Man didn't quite match up to Die Hard. Now there is a proper comparison for you.

That Bracco got through to the tribe's medicine man when Connery had failed was the contrast between the two approaches the white man could make toward the natives. Bracco's negotiating skills and stubborn common sense contrasted nicely with Connery's unintentionally patronizing approach. Who COULD have been cast who would have been more convincing as the civilized woman going native. Lauren Hutton, maybe. The solution to the mystery of compound 37 was a genuine surprise, even though it was partially revealed on two separate occasions.

In befriending the natives and studying the `Tribal Witch Doctor' (Angelo Barra Moreira), he has accidentally discovered the cure for cancer from a flower extract that grows wild in the rainforest.  He is assisted by Dr. Rae Crane (Lorraine Bracco) in trying unsuccessfully to duplicate the formula, before the commercial loggers come in and destroy his hope for a cure.  Dr. Crane comes to the jungle with the motive of pulling the research grant for the project, as Dr. Campbell has been uncooperative with the bureaucracy. Coming to the jungle with guilt and regret from a prior research trip, `Morcara,' his work becomes his life, escaping reality and trying to compensate for the devastation he experienced.  It was interesting to see how the natives accepted him, brought him into their `circle.'  They accepted his medical knowledge and entwined it with their superstitions and natural remedies.  He became so protective of the tribe, respecting their way of life, and customs that they come to trust him and call him the `Medicine Man.' The movie was released on February 7, 1992 and while the work of Director John McTierman, was different than his other movies Hunt for Red October or the Predator,  Sean Connery played out the part well.  The sound of his voice is always welcomed.  I've seen him in stronger parts, but I cannot see anyone taking his place beside Lorraine Bracco.  The knowledge and wisdom of the experienced is passed to the inexperienced. I liked the environmental message that the director sent.  The scenery was great from the tree top scenes to the trip through the jungle and the waterfalls.  Anytime elements of nature can be used to heal the human body or someone can survive in the jungle by utilizing the natural habitat is a wonderful thing.  It shows us everything actually depends on the natural creation of the earth from which it came.

The film highlights issues of natural destruction that were very important during the 90s, particularly the destruction of rain forest and pervasiveness of Western civilisation upon small cultural societies. Its a film thats been poorly received, partially I think, because it deviates from the Hollywood film that audiences expect to get from director John McTierman whose other titles include 'Predator'. The character Dr. Rae Crane (Lorraine Bracco) has not been received well by many audiences, some reviewers labeling her as a poor love interest/heroine. This is too simplistic and reliant on the stock standard structure of a Hollywood film. 'Medicine Man' is a film much more grounded in reality than it is in the aesthetically touched up films of Hollywood starting a lustful actress whose function is to provide a predictable love affair that undercuts the films plot. Cinematically 'Medicine Man' appears more like a documentary than a Hollywood film. It has no expensive sets, or perfected hair and makeup. The half naked natives are real, not America's ideal female body; the Amazon jungle in many shots is not the perfect 'sunset' look at nature that an idealistic 'Hollywood' film might produce; Dr Ray Crane is a character with a coarse voice, she's intelligent, wears unattractive glasses and loose fit clothing. At the lack of conforming to an 'ideal' and predictable character, Dr Ray Crane is more real. All of these help this film to diverge away from your typical 'Hollywood' structure and allow this film to present something real and informative about natural destruction which we might otherwise turn a blind eye towards. If your looking for something informative and moving that's grounded in reality, I highly recommend this film. However, if you can't stand a film without the fast paced action, or the predictable fall in love at the end plot, be wary.

While Sean can correctly portray any job, Lorraine's acting was really spot on to convey both the academic and cultural differences of her role.

Action auteur John McTiernan tries his hand at a different genre, and for the most part, actually succeeds very well. He crafts an easy-going, stylish and witty film that while mainly dialogue driven is engrossing and well-paced right up to the films conclusion. However, it is the conclusion that is the main weakness of the film. The film sets everything up plot wise very well, and I was expecting something more spectacular regarding the films climax. There was a great opportunity to have a much greater set piece as the audience never really sees that actual impact of the series of events that take place in the film's final act play out &#x96; too much is implied by jumping events forward to the aftermath of a major event. Filmed on location in the Mexican jungle (doubling for the Amazon) McTiernan gets some very good performances from the Native American actors. While Lorraine Bracco in my view came in for too much criticism. Initially she does not seem to have a grip on her character and the performance comes off as forced &#x96; and is dangerously close to wooden. However, as the film goes along her character evolves well and gradually becomes more likable and warm. What probably complicates matters is she is up against the trenchant screen presence that is Sean Connery. Yet again he absolutely dominates the film by sheer charisma, and his flawed Robert Campbell character is truly engaging and carries the picture &#x96; but also makes Bracco's performance appear second rate for a large chunk of the film. However, Bracco getting a Razzie nomination was just an excuse for a bit of celebrity bashing. Director McTiernan is ably supported by excellent technical contributions, most notable Don McAlpine's excellent photography, but particularly Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding score, which elevates the material and creates a terrific atmosphere. It is particularly effective in heightening the moments of tension towards the film's climax.Overall, an enjoyable film that is marred only by Bracco's uneven performance at the start of the film, and a rushed in unsatisfying climax.

Sean Connery and Lorraine Bracco and the rest of the native cast shot this film in some of the tropical areas of Mexico near Vera Cruz which substituted nicely for the Amazon rain forest. No more back lot jungles for films any longer.Sean Connery is a research scientist working among some of the primitives in the Amazon and Lorraine Bracco is sent from the foundation that funds Connery to check his progress. It seems as though Dr. Connery has mislaid a cure for cancer he just might have discovered. He got the cure from the advice of the tribe medicine man who pointed him in the direction of a flowering plant that only grows at the tree tops in the rain forest. He made a batch of serum that worked and hasn't been able to duplicate it, nor find another source of these plants.Connery's search for the elusive plant reminded me of a scene in the John Ford classic The Horse Soldiers. William Holden played a doctor who prescribed a poultice of tree moss to cure an infection that was given him by a Cheyenne medicine man. John Wayne thinks Holden's been smoking some other Indian product, but as even us high school biology students are aware, penicillin is a byproduct of mold from tree moss. Holden didn't doubt its results and neither does Connery in his work.The problem is that the Brazilian government is looking to bulldoze the area to create a road. And Bracco's foundation is threatening to pull the plug on the funding.Connery is fine as the iconoclastic doctor who with his beard and long hair, when he doesn't have it in a ponytail, Sean looks like Buffalo Bill. According to the Citadel Film Series book on the Films Of Sean Connery, he and Bracco did not have an easy time of it, but they got through the film.Although it would really help to have more a knowledge of biology and chemistry when Connery and Bracco get technical, Medicine Man is still a film that can be enjoyed by the lay person.

True, MEDICINE MAN is not great, but it gets away with being mildly entertaining.  The film follows the exploits of Dr. Rae Crane (Lorraine Bracco) as she descends into the rain forests of Brazil.  Her job is to assist and evaluate the mysterious Dr. Campbell (Sean Connery) whose backing is close to being pulled.  Everything is fairly lighthearted, until Campbell reveals that he has discovered the cure for cancer.  The main tension is that he cannot reproduce it - something that the film spends the majority of the running time dealing with.  Eventually, there is a crisis, a climax, etc...The sad thing is that this should have been a better film.  Everything is there John McTiernan, an under-rated director, who is at home with filming the jungle (see PREDATOR).  Sean Connery gives one of his more spirited performances here, he seems to be having fun with the role. The rich photography, by Donald McAlpine, makes MEDICINE MAN a wonderful film to look at.  The story is decent, using semi-factual accounts as the basis for the narrative.  All this plus one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores of the 90's...the music simply shimmers and sways like a soft wind through the treetops.  So...Why doesn't this film work?  One problem is that you simply do not care about any of the characters (excepting Connery).  Lorraine Bracco's character is abrasive, but the failure of her role is due more to the writing than the acting.  Sean Connery's role is very well developed; the screenwriters seem to have focused more on the haunted and quirky Robert Campbell, and nobody else.  Yes, Bracco's character is annoying and grating and irritating and whines too much, etc., but if it were a stronger character we could have forgiven her for these qualities. Also, the narrative arc of the story seems a bit clipped near the end, what with that whole twenty-four hours to find the cure for cancer thing.  The action during the finale seems forced and is not really reinforced during the film proper.  We see smoke off in the distance once or twice, but there is very little urgency in these scenes.

The plot is fairly thin (could've been fleshed out *much* more) and the acting is, for the most part, nothing short of horrid. Lorraine Bracco (who I usually like) is so annoying in her role that every time she's on screen I cringe. The drama was overdramatized, the melodrama was all saccharine and cheeze...the subplots/background story was all so transparently contrived that it made me more nauseous than rapt. On the other hand, though I don't know how realistic it was, the glimpses there were into the aboriginal life of the rainforests was very interesting...enough so to keep me attentive. And Sean Connery was as good as he could have been considering how one-dimensional his character was. Overall, this film had potential but fell past flat and into cinema limbo. But Connery saved it from being a total disaster, and I could watch it the whole way through without checking my watch every five minutes to see how much time had elapsed. In other words, it could have been *much* worse. Watchable but hardly invigorating, this film was in all respects average. 5/10.

The film's main premise, that of a scientist (played by Connery) who's discovered the cure for cancer but cannot reproduce his findings, is intriguing but not given much thought. As a whole, Medicine Man is generally schizophrenic in its approach and execution.  Adding Lorraine Bracco into the mix as a doctor from New York feels like a bid to attract female viewers (though I think Connery himself would probably bring in more women than Bracco could).  She's also easily the movie's worst aspect, delivering her most annoying performance to date, which says quite a bit.The story concerns Connery and Bracco trying to reproduce the cure, which apparently was derived from a flower that exists high atop the jungle's trees, which leads to a lot of fun tree swinging.  Such moments are entirely inconsequential, but undeniably cool to watch.  I especially enjoyed the scene where Connery has to save a sobbing Bracco from falling into a lake.Those parts essentially make up the adventure portion of the picture.  Yes, I know, Indiana Jones this ain't.  McTiernan, whose specialty is in pumped-up action sequences, probably realized the premise doesn't give him the opportunity to display much in the way of energetic gun battles, so he puts as much oomph into the tree swinging as possible (ironically, his best picture, Predator, was a jungle set thriller). To make up for the action/tension deficiency, McTiernan plays a lot of the material for laughs.  The amount of attempted humor surprised me.  The amount that actually resulted in laughs surprised me less so, I chuckled a few times, but generally found the attempts at comedy unsuccessful.  That Bracco is basically the film's comic relief (and love interest/sidekick/tough heroine) speaks volumes about how desperate the filmmakers must have been.The ultimate message, that man's destructive nature (or at least civilized man) is an inevitability of life, is unsubtle and worse yet, unaffecting.  So is the movie's big surprise twist involving the cure, which should have been obvious to me but still somehow caught me slightly off guard.But aside from Bracco, nothing in Medicine Man is ever outstandingly bad, just middling.  Connery fans will surely give it a look (if they haven't already done so) and McTiernan fans should check it out to see how the acclaimed director fares outside of his typical action fare.  Lovely score from Jerry Goldsmith, who has yet to truly disappoint me.

One's first inclination would be to dismiss it as a goody two-shoes, 'save the rain forests' diatribe, and on top of that, it makes us sit through yet another on-screen relationship where the man and woman can't stand each other at first and then fall in love. I almost gave up on it about ten minutes in, after listening to Lorraine Bracco bitch about everything in sight with a nails-on-chalkboard New York accent. But both those characterizations turn out to be unfair and false. The movie actually accepts the inevitability of at least part of the rain forest being paved over; its complaint is much smaller and tightly defined- it's saying, at least wait till we've replicated the cancer serum that Sean Connery's Dr. Campbell discovered and then lost. And Campbell and Dr. Crane (Bracco) never fall in love. I don't think they ever even kiss. It's difficult to say exactly what kind of relationship they end up having, except that it's a lot of fun to watch. Ultimately, it's easy to say with certainty what is so right about 'Medicine Man.' It's Sean Connery's performance, and it is magnificent. While this is not the best movie he's ever been in (no question there), I really believe this might be his greatest acting job. It is subtle, nuanced, powerful, humorous... he has a way with the dialogue that makes it utterly believable, and his portrayal of Campell is also a very physical one. When he gets angry, his anger is incredibly palpable, both to be heard and seen. There is not a false note in it. He even raises the level of the requisite tit-for-tat back-and-forth arguments with Bracco's Crane to something more genuine and meaningful. There is a grace in his physical movements that is very natural, even in the brief fight scene toward the end. Everything he does seems real. And Lorraine Bracco, as it turns out, compliments his performance with a fine one of her own. The script gives her many opportunities to flesh out Dr. Crane's character (or, as Campbell calls her, 'Dr. Bronx'), and she does so with a lot of high spirits and enthusiasm. One of the best scenes has her bouncing off the walls, figuratively speaking, from a local concoction very high in caffeine. The location camera-work is another wonderful part of 'Medicine Man.' This may be the closest any 2-D film has come to seeming three dimensional. When it rains, you almost feel as soaked as the characters on screen. And when Connery and Bracco go gliding on ropes and pulleys over the canopy, looking down at the treetops and miles of forest in the distance, the effect is breathtaking. The ending should be a downer but somehow 'Medicine Man' manages an epilogue to the depressing finale that is hopeful, uplifting and encouraging while not seeming the least bit contrived or manipulative. It is the last wonder in an excellent movie full of them.

The film was directed by John McTiernan and whether or not Dr. Robert Campbell's(Sean Connery) initial research was focused on cancer is never revealed.  The plot suggests that it was a miracle when he happened upon the healing powers of a flower in the heart of the Amazon Jungle.A dilemma arises when he attempts to reproduce the elixir in a laboratory setting and fails.  He must send for a researcher who has an exceptional knowledge of botany.  However, he doesn't receive any of the three men he requested.  Instead Dr. Rae Craine(Lorraine Bracco) is assigned under him. Her arrival causes conflict, and resentment is felt by both researchers.The theme of the film shifts its focus to the growing admiration they begin to feel for each other.  When this shift occurs, there is an obvious prelude to every Hollywood love story.  The monotonous ` I can't stand you' to ` You're the love of my life' brings down the film.They continue their research while the forest around them is demolished. Construction is progressing forward, bringing a modern road to an uncivilized jungle.  Its course cuts through the village which is the only location where the flower grows.Their window of opportunity diminishes each time they test a batch of serum and fail.  The urgency intensifies by the existence of only one vile of pure solution left.  However, this too is jeopardized when a boy in the village develops lumps in his throat.  The question becomes should they allow him to die for the greater good of humanity or use the last vile to save him from death.  Ultimately, Dr. Craine administers the medication to him which leaves them with nothing but notes to aid them in their research.  The situation is heightened by the approaching bulldozers and road crew.The plot has a weak backdrop and the film seems somewhat dissected between the quest for a cure and a bland love story.  Segments lack direction and certain details are sketchy.  Yet, the end reveals an intriguing twist. Still, the movie continues on for another five minutes when it should have ended after its resolution.

Brocco learnt self control, quiet and reasoned analysis of situations and an appreciation for the spectrum of matters and relationships demanded of them and the aboriginals of the area.It was a relaxed, message carrying, and thoughtful movie deserving about a 7 or 8 out of 10. Both Connery and Brocco deserve accolades. They each played their part well and their efforts were much appreciated.In the past, Mr Leonard Maltin has shown a preparedness to re-evaluate a movie where warranted. Perhaps those who feel that the scoring of this movie was lower than expected, or that Brocco's performance deserves a much more favourable review, an email to Mr Maltin might just bring about that amended view.

A foundation sends down a youngish, award-winning scientist, played by Lorraine Bracco, to monitor his behavior, find out what's up, and decide whether or not to cut off his funding. Lots of barbed exchanges here between the old curmudgeon and the independent new woman. Some comedy too as he slips her a psychedelic that cures headaches. As it develops, Connery, with Bracco's help, finds the source of a cure for lymphoma in the top terrace of the rainforest. Alas, before he can harvest enough of the stuff to explore the possibility of its being synthesized, some big industrial operation plows a road through the forest and destroys the trees in which the stuff grows. Bittersweet ending. Humankind is hoist by its own petard by what some ecologists call a progress trap. As compensation the old fox and the young feminist become friends. It's a bad trade.Between 1960 and 1990 one fifth of the world's rainforest was lost. In Brazil, where this film is supposedly set, the Amazon rainforest between 1991 (when the film was shot) and the year 2000 has lost between 415 and 587 square kilometers, an area about twice the size of Portugal. The tragedy is not that the forest is gone. Who cares about wood? It's the consequences, many of them falling into the category of unknown unknowns that counts. WOULD a biochemist of Sean Connery's persistence and quirkiness have found a way of combating lymphoma (or anything else)? We're not going to find out now. Among the known known consequences, the deforestation has eliminated entire species of plants and animals at an alarming rate, including one primate. (Humans are primates too.) The little message behind the story is, of course, fashionable and politically correct, which for some people makes it wrong. Lorraine Bracco, with her bulky figure and oddly handsome features, seems a likable woman. You can tell because in all of her performances she seems to be playing herself. She can be loud and stubborn but one never senses genuine contempt behind her shouting. I wouldn't mind having an argument with her. It might be amusing. Sean Connery plays a role that must by now be familiar to him, almost shopworn, and he does his schtick well. There appears to be a lot of half-naked Guaranis running around, acting as translators and comic relief, but this is really a two-person picture.At one point Bracco is tripping on this native stuff and having a hell of a good time. She babbles on about marketing it for adults, putting sugar in it, and calling it by some pronounceable name. I wish that she'd have accomplished that because unless we recognize a progress trap when we see one coming, we may need that psychedelic elixir.

This is another of those statement films which indeed has a message....for all the good it does. Man is going to continue raping the land for money as surely as he will continue to wage war for the same. I found the scene with Lorraine Bracco getting high on the local caffeine elixir, and then down with the favorite homebrew to be very funny.

I was lulled into the theater by the false pretense that Sean Connery could do no wrong film-wise... was I ever wrong.I can't honestly give a full review of 'Medicine Man' because it was so dreadfully boring that my ex-girlfriend and I left about 45 minutes into it. From what I can remember is that there was Sean Connery in a jungle setting looking for the cure to cancer. Woohoo... How exciting. I can only hope that the movie improved from there because at that point I was almost comatose. If it came on HBO or something I might try to give it another try, but I won't hold my breath,.

Why did he ignore the Scientific Method and not create a baseline? What elite, highly-educated field researcher, headed for the Amazon, would pack pajamas? How is it that an elite, educated field researcher and environmentalist, knowingly headed for the Amazon, would be annoyed by the inconveniences (bugs, rain) and afraid of snakes? Reference is made to the syringe. Is there only one, which is re-used? Where did they get the hundreds of feet of rope, pulleys and harnesses - and later a hammock and cooking equipment - when each of them was carrying only one small backpack? Would there not be traces of the serum left in both the vial and syringe; i.e., the serum was not used up? How is it that a RAIN FOREST is so flammable?

Why? Well because this is the film script I wrote when I was at college! I sent it to loads of movie directors such as Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron and Paul McCartney and got NO response. I certainly DIDN'T send it to John McTierman, so I've no idea how he got his hands on it.They've also changed some of the characters and the location, but the storyline is still there. I say storyline, but what storyline is there in this film? There's NO storyline, that's where it is. Basically in the original version a man called Bob Campbell (that's right Connery, I wrote that role that you butchered) gets a job as a futuristic dustman after being involved in a fishing accident. After being rehabilitated and trained by the SAS he gets to drive the worlds most advanced bin lorry, and it even talks! But some Russian secret agents steal it and Bob and this black guy from MI5 who's got special powers have to track them down before the next days shift! It also happens at Christmas time, so there's more rubbish than usual making it more exciting.I don't know what the biggest insult, the fact that my name's not mentioned in the credits or the fact that the story was such a bad conversion from script to film. I kept hoping that Bradley (that was the name of the Bin Lorry) would turn up and say something like`Attention Bob Campbell. Mrs Howlett from number 17 is trying to throw away garden waste in her bin bag. She must be punished.'But that would seem so out of place since they moved the whole film to South America and replaced &#145;Eye Fly Spy Guy' with Lorraine Bracco. I can almost understand the change of direction with this film involving the rain forest and how the human race is slowly destroying this planet, but other than &#145;Men at Work' there haven't been any films starring bin men, particularly none about a talking lorry that can fly.So from my point of view, knowing what the film could have been like I think &#145;Medicine Man' is something of a let down. Clearly everyone involved worked hard, but I just kept thinking what a waste of time the whole film was.Oh and by the way, if somebody emails you and &#145;claims' to have a way of making a Koala go cold turkey then I suggest you ignore it, unless you want to get covered in blue vomit.

There were a few reasons I did not like this movie. For one I watched it In the morning-after very little sleep-NOT a good time to watch a movie like this! Also-the plot. It was very confusing and just very movieish if that makes sense. Action oriented with many typical type movie scenes thrown in. I can't give specifics as it is difficult for me to remember it scene by scene which I guess means I didn't like it.I'm also not a major Sean Connery fan but this movie just seemed longer then it was and a bit off the top at times. It didn't make a strong impression on me and it seemed like typical Connory. Definitely not the worst but would not see it again. "}]
