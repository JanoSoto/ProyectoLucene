[{"Title":"Fred Dekkar's Other Cult Classic","Date":"16 March 2004","Score":"42 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Prospective Monster Squad viewers may recognize the name Fred Dekkar, the director of another 80s cult classic, a zombie horror called Night of the Creeps. Monster Squad follows in that tradition as the horror-comedy about a gang of young kids who save their town from Dracula and his goons. In my opinion, Monster Squad is a much more enjoyable movie than Night of the Creeps. The Monster Squad refers to a tree house club of five kids who are self-proclaimed horror fanatics. Little did they know that their enthusiasm in the genre would suddenly come in handy as their town in suddenly invaded by Dracula and a few other memorable horror villains in their classic form. Drac is terrorizing the town, trying to locate a powerful amulet which has the potential for serious disaster. When no one else believes the kids, or when no one else is powerful enough to stop them using traditional crime fighting methods (arresting the Wolfman didn't seem to work out), the Monster Squad (with the help of Scary German Guy and Frankenstein) takes things upon themselves to save the day. This movie was great because, although the monsters may appear somewhat corny (not forgetting that it is technically a family horror film), it still has a heap of great qualities. The kids are actually all pretty cool (especially Rudy, even though his wears his pants so tight, you can see what side he tucks on). Great music, great cast (Andre Gower, Robby Kiger, Ryan Lambert, Stephen Macht, and Jon Gries), and great fun!Fans of obscure 80s movies are sure to add to the cult following. You won't be disappointed. It is loads of fun. Bona Fortuna!

It deserves the special edition treatment.I've seen this film so many times, first as a youth when it was released, and it never gets boring.It's campy without being stupid, and tongue-in-cheek antics abound.

A group of young boys unearth an evil secret within the diary of vampire hunter, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Dutch, not German, but forgivable).  Dracula has returned, and has re-animated Frankenstein's monster, and brought along a innocent, but tortured werewolf, the frightening, Creature of the Black Lagoon-esque Gill-Man, and a 2000-year old Mummy.The SFX are spectacular, and the make-up and costuming are very well-made. This movie closely follows the the myths and folklore of popular monsters (only wooden stakes and garlic are effective on vampires; even dynamite cannot stop the silver-prone werewolf; etc.)The acting is somewhat lacking, but this is a kid's Saturday night drive-in type movie.  Only Duncan Regehr (syndicated TV's Zorro) as the truly and unrelentingly evil Dracula is worth mentioning.  However, Tom Noonan as the kindly and gentle Frankenstein's monster is a great departure from the malevolence of his counterparts.Highly recommended.

When Sean, the leader of the Monster Squad, is given a book that can illuminate why the monsters are reappearing, he has no choice but to seek the man's help. The book, it turns out, is in German. Not only does the scary man speak the language, and kindly help them get through the important passages in the book; it also happens that he knows what monsters are.You might need to explain to your kids what the numbers tattooed on the scary mans forearm are.

Produced by Peter Hyams and Rob Cohen, and with a script by Fred Dekker and Shane Black, the Monster Squad had a lot of creative talent behind it, so why did it fall into a limbo like the one featured in the movie? Set in small-town America, a bunch of young kids form a monster-movie fan club in their eccentric treehouse. But when REAL classic monsters show up (that would be the Wolfman, Gillman, the Mummy, Frankenstein's monster, AND Dracula) they begin to look deeper into their origin with the help of Van Helsing's diary.I'd love to explain the film further, but the execs at TriStar Pictures ordered 15 minutes to be cut from the film, which results in a huge loss of coherence in the first act, thus creating many plot holes. Just where did the monsters come from? If Dracula's cargo was randomly jettisoned over small-town America, how come the amulet he's looking for just-so-happens to be there? Some scenes in this film are almost over before they begin. It's very frustrating. The credits begin to roll at the 77-minute mark too, so whoever thought that the film was overlong was clearly a fool.For years, the Monster Squad was available only on a long out-of-print VHS release. Naturally, as was the logic at the time, this was a pan-and-scan version which butchered the film's brilliant anamorphic composition.Fred Dekker killed his career beyond redemption with RoboCop 3, but The Monster Squad and Night of the Creeps will forever stand as two low-budget horror homages from a decade that endorsed risk-taking.

I was past the kids and tweens age and what I remember most about this is the harsh reaction it got from critics. I remember parent's groups screaming about how bad and violent Monster Squad was for their kids. But ya know what... this was a good monster film for kids and teens. I'm surprised they haven't made a sequel. They really should have.I've got to call on my fellow movie junkies from the late 60's and 70's when we were toddlers and children watching TV for this one. Remember when they showed us the old Universal Films late at night -- Dracula, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein and the gang? Remember the 'all day' Thanksgiving Godzilla marathons? And remember these shows as a kid Creature Feature, Chiller, The CBS Friday Night Late Movie, Dr. Shock, Joe Bob Briggs, Elvira and many more across the USA? This film is for OUR kids - make no mistake. The other kids, well, they missed out.Monster Squad was done in the best possible light - it didn't talk down to kids and put them in control when the adults wouldn't believe them that Monsters were taking over their town. Plus there were other monster references beyond the scary ones - the real ones that occurred in History. The children, kids and tweens cast in this film were adorable and cast right. You had your smart alec leader type kid obsessed with monsters, your typical fat kid, your really adorable little girl/sister type who wants to be a part of everything her older brothers and his friends did and adorable/shy little boy. Shane Black, who was a popular screenwriter of the 80's with Lethal Weapon and the like, knew what he was doing with this one, and Fred Dekker, the director, directed his young staff well. This wasn't silly - it was a believable kids world where kids were the heroes and the parents were thankful they were. The parent's weren't dumb either, that was refreshing.The monsters were as you remember them the uptight Dracula and his faithful Brides, the misunderstood Frankenstein, The weird Mummy, the conscientious Wolfman. The special effects at that time were exceptionally good (and probably too scary for children under 7 at the time - but I rank this movie for kids 8+ not children 7 or under.I mean, I saw 10 year olds at the remake of The Texas Chain Saw Masacre a few years ago, so now, 'Monster Squad' would be lukewarm to them.) If I had an 8 year old, we'd be watching this together just like I watched Universal's Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, The Invisible Man with my parents and/or siblings. (Granted I did see other horror films alone, but you can't beat them all!) Heck, these films are in my DNA, I know it would be in my child's.This is quite the underrated 'kids' monster movie.

Within the amulet the forces of evil rage and whomsoever wields it can set them loose. Dracula seeks the help of other mythical creatures the Wolfman, the Mummy, the 'creature from the Black Lagoon', and the indomitable Frankenstein monster.

The real 'star' of the film is make-up and special effects wizard Stan Winston (creator of 'The Terminator', 'Predator', and 'Aliens' creatures, to name a few). With an amazing eye for detail he has been able to capture the monster's legendary traits, and individual demeanor to perfection. They're really wonderful creations (not too corny or too scary) that hark back to their previous incarnations with a touch of the modern. Though the film borrows heavily from others such as 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins', and its intended kid audience may be too young for some scenes, it's still a fun movie with the works.QUOTE We just went through some major s*** and where's the big limbo thing.

What saves this film is that it has good casting, good laughs, and excellent creature effects. (The Creature from the Black Lagoon looks awesome for 1987 standards). All the monsters are basically 'more' realistic versions of all the Universal classics, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Wolf Man, The Mummy, and as mentioned Creature from the Black Lagoon.

Universal had nothing to do with the making of this movie but the monsters seen here are undeniably based on those classic films.Wonderful direction from cult favorite Fred Dekker. The script, by Dekker and Shane Black, is smart and funny. For a so-called kids' movie, it's not watered down or cloying.

Wolf Man, Mummy, Gill Man, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula in man-bat form all look amazing. Jon Gries is great as the Larry Talbotesque human who fears the full moon's effects on him. Duncan Regehr's Dracula is menacingly evil and a spectacular villain. Tom Noonan makes for a sympathetic and endearing Frankenstein's monster. The Monster Squad itself is comprised of some impressive kid actors who surprisingly never went on to bigger things. The inclusion of concentration camp survivor Scary German Guy to the film was a nice touch. Something like that would seem cliché today but back then it was novel and refreshing. He's played brilliantly by Leonardo Cimino.This is a fantastic movie made at possibly the last time you could have made something like this and have it work. If it were made today it would be an overblown mess with emphasis on CGI. It's an homage to the great films of the past while adding some fun contemporary touches that still hold up today.

Their love of old fashioned Horror ran so deep that they started a club in their tree house, calling themselves, The Monster Squad. Everything is just child's play until one day, real monsters start showing up in their small New England town, and it's up to the Monster Squad to stop them. When this film came out, not many people took notice of it, it wasn't until Lionsgate bought the rights and re-issued it. that Monster Squad became somewhat of a cult classic. This film is pure 80s, a time when kids were actually played by kids. Today, we're so afraid of traumatizing these kids, that we have 16-19 year old teens playing much younger kids. Back in the 80s, when the part called for a kid, they found a kid, and being that this was the first film for the vast majority of them, the amount of energy and excitement they brought to the film really kept it going, in what is otherwise a ridiculous story. The actors were the age of the characters they were playing and when they cursed or talked about adult themes, I found it hilarious, it was so much better because it was real. The story isn't anything to write home about, just a bunch of cheesy lines and bad special effects, and I'm sure you could figure out what's going to happen from the description on the box, but to me the best part of the film is the realism given by the cast in a movie that was anything but real. The dynamic between brother and sister, the kids who actually did something imaginative, instead of just playing video games all day. It isn't until you see a film like this that you realize just how much family films have changed. This would be a great film for kids to watch, but if it came out today, the kids would be played by college students and it would get an R rating for some of the language. In the 80s, this would have been the textbook definition of a family film, by today's standard's, it's rating has been upgraded to PG-13 and it's filed under Horror. The more things change, the more they stay the same, what was unacceptable in the 60s and family friendly in the 80s, is now not suitable for children under 13, a sign of the paranoia of the times we live in.

The Goonies changed that in 1985 and there was never a film quite as good, that was until 1987 when horror cult legend Fred Dekker (Night of the Creeps) brought us a movie that was more adult, yet knew that wasn't going to stop every kid seeing it without too much effort.Enter one of the most awesome films of my childhood; The Monster Squad! With all the classic prosthetic effects, comedy and blood and guts explosions synonymous with 1980's horror legends, Fred Dekker told a tale of an unlikely band of guardians standing against the forces of darkness; a bunch of kids barely into junior high (as far as I can tell, being English).The son of a cop, Sean, and his tree-house gang are faced with Dracula, the Mummy, Wolfman, Manphibian and others when an ancient artifact is lost in their suburban town. Dracula needs it in order to complete his quest for dominance over humanity, but when Sean's baby sister accidentally brings home Frankenstein's Monster (played brilliantly by rent-a-psycho Tom Noonan of Manhunter, Robocop 2 etc) and he turns out to be friendly, this turns the tide in their favour.Just when you think this is some silly kids fantasy played out for nobody but the kids however, the action amps up a few notches and we're not spared from some seriously enjoyable monster carnage the way it's supposed to happen.With some hilarious one-liners (WOLFMAN'S GOT NARDS?), it escalates to the point where you really miss kids being able to use bad language in films. Let's not beat around the bush here. Film and television is ignorant to the fact that most insults and swearwords today are invented by kids before they enter the mainstream.Monster Squad recognised that and with all of this good fun happening all around, and with kids kicking serious ass with crossbows, shotguns and even sticks of dynamite for crying' out loud, this movie is still today some of the best fun you can have with a kids movie.It's so politically incorrect that it couldn't be more accurate! Monster Squad doesn't try to be anything more than fun, fun, fun and whereas it's exactly that, call me sentimental, but it's also very touching at times and I can't recommend it enough.Please come back, Fred Dekker, the world really needs you!

Brent Chalem will always be remembered as Horace, R.I.P.The tone of the film is odd but that's what makes it so memorable. I can see why at the time of its release why audiences may have been put off by the movie. After all, plenty of swearing, strong content, but the leads are children. Who exactly was the target audience? The dialogue is snazzy, the comedy well-staged and yet these characters feel very real to us. That's really where the audience is; anyone who is willing to embrace the characters really. And no worry, all along there is some excellent carnage. After all, if nothing else, the film answers the age old question if a silver bullet really is the only way to kill a werewolf.Loads of fun and a classic that's for damned sure.

While it's a long way from being a good film, it has some well-done scenes and obviously it was well-liked by many of the previous user commentators. Stan Winston's work in the creature designs was very effective, but the special effects were not up to the same level. Even many of the original movies featuring these characters were not exactly noteworthy for outstanding acting and writing, but they entertained audiences with some memorable screen characters and some of them here, particularly the Wolfman and Gillman, came out quite well.

One of the films that he highly recommended was The Monster Squad, the weird thing is being a huge movie buff, I had never heard of this movie. But it looked really cool from the clips he was showing, so I decided to just buy the movie and I am glad I did. One of the things I am a huge fan of is the old Universal horror movies, like Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, etc. But during the 80's it was more about making new horror icons like Jason and Freddy. Being brought back together in a clever updated way, we get to see all the icons together being led by Dracula. It's so odd because I don't know if this was a kid's movie, a family movie or a true horror film, I think the answer is yes. I wonder what kind of effect this movie would have had on me if I saw it as a child vs. an adult, but honestly I had an absolute wonderful time watching it in my 20's, and this is definitely a great film to watch during Halloween.The Monster Squad is a club of pre-teens who idolize classic monsters and monster movies and hold their meetings in a tree clubhouse. Sean is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the Monster Squad get their neighbor who is German to translate the diary. The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise-indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world.The kids are absolutely hilarious! Almost like seeing if The Goonies took on the old monsters, we have a whole different variety of the cliché kids. Plus they have one of the coolest lines in film history with Wolfman's got nards!, that was too priceless. Seeing Frankenstein and the little sister together was both charming and very funny to watch. I love that Frankenstein isn't the typical monster that he's normally made out to be since he is more of a tragic figure and he's a good guy in the film. I think why this film is so great is because of the chemistry between the kids and the rest of the cast. Plus I have to admit that I was a weird kid who absolutely adored horror movies and this just took me back. It could take us all back to a time where monsters were cool, even though I'm pretty sure we wouldn't want to defeat them in a battle, but they were fun to talk about and watch on the big screen. Remember Halloween? When it was about getting dressed up and getting candy and coming home and pigging out and watching a scary movie? The Monster Squad gave me the chance to be a kid again and I adore this movie, totally worth the buy.9/10 "},{"Title":"Exactly why is this movie bad?","Date":"18 July 2007","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I'm not gonna say this movie suck because it's stupid and has bad acting or whatever. Fact is, this movie could have been great. The actors were cute, the monsters looked incredible, and the effects were fine for the time. It's 80s camp, it's monsters, it's kids kicking crotches - all that is awesome.The sole thing that brings this movie down is how choppy and incoherent it is. It seems like there is a story (which actually seems to be a cool story for an 80s kids/monster film as far as I could tell) but only the writers knew it well, and as a result it's edited in a way that if you knew the story and characters it would make sense, but to anybody in the audience it's hard to identify with the characters or feel with them or even follow the story well at all. I very much wanted to like the movie simply due to its 80s charm. I love that kind of stuff, really I do. But the story is so badly structured you can't enjoy the movie.Characters join the Monster Squad for no reason. Bad guys do things with little or no setup. Characters seem to have knowledge of things happening that they shouldn't have. People have odd motivations and strange reactions to events. All this could have been corrected with good editing, both writing and film editing.The characters were lovable but that was destroyed by the bad film structure. Ruining lovable characters and monsters like those kids is simply a travesty.At the same time, the movie seems incredibly confused as to whether it's for young kids or old kids. Lots of swearing and other big kid things (over 13 please), but lots of characters in elementary and grade school.I love 80s kids adventure movies. This is not a good one. At the end I felt cheated because not only was it a bad movie, but it was a bad movie that definitely could have been totally rad 80s awesome. Nostalgia nothing, even as a kid it's not memorable simply because you couldn't get close to the characters because of the bad way it was edited/written.This is saved from one star because of the potentially cool characters and the 80s-ness of it.

In this film, we have five of Universal's most famous monsters - Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster and (best of all) The Creature From the Black Lagoon, all moulded into a plot that follows a bunch of kids that group themselves into 'The Monster Squad' to battle the classic fiends. Director Fred Dekker is undoubtedly most famous for his cult classic 'Night of the Creeps', and while this follow-up isn't quite as good; it certainly shows the director's talent for making enjoyable lightweight horror films, and this film triumphs because it throws caution to the wind where logic and seriousness is concerned; and plays out solely for a good time. The film opens with a sequence that sees Van Helsing attempting to thwart the evil Dracula, before moving swiftly to the modern day where we are introduced to a bunch of monster-obsessed kids who, after a series of odd occurrences; begin to believe that the movie monsters are about to take over the world.By keeping the film true to all the rules of the classic Universal films, Fred Dekker gives it a sort of credibility over and above what a film of this nature should have; and that is the main reason why the film works so well. Dekker manages to ensure that the film will appeal to two big horror audiences; fans of the classics will appreciate the plot and humour, while young kids are bound to get a kick out of the characters and their witty dialogue. The film is very short, running at just over eighty minutes; and while the plot that we do have is meaty enough considering the type of film; this is one of the few occasions where a lack of padding actually harms the film. Somehow, Dekker manages to gives ample screen time to all the monsters, however; and just as was the case in Universal's attempts to blend their monster flicks together, it is The Wolf Man that gets the best scenes. One major criticism of the film that I'd like to make is that Duncan Regehr is not charismatic enough in the role of Dracula, and the other monsters are all bigger highlights than him. Still, there is only one Bela Lugosi; and the fact that the cast of child actors isn't annoying in the slightest more than makes up for this. Overall, The Monster Squad is a great slice of eighties kitsch and comes highly recommended to the right people!

Fueled by the release of classic Universal horror films of the 30s to television at the time, and the ubiquitous Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine as well as the arrival of the great Aurora Plastics long box monster models....there were monster clubs nationwide. One suspects that director Fred Dekker was influenced by all this horrormania when choosing to helm TMS in 1987.TMS hasn't aged particularly well. A recent viewing after first seeing this in a theater on it's original release reveals a number of problems with the film as a whole. TMS can never seem to decide exactly what it's going for. Horror? Comedy? Adults? Kids? For every silly moment and laugh, there's genuine unpleasantness. Characters are easily disposed of and instantly forgotten, such as the cop who gets blown up by Dracula. One minute he's spouting one liners and the next he's killed in a fairly grim fashion. No other character reacts to this in any fashion. The three vampire mistresses show up in classic Universal style, but are so obviously tacked on to the climax to provide the resident badass kid with a couple of kill shots we forget about them immediately. Only two are shown killed, so what happened to the third? The monsters, lovingly re-imagined by the late makeup genius Stan Winston, are so easily destroyed that we don't really care about them. They're simply there to be killed by a gang of kids, Scooby-Doo style. Only these kids use real weapons instead of their wits. Easier to shoot the Creature (known here as Gillman) and call it a day.TMS appears to have been heavily edited since the extras on the new DVD release show a number of scenes that were cut. The simple plot of TMS could have used some of the deleted scenes to help fill the many, many plot holes in the final version of the film. What remains to be viewed really does play out like a cartoon. Heavily Un-PC in places (mostly some gay slurs hurled by resident mega-jerk actor Jason Hervey) firmly root TMS in the awesome 80s. Two things to look for here though, the startling reveal of Dracula as half-man and half-bat lying on the floor, and the jaw-dropping head lift of the little sister by Dracula, calling the tyke a bitch.The real hero of this monster mash is Eugene. He's little, has a dog named Pete, and no one, except for the US Army pays any attention to his encounters with the monsters. He has a couple of the movie's best lines, including the great creature stole my Twinkie. In any event, TMS is still worth a viewing, decent effects for the time in which it was made and the natural inclination to see this homage to the Universal monsters as a low-budget rip-off of The Goonies. A good Halloween treat for adults who want to share a few thrills with their kids without excess amounts of violence and bloodshed. Despite the flaws, TMS still invokes that shuddery frisson in those who remember the good old days.

Hell the young boys even have a fat kid amongst their ranks and he wears loud brightly coloured shirts too.The plot is hammy as hell but it is suppose to be a homage and twist on the classic B-movie horror genre and of course Universal horror monsters. Putting all the big name supernatural beings together and sticking them in the 80's (present day back then). All the classic monsters including Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Gill-man, the Wolf Man and The Mummy teaming up to try and take over the world with a supernatural amulet, only the kids can stop them. The only way they can be stopped is to open a portal into limbo and kick them through...this whole idea visually looks identical to the portal sequences in the 'Evil Dead' franchise.So the whole thing is really cheesy and silly as it is suppose to be a kids flick, but it is??. There is actually some quite edgy scenes in the film with visible blood and body parts! when Wolf Man gets blown into pieces for example, nothing much hidden. Some scenes are also a bit scary for the younger viewer in my opinion. Again Wolf Man attacking people and transforming in classic 'American Werewolf' style, stakes through various hearts with blood, Dracula trying to actually kill the kids and the makeup doesn't skimp with realism. The monsters all look as they should in classic style but they certainly aren't tame by any means. Wolf Man has a much wilder vicious look which is pretty scary, Gill-man is the best if you ask me, he looks terrific, whilst Frankie is as expected as is The Mummy. Its only Dracula who doesn't really thrill, the casting seems a bit off to me, the guy in the role just doesn't look right, he's too young and 'modern' looking if you get me. There are also Dracula's vampiresses who look as you would expect but they have no purpose in the film, kinda under used idea really, clearly crammed in.Naturally there are plot issues a plenty which don't really matter but they do stick out. Why exactly does Dracula have Frankie in the first place?. Where did Dracula get that big black slick custom hearse?? he's only been in the US about one day! and how did he get a hold of that big mansion? is it his??. The most obvious to me was why exactly Gill-man, The Wolf Man and The Mummy all joined Dracula in the first place, they all just appeared and teamed up. So before hand what exactly did Gill- man do? he just like...lived in the swamp? how did he and The Mummy know Dracula had arrived in the region? I'm guessing it was his supernatural powers. None of the monsters have any real backstory, it all just happens.The silliest of all was in the finale when Van Helsing appears from the portal to drag Dracula through it. But if Helsing was in limbo how did he get out to do that? and wouldn't he wanna try and stay in the real world once getting out?! I'm pretty sure it wasn't easy.Its certainly a strange beast this film, its hardly for kids with the blood, monsters and Dracula going around snapping cops necks, yet it is aimed at kids with the young 'Goonie-esque' line up. The young cast are good but the whole time you can't help but think they really wanted Corey Feldman, Haim and Astin in the main roles. Pretty much cast everyone from 'The Goonies' in this and while you're at it call it Goonies 2. End of the day the film was just an excuse to bring back all the classic B-movie monsters and have them looking top dollar with modern makeup (for the time of course). And it works plain and simple, the plot is daft with many holes but it doesn't really matter, its a flick for ghoulish monster lovers with a touch of Indy adventure for good measure.8/10 "},{"Title":"They did the Monster Mash, it was a Graveyard Smash","Date":"3 May 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Although I have pretty much seen every significant (and insignificant, for that matter) horror movie of the 1980's, I can't quite give a proper reason why The Monster Squad escaped me throughout all these years. Fact is that my first viewing of this widely popular cult semi-classic is at least 20 years overdue and therefore I can't help thinking that my rating and impressions would presumably haven been a lot more enthusiastic if I had seen it at a more tender age. Still, even through the eyes of a skeptical and experienced 30-something genre buff, The Monster Squad nevertheless remains an enjoyable brew of horror, comedy and kids film. First and foremost the film is one giant amiable homage to Universal's classic monster cycle Dracula, Frankenstein (both 1931), The Wolf Man (1941), The Mummy (1932) and the often overlooked Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). If I would have seen this movie when I was a lot younger, it certainly would have sparked my interest to seek out these golden oldies, and that's quite a praiseworthy accomplishment for a modestly produced 80's B-flick. And like Universal Studios themselves already attempted during the 1940's, writers Fred Dekker and Shane Black bring all these legendary horror icons together into one giant mad monster party. The plot is ludicrously simple, but effective and engaging enough. Once per century, evil masterminds have the opportunity to rule the world if &#x96; and only if &#x96; they conquer a magical amulet. Count Dracula has set his mind on this, and therefore he summons his fellow monster mates Mummy, Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster and the Gill Man. Our fate and salvation lies in the small hands of boys who barely even hit puberty! These horror-obsessed and rather geeky social outcasts gather in their tree house (nicely decorated with vintage old posters) and chatter about horror movies until now, in fact, they find themselves actually trapped in one. The Monster Squad is particularly fun to spot all the obvious and less obvious references to genre classics and, of course, to admire the supreme monstrous creations by Stan Winston and his collaborators. Unfortunately, and this is mainly the mature horror fanatic speaking, there are too many soft and semi-childish plot twists (like the whole friendship between the Frankenstein monster and the little sister) as well as some tedious parts. Good, solid direction by Fred Dekker. If you haven't yet, make sure to watch his debut feature Night of the Creeps, which is the total definition of 80's B-movie entertainment!

The tad-bit history on that I've always loved and have been infatuated with horror since I can remember. But, since I was forbidden to watch Rated-R fare, and since 99.997% of real horror was R or worse, I had to latch onto Movie Horror Greats of decades before me. I.E. Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and especially the Wolf-Man.This movie was beyond-below my radar growing up and even into my adulthood (yeah, even at my old age, I'm still wondering when I will feel like an adult.) Sure, I've heard of it, but since I missed it as a kid and heard so little buzz, I never thought of seeing it&#x85;.Until that friend recommended it to me.I'm very sad I did NOT see this as kid. It would've satisfied ALL of my needs adventure, horror, all the monsters I loved and all in one place and best yet these kids were my age when this movie was released. How could I not relate and absolutely fall into the film and create my fantasies of how I would react? I did that with Escape to Witch Mountain and Back to the Future; I would've certainly seen this dozens of times knowing myself.I digress. I cannot change the past and despite my 5/10 star rating, I really didn't have a problem seeing this as an adult.

They're all obviously virgins, especially the fat one.(Before I get hate (e)mail, I would ever have referred to him as fat if the script didn't call him as that multiples of times.)Uh, I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie's about the legend band of cinematic monsters, mostly portrayed in the 1930s/1940s classic Universal films, who are real and face a (mostly boys) club of horror-movie monster fans. Inevitably, they find the way to destroy&#x85;all&#x85;monsters&#x85;when no one takes them seriously.The special effects are surprisingly good for the type of film it is, the acting isn't too bad, some of the comedy is actually pretty amusing and the adventure for the young at heart is intact. Deep? Not really. The Goonies kind of take on horror? Yeah.

It sounds strange, since the movie still works as entertainment as it is but the movie at the same time still feels like a bit of a waste of a fine concept.There was so much more to explore and do with its concept. Here we have a movie that stars all of the classic movie monsters such as Dracula, the Frankenstein creature, a wolfman, a mummy and even the gill man, in a movie aimed toward young teens. But there is actually very little happening in the movie, which is also really due to its script, that just doesn't a very solid or original main plot line in it.Yet it really isn't a boring movie but even though that the movie is fun, it just never gets off the ground as any good or involving enough entertainment. Things remain quite shallow and underdeveloped and I'm talking about both the story and all of the characters that are in it. Even the villains, that are all horror icons of course, remain a bit boring, also because their villainous plot never really becomes clear or threatening enough.It's definitely a good looking and well made movie though. It just suffers from its uninspired script, though the movie still has some strong points as well to its story. One of those things is that nicely puts its emphasis on its kid characters and tells the movie from their perspective. It should make everybody feel young again and remind you of how uncomplicated life was at a pre-teen age. Things were still very black and white and all of your problems seemed to be trivial in today's perspective. All of the kid characters interact very well and realistically with each other, which is something that this movie truly benefits from.Really, despite of all my criticism, I believe that this is still a pretty good movie for young kids, who will probably appreciate and enjoy it all better. Especially young boys, that are also into horror stuff as well.7/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Scooby Doo eat your heart out","Date":"13 June 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I loved this movie as a kid.

Together in their treehouse, they escape the world through their love of all things sci-fi and horror, much to the confusion of their teachers and parents. When fiction becomes fact and Dracula descends on their home-turf with a few buddies in tow, it's up to the kids to save not only themselves, but the future of mankind as well.Co-written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) much of the film's energy comes from the hilarious dialog given to the child actors, who come across as not only likable, but believable as well. In a genre where child actors are usually maligned, it's quite a relief to find a cast so young that can carry a movie so well. It's surprising, then that none of the children went on to have budding careers (save for Jason Hervey who went on to TV's The Wonder Years).Dekker, who serves as both director and co-writer, gives his film a fun, feel-good vibe, that makes the film more family friendly than the average genre film, but not at the expense of the audience's enjoyment. No matter what age you are, you'll find yourself laughing and cheering along with The Monster Squad, which is precisely how the film found its audience on video in the years since its release. Seeking a good old monster mash with heart? Look no further.

Standing in their way, however, are a gang of plucky kids who possess the knowledge to defeat the evil count once and for all.It may be pure popcorn cinema, and have it's fair share of plot-holes, but with Stan Winston providing the excellent make-up effects, Richard Edlund overseeing the visual effects, and obvious genre fan Fred Dekker calling the shots from the director's chair, this is highly watchable stuff. And if you remember the 80s, it's also a bit of a laugh thanks to loads of very dated and cringe-worthy fashion, haircuts and dodgy pop tunes (the Monster Squad rap at the end is abysmal!).

One night, oscillating vibrations brought to life three legendary monsters...Dracula! The Werewolf...and Frankenstein! I'm sure you get the drift. Despite the fact that Walt didn't bring Frankenstein back to life (he brought Frankenstein's Monster back), the series was very similar to Fred Dekker's feature film, although Fred added The Mummy. Made around the same time as The Goonies and Explorers, this monster flick for young teenage boys is an absolute winner. The scene of The Mummy unwrapping as he is dragged behind a car is priceless, as is the film's respectful treatment of the legendary Universal monsters. The pace is tight, Dekker's action sequences show evidence of real skill, and the cinematography, by Bradford May, carries photographic echoes of the old black and white flicks that these monsters originally appeared in.

But I haven't seen it since the late 80's. So my first thought with any movie from the 80's is, does it still hold up? And this one, in my mind, does without a doubt. It has all the cheesy goodness one would want, with a low body count, that one would expect of a PG-13 movie in the 80's.Being a kid who loved horror movies, this situation was a dream for me. I lived out in the country so the closest neighbor with kids my age was two miles down the road. Needless to say, I didn't have any friends nearby that I could have formed a Monster Squad with. The parts that I remembered after all these years were when Phoebe first met Frankenstein's monster, and when she was playing dress up with him. I imagine those struck such a chord with me because as a young girl I would have loved to have done this.Some of the things I noticed that I am sure I didn't even stop to think about for a second as a kid were at the beginning when a female vampire is sucking a possum dry, and I think there was an armadillo running around in the scene. I just really thought these were strange animals to choose. And when I was looking over the credits, Charly Morgan comes up as Vampire Bride with possum.The fake bats hanging from the ceiling and bouncing around were adorable. And Ryan Lambert, who played Rudy, reminded me a lot of Corey Feldman, who as a kid, I also thought was adorable.Now for the things that I wouldn't have even thought about when I was younger, but really stuck out to me as an adult, were how many times at the beginning they used the derogatory slur for gay men. Also Horace was called Fat Kid, even by his friends. In this day and age with bullying being such a hot topic, if you watch this with your kids, you just keep it in mind when you watch it.A few other things were an open flame by Phoebe's bed. Her mom had put it there telling her as long as it burned, the monsters would stay away. Open flame next to the bed, not the best idea, but hey, we survived that and a lot worse in the 80's. Also, the black police officer, and I think he was the only black person in the movie, got killed by TNT. It made me think about Scream 2 where Jada Pickett Smith remarks about the black characters always getting killed.In the 80's I remember divorce being a big topic. Sean, the leader of the Monster Squad, had parents who were going to marriage therapy and were on the verge of divorce. But after slaying monsters together (His dad's a police officer, and the mom sees the monsters towards the end) it looks like they will be one big happy family.

Monster Squad is one of the best movie to watch on Halloween! A scary, good-time!","Date":"31 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" This movie mash is a graveyard smash! Though this horror comedy was not a success on its initial release in 1987, it subsequently developed an even-larger cult following, every year. Directed by Fred Dekker, and written by Shane Black. The movie tells the story of a group of kids call the Monster Squad, whom job is it, to stop a series of monsters, leaded by Count Dracula (Duncan Regehr), from taking over the world. Without spoiling the movie, too much; while it might seem, a bit silly and over-the top. It's honestly, a lot of fun to watch. I love, every minute of it! Yes, the extreme violence & gore, profanity, and dirty sex appeal might turn off, some parents from allowing their kids to watch this PG-13 film. However, as a kid of the early 1990s, I found this movie to be, awesome. Even, now as a mature adult, I find this movie, still very much, appealing; and wouldn't mind, allowing my children to see it, if they wanted to. After all, it's a lot tamer, than what children, see in movies, nowadays. Despite, being a little dated, there is a lot to like. I love how great the Universal Monsters The Mummy (Michael MacKay), The Gill-man (Tom Woodruff Jr.), The Wolf Man (Carl Thibault), and The Frankenstein's Monster (Tom Noonan), looked. However, some of the other, special effects, needed some work, such as the bats. Still, great work from Stan Winston and his team of special effects artists. Another thing, I like is, how well-acted, all the creatures were. Tom Noonan as Frankenstein's Monster & Duncan Regehr as Count Dracula are the best stand-outs. I love, their chemistry when face with the youngest member of the Monster Squad. It was iconic. Another great scene is the famous, Wolf Man got nards, scene. Even if, you never saw this film. You have, at least, heard of that scene! It's everywhere on the internet as a meme. If you have, saw this movie, you might agree with me, that for the most part, the film has pretty good pacing. There wasn't many boring or slow spots in Monster Squad. The movie is full of gut-blasting action, that you can't take, your eyes away from. Not only does, this movie treat your eyes, it also feeds your ears, some of the best 1980's kid movies music, you'll ever, listen to. This film indeed has an awesome soundtrack. Rock until you drop by Michael Sembello was truly rocking! Still, there are some things that I didn't like, about the film. Examples are, how respective clichéd all the main characters, are. Sean (Andree Gower), Patrick (Robby Kiger), Horace AKA Fat Kid, (Brent Chalem), Rudy (Ryan Lambert), Eugene (Michael Faustino) & Phoebe (Ashley Bank) don't have much, complexity. In my opinion, Eugene being the worst of the group. He literally does nearly nothing to help, further the plot. I really didn't like, the character, at all. I also dislike, the child's acting. He was so annoying. The other child actors weren't that bad, but they sure, wasn't great. It was just mediocre, at best. Another thing, worth criticizing, is the nonsensical plot. The movie doesn't do, a good job, explains, how the monsters got, in the present day. No part of this movie made any sense. The amulet, the diary, the search for a virgin, and even, the large amounts of weapons & explosives, they able to use. All these things, needed more exposition. It was so badly delivered. The worst, had to be Sean figuring out, that the monsters are alive, by finding out that Mr. Alucard is indeed Count. Dracula. It gave me, horrible 1990's Troll 2 flashbacks. Then, there, was the moments in the film, where this film, went to really dark, deep implications at times. A good example of this, is how the Scary German Guy (Leonardo Cimino), know so much about monsters. It was very jarring, compare to the rest of light-hearted and relax parts of the film. The movie also went, a little overboard on the mean-spirited jokes. I get the film, was going for uber-realistic on how, children, at the time, acted, but gees, some of the things, these kids, say, are, very offensive insults. Overall This 1980's cheesy high camp, horror comedy is a trick or treat flick, worth-checking out! Highly Entertaining. Do recommended.

This time, it is a group of kids who love monsters who have to do battle with the likes of Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon (or Gill Man in this case). The setup is very enticing and it delivers on its 80's goodness for a good ol' fashioned time.Good The movie has a very fun tone to it all throughout. It is very 80's and is a lot like Goonies and E.T., but for the horror geek in all of us. Seeing these different iconic monsters together was great and the kids brought together great energy throughout the movie despite being stereotypes. Fred Dekker loves his monsters and the scenarios shows that love for the old Universal monsters. The climax is a lot of fun with plenty of action and laughs. Tom Noonan is good as Frankenstein's Monster and the effects and suits from Stan Winston look good. The movie moves at a lightning speed as well with its brash nature making me smile a lot.Bad The direction can be off at times as there are clear editing and time continuity errors throughout the movie that stick out. The editing can sometimes disrupt the flow of a scene. The acting overall is not that great with a lot of over acting happening everywhere although for the kind of movie it is I'll give it a pass. One thing I never really got into was Dracula himself. The actor playing him never fully felt like Dracula and much more like someone's dad who REALLY got into it on Halloween. I felt another actor would have made his role bigger and more intimidating.Overall, it is a cult classic for a reason as it is a horror geek's dream as a kid to go into battle with these iconic monsters. It is cheesy and dated at times, but it has fun with its premise and delivers on it.

The whole outlook on homosexuality has shifted completely (for the better). There is also some potty language which was okay for PG movies in the 1980s but probably would not slide today.Overall, though, this is a really good movie that brings the Universal monsters to the next generation. I am not exactly sure how they were able to use the characters without risking copyright infringement, but well done.

The Monster Squad was a live action horror movie that came out in the summer of 1987. The movie is based upon this group of middle school aged boys that are obsessed with monsters. Dracula is alive and plans on taking over the world and seeking help from the other monsters. And whose there to stop them, a group of kids that are considered as loser to their classmates that are here to uncover what the monsters plans are to attack the forces of evil. Will Sean and the rest of the group save the world? This is a good film for families to watch. Instead of there being a bunch of gory killing scenes like there is in the Halloween movies or A Nightmare on Elm Street and other slasher movies from the 1980s; there is more comedy and a little crude behavior in the movie. Since I was five at the time and the movie was PG-13 my mom thought it was OK for me to watch it. At first I didn't like the movie since every time Dracula came on I would freak out a bit like most young children would, then as I got older and watched it the more I love the movie and the way they delivered the plot and the characters really well. You're probably thinking if there aren't characters like Freddy Kruger or Michael Myers like in the other movies in the decade. There was Dracula, Frankenstein, a werewolf, a mummy, and the Gill man. The costuming for the monsters made them look a little scary, but now looking at them today they look a little bit corny at least with Frankenstein, Dracula, and Gill Man looked a little too made up and fake. The only one that looked more real was the mummy from the wrapping to the skull head and the way that he walked too. I think that it's a good horror movie to start out with because it's not like most horror movies that there is a lot or death scenes and that there isn't a big male or female adult lead like most other movie. The heroes the children that are barely in middle school. The plot is easy to follow. The special effect were good for the time, since the movie was made in 1987 it was probably the best special effects that they had 26 years ago, compared to today if people see it, it would be more corny and more friendly for a young audience. It also follows some of the popular stories that the main monster character. I think that there is also a message in the movie as well. When Frankenstein came into the movie Dracula had him locked up in room and telling him what to do. Then when he met that kids at first they were scared of him but in the end they all liked him. What Frankenstein wanted was someone to be his friend instead of having people fear him like they do in other stories, since he was made by a human.

I didn't see it until some years later, but can't help wondering why this little film gets dumped on so much? Sure, most 1980s kids were fans of slasher-type horror, but the notion of some being into the monsters from the classic era is not a bad idea. Having them save the day in the end is a nice touch as well, though granted, this movie isn't going to be a contender for one of th best such ever made.The story is more or less a reworking of the Universal monster rallies of the 1940s with the kids in the Monster Sqaud opposing the creatures; it does not take itself too seriously in doing so, and I feel it has just the right mix of humor and some creepy moments as well. The Gill-Man and mummy don't get a lot to do unfortunately, but Tom Noonan's portrayal of a friendly Frankenstein monster is a plus. Dracula and the Wolfman are suitable ferocious(although the wolf man unwillingly so).I think fans of 1980s cinema would like this little movie better than what many of them seem to I would add.All in all, a nice family film/monster picture with some nice revisions of several classic film monsters.

All and all it's an imaginative and witty little children's horror film, from the director of Night Of The Creeps a hilariously bad 80's throwback to 50's drive in zombie/alien movies.

Not that those films can't be fun, but back in the day they were treated with much more class and dignity. By the late 80s the genre had been exhausted by endless sequels, imitations, and direct to video movies. But not all were exercises in greed and/or vanity, and this little gem from the writer of the equally enjoyable 'House' is a great example of both that and a tribute to the classics.Pros Awesome special, make-up, and visual effects that have aged well. Good performances from a likable cast. Tongue is planted firmly in cheek. Great production design, especially for such a small low budget film. Quick pacing. Made with an obvious affection for the classics and the genre as a whole. A decent score. A really cute, if not totally original idea.Cons A concept not quite taken to it's full potential. At 76 minutes it's really too short for things to fully develop. Borrows a bit too much from 'The Goonies.' One big plot hole, which is that early on in the movie Dracula is able to survive in sunlight.Final thoughts Though not quite as good as it might sound, this nearly forgotten slice of 80s horror is far from a waste of time.

Do you think that Night of the Living Dead (1968) or The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) became cult classics overnight? (Actually, they did.) The Monster Squad, like nearly all cult movies, was dismissed by most critics and audiences upon its 1987 release, but fan demand has given this film a wondrous afterlife on home video, culminating in a glorious DVD with enough special features to make any fan proud.The movie, a sort of cross-pollination between four distinct sources - Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Stand by Me, and all the classic Universal Pictures monster movies - that combines these elements of such distant cult favorites and rolls them into its own creative universe. I loved watching this movie when I was a kid. The Monster Squad was one of my favorite movies from my childhood as a young kid growing up in the '80s. It scared me, and delighted me with its mix of adventure, horror and comedy, compliments of co-screenwriter/director Fred Dekker and co-screenwriter Shane Black.The Monster Squad is purely nostalgia. What happens here, is that Count Dracula is in town, with a few days to kill. Apparently he wants to bring about the end of the world and he needs an ancient amulet to help him do it. So he calls upon the classic movie monsters (who have each been given a present-day update by special effects wizard Stan Winston) - Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the Gillman - for further support in his devious plans.To the rescue - who are you gonna call? - the Monster Squad, Dekker's teenage monster-busters, if you will. Led by courageous young Sean (Andre Gower), and his friends and fellow monster hunters Patrick (Robby Kiger), Fat Kid Horace (Brent Chalem), Eugene (Michael Faustino) and Rudy (Ryan Lambert), they sharpen their stakes, round up silver bullets (using mom's fine dinner utensils), and make garlic necklaces and prepare for an epic showdown in town square. Sean also happens to be in possession of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing's diary, which holds the key to defeating Dracula, and he enlists help from the Scary German Guy (Leonard Cimino) who lives down the street to translate it so that they can save the world.OK, so The Monster Squad is fairly cheesy, with many faithful nods to the monster movies of yesteryear and updating that material for a brain-dead '80s audience. Those not accustomed to the in-joke humor and references will probably look at this movie as cheesy '80s nostalgia. It is indeed nostalgia, but it's good nostalgia from an era that's still fresh, especially if you're still a kid at heart and look at this movie with a kind of gosh-wow, wide-eyed childhood innocence.And of course, there are a lot of hokey performances (Tom Noonan's Frankenstein stands out here) and one-liners (that attempt to make the movie look cool and sometimes fail). You can dismiss that, if you wish. But if you can get past those very few short-comings, then The Monster Squad is one of the best experiences you'll never forget from your childhood.10/10 "}{"Title":"Coolest Movie Ever!!!","Date":"29 September 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I was so excited when I found this movie on DVD!

Although, things get a little bit more hairy when those monsters they love turn out to be real. Sooner then they know, they are fighting of the likes of The Mummy, Gillman, Wolfman and the ultimate bad guy, Dracula.Monster Squad was a film that I had on an old VHS tape recorded off the television. The quality was crappy, the sound was iffy and I loved every minute of it. Sometime over the course of 10 years the tape was lost and my childhood classic was lost forever, until the day it hit DVD. It's more then a decade later and I'm happy to say that this goonies for horror flick still holds up to it's cult classic name.Written by the director himself and Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black, Squad showcases some great dialogue. Most of it is camp and corny one liners spoken by this kids to the monsters and all of it adds to that 80's kid adventure feel. I still laugh at such lines as Wolfman has nards and See ya later, bandage breath. You can't really take the film seriously, especially when the main character randomly gets Van Helsings diary and some guy named. Dr. Aulcard. wants it (for those who don't know, that's Dracula backwards).What Van Helsing (with Jackman and Beckinsale) failed to do in this decade, Monster Squad did 20 years ago. They brought back the universal monsters and made them fun. Vam Helsing failed horribly with pathetic CGI. Which goes to show that the old school costume and make-up will always be better then CGI. To prevent trademark infringement, the creators altered the appearances of all the monsters, but only slightly so that they would still be recognized.Monster Squad does ride the coat tails of The Goonies, which was released two years prior, but what sets this film apart is that it has no real big stars, it's not a landmark film by any means and it has a small following. Just like every other film that was made decades ago, if you watch it for the first time in today's times, you won't get that same feeling. That feeling that many had watching this film when they were kids. Watching it now you'll lean more towards the negatives of the film; it's bogus plot, it's coincidences, it's short running time and fast pace style, and the fact that it's not as big as it could be.The special effects, mainly the transformation of the wolfman, hold true to this day. Which says big things about this film because it didn't have the biggest budget. From Dracula transforming into a bat, to of course the wolfman transforming into the hairy beast. The scenes that scared me as a kid still hold up to this day and those scenes all involve special effects. Wolfman transforming in the phone booth and his limbs returning to form after being blown up. Gillman from the sewer, Dracula as a half bat half man.Monster Squad has everything from the young kids (the main kid, the bad-ass, the fat one, the innocent one, young sister) to memorable bad guys and even a scary German guy. The climax of the film is the highlight, with great action, effects, comedy, horror, and suspense. It's every kids nightmare; having monsters in their closet, but it's this film that helps kids to get over that. This film gives them a chance to be one of the members of the Monster Squad and kick some monster ass. The ending gave hope to a sequel, but after 20 years nothing happened. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake though, because nothing can really tarnish this cult classic. It will always remain a classic to me.

Of course their family don't believe them until they see things for themselves. It a fun short adventure that's perfect for young teenagers who haven't see these type of older B-movie flicks. A good rental for Holloween along with Monster House. You don't see too many horror comedies with kids anymore. Instead we get movies like Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks or Scary Movie.

To be sure, I'm not so sure THE MONSTER SQUAD should have been in the family film section, since it's got a bit of course language & the monsters maybe to scary for younger kids, as well as a few situations that happen in the film involving the monsters chasing the kids around, apart from that though, THE MONSTER SQUAD is a really fun movie that all horror fans should see. The story revolves around Count Dracula who seeks a magical amulet that can give him untold powers & allow the dark forces to rule the world, aiding him in his quest for finding the amulet is THE MUMMY, THE WOLFMAN, THE GILL MAN & FRANKENSTEIN himself whom soon stumbles upon a trio of kids called the Monster Squad who are the only ones who know what's going on & knows how to stop them, teaming up with them, Frankenstein decides to help the kids destroy all the bad guys. Thankfully unlike most films I saw & liked when I was younger but was later disappointed by when I saw them many years later, THE MONSTER SQUAD still stands out as being very fun & funny! with excellent monster make-up, fine direction, great acting & a decent amount of suspense. A great film that sadly is hard to find & all but forgotten with the exception of the most dedicated genre fans, which is a shame because MONSTER SQUAD is so much better than for what passes as movie entertainment these days.

First off, I am someone you might want to trust with a review of this film because in 1987, I was about the same age as the kids were when this movie was shot (not to mention the fact that I was also in the age group that this film was geared to, as well). With that said, what teenager grows up in America anymore without being exposed to monsters in various forms? And what better film to watch as a kid (or with your kids) than a film where a bunch of kids fight with legendary monsters such as Dracula, Wolf-man, and Frankenstein's Monster? I mean, aren't there times when you want to kick someone in the 'nards just like when Fat-Kid land a perfect kick square in the Wolf-man's nether-region? Or at times, don't you feel like just opening a hole in limbo so you can be rid of evil just like Pheobe did? I know a slight drawback is that the special effects seem a little crude when compared with today's big budgeted CGI-filled schlock (but actually for the '80s they were some of the best effects I ever saw), but the one reason above all that this is and always will be one of the best movies ever made is that good overcomes evil in the end, even if a bunch of kids have to take charge!

A group of outcast kids get together and form a Monster Squad, where they gather in a treehouse, talk about monsters, and generally get up to no good. So when Dracula shows up in town with a host of supernatural nasties including Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man, they are of course the ones who are best suited to battling these forces of evil and sending them back to where they belong.This is one of those movies that was made about kids, for kids, but which isn't really suitable for kids. It's basically a bunch of little kids running around swearing and making jokes about farting (not that there's anything wrong with that), and it's just begging for cult status. The silliness of the humour offsets the inherent silliness of the storyline, which doesn't even try to make sense. The script is fairly strong, having been co-written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Last Action Hero) who at one point was the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood, and with Stan Winston doing the special effects, where can you go wrong? The Monster Squad doesn't try to be anything other than a whole lotta fun, and it succeeds in that. It's short, sweet and ultimately entertaining -- it'll appeal to the twelve-year-old monster hunter in all of us.

A time when Dr. Abraham Van Helsing and a small band of freedom fighters conspired to rid the world of Vampires and Monsters and to save mankind from the eternal forces of evil... They blew it.' The Monster Squad consist of Sean Crenshaw (Andre Gower), Patrick (Robby Kiger), Horace (Brent Chalem), Eugene (Micheal Faustino), Rudy (Ryan Lambert) & Pete the dog, together they are, well actually I'm not sure other than kids who like monsters. During a cargo flight the co-pilot (Daryl Anderson) decides to investigate a noise in the hold & discovers Count Dracula (Duncan Regehr) whom he jettisons' out of the bay doors along with a large crate marked Frankenstein. Dracula brings Frankenstein's creature (Tom Noonan) back to life & together with the Mummy (Micheal Reid MacKay), the Gillman (Tom Woodruff Jr.) & a Werewolf (Carl Thibault) intends to find & use an ancient amulet which will let creatures of the night rule the world, or something like that. It appears the only people who can stop Dracula & his gang of monsters is Sean & The Monster Squad as his mum Emily Crenshaw (Mary Ellen Trainor) has just given him a book she brought which appears to be Van Helsing's (Jack Gwillim) dairy, a diary which reveals how to destroy the amulet & all things evil in general. The fate of the entire world hangs in the balance & rests in the capable hands of The Monster Squad!Co-written & directed by Fred Dekker I liked The Monster Squad but it also disappointed somewhat. The jokey script by Dekker & Shane Black lets the wonderful premise down, badly at times. While any true horror fan will rejoice & get a kick out of the updated monsters & fun homages if you take this novelty idea away The Monster Squad is a very poor film. At times it feels like the Monsters are there for background decoration only with the Mummy & the Gillman being almost totally ignored & unused until the Mummy gets an awful death scene where his bandage is unravelled like some terrible visual gag out of a Scooby-Doo episode. The Gillman is even worse as he gets almost no screen time before he is simply just shot dead by the most annoying member of The Monster Squad. The Wolfman gets a little bit more screen time but not much with Count Dracula & Frankenstein featuring the most which is a shame because out of the monsters these were my least favourite. The special effects make up on the monsters by Stan Winston are excellent especially the Mummy & Gillman which makes it even worse that they are totally ignored for most of the film. There are various plot holes in The Monster Squad like how did Dracula know Sean had the diary among others? There isn't much of a story when it comes down to it either, I was disappointed that the filmmakers didn't use the monsters more & have a bit more imagination in updating them for modern audiences, impressive special effects apart. On a positive note The Monster Squad still remains terrific entertainment & great fun, it moves along at a nice pace & it never becomes boring or dull especially since it only lasts for 80 odd minutes. The effects on the monsters are great as I've said but the optical effects are poor such as the vortex or Count Dracula changing into a bat. There is no blood or gore either apart from when the Wolfman is blown up & Count Dracula is impaled on a spike. Technically The Monster Squad is good with nice production values throughout & the opening credits sequence set in Transylvania 100 years ago looking particularly handsome with Count Dracula's flaming torch lit castle complete with revolting villagers... Overall I liked The Monster Squad, it's a fun homage to classic film monsters but I just can't help thinking that more could have been done with them & the idea. Good but not brilliant, still definitely worth a watch for anyone interested in monsters & horror though.

These days, not so much, but the dialogue still crackles, as this is one of the first movies from King-of-One-Liners, Shane Black.  Check out his filmography. Some of the best testosterone-driven lines you've been quoting for years probably came from this man's warped brain.  Gotta love it.Good casting, too, but too bad about the directing.

"},{"Title":"A wonderfully witty and dynamic tongue-in-cheek delight","Date":"7 August 2007","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" The evil Dracula (a suavely sinister Duncan Regehr) and his band of equally pernicious monsters -- Frankenstein's monster (a very engaging Tom Noonan), the Wolfman, the Gillman and the Mummy -- need to gain possession of an ancient powerful amulet so they can rule the world. It's up to a gaggle of misfit horror movie buff teenage boys -- likable leader Sean Crenshaw (Andre Gower), bumbling fat kid Horace (the hilarious Brent Chalem), nervous Patrick (Robby Kriger), spunky little squirt Eugene (Michael Faustino), and token cool dude Randy (Ryan Lambert) -- to stop the foul fiends before it's too late. Ably directed by Fred Dekker (who also gave us the terrific Night of the Creeps), with a really clever and inspired script by Dekker and Shane Black, a constant unflagging pace, excellent make-up f/x by the ever-reliable Stan Winston, beautifully sparkling and polished cinematography by Bruce Houghton, a rousing, majestic orchestral score by Bradford May, funky 80's slang (favorite words include wuss, jerkoid, and the immortal nards), some mild gore (the Wolfman gets blown in half in an especially grisly scene), and nifty 80's period touches (there's a Miami Vice dialogue reference and keep your eyes peeled for the Robotech t-shirt), this sweetly affectionate tongue-in-cheek homage to vintage golden oldie creature features has plenty of charm and energy to spare. What truly makes this film such a treat is the positively infectious sense of pure go-for-it good-natured fun that permeates every last loving frame. The kid leads all give highly appealing performances; they receive bang-up support from Stephen Macht as Sean's harried cop father Del, Mary Ellen Trainer as Sean's long-suffering mother Emily, Ashley Bank as Sean's adorable little sister Phoebe, Stan Shaw as Del's sarcastic partner Detective Sapir, Leonardo Cimino as the friendly Scary German Guy, and Jason Harvey as mean bully E.J. A total blast!

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film still holds up well and probably means more to me know since it's easier to spot all the references to the older horror movies. I think the film works so well for the same reasons that Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein works and that's because the monsters are shown respect and the comedy never really insults them. The kid actors are a lot of fun and the monsters are really, really great. I also like that we really get an all-star group here with the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Mummy, the Gil Man and various vampire women. The film is a lot of fun but I was somewhat shocked to see and remember how vulgar and violent the film is.

In any case, this is a solidly-crafted, fast-paced and witty spoof of the old Universal monster mashes with Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, The Wolf Man, The Mummy and The Gill Man all taking part. Duncan Regehr scores best as a nasty Dracula, but Jack Gwillim is a welcome presence in the prologue and finale as his eternal nemesis Abraham Van Helsing. Though essentially a kiddie film with a group of hardened horror addicts/misfits as its main protagonists, it doesn't shy away from gruesome and dangerous situations &#150; the partner to the cop (father to the leader of the Squad) is blown up by Dracula; the Werewolf is himself made to explode in mid-air (a short-term demise, since he recomposes himself only to be shot down by the proverbial silver bullet); Dracula kidnaps and vampirizes three female students, etc. Predictably, the Frankenstein Monster is shown to be of a benign nature after all &#150; he eventually befriends the kids and almost dispatches Dracula himself! Amusingly enough, it was also quite refreshing to hear the boys swearing profusely and saying the word virgin a lot &#150; without actually knowing what it means! Though I feel that GREMLINS (1984) is still the touchstone for this sort of kiddie horror comedy, THE MONSTER SQUAD lags not too far behind it was actually nice to learn that this was no childhood fluke, and that the film still holds up well after all these years. By the way, I followed it with Dekker's previous effort &#150; NIGHT OF THE CREEPS (1986).

A monster-obsessed group of yapping juveniles ends up tangling with Dracula, the Mummy, the Wolf Man, the Gill Man, and Frankenstein's Monster, who have all come to modern-day suburbia in search of a powerful amulet. Affectionate, perhaps, but unexceptional. Has gained an appreciative audience via cable TV, but not many crowds turned out for this in the theaters (nostalgia being out-of-favor in 1987). The movie's weakest link--the rather tacky-looking monsters--is the linchpin of the whole production and, unless you're in need of a Goonies retread, the kids are not much of a draw. The anachronisms in Shane Black and Fred Dekker's script may hook curious baby-boomers...for about a minute. Dekker also directed, shabbily. * from **** "},{"Title":"lame Goonies rip","Date":"29 December 2000","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  A group of young boys, along with some girls (inadvertantly) later, go up against famous horror movie villians that have invaded their neighborhood.  Dracula wants a special book, Frankenstein is his lacky, and other monsters are inexplicably along for the ride.  Way too many echoes of The Goonies abound in this; harrowing adventure, kids swearing, a Sloth like dim-witted creature that speaks slang slowly, and even the token chubby youngster who's uncreatively referred to as fat kid.  But though they stole all that, I enjoyed this here and there and wasn't totally disappointed.  The kids are likable (Gower is a good lead), the swears are cleverly incorporated in the dialogue and the monster make up is above average for a kiddie adventure flick.  This exceeds Goonies in content on many levels, as with the PG-13 rating they were able to juice up the violence, which may be too much at some points for younger folk.  The swearing isn't limited to the kids, as the adults chime in, too, on many occasions.  The most unacceptable one is the moment where Dracula calls a 5-year-old girl a bitch, which was entirely over the line.  Overall, this really isn't worth your time, unless you somehow get into it as much as some of these other IMDBers.

Now I wouldn't say I was a harsh critic, but this movie really reeked. The eigthies was a confusing era, and this movie was a fart of the eighties era of movies. It lingered around for a while and didn't smell too good. The whole idea of kids fighting monsters, is a idea out of some stupid saturday morning cartoon. What kind of an actor would play a fish man. And even the idea of a fish man is staggering. So if you are thinking of watching Monster Squad, think it over, and consider the year of 1987, and the crap that came out of the 80's. "}]
