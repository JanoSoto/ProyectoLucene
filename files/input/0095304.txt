While this film suffers its share of problems, (such as a few holes in the plot, a little shoddy acting here and there) it makes me laugh as few other movies have.  O'Toole's drunken wisdom and fights with his drunken, ghost-talking mother are great. Steve Guttenberg does fine, Daryl Hannah is okay.  The Irish country side is lovelyand haunting (incidentally, the movie was filmed in a castle in Limerick,Ireland, where Frank McCourt, author of Angela's Ashes grew up); the set ofthe castle itself is the stuff that fairy tales are made of. The effort that the staff makes to haunt the cynical guests is great, in particular the Lady Godiva/Broggan Banshee fiasco.While the whole spouse-swapping aspect of the movie is a little hazy, Beverly D'Angelo and Liam Neeson are grand.  The entire plot is somewhat goofy, as are some of the transitions to get from Point A to Point B, but it is the humor that keeps it alive.  It received terrible reviews, but it's absolutely worth a viewing if you're ever in the mood for something a little absurd that will make you chuckle.

Peter Plunkett (Peter O'Toole), and his gang of merry Irishmen are facing foreclosure on their grand castle resort. The old fashioned castle needs a clever advertising gimmick to entice visitors. After talking with his looney, but sincere old mother who always claims that she talks to his dead father and the rest of the poor spirits looming around the dark castle, Plunkett decides that the castle ought to be haunted. And so, the guests are invited to stay among the spirits of the Plunkett family. Of course, Plunkett doesn't believe in the existence of ghosts, especially when he hasn't seen any for himself, despite his mother's attempts to convince him that they're everywhere. No, Plunkett's plan involves a few crappy props and some cheap scare tactics to thrill their small group of American guests.But Plunkett and the gang (nor their furious guests) would ever have imagined real ghosts showing up. And this is where the movie really starts to get funny because everyone, after their various confrontations with the undead and all the strange things that start to happen in the castle, start to become so neurotic as they try to figure out what's going on.The movie is a romantic comedy, of course, though it could've worked simply as a story of the funny occurences in the haunted castle as Plunkett and his frantic guests scurry about trying to deal with the situation any way that they can. Guttenberg is Jack, a sorry guy who's married to a real dull lady (Beverly D'Angelo) that really can't stand to know him, especially when he drags her out to some stupid castle. Jack actually starts to fall in love with one of the ghosts, a Plunkett ancestry named Mary (Daryl Hannah), a sickley looking young girl who died by the knife of her husband (Liam Neesom). The ghosts keep playing out the murder over and over again, and Jack, accidently intervening in one of the reenactments, somehow frees Mary from the murder. And so, now she's in love with Jack. But how does a ghost and a human end up together (and they have to end up together...after all it's a Hollywood love story)? Well, that's why you have to watch the movie.Everyone in the movie is fantastic because, though some may start out to be quite annoying (such as the self-declared professional parasychologist or the cynical Sharon (D'Angelo)), they eventually come to be very entertaining as the movie goes along. I especially like the goofy interaction between Meg Tilly as the nympho and Peter Gallagher as the soon-to-be Priest. Peter O'Toole is wonderful. He is also the last to realize what the heck is going on.It's definitely a comedy worth watching.

Being quickly panned by British critics, and then dissed by their American colleagues, leads me to believe that many critics write negative reviews based on the opinions of others. In recent years, many critics seem especially to have hidden agendas, or have an axe to grind, or are pandering to special interest groups, which render their reviews worthless. Often, these critics appear to have never seen the movie they are condemning, or, worst still, are ignoring the cinematography and entertainment value based on their own petty bias. In High Spirits, some critics complained that the plot is thin, flighty and lacks realism?!?! But this is a comedy (and a very good one at that), not a serious theatrical work like as play by Shakespeare or some other artsy-f**tsy piece for the pseudo-intellectual snobs. While not perfect, it is certainly not the complete waste of time that some of these so-called critics claim it to be.The fact is, folks, this movie is very entertaining, a real joy, from the story, to the acting, to the sets, to the special effects, etc., etc. just a pleasure (albeit a guilty one) of movie entertainment. The entire cast give an exuberant, high spirited performance (pun intended) which is sure to tickle your funny bone. Peter O'Toole is hilarious as the penny-less, hereditary keeper of the castle who is about to lose it all. But Liz Smith is a riot, playing Peter's tipsy, widowed mother who still interacts (read has sexual relations) with her dead husband and communicates with other deceased family members. Liz Smith is a thief - she steals just about every scene in which she appears. A horny Steve Guttenberg, an unfaithful Beverly D'Angelo, a rapidly decaying Daryl Hannah and a flatulent Liam Neeson give excellent performances. The pious Peter Gallagher and temptress Jennifer Tilly are terrific in supporting roles as are the remainder of the cast, who are mainly from Dublin's Abbey Theatre, except for Connie Booth (who played the housekeeper Polly Shearman in Fawlty Towers), who is an American.Please ignore the critics on this one, folks, they are way off. This is a very funny movie, with a few semi-scary moments, that I can highly recommend to you. If you want classical drama, watch Hamlet or Otello, but if you want hardy chuckles, watch High Spirits. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.Rating 8/10 stars "},{"Title":"I finally found the title of the folk song early in the film","Date":"2 March 2014","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" After all this time..

I love every eccentric cheap second of it and couldn't ask for anything more, I've actually memorized it!! The story begins with Peter Plunkett (Peter O'Toole) about to have his home/castle/hotel taken away by a family rival named Jim Brogen who wants to open it as a theme park called Irish World in Malibu, CA. Fearing the loss of his home and place of employment he gathers his fellow workers and drunken mom (Liz Smith who I would love to have drink with) to conspire a way to get tourists to come stay at his hotel by masking it as a haunted castle which of course it's not although mum says otherwise. Of the many colorful guests that are staying there is Jack Crawford (Steve Gutenberg) and his wife Sharon (Beverly D'Angelo) who are having extreme issues with their marriage and are coming to Castle Plunkett in an attempt at a second honeymoon which Sharon wants no part of. Among the other guests are a parapsychologist (an expert in ghosts) and his family set to disprove the haunting, a not yet affirmed priest (peter Gallagher) and a sex crazed chick (Jennifer Tilly). Shortly after arriving the guests discover Plunkett's gimmick and prepare to leave but not before they learn that Sharon was sent by her father Jim Brogen to spy on Plunkett thus using her and Jack's trip as an excuse.Jack then gets drunk and stumbles onto a ghostly murder taking place and somehow manages to stop it. Soon after he falls for the murdered specter named Mary Plunkett (Daryl Hannah) and her killer husband Martin Brogen(Liam Neeson)who stabbed her on their wedding night wrongly believing that she loved someone else.Later weird things start happening to the guests and the very real ghosts of the castle begin to make their presences known especially Martin who won't give up on trying to seduce Sharon. (funniest parts of the movie if you ask me).On Halloween night things come to ahead and Jack and Mary get it on which afterwords puts him up the the ultimate test of love. Sharon unknowingly gives up her life for Mary and takes her place to be with Martin.By the end everyone is happily ever after. Honestly Liam Neeson was my favorite character of the whole thing and Peter O'Toole was brilliant.

It's a very rare time to witness the comic part of director (Neil Jordan) the guy who'll direct later a chain of very serious and cheerless films in the 1990s like for instances (The Crying Game (1992), Interview with the Vampire (1994), Michael Collins (1996), or The End of the Affair (1999). So to perfect such a fantastic romantic comedy as cheery, tumultuous and simple as this, is something really wired and historical for him.Actually it's more like an old ghost story collides with any wacky comedy from the 1930s' cinema, yet achieving a real originality that makes it one of the 1980s' nicest flicks. The cast was perfect. Forget that (Darryl Hannah) was at her worst, because even that can't take from the movie's high light personality. The wonderful showy efforts of (Peter O'Toole) accord with this atmosphere and harmonize with it. He was loose as the defeated miserable drunken Peter Plunkett, adding a tasty flavor to the character's bitterly sarcastic way, being definitely a treat to watch apart since there is no such hilarious precedent in (O'Toole)'s antecedent career. Also, I refuse to accept the dim-witted remarks about him here as he was playing himself. Because aside from that as something I don't buy, he was too good in his role to be a miserable defeated actor by all means.The comedy is swift, the pace is crazy, and the sets are so inspiring. There is a certain delight and bright sense all the time in the movie's image. The sexiness is over-the-top with mega-gorgeous babes  (Beverly D'Angelo) was outrageously sexy, (Jennifer Tilly) isn't bad herself, and even an extra by the name of (Hilary Reynolds), who played near to silent maid, fascinated me utterly. It even managed to have a genuine tender message as well about real love and how it brings life to everyone and everything around. I liked the frisky end where every soul met its fair match. Makes you wish  if life was like this ! There are sensitive bits or so droll ones to cartonnish extent that push me to rethink  who was exactly the man that directed the list of movies that I've mentioned previously ? (Jordan) himself has always maintained that the release version of this movie is very different from the one he shot, insisting that his version is still locked away in a vault. According to long experience with (Jordan)'s other works (in fact all of them !) I say keep it in the vault, this one is so satisfying as it is. Thanks to the funny spirit whoever made it like this anyway. Because when it comes to an entertaining movie, I find nothing to ask more than what this one has.

The ghosts of their ancestors are offended by the fake ghosts so they lend their expertese to save the castle. The humor and the jokes are very good, but some of the hauntings, specifically the nuns, are better than others.

That is until snooty Beverly D'Angelo arrives with the intention of claiming it. Her neglected husband (Steve Guttenberg) begins to see a ghostly murder repeated over and over, and his interference changes the course of history at the castle. Harmless fun, this popcorn film is a modern day Canterville Ghost that has plenty of laughs, a lot of romance, and a few scares. Handsome Peter Gallagher (as a priest who has not taken his final vows) and vinegary voiced Jennifer Tilly appear in smaller roles that serve no purpose although the flying bed that Tilly is on ended up on the original poster.I discovered Liz Smith (no relation to the famous New York columnist) in the late 80's when she made a slew of British produced movies released to American audiences, and fell absolutely in love with her. She reminded me of a slightly classier Hermoine Baddley. Gorgeous Darryl Hannah and rugged Liam Neeson are excellent as the ghosts who surprisingly find love with the mortals haunting their ancestral home. D'Angelo, one of the wonders of the 80's (because I always wonder what happened to her until I investigated after seeing this movie again!), is beautiful, snooty, imperious, funny, and riveting. The only acting disappointment for me was Guttenberg whose acting style seems oddly out of place from the rest of the cast. While this will be greatly compared to other supernatural comedies such as Beetlejuice and Hocus Pocus (as well as the disastrous Haunted Honeymoon), it is still fun on its own merits.

If you like watching actors overact like crazy and run around like headless chickens all over the set then maybe this film is for you, but I prefer a little more restraint in my comedies. HIGH SPIRITS is an odyssey of dated effects work, slapstick gags, and a convoluted ghost romance plot that doesn't really go anywhere.The plot is straightforward stuff indeed, with the owner of an ailing hotel in Ireland (Peter O'Toole, phoning it in) deciding to turn his business into a haunted castle in order to drum up some trade.

I'm no fan of Daryl Hannah, but Liam Neeson is fun in an early role as a ghost, and Steve Guttenberg is a dependable lead type.

And as is the case with those horror movies the event that took place in this movie is the murder of a woman by her jealous husband. This movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination, it is a comedy. I think some people are visiting the castle and staying there when all the ghost stuff starts happening. It has its moments when it is rather funny as Peter O'Toole is the best member of the cast as far as being funny, then the movie gets right down into being a sort of romance movie. Then the movie ends in a rather unrealistic way, leaving you to think what is up with that. There is also a sex scene that gets rather intense for a PG-13 rated movie so you may want to think twice about letting the kids see this one.

But when the spirits of his ancestors catch wind of the foreclosure, they take matters in to their own hands.This film is Peter O'Toole. If you like him, like his accent or whatever about him, you might like this film... but beyond that, it's a bit of a flop. Steve Guttenberg is here after his career peaked, Daryl Hannah described as beautiful but looking nasty, Peter Gallagher in a humorous but small role and Liam Neeson in makeup not really allowing his talent to shine.As a comedy, the film does not have much to offer. As a horror film, it has even less. It may be sort of a romantic comedy, but not really... the story just does not go anywhere. I find most of the supporting cast annoying or unnecessary, and it strikes me as an excuse to cast Irish actors and bring some revenue to Ireland... but this film even fails as a tourism promotion.I won't say I entirely disliked it. It was watchable, and even though I think the plot was a bit inconsistent at times (can ghosts touch people or not?) it was an interesting idea. Probably not original... probably not even a little bit.

After his first three films, Neil Jordan was comfortably in the vanguard of Irish film-makers, the early promise of Angel having been apparently confirmed by The Company of Wolves and Mona Lisa. High Spirits however, attracted almost uniformly negative reviews, and together with Jordan's next film We're No Angels, was taken as signalling not just the beginning of the end of Neil Jordan's career, but as dealing a blow to the confidence of a nascent national film industry. The thinking went If Jordan can't make a decent picture in Hollywood, who can? In the forgive and forget revisionism of the post-Crying Game era, however, High Spirits has been reconsidered as a regrettable but ultimately pardonable aberration. That said, the film unquestionably ranks at the bottom of the Jordan canon, featuring the worst acting and dialogue of any of his films, delivered by a cast clearly chosen with an eye to the American market. Hence the inclusion of such semi- A-List stars Steve Guttenberg and Darryl Hannah neither of whom seem sure where to pitch their performances in the context of a predominantly Irish cast hence Guttenberg offers a mix of Police Academy tomfoolery with Cocoon innocence whereas Darryl Hannah exhibits a range of very 20th century facial tics in portraying an 18th century lass. Some of the Irish cast members - Donal McCann, Ray McAnally and in particular Liam Neeson - acquit themselves with more dignity but it is nonetheless an Irish actor - Peter O'Toole - who delivers what is, even by the generally low standards of the film, the hammiest performance, all louche glances, theatrical sighs and imprecations to heaven for assistance. There's little point in dwelling on the tacky dialogue beyond expressing bewilderment that it could have come from the same person who had previously and who has since displayed such a gift for using ordinary language to explore political and emotional issues of quite extraordinary complexity (witness Mona Lisa, Crying Game & Michael Collins).In its defence it has been argued that the film was taken out of Jordan's hands at the editing stage and completed by the studiowho imposed a feel good style on the picture and muted the more disturbing elements. There is some evidence within the film to support this. Thus it is possible to uncover some potentially interesting submerged themes, if one is prepared to dig deep enough Sharon, it emerges is a direct blood line descendent of Martin's but the incestuous element in their relationship is glossed over. There is also the beginnings of a discussion of the inevitable differences between the tourist portrayal of Ireland as land of myth and mystery and the reality of everyday existence here. But this too is submerged into what becomes a portrayal of Ireland out of the Bord Failte textbook (although the characterisation of the Irish as willing to go to any lengths to gull Americans out of their money somewhat undermines this). Further evidence of interference in the editing lies in the incomprehensibility of the narrative. At time there is no narrative, just a sequence of increasingly bizarre unconnected events. When the film finally reaches its end, there's no sense of closure, rather one feels that the filmmakers simply got bored and went home. Given all the foregoing it seems doubtful that even had Jordan retained full creative control in postproduction, that he could have rendered this sow's ear into a silk purse. As such the most interesting question about High Spirits remains how such a dumb film could have come from a manifestly intelligent and gifted filmmaker  "},{"Title":"Low spirits...low returns","Date":"30 April 2006","Score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Writer-director Neil Jordan (on a roll after the critically-acclaimed Mona Lisa) nearly took his name off the credits of this low-level whimsy, saying the final result had been altered by outsiders.

Jaw-droppingly poor, heavy-handed comedy has tourists in an ancient Irish castle mixing it up with the ghostly apparitions residing there. The cast (including Peter O'Toole, Steve Guttenberg, Daryl Hannah, Liam Neeson, Beverly D'Angelo and Jennifer Tilly--a highly uneven troupe if there ever was one!) cannot get a grip on their characters and flounder (they should've threaten to remove their names as well).

While talking to his mother about the problem, she mentions all of the ghosts of the castle. That sparks an idea--to market Castle Plunkett to tourists as a hotel that's the most haunted destination in the world, or the western hemisphere, or some such. When the first group of tourists arrives, Plunkett's crew puts forward a slapdash effort to feign hauntings, but it turns out that the castle may be really haunted after all.Yowza, what a mess this film is! I had a quick sinking feeling during the credits when writer/director Neil Jordan's name came up. Although I've only seen four of his films so far, I can only remember liking one of them, We're No Angels--and this is coming from a reviewer who likes the great majority of films that he sees. Still I was prepared to give it a generous chance. After all, I love horror comedies from Ghostbusters to Young Frankenstein, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Cannibal--The Musical.There are a host of problems with High Spirits * The film isn't very funny. Granted, comedies need not make you laugh out loud to succeed. At it's best, High Spirits can be cute, and I did smile a bit. But a lot of the film was an almost embarrassing attempt at humor.* Jordan apparently directed the actors to amp it up as if this were a stage performance. Everyone severely overacts, turning into super-hams and frequently yelling their lines. It's even worse when a whole gaggle of actors does this at the same time, which happens frequently here. I know I've complained elsewhere about mumbling and whispering in recent films, but I'll take that any day over this kind of overacting. This flaw is especially strange given that many members of the cast have been great in other films.* Even though it should be fairly straightforward, the plot frequently confused me. Why the family would still be making payments on the castle was never clear to me. I didn't get where the tourists came from all of a sudden. It didn't seem to be the case that this small group of tourists would help the hotel/castle raise the money it needed within a few weeks. Also, a large number of events seemed random. I didn't know why they were happening, and I didn't really care. Which brings me to the next problem * There didn't seem to be any ground rules laid down for the film's world, and any that were laid down seemed to be frequently contradicted. At times, the film plays like there wasn't even a script, but Jordan had access to a nifty old castle in Ireland, so on the fly, they just made up what they thought would be wacky set-pieces.Remarkably, there were also a number of things that the film did right* The first section of the film, featuring the castle's bunch of rag tags trying to pull off a haunted house for the bunch of rag tag tourists, had a lot of potential. Even if it wouldn't have been hilarious, it could have been a charming comedy in the classical literary sense of comedy, if High Spirits would have stuck with this material, toned down the overacting, and made an attempt at a logical script.* Some of the ghost material and haunted house effects were enjoyable. Again, they weren't funny, but there was also potential here to make an effective haunted house film, even if lighter in mood. The crypt zombie-ghosts were great, but only showed up for a minute or two.* The castle and grounds were fantastic. They could have easily provided a setting for a film as good as Roger Corman's Vincent Price films. There were a couple nice bits of cinematography showing off the castle and grounds, as well.* The love stories at the end almost started working for me. Again, this might have been a more effective direction on which to focus the majority of the film. The minor characters dropped out at this point (and really, the cast was too big, because most of them were wasted), the overacting was toned-down, and the non-sequitur plot elements dropped out.My final verdict? The positive elements brought the film up to a 5 out of 10. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. I can't recommend it, but it is perhaps worth watching on cable or renting at least once for die-hard fans of horror comedies.

It has the potential to do that but the more Hollywood it gets, the less fun it becomes. The movie concentrates too much on the Americans.

But I also hated the humour. Even by 80s standard, this just isn't funny. The film is trying to compensate with noise, but none of the gags are even remotely funny, not to mention none of it makes any sense at all. When the film starts throwing nonsense at you for no apparent reason, it generates contempt. When joke after stupid joke fails to work, it generates contempt. When characters turn out to be dull, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts, it generates contempt. So by the time the 'twist' in the plot comes about, the audience is already exhausted and filled with contempt. And then one realizes that the 'twist', telegraphed from the very start of the film, brings nothing new. It's the same old moronic gags and a love story that goes nowhere. It is a shame to see a potentially good idea for a film, a pretty good cast, and a decent budget squandered like this. Why did we put up with Steve Guttenberg back in the 80s anyway? He's just awful. Frankly, I don't know how to judge this film. It does remind me of my childhood and the wonderful 80s which are gone forever.

Peter's attempt's at fooling his guests into thinking the Castle is haunted fail miserably, however all is not lost as then the real ghosts take over. Much hilarity ensues, not...This English American co-production was written & directed by Neil Jordan & quite frankly I think High Spirits is a pretty bad film. The script is a muddled mess, there are sporadic moments of supposed comedy, there's an awful romance between American tourist Steve Guttenberg & ghost Daryl Hannah, there's stupid drama & it tries to chuck some horror into the mix as well. None of it works, it never comes together as one coherent piece & the fact that it's so unfunny, childish, predictable & rather boring doesn't help my love for it. The character's are clichéd, the ghosts are underused & did I mention that it wasn't funny yet? So here we have a film that tries to be a horror comedy but fails on both counts, High Spirits is not a film I look back on with any fondness. At all.Director Jordan has apparently gone on record as saying that he had no input over the editing process & what was released was substantially different to his original cut, to be honest that sounds like an excuse for making such a bad film as he still directed the scenes which ended up on screen, it was still his script this mess came from & quite frankly how much difference could there have been? Was there hours of unused footage? Would any of it been any funnier if there was? I imagine the studio probably tweaked it a bit but maybe because Jordan's original cut was even worse, I just don't believe this 'it would have been brilliant if the studio had left it alone' rubbish., anyway I guess we'll never find out either way... I must admit the film looks quite nice with good sets although the special effects vary between impressive & poor. On a side note did anyone else notice the white horse Guttenberg lands in front of when he falls out of the tree hit by lightening (don't ask)? I'm positive you can see the horse's penis dangling between it's legs, not that I specifically look out for these things you understand...Technically High Spirits is fine with decent production values. Looking at the cast list it's pretty impressive although no one covers themselves in glory, O'Toole is good but that's it. Gutteneberg tries to act all emotional, oh dear...High Spirits is a comedy that simply isn't funny & it's story is a mess that doesn't entertain, I don't know what else to say other than I didn't like it. Could have been better, much better. Watch Ghostbusters (1984) instead to see how a proper supernatural comedy should be done. "}]
