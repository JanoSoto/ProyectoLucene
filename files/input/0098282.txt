[{"Title":"Very funny pairing of the two wonderful comic actors","Date":"22 June 2003","Score":"32 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I remember first seeing this movie when I was about five years old, and I found it hilarious.  I caught the movie a couple more times on network TV, but this is the first time I watched it again in its unedited form. Needless to say, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder are both wonderful talents with an irreplacable chemistry, and that chemistry is utilized very well throughout.  Of course, the brilliantly original premise helps as well.  A blind guy and a deaf guy who pair up to solve a murder?  Classic!  That premise is used wonderfully.  There's a great line where they're interrogated and angry officer screams out, Between the two of you, you saw and heard everything!  There's a lot of great fish-out-of-water humor involving Pryor's blindness and Wilder's deafness.  One of the most hilarious gags, along with the car chase, is when Pryor helps another blind man to walk across the street, and they end up in the back of a truck.  Now that's a literal example of the blind leading the blind.  Each gag is delivered and timed very well, thanks for the great actors and veteran director Arthur Hiller, who has directed the two leads before in Silver Streak.  This isn't a perfect comedy.  A few gags fall flat, but the key word is few.  Some reviewers and audiences have regarded this as the low point in Wilder's and Pryor's careers.  I think of Another You as the low point, which is a horribly forgettable comedy that unfortunately was the last film they did together.A good deal of the gags are far-fetched, but this is a slapstick farce and you have to expect that.  That's why I always say that this is a very tricky sub-genre and if not done correctly, the audience will totally stop suspending disbelief and simply scoff at its foolishness.Fans of Pryor and Wilder should not be disappointed.  Also, if you want to see an early (comic) performance by Kevin Spacey, it's also worth checking out.  Speaking of worth checking out, Joan Severance provides great eye candy, and she has a couple of nude scenes to boot.  I was born in 1982, so this was the first movie where I saw the two comics together on screen, so See No Evil is more unique to me than it probably is to others.  But come on!  With scenes like a high-speed car chase involving a blind man and a deaf man trying to escape, how can this not be regarded as a unique comedy?  My score  7 (out of 10)    "},{"Title":"The funniest Wilder/Pryor movie","Date":"22 January 2002","Score":"34 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Just saw this movie again recently, and it still gets me laughing like crazy.

That's two man, Richard Pryor as the blind guy (perfect choice by the way) and one of his best friends of all time, the talented Gene Wilder, who make the guy who can't hear. So he follow the words on the mouths of people. The plot is yet simple but effective. The beautiful Joan Severance and a unknown Kevin Spacey at that time make the villains in this movie. They are so credible, that you believe them. So I would say one thing about this movie and it's MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! You have 2 talented actors and you don't even care about the script anymore because they are so talented than they can make look good any movie they are involved to. Here, we have a good storyline, so it helps even more. You laugh about all the time even when you think ''It's too stupid to make this'', yeap, but you laugh because you are watching one of the best comedies of all times. The writing stuff is genius, they make this movie and probably at that time, it was another movie like this, but as of today, it has become a cult classic for every Richard Pryor fans!

On the face of it they're both so utterly unfunny that they come full circle on the crapometer right back round to funny. You have to hand it to them. These guys have made several films together, all of which are arguably quite rubbish, yet I always wizz myself laughing whenever I watch any of them. By the way, for all you Wilder/Pryor slapstick-duo film fan freaks out there, I stole that amazingly funny quote in my summary from the back of the Stir Crazy box. So sue me if I want to use the best line I've ever read on the back of a video box ever, anywhere in the whole wide world. You know, you should always judge a film by it's cover, and even more so by the description on the back. How could you not fall over, doubled-up in uncontrollable fits of laughter, face contorting, body spasming in the video store when you see Pryor/Wilder on the front cover of a video, one pretending he can't see, the other pretending he can't hear. Then you read the back cover and you nearly die laughing before you reach the counter due to the over-use of words such as, crazy, zany, nuts, wacko, crackers, mad-cap, caper, loony, escapades, hilarious, romp etc. etc. I mean, if you've ever seen this film, you'll know what a total load of lies that is, but they're real funny lies. All this and you have not even left the video store. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but any film that has normal, well adjusted members of the film watching community thrashing about on the floor of a video store, really should have cleaned up at the oscars.

They're as normal as every other human being around, except for one difference Dave is deaf and Wally is blind. They meet one day when Wally looks, or rather seeks, a job at Dave's news stand. Their encounter doesn't go too well but is quite hilarious. Wally invites Dave to meet a friend of his, Harvey Wallbanger. So at the bar, a fight ensues.                The next day, there was a murder at the news stand. Wally heard it and Dave saw it, almost. But when the cops show up, they figure Dave and Wally are the killers and take them into custody. The surly Captain Braddock tries to interrogate them but isn't too successful. The real killers, Kirgo and Eve, act as Wally and Dave's attorney. They recognize them immediately but Braddock doesn't believe them, so they must escape or face real trouble. So they escape and snatch a patrol car. Only problem Wally was driving. They end up on a garbage boat bound for New Jersey.                They immediately recuperate and seek help from Wally's sister, Adele. They try and catch the killers in a hotel by using aliases. Wally is Dr. Johansen of Sweden and Dave is Dr. Kesselring from Germany. Kirgo and Eve kidnap Adele and head for their hideout. Wally and Dave come to the rescue and meet the head boss behind it all Mr. Sutherland, who is blind like Wally. Well in the end, the real killers go to jail, except for Kirgo and Sutherland who are killed. And Captain Braddock was disappointed because he couldn't shoot Dave and Wally.

So they are off on a wild chase to first escape the police, then avoid recapture and finally find the people responsible for the murder. It plays out very well as by now Gene and Richard work perfectly together. Kind of a shame that Gene does not really appear in anything these days or for the last several years. He was a very funny comedic actor to be sure. This film is funny to be sure as well. A lot of good humor and it never really has to many sentimental moments either.

At some points in the film, you realize how intolerant and harsh the world is toward anyone with frailties, which brings you back down to earth with a bump. Though, Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are two highly underrated talents before the camera. The adventures that these two poor characters go through is something that a wide audience can enjoy. The use of two ailments such as deafness and blindness is not exploited or made fun of, just used for great comic timing and situations.

The premise of the film is very simple and centres around 2 men - Wally Karue (Pryor) and Dave Lyons (Wilder). Karue is blind and Wilder is deaf and they meet when Karue applies for a position at the same company that Lyons works for. Whilst on shift together, there is a murder in the shop where they are working. Due to the circumstances of the murder, Lyons and Karue are initially framed for the murder - (the victim gets shot, but Lyons had his back turned and didn't hear the gun fire and Karue couldn't see the person who fired the gun so technically neither of them 'witnessed the murder')What follows is an hilarious sequence of events in which Lyons and Karue set out to find the person responsible for the murder and at the same time try to prove their innocence. The murderer also has their own agenda when they discover that a gold coin (which is meant to be delivered to their boss in a suitcase with some additional equipment has gone missing and they attempt to track it down).Both Pryor and Wilder are fantastic in their respective roles (as I mentioned above I felt that Pryor stole the show as Karue and I felt he gave a better performance - if you look at his eyes throughout the film he genuinely does look as though he is blind which just shows how talented he was. Wilder was also good, but he didn't come across as being quite as convincing as Pryor. Kevin Spacey gave a great performance in an early role as the villainous Kirgo and Joan Severance is his accomplice - her performance as Eve I felt was merely adequate.

Some people call it a dud and others say not that funny, but this will be the first positive review of the film I have seen (or read for that matter).I didn't know what to expect from the title, or the actors. I have never watched Pryor or Wilder in a movie (no, I haven't seen Willy Wonka). I have seen bits and pieces of Pryor's Comedy but when you put him in a movie where he plays a blind guy, he needs to be confused.Pryor plays Wally, who's blind and near clueless. Wilder plays Dave, deaf and doesn't want to admit it. Get the connection? When a shot is fired right in front of Dave's stand, neither one saw or heard what happened. Dave picks up the gun and now the police are after them for their fake murder. The duo are being chased as well by the people that actually committed the murder Eve (Joan Severance) and Captain Braddock (Alan North) who are on the hunt for a gold coin that Wally and Dave stole after finding it placed in their change drawer.The movie needs to be slow paced in order for the movie to catch up with the characters. Seeing as they are blind and deaf, the movie seems to be progressing faster then the characters. At points it feels that the movie wants to go faster, but since the characters are slow, the film needs to be slow.Still a funny movie in places, I think after seeing this, for their troubles, I think the blind and deaf are given maximum brain power to think more clearly. If thats not the case, excuse me because thats how they are portrayed in this movie.

In the film, Gene plays a deaf store owner named Dave who has gone his whole deaf life hiding the fact that he cannot hear what people are saying and can only read their lips. When Dave meets Wally, a blind man played by Pryor, the two become instant buds and help each other get things done with their handicaps. Until the two witness a murder but cannot truly give a story or be ruled out as suspects because neither of the both heard and saw what occurred so they are taken in by the law and go through many shenanigans on the way to explaining the truth. It is wildly hilarious and can fill the void for any good comedy night.

From start to finish, hilarious scenes kept me laughing until my throat was sore.Upon deciding to make this film, Gene Wilder made many changes to create a kinder, gentler script about people with disabilities -- the result is the funniest movie possible about a blind man (Pryor as Wally) and a deaf man (Wilder as Dave) who witness a murder. Dave is hesitant and reluctant to do anything that would make him look foolish to others while Wally is so self confident that he walks around without a cane as if he could see. But trouble lies ahead when Wally leads the way -- literally.I enjoyed 'Silver Streak' immensely years ago but 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil' is more a classic - no matter that you've seen it before several times, the irresistible charm of Gene and Richard in amazing scenes make you laugh all over again.

It's just too perfunctory and bland to keep up with the leads, so come the end, it's as if everyone else has given up and just let the two take over.The comedy is stupid and very derogatory, but at the end of the day, it's the cinematic equivalent of watching an old lady fall over.

I noticed that another film with this pairing (Wilder and Pryor) was rated higher than this one, that film being Stir Crazy, which i knew existed but never got round to watching, and no one i know had ever spoken of.After watching Stir Crazy i no longer have any faith in the IMDb users, and i no longer care about the top250 or any other chart on here, which i actually used to refer and give credit to quite a lot. I laughed all the way through See no evil, and i would class it as one of the funniest films to date. I laughed twice at Stir Crazy, which does not mean i didn't enjoy it, but it is nowhere near as good as this film, and I've read many reviews saying this is worse. To give this film a poorer rating than Stir Crazy is shameful.See no Evil is a comedy film and it does exactly that. You're not supposed to go into the cinema expecting a riveting, well thought of storyline. Just something that keeps the film flowing whilst the laughs take centre stage. Also, looking at the chart, there is an abundance of comedy films near the top. This begs the question why people don't rate comedy films very highly? If it makes you laugh practically throughout, and you enjoy it, then it should get a high rating, should it not? I think all these critics forget the purpose of a comedy film, and just look to rip the story lines apart, and probably go into the theater with the attitude of 'i bet this doesn't make me laugh'. Take your critique head off, and try and just have some fun. See no evil is a barrel of laughs and easy a 9 out of 10, with excellent acting from the main pairing.

The deaf guy didn't hear it but he saw the perpetrator walking away. Both guys work in the same news kiosk, and in the aftermath they are initially suspects and conveniently end up with a key piece of evidence on their person, something the real killers badly want.Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor made a few films in the 80s as a duo. They were usually OK - but only OK, but this premise somehow works well for them. The early going basically shows the extent of their respective afflictions and how they deal with the everyday activities, and how they both are desperate to live as normal a life as possible without unwanted pity or attention from others.Pryor is Wally the blind guy, and Wilder is David the deaf guy who reads lips, neither blindness nor deafness is treated as a cause for a laugh, but the filmmakers do throw a few cheapies in, walking into doors, misreading lips etc...The killers are Joan Severance and Kevin Spacey. I was maybe 15 when this first arrived on video and there is a topless scene that goes for a good (and I mean good) couple minutes that held my fragile mind captive for a long while.Once the murder occurs right in front of the blind guy and behind the deaf guy the action starts. In a convenient turn of events the deceased is Wally's bookie so they are taken into custody under suspicion of murder.As the plot is largely there to facilitate the jokes I'll put this on FF from here.>>>> Wally and David escape custody and go on the run, they immediately run into the real killers who retrieve their target and decide to kill them rather than risk them blabbing the truth. Again of course our sensorally-challenged heroes escape and go about getting to the bottom of things. They cannot rely on police assistance as they are still technically wanted fugitives, and the guys they are chasing are intent on killing them, so they induct Wally's sister into the gang. (She has no noticeable disabilities.) The chase takes them to the hotel where the killers are lying low and ultimately a mansion on a mountainside for the final face-off.As well as the fine chesticles displayed by Severance the other thing that struck me upon rewatching this film is just how funny it all still is, everyone knows Pryor is funny but as Wally he provides laughter from the first scene until the last and even when the plot stoops to gutter humour he still manages to make it funny. There are phrases and jokes that I have used for years and had forgotten their origin, I now know that more than a few of them came from this film.Final Rating - 8 / 10. Forget the dopey poster and the fact that you probably don't know who the guys on the cover are. This is funny stuff and worth a look. (The DVD release does edit the topless scene a lot though boys... sorry.)

Silver Streak was a terrific opener for them; Stir Crazy had plenty to enjoy but ran out of steam before the end; See No Evil, Hear No Evil is only sporadically funny with rather too many scenes and jokes done in bad taste; Another You - their final film together - was just unutterably dreadful. The third film just mentioned - See No Evil, Hear No Evil - should have been somewhat better than it is. For one thing it saw the two stars reunited with their Silver Streak director Arthur Hiller; for another, it features powerful supporting actors in the shape of Kevin Spacey and Anthony Zerbe. Such talent should, quite rightly, be expected to deliver the goods.... but, for various reasons, this film doesn't quite live up to expectation.Deaf news vendor Dave Lyons (Wilder) gives a job to blind man Wally Carew (Pryor). One day, whilst Wally is outside waiting for a newspaper delivery, a man is shot dead in Dave's store. Wally didn't see the crime, but he heard the shot and got a good whiff of the killer's (Joan Severance) perfume as she fled the scene. Dave didn't hear it (he was reading a medication box when the shot was fired) but he saw the killer from behind as she slipped away. However, when the police arrive at the murder scene they presume that Wally and Dave are responsible and promptly apprehend them! The killer and her accomplice Kurgo (Kevin Spacey) are dismayed when they discover that the object they were trying to obtain from the victim - a gold coin - is still in Dave and Wally's possession. They plan to get the two men out on bail so that they can regain the coin and kill the two unsuspecting witnesses.... but Dave and Wally sense the danger, and make a new plan of their own. The handicapped duo break out of jail and try to solve the murder by themselves, pursued on one hand by the cops and on the other by the real killers.First of all, if you get easily offended when disabled people are the butt of a joke then See No Evil, Hear No Evil is not the film for you. However, if you can ignore or at least forgive the tastelessness inherent in the premise, there are occasional giggles to be had. Perhaps the best laughs come when Dave and Wally pose as European doctors in order to gain access to an exclusive hotel. Also amusing is a frantic car chase sequence in which passenger Dave screams at Wally don't look at me, watch the road! To which blind Wally, who is driving, nonchalantly replies Ah well, if it makes you feel better.... The foul language comes thick and fast - perhaps excessively so for a film that is intended as a light comedy. There's also some crudeness that seems not so much funny as misplaced. Do you have any last requests? asks the murderer as she prepares to blow Wally away. I suppose a f@ck is out of the question? he answers. See No Evil, Hear No Evil has its moments, but viewers wanting to see the two stars at their best should stick with Silver Streak or Stir Crazy, both of which are considerably better.

Being the third movie pairing of both Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor the movie reeled in many fans to go see it after the acceptable Silver Streak and Stir Crazy although some fans appreciated it, the movie was a sign that both have lost it, which may have been a good reason why the last pairing was a failure.See no evil, hear no evil, is about two men; one blind man named Wally Karew (Richard Pryor) and a deaf man named Dave Lyons (Gene Wilder), who are both struggling to accept their disability.Wally is out of a job and he meets Dave who offered him a job at his place, there while the blind and deaf are working together a man is shot right there in the store. The police now have two witnesses, blind Wally and deaf Dave.The problem wasn't the murder; the problem was that the only witnesses to the murder i.e. blind Wally who just smelt and heard the murderer leave and deaf Dave who saw the murderer's leg as they turn to leave the store.Now both have to find a way to prove that there is a murderer out there.If you want to see, good acting and convincing blind and deaf acts being pulled on the screen well you can take a whiff of the DVD, but it does contain a weak script and a forgettable story line and I advise you use your free buck to get something else and stay away from this.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"An average comedy featuring two great talents.","Date":"16 May 2004","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  This used to be one of my favourites as a kid but when I watched it after may years it just was not the same.Featuring a very unique plot about two people involved in a murder one who could not see it the other that could not hear it and combined they know everything.As far as I can remember this is the earliest Kevin Spacey movie I have seen.Even though it features to great comedy talents and has a feel good factor about it, there's nothing special about it.

When Pryor's bookie is murdered inside Wilder's Manhattan convenience store (while his back is turned and Pryor hears the gunshots), it is obvious that they will end up being accused, and the absence of their different senses draws them together as they must support each other and communicate only through Wilder's ability to read lips and Pryor's ability to hear. A combination of both a Road movie and Mel Brook's High Anxiety (already a spoof itself, of Hitchcock films), this utilizes much tactless humor to give us the adventure which leads up to the obvious conclusion. While High Anxiety took Brooks and Madeline Kahn all over San Francisco, this film gives us a look at late 80's Manhattan, from the very lower east side, an obvious under construction West Side Highway and ultimately somewhere in New Jersey. The chase seen is to this film what San Francisco was to Bullitt, and it never lets you look away. Pryor and Wilder don't have the good material here that they had in Silver Streak and Semi-Tough, but unless you are too politically correct to enjoy a good laugh at the expense of the handicapped, you will find yourself embarrassed by laughing. Wilder's character, in particular, is an angry deaf man, and the initial meeting between him and Pryor (plus a later fight between the two of them and a bully in a bar) are truly angry in the way they deliver their humor.

But somehow you have to make it funny, and that's why laugh tracks were invented.All throughout this movie, I kept wondering why I wasn't laughing, and it occurred to me that it was because it needed a laugh track.  There are no jokes here, no humorous events, only eternal mugging by Wilder and Pryor as they bumble through one absurd escapade after another.  I think this is what is meant by character-driven comedy; it's not what happens that is funny, it's how the characters react to it that's supposed to be funny.At least that's how it works in theory.  For me, I didn't get a single chuckle out of it.  Not to say that it's a bad movie; pairing a blind man and a deaf man and asking them to work their way together through a madcap caper is a great idea.

It's not news, but it still isn't an excuse.See No Evil, Hear No Evil gives Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor another chance to team after the wonderful work they've done together in films like Stir Crazy and Silver Streak.  Unfortunately, those scripts were much funnier and used Wilder's and Pryor's contrasting personalities as a springboard for the laughs.  Big difference here; it's just a blind guy (Pryor) and a deaf guy (Wilder) who collectively witness a murder and are on the run from the cops and the hit-men responsible.  Unfortunately, there's not a trace of either's personal ticks or traits they had in previous outings.  Their characters could have been played by anyone in particular, without any noticeable changes in the film itself.But when you have supporting players like Joan Severance and Kevin Spacey and they make no impression, you know something is very wrong. Still there are a few scattered laughs and occasional bright spots, like where Pryor drives a getaway car and Wilder tells him where to turn (COWS!  COWS!  COWS!).  But so much time is spent on the plot itself (deadly business for a comedy) that there's no time left for laughs. Too bad, they had the makings for a classic, but missed the boat.

Hey, anyone for a Silver Streak sequel?

It was pretty intresting for me but i have never watched it in a cinema. I have just seen it on tv 3-4 years ago. It was not TOO funny but it was pretty nice and intresting because of the story of the movie. I dont want to say bad or good things about the movie. Its just a comedy movie. not more not less. "}]
