[{"Title":"respectable directorial debut for Cube","Date":"5 March 2002","Score":"12 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Unremarkable but ambitious story from writer-director Ice Cube. A young woman recalls her emotionally wrenching experiences while working at a raunchy black strip club. More specifically, she remembers the burden of dealing with sleazy customers, reprehensible rivals, and wild parties on the side, all the while doing her best to maintain her dignity while working to better her life. Intriguing story is accompanied by a talented cast, powerful moments, and some fine performances, but too often resorts to familiar plot twists and lame stereotypes. Not a bad piece of work for first time director Cube, but would have benefited from more creativity. ** "},{"Title":"Make the money...Don't let it make you","Date":"1 September 2005","Score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" An Ice Cube film&#133;Wow, that's already big enough. Not that Ice Cube is the biggest celebrity of the planet, but he is an actor I appreciate; too much. He is honest, simple; pure. He is a rapper, a musician who writes songs for films, and is good at it, besides being a low profile artist. Plus, he is a very good actor who does what he pleases and likes to and never disappoints. With the production company he has, he could have the highest ego, but he continues on doing his job.In 1998, he got his chance to direct his movie; his first and only up to date. He wouldn't do the stupid gangster films the other rappers do because he takes the job seriously; so seriously he wrote his own neighborhood and people story, which is unexpectedly touching in its most impressive moments. He had done that type of film before, with independent man John Singleton, among others in that film I regret not seeing yet, Boyz N' the Hood. Whether he got inspiration from there or not, I don't care, but the screenplay is his.In his tale, where he also allows a role for him, we meet Diana (a powerful and gripping performance by Lisa Raye), a young girl and aspiring journalist with a lot of problems that drive her towards working on a strippers club, to get money and become Diamond. In Dollar Bill's (original Bernie Mac) club, The players club, she is not the typical stripper, dancing with all the others; she has a special number, and some clients. Every day she deals with cousin Ebony (Monica Calhoun), who lives with her and has more than two times her problems; her unfaithful boyfriend and the different people in the club, including DJ Blue (a calm portrayal by Jamie Foxx), who likes her.Like in any other story, these are not the only ones in Cube's vision&#133;There are lots of them and each of them has their own thing that relates to another thing. However, Cube always keeps the story focused in its center point. His gift as a director (because he could have sucked) comes with the importance he gives to the camera. He has a desperate need to show things as real as possible, even if it is a fiction story, so his camera moves like eyes most of the times, like afraid of watching what's waiting on the other side, so the impact is harder when we seed alongside the camera. It is a very effective technique.What is also captivating and remarkable, is how much of him we can see in the film. Like directors of the league of Scorsese or Oliver Stone, Ice Cube tries to makes us see what he sees. There are a few scenes with enormous violence; glasses that break, shootings, people hurt&#133;We feel it, and it is hard to watch. I was thinking about Spike Lee, and how personal his movies are. I was shocked with the ending of Do the right thing, but I understood it was just Spike Lee expressing himself.I don't know what exactly the message Lee wanted to give was, I don't know what was going through his mind at the time, just as I didn't know what was Ice Cube thinking, so he could end up showing The players club in flames during the first frames of his movie.

Bernie Mac can make the most dramatic piece of dialogue into stand-up comedy with his extraordinary vocal strength and stamina.  I was very impressed with Ice Cube, his writing-directing debut, because, honestly, I didn't know he was capable.  I like how he staged the scenes and built suspense.

And in the film industry. But movies on the stripping game don't seem to. They never seem to be well-made, or much fun. Why? What's going on here? The characters and plot are so non-existent, they fall under the category of pornos without sex. And who wants to see that? Such on the form as Showgirls made one wish the makers had followed pornography by example and not tried to have plot.Good readers, take a deeep breath of relief that The Players Club has slightly higher-quality of strip than glitzy dives like Showgirls and Striptease. Not quite the British Oscar contender level of The Full Monty... but not quite a Striptease. Written and directed by old-school rap superstar Ice Cube, The Players Club is a posh, yet harsh feature dealing with women needing big money really fast and giving themselves over to this way in order to get it. Stripping changes who you are all over. Inside-and-out, Diana says.But hey--everybody needs money. Everyone wants more. Even if you're Trump, every single dollar... just isn't enough. We've all heard of the girl who turns trick in order as last resort. There are women who get into stripping 'cause they want worship, adoration. To control every man in the room--and her career. But there are those who just need to make mad money mad fast. When we meet Diana (LisaRaye), she's just had a fight with father over college. He throws her out. She leans on a guy for support. He gives her more than that. He gives her a child. Then he leaves her. Single black woman raises baby on her own, no means. Such a sad, familiar story. To make ends meet, she gets at a shoe-store job. Some strippers come in and tell her there are ways of making more money--much, much more. In high demand. You're in charge of your career, your clientèle, yourself. Diana, you're suddenly in charge of life.The The Players Club, a ritzy men's club it Atlanta. The place is always hopping like a horny-toad on hop with the kind of people you'd like to know. Players has a lot of the gimmicks as Striptease. One can only wonder... did The Ice see that movie... just before he wrote up this? A lot is pretty warmed-over. But despite blaxploitation roots and intentions, The Players Club boasts an A-list cast and production values, thanks to the powerful status name of The Ice Cube and New Line. Bernie Mac gives in his plum of the Players Club owner Dollar Bill. A eccentric cartoon who dresses like a pimp, promotes himself like Don King with that philosophical wisdom that one picks up on the street, from the school of hard knocks. Business, yet ghetto. John Amos and Faizon Love are a pair of sorta dirty-cops who frequent. They got that Amos and Andy-shtick with Amos playing it straight and Love going for laughs. Oscar-winner Foxx of Ray fame got his start in the biz as stand-up and here as Blue, it might've served him (and the freakin' movie) better had he done some of his act. You'd think the DJ at a strip club wouldn't be important (Bill even tells Blue that to his face at one point), but he proves to be the very thing that Diana needs--even pulling it all together in the final act.Looking at all this, I kept waiting for Pam Grier to pop up in some cameo (where she at least keep her clothes on). Players Club does make a lot of its characters colorful and eccentric while keeping a lot of them fairly human. Cube tries to juggle, not making it a specific genre--but a life film. His movie is comedy, drama, a thriller, and action flick... As a filmmaker, Ice dons the indie hat here--as screenwriter, executive producer, director and bit-player. Though at times, Cube's stuff feels tired, underdeveloped. He's credited also as exec producer, which I think means he green-lit his own project. It pays to have an objective eye. Could Cube's old director from Boyz 'N' The Hood Singelton have come down to give former Doughboy some sage advice? Despite it's blaxploitation roots, Club mostly tries to sidestep a lot of opportunities to make the whole thing really, really campy, going for the so bad, it's good laughs that helped the earlier white-stripper movies get some viewers. But there is some camp here and there--all unintentional, I'm sure. Cube ain't Spike Lee.He doesn't make all the women into the kind of creatures they seem to be in their act. He doesn't make all their customers into crazed rioting monkeys. Oh, no. No, no. The Ice has more respect for this than all that. And doesn't just fall back on the easy crutch of just peddling shots of naked flesh from near beginning-to-end. I wished Cube's partner-in-crime Chris Tucker from Friday had popped- up. Tucker is on-par with Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence as comic presence. Such talent, he's can bring even the deadest scene to life. Ol' Smokey made Friday a must-see, he could've made this all the better. There are times when Cube doesn't capture energy he needs to. As director, he seems to be just recording. The camera is on auto-pilot rather than capturing mood. No classic, no AFI's 100 Best, no one's absolute fave of all time--no. Still worth seeing. And blaxploitation is still alive, still thriving... somewhere in this world. Not thriving like the stripping game, or the world's oldest profession. But yeah, it's there... --A Believer in Big, Bad Black Cinema, Dane Youssef "},{"Title":"Buckin NECKID!!","Date":"2 April 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I'm not to sure if this was supposed to be serious, or a comedy&#133; There was a lot of funny stuff in it.

I liked his performances in Friday, Next Friday, Three Kings, and especially in Boyz 'N The Hood. Now the Cube attempts to direct a film, and this is his first project.Every Black American I've known has seen this movie; they have pride in seeing their brothers make films. Although this one is not great; it's watchable and it's quite good in spots.The story is about a young lady named Diana who comes from a well-off family. She had a child out of wedlock. Her parents want her to go to their alma mater, but she wants to go to another school that the parents disapprove. They get into a big fight, so she leaves them to go to her university of choice. Of course, she doesn't have enough money to go to school and raise her child, so she decides to become an exotic dancer at a black club. The club is owned by a man who is in big trouble with loan sharks.Later, a cousin comes to visit for the summer, and seeing Diana working there, decides to get a job there, too. Unfortunately, Ebony is drawn to the seediness of the people, and Diana must monitor her closely, because she's underage (18-19)Of course, all the usual stereotypes are here, the fat stripper who's booed of the stage, the outlandish show-offy dancers, the slow-witted stalkers, just like how it was done in Striptease, but it's not played for laughs. There is one funny scene in which the loan sharks stick Jamie Foxx's head in the car and drive around with him still on his feet when he tells them he doesn't know where the club owner (Bernie Mac) is.The acting is either weak or over-the-top. LisaRaye, as Diana, is not a good actress, but she does look good. The others are either weak as well or go way overboard. The ambience, though, is quite good. The direction is decent, but the script is filled with cliches and other Black sayings that have been done to death.Why did I compare it with the A-Team? Despite the extreme violence stemming from beatings, arson, assaults, etc. no one dies! Just like how The A-Team and the bad guys have balletic shoot-outs, no man is ever shot and killed. Not a single person is killed in this film, which at least is a positive thing; that every one gets a second chance to amend themselves. If you're a fan of Ice Cube; this isn't bad, but I'd rent it on the cheap if you've seen everything else.

Eventually the drama of the club gets intense and catches her up.I like Ice Cube as an actor.  He does stay in the `safe' comedy roles but he has also moved on well since his debut in Boyz n'da Hood.  Here he takes on his directorial debut and he does OK.  I mean the shots are nice and the camera moves around well enough.  Sadly he is let down on nearly every other front.  First off, the plot is pretty poor.  It's told in flashback and just seems to involve everyone swearing as our heroine tries to go her own way and move up and out etc etc.  We are `treated' to the odd dance and fight scene but really the bits don't all come together and it just feels like everyone is swearing over nothing all the time.The acting is surprisingly bad from several main sources.  Lisa Raye's narration is terrible but her performance is actually alright.  Calhoun is good looking and quite good but that's about it.  Mac is terrible, not funny or believable.  Foxx is not bad but could have done more.  Wilson and Givens are ugly and nasty &#150; they can't act and I find it hard to believe people actually paid Wilson to get naked!This film is basically a modern blackploitation film &#150; made for black people to come and watch regardless of quality.  The plot is average at best and the performances are mostly poor.  The plot is episodic and lacks drive or drama and will leave you feeling bored and distracted.
