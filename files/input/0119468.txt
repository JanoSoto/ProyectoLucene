[{"Title":"great acting from the lead, uninspired plot exposition","Date":"20 April 2004","Score":"49 out of 55 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  If you like serial killer films that like to tax your brain, you should probably give this movie a look (exactly the reasoning I was following when I picked this up at a video store). Chances are, you'll be entertained by what you see. Just don't expect this one to be a nailbiter like Silence of the Lambs or Se7en. This one comes across as more than a little forced, at times, something that can't be levelled against those two superior films.The plot setup is as follows. A forensic psychologist (whom we get to see in action in an unrelated case, as an introduction), Dr. Alex Cross (played by Morgan Freeman), is placed in a personal position when his niece disappears, among 8 other women -- two of which are soon found dead in a forest, clearly brutally raped earlier. Cross, a clever guy, soon determines that the other six are probably alive out there somewhere, including his niece. Meanwhile, a young doctor named Kate (Ashley Judd) is herself captured by the rapist/murder/etc. (we see the events unfolding from her perspective). She, however, manages to escape. Dr. Cross and she then try to solve the case, so that Cross's niece may be rescued.From here on, we get standard cop thriller fare -- and I'm not saying that as a bad thing, as such stories, when well crafted, are inherently interesting -- with a clear bond (not a romantic one) forming between Cross and Kate. Of course, plot twists abound (you get plenty of surprises about who the killer might be), until the inevitable (and a bit predictable) violent conclusion. Of course, the serial killer seems to be pretty kinky (an important element for a film like this); his depravity is, unfortunately (or fortunately?) never fully fleshed out.Through it all, Morgan Freeman does an admirable job. You feel the weight of his intellect and emotion, as he goes about this personal case, even when the script doesn't project this weight itself. It's fascinating to see a professional transcend this material so easily. Freeman makes this film, 100% -- he's not only realistic but also heavily charismatic (without seeming forced, as Al Pacino on late-career-autopilot seems to be). Ashley Judd does a good job, as does the supporting cast (well... the serial killer isn't that great...), though a certain scene where she emotionally tells her story to Cross is way forced.There are times, however, when great acting just can't make up for a mechanical script. It's not that the plot is bad itself, it's that it's exposed somewhat mundanely. It seems as though whenever a plot point is determined by the characters, they dwell on it for a bit, until it becomes uninteresting, and then the next plot point is delivered to us. The method of delivery never seems to flow out of the film's preceding movement, and often defies common sense (why would a psychologist be able to pick up a medical reference and easily pick out the drug used on a victim, when the actual medical doctors could not? it's possible but seems a bit too convenient).The film's handling of the script is good. It looks good, and sounds good (in 5.1 surround). I still couldn't help but notice that all the tricks one normally sees that are supposed to increase tension and drama are used in this film, too, even when the script just doesn't provide the same tension and drama. (For instance, when Freeman makes a solemn pronouncement about some trait of the killer he randomly decided on, because he's so good.) When this happens, it feels like the movie is going through the motions (no matter how hard it tries, it's just not as hard-hitting or dark as, say, Se7en). Often enough, though, the cinematographer's and director's work fits the screenplay perfectly, especially during the action at the end. The experienced movie goer, however, will probably detect a moment of randomness (watch the camera work during the bar scene with the three detectives, after Jeremy Piven asks Ashley Judd to stay still) -- I'm probably nitpicking here.Well, there you go. It's a good movie, but quite cliched, and too often it just doesn't feel right. But if you use it to admire Morgan Freeman's work, you will be entertained. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd","Date":"11 August 2005","Score":"46 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" This suspense thriller is every bit as good as James Patterson's fine novel and has great chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The sole plot is Freeman's search for two serial kidnappers and killers who snatch beautiful and accomplished young women, including Freeman's niece. The two killers try to outdo each other as they seize and destroy their trophy captives. As with most mysteries, this one has the usual red herrings, false leads and dead ends. Freeman is excellent as Alex Cross and heroine Judd is a study in grit and survival and is very effective in a finely nuanced role. The supporting cast is also great in a movie that has a leisurely pace and several great action scenes as it peaks towards its conclusion. The North Carolina location lensing, music score and cinematography are all very good. "},{"Title":"Thrilling mystery.

The movie also picks some not so likely approaches with each story sometimes, which goes at the expensive of the credibility- and therefore also the tension of the movie.It's a movie that had the potential of becoming a real dark and eerie thriller, I mean the concept of the movie would definitely allow this but the movie gets somewhere stuck between its successful and not so successful thriller moments.Guess Morgan Freeman wanted to make another Se7en like thriller. Well, it's not completely fair to compare this movie to Se7en but because Morgan Freeman is in it and it's from about the same period, it's easy and tempting to do so. Also with some imagination the plots and approaches of both movies show some similarities. But unfortunately Kiss the Girls is nowhere in the same league as Se7en but fans of the genre will still find plenty to enjoy in this movie.The movie features all of the right required thriller ingredients. So a psychopath, a cop trying to solve the case and of course a couple of plot twists. It also has all the right looks for a thriller.

What's the old saying? He would be interesting reciting the phone book. Freeman has the kind of screen presence that other actors only dream of possessing. He is calm, reassuring, magnetic... he is wise without acting like a know-it-all; maturity and decency seem to radiate from him. It's interesting to ponder whether Freeman is really that good of an actor, or if he simply possesses an overdose of charisma, like Errol Flynn. In any event, he's the best thing about 'Kiss The Girls', a standard-issue sicko-on-the-loose-kidnapping-beautiful-women thriller. It's basically a rehash of 'Silence of the Lambs' without the Hannibal Lecter character. And without the style. Much is hinted at and some of the dialogue is explicit, but that's as far as 'Kiss The Girls' goes. Visually, it's really pretty dull. Good thing it has Morgan Freeman to aim the camera at. Ashley Judd plays the one who gets away, a kidnap victim who escapes the psycho's dungeon. (And it is literally a dungeon. No basement or shed. A real dungeon.) She is also a brilliant doctor. See, this sick creep likes to kidnap INTELLIGENT and INDEPENDENT women. No airheads for him. Unfortunately, this little twist in the usual plot provides no new ideas or fresh situations, unless you count Freeman's daughter playing the violin. Judd is adequate in the not-very-believable role; she strikes me as a female Keanu Reeves, something sort of android-ish about her. And good old Cary Elwes (warning- spoiler coming) is- surprise!- the psychotic kidnapper. Like we were going to believe he was a sincere, good old boy policeman. Poor Cary Elwes- he is really typecast. But I can see why. He just has that kind of face. 'Kiss The Girls' seems a lot like your typical TV-movie of the week; it's what the critics call an 'agreeable time-filler'... but it DOES have Morgan Freeman in it.

After reading the novel, I was surprised by Freemans casting. He impressed me with his comittment to the character, however, during the film he seemed over-dramatic taking away from the realism of the story (what makes the film and novel so terrorizing). Ashley Judd played Kate McTieran well and portrayed Pattersons heroine with the courage and bravery expected. Where the movie falls short is in the script. The adaptation leaves out numerous key elements to the story. What makes the plot so riveting is the psychological trauma Cassanova and the Gentleman caller force onto their captives. With brief scenes portraying the womens captivity, they film takes away from the character development of the murderers and focuses too heavily on superfluous tidbits not necessary to the story. If you are seeking a true thriller, you may want to choose another movie. Although the film is entertaining and the acting decent, the novel is much better and the thriller genre is better utilized in other films.

C., police psychologist disappears from her campus in North Carolina. The psychologist (Freeman) goes down to help out the local cops. Shortly, another young woman (Judd), an intern at the local Regional Center is likewise kidnapped. We follow her story as she is taken to an underground dungeon, drugged and bound and raped. She escapes. Judd and Freeman join forces. They match the local kidnappings, which sometimes end in murder, with others that seem to follow the same pattern in California. They fly to California and discover that a cosmetic surgeon who lives in Marina Del Ray (all L.A. doctors live in Marina Del Ray) has ordered a huge supply of the rarely used drug that was used on Judd during her captivity.If you find this a little confusing, wait until you see the movie. The plot is not simply complicated, but riddled with lacunae. Unless I blinked at the wrong moment, the movie doesn't explain the relationship between the East Coast killer and the West Coast killer who is duplicating him. I also have no idea how the Eastern killer got hold of the same drug that the West Coast killer is using. And I don't understand why, just before they fly to L.A., Freeman rejects Judd's suggestion that they notify the F.B.I. It's impossible for anyone to know why, after Judd escapes from the killer's hideaway, she stumbles through perhaps 100 yard of forest then jumps into the river, and yet the police and the FBI still can't find the obvious superterranian entrance to the killer's lair. I mean, why couldn't they figure out that it must be located along a two or three miles stretch of the river, less than 100 yeard from the left bank? Why do they refer to benzodiazepines as benzos when docs call them diazepines? I don't know why the killers off some of the girls and preserve others. The first girl who is offed is Heidi Schanz. The killer deserves to be strung up by his Buster Browns for that. I don't care how many rules she's broken. No additional clarity is provided by the director, who seems to have found out that a camera can be hand held. And the editing introduces further murk. Quick cuts of Ashley Judd practicing her kick boxing in the dungeon, with an occasional brief shot of her doing nothing in particular. Irrelevant tanker trucks that zoom suddenly out of nowhere and almost run Freeman down at a tense moment.Why go on? Some people will undoubtedly like it because watching it will be comforting. Like all rituals watching a variation on the serial killer theme may provide a fixed point in a changing and disappointing universe. Well, a chaque a son gout. I don't know how many times I've heard Stan Getz's solos with Woody Herman's band, but I could listen to them a hundred more times. Speaking of music, somebody plays a sprightly jig from a suite by Bach and later another piece. The first is really difficult. The violinist deserves a medal for introducing some unexpectedly fresh airs into an otherwise stale production.A shame, too, because the leads are both imposing performers in their different ways.

As a series of young women are kidnapped in the area around Durham, North Carolina, Cross is drawn into the case when his own niece falls prey to the kidnapper. Only a couple of bodies have been found, leading Cross to believe that those killed are being punished for some reason, and that the kidnapper is actually collecting women as trophies and keeping them alive for some unknown reason.

It's her ordeal that we basically follow, through to her desperate escape and then her involvement with Cross in trying to track down the man responsible. This becomes a truly taut thriller - very exciting, and with a real sense of suspense about exactly how this is going to be resolved. A mystery is introduced when evidence seems to point to the possibility that the kidnapper is working not only in North Carolina, but also in California, because there have been a number of similar disappearances there.Freeman and Judd were very good in these roles. Both captured their characters almost from the start and both were totally believable. I felt that almost too much was introduced near the end of this, with the result being that I found myself confused by exactly what was happening. Perhaps that's appropriate for this kind of movie, but the confusion seemed almost too much, although eventually everything came back together, and there's a good finish to the story.

Though as commercial and formula-driven as it is, the movie's not a rehash but a fertile piece, based on a Patterson book about a criminal who, the Freeman character perceives, is not killing his quarries, but accumulating them. Often said by moviegoers to be the actor whose presence has the most authority of any of his generation, Freeman has an exceptional bearing on the screen, a particular determination that we believe. He never looks or sound like he's pretending. He never gives a superficial, obvious or distracted impression, and even in movies that aren't that good, he's not guilty by association You feel he's genuine even as a film may capsize around him.Freeman plays Patterson's pet character Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist with the Washington, D.C., police, who becomes entrenched in a chain of kidnappings in North Carolina. When his own niece is taken, he flies there and calls on the police department, where he's kept waiting for hours until he ultimately barges into the office of the chief. The victims are being taken by a man who inscribes himself Casanova, and one of his victims is found dead tied to a tree and left for the critters to find. Cross questions why there aren't more bodies, and speculates that Casanova is a collector who kills only when he believes he needs to. His niece and her fellow captives must still be alive somewhere. His hypothesis is certified by what comes of extraordinarily sexy local doctor Ashley Judd, who also gives the sometimes humdrum drama a helping of forceful energy.And what Freeman brings to all of his scenes is a really specific thoughtfulness. He doesn't just listen, he appears to cogitate what he is told, to gauge it. That masterful attribute begets a funny outcome, when other actors will tell him something and then stop to see if he trusts it. And Judd shows us such a boldly defined personality, which makes their dialogue scenes, after she's been developed for awhile, engrossing.Kiss the Girls was directed by Gary Fleder, whose first feature, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, boasted skill but too much artifice. Here he's more careful and restrained, with a story where the shades and details are as chilling as anything else. Here as in Seven, we get a steady feeling of not being able to see everything we believe we want to, as in a chase through the woods which Fleder makes effectively tense through its efficient use of space, never revealing the distance between victim and pursuer.When the film is over and we know all of its enigmas, there's one we'd like to know more about What precisely are particulars of the histrionics between the two most nefarious characters? But being left with such a wringer is much more fulfilling in a way than being given the explanation in the conventional fast-sketch Freudian description. What we're also left with is the genuine feeling of having met two authentically defined people in the leads. Freeman and Judd are so good, you almost wish they'd chosen not to make a thriller at all, had just discovered a way to create a drama really sinking their teeth into their characterizations. All things considered, I would've preferred that movie.

The villain is a creepy psychopath, a serial rapist and a killer who kidnaps young women and is then deluded enough to think that he can win their affection. An eerie atmosphere prevails throughout and some interesting characters, tense moments and unexpected developments ensure that the action remains thoroughly engrossing right through to the movie's gripping climax.Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is a Washington D.C. police detective and forensic psychologist who travels to Durham, North Carolina when his niece, Naomi (Gina Ravera), becomes the latest in a series of young women who have recently disappeared. He soon discovers that the missing women have all been kidnapped by a man who calls himself Casanova and one of his captives has been killed and left in a forest tied up to a tree. Cross is relieved to discover that the murder victim isn't his niece but very soon after, a local young doctor called Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is also kidnapped from her home.Cross is a cool and methodical character who, after studying the available information, comes to the conclusion that Casanova is actually a collector rather than a serial killer and is probably only murdering the women who persist in disobeying his orders.Kate McTiernan is a feisty person whose pastimes include kick-boxing. She's initially kept in a drugged state by her captor and when she recovers consciousness, finds herself in an underground cell where she can hear the voices of the other unseen captives. Shortly after, she manages to make her escape when she bravely jumps from a very high cliff and has to be rescued from the river below before having to spend some time recuperating in hospital. When her recovery is complete, Kate and Cross decide to work together to hunt down Casanova. Despite the useful information that Kate is able to contribute to the investigation, their task becomes more complicated when some new clues unexpectedly point them in the direction of Los Angeles.Kiss The Girls is well-made, visually impressive and has a consistent sense of impending danger. The dialogue is good and occasionally amusing, for example when the unhelpful Durham Police Chief tells Cross to make yourself at home but don't mess around in the kitchen. It also has a very talented cast and two lead performances which are excellent both individually and in the way that they complement each other. Morgan Freeman is faultless as the intelligent investigator and Ashley Judd conveys her character's combination of courage and vulnerability very convincingly.

There was not really anything overly innovating here or anything that made you go 'whoa, that was impressive'. And the movie is suffering under this.The story is your average story about a serial killer who kidnaps people, and then one man decides to track him down as he is closely tied to one of the kidnapped girls.Right, nothing that hasn't been done or seen before in other movies.However, I will say that Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes and Tony Goldwyn really performed quite well, and they managed to make Kiss the Girls watchable. There was also a bunch of other familiar faces to be seen throughout the movie, and that did spice it up a bit.But this movie didn't really rock my boat, and I have to settle on a very mediocre five out of ten stars for this crime mystery movie. The reason for this is that it was so predictable, generic and offered no surprises throughout the almost two hours that is runs. There are far better crime mystery movies available, and this one follows the 'how-to-make-a-crime-mystery' guidebook without any deviation.

A furious chase ensues, and many dark secrets are revealed.This was certainly an interesting movie, no doubt. It looked a bit like the movie Se7en (1995) when I first heard of it, but when I got into it...it took a very large amount of interest from the movie Silence of the Lambs (1991), and the entire Hannibal Lector trilogy for that matter. Almost to the point of being a ripoff, sadly. The plot structure is the same, very reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter throughout the movie, and the idea of a sick psychopath kidnapping young girls seems to be loosely tied to the excellent Silence of the Lambs. OK, so you get the idea...this movie is a lot like the Hannibal Lector trilogy, but more...restrained. Not as dark, psychotic, or grisly as Silence of the Lambs and lacking the brutality and, thankfully, the idiocy, of Hannibal, this one seems almost like a leftover script from the writers/directors of the Hannibal trilogy.Not to say it sucks, though, it's the opposite. This movie is very intelligent and sickening at some points (though not to the levels of the Hannibal trilogy, of course). It's got a solid plot and is actually very frightening at times. The characters are good and the acting is especially well-preformed by all of our lead cast members. It drags on for a long time (2 hours), but that's a good thing here...see, I didn't want it to end, it had me glued to my seat for most of it's duration. The plot twist at the end was very good and I did not see it coming. Too bad the ending was a ripoff of the ending of Hannibal or Manhunter; perhaps an amalgamation of the two. Bleh.Overall this is definitely worth a rental. It's a solid movie with a good cast and a thoroughly interesting plot. Just...rent the Hannibal trilogy first.

I was disappointed that some of the relationships within the original story that make the book such a good read are sadly neglected in the movie. I refer to Cross's relationships with Nana, with his children, and most of all with his cop partner John Sampson. All of these help build Cross into a three dimensional character in Patterson's novels, as well as introducing us to these three dimensional characters themselves. The characters are nothing more than peripheral in the movie, and I think this was an opportunity missed to give the film more depth. Morgan Freeman, being Morgan Freeman, did a predictably awesome job in carrying the movie in his usual understated authoritative manner, but it was a shame other characters (and actors) weren't given more opportunity to share the workload. Other than that, a pretty good job and easily watchable.

I was kept on the edge of my seat and kept interested in finding out who the killer was. There were a couple of times where I felt the scene could move a little faster but I wasn't bored. Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd were great in this film but they never disappoint. I'm a Cary Elwes fan and he was pretty good in this film, but I don't know what was up with that accent of his. It is never a good thing when a Londoner tries to speak with a southern accent. It's not a good combination. But that didn't distract me from the film or make me want to turn it off. I kept watching! But the most entertaining film in the scene was the climax. It was interesting how Morgan Freeman realized who the kidnapper was and then I was so enthralled with finding out how he was going to get to Ashley Judd before something bad happened to her. I was a little disappointed that Jeremy Piven, who played Henry Castillo, LAPD, had such a little role. He is such a great actor and he doesn't show up until halfway through the film and he's in, like, three scenes and then his character is killed. That makes me wonder why he was even in this film but he was good nonetheless. He never disappoints. This film was gripping and interesting and never boring. It won't win any awards or make any kind of difference in any of the actor's careers but it was a good film. I enjoyed it and I'm glad I have it in my collection.

It's a gruesome world; one that I, and many other people, would not want to be a part of.With Cross' niece being one of these victims, you can't help but feel compassion and sympathy for him.

Having said that, I'm glad they didn't play up the romance between Cross and McTiernan- time constraint and age gap.However, try and think of this as a film in no way linked to Se7en (this will be difficult as critics have already hammered home comparisons) and you will be pleasantly surprised. It has its share of thrills, and Freeman and Judd are excellent, with a small role for the always welcome Jeremy Piven. With the following Along Came a Spider, which is also very good, the Dr. Alex Cross franchise may take off yet.

A crook as smart as he was surely would not have done such a dumb deed.  However, it was necessary for the script. And finally, during the last scene, the gas connector behind the stove had a shut-off valve that Freeman could have turned when he first arrived on the scene, eliminating the resultant explosion threat . However, that would have made the ending much less exciting.  I rate it 7 of 10, because it is very well done, and entertaining to watch.

I can't honestly say that it was completely terrible, but it definitely wasn't worth the time lost, and it wasn't all that original either--just a jumble of stuff that mostly seems to have been used before with, admittedly, a few new elements. There are plot holes left and right, and the cops and FBI all seem to be pretty incompetent (God, I hope I don't ever have to depend on this quality of law enforcement). The mild torture porn scenes were so intentionally aimed at titillation that they were basically just annoying. No performances, including Freeman's, were particularly captivating, although none embarrassingly bad either. Uninspired would be the best way to describe this whole experience. I have to admit that I didn't know who was the killer until it was revealed, but when it was, it was totally unconvincing. A day later, it's even more unconvincing. The reason you can't guess the identity of the evil mastermind is that it doesn't really work well with the story at all--the motive and personality never seemed like it was ever there. That particular character was never developed much at all in the movie. It looks like the story writers (Patterson doesn't write most of his own work, as I understand it) picked the villain simply because it would be very hard to guess, and for no other reason. (Maybe the book was better, but in this case I seriously doubt it, and the book would waste more of your life.) Therefore, as far as who did it, I don't feel thick at all for not having a clue.

Although Freeman might be older than the Alex Cross from the novels he is believable although he seems to end up in charge of the case very easily when he was supposed to be a guest in another police force and told not to mess around in the kitchen.Also Cross does not believe in calling police back up which means suspects evade capture leading to a contrived showdown. Also it makes you wander if the girls in the hidden lair are well fed and looked after, which means the villain has to regularly turn up with food and provisions that would leave tyre tracks and the like meaning the lair is not so well hidden. Such flaws in the plot and some bad lines let the film down.

Instead, this lukewarm, pretentious drivel that is an absolute letdown. Okay, the book is gruesome, cruel, vicious, everything dark and menacing, and it is the absolute opposite of family-friendly and politically correct, but if that is what you want, go see a Walt Disney movie. Instead, just like American PSYCHO, the movie is a tepid mess compared to what it could have been.I'd have suggested pegging it down a notch or two for the silver screen, but they brought it all the way down to virtually nothing shocking at all. That first scene with the girl being led through the deep woods had the absolute feel of the book to it, but cut away to the aftermath crime scene too quickly. Read that particular 'juggling' scene in the book, and understand what should at the very least have been there. How can I put it lightly for those with tender sensibilities, and who then shouldn't be at this movie's screening in the first place? Psychologists would call it rejection, but as a way of a final bit of abuse, the killer availed himself to juggling the girl's bare breasts before murdering her. She cried and pleaded all the time. I full well realize the cinema industry would have balked at that sort of thing, but much of it could have been off- camera, as long as this defining scene that absolutely needed to be there, wasn't omitted entirely. But film-makers were keen to cash in on the success of the novel without being willing to commit something at least a whole lot more heinous to film.Need we talk about the snake? This would have been way over the top for almost all audiences, but again, the graphic detail need not have been shown. I don't think I am at liberty to discuss this any further on a politically-correct family site, so just read the book, and prepare to enter a nightmare.If you don't wanna walk the walk, film something else. Leave a thrilling, suspenseful read alone, you are discrediting it.

The kidnapped Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) fortunately escapes, meets Cross, and help him in attempts to locate his niece and the hostages.This is a good conventional thriller, full of mystery, twists and turns and some kick-butt action that will surely captivate an audience and keep them engaged. Morgan Freeman makes a calm, serious and thoughtful Alex Cross, providing some touching drama and good on-screen chemistry with Judd's McTiernan character. Judd, though, was somewhat emotionless and detached from her role in some scenes, in my opinion. David Klass did a good job in writing the screenplay, adapting from James Patterson's novel, making a movie where the story is fresh and intriguing. Gary Fleder's solid direction helped with the plot's suspenseful pacing and generated enough tension to keep the movie attention-grabbing; I especially liked the part where McTiernan attempts to escape from the kidnapper in a heart-pumping game of cat and mouse.

Freeman plays a detective who is also a psychologist.His skill at talking down a suicidal killer is displayed at the onset of the film. He finds out that his niece (Ravera) has been declared missing, so he flies into North Carolina to aid in the search where he discovers that she is only the latest in a series of missing college coeds. Meanwhile, three of the girls have been found dead, mutilated, and tied to trees. Then pretty intern Judd is snatched and taken to an underground series of cavernous rooms. When Judd does the impossible and escapes from the creepy kidnapper, she teams with Freeman to locate the guy and recover Ravera and the remaining girls before he kills them. The duo enlists the aid of various police officers and friends to sniff out the maniac (who introduces himself to his victims as Casanova) and prevent him from continuing his sick routine. There is a lot of visual style to this film and it does create and atmosphere of dread and discomfort as intended. However, what may have worked in book form does not translate very sensibly to film. Freeman (an actor who effortlessly exudes cool and intellect in nearly any role) comes off as SuperDetective, a man who can put together things in an instant that a whole team of cops can't. Any hunch he has is right and he is the only one who can even begin to figure out the killer. Judd is attractive and lively in the film (and at one point wears some startlingly realistic eye prosthetics to demonstrate her difficulty in escaping through the dense woods) but her headstrong character can also be seen as foolish at times. The biggest problem with the film, though, is the contrivance of the storyline and the credibility-straining aspects of the identity of the killer. Although the film is creepy and interesting, and at times unsettling, it makes very little sense when it's all over. (No one had any idea about the underground rooms except a college kid? Judd escapes right near a waterfall. Couldn't that be used as a guidepost in the search? These and many other questions abound.) The audience is never given any sort of explanation for the killer's behavior and the identity of the killer is both predictable and laughable at the same time. The climax of the film is especially weak. It is highly unlikely that Judd, living in a two-story house, only has one phone extension (and check out the number of carrots she's chopping for dinner for two! Is she improving her night vision or what??) By the time the pat, clichéd ending arrives, the story has lost most of its already tenuous logic. Still, on a strictly gut-level, there are moments of excitement and suspense, aided immensely by the professionalism of the lead actors.

As wisely surmised by Freeman, the serial killer is really a collector of beautiful women &#x96; he keeps them as sex slaves in an underground cavern...Kiss the Girls starts out with an intriguing story, taken from the successful novel by James Patterson.

There are too many moments when you ask, How the heck did that happen? as characters often appear trapped in their own awkward actions. The inability of authorities to discover the villain's lair due to acrobatic amnesia given beautiful Ashley Judd (as Kate McTiernan) is one example. At another point, one vulnerable character asks someone we know is sinister to hand her a big chopping knife to cut some little carrots. The next two lines could have been, What big teeth you have! and The better to eat you with, my dear!...The fascinating duality of the villain doesn't double the terror like it should. There are a few allusions, but we don't see the truly evil actions being described &#x96; the direction is more mildly erotic than horrific or suspenseful. Although it would be departing from the original work, it might have been nice to see more of a partnership between Freeman's detective helpers Cary Elwes (as Nick Ruskin) and Alex McArthur (as Davey Sikes). There is a glimpse of Mr. McArthur in a car near the end which makes you wonder if another tryst was possible. Yet, this brief shot of the McArthur becomes another What the heck did that mean? moment. Still, Freeman and the others perform skillfully, as does the production crew.***** Kiss the Girls (9/10/97) Gary Fleder ~ Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Cary Elwes, Tony Goldwyn "},{"Title":"Sort of Shallow Considering","Date":"25 August 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Embracing the right Atmosphere, this is a slightly better than Average Serial Killer Movie that loses some attempted perversity with its lack of exploration into the Misfit Mind of these Human Anomalies.

But here little time is spent on Personality or Character Demystification.It is sacrificed for uninteresting Police Procedures and Crime Scenes and Thriller Movie Clichés. The two Leads, as always, deliver credibility to their Roles, but as sincere and gifted as Ashley Judd may be, this may be a slight bit of Miscasting. Morgan Freeman is fine as the Black Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross, from the Novels.Technically, as Cross points out, this is not a Serial Killer in the (im)purist sense. He is a Collector who Kills only when his Living Dolls misbehave. Then he unfeelingly disposes of them like so many Chatty Cathy's. In the end, it is worth a view, but is not very well thought out and the Script lets the whole thing feel a lot less intelligent than the Characters, on both sides of the Law deserve.

There's a serial killer on the loose, but not all of the missing girls are dead. Cross joins the investigation. One of the victims, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Judd) manages to escape, though injured. Though she never saw the man, who wore a mask, she's able to help. Soon, however, the trail leads also to California. Are there two serial killers? Is there one bicoastal killer? Or are they partners? Kiss the Girls is plenty scary in spots, a less benign Phantom of the Opera, if you will, dealing as it does with a killer who collects strong, attractive, and exceptional women. He has Cross' niece playing the violin. And there are some grand guignol aspects.The acting is truly excellent. Judd gives a forceful performance as a tough, brave and resourceful medical intern. Freeman is great - he repeats this role in the less successful (in my opinion) Along Came a Spider. Cary Elwes and Tony Goldwyn give good support.I have two main criticisms.

The second thing is, when Cross realizes there's a problem (not to give anything away) and rushes out, why doesn't he also call the police to see if anyone is closer to the scene? Still, very good.

Much better than more recent films I've seen, such as The Alphabet Killer. This one delivers real suspense and a sense of mystery, leaving the viewer guessing who the killer is.Now, as good as it is, it's important to say that it also has its flaws. I think the plot gets a bit convoluted later on in the film. I think the idea of having a kidnapped niece -- of all the women in the world -- is far-fetched. And the film doesn't compare to similar films of the 1990s. It is by no means as good as the classic Silence of the Lambs and even Morgan Freeman, as great as he is, doesn't present himself as the most awesome detective he possibly can -- that would be in Seven.That's really what it comes down to. Watch Seven and Silence of the Lambs, both excellent, well-crafted serial killer films. If you like those and crave more, then consider checking out Kiss the Girls.

I'm assuming that the novel fleshed out the character a lot more so that it was actually a surprise, or at least interesting, and it's a shame that the film couldn't have kept that. Either way it's only a slight distraction in a film that overall is very compelling. Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd both deliver good performances; not their best work, but it's far from their worst.

Before watching it I had made an assumption that it was a bad movie - how wrong wasn't I? Silly me.Morgan Freeman is a police/doctor and is caught up in a case concerning a psychopath after his nice is kidnapped. The kidnapper proves to be some kind of casanova character and is kidnapping woman not to murder them but to prove to them that they love him.The case proves to be very difficult to solve and it is not until a girl manages to escape that a possible route is discovered - much thanks to Freemans non-traditional police job. What follows is a thrilling search for solutions and the viewer is presented with bits and glimpses that continually leads him or her into a wrong track - thereby saving the true solutions to the last 20 minutes of the movie.The suspense is high and as a viewer you get just the right amount of clues to make sure you stays in front of the screen trying to solve the case before Freeman does but constantly failing in that. The movie never becomes boring and the end isn't given away to early. Freeman again proves that he is a master in acting but also Judd and Elves gives splendid performances - the later being an actor that I always thought has had to few serious parts and has been in the shadow for too long.I recommend this movie to all those that loves a thrill. I never loses itself in unwanted blood and gore which is good. The suspense isn't in body-counts but in riddles and lack of answers.

Probably for no other reason than both films share the talent and respectability of Morgan Freeman. Now while Seven was all around great film, Kiss The Girls gets by on Morgan Freeman more than it should have to. The premise seems solid enough at first. Cross (Freeman) gets involved in a search for a man who continues to kidnap young women after it gets personal and the kidnapper takes his niece. What follows from there you can probably partly pick up upon and hence the problem. The movie can't avoid the pitfall of typical killer motifs and clichés of these types of films.Perhaps comparing this film in any light to Seven is unfair, but Seven never got sloppy. There are a few times during Kiss The Girls where things get a little too comfy for their own good and good actors have to save desperate scenery. How many red herrings are enough? How many times do we have to have one of those slow winding end confrontational scenes where the main characters put 2 & 2 together coming to the rushed realization and whatnot?It's when the movie is over that you will most notice these things. During the actual running time, the whole thing moves well enough as we follow Cross as he ventures down possible leads and as we continue to get inside glimpses of the kidnapper referred to as Casanova. Ashley Judd costarring as the victim aptly named the one that got away gives some juice to the conventional plot. Unfortunately given time to think about the movie as a whole drops it's sights a notch. Freeman is great as usual, Judd holds her own, but the material falters at times making my viewing experience just above average at best.

Sanders, and Jeremy Piven Director Gary Fleder   111 minutes   Rated R (for terror/violence, themes regarding rape and other inappropriate sexual behavior, language, and brief nudity)By Blake FrenchKiss The Girls is the kind of movie that starts out quite deep, but the more it progresses, the more we discover the material's lack of depth, only leaving the plot to stumble about half way though truing what could have been the next The Usual Suspects, into only a so-so, typical, moody serial killer production.The filmmakers have cast Morgan Freeman as police detective Alex Cross, who is hot on the track of a serial killer who snatches strong willed young women and keeps them in his yet-to-be-found lair to be tortured and raped at his will. He calls himself Casanova, and wares a bizarre looking mask on his face blocking any traces of his identity. Recently, this madman has captured Cross' niece, making this one case of personal will.Early in the film, we learn of a woman named Kate Mctiernan, a kick-boxing, strong willed, independent woman who is taken from inside her own walls one night by Casanova in a disturbing and terrifying scene. This character allows us to experience the grip and fortress of Casanova through her point of view. He tells her in his dark, cave-like dungeon that he loves her dearly, and orders her not to break any of his set rules. Once a captive for a day, she leans of the other kidnapped women also present, and realizes that it is all up to her to save these people by escaping. Therefore, in a detailed and convincing sequence, Kate confronts the angry Casanova and returns his hatred with a fight that gives her the upper hand on him, and like a blind cat in New York, she stumbles out of the maze-like territory and reaches daylight, only leading her to a near dearth experience in the process. Alex Cross interviews Kate after her delicate recovery. She explains all she knows to him, and also demands that she is allowed to participate in the bust of Casanova. Their first lead is a man named Will Rudolph, who (spoiler) only turns out to be an apprentice of Casanova and escapes the wrath of the police during his arrest and heads back to his leader. After that, even more assistants of Casanova are discovered, a rapist who has sex with, but never hurts, any of his victims.The film offers good performances throughout the cast--especially by Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. Both characters are developed with a state of personal willingness and precise reason. Their motives are understood. In result, the audience feels great empathy for them. The villain is developed with a personality and revilement similar to the Keyser Sose character in 1994's The Usual Suspects--one of the greatest villains in film history. He is first shown through peoples' descriptions and rumors, then through dark, foggy shadows with a deep, bellowing voice, which is first heard in the tantalizing opening credits. Unfortunately, the movie takes a turn for the worst about half way though when it takes on side characters who have no purpose in the plot to distract the audience for whatever reason. The mystery loses its much tension, and the film is all down hill from there-even the somewhat predictable final twist isn't nearly as effective as it could have been due to this blemish.Even after the movie's almost fatal second act flaw, however, it still offers scenes of suspense that work well, a villain that is well developed, an atmosphere which is occasionally spectacular and performances that are convincing and intriguing. I recommend the film, but with hesitation that did not have to be there if not for the writers who literally went out of their way to throw in a major problem that took this film from being great-to only being satisfactory lever.

This is probably the kind of dark, brooding, ominous film which self-styled media critics (themselves members of the media) would like to blame the mass murders of Columbine and the shootings in Georgia and California on - although it's not nearly so psychedelic and mind-altering as Natural Born Killers.  Still this film's portrayal of the psychotic terror that lurks within ALL of us is both compelling and frightening.  Freeman seems to have a niche with these sort of films, and I predict in 20 years his name and work will have assumed that of a cult status.  This movie is not for young children, and probably not for most adults either - but if you're a fan of the kind of mindf**k that films such as The Blair Witch Project provide you'll thoroughly enjoy this film. The intelligent will walk away knowing that this experience was not an instructional cookbook for mayhem but rather the portrayal of the same kind of quiet madness that stalks us in the form of Aryan Nation activists and Anti-Semites every day.

It gets back to Washington that the niece of D.C PD Dr. Alex Cross, Morgan Freeman, Naomi, Gina Ravera, is missing and possibly kidnapped by the killer and has Dr. Cross shoot down to Durham to not only find Naomi but solve the crimes and catch the perpetrator. Alex Cross is a man not to be taken lightly by the local Durham PD or anyone else for that matter. He's a Inspector Doctor (PHD) of criminology in the police department of a major US city, Washington D.C. Cross is also a well known and top selling author of books about crime and a famous Forensic Psychologist who's wrote scores of collage papers on the workings of the criminal mind. On top of all that Dr. Cross has a degree in Pharmacology, the science of drugs and the effects that they have on those who use them.The police find one of the missing girls dead in the woods tied to a tree but happily for Dr. Cross she's not his niece Naomi. As all the leads are being checked out by the police Dr. Kate McTiernan, Ashely Judd, who works in the Durham General Hospital. Kate gets kidnapped by the killer and is drugged and put in a cell underground in the woods that used to be the basement of an old southern plantation. We learn from Kate, after her rescue, that the killer who calls himself Casanova, because he thinks that he's the world's greatest lover, likes to get beautiful as well as strong willed and psychically active young women and then break them down mentally and turn them into a bunch of obedient and helpless sex-slave zombies who will do anything he wants them to.Kate fakes being drugged and kicks and boxes her way out of the cell that Casanova locked her into and then running through the woods she jumps down a waterfall and escapes from the pursuing Romeo. In the hospital Dr. Cross concludes that Kate was under the influence of a powerful knock-out drug called Sistol which doesn't show up in a persons blood and urine. Checking out the sale of Sistol Cross finds out that a curtain Doc. William Randolph, Tony Goldwyn, an L.A plastic surgeon who comes from Durham ordered the largest supply of Sistol in the country and Sistol has nothing to do with plastic surgery. Dr. Cross and Kate fly to L.A with D.C Det. Sampson, Bill Nunn. Dr. Cross meets with local L.A police detective Henry Costillo, Jerry Piven, as they plan to catch Randolph in the act and arrest him. The plan backfires when outside his house they hear a girl scream and as they stormed the house Randolph killed Det. Costello and ran over Cross who tried to stop him from getting away. Going to Randolph's house in L.A Dr. Cross and the L.A police find a large supply of Sistol. They also find a 20 year-old newspaper clipping with a photo of Dr. Wick Sachs, William Converse-Roberts, who teaches at Durham Collage. Cross figures out by putting all the evidence together that Randolph is working together with both Dr. Sachs and Casanova back east in the kidnap murders in and around Durham. It turns out that Dr. Sachs was used by Casanova to get him beautiful girls with strong wills after he sampled them to find out if the girls fit Casanova's high standards of mind and body in the women that he's looking for.Dr. Sachs tells Dr. Cross that he sexually sampled as much as 100 women students in 75 different positions over the last four years including Cross' young niece Naomi. Dr. Sachs was so sick in his description of how he sampled the girls, especially Dr.Cross' niece, that the always cool and collective Cross lost it and almost put Dr.Sachs' head through a two-way mirror. Meanwhile back in the basement in the woods Randolph who escaped from the police in California and it turned out that he did worked with Casanova in doing all the legwork for him has it out with Casanova. complaining about how he does all the work and that he, Casanova, has all the fun partying with the girls and that he, Randolph, also wants to get a piece of the action too. it's during the argument with Randolph that Casanova takes a shot at him. Unknown to both Casanova and Randolph Dr. Cross is in the woods looking for the Civil War plantation. When he heard the shot Dr. Coss found where the kidnapped girls were hidden and came to their, as well as his niece Naomi's, rescue as both Casanova and Randolph fled. Cross guns down Randolph as he tries to escape in the woods but Casanova gets away. The ending of Kiss The Girls was as contrived as it can get with Casanova, who was so careful during the entire movie, for no reason at all exposing himself and ending up getting his brains blown out by Cross. This is all done with the help of a milk carton, you have to see for yourself, as Casanova tried to murder both Kate and Dr. Cross with his lighter, you'll have to see that for yourself too.The movie ' Kiss the Gils had a lot of potential at first but sadly fell completely apart with the story going in all different directions and all of them at the same time going absolutely nowhere.

Cross fails to secure any leads until his battle with the infamous abductor turns personal.

With no clue or leads for unmasking this elusive stalker, the police with the help from the doctor must find a clever way to unlocking his secrets. As time becomes of the essence and the night takes over, Cross and the doctor rush desperately to seek out the lost souls who are under duress into becoming the fiend's prisoners...KISS THE GIRLS is a perversely provocative thriller with such stunning photography. The moody atmosphere truly enraptures the viewer into a dark nightmarish world. The lightning is sometimes incomprehensible for the picture, but this fault adds to the disturbing effect of the movie itself.

Morgan Freeman establishes more integrity as a forensics psychologist, determined to track down his kidnapped niece. The main scoundrel, whoever his real name may be, is one of the most unique villains ever to embrace the screen.

Morgan Freeman plays the heroic detective who saves the day, while Ashley Judd is cast as one of the victims. Kiss the Girls represents the first of the big-screen cinematic adaptations of bestselling author James Patterson's novels. A first-class cast and polished production values cannot compensate for this generally routine thriller that features an unusual number of villains. The early scenes involving our heroine's incarceration and escape as well as a last minute rescue when our hero discovers who is helping the villains behind the scenes stand out. Everything else is basically a police procedural that Fleder doesn't orchestrate with more than the usual suspense and tension. The uneven quality of the film is seen in the Judd character who starts out as an active character but later degenerates into just another victim.Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is searching for his missing niece when a lady, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is abducted by a predator who calls himself Casanova. This wily fellow sneaks into her house and captures her. Casanova imprisons Kate in a cave in the woods along with several other missing women. One of these missing women is Naomi Cross (Gina Ravera of Soul Food) who has a talent for playing the violin. Kate is an intelligent physician who also practices kick boxing and those kick boxing skills enable her to break out. Miraculously, Kate manages to escape from the cave where the other women and she were held hostage. She plunges herself into a mountain waterfall and winds up in the hospital. Dr. Cross checks up on Kate and determines that she is still on a drug. The attending physician, Dr. Ruocco (Roma Maffia), purges the narcotic from her bloodstream and she holds a news conference from her hospital where she announces to the media that she and only she alone escaped without help from his prison. She cooperates with the authorities to track down the evil predator responsible for her abduction as well as the abductions of other women.Dr. Cross and Kate travel to Los Angeles where they experience a close encounter with a predator, Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn of Ghost), who eludes them. The authorities link Dr. Rudolph from the West Coast with another predator, Dr. Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts of Crazy in Alabama), who lives on the East Coast. When Cross interrogates him, Dr. Sachs mentions his niece and Cross assaults him and has to be restrained by the FBI. Later, Cross and Kate comb the North Carolina woods where she was found. About 90 minutes into the action, Cross stumbles onto the underground lair where the abducted women are being held. He kills Dr. Rudolph in a roadside shoot-out and rescues his niece. Just when Cross thinks that he has solved the case, he discovers a loose end and races off in his Porsche to save the damsel-in-distress. The cross-cutting between Cross careening across town in his sports car and Kate tangling with the villain in her kitchen caps off this literate but run-of-the-mill assailant. Nevertheless, the way that Cross takes out the killer with a milk carton is cool.Kiss the Girls is an okay thriller and Cary Elwes is good.

Ashley Judd plays the kidnap victim that manages to escape (something you already know if you have seen the previews or read the video box) but you have to sit through 30-40 minutes of her character being introduced, kidnapped, and then escaping before you get to where you already know the movie is going--her teaming up with Freeman to capture the killer. And I still don't understand how the Judd character can escape and be found (presumably) not to far from the stream she jumps into, yet no one can find the killer's compound until it's inevitably stumbled upon by our protagonists.  All we get is the throwaway line, nah, it's not there, they're already searched every inch of it, of course right before they indeed find it RIGHT THERE.Freeman and Judd are both fine actors, making this truly a waste of time and talent.  Rarely do I get so frustrated watching a movie.  But this is just unentertaining crap, avoid if at all possible.

The book, constantly had me on the edge, and constantly kept me guessing. The movie, however, failed to deliver on so many levels! The movie spent very little time in the dungeon for the watchers to really get acquainted with the situation. There was no real inherent danger, EVER. The use of Casanova's stun-gun was absent which, in the book, played a pivotal role. The opening scene of the book where Roe Tierny and Tom Hutchinson were murdered, was missing, the kidnap of Anna Miller and murder of her boyfriend, was missing. I could go on, it truly irritated me that pivotal points in the movie were foolishly discarded. The presence of rape was completely gone as well, now I understand the sensitive nature of the subject, but if a book is going to be turned into a movie, justice must be done! Bottom line, read the book, skip the movie!

By the third time, I disengaged completely. Numerous times in this so-called thriller, the good guys seeking the bad guys fail to call in back-up, place themselves unnecessarily in harm's way by failing to act--even when they have the upper hand--and as the plot twists continued, I felt I was being toyed with so that the film could go longer. I became impatient for the end, rather than interested in it. Even the final clue that gave Morgan Freeman the answer was embarrassingly obvious and available. Incidentally,Morgan Freeman is not the problem here, the screenplay itself is.

I thought parts of it were trying for suspense where there was none and parts of it were just cheezy. In a time when one of the best movies ever made dealt with a serial killer plot a movie like this can't stand up against that. Kiss the girls didn't contain much to make it a superior film. I'd rate it about a 4.5.

Dr. Alex Cross and Kate McTiernan try there best to find out the hiding place of a kidnapper, where this deranged man makes innocent young women his beck-and-call prisoners.  Actors Freeman and Judd would later reunite in another film, High Crimes (2002).  Their professional chemistry is worth a critical viewing... then, or now.

In my opinion this movie was very poor. Don't know what it was that made it so boring but it was just another attempt at a Thriller to rival Seven I think....... The 'Serial Killer' with the mask just did not do it for me and the way he kept coming back was straight out of a 'Fredy' movie or worse. It kept you on the edge of your seat, not because you wanted to know what was going to happen next but because you were shouting things at the screen like 'shut the cell door behind you stupid'......... I wonder why I am even making comments on this movie and wasting yet further time on it. Pay for some other movie, please.

First of all, for all the locations used to shoot this film, the result is that it could have been completely shot in Paramus, New Jersey.The camera is always so annoyingly close and suffocating that you don't know where you are. Also, there is way too much hand held camera movement, I felt I was watching a big budget Jess Franco movie.I was constantly reminded I was watching a movie with so much camera hijinks. Only brilliant directors can get away with so much movement, because they know what they are DOING. Directors like Scorsese use movement to enhance a feeling, they DON'T use it to show-off. Plot wise, the first killer is indentified within 40min. with a lame computer revelation scene. Gee, such sophisticated killers would allow themselves to be traced in a 60sec search (by the way, you can't trace a doctors medication purchases through a web site, even a FBI one at that.) Only the ending is clever and I'll give them credit for that, but it is wasted in this murky adaptation. An old pro should have directed this Friedkin, Lumet, Pollack; not some dopey MTV kid.

This one-trick pony of a movie really brings into sharp focus the problems which can be caused when one particular genre, whether it be in movies or books, becomes over-loaded.  James Patteron's books have always struck me as being a little less than complex, but with Kiss the Girls a real nadir is reached.  Without giving the game away, a film of nearly two hours with a thriller/serial killer plot needs more action than simply he kidnaps girls, one girl escapes, the cops know who he is, they catch him, shock - there's another killer on the loose, especially when the limited number of cast members makes it relatively easy to figure out who the other killer is.  Morgan Freeman struggles along gamely enough, but it's clear his heart's not in it. The rest of the cast simply struggle, with Brian Cox in particular completely wasted in the role of the crusty police chief.Gentlemen, if you want to copy Se7en, then at least do so properly or, even better, watch The Usual Suspects and see how it can be done.

It's a a film about a serial killer and a detective's attempt to track him down . Throughout the 1990s Hollywood had done this type of movie via SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , SEVEN and umpteen movies that I can't remember the names of . Not only that but British television produced an avanlance of TV shows along the same lines , programmes like SILENT WITNESS , CRACKER , TOUCHING EVIL , MESSIAH etcThe problem with this type of story is that it's entirely formulaic , people are murdered and a cop has to find out who it is before he kills again . Look at the films and television shows I've mentioned and they all share the same plot and to a lesser extent structure . Also in these type of stories there's often lapses in internal logic and with KISS THE GIRLS it involves a serial killer talking to a hostage wearing a mask . Why would he do this if he's going to kill the victim eventually ? That's because this particular victim is one of the main characters which you know nothing will happen to and in order to further the story the producers don't want to know who the killer is until the end hence the mask . To be fair this movie contains a very good stunt involving someone jumping into a waterfall and any movie starring Morgan Freeman is at least watchable due to the lead performance but I've seen this type of plot far too often to be enthralled "},{"Title":"Kiss the Girls","Date":"26 March 2007","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" I think the only reason I wanted to see this film was because of the main star, that is it! Basically many girls have been abducted by a kidnapper calling himself Casanova, the great lover. Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is the detective who is taking the case, not just because it is his speciality, but also his niece is one of the victims. The only way he can find this Casanova is with help of the only person who was kidnapped and escaped, Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd). Also starring Cary Elwes as Det. Nick Ruskin, Ghost's Tony Goldwyn as Dr. William 'Will' Rudolph, Sister Act's Bill Nunn as Det. John Sampson, Brian Cox as Chief Hatfield, Durham P.D. The unfortunate thing about this film is that it is too predictable, the only bits I found with some interest are Freeman talking to a woman with a gun she is pointing to her face, and Judd's escape in the woods and jumping off the cliff. Freeman returned his character in the I think much better Along Came a Spider. Worth watching! "}]
