[{"Title":"80's Heaven","Date":"23 October 2001","Score":"48 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  Anyone who wants to revisit the excesses of the 80's should definitely head straight for this movie.  Every element of it is strikingly evocative of its era.  It has all the obvious things like the absurd fashions, the brick-sized mobile phones, the casting (only in the 80's could a cast be assembled so wimpy that James Spader can convince as a tough guy!), and of course the drugs.  But it also has the little touches that generate shocks of recognition, from the pink and blue lighting, to the opening Bangles track, to the huge banks of TV screens masquerading as interior design it will rekindle memories you never knew you had.Like the central characters whom it both satirises and glorifies, this movie is beautiful to look at and obsessed with surface and appearance. You don't look happy, comments Clay (McCarthy) to Blair (Gertz) at one point, But do I look good? is her rejoinder.  This film, while not a happy one, definitely looks good.  Some scenes, notably one of McCarthy swimming and one of a swarm of motorcycles driving past him, seem to have no other purpose in the film beyond being aesthetically pleasing.  The film's visual imagery is indeed so striking that when the makers of The Simpsons wanted to include a parody musical Kickin' It - A Musical Journey Through the Betty Ford Clinic they drew the leading man (playing a celebrity busted for drug offences) dressed in the distinctive black and white suit worn by Robert Downey Jnr during the first party scene, presumably confident that it would be recognised.But despite its emphasis on visual style, Less Than Zero does have some substance underneath, most of it concentrated in Robert Downey Jnr's acute portrayal of the spoilt, self-destructive anti-hero Julian.  It is easy to say with hindsight that playing a drug-addled and desperate man was never going to be a huge stretch for Downey, and plenty of critics have done so. However, regardless of the reasons behind it's proficiency, his performance has a depth and range that gives it an air of authenticity rare in a genre of character which traditionally leads actors into either an excess of hamminess or a glazed vacancy.  Downey's Julian swings between easy-going charm, raw vulnerability, spoilt petulance and an aggressive unpredictability in a way which allows the audience to sympathise both with his family's angry hand-washing and his friend's reluctant love for him and determination to save him from himself.The role is a difficult juggling act and luckily Downey has the perfect foil in Spader's subtle turn as the cynically manipulative dealer, Rip.  The film really comes alive in the exchanges between the two, Julian puppy-ishly optimistic that he can sort his problems out and Rip cruelly cutting through his confidence to the reveal the self-deception at its heart, chipping away at Julian's fragile self-esteem in order to control him.Unfortunately, the film rather lets itself down with a closing few minutes that seem to drag on for at least an hour.  It's lazy, contrived and unlikely ending is more of a get out clause than a culmination and appears to have been written purely as a way of ending the film rather than as its logical conclusion.  Despite this fairly major flaw Less Than Zero is entertaining, with enough snappy dialogue, varied music and amusingly dressed extras to counteract its deficiencies.

From Eddie Nash's joint on Hollywood BlvdThe Seven Seas to Club Lingerie to the small venues in Long Beach and Orange County, this movie catches the ennui like a manic firefly in a jar. From the 'powder' in the ladies' room to casual sex, it shows it as it was--callow and shallow and a line/hit away from degradation and death.It's heart-breaking to watch Robert Downey Jr.'s character surrender his dignity to a free base pipe.  Other posts complain about the James Spader's performance, but he was dead on.  Pushers are not nice people.  This is an early cinematic example of truth about the nature of drug addiction.  Are you frightened? NOT FRIGHTENED ENOUGH!Scare yourself straight tonight.  Watch 'Drugstore Cowboy', 'Less than Zero', and 'Rush'.Here's hoping that Robert Downey Jr.'s talent will not be eclipsed by his addiction. He's an amazing actor. 'Chaplin' & 'Restoration' alone earned him a place in cinematic history.

Unfortunately this film was in production during the very height of the just say no to drugs Nancy Reagan campaign. I remember reading in the L.A. Times how the producers were stating that they changed the character Clay to an avid anti-drug crusading hero instead of the bisexual, morally confused coked-out protagonist Ellis' novel made him out to be.What a waste. This movie is ridiculous, containing absolutely none of the ambience of the novel. Instead we get stupid visuals (a party with 20 TVs all stacked up on one another, an idiotic fight at a party in Palm Springs with beautiful coked-out people looking on), that lend little to promote the plot. Essential characters from the novel (like Trent) that could have helped explain the relationships are missing. It's almost as if the screenwriters intentionally tried to make this movie as illogical as possible.I met Ellis' sister once. She told me that Bret was so embarrassed by what they did to his film that he refused to go to the premiere. Can anyone blame him?

James Spader was almost as intriguing as the pimp/drug dealer who was as cold as dry ice ! Andrew McCarthy however, seemed to be drowned by his supporting cast but has proved to be a beloved actor in his roles in Pretty in Pink & St. Elmo's Fire !

Less Than Zero encapsulates the nations obsession with the runaway greed is good, voodoo economics era of the 1980's. The move is highly stylized, and slick. It's Maimi Vice meets The Breakfast Club. I state this because it has elements of the now (unfortuneatly) defunct Brat Pack However, the depiction of Julian (played by Robert Downey Jr.)seems to be the embodiment of the age as it relates to cocaine, and crack-cocaine use, and the effect it had and in many cases still has on the lives of families friends, and love ones. For this reason as a baby boomer who lived through that era. I find the movie disturbing for its sheer view into the reality of lifestyle crashing into reality. I always try not to watch this movie. Sadly, I'm drawn into it like a moth to a flame. I think its a scared straight movie for the rich; or really any one that thinks that drugs are cool, glamorous, and harmless. From a directing, and acting standpoint its excellent. Marek Kaniveska did an excellent job setting the scene and style of Los Angeles high-life. Cars, money and clothes was what it was all about. Within that vein Kaniveska has put that portion of L.A. 80's lifestyle in the history books in this writers opinion Its really too bad the main characters are not as exposed as they once were in the industry. I think that anyone that sees this movie will enjoy it.

After watching it, I would definitely agree that it is nothing like the book, but I did like it for what it was.Clay (McCarthy) is coming back to Los Angeles for the Holidays. He meets up with his old Girlfriend, Blair (Gertz) and Best Friend, Julian (Downey). Clay last caught them in bed together during a Thanksgiving visit. It seems that for the past few months, Julian has developed a serious cocaine addiction that has put him $50,000 in debt with his vicious Coke Dealer, Rip (Spader).So what can I say? The film looks terrific. The Cinematography by Edward Lachman is amazing, and it is also highlighted by Thomas Newman's haunting score. The performances are great, particularly Robert Downey Jr as Julian (Who I think plays the part pretty accurately as his counterpart from the book), and although Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz get a lot of bashing for their performances, I think they're both quite effective. And Also worth noting is James Spader as Rip, who seems almost like an even slimier version of Stef from Pretty in Pink.Although it has its critics and it isn't an adaptation of the book, I personally love this movie and think that it deserves more credit than it gets.

Every time that I watch this movie I learn something new. This movie as many people know is Robert Downey Jr.'s break out film and boy, did he do a wonderful job. I think Robert did the most amazing depiction of a drug abusive young adult that anyone of his age or stature could even try to imitate. He was just amazing! You know, that someone is amazing in a movie when you can't see any other actor portraying his or her role and that's how I know Robert did an amazing job because i can't see any other actor at that time or even now who could portray the complexity of the character,Julian Wells, justice. The movie also includes Andrew Mccarthy, Jamie Gertz and James Spader, but clearly after watching Less than Zero all your left thinking about is Robert's performance. Don't get me wrong it was a perefectly casted cast as you know Andrew being the preppy college student and Jamie being the model/girlfriend and Spader being the villian/drug dealer but all you can think about is Julian and how everything in his life, no matter how hard he tried, just kept falling apart which therefore left him with no choice but to result to drugs. Even the director who hasn't directed many films is phenominal he gives a visonary to the audience the is just exceptional. And even the music in this movie is just great your left feeling the emotions as you listen to the music and I just find that completely rare now a days. As you can see i really do hold high regard to this movie and I actually do believe that if you took the time to watch it you would learn something from it and can apply it to your own life. And if there are any Robert Downey Jr., fans out there this movie would make you like Robert far beyond his irrestiable, amazing, gorgeous looks but it would make you look even further beyond that and have you respect him even more as an actor and as human-being, and even if you are not a huge Robert Downey Jr., fan this movie will convert you into one as soon as the credits start to roll. Again this is an Amazing movie both visually and physically (performance by Robert Downey Jr.,) so if your looking for a great movie to really leave you with something to think about rather, apply to your own life than this movie is for you and I can say this because I too have learned alot from it and I thank Robert from the bottom of my heart for making it!

That's hard to fathom.  And yet, in some way I'm glad, because yes this is a truly different kind of movie--praise be. And maybe slipped past people unnoticed.I think this movie is like a small volume of honest postcards. The first thing you note about it is its honesty (it never shows it off) and at no turn of the page does this volume let you down. One source for this honest texture is the trio of main characters. One is as original (in cinema terms) real, non-sentimental, and truly likable and unpretentious as the other--and yes they are like comrades (no jealousy, no violence, no loud star-type sex, almost no f word).  Perhaps the other source is that among the accumulation of scenes none is invasive or exploitative or stereotypical--all are kind of flat and equal and old postcardy in color and never drawing attention to themselves. So, you may think this must be one of those artsy films--and this reviewer is into this sort of thing.  Well, if it is, it has less than zero pretense to such and, therefore, no one would call it that. I guess the real irony here is that such an honest little gem of a film takes place in Beverley Hills and is about cocaine.

(spoilers for the novel and movie)","Date":"26 June 2004","Score":"15 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  'Less Than Zero' was a good book, but a horrible adaptation. The movie plays out like an anti-drug drama while the book explores California's wealthy socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness. With vicious characters similar to Igby Goes Down, and the unbearable and disgusting apathy of The River's Edge, the novel portrays a dark reality of over-privileged city sleaze with too way much money.The novel is narrated by Clay, an eighteen year old who returns home from his New Hampshire college for the winter holiday. Rightly characterized as a modern Holden Caufield, Clay just seems to watch his surreal existence among the wealthy Califorian socialites with disgust. It is like the Roaring '20s of The Great Gatsby, only much harsher. The characters have no emotional connection to one another, neither to family or friends. When asked where her parents are for the Christmas vacation, one girl, Kim, replies that she read in Vogue that her mother was in London, or perhaps Honolulu. Everyone just seems to be content (or kidding themselves that they are) in their meaningless rituals. Meeting at one club after another, doing endless amounts of coke, engaging in casual sex. These characters are, what Sandra Bullock's character in 'Murder By Numbers' refers to as the 'orphans.' Kids with too much money and no place to go, nothing to do. Their lifestyles have turned them into the most disgusting creatures who don't seem to acknowledge their state of uselessness. They consider it the good life. In fact, Clay does seem to be the only one to realize it. Though Blair may've once been his girlfriend and Julian may've once been his best friend in school, they don't seem to matter anymore as they get carried away with this lifestyle. Everyone has turned into this sort of Il Conformiste (notice that all characters are described as blond and tanned). Any sort of connection Clay might've had with his friends or family is lost. New Hampshire, I suppose, is his only escape from perhaps, fantasies of suicide. (Notice how he states at the end that he half-wished he could take Blair back with him). The movie is a ridiculous adaptation of the book. Important characters like Rip and Trent, the most disgustingly apathetic of the characters in the book (notice how they react when the twelve year old girl is hogtied to the bed at their friend's house or when they discover a dead body behind a club), are made trivial in the movie. And largely because the theme these useless characters made so by their money and by the city life (the same themes of the 20s and 30s) becomes only secondary to the anti-drug story. In fact, another 80s drug-themed movie of the decade, 'Big Lights, Bright City' with Michael J. Fox and Kiefer Sutherland (aside from the drug theme) does a better job at illustrating the type of sickening cycle of useless people Ellis was describing in his own novel. 'Less Than Zero' is one of a few of Ellis's novels that have come to be adapted to the screen. The same cast of characters, those rich useless kids of the city who delude themselves in a world of zero emotion or care, return in 'American Psycho,' 'The Rules of Attraction', and now 'Glitterama.' Although, I suppose 'The Rules of Attraction' is much closer to the novel 'Less Than Zero' in that one character comes to realize how pathetic that cycle is, and desperately seeks to escape it in the end.So, I'd say, the novel is good. The movie was not. I suppose the only saving grace of the movie is that yes, it was an 80s movie with the hot young stars of the decade (particularly Gertz and Spader who are always interesting to see). That, and the anti-drug message can't be totally disregarded, especially considering the decade. Although, then if that were all the filmmakers were looking for, then 1) it was done better the following year ('Bright Lights, Big City'; Clean and Sober), and 2) they didn't need an adaptation of a novel to create that kind of story. The movie is alright just by itself. But as an adaptation, the novel fares much better.Moreover, for those interested in reading the novel, this narrative makes an interesting comparison to the 1979 Terry Davis novel, 'Vision Quest,' which was also poorly adapted into film in the early 80s. Anyways, these are two very different books that would be quite interesting to read consecutively.

Decadence in wealthy Los Angeles, cocaine the major drug of choice for the 80s generation, along with parties, clubs, high priced cars and fashion. Andrew MCarthy is off to college probably at an elite private school while Downey has wasted away a promising recording industry career and savings, now an addict with no options for life advancement. Jamie Gertz is a model with a coke problem. Gertz was McCarthy's girl until he left for college, her ending up in bed with Downey. She beckons him to return because Downey owes drug/smut dealer James Spader(a more lavish version)and is doomed unless he gets help--question is can Downey make it out of his current state? Better yet, how can McCarthy rescue him when Gertz herself is often high on coke? McCarthy and Gertz do rekindle their relationship, sexually and otherwise, while attempting to save their pal from Spader's grip. Downey exhausts all methods for getting out of $50,000 that belongs to Spader, a lot of dope the young man has went through over the course of 6 months, and, to be honest, his dealer has been cooperative regarding lack of payment. So Spader wants Downey to hook for him, agreeing to substitute the work for his drug debt. So the viewer is treated to an unflattering look at life of the affluent youth when they are out at night. Downey's downfall is all too credible and harrowing, his fate unfortunate, suffering through one of those excruciating experiences where he must get clean, absolutely overcome with the sickness. Downey was forbidden by his fed-up father to come home, finding himself sleeping on park benches. Watching him deteriorate, helpless as his own two friends, we are treated to his decline. With lush cinematography to compliment the beautiful people who populate the LA scene, masking the real ugliness of it all. Rusty pipes says it all. Film is loaded with a number of great rock and pop songs.

And, Less Than Zero certainly looks and feels like the 1980s. It's thesis seems to be Pitiful rich kids, who lack parental guidance, could get bitten by the drug bug. But, this was based on a much more reflective story, by Bret Easton Ellis.Critics singled out Downey for praise, hence the video synopsis In a spellbinding dramatic performance, Robert Downey Jr. portrays Julian, a Beverly Hills brat who has it all looks, charm, smarts, a rich father - and a drug habit. His friend and girlfriend (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) are trying to help, but Julian's world is crumbling so fast, he might take them out with him. The result is a powerful and compelling story of three kids who started out with everything and are about to wind up with 'Less than Zero'.Apparently, a little eyeliner goes a long way.Downey would have been even better in the Rip Millar role as it was originally written; this isn't meant to suggest either he or James Spader (as Rip) are inadequate; as far as this film takes them, they're fine. But, the male prostitution angle just isn't believable when you compare it to the book; and, it's way off balance. Worse, the original novel's bisexuality is neutered to extinction. A subtler performance is given by Gertz; with less to go on, she fills up her portrayal of a beautiful model on cocaine.****** Less Than Zero (11/6/87) Marek Kanievska ~ Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader "},{"Title":"They Gave A Heartless Book Some Heart","Date":"23 December 2002","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  I can't say that much that none of the other posters have said but I must say I love this film.

I used to go to the circuit parties in Palm Springs. I went to the big clubs in LA. Studio One was THE hot place for many years. I went to my share of parties in Beverly Hills where coke was abundant. I never had to buy it. It was just everywhere. I went to one party where there was a mirror topped cocktail table with a pile of coke in the middle surrounded with razor blades and straws. It looked like someone had dumped a box of baking soda on the table.Having just watched this movie again for the first time in 20 years, I can objectively assess this as being an amazingly precise snapshot of the times. The only aspect of the film that could have been a bit more fun style-wise is the music. Yet, it might have been a bit too brat packish if it turned into a pop soundtrack movie like Sixteen Candles or Breakfast Club or Weird Science, etc. This story was not all about goofiness and teen angst. It was more adult and there really were a lot of people who got into trouble with coke and crystal in those days. They were easy to spot when you stood back. I also found it easy to stop myself from going too far by maintaining high awareness of my own situation. People into the fitness craze like me found it easier to resist going overboard because we always had our gym thing which required a clear head to keep it up. That whole scene really was mostly weekend partiers.I enjoyed watching this movie and going back in time. The film has its continuity flaws but I just couldn't see them. I was seeing too many memories to notice. I remember a Spring Break in Palm Springs where I ran into Arnold Schwartzenager at a Robinson's Dept. Store on Palm Canyon Drive. I was trying on a pair of shorts in a men's department dressing room and when I stepped out of the stall to look in the mirror Arnold stepped out of the stall next to mine wearing the exact same shorts as me.

While it isn't John Hughes, it's an interesting drama thanks to it's performances, especially Downey's, this role hitting a bit too close to home, and James Spader, as an oily drug supplier, while McCarthy basically just has to look sharp, smile and not say much, while I almost don't know what Gertz has to do, but just look independent. When graduating at the start, McCarthy had gone away for a while, and now he's back, only to find friend, Julian (Downey) at his worst with his drug habit, spiralling into a darker hell as referred to the movie's title, while Gertz is overly concerned. All three are from privileged families, Downey's father disowning him cause of his addiction. Downey shows some powerfully acted moments, too convincing you might say, like when he's really strung out, his supplier Spader, a really bad influence, ha ha, (different Spader movie reference) acting as a kind of pimp, when funds are short or due, making him do some weird stuff. Less Than Zero is a flashy energetic drama, all the more conflict driven, in Downey's character refusing to be helped. Based on Brett E Ellis, novel, Gertz uses the same line regarding snorting coke, as Jessica Biel does in 2003's Rules Of Attraction, based on another novel by Ellis. The film does have some messy areas, and it's ending, tragic for one, is thought provoking, but if you want John Hughes, go somewhere else.

In all fairness to the plot, it has been a couple of years since I read the novel, but it is clear that much was discarded in translation with the intention to present the film in the light of an anti-drug piece. The novel however was far more nihilistic than that and focused on the banality life for the over privileged elite. As I recall, several elements were retained in the film from the novel, but it felt like two completely different stories. I'm generally kind to adaptations and remakes in regards to view them independently of the work in which they're based, but this one was such a let down that I had a hard time not yelling at the television. That said, the film itself, ignoring the novel as much as humanly possible, was pretty middle of the road. The storytelling was shallow and clear-cut with little left up to the imagination and aside from a young Robert Downey Jr and James Spader, acting performances were marginal. It would be interesting to see this film remade by a director (and screenplay writer) that actually retains the vision that Ellis painted so vividly in his novel, but until then take this film with a grain of salt and read the novel instead. I give it a very generous 6/10.

Robert Downey Jr. is beyond fabulous. Having watched someone very close to me go through addiction, I can say that Downey's Julian is the most accurate addict I've ever seen portrayed on film. His hopeless optimism, random outburst of rage, and constant sweating all ring true. But everyone knows RDJ is brilliant. Andrew McCarthy does well with the character created by the screenwriters, but that character lacks depth. If you've read Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name and are expecting the apathetic, drug-addled, jerk narrator, step back 'cause you won't be getting it here. It's no surprise the author was only happy with RDJ and James Spader, their characters are the only ones who even vaguely resemble those of the novel. The novel is shocking to the point of being nauseating and down right disturbing. The film is not. It's a beautiful, vapid montage of 80s that sometimes drags. The soundtrack is killer, especially LLCoolJ's Going' Back to Cali and the Bangles cover of Hazy Shade of Winter. But back to the acting- a few times in the film, Jamie Gertz hits on something real and heart-wrenching, but it's fleeting and before you can sigh with relief, it's gone. Much of her performance is pretty wooden and her performance in the last scene is positively painful. The sex scenes are very realistic, though. Probably the best acting Gertz and McCarthy do in this film. If you're into costumes, check this film out- they're pure 80s perfection.

I read an earlier comment from someone who thought the music didn't fit, however I disagree. I thought it added significantly to the mood and the feel in many of the scenes.

Director Marek Kanievska and cinematographer Ed Lachman created a masterpiece of form and style, unlike any other film in the 1980s. Less Than Zero visual style was the first to blend the high style glossy fashion ad look of Los Angeles and Palm Springs with the first MTV generation energy of music videos.For example, one of the establishing scenes of the movie is the intro credits with Clay, portrayed by Andrew McCarthy in his finest role, arriving home to sunny L.A during Christmas Vacation. A yellow filter is placed over the lens so that L.A. glows. There is no dialog, but only the booming singing of The Bangles' rock cover of Simon & Garfunkels Hazy Shade of Winter. The palm trees go by as Clay's taxi floats into one of Beverly Hill's affluent neighborhoods. The music dies down as Clay enters his empty modern impersonal family home and plays the message machine, only to learn that both his parents could not be present to welcome him home.The foreshadowing is all there in that establishing scene with the credits - the lack of familial love, the emptiness and detachment of the main character that matches the hollow environment.The first party is a lavish F. Scott Fitzgerald Great Gatsbyesqe 1989 party filled with dozens of television playing video images timed to rock musics. There are theme winter wonderland rooms, where the fake snow on the floors represent the white cocaine being blown up the rich teen's noses.The plot of the film is loosely based on the brilliant first novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Mr. Ellis' novel stands as one of the most significant literary works of the late 20th Century.Many amateur film critics have criticized the film for not doing justice to Mr. Ellis' literary creation. Fortunately, I do not suffer from the misconception that a film must be judged by how exact it matches its literary inspiration, rather than judging the film on its own merit.Screenwriter Harley Peyton, who was rumored to produce a first draft closely following the novel, modified his script into a lean script that could be transformed into a brilliant motion picture. The essence of isolation, friendship, drug-addition, and lost youth remains. I would argue that a closer adaptation of Mr. Ellis' novel would not have made a good film, because rarely on screen is it successful to portray a main character without emotion. Mr. Peyton needed to create character arcs, where the characters start one place and over the course of the film has some change, whether positive or negative. Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of his life (literally) portraying the drug addict that he was to become and which almost ruined his career.One of my favorite shots in film is the second to last shot. Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr. and Jami Gertz sit mourning in Clay's classic Corvette which sits on a lonely road in the middle of the desert surrounded by Joshua trees. A flyover shot of the desert closes in for a close-up on the Corvette and the devastated main characters. The shot is breathtaking.Taken in context of film history of the 1980s, this is a clearly darker take on youth, than the John Hughe's stories of the time, like Pretty in Pink (1984) and The Breakfast Club (1985). Less Than Zero - the film and the novel should be a must see film and must read novel for every serious film viewer and reader.

It tells the story of a complete waster with masses of talent and ideas who falls victim to cocaine/drug addiction and all that surrounds it. It seems extremely ironic that the waster is played by Robert Downey Jr whose own drugs hell has been very public (funnily enough he played a similar character in 1969!). We also see the lengths that his true friends are prepared to go to to try to help him.I personally believe this is one of the best films I've ever seen. It has everything you could ever want from a film, especially when you're depressed. It helps one to see that, in most cases, other people's lives can be so much worse!There is some fairly wooden acting, especially that from McCarthy and Gertz. Downey however is superb, as is James Spader as the slimy drug-dealer Rip.The film also contains one of the best soundtracks I've heard with music from the likes of Jimi Hendrix (Fire) and Kiss (? - Rock and Roll all Night). Even the incidental music, by Thomas Newman (6 Feet Under) is very emotive.All in all a very underrated film.

Hollywood was eager to buy the rights to this best-selling novel, but Hollywood was also too chicken to actually film it... so they ran the novel through a wringer, and what came out on the other side is a formula story of two friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) who try to stop a third friend (Robert Downey Jr.) from taking a drug-fueled elevator straight to hell. And director Marek Kanievska even manages to foul that up, too.The really frustrating thing about this film is how good the cast is--or rather, how could it COULD have been if absolutely anything about this sorry waste of time and money had been worth a damn. This is a really, truly shabby bit of hyped-up commercialism without any substance to it at all, badly written, directed, and filmed, and the only other title to which I can compare it is the abominable Didi Conn film YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE.

You lose all that in the movie by censuring it. And I'm not defending the horrible things that happened in the book, I'm just saying that Less than zero was kinda of a morbid reading.Another thing they ignored (and it couldn't be because of censorship) was the ad that said 'DISSAPPEAR HERE', that constantly followed Clay through the city.

With the legalization of the pot in Washington, Oregon, and soon to be Alaska in 2015, drugs can be political and are often talked around my high school; for example If weed should be legal or not. I will also say high school is where sadly I am most exposed to drugs. You know who the drug dealers are, who's been arrested over it and I can't tell you how times in my study hour I have overheard a story about a local party involving the drugs and alcohol.Yes, there are stoner films but films that have a plot of a person dealing with a drug addiction are not that common. It is hard to an find audience for these films which have a depressing atmosphere. The one film that should always to mind with drug addiction though is Less then ZeroBlair (Jami Gertz), Clay Eaton (Andrew McCarthy) and Julian Wells (Rober Downey Jr.) are all college age kids during Christmas time in affluent Los Angeles. Blair and Clay are a former couple who's relationship faltered after Blair cheated on him with Julian leaving all three friends in a awkward stance. During this Christmas break, we learn that Julian now has a severe drug problem and sometimes sleeps on a cliff on a beach due to the fact that's his parents kicked him out of the house. Julian also can't pay off his drug debt to drug dealer Rip (James Spader). It is part drug film, part relationship film.Truthfully, these are somewhat simple lead characters. These are characters who are trying their best to get away from high school problems and are trying to get a foot in the real world. It is the Downey character who is the most interesting. Director Marek Kanievska does a good job of making you feel like you have already known Julian. With some great acting by Downey, you are truly frustrated with his antics and you have no confidence that he is going to stop buying drugs like says he will. You do want him to get better because you miss that cocky, smart-ass character that briefly appears before he becomes stoned and strung out. It is hard to like Blair because of the cheating and she could possibly go down the same road as Julian but she eventually does find herself. The McCarthy character doesn't have much substance compared to the others and he is truly the only character with a clean record and you do have respect for how he tries to save his friend. Released in 1987, we do see the 80's fashion/style, and 1980's Los Angeles culture is a major theme in the film. These are all kids who parents never had money troubles, who think it is normal to wear suits and dresses every day and drive flashy cars. This rich culture is presented to us in a way that fits very nicely into the drug plot.Less Than Zero won't seem to be a stand-out film. It is mostly remembered for being an 80's film and some of it's cast and an ironically Downey had severe drugs problems afterwards in the 90's but we should remember Less Than Zero more for how well it is made.

Never have I been so moved, to the point of tears (and I never cry). The film is about 3 friends Clay (Andrew McCarthy), Blair (Jami Gertz), and Julian (Robert Downey Jr). They have just left High School and are all off to enter the real world. Clay goes to University, Julian tries to fund a record project, and Blair gets into modelling. After a year apart, things have changed. Clay comes home at Blairs request due to her concerns about Julian after his record project falls apart, he gets into debt, and heavily involved in drugs. The remainder of the film explores the struggles between the three friends being reunited and seeing how each one has changed. Whilst Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz give very poor acting, very little emotion, it is Robert Downey Jr and James Spader (Who plays Rip) who steal the show and make the film worth while. The film has a very rustic 80's feel to it along with a fantastic soundtrack in-fitting with the films story. The film is supposed to based on the book Less Than Zero by Brett Easton, but is only very loosely based. If you are a fan of the book i'd watch it with caution.

The direction, too, is static, at least compared to what it could have been. This is a story that should not be given democratically. Like American Psycho and The Rules of Attraction, Less Than Zero needs a production team willing to take risks, plunge into their own subterranean perceptions of the film. The Rules of Attraction, for instance, has a twisted subreality brought to its technical aspects by Roger Avary, a filmmaker with a penchant for numbingly gloomy subjects, as he had previously made clear with his contribution to Pulp Fiction and his first directorial effort, the dismal, brutalizing bank robbery film Killing Zoe.

The script didn't help them, and if they had some better lines, I might have liked them better.I haven't read the book, but from what I've read, it wasn't an accurate adaptation. If it was accurate, I would have wondered why they made such a bad book into a film. But I will have to hunt down the book, because I'm sure it's better than this movie.Well I think that's enough negative for one review and I shall now proceed to Robert Downey Jr. I was captivated by every moment that he was on the screen. I could name so many scenes from this movie that blew me away and made me bawl like a little baby (I will name a few later). He is the sole redeeming feature of this movie, and if I were to watch this again (which I know I will) it will be to see him work his magic again. His performance is so moving and powerful, it will hit you like a sack of bricks. He was truly given all the best lines. The funny ones and the heart-wrenching ones.

The desperation that Downey portrays is simply heart-breaking.2. When Blair and Clay find Julian on the stairs and they look after him, is very hard to watch, yet you can't take your eyes off Downey.

With all their good fortune of being brought up in a society where they can choose to do anything, they do nothing.Where setting has both faithfully and successfully been adapted from Ellis' original material, two key elements have been changed which hold the movie back. Though McCarthy plays his role very well, the trouble is in the writing. Clay's subdued yet conscious driven character is written for the screen as a vehicle to guide us through this weird world of endless excess. He is there so we can have someone to sympathize with while we try to absorb everything around us.This is a grave miscalculation.Rarely do I critique movies on how they were changed from their original work, but the screenwriters have done the novel an injustice. Clay, as he was written in the novel, should be just as disaffected as his friends. He is no better or worse, he is just alive enough to notice what is going on around him after coming home from three months abroad. He also has a terrible cocaine problem of his own. The brilliance in the novel is, just like Nick in the Great Gatsby, Clay is an unreliable narrator. He is able to live as a real character, have good and bad things happen to him, and still have no control of the outcome in the story. He is powerless because he is completely indifferent. Things only change in his perceptions of how they actually happen. This is almost vital to the story in that it opens with the premise that things can't possibly get worse, yet by the end, they don't get any better. Sure, a reliable storytelling method works for the movie. It is an easy way out though, and Ellis' critically objective think for yourself method turns into a preachy sympathy play where morals are instructed rather than figured out with attention to style and detail.The second change, one that must have stirred up much controversy, is the rampant moral righteousness, even in material as seemingly morally depraved as this. Again, these are not simple, I wish they had done this gripes, they are critiques on events that truly deter from the message of the original material. As for the latent amount of sexual ambiguity that is missing from the movie, I believe it was viewed as too delicate of a subject. A reason the novel is so shocking is because it was published in a time when drugs and homosexuality were not discussed in terms of adolescents who could do it and get away with it. However, It is important to note that the characters should not be viewed as bisexual, but rather sexually indifferent. The children were never taught the difference between right and wrong. They have no sense of moral decency and no concept of sensitivity or the meaning of love.They do whatever gives them instant pleasure.We realize early on that Clay cannot save Julian. However, it is all the more powerful and dreadful for Julian to be left alive in his human hell hole with Clay indifferent as he is in the end of the novel than to have Julian die in the car with Clay hugging Blair. At the time, these subjects must have been of some concern to the producers. They obviously wanted viewers to take the film seriously and not as satirical as the book is presented. Still, while Julian's death is a sad scene, nothing can be worse than being stuck in this moral wasteland.While the film focuses on having everything and losing it all, the brilliance of the novel is being unable to lose any of it. That's real hell.

Absolutely everything is off key. Watching this movie was like a form of punishment. Than there's the fact that the whole tone of voice the book took on is non-existent in the film. So many characters were left out. So many dubious choices were taking in adapting the story for film. The term 'loosely based on' doesn't even begin to fit the bill. Somebody better have been slapped for this horrible piece of memorabilia back in the '80's. Robert Downey Jr. gave away a decent enough performance, true. James Spader did a good job, sure.

Number one, it captures the excesses of the 'BIG' 80's, and Robert Downey Jr. gives a gut-wrenching performance. The shallow, self-destructive behavior; the greed; and the vanity that cloaks it all are very well captured in this movie. The movie, itself, kind of parallels the world it is depicting. On the surface everything looks great. People smile in their $2000.00 shirts, and perfect faces. They live in million dollar homes. But, underneath the pretty picture is parental alienation, drug abuse, and just good-old fashioned unhappiness. The scene where Clay tells Blair that she does not look happy, and her response is, But do I look good! sums up the shallow emptiness of an entire decade.

Understandably, no major studio in the eighties would have made a prestige movie about a bunch of degenerate bisexual coke fiends that run around seemingly aimlessly, without any overt message or epiphany from any main character.  This being said, I think a little credit should have been granted Ellis for creating characters with enormous depth while seeming totally void of moral values.  Recent movies have done this very successfully, and even other Ellis adaptations have come out so much better. So, as a glitzy movie about hardcore drug use made in the middle of the John Hughes era, it's very good.  However, since the book's characterization and central themes were ultimately ignored, the movie fails horribly as a novel adaptation.

I really enjoyed the movie, in particular the cinematography- the colors, the sets, the clothes, etc. The opening credit sequence with Hazy Shade of Winter set a good feel for the film.  I particularly enjoyed Jamie Gertz, and her line, But do I look good? (which, along with the Let's F--k X-Mas Together! party invitation was one of the few things taken directly from the book.)  Her character was written most loyal to the book, as opposed to Andrew McCarthy, who in the book was a self-destructive, promiscuous, bisexual drug-user.

But the somehow the swirl of downward events just captivated me.It begins with a graduation, with nothing but bright futures ahead of the three characters - a club owner, a model and a college bound kid.  But a snapshot picture is taken there and a skillful change of music tells you that this is not to be a happy film - it is a tragedy.  The rest of the film is just a string of depressing events that leads to the ultimate demise.What made me watch this?  Well, it's for anyone who's ever experienced failure (all of us).  Compare the graduation with the mark of hope, an opening for wishful thinking.  At graduation it's easy to say you're going to do something, to make something more of yourself because all your options are open.  But, in reality it's more likely you would fail, get sidetracked, or just end up doing something else.  Despite all the opportunities that come up throughout the film (the rehab, the $50,000, the friendship) we already know how it will end.The end, with the scene of the empty plains furthers the idea of desolation. The road they were on was the road of their life, the promise of the future.  Julian cannot go further down that road and his fate should not be surprising.Less than Zero is yet another of those somewhat philosophical movies that will not satisfy you with answers but leave you questions about your own life and what you have done with it.

While Ellis's book was like seeing an Altman film with multiple characters completely tuned on drugs and MTV, an electrifying but repetitive and endless story (looks like there's a sequel in development), the film changes drastically this point of view by changing facts, characteristics of characters and giving some moralistic lessons that could work better in another similar film. The advantage of the film is a more coherent storyline instead of a mosaic of characters that almost goes nowhere.Clay (Andrew McCarthy) takes a break from college by visiting his friends in L.A., the now drug addicted Julian (Robert Downey Jr.) and Blair (Jami Gertz), the latter who wants to help Julian to get out of his present situation of eternally owing money to Rip (James Spader), a guy who makes of Julian a male whore because he needs his money back and he needs it fast. The world of drugs is glamorously presented here with most of the characters having fun at parties all the time; this is pretty close to the book except that Clay, a more wrong doing type of guy gets transformed in the film version into a cool guy, who doesn't take drugs and is very helpful to everyone. Less Than Zero is a good film, simply because it knows how to impress its audience on a difficult subject; it shows how low wealthy kids can reach to get money, drugs, and the portrayal of Julian's addiction is very convincible, nervous, a warning to make people stay out of narcotics. But, on the other hand the movie covers things that are more impressive, more shocking and better executed in films like Christiane F. (1983) or Bright Lights, Big City (1988) for example, which makes it difficult to someone really relate with everything that was showed in this film. Let's say, while Christiane F. frightens you about the drugs problem, Less Than Zero might give you a light aspect about drugs, something more colorful, more appealing and less negative.Composed of a good soundtrack (but not as much as the book, if you read it Ellis really puts music references in his works), the 1980's great visual style, and average performances from the cast, here's a watchable film, not as bad as people say, totally easy to follow and with many good things to offer.

Less Than Zero has become an cult movie over the years. Since it is based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho, The Rules of Attraction). The novelist truly hated this film at film until he changed his mind about it over the years.

Ironically enough more from Robert Downey, Jr. Gee, I wonder where he gets the inspiration from. Over all, Less than Zero is a pretty decent film, it is very dark though, not for kids at all. I'm not entirely sure how some scenes were worked in the film or even if Andrew and Jamie even had a story together.Realistic enough to be a DARE movie, but not enough where you're brutally scared into not doing drugs.

I believe it displays the apathy of the characters beautifully. I've tried to read the book. And this is where bias comes in. I can't get through it. I still intend to, someday, but now it is just too difficult for me. I get through one or two chapters and I feel the depression of it too much. I feel the pointlessness in life too much. I'm aware of Ellis's ability for this very reason but, for me, it's too much for now. But this is why I'll stand by the movie in the face of all those who say it does the novel no justice. I watch the movie and I see the same apathy and hopelessness in the characters as my brief experiences with the books but to a degree that is more bearable. The story is still tragic. The characters are still painful to see. It may be all sorts of flashy with TV stacks and pretty cars but that doesn't make the message any less there. It may be all drugs are bad but, sorry, where is that not in the book? Art can take human expressions to the greatest extremes so that only the most open minded and intelligent can see the true beauty of the work but, I argue, art is then only preaching to the choir. Sometimes it is just pretensions to claim that there isn't enough suffering. Sometimes great art reaches out to the masses, to those who won't get the message if it's too ugly but, hopefully, a few will if it's just ugly enough(and I'm not enough of a movie buff to claim this is an example of great art, just honest and secure enough to suggest the possibility that it has more worth than the intelligentsia seem to suggest). Could it have been uglier and still maintained enough appeal to make it past the film festivals and art house theaters? Maybe. I really don't know. But I'm quite certain that, so long as you aren't looking for an exact representation of the novel or some other ideal of apathetic perfection, as long as you can, at the very least, treat it as a work unto itself and suspend your disbelief in the theatric tradition it is more than a fluffy anti-drug movie. I don't use drugs and can still relate to the movie's version of Clay, Blair, and, even Julian.

The whole thing takes place in a 6 month period - but the events and decline of the characters seems like it should have happened over a couple of years. Main to this is the absence/presence of Clay back home and how quick Julian falls apart. They graduate in June it seems, Clay hangs out with Blair all summer and Julian takes him to the airport in late August to go to college. Things seem fine at this point. Even at the grad. scene, Julian's Dad seems to be on good terms with him. The we see in the flashback scene that Clay came home for Thanksgiving (late November) and caught them together in bed. Then Clay come home again for Christmas (a mere 4 weeks later) and he and everyone acts like so much has changed since he's been gone - but he was just there a month before!!! Plus, the business failures by Julian and his debt seem like they accumulated over a longer period, like a couple of years at least.

Yes, Downey plays what is essentially his own life, and as such is not acting or a portrayal at all, merely a man placing on film that which he did (does?) in real life. The starkness and minimalistic home serves as graphic metaphor for the emptiness and overwrought empty people that populate Southern California.Playing a too slick for his own skin universal male, McCarthy would soon go nowhere after the making of this film. An effete isolationist, McCarthy is perfect for the role, waiting and waiting, and waiting yet some more for the inevitable death of a loser we are evidently supposed to feel sorry for.

Almost a cold witness, which Mcarthy just can't act out. This film is beyond his acting skills. It needed some one like Jake Gyllenhall. Blair is the one who has dealt with it firsthand, but seems lost and helpless, and very hypocritical. Gertz can barley manage out a no at the end. i would have preferred to see someone like Scarlett Johansen or Kiera Kightly, or someone who has never acted before, to capture her sense of vulnerability and weakness. Julian is the one character that didn't change in the book. There is a sense of despair about him, a childlike quality. Downey is the only one who could pull this of. He gives a genuinely touching performance of Julian and makes that character so real you want to reach out and save him. The look on his face after he turns his first trick, that mixed look of shame and horror hit hard and and puts a sour feel in the pit of your stomach. The withdrawal seen is the most realistic thing i have ever seen. It is almost impossible to watch but impossible to stop. Then there is Rip the sleazy drug dealer.

They remind me of the comedy duo from that Wake up and Smile Saturday Night Live sketch. However, they were SO bad I started to think it must be intentional and that their hapless performances are almost effective, because it reflects the helplessness that their characters experience, and it makes them into puppets or props for the real stars of this film Robert Downey Jr. and James Spader. First Spader, he utterly rocks (as usual). Did any one else notice his catch phrase old sport? Nice little reference to The Great Gatsby. And the sensuality with which he hugs his former lover Julian before sentencing him to a night of hell in the Palm Springs suite could melt anyone's heart. But oh, Downey. RDJ just hits every line so perfectly and every aspect of his character just oozes his personality and emotes the heartache he experienced later on in life. I can watch this film over and over and I'm always moved by the scene on the tennis court with his father and the scene where he has the towel on his head. He WOULD have made it, you know.

I had forgotten the profoundness to be found, at times, in the eyes of  Andrew McCarthy- in fact, I had forgotten Andrew McCarthy.  His character of Clay is the most complex in this story and therefore the most challenging to portray and his quiet and doubtful performance works perfectly to communicate a young man who has trouble expressing his feelings or even realizing his desires and yet is trapped in a time in life where new and strange feelings and situations come without warning or control. Clay has gone away to school in the East Coast and struggles to maintain a long distance relationship with his girlfriend, Blair. He returns to LA six months later to find everything and everyone predictably the same, with one exception.  Cocaine has become a major addition to the spoiled lifestyle of his wealthy ilk.  His best friend, Julian played with, at moments, gut wrenching pain, by Robert Downey Jr., has become totally addicted to smoking cocaine and has lost all his money and is in debt and cutoff from his parents and...etc. Since Downey has been in all the magazines and tabloid TV lately, concerning his arrests and continuous drug taking, watching his performance here was in some ways devilish fun yet too prophetic indeed.I was touched by the basis of McCarthy's numb performance being that in Clay's separation from his best friends and in turn their separation from him- that change in niche, seemed the root of all decadence. Those childhood years of both safety and recklessness pass away very fast and time forces all to grow up for the mere necessity of living, yet Clay has the angst of a young man who feels like he doesn't belong anywhere and latches on to those people who represent something familiar even if his feelings toward those people have, in time and absence, turned apathetic.Again, I was hooked by the film and surprised at how slick and ultimately powerful it was. I've read mostly bad reviews of the film, yet I tell you it is a well-acted, well-directed film focusing on characters and their unique predicaments and not simply a drug movie like countless others.

Check this film out first!","Date":"3 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  There have been some good films that deal with the anti-drug issue.  Films that take that issue and show it's seedy side are important because a lot of what you see in Hollywood simply glorifies drugs.  And I don't mean things like pot and weed and grass and such, those drugs, to me, are harmless if they are done moderately.  But what is harmful is something as potent as cocaine.  Less Than Zero is a film that takes that notion and runs with it.  There is nothing subliminal about it, nothing questionable and nothing really left to wonder what to think about heavy drugs and the affect they can have on a person.  Less Than Zero has been accused of glorifying drugs and making them look trendy and fun and popular.  But that is as far from the truth as saying that Angel Heart is a movie about a missing person.  Less Than Zero does not glorify drug use in here, it treats it like it is an abomination.There are three main characters in this film.  Andrew McCarthy plays Clay, Jami Gertz is Blair and Robert Downey Jr. plays Julian.  All three are incredibly wealthy kids.  So wealthy are they that upon graduation Julien's dad gets him into the recording indsutry and Clay goes to an Ivey League school in the east leaving behind his girlfriend.  By thanksgiving Blair and Julien are sleeping together and doing lots of cocaine and by Christmas Blair is calling Clay and begging him to come home and get Julien clean.  Julien is out of control and not only have drugs taken control of his life but he has lost everything that his dad has given him.  He has lost the recording studio, he has spent all of his money and his father has kicked him out of the house.  He is broke and now he owes his drug dealer in excess of fifty thousand dollars.  Played by James Spader, Rip, the drug dealer is actually not a bad guy.  He has given Julien many chances and lets his debt slide for longer than he should in the name of friendship.  As he tells Clay,  I'm not the problem, Julien is.  If this was another person that Julien owed money to, he may have been dead by now.  But these are friends that are dealing with each other so there is a grace period.  The end of the film is actually a bit of a shock as we are not quite ready to see the ultimate fate for Julien.  Even though we can see what road he is travelling, we are quite sure that somehow, someway Clay is going to get him through this.  But perhaps as in real life with a person that is controlled by any substance as dangerous and addictive as cocaine, fairytale endings are just that----fairytales.This film is powerful because of the performances, the subject and the direction, but what separates it from a typical film about drug abuse ( and this is probably why people say that drugs are glorified in the film ) is how it is photographed.  Hollywood is shot as though it was a music video.  Here we are introduced to clubs that open at midnight and are decorated with beautiful people that look like they are all models.  The cars are fast and expensive, people's clothing are Armani suits, Ralph Lauren polo shirts, Calvin Klein jeans and any other assortment of expensive threads.  Every house and even certain nightclubs have huge pools with aqua-marine water, there are ceilings that are littered with televisions that show constant music videos and Sunset Boulevard looks like it is the most happening place in the world.  But all of this is a disguise for the lure and appearance of pleasure.  Because what lies beneath all of this glitz and glamour and fame and parties is nothing but a troublesome addiction that ends up destroying a young man's life.  Less Than Zero will make you want to think twice about ever getting into that scene.  It may look glamorous but it is a dead end road.  This was one of the best films to come out of 1987 and Robert Downey Jr. really should have won best supporting actor that year.  His outing as the drug addicted Julien was something that legends are made of.  Many people have passed on this film over the years because many people heard that it did nothing but show drugs as being a positive in a young person's life.  Well if losing your fortune, beoming a prostitute, sleeping on the beach, puking every day, going through withdrawls, having your family disown you and ultimately suffer the worst of fates is a way to glorify cocaine then this does that.  I happen to think otherwise, and if you could ask any one of the three main characters that same question, I think they would agree with me.

The movie takes Ellis' wild, rapid decent through the disillusionment of drug-addled, high class LA teens and warps it into some sort of half-hearted anti-drug flick. Clay, the main character, goes from being an sometimes participant, sometimes observer of the seedy network of coke, sex, power, money and beauty to some sort of moral compass, honorably struggling to fight his friends' addictions and help them get their lives back on track. The movie feels contrived, dishonest and flat-out cheesy, where the book feels unabashedly honest and sickeningly eye-opening. Yes, it is very colorful and shiny, but this is only to distract from the fact that the plot has been horribly convoluted and substance has been compromised for flash and cheap 80s gimmicks. And the music is nowhere near as good as described in the book. In the book, the mid-80s music/club scene is a constant underlying part of every surreal scene. The book has X playing at the Roxy, Blondie on the radio and unending references to the big new wave and punk groups at the time. The movie has Cheap Trick playing at a party. How many coke addicts danced to Cheap Trick?James Spader does fine as Rip. It's not his fault that his character was an awkward combination of very different people from the novel. As for Robert Downey Jr.... he does just fine, but honestly, playing a drug addict in the 80s isn't exactly a stretch for him. Andrew McCarthy's performance as Clay is very, very forgettable, and downright disappointing to anyone who's expecting to see the direct reflection of Ellis that Clay represents in the novel. Even if you haven't read the book, this one just really isn't worth renting unless you can talk someone else into paying for it.

This is a statement that Robert Downey Jr shouts at Andrew McCarthy. If only this is what the film did. I swear by the time the end credits rolled around I was expecting Nancy Reagan and Robert Evans to show up. Then there would be all those singing children and 'just say no' slogans everywhere. Great... I feel flashbacks of Punky Brewster coming on...no...no...no!@%!    I have not read the book. However, I do not think that Ellis would make a morality tale that is this heavy handed. The director almost literally tells you that if you take financial risks on something dodgy like the music business that you will lose all your money. It also says if you do drugs, cocaine in this movie, you will become a male prostitute that will be forced to service a very fruity looking James Spader. If you do drugs you will eventually die in a desert. However before that event you will also sleep in strange places and harass small children on swings. It is shown that if you are McCarthy's character, if you go to university, work hard and have a conventional life that you will be fine. There is certainly no way that you would end up as a man-whore who hangs out at spa pools with floating neon phones. FLOATING NEON PHONES!?!?! Boy did I laugh when I saw this. These things actually existed? HA!  This film has quite a bit of unintentional humor. I think it is because the director is a bit of a hack. Take the setting, this was almost too eighties for words! But hey, you have to have a Nam June Paik television set design when you film a party that is intended for 80's yuppies! McCarthy was part of the 80's brat pack and I am glad he is pretty much off the mainstream acting radar. Wasn't he in the atrocious, 'weekend at Bernie's?' He just does not have much talent and gets on your nerves fairly early. Jamie Gertz brings absolutely nothing to the role. Her acting goes from terrible to bearable. However it isn't much of a role and she just seems to be there to hold Roberts head as he vomits. Robert Downey Jr shines here though, his performance actually shows some talent.  However this is not hard as all the other performances range from camp to awful. Also this role is so close to the truth for him, maybe he did not click that he was actually in a film...What was funny was when he he was led inside and started to impersonate Frankenstein has he headed to the toilet too vomit. The film is also predictable because right from the start you know Julian is going to die. He has to because he sniffs that evil white powder and he also slept with McCarthy's girl. That is another thing. If you were an up and coming businessman. One of those power tie wearing individuals who says things like 'lunch is for wimps!' Or 'if you want a friend buy a dog!' Would you then start up a relationship with a former girlfriend who not only has a serious drug problem but also has cheated on you with your best friend? My god! It sounds like a Jerry Springer episode and is testing the story's credibility on a massive scale.    The other thing is James Spader. Now I like Spader, I like him when he plays weirdo's like the main character from David Cronenberg's absolutely abnormal 'Crash.' But here he plays a pimp, drug dealer who seems to have watched Spartacus one to many times. His hair has the sought of 80's gel perfection that would make you cross the road if you saw him on the street. Every time I saw him on the screen I laughed. He even wears a coat! Obviously this makes him a pervert! This is what the director is trying to get across with all of the the subtlety of a sledgehammer! I own a large black coat and  every time I wear it people either think I am going to kill a bunch of people. Or try and sell them drugs, or maybe flash them. Long coats are out! In fact Spader's character sums up the whole movie when he declares that everyone here is an a**hole. Not a more truer word has been said about these yuppie idiots. I give this a 3/10. 1 for Julian's expression just before he vomits. 1 for the floating neon phone. 1 for Spader's hair.

Although not perfect by far, I believe the film has received an unwarranted amount of criticism from fans of the Bret Easton Ellis novel and from critics, though regard for it seems to have increased with age. It is now undoubtedly a cult classic, one that seems to look better on screen than it did in the 80's, and in retrospect to portray a famously decadent period in history beautifully. The film focuses on the experience of college student Clay (McCarthy) when he returns to LA from the East Coast for the Christmas holidays. He encounters his ex-girlfriend Blair and best friend Julian, whose lives have dramatically disintegrated in the drug-fuelled club culture of 80's LA. The three main leads play their roles with sensitivity and poise, and not even the worst detractor of the film could criticise Downey Jr's virtuoso performance as Julian Wells, one of the most harrowing and bleak depictions of a drug addict I've ever seen. The problem is that people need to stop comparing the film with the source novel, because it is indeed a radical departure from the book. The novel lacks a serious plot, aimlessly examining a succession of nihilistic rich teenagers, bouncing from one sordid vice to another. The narrator, Clay, is indifferent to much of what is around him, and most of the time is as depraved as everyone else. Although I'm a fan of the book, it never would have translated into a mainstream film, the characters needed to have some level of sympathy and heart. Although I admit Less Than Zero could be a little edgier and have maintained the dark, cynical tone of the book, it still is a very insightful and hard-hitting piece. The film does at times feel like a Reaganesque anti-drug commercial, but McCarthy's moralising is kept to a minimum and his portrayal still maintains an observant coldness loyal to the novel's Clay. Jami Gertz's Blair is likewise hugely different from the novel, she is the emotional heart of the movie, desperately trying to keep her triangular friendship group together, nostalgically clinging to the past. And James Spader once again plays the quintessential villain, this time in the form of drug dealer Rip, managing to combine likability with a sinister evil. One of the best features of the film is its visual appeal, it is so well filmed, lit and glamorously designed it instantly draws you into the affluent and decadent world of the characters. Their world is beautifully superficial and over the top, and you can easily relate to Clay's disorientation after returning from the East Coast, and the lack of reality all the characters seem to struggle with. The soundtrack also complements this surrealness, with a strange mix of hip-hop and rock and a powerful early score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty, The Shawshank Redemption,etc...)

Bad.The only redeeming element of this film is, of course, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.One of the main points of the book was that the main character, Clay, was extremely disillusioned and apathetic towards the LA lifestyle and his relationship with Blair.  The Julian character was only in about ten percent of the book, and James Spader's character wasn't quite as much of an antagonist.Granted, the book didn't have too much of a conventional plot, so I can see why they decided to change it, but good Lord, do Bret Easton Ellis some justice!

He should have had a bigger part and another let down was that how the film ended. Besides that this is a movie worth checking out as it wasn't filled with the Brat Packers of the 80s. The only thing unrealistic was that we were supposed to believe that Blair, Clay, Julian and Rip were 18/19 years old.

Hey growing up in that era we always watched movies with Andrew McCarthy,James Spader and the sexy Jami Gertz. Although I would say this has to be Gertz' worst acting, although I think she is portraying an airheaded rich kid here. Lost Boys and Renegades were her best. Seems after Twister her star just sort of vanished. Under rated actress by far.Anyhow McCarthy actually is good in this, finally he gets a main character in a film instead of a role shadowed from those other brat packers he always seemed to be following from movie to movie. He plays a preppie rich kid without the attitude and is the friend who cares about his long time friends. James Spader, unlike others, I have always liked. Seems he just never got that big break ever but he is under rated in my view. He play the rich drug dealer prick and like in Pretty In Pink, plays it well. And then there's Robert Downey Jr. He plays, no pun intended here, a drug addicted rich spoiled brat who owes big cash to Spader for the drugs. His family won't bother giving him handouts anymore and so he ends up doing, well watch it for his character. Seems Downey Jr plays this role PERFECT. Sad to see him end up as one in real life. Basically if you like the 80's brat pack flicks that all of us in our late 20's to 30's grew up watching, rent it for sure. I'm sure it will make you remember all those party days in your high school/college years and this flick is definitely not boring. The end is quite sad and it will show you that no matter what friends go through, the true ones will always be there in the end.

The crux of the story is that Julian (Robert Downey Jr) is a f***-up who burned his bridges with his wealthy father, drifted into a non-existent record producing career and spent up 50 grand on a drug connection (James Spader), and now needs his high school friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jamie Gertz) to bail him out and get him clean. At the least it does portray the total dregs of coke addiction on a wretched level late in the picture as Downey's character goes through terrible, cold-sweat/vomiting withdrawal, the likes of which, at the least, wouldn't be seen in a common after school special. Morale of the story kids, don't go to LA and act like a f***-up! I can't say for sure how faithful the picture is to Bret Easton Ellis's book (his first one), and from all accounts I've read it's at best loosely based. This doesn't necessarily mean it might have been better or worse if it were more faithful; Rules of Attraction may be totally true to the book but it's own ambitions- however more ambitious than Less Than Zero- are its undoing. Suffice to say in the spectrum of current Ellis adaptations it rests between the masterpiece American Psycho and the mixed bag of 'Attraction.' Aside from clichés in the story presented here the biggest problem lies in casting McCarthy and Gertz, however pretty together, are only OK cat best and at worst are what they appear pretty people who can't act very well (I almost though McCarthy and Spader could've switched places and made for an interesting change-up). Spader is very good, if maybe predictably slimy after seeing him play the kind of role a lot. And the music by the usually great Thomas Newman is soap-operaish.Why recommend it then, aside from those who can't get enough of 80s coke movies? First, Robert Downey Jr. I'm reminded here of his most recent turn in Tropic Thunder where he relays the theory on Full Retard/Half-Retard and how actors get completely acclaimed if they go halfway but if they overshoot it it's too much. On that quasi-scale Downey goes at about Three-Quarters Addict in Less Than Zero, which is to say that it's a perfect breakthrough performance; this is an actor who reveals himself and goes naked emotionally and occasionally goes so for broke it's genuinely frightening, and he's even amusing in little slivers to boot when not appearing as fatalistic as he is (and, as well, a mature performance, which at 21 or 22 is also extraordinary). The second reason, which may vary depending on the viewer, is the wonderful capturing of the 80s club scenes, where the music wasn't just New-Wave or Heavy Metal, but a variety of whatever there could be to dance to, and this is presented with great verve and song choices that blend and meld together.So, Downey Jr and soundtrack/80s LA scene terrific. Everything else ranges from levels of good to mediocrity and once in a while ham-fisted cinematic gesture (such as a death scene I won't mention here).

And that is Robert Downey's performance as the hope to die junkie Julian. His role was comparable to John Travolta's breath taking performance in Saturday Night Fever which was a very good movie. If Less Then Zero was even a halfway decent movie Downey would have gotten a Oscar nomination and the same accolades Travolta got for SNF. It is a tragedy such a great performance is wasted on such a bad movie. I saw the movie last night on the Fox channel and I feel even more stronger about his performance then I did 17 years ago. It was like watching his future in retrospect. Spader was very good playing James Spader, a role he still plays to this day on TV. Jamie Gertz and Andrew McCarthy might as well stayed home because they are just bland and pitiful. MacCarthy comes home for the summer from College and acts like he just landed from Mars. In my experience going to private schools and having friends in which money is not a problem, they just don't mesmerize into party going druggies with nothing to do but spend money over night. Now I am not going to implicate myself, but this partying starts way before getting out of high school. It starts mainly when we got our cars or had friends who had cars. 10th grade for the most part. Also remember it was legal to drink at 18 back then so hanging out at 15 was not a unusual. Where was MacCarthy's at during high school...AlF the Alien would of been a better choice for this part Then we have the Jaimie Gertz character. I am not buying she is a model, I'm not buying it one bit. Why is she still living in LA hanging out with her high school crowd? I mean it might be summer break for the college crowd but it shouldn't be for her, she should be at work! Plus I think she was not the right actress for the role. One of the Bratz Dolls would of done better. I did like Julians father's character though. At least there was a parent in the movie who took notice of his child. He wasn't just fed up with his son and I liked that he was not just letting him do what he was doing. Believe it or not every rich kid doesn't have parents who don't care for them. The movie is like looking at a big MTV video when they played videos. I never read the book so I cannot compare it to the book. But the movie stinks. I have to think if the two leads were not so unsuited for the roles it might have been a little better. But if not for Downey's performance this movie would be forgotten and never seen again except in the 99 cent bin at the local 99 cent store.

Spader might have been acting, but given Downey's later exploits I'm reasonably sure they let him get coked up and let the cameras role.

The director apparently came fromcommercials and it shows- he puts a gloss and a shine on the pools andthe houses and the parties, but deep down you get the feeling he'strying to sell you something you don't really need or want. Stick withthe book, you won't be sorry.

Not just because Robert Downey Jr is one of my favorite actors, but because it is a good movie. The movie starts out at a high school graduation somewhere in the richer part of California.Andrew mcartney, Jami graz and Robert Downey Jr are best friends. AM goes to college,JG becomes a model And RDj tries to start a music career. While Am is gone, JG and RDj hook up and start sleeping together. Around Christmas time, JG calls AM and tells him he needs to come home and help RDj because hes real messed up on drugs and owes some drug dealers some money.She is also on drugs. And from there on you see the hardship of trying to help a loved one get off of drugs. Robert downey jr gives a stunning performance who looses everything because of drugs. He looses his family support, starts prostituting to pay of a drug dealer**MAY BE A SPOILER******and ends in a situation that is a true tear jerker. And thats why i give it a****1/2out of*****DarkChild  "}]
