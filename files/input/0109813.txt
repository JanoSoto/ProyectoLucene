[{"Title":"I had fun, enjoy this for what it is, we don't get many family films like this any more","Date":"3 April 2004","Score":"33 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" The Flinstones, next to The Simpsons, it's one of the best known animated shows of all time, we all know the name Fred Flinstone. It's such a great series, I grew up watching it, I still will catch an episode or two on the Cartoon Network and I'm sure it's something that my children will watch too one day. So in 1994, we had the live action version of The Flinstones come into theaters, my family took me to see it, I was 9 years old, it was either this or Pulp Fiction, I'm sure my parents didn't struggle much with that decision. But still as a kid I absolutely loved this movie, I think I wore out the VHS quite a bit. So I grew up and of course caught the movie on HBO, I figured that I would just give the movie another shot to see if it was still as fun as I remembered and actually I still love it.Cliff Vandercave, the Executive Vice President of Industrial Procurement at Slate & Co., plans to appoint a Vice President of his division to frame for a crime. To find one, he makes an exam to give to the quarry operators, among whom are Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone. Fred loans Barney money so he and his wife, Betty can adopt a child. They adopt a caveboy named Bamm-Bamm. Barney appreciates what Fred did for him and is determined to pay him back. While taking the exams, Fred fails it, and is disappointed since he will not be able to give his wife, Wilma the wealthy life she used to have. Barney takes Fred's exam up for him and notices how poorly he did. To pay him back for giving him the money to adopt Bamm-Bamm, he swaps his exam with Fred's and Fred is promoted to Vice President. Cliff orders Fred to fire Barney because of his exam score, and he fires Barney at the Rubbles' surprise party, but does his best to help Barney afterwards with financial problems. But Cliff still has big plans to set Fred up for a big fall and the Rubbles are starting to get sick of the Flinstone's over the top extravagances.Honestly, I really did enjoy The Flinstones as much as I did when I was a kid, I know the main reason a lot of people complain about this movie is because of the casting, but even with Rosie O'Donnell in it I thought she was adorable, we had a great cast, everyone has their own ideas, but just deal with it and understand who this movie was made for. Granted as an adult I'm not going to go out of my way to watch this movie by myself, but I still wouldn't mind at all showing this to my younger cousins and watching it with them. It has cute jokes, a fun cast, and a good story with tons of fun sets and props. I would recommend this movie to watch with your family if you get the chance, it's a rockin' good time.7/10 "},{"Title":"Excellent Live-Action Cartoon!","Date":"15 January 2003","Score":"36 out of 53 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  I'm rather disappointed to see that this film has such a low rating on IMDb, this film was great!  I was a huge fan of the cartoon back in my childhood and it was great to see the live-action version of the cartoon!  The story is pretty good, although it is obviously directed toward it's child audience, but I still loved it.I can't talk about this movie without talking about the special effects!  They were incredible!!!  Dino looked absolutely spectacular!  As did the other dinosaurs and beasts in the film.  I really liked the sets and the wardrobe as well.  You can tell that a lot of work went into this film and a great deal of thought.The cast was nearly perfect!  John Goodman was just fantastic as Fred Flintstone and was perfect for the part!  Rick Moranis wouldn't have been my first choice for Barney Rubble, but he did a superb job!  I've always liked Rick Moranis, this guy needs to do more films!  Elizabeth Perkins was excellent as Wilma Flintstone, and is quite the looker in the film.  The only complaint I have is Rosie O'Donnell, I'm sorry, but something about her just rubs me the wrong way.  I've never really liked her acting very much, and I don't think she really fit the role of Betty Rubble.  I would have preferred to see someone else in the role.  Kyle MacLachlan was a very good villain and Halle Berry was PERFECT!  Elizabeth Taylor was a nice touch as well, I wouldn't have expected to see her in the film, but she did a very good job.If you like the cartoon, then you should definitely give this a shot.  The comedy was very similar to the television show, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Anyhow, I really enjoyed the film and I hope that you will too.

I don't remember anybody out and out hating it, it just kinda got one of those meh grunts whenever it was mentioned.Now I'm twenty three and I just watched it again and I gotta say, I still think it's pretty damn good. And unless you just simply are not of a fan of the Flintstones cartoons I don't see how you can not like this film. It plays like an extended episode of the series, with a plot not unlike something we have seen in our Saturday morning reruns, but loaded with enough clever one liners and risqu√© humor to elevate it to a much more adult oriented comedy. It's also got tons of sight gags and background jokes that you will likely need some multiple viewings to appreciate. Not to mention the sheer scope and execution of the sets, costumes and animatronic and CG dinosaurs are really something to admire, especially for its day.The actors all play their parts well too, John Goodman and Rick Moranis as Fred and Barney are the standouts but there's nobody here that I thought fell short. Yes, I would have liked to have seen Betty portrayed with somebody with more curves in the right places...I mean she was the hottie in the cartoon and Rosie O'Donnell's physique definitely doesn't live up, but you have to give credit where credit is due and while she may not look quite the same, she plays the part well and has the voice and trademark giggle down perfectly.Is this a fantastic film no...but I enjoy it every time I watch it and I think the attention to detail and obvious care that went into making this movie alone should keep it entertaining for years to come and considering its unlikely anything quite like this will ever be done again outside of its sequels, I would not be surprised if this movie eventually earns its respect among film buffs in the future.

Maybe it's because Hanna & Barbera were involved and were two of the executive producers of the movie as well as having small roles in the production.  Besides this, this classic tale of life in the stone age had tremendous casting in the way of John Goodman(Fred Flintstone), Rick Moranis(Barney Rubbel) and the entire group for that matter.  The movie starts with the Rubbel family adding a new member in the adopted Bam-Bam and then the rest of the movie matches pretty much the way the two families lived their lives & worked together as neighbors in the prehistoric town of Bedrock.  Of course there is evil-a-foot within a demented man in a higher position in the stone quarry who tries to frame Fred and the rest of the movie is a culmination of all this.  What is great about the movie & the series the Flintstones is that no matter what trouble they got in, the families always patched it up in the end showing us what true friends our made of.   And besides all this the movie was funny & visually appealing too !!

The cartoons come to real live and the nostalgia carries some of the film.  However, the paper-thin plot destroys any chance that the film has to be a complete success.  Naive Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) has been promoted and is now a big-time businessman.  Of course the villains, Halle Berry and Kyle MacLachlan, are just using Fred to steal from Mr. Slate's company.  Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins) quickly becomes jealous of Berry, but overlooks everything because Fred is raking in the cash.  Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) meanwhile is unemployed because he had the lowest score on an IQ test (he actually switched tests with Fred because Fred had lent him money to adopt Bamm-Bamm).  Throughout his financial crisis, Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) stands beside him.  Fred finally becomes wise to what is going on, but MacLachlan has a devious scheme up his sleeve.  All in all The Flintstones is a good looking film with high production values, but ultimately the screenplay and direction cannot save this film.  The characters play well on television, but are somewhat out of their element on the big screen.  The cast is hard-working in spite of the fact the material is just not present.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

The world of Bedrock is excitingly captured, all the surrounding details look right, but unfortunately the script is a pale, shapeless mess. Also, who cast Rosie O'Donnell as neighbor Betty Rubble, the Snow White of the Sabertooth set? O'Donnell is far too brash and distracting as Betty, who was mostly around in the TV show as a foil for Fred's wife Wilma (adequately played by Elizabeth Perkins). O'Donnell should have instead played Fred's mother-in-law, although Elizabeth Taylor is game for this loudmouthed harridan.

The special effects and the sets are incredible, they have put a lot of work into making that. Every little detail, that can be seen in the cartoon, is also in this movie, for example a lizard like dinosaur running on a wheel to pull an elevator. However, less work has been done to write the plot, which is somewhat week and full of cliches. John Goodmann makes a great Fred, but Rick Moranis' Barney does not really  resemble Mel Blanc's from the cartoon. I think his laugh is missing, also the general way Mel Blanc's Barney speaks is different. Rosie O'Donnel's Betty, on the other hand, is good. This movie is still a must for any Flinstones fan. The plot is not the most important part of this movie, the way Steven Spielberg made drawings come to live is.

Yes, the plot is predictable and weak, and in some cases over-familiar. Yes, the script is a bit weak in places. Yes, it is a little lacklustre, and doesn't quite capture the feel good nature of the show. But it is far from the worst movie ever. I really don't know what people were thinking when they gave this film such a low rating. Some of the worst movies I've ever seen, are Home Alone 4, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Cat in the Hat, Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Pokemon the First Movie and Batman and Robin, but this film doesn't deserve to belong to this category. On the most part, due to the enthusiastic performances of the cast, it was quite entertaining. John Goodman was born to play Fred. He looks the part, and put a lot of much-needed enthusiasm into the role. Rick Moranis is fine as Barney, very like what I imagine him. The prequel is probably better, but Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin don't quite fit the bill as Goodman and Moranis. I also liked Elizabeth Perkins and Rosie O'Donnell as Wilma and Betty. As the villains, Kyle McLachan and Halle Berry play their clich√©d characters more than adequately. I do miss Elizabeth Taylor when she was pretty, but she was game as Wilma's mother, though not quite in the same league as Joan Collins in the prequel. The sets and costumes are spot on, and the design of Dino was superb. All in all, I liked this movie, it's not perfect, but it is far from the worst movie I have ever seen. 6/10 Bethany Cox.

The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.

Rosie O'Donell as Betty Rubble?! Rosie didn't play Betty very well and she can't even giggle like Betty does! And then there's the animatronic animals. Honestly, I've seen better animatronics at Chuckie Cheese! The Flintstones Movie has never stayed true to the Flintstones cartoon series, the jokes are never original, the cast is all mixed-up, and Rosie O'Donell sucks for the role of Betty Rubble! If I were to invent a time machine, I would've warned the Flintstones that some idiot from Universal is going to make a crappy movie that would nearly destroy the Flintstones franchise.

No one knows what Barney does for a living. The sharp wit of Barney's dialogue was absent, to say nothing of Mel Blanc's characterization. Elizabeth Taylor was too thin to play Mrs. Pebble. (Wilma's maiden name was Pebble. The later episodes of the series forgot this.) Of course, no one could match the great Verna Felton as Fred's mother-in-law, but the writers and Miss Taylor should have tried.

Speaking of which, this explains why The Flintstones is such easy prey to incessant panning &#x96; it's a movie based on a cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, does it work for what it is and the answer is a resounding yes! Movies should be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve. For instance, Godzilla is a colossal-creature movie and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original Apocalypse Now it's dreck, but how does it stack-up to other gigantic-monster movies? It's the same thing with The Flintstones. Roger Ebert criticized the film on the grounds that the story is confusing, not very funny, and kind of odd, given the target audience of younger children and their families. Do kids really care much about office politics, embezzlement, marital problems, difficulties with adoption, aptitude exams and mothers-in-law? For one thing, the film IS funny if you're familiar with The Flintstones and, more so, if you're a fan, which I am. I've seen the movie four times now and, without exception, laughed from beginning to end. Now the laughs may be more giggling at silly humor than uproarious laughter, but laughing nonetheless. As for the criticism that the story's confusing and misses the supposed target audience because of adult-oriented elements, this just shows that the target audience wasn't just kids. The Flintstones is for kids AND adults equally, which was true of the original cartoon as well, but more so with the movie, and I'm glad. The live-action version of Dudley Do-Right (1999) made the mistake of aiming solely for kids &#x96; real little kids -- and it seriously bombed and justifiably so because it's a complete dud. It's impossible to watch that movie as an adult and stay interested. The Flintstones doesn't make this mistake and that's why it was such a hit and remains thoroughly entertaining to this day.The cast is great, even Rosie O'Donnell as Betty (who I didn't think would work), but John Goodman as Fred is so good it's like the cartoon come to life! Furthermore, the sets and F/X are top-of-the line and surprisingly hold up to this day. In addition, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The bottom line is that The Flintstones is entertaining from beginning to end for all the reasons noted above and it wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Sun Valley, California, and Snow Canyon State Park, Utah.GRADE A "},{"Title":"search of childhood's spirit","Date":"16 February 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" it is not a good or a bad movie. it represents only an exercise to remind the flavor of childhood. the result is decent, the cast is not bad, the special effects almost meritorious. something missing and that fact is the shadow who defines the film. for me, the great surprise and the motif to remember the film is the presence of Elisabeth Taylor. it is only cause for remember that comedy because the role of great Liz is marks the end of a glorious career. sure, John Goodman or Rick Moranis are inspired option for the lead roles but the film has not the gift to impress. maybe, only, to resurrect the memories of childhood. a good thing, at first sigh. a film who remember a legendary animation. almost a homage, almost an easy comedy.but nothing more.

The film stars John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Flintstone, and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty Rubble, along with Kyle MacLachlan as an executive-vice president of Fred's company, Halle Berry as his seductive secretary and Elizabeth Taylor, in her final theatrical film, as Wilma's mother.Visually it's impressive, and a lot of the fun things to see are usually little things, often in the background. Goodman is the perfect Fred, whilst Moranis is great as Barney, elsewhere Halle Berry literally steams up the screen she is that hot. Sadly Kyle MacLachlan is in full pantomime villain mode and it's just as well this was Liz Taylor's last movie as she over acts horribly.

"},{"Title":"Dino was the only thing I liked about this movie","Date":"9 February 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" This movie is an attempt to turn a classic cartoon into a live action movie. The question is did it work? I found the Flintstones to be clich√©d, full of shameless advertising which did not work on me, having a very bland and boring plot, and generally I thought it was rubbish. The film was targeted at children, but those of us who grew up with the Flintstones, would have seen this movie for the memories. My comment on this is that I am glad that I waited for it to come on to television. The Flintstones worked as a cartoon, but it does not work as a live action movie.The idea behind the Flintstones is that they are a typical American family living in the stone age. The original creators did this as a parody of the American way of life. The concept was clever and the show was very popular. What the filmmakers have tried to do is to continue this theme and in the movie it does not work. I thought that their attempt to parody the American culture failed abysmally. The worse part was their attempt at doing this with McDonalds. It was supposed to be funny, but I thought that is was a shameless product placement for a place that I detest anyway. In the original cartoons, I thought that the creators taking modern inventions and placing them in the prehistoric setting was clever, here it is not.Turning away from the rubbish that is this movie, I think that there is something that is interesting that appears in the original cartoon as well as here. Remembering that the movie is an attempt to copy the cartoon, the concept is probably not as important here. Everything in the Flintstones is big. With the modern age of miniaturisation, things have become smaller, which means that we have more space for more stuff, but what we see in the Flintstones is a reflection of hyperconsumption. Everything here is much larger than life. Spare ribs are so big that they tip the car over. Families have sabretooth tigers instead of cats, and Pterrodactyls do their business on cars instead of pigeons. The direction of society today is to have more and better things, especially in regards to food. With 60% of Americans on weightloss programs, it is interesting to see how big things in the Flintstones reflect the hyperconsumer of the American way of life.The only thing that I liked about the movie was Dino. He was obviously computer animated, but I thought that they did an incredible job with him. Dino is seriously cool, the huge dog that always jumps on Fred and slobbers all over him. The interaction between Dino and Fred was quite impressive. Other than this, I did not like this movie one bit.

I also first saw this live action movie based on the cartoon when I was nine years old, the year after it came out, and again a few years later, when I was in my very early teens. I'm not sure exactly what I thought the first time, but I clearly remember that I liked it a lot the second time. However, as you grow up, your tastes tend to change, and seeing the low rating for this movie, it doesn't surprise me that I no longer care much for it.Fred Flintstone gives his friend, Barney Rubble money so he and his wife, Betty can afford to adopt a child. Barney is very grateful, and feels he must somehow repay Fred. Soon after this, an exam is held at Slate and Company to determine who is worthy of being the new vice president, and whoever gets the job will become rich. Barney does well on the exam, but Fred does very poorly. When Barney discovers this, he sees it as a good opportunity to try and repay his friend, so he decides to switch the tests. As a result, Fred gets the highest score and becomes the new vice president! However, the proud Flintstone is totally unaware of the fact that he is being used! Cliff Vandercave and Rosetta Stone plan to use money from Slate & Co. to go to Rockapulco, and the whole purpose of the exam was actually to find a scapegoat! Now that Fred is vice president, he will be that scapegoat! Worse still, now that Fred and Wilma are rich, they are not quite the same, and this could mean the end of their relationship with the Rubbles! If you're at all familiar with the cartoon show, you would obviously assume that this movie is a comedy, and it is. However, as such, it fails miserably in my book! I never laughed, and barely even smiled. The only scene that gave me a full smile was the one where Wilma and Betty try to wake up the Dictabird, and he says, No, Mumsie, I don't want to go to school. The other boys make fun of me. I also found Green Jelly's Anarchy in Bedrock (a parody of The Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the U.K.) during the end credits fairly amusing, but I don't know if that counts. Now, this live action adaptation does have an interesting premise, some impressive sets, and a good serious moment here and there. I also think Rick Moranis makes a very good Barney, and certain other cast members fit their roles well. Unfortunately, this is not enough to prevent most of the movie from being dull, with mostly mediocre jokes, as well as some cheesy moments, most notably the scenes where Rosetta Stone flirts with Fred.Without a doubt, some Flintstones fans HATE this movie, or just don't like it. It's common for remakes and movie adaptations of TV shows to disappoint many fans, and this 1994 Flintstones movie is no exception. If you ask me, this is one of those movies that was aimed at kids, and doesn't have a lot for those outside that targeted audience. So, I guess I recommend it for kids who want an amusing adventure, but for adults, whether you're a Flintstones fan or not, I wouldn't get my hopes up. After watching this first live action adaptation of the cartoon again, it certainly hasn't made me feel desperate to watch the apparently inferior The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, a prequel to this movie released in 2000, which features a totally different main cast.

Even the kids come across as convincing versions of the animated characters, which is totally amazing!Of course the most outstanding element of this movie is the magnificent production design, art direction, and other elements that make the recreation of a 20th century-style Stone Age very involving to hang the story on.But as I said before, what I really like about this movie is the excellent deadpan comic style, which up to that time hadn't been effectively presented for a long time (certainly not in Hollywood productions anyway). The general feeling at the time was that 80s-90s big budget Hollywood couldn't handle satirical or farcical comedy very well. The wit got lost in the mix. And Steven Spielburg proved them wrong.

While the movie atmosphere (i.e. the set design) can be really amusing, there's still something lacking in terms of the script. One problem that The Flintstones seems to have is that it apparently derived a majority of its material from episodes of the show.  The humor itself is really one-note as it spends most of its time showcasing the special effects, mild moments of slapstick, and recreating certain gags from the show (e.g. the tip-toe sound effects during a bowling game and scenes from the opening and closing credits).  It's fine if the movie was trying really hard to pay a homage to the show for which it's based on but the script doesn't really do much to greatly enhance the material.  The humor probably works the best when it takes something from the present and slightly twist it.  Although the story is perhaps too simple and ultimately predictable, it's somewhat understandable since it is after all based on a cartoon.

Four years earlier, the Jetsons had their own movie. It was animated, because I guess to do a live action Jetsons proved difficult back then, but the Flintstones live-action would be easy, so Steven Spielrock made it in 1994.          Fred had given money to Barney and Betty so they could adopt a baby. They get Bamm-Bamm. A tough child, always carries a club, and doesn't talk, just says his name. The Rubbles painstakinglyget used to him. That night, Fred and Barney go bowling and Barney says he'll pay Fred back someday, somehow. The words really touched Fred.          When Fred get's home, his mother in-law is there and insults him, like usual. Fred is determined to be a somebody someday.He soon get's the chance when his work, Slate & Company, gives aptitude tests to the employees to determine which one of them is fit to be an executive. Fred takes the test and does poorly, but Barney did very well and remembering his words of paying Fred someday and somehow, so he switches tests and soon Fred is crowned the new Vice President. Next day, he's shown to his new office by an evil executive, Cliff Vandercave. He also meets his sexy new secretary, MissSharon Stone. Fred's office also contains a Dictabird, a bird who memorizes every word said around it; Cliff also wants to make sure Fredwill do whatever he tells him to, so he tells Fred to fire Barney, whoreportidly did the worst on the aptitude tests, when Fred declines,Cliff threatens to fire both of them. So Fred does the deed...During aparty Barney and Betty threw for him. They even gave him a nice newbriefcase.          Financial troubles get to the Rubbles, so Wilma invites them to live with them until they're back on their feet. Barney get's a job at Chevroc gas station, and even becomes a crash test dummy. Fred, meanwhile, hits upon million dollar decisions, for example, Cliff shows all the executives the future. A steam powered machine that would do all the labor. It was a model of the macinery, there was also a model house that made Fred wonder, who's going to live in those small houses? Cliff has also been playing Fred for a fool, making him sign documents without reading them, then gives Fred a huge $$$ bonus. So Fred trades in his Flintmobile for a new La Sabretooth and remodels the house; Fred and Barney's friendship comes to an end and Fred finds out not only was he an embezzler, but he also inadvertantly fired everyone from the company and those ex-employees want to see him hung. Barney shows up and inadvertanly confessed it was his fault, so he too was at the end of his rope. Literally. Wilma and Betty take the Dictabird from Fred's office, for evidence that proves Fred's innocence. When the Flintstones and Rubbles return home, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are gone. They were kidnapped by Cliff.         They go to the quarry at dawn to face him and the new machinery. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm were about to be made into stone blocks.Barney tries to rescue them and Fred bowls down Cliff with a rock used as a bowling ball. The machine leaks alot of water that mixes with rocks and it all tumbles down the hill and lands on Cliff. Thus the creation of concrete. Mr. Slate loved the idea and Cliff Vandercave was no more.         Very good idea for a movie. It was followed by a sappy sequel!John Goodman is a terrific Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis was a great Barney, Elizabeth Perkins was a good Wilma, and Rosie O'Donnell gave a real edge to Betty Rubble. Watch for creators William Hanna andJoseph Barbera in the movie. William Hanna is in the boardroom, he's the guy that says Steam! He's a mad man!. Joe Barbera, I don't know what scene he's in. He's credited as Man in Mersandes.Jean Vander Pyl (voice of Wilma on the cartoon) plays Mrs. Feldspar. She's dancing behind Dino in the congo line. Anyway, see this movie whenever you can!!

Nothing is sacred! Brian Levant's The Flinstones follows a plethora of animated features cum screen sensations from Batman to the other recent Hanna and Barbera production, The Jetsons.Though that well loved space age family did maintain its animated status, the modern stone age family was not as fortunate. John Goodman, reputedly at the insistence of Steven Spielberg, got the choice role of Fred, the great big lovable oaf who has a heart that's every bit as soft as his head. Elizabeth Perkins plays stern wife Wilma, Rick Moranis is old pal Barney Rubble, and comedienne Rosie O'Donnell (A League of Their Own) is Barney's wife Betty.While everybody looks the part, and no expense has been spared in re-creating Bedrock, none of the characters are ever interesting enough to hold your attention for more than ten minutes. The cartoon-esqe plot, with villains Cliff Van der Cave (Kyle MacLachlan) and sidekick secretary Stone (Halle Berry) framing Fred for embezzling, is painfully stretched out for ninety or so minutes with the assistance of a subplot involving the Rubbles' adoption of a darling little Neanderthal named Bamm-Bamm. In fact the only interesting and genuinely entertaining character is Fred's talkative piece of office equipment, the Dictabird (voiced by Harvey Korman).All this is not to say that Brian Levant has let us down, as he has been very true to the original 60's cartoon series, and both Jim Henson's creature creations and William Sandell's production design are a credit to their collective geniuses. However there is very little one can do with a show that was never really meant to leave the T.V. set.I guess the novelty wears off all too quickly, unless you're a Flinstones freak or a minor. Look out for cult rock group the B-52's, appearing as the BC52's.

John Goodman is an ideal Fred and there are tons of great prehistoric gags on modern pop culture (Rock-Donalds, Tar Wars, Universe-Shell, Steven Spiel-Rock, etc) and great lines (I think my bronto-crane's pregnant again. I tell ya, you forget to lock her up one Saturday night...). But at the same time, the film becomes unnecessarily mean spirited as the plot unfolds and the morality tale is put into effect.An ambitious cave man executive, played by a sneering Kyle Dune McLaughlan, at the quarry where Fred and Barney (Rick Moranis) work tries to engineer a plan to make off with a lot of money and the quarry itself in shambles with a lot of the workers out of business by getting one of them promoted to an executive's position so he can manipulate him. He holds an IQ test and guess what, Fred wins. However, Fred only wins because Barney switched their tests as a thank you to Fred for loaning him the money to adopt little Bam-Bam. Barney's well intentioned good deed later comes back to bite him in the ass when Fred is forced by Kyle to fire him for allegedly scoring the lowest on the test. Barney, Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) and little Bam-Bam are forced to move in with Fred, Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins), little Pebbles and Dino after Bam-Bam trashes a crystal exhibit while Betty & Wilma are out shopping and the Rubbles credit card is deemed no good.Like all blue collar working men who finally get that big break, Fred wants to do some good for the workers, but both he and Wilma are slowly corrupted by the size of his new bank account and they become snobs while Barney searches for work. After Fred is tricked into firing all the workers so that new machinery meant to replace them can be installed, an enraged Barney tells Fred the truth and then he walks out with Betty and Bam-Bam. Wilma also leaves Fred, trashes all the stuff he bought and takes Pebbles to go and live with her mother (ideally played by Elizabeth Taylor). Divided, Fred returns to his old self as he begins to long for his family and friends, and is then forced to go on the run when Kyle frames him for embezzling. When Wilma catches wind of this, she and Betty (who has temporarily left Barney while he works selling snow cones) go to the office and steal the dicta-bird with the hope of using the bird to clear Fred's name. Fred is hunted down and nearly lynched by the angry workers, and so is Barney when he shows up with his snow cones and reveals that it was all because he switched the tests. Fred & Barney make up, but just as they're about to be lynched (You'll have plenty of time to bond in the after life! shouts Richard Moll) Wilma & Betty show up with the bird and the bird reveals the truth after Fred apologizes to him.When they return to the home of Wilma's mom, they find the mom and Dino all tied up and Pebbles & Bam-Bam kidnapped by Kyle, who demands the Dicta-Bird in exchange for the kids. Fred & Barney go to the quarry and try to rescue the kids, which they manage to do and thwart Kyle in the process with a little bowling prowess and destroy Kyle's machines in the process, while Kyle himself is buried in concrete! Mr. Slate, the owner of the quarry, offers Fred an even better job as a reward for creating concrete, but Fred declines and asks instead that he begin back his old job and his old life along with a few more perks for the re-hired working men (health care, paid vacations, little packets of ketchup in the lunch room, etc).Something of a mixed bag, and that's a shame considering that it sticks a lot closer to its source than the live action Scooby Doo films (not that I dislike the Scooby films).

The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either.The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble.

Of course not. Any movie that expects us to laugh at or with Rosie O'Donnell and Liz Taylor (ironically, the only genuine-looking large lizards) is doomed from the start. Not to mention that even as a kid I'd considered nearly all Hanna-Barbera cartoons as vastly inferior to Disney, Warner Brothers, MGM and others.In a sense, though, the movie was better than I'd expected I'd foreseen giving a 0/10 film but ended up dishing out a generous 1/10 rating instead. Naturally, this is only due to IMDb's rating system. IMDb is to blame that I can't allocate the appropriate number to this utterly useless pile of comedic debris. Normally I'm quite content with the 1 as the lowest rating &#x96; given that even a 3 signifies horse-manure - but I can't get rid of this ugly feeling of insulting all the 1-rated movies by giving this bull-manure a number larger than Nirvana.TF is fascinating though. It is absolutely fascinating how a bunch of Hollywood dummies managed to get together and get EVERYTHING wrong. (Not that any film-maker could have made a good live-action movie out of the The Flintstones; this was CLEARLY mission impossible.) No aspect of this embarrassing comedy had not been brought down to the level of a school play from the mostly abysmal casting to the grotesque/ugly (as opposed to cute) creatures to the unsuitable story-line to the cringe-worthy Porky's-level humour; this mega-turkey flops on every conceivable level.Supply and demand&#x85; corporate embezzlement&#x85; street protests&#x85; Did I dream it? How many kids understand these terms? There is even a lynch mob scene, complete with a noose is this the stuff of family pictures? I admit that my last viewing of the TV show was back when I was around 8, but I don't recall any episodes in which Wall Street terminology was being thrown around. Clearly, some money-obsessed Hollywood yuppie must have written this script, completely neglecting to consider themes and topics that kids are interested in and familiar with. Even the B-grade writers who concocted all those inferior stories in the overrated TV original knew better than to make corporate fraud the central premise of a dumb lowest-common-denominator caveman comedy. That Spielberg would actually OK this plot &#x96; plus the totally irrational casting of Rosie as Betty &#x96; speaks volumes about what an overrated film-maker he is.Then again, TF isn't really a family picture. Usage of the term family picture presupposes that adults can enjoy the movie as well as kids. Speaking of which, TF isn't for kids either; I doubt there are many 5 year-olds daft enough to laugh at this uninspired collection of bargain-basement gags. No; even they are too old for this crap. The only demographic group that might be suitable for this garbage is infants. They fulfill all the criteria 1) their brains are light-years from being on par even with Sean Penn; 2) they haven't yet opened their eyes which spares them the badness of the visual gags &#x96; especially the incessant mugging; 3) they don't yet understand English which spares them the anguish of hearing and understanding all the awful dialog. Infants are almost ideally suited as an audience for trash such as this.The only way this forgettable franchise could have been transplanted onto the big screen with any measure of non-badness would have been to do it as an absurdist comedy in the ZAZ vein. Even then it would have been a tall order, even for the best writers, to make it work. But for the WORST Hollywood writers this was a ridiculously impossible task. Nevertheless, this pile of chicken droppings managed to rake in tons of money at the box-office, reminding us that idiocracy didn't start in this century.As of this writing, I've seen around 800 comedies.

Even Jack Black fumbling about in a wrestling ring becomes high art next to John Goodman going ya-ba-dubba-doo.

My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult was an excellent choice for this film.I wish there was a way to post a comment without rambling on and on about how great or terrible the movie is. If it was a mediocre movie it deserves a mediocre comment. Goodman is great, as he usually is. He always reminded me of Fred Flintstone, so yeah, he was well cast. Rosie O'Donnell sucks, but I can't think of a better Betty Rubble. The cartoons are much better than this movie though. Its just not the same without the cartoon voices, it just isn't the same. If you were or still are a fan of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, this movie probably isn't for you. It's a lot like how Hollywood ruined Scooby-Doo for me, although that didn't happen for another 10 years. Meh, yabba dabba doo! its the Flintstones.

A reminder of a younger, some would say simpler time in my life.  This movie, on the other hand, is a reminder of a younger, some might say less intelligent time in my life.  I watched this movie tonight for the first time in about six or seven years.  First of all, I don't know how Halle Berry went from this movie to an Oscar winning actress.  As far as the story goes, there are not really any complaints.  Its expected to be simple, and I can respect that.  The problem with this movie, which is essentially eye candy(well it was back then), is the acting.  John Goodman, who has made some fine turns in films like Fallen and The Big Lebowski, is just bad.  It seems to me that he is doing his best Jackie Gleason impression, and its really not all that good.  Rosie O'Donnell gives a stiff, and yet somehow melodramatic performance.  Don't ask me how thats possible.  Rick Moranis is just annoying as Barnie.  Elizabeth Perkins is extremely one dimensional and fails to capture the fire of a cartoon character.  In all fairness, this is also the fault of bad direction.  All in all, I'm glad I'm older now because I can see the errors of my ways, and the errors of others ways as well.  If you're over six, avoid this movie like the plague because its just bad.  4 out of 10.

Obviously made to cash in on Baby Boomer sentiments. Lacks all the fun and humor of the cartoon, and goes on way too long. This sitcom format is rarely sustainable for more than standard 30 or 60 minutes shows. THE FLINSTONES wears out its welcome after the beginning musical score. The script is unfunny, predictable and dull. John Goodman is an exceptional actor, yet he can't save this turkey. Kids will be bored, and those who remember the original with any fondness, will likely get depressed.

I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes clich√©, and its characters bland and one dimensional.The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life.The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant.Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all clich√© best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns.The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002.The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas.Starring John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by Brian Levant.

Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more. Maybe lots of those 358.5M are because people couldn't believe that they had made a bad movie about a family that generations have grown with. I expect something better with the prequel that is coming out this summer even though I don't think the people they chose to be the new Flintstones look like them as the first cast did.

An early victim was The Flintstones, a failed experiment that should have told them not to do any more of these.Quite simply, this movie stinks like a pile of dinosaur droppings.The original cartoon poked innocent fun at mainstream America, creatively clothing it with prehistoric costumes and primitive technology, focusing on an everyday family and putting them in wild situations. Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty were all likable, and we laughed at Fred's ridiculous schemes and the chaotic outcomes.The spirit of the cartoon is non-existent here. The characters just argue, screw up, argue some more, screw up some more. People lie, cheat, and back stab. Everyone is boorish and mean; and just make you angry. The script goes nowhere, in story or comedy. Jokes don't work--come to think of it, were there any jokes even in this thing? Or any comedy at all? Wait One (and only one) thing was funny--Rosie O'Donnell had the Betty Rubble snicker down. That's it.John Goodman, Rick Moranis, and Elizabeth Perkins (all normally good comic actors) seem lost in this primeval slop. As for some other actors in the cast, they were so obnoxious I was hoping a pterodactyl would sweep them up and toss them into a tar pit somewhere.If Early Man was like this, no wonder Neanderthals went extinct.

This is actually an entertaining and amazing looking movie.Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gets a promotion at work when Barney (Rick Moranis) switches tests with Fred and Wilma (Elizibeth Perkins) previously helped him and Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) adopt their child Bam Bam. Fred gets tricked and ends up being in debt and becoming an outlaw. It sounds stupid, and it is, but it's really a fun movie. The sets are amazing, and the best part is, instead of computer animation taking over, most of these awesome sets were actually built. Even the dinosaurs, excluding Dino at times, are animatronics. The acting is OK, not great, mainly because of which actors portray which characters. Barney on the cartoon was supposed to be a husky little guy, and Rick Moranis was in no way fat. Betty was supposed to be petite, and Rosie O'Donnell was terrible casting, and she gives an odd, bad performance. But other than that, this is a fun, great looking movie.My rating *** out of ****. 92 mins. PG for mild language.

I was never a big fan of The Flintstones, but the show did have charm, and was decent children's entertainment. This doesn't, and it isn't. The film starts off with a poorly acted scene that acts as a prologue to the film itself and sets the tone nicely. That means that if you're considering watching this movie, just watch the scene preceding the credits and you can make up your mind on whether or not you want to sit through the rest of this. It acts as a fair warning to even the most overbearing parent. As soon as this scene is over, we get a live-action version of the famous and well-known intro to the TV-series which will make even the most mentally hardened die-hard fan break down in tears and yell Please make it stop! Oh my gosh! at the screen. The film ends with a live-action re-enactment of the end credits sequence of the show as well, which most likely will bring forth the same reaction. I'm not going to lie to you; I didn't pay that much attention to the film. It might have been because I saw it once when I was a kid (almost ten years ago). But, more likely, it was just because it was really dull and downright offensive to anyone who is/was a fan of the show, even slightly, or anyone who actually does demand just a little quality from a film they watch. It's so tacky and crude. Honestly, I couldn't tell you one single joke or gag from the movie, and I've just seen it. My mind, my very subconscious represses it, pushes the memory of the film away from the surface... and you know what? I'm thankful for that. No one should have to see this film. No one. It might have a good effect as a torture device, but that's it. Now, to break it down just quickly for you The plot is dull, pointless, completely predictable(in fact, almost painfully so). The pacing is awful. For a movie that's only 90 minutes, it certainly felt much, much longer. The acting isn't all bad, but it certainly isn't impressive. The characters are cheap clich√©s and stereotypes, mere cardboard cutouts of their characters from the original TV-series. The special effects are so see-through and poorly done that you have to wonder what the heck the film-makers were thinking... if they were thinking at all. Maybe that's it. They slept through the whole thing, and wound up with a bunch of finished film, had it edited by a man with two broken arms and sent it off to the cinemas. I recommend this film only to children, as no adult could possibly be forgiving enough and so indifferent to quality that he or she could actually enjoy even part of this film. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Unmitigated crap.....","Date":"15 February 2001","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  The worst movie I have ever seen - simple as that.

I've heard of despicable adaptations, but The Flintstones is a level all on its own! Featuring Fred (John Goodman) becoming an executive while slimy deals are going on, the movie makes you feel like you died and went to the hottest part of Hell. Worse still, this God-awful excuse for a movie started a trend of dreadful movie adaptations of TV shows Mission Impossible, Lost in Space (although the show apparently sucked to begin with), The Avengers, The Mod Squad, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Scooby Doo, I Spy, The Honeymooners (although the show apparently sucked to begin with) and Bewitched; it's a pure fluke that the movie versions of The Addams Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Brady Bunch and Charlie's Angels were worth watching (although the same can't always be said for sequels my dad saw Charlie's Angels Full Throttle on an airplane and called it one of the ten worst movies that he'd ever seen). To add insult to injury, there was that Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (which, thankfully, I never saw); John Waters's Cecil B. Demented made a joke about it.All in all, this just may be the worst movie ever. I know that it's hard to say, given that there are so many bad movies, but it's certainly up there. They wasted the talents of Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Halle Berry, Kyle MacLachlan, and Jonathan Winters. And how did Elizabeth Taylor end up this swill? Not that she was one of the greatest actresses to begin with.In conclusion, I hear that they're making a Get Smart movie with Steve Carell. I guess that we should keep an open mind, but there's more reason to be suspicious than to be anticipatory. And furthermore, THERE HAD BETTER NOT BE MOVIE VERSIONS OF I Love Lucy, Mister Ed, Gilligan's Island, I Dream of Jeannie, The Flying Nun, All in the Family, Sanford and Son, Happy Days, and Three's Company! At least The Andy Griffith Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show are named after people, and thus can't get all fouled up on the silver screen. "}]
