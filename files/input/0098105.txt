Oh, and the city's under siege because of them. I know this is slapstick and it was never intentioned to be taken seriously, but even when writing a film like this you have to TRY, at least TRY to write something good!!Anyway, the cast is all here, again, and they're not unlike the line of lower-income, shady low-lifes I see waiting outside the Department of Labor office every morning to pick up their unemployment checks. I don't think these guys even bother auditioning for other parts anymore, they're all blacklisted for life. There's Lt. Harris, once funny and a believable antagonist, now a cartoonish straight man to his bumbling apprentice Proctor, the two of them like some ill-fated and painfully unfunny Abbot & Costello bit that goes on too long. Way, way, waaaaay too long. There's Hightower, for the sixth time, he's big and black. Really big and black. Ha-ha-ha. Hooks and Tackleberry are here, oh Lord, don't forget about Hooks and Tackleberry...she's mousy and timid but sometimes she yells loudly, and T-man, he's a walking arsenal who loves guns! Most interesting though is Nick McCoy (I can't remember the character name) who's simply a modern replacement for Steve Guttenberg and his Carey Mahoney. Both are bright-eyed and boyish, both the unofficial leader of the gang. Put all these guys together and you have...well, you have...you have a cast, I guess.Police Academy 6 should have been the end. The sad, painful end to a once respectable series (meaning the first P.A. only) that had gone on seemingly forever, like that old uncle who lives in Jersey who's 103 and can't walk or talk, just lays in bed and mumbles in pain with everyone waiting for him to pass on and finally be at peace. Instead, a seventh police academy was made. It never made it to the theaters and I have yet to see it, but I remember seeing its preview in the movies some years back...as soon as the title and Robert Folk's Academy March started, a universal groan filled the theater. I think the marketing execs were in that theater and got the idea. But don't worry, Academy fans, I'm sure there'll be an eighth and a ninth, and a tenth...it will outlive us all, this series.

But bad jokes is where I draw the line.","Date":"17 April 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Like the last movie, Police Academy 6 starts out with Harris and Proctor on some ridiculous mission to outsmart the rest of the crew and ensure that they get all of the glory for something or other. At least this time they're not breaking and entering like they were in the last movie, but have stationed them on a stake-out at a location that they are sure is going to be the next hit for the dreaded Wilson Heights Gang who, if nothing else, should definitely find someone else to come up with a threatening name so they'll sound more like a group of hardcore criminals and less like a gated community. But in other news, Harris is in charge of his own precinct now, Tackleberry's got a son, and some old characters like Mrs. Feldman and Fackler are back. I have to admit that I am still confused by feelings of reminiscence for Mahoney, not the least reason for which is that, believe it or not, this is the first genuinely stupid entry in the entire series. Yeah, they're slapstick comedies, but my god, how many decades have people been splitting their sides watching slapstick comedies? You could argue that the slapstick was the first real narrative story-telling that came along in film, and the Police Academies are no different, they just haven't stood up to the test of time so well.Oh, and they're also hampered by stupid-ass sequels like this one and the next one. And hopefully not part 8 which, at this point, remains theoretical.So what's going on this time? We have another small group of mind-bogglingly stupid bad guys, which is not a bad thing in itself, but apparently someone took my words too seriously when I originally reviewed Police Academy 5 and said that the movies are essentially kid's movies, because in this installment we get a cartoonish villain that is a bizarre combination of the Wizard of Oz and Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget. I guess I should be more careful what I say when I review movies.On the other hand, the first time I ever reviewed Police Academy 5 was about 22 minutes ago, so there is some legitimacy to the theory that it couldn't have affected the thought patterns of screenwriters Neal Israel and Pat Proft, who wrote Police Academy 6 back in the late 80's. But you never know. But get this, here's the supervillain's scheme &#x96; he plans to use his henchmen to raise the crime rate in a certain strategic location in order to drive down property values, then he'll buy up all the property himself, see that the crime rate goes back down and the property values up, and then live like a king off the interest or whatever for the rest of his life. Actually, when you think about it, that's not the dumbest plot pattern. In fact, compared to how moronic the rest of the movie is, it's not that bad. At least they didn't have a villain who tried to outdo even the most outlandish 007 villains and like, you know, hold the sun for ransom or something.Again, most of the original cast is back, but I still miss Mahoney and Zed, and the screenwriters (yeah, it took more than one to come up with this thing) unfortunately have no idea what to do with the characters that we've come to know and love laughing at. Everyone is undercover and their ridiculous assignments are supposed to generate automatic laughs from us, but worst of all, some of the scenes are such disassociated skits from the plot that the story as a whole falls apart. For example. in one attempt to get into a public place and question the public about the whereabouts of the criminals and whatnot, Jones, Calahan and Hooks go into a bar, where Jones puts on a show for all the barflies doing a brilliant impression of Jimi Hendrix to the delight of the crowd and then they leave without having learned or even trying to learn anything. But at least it's in keeping with the rest of the movie, which is the first tremendous step down into the depths of idiocy in the entire series. If you thought any of the previous movies were stupid, MAN you're gonna love this one! But I do have to say that, like part 5, there are some moments in this one that I distinctly remember loving to death when I was about ten years old, like the scene where the huge bad guy who looks like a lumberjack comes outside with an ice-cream cone with like eight scoops of ice cream stacked up on it and goes, Oh BOY! but then takes one lick, pushing it off where it lands with an audible splat on the pavement and he goes, Crapola!Okay, so it's not funny in writing. Sue me. But show me a ten year old kid who doesn't laugh at that and I'll show you a kid with some developmental problems that far exceed any of the time-wasting nonsense in this movie. By the way, as I mentioned in my review of part 5, make sure to watch the little reminiscent documentary that you'll find on the DVD, it might be funnier than anything in the whole movie! Check this out, besides glorifying the movie like it's some overlooked Oscar winner, director Peter Bonerz (my god, can you imagine having THAT name in junior high school?) lists off the numerous references and homaaaaaages that can be found within its pristine contents, including everything from Orson Welles to Hitchcock himself!Sadly, your brain has to be securely in the off position in order to enjoy the movie, but it may add to the comedy just to know that some effort was put in to put those references in there!!

Over the years I've possibly seen all of the Academy franchise, but never in order. So coming to this one fresh I felt like I was missing out on all the finely tuned story arcs and character development. Like how did the guy who makes sound effects with his mouth all the time go to just making sound effects quite a lot? And what caused the dizzy, shouty one to change to a dizzy one who sometimes only talks loudly?As this was made in the tail end of the 80s the dodgy politics that plagued the early ones are thankfully absent, and there's a better atmosphere too. Okay, Steve Guttenberg no longer being in it automatically takes the smugness level down 50%, but years of critical slating have lent humility to the cast. There's a real air of so bad it's good playing here, rather than the first few where the actors seemed to genuinely believe they had decent material.But it's not all positive, and the absence of other cast members is a worry. Didn't there use to be someone funny in Police Academy? Maybe I imagined it. Still, the loss of Bobcat Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinksy is something to be noted, and we're left with a pretty asinine bunch. Possibly the worst is Bruce Mahler as Fackler, an accident-prone cop instigating wearily mistimed and predictable slapstick sequences.What's great about the Police Academy series is how it unites everyone - the humour is so low-brow that even really thick people don't find it funny. I did get a few ironic laughs at how poor some of it was - like Harris running when his feet are stuck through the bottom of a moving van. Generally, though, it's of the strictly lame variety.There are people that could make it work - think of Chaplin, Laurel, Lloyd or Allen superglued to a chair and, even though it's a cheap gag, you might laugh. But when it's G.W.Bailey directed by Peter Bonerz you're talking a chuckle vacuum.There's a scene where the blue-eyed boring one and the silly noises one enter a Comedy Pub to quieten it down after a blackout. In a scene of pure wish-fulfilment, Michael Winslow gets on the stage and brings the house down. Yeah, right... if only. His Hendrix impression is good, mind. He gets one of the big finales, too, slugging it out with a villain while he does his badly dubbed Bruce Lee schtick. How many times has he done that anyway? Surely even his own mother wasn't laughing at this stage.However, the semblance of some sort of plot and the presence of three genuine laughs - more than in all the other Police Academy movies stuck together - take this one up to a mighty 3/10.

With the earlier sequels, I've been surprised, with all the low ratings, I still was laughing at the movies, just because I think people were taking the movies too seriously or comparing too much to the original Police Academy. Now the last Police Academy may not have had Mahony, Steve Guttenberg's character, but it still made me laugh, but I miss the old gang, they were what made the sequels a lot of fun. I also once again missed Zed and Sweetchuck, certain characters just made these movies into fun comedies, but City Under Siege tries too hard.The class is back together to save the city from jewelery thieves, but the plot thickens when they find out that the leader of the gang is connected with the police. But of course Harris is after all the credit of making the bust on the jewelery thieves and taking the credit, even by mocking the old class that always pull something over their heads. But they find out that there is something deeper than just having the jewels, the thieves are going to own this town unless the police academy stops them.Police Academy 6 City Under Siege still delivers some really good laughs here and there, you always have to love the pranks the class pulls on Harris, G.W. Baily plays them off so well and makes the memorable. Also you have to love Bubba Smith who is the classic big guy you just don't wanna mess with. But as far as the sequels go, this was without a doubt the weaker, from what I understand Mission in Moscow is the worst, so I'm going to do my best to have faith and just hope the series ends with a bang. Police Academy 6 City Under Siege, I recommend it if you are looking to see the series, but as a comedy, it's just alright.3/10 "},{"Title":"Not Quite as Good as the First Two Movies in the Series","Date":"5 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" With a huge crime wave gripping the city the Mayor (played by Kenneth Mars) has decided to task Commissioner Lassard (George Gaynes) with the mission to catch those responsible. Naturally, he then turns to his most trusted police officers who have helped him out on so many missions before. Unfortunately, Captain Harris (G. W. Bailey)--who happens to be in charge of the precinct where most of these crimes are occurring--doesn't especially like the fact that an outsider like Commissioner Lassard has taken over. That being said, Captain Harris therefore has no intention of cooperating unless absolutely forced to do so. Yet, while Commissioner Lassard may have no idea of how troublesome Captain Harris can be, those officers loyal to the Commissioner understand only too well and fully realize that they will have two challenges facing them&#x97;the crooks and some in their own department. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film pretty much reused the same old gags of the previous 5 movies in the series with the only exception being that a couple of them had slightly more depth. For example, one specific scene involving Officer Jones (Michael Winslow) doing an imitation of Jimi Hendrix was especially humorous. Even so, the fact of the matter is that this particular film still wasn't quite as good as the first two movies in the series and for that reason I have rated it as slightly below average.

This time its a gang that are on a crime spree and its up to our boys n girls in blue to save the day. Naturally someone is behind this whole operation so be prepared for a truly ball bustin' twist...nah not really.Yet again I am amazed at the continuity of these films and the fact all of the cast are still present and correct...bar Guttenberg who went AWOL after number four. This time round we have all the regular officers plus Fackler makes a welcome return and Nick Lassard is still here replacing Mahoney.First time ever we actually have a PA film where there aren't any training sequences, this time its all about the main team going up against a trio of super criminals. The criminals are actually quite good too I might add, totally clichéd of course but they are meant to be equals for three of the main PA characters. One guy is a huge bald fat biker looking dude, his strength is errr...strength, so he goes up against Hightower. Then we have a slim athletic guy who is good at martial arts and gymnastics, guess who he goes up against. And finally a smooth well dressed ladies man type who is a sharp shooter and dead eye with guns...yep, Tackleberry.This film relies more on bumbling cops n robbers type of stuff, Harris and Proctor getting set up and constantly missing the chance to make a simple arrest. Not so many pranks, nudity or rudeness, just simple childish 'Pink Panther' styled buffoonery but more idiotic and predictable if that's possible.Kenneth Mars tries to liven up the film with his cartoonish Mayor character but it falls flat. You can see they are trying to capture the madness he brought to 'Young Frankenstein' but it just doesn't work, too stupid and not funny. I did like Gerrit Graham as the aptly named Ace (the sharp shooter criminal) and the little showdown between the three criminals and three officers, the best bit in the film really. Bailey does well again as Harris but the few pranks are way too infantile this time.Over all its not a bad film really, its still better than number four and about on par with number five. I do like the darkly lit, noir- ish visuals they attempt in this one, clearly going for that Bogart-like detective quality in places. The whole thing is actually more akin to a typical pulp comic book adaptation, along the lines of 'Dick Tracy' or 'The Shadow'...albeit a very dumb simplified version.

Part 7, probably, but this is an improvement over part 5, and a genuine attempt to get back to the origins of the series, that which made it so popular and funny. A trio of criminals are causing havoc in the city, stealing diamonds and outwitting the cops at every turn. It seems they are working for a criminal mastermind who plans to lower property prices for his own eventual gains. The cops along with Lassard, Harris and Proctor try to uncover the crooks and work out who the mastermind is.This film has many more funny moments than 5 and 7, and the characters get a chance to fully exploit their individual traits, juxtaposed against the 3 criminals. Nick Lassard returns, but still he is no match for Mahoney. The three criminals are pretty good, and provide a few good moments. Once again it is Harris, Proctor and Lassard who shine, but the rest of the recruits seem more interested than they did in 5. Fackler returns to add some more humour, and overall the film is funny. Of course if you don't like this sort of thing, there is little to recommend it. It is less childish than 5 and 7, there are better performances, and the plot is more linear, rather than seeming like a series of sketches. That said, most of the humour is slapstick, sight gags which have been done better before. However, fans of the series will enjoy it, and remember it is meant to be stupid, not meant to be a cinematic or artistic masterpiece. People reviewing this usually use it to let out all their venom as it is an easy scapegoat. Well, just calm down and save your venom for part seven. Or even better, save it for a film which should have been good, one made with artistic merit in mind which fails. Like Fight Club...

It's good-natured, goofy, cheap and cheerful, the score is jolly, and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves. I can't believe it. Wow.The revolutionary concepts introduced to the series include such formula breakers as a plot with a beginning, middle and end; jokes that build, that go somewhere; punchlines; decent timing; a fair amount of charm; and even variations on the same old characters. I've got a soft spot for this movie as it FINALLY makes good on whatever potential was previously buried beneath an avalanche of failed skits, charmless characters and poorly staged slapstick.'Police Academy 6' (6!) doesn't stray far from the formula of Captain Harris (good old G.W Bailey) falling prey to various pranks as he tries to discredit Commandant Lassard's team, but it's a silly, likable film. I laughed when Harris has his ass glued to a chair, waddles down a corridor, and suddenly sits down whenever someone passes by, as if he'd been sitting there all along. I laughed at the cheap chair-falls-to- pieces gag. I laughed when Lassard nods off as the plot is explained to him. I laughed at Jones's malfunctioning robot. God help me.I laughed at the antics of the criminal gang our heroes are trying to apprehend. I laughed more than once, do you understand? The gang is bossed around by a hidden Mr. Big, who specialises in making menacing pronouncements while his minions chuckle and snigger. I laughed. In one scene they squirt each other with water pistols until Mr. Big confiscates them with 'You can have them back after the crime wave!' I laughed. I laughed at Mr. Big's hat getting blown off when he lights an exploding cigar. I laughed at Gerrit Graham, criminally underused ever since 'Used Cars'.

Now before I get too carried away, I should make it clear that those are pretty much all the good jokes. Many others fall flat, most of them are familiar.

Police Academy 6 is so bad, that you would rather vomit the contents of your stomach than watch the movie. The plot is so un-connected, and the movie so ridiculously unfunny, it makes you cringe.Was there a plot? A story? Anything even like that? Well, yes there was. Three guys, considered a gang, somehow manage to take over some underground tunnels, and strike out on this bus route. They also somehow manage to get dynamite enough to obliterate a power plant. Three men. And they also manage to fend off police for the hours you watch this movie in utterly boring fashion.The humor was bad. Bad enough that I just sat there throughout the movie just staring at the screen. No laughs. No giggles. Just looking at the screen. Wasn't this movie a comedy? The jokes were all bad, and the actors really didn't care. I mean, anything from the police officers rapping to a super-strong guy making a bad joke about Boo who, this movie's jokes are really sub-par.Just, don't watch it. Many movies should just be avoided - unless you're looking for a night of pure boredom, this movie isn't for you.

I cannot fathom how to explain my overwhelming sense of utter bafflement regarding the Police Academy series. In two days I have written five reviews on the films in chronological order. I have given my thoughts on each film and, attached to each review, a tad bit more insight into the series itself from my own personal viewpoint. The tension is building. Just think -- one more review after this and I will have reviewed all seven films. Will there be any more entries into the epic saga of awful proportions? I sincerely hope not.Police Academy 6 City Under Siege can best be described with one word Horrific. I have never seen 'Manos' The Hands of Fate, which I hear from reliable sources is the worst film to have ever been recorded on celluloid. But I have seen my fair share of crappy films -- especially those tasty MSTK3000 treats -- and so I have a bit of background on the subject.Okay, seeing how the first two Police Academy films raked in 180 million dollars, I can see there being a third film -- perhaps. But a fourth film? No way. Yet it was made. And it flopped. And yet they still made a fifth film (which also flopped). They should never have proceeded to shove this mess into production. Six Police Academy films? No thank you.Steve Guttenberg has left, Bobcat Goldthwait has left, and so have a few other minor actors -- but the main cast remains (and they will until the end of the series). If you haven't been able to tell by now, I'm running out of things to say in my reviews that I have not covered in previous ones. And so I will continue to ramble on pointlessly until an idea strikes me as clever.The city is under siege! Who cares? The executives, of course! A metropolitan crimewave hits the city of our bumbling cadets, and so Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), and Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey) are called into action to find the jewel burglar and bring him to justice! Chaos and pratfalls proceed! Laughs proceed with caution and stumble, just like the cops in the movie, along the way! So, in conclusion, this is an absolutely laugh-free movie! Why am I typing in exclamation? You tell me!Peter Bonerz directed this movie. Bonerz is a veteran of slapstick television -- so was Jerry Paris (Police Academy 2 and 3), and so it makes me curious Do executives at Warner Bros. not understand that there is a difference between TV and feature films? Stupid little pratfalls and loud, noisy Looney-Tune-type sound effects do not make a very good theatrical film. This is like a cartoon transformed into some sort of horrible cartoon-film hybrid. It is evident that Bonerz, like the rest of the directors from this series, has a sense of what makes a funny half-hour television show, but he is lacking the feel for cinematic comedy.There is a big difference. Warner Bros. needs to realize this. For the most part, Police Academy 6 (and all the films, for that matter) involve stupid banana-peel jokes. I've heard and seen funnier things from kindergarteners. And that's pretty sad.Police Academy 6 City Under Siege is not funny at all, and to be brutally honest, that's all there is to know.0/5 stars.

As such the plot is the usual collection of simple pratfalls and antics with the slightest plot about catching criminals that few will care about (and more fool those that do). The material drearily goes over old territory but the few fans the film series have will enjoy it and indeed it did draw the very occasional chuckle from me. However I was in a forgiving mood and even I didn't get more than that from it.e of the cast have anything approaching ambition or drive. They seem happy to be sitting in their cartoon characters for all these movies! Gaynes is as dopey as ever but I like that. Graf is dead now and it's sad to think this is his legacy.

There is one moment in which Bubba Smith makes a computer give him the information by pounding his fist upon the VDT. Surprisingly enough, this is not the most idiotic moment in the film, although it does come close. Another question that constantly springs to mind is where, in the midst of a power grid sabotage, Michael Winslow gets the power to amplify his microphones.As the trivia entry states, this was the last time the characters of Hooks, Hightower, Proctor, and Fackler were seen in this series. They don't mention that it was also the last time Nick Lassard, or Mahoney Lite as he is better known, disgraced the series. It has long been said that he is little more than a pathetic attempt to compensate for the absence of Steve Guttenberg, but his performance is one of the smaller problems in this case.The real problem here is that we've seen this all at least five times before. As I've said in my comments about the third episode, Police Academy works best when it is actually set in an academy. In this case, the action begins in a district of the city where Captain Harris has been assigned far, far away from Commandant Lassard and his merry crew. One would think that a Captain in this situation would work like a dog in order to keep this situation intact. But as he and Proctor are working their old, stale routine, a threesome of robbers manage to steal an undisclosed amount/item right out from under them. This is enough to make one wonder how this man got to be a police lieutennant in the first place.In the end, the main problem is that this installment offers absolutely nothing new compared to previous installments of the series. Winslow makes his noises, Graf does his gun-nut routine, Bailey does his pathetic little momma's-boy thing, Hightower stands there looking big, and Matt McCoy tries to pretend he's Steve Guttenberg. You know a Police Academy film is plumbing a rotten depth when the biggest laughs come from the acts of the criminals, who are on-screen for a total of maybe twenty minutes.All told, I gave Police Academy 6 City Under Siege a one out of ten.

I didn't bother with the seventh but I'd imagine it would be lethal by then.

I don't think I've seen the writers coming up with new material since the second one or so. Granted, most of it is tiresome slapstick, but at least it's new tiresome slapstick. They have dodged some other bullets too. Our heroes don't go on trips anymore, they don't have romantic subplots that go nowhere. They just solve crimes, and are comically bad at it. I even wanted to know who the leak was, the plot is more compelling than usual. Especially Harris and Proctor deliver some good laughs in this one, the bus scenes are pretty funny. The mayor is also a funny character. Generally the post-Mahoney era is rather pointless, but this is by far the best movie of those three. "},{"Title":"The Age of Innocence.. Ends !","Date":"5 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" I'm not a big fan of the Police Academy series. But who can hate it ? It's one of the 1980's real gems. The live cartoon action, the dexterous farce, the childish wittiness.. etc.Actually making comedy in Hollywood afterwards became different. Totally different. At the end of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s, the world itself became uglier, so why not movies ! The bad tasting turned into monster success, the decency became semi-dead, and movies like (She- Devil - 1989), (The War of the Roses - 1989), (Problem Child - 1990) were just the beginning. And (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), (There Is Something about Mary - 1998) and (American Pie - 1999) ruled eventually. So movies like Police Academy came to be old unnecessary fashion; of which you find now only through Walt Disney's family movies, yet without the same originality, or the same sense or essence of the good old 1980s. That kind of polished polite Tom & Jerry type of comic action, which had a lot of bad criticism all the way, was and still is, a good entertainment. Yet here it's a simple good entertainment.There is a wonderful loyalty for all the laws of cartoon (pace, atmosphere, madness, infancy..), I loved the crazy mayor, the 3 dumb criminals whom threatened the city, the unstoppable visual jokes, moreover the great music of (Robert Folk) which nobody ever rated fairly. However, on the other hand, (Matt McCoy) of course is the last one on earth to be in (Steve Guttenberg)'s shoes, the last one to be in a comedy, the last one to stand a second among all of this wild bunch of comic heroes, and the last one to be a lead for a movie ! Also the characters weren't given the chance to be more comic, or to see them in humanly touching situations. The action and the comedy were equal, the fun of the 80 minutes is masterly, but maybe it wasn't huge and creative as the original, otherwise the people at the time became more than full with 5 movies already.(Police Academy 6 City Under Siege) is nice light time, a perfect movie for my Friday afternoon, and a memory from lovely age was ageing at the time. So if you refused it as forgettable, I must say  the condition it puts you in is definitely unforgettable.. And that if you are a lover of the 1980s, Police Academy, the cartoons.. OR NOT. I rest my case.

The old, ratty pair that's falling apart at the seams, haven't been washed in months and everyone says you should just throw away and be done with but, darn it, they've just been around so long that they're comfortable and fit like a pair of slippers?Meet the cinematic equivalent of old shoes.By the time the sixth part of this series came along, the whole world was begging Warner Brothers to find something new to wear.  But no, City Under Siege makes them feel good and if they can still walk around in them....Okay, enough shoe analogy.  This is a movie you should only watch if you want to see what happens when a bunch of old pals get together and decide to play dress-up around old movie sets.The whole gang returns, of course (even Mahler returns as eternally-clumsy Fackler) to make life miserable for Cpt. Harris (Bailey) and try to apprehend a notorious trio of thieves (Moe, Larry and Curly?) whose escalating series of crimes have the City Under Siege.  Hmm...great idea for a movie?Not for this one.I tell you what, let's make a pact I won't review any more of the Police Academy movies if Hollywood promises to find Bubba Smith better work.The best part of the whole movie?  The dye pack scene.  Let's leave it at that.One star.  Over and out - I wish.

Ghostbusters? No, the very funny Police Academy! I have seen bits and pieces of the first film on local television and I thought of it as funny and amusing! Then, the same thing happened with the second film. Then, the third. Next, the fourth!!!!! The fifth is where the laughs keep on rolling! And now, the sixth version (the one I am talking about right now!) is very funny! The seventh and final chapter in the Police Academy saga is the funniest! I recommend all seven of these movies! They must be watched immediately! 10 out of 10!
