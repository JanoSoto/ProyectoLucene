But it does it with such a lack of full credit for grace and feeling. It never belittles children - in fact, it makes adults look like the buffoons they are. You feel for every victory and defeat they have and get engrossed in their plots and problems. The encounters with common Iranians is also wonderful, especially the soldier at the end. Perhaps the most natural example of child acting is shown through Rezayeh - I am surprised she was never nominated for anything in this film. Her other films are also great, but nothing matches The White Balloon Not to be missed - one of the best Iranian films of all time, without question.

An unseen radio informs us that the Iranian New Year is almost upon the town; a tradition for this annual event is to either catch or buy a fish (fish represent life).  Razieh, the little girl, is unsatisfied with the selection of fish in the family's pond.  She complains that the family's fish are too skinny.  Eventually, Razieh's brother, Ali (Mohsen Kalifi's only role thus far), cons their mother into letting Razieh have a 500 note (Iranian money) to buy the fish that she wants.  On her way to the market, Razieh loses the money two times.  It is the second loss that is the most serious - the money falls into the cellar of a closed shop through a sidewalk drain.  The remainder of the film is devoted to the introduction of various strangers offering either to help retrieve the note or pass the time with light-humored conversation.Beautiful cinematography (winner of the Camera d'or at Cannes in 1994), memorable characters, and stunning direction backed by Kiarostami's expertly written script make for a great film that was reminiscent of my viewing of John Sayles' Secret of Roan Inish.  Like Sayles' film, there is a magical, absorbing quality to The White Balloon that spellbinds the viewer regardless of age.

Her mother (Fereshteh Sadr Orfani) gives her the money and she sets out to buy said fish.  Along the way she continually loses the money and must rely on the kindness of strangers to help her.This is a very slight film.  It's plot is wafer thin in terms of traditional narrative, it may well frustrate many viewers with it's gentling strolling style.  However it is quite funny on the surface.  The many people who come and go during Razieh's journey are amusing - from the tailor berating a customer for having a small face causing his shirts to not look correctly tailored to the antics of the honest snake charmers.  It's not a laugh out loud type of film but it does have a gentle humour throughout that is fun if you are in the mood for it.In fact you really need to be in the mood for the whole thing - if you're lacking patience then you'll probably not last out this film but if you're willing to stick with it then you may be pleasantly surprised by the whole thing.  The story doesn't grip you, but the humour helps to divert attention from this.  In fact the guts of this film seems to be a message on the nature of society.Throughout the film Razieh finds herself relying on the kindness or honesty of strangers to help her get her money.  The towards the end one of the characters (a soldier played by Mohammad Shaani) talks to Razieh about his sisters and about what he has in common with her.  He then defends himself when Ali (Mohsen Kalifi) attacks his sister for talking with strangers.  This is closely followed by a short scene where all the characters that had interacted with Razieh cross the screen at the same time without really acknowledging each other.  The message here is clear - that society is a lot closer knit than we think and it's only times of trouble where we turn to others.  Instead we should develop the relationships with strangers that we easily could.However this message is not delivered until the end of the film and it's only then that you understand what you've been watching.  However the gentle comedy of the strangers make it easy to follow the film till this conclusion.  Unlike other reviewers I don't think Mohammadkani was that good - she did come across as a very weepy brat and it was hard to sympathise with the problems that are all her own fault.  However the other roles are good, Kalifi is the best child actor as Razieh and the other characters seem natural and forced (although Shahani's soldier is a bit preachy).Overall a gently amusing film that is light on plot, but delivers it's simple message intelligently without forcing it down your throat.

That film had a young boy trying to give back some other boy's homework that he accidentally took home. This one has a little girl having all kinds of problems trying to buy a goldfish on New Year's Eve. Each of these children have to navigate their way through a world of adults in a culture where the young are to be seen, but not heard. The earlier film is quite a bit better than The White Balloon, but this is a wonderful film in its own right. It has a wonderful set piece where a street performer thinks that the girl is donating the money she has for her goldfish to a snake charmer. She has to work up the courage to speak up for herself, and then to take the money when it has been wrapped around a snake. My only real problem with the film was the lead performance, by Aida Mohammadkhani. She has really nice facial expressions, but her voice and line delivery are monotonous; truth be told, she gets kind of obnoxious after a while. Mohsen Kalifi, who plays her older brother, is wonderful, on the other hand. I really liked the way the sibling relationship was developed. Kiarostami, genius that he is, adds some small details that give the film a much deeper resonance than one might find at first glance (I'd almost call this a trademark of his). The sequence with the titular balloon, along with the haunting final shot, is the kind of thing that could make this film last forever inside of me.

Whilst the most part of the runtime is spent following the little girl Razieh around the city streets of Tehran, the film ends with her and her brother running away out of sight, and instead draws focus on the Hazara boy standing there alone, clutching his single balloon. Far from being a heart-warming tale, The White Balloon tells of childhood selfishness, greed and desperation, amongst other things. In the film, these traits are shared by all the other (apparently) grown-up adults too the father who becomes distressed over a bar of soap, the mother who is too busy to help her child, the shady snake charmers who try to steal Razieh's money, and the various shopkeepers and people out and about. All these people are out for themselves. It is perhaps Panahi's (or Kiarostami's) opinion that whilst the girl and her brother's childhood impatience and moody behaviour can be tolerated due to sheer naivety, the fact these traits are still abundant in mature people is to be decried. The only person who possesses none of these failings is the balloon seller, who selfishly helps the girl retrieve her money. In the end he is left thankless.The simple title belies this films widespread reproach of modern society, as the film is played out in real-time (lending it a disarming verisimilitude) in the cultural and economic centre of Iran.

To have anyone say that this movie had no point and that the title made no sense is annoying. There are several things to be taken from this movie. First of all it is a realistic glimpse of Iranian daily life. Its not pretty and scenic as in other Iranian films. There were so many people who were concerned about their own needs over the girl's money, who by the way was a complete brat. However you should take note that despite their incompentence or lack of concern for the girl, each attempted to help her out, albeit often grudgingly. It is important to understand why the Afghani boy was freezed upon. This could be a class/cultural/social issue. First of all these middle class children were ungrateful and ran off as soon as they got their money. 2nd, the tensions between Afghani and Iranians have been notable as you can probably see in films such as Baran. 3rd this is about the human nature of looking out for yourself over everything else. Once the children got what they wanted, everything else doesn't matter. The white balloon was the only balloon not purchased. It was alone in the end just like the Afghani boy.

Where is the Friend's Home comes to mind immediately, only this is beguiling. Here the grown-ups, as estranged from the natural of children as they can be, are eventually willing to help.Also the little girl is not faultless either. Actually she is a pest. Anything bad that comes is due to her only. She is greedy, cunning, desperate, spoiled. That's it. While she is cute. Well, because all kids her age are the same way greedy, cunning, selfish, desperate, spoiled; a pest, while extremely cute. That's why we love them.Is it then a nice comedy about a cute girl who desires a goldfish? Not exactly, that's just another level of deception.As it comes to the end, we realize the remarkable wholeness of this movie a close space, just a couple of streets, a very short period of time, just a couple of hours, just a few personages, confined to this small space and time. Each one (not only the girl) is acting somehow frenetically, and the resulting whole is a crazy small universe, absurdly self-sufficient.These people are acting totally unaware of each other, except when it happens to collide; in these particular situations they fight or cooperate, or do the both, then again each one is unaware of others' presence.There is however a boy who's the exception, a stranger (an Afghan immigrant)... but you should watch the movie to get it.

The story is really quite simple- a  young girl desperately, and by adult standards irrationally,  desires a new gold fish for New Years ceremonies. Through a wide range of complex adventures she gains and loses the financial resources to make her purchase. With this simple story two of  Iran's most distinguished and influential directors Jafar Panahi (the director) and Abbas Kiarosrami (The writer of this film's screenplay) create a narrative that argues for the basic goodness and decency of the average citizen of Tehran.Watching this film from an American context is a remarkably political experience. In a country that has replaced cold war nonsense (USSR is the evil empire) with a new racist Islamaphobia that tries to rival the days of the European  crusades, watching a film in which the basic daily lives of Arab citizens are treated with dignity is a liberating experience.While the film obviously has a number of subtle an beautifully  realized political and social messages that evidently resonate within in its own national context, it should also be respected for its cross-cultural themes and it's ability to inspire audiences from diverse backgrounds around the world. ...........

If you got a raw deal, you felt hard done by and if it happened enough, it might haunt you to this day. There was an acute sense that that was not how things should be. That is definitely the sense one gets from the determination of the kids in this elegant, poetic movie. A girl wants to get a goldfish before Tehran shuts down for Iranian New Year (Nahrouz). Seems like it should go fairly simply, right? And if this was an adult telling the story, it wouldn't be notable. However, kids are more vulnerable and can be more affected by circumstances. The kids have to be a little more determined to get what they want and the child actors in this movie, Aida Mohammadkani as the little girl, Mohsen Kafili as her brother, and Aliasghar Smadi as the balloon seller were excellent.As I saw some other reviewers say, this is a film that doesn't patronize children.

Your money is gone.After seeing Offside (2006), I decided to see more of Jafar Panahi and out of the three films I decided to see, The White Balloon is the first one.The White Balloon takes place on New Year's eve. Seven year old Razieh is sad because she saw beautiful gold fishes in a pet shop but her mother won't let her have any because they have a pond with gold fish already. It is a tradition to have a gold fish for New Year's and after discussing it with her brother, Ali - who is a few years older than Razieh - she manages to convince their mother to give them the money to buy a goldfish in exchange for a balloon that she received. Happy and with a 500 torans note in her fish bowl, Razieh heads out to the pet shop. However, many obstacles and just as many characters will find themselves on her road to the sought out gold fish.This film narrates one of the simplest stories in a sweet way. On many occasions it reminded me of Children of Heaven (1997) - the simple story, the struggles of children and the pervasive themes of money, poverty, the crowded streets of Tehran and of course, all of this centering around a fantastic child actress, Aida Mohammadkhani.It was really heartwarming to see this little child try and convince adults that this money is life and death for her. The way she has to impose herself because adults won't listen to a child is truly moving. Her issues are varied the multiple attempts she makes to procure the money but also the genuine help she receives from strangers, a notion that is discussed when a soldier argues with her about the notion of what being a stranger really is.There are a lot of things that we the viewers are never told, but this didn't concern us, we were too focused on the journey with the 500 torans to care anyway. The movie walks a fine line between the absurd and realism while exploring the edges and angles of social interactions. In no overt way political (unlike the other movies from Panahi can be) it is a very straight forward tale. We are pleasantly reminded that it doesn't take a billion dollar budget to film a good movie.On the other hand, the movie arouses our fears at the outset, without actually fulfilling them. We, as adult viewers, are afraid that Razieh will get hurt or robbed at any moment and when we realize our fears were unfounded it makes us wonder about this misanthropic fear we have of other human beings who we class as strangers. Maybe we've been fooled too many times and we are wary of the innocence children can have.The movie could have explored more avenues - explore their family, for example, or had music and perhaps more landscape shots - nevertheless, those would all have been decorative. The movie remains at heart as the story it tells, short and poignantly bare.I liked No unnecessary frills. Razieh is a lovely character. Endearing. Innocence of childhood.I disliked Maybe some characters were purposely threatening just to provoke a sense of fear in the viewer.78/100 If you've enjoyed Children of Heaven (1997) I would recommend this to you. If you like stories involving child actors this is a must see.Read more reviews at www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Simplicity gives rise to eternal beauty.","Date":"11 March 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Family","Review":" The White Balloon is a movie which banks upon it's unbelievably simple story and settings.

Well, the little girl's very cute, indeed, but the story, from my point of view, is far from being that beautiful.First off, the trouble she gets involved is all her fault. She just doesn't follow her mother's advices/orders like passing by a dangerous place or talking with strangers. Second, all she can do is cry and wait for others to solve the problem she caused by herself. Third, she's not capable of saying at least a small Thank you when everything becomes fine for her. Is this beautiful? I don't think so.Alright, you can say that she's so young and innocence is all she's got, so let's give her a little chance here. Now, what can you tell me about her brother? It's very obvious that he's a way more clever and, let's say it this way, more experienced than the little girl. He's always concerned about her little sister's well-being and that's great, but this is something that most of the brothers around the world do, so there's no need to say that his actions are beautiful. And on the other hand, the way he treats the Afghani kid is not kind at all. First, by rudely taking his stick and then (here I go again), by not saying a little Thank you to him even when the Afghani kid bought with his own money the chewing gum and then let the Iranian ones use his stick, just to help the little girl... All the Afghani kid gets is loneliness when the new year comes... is this beautiful?I clearly understand that the movie is a big metaphor about trying to help each other and being able to show gratitude. And I stick myself to this meaning for the movie didn't leave me a beautiful feeling for one way or another, the grown-ups tried to help the little girl in their very own way, so there's not such an adult indifference here. But when another kid really helps them out, all he gets is the indifference that most of the viewers thought the sister and brother were suffering.Anyway, and now talking about the movie in a general way, I think that the Director could save at least 20 minutes of film by avoiding some long and useless scenes. For example, the one where the kid brings soap instead of shampoo; all the repetitive dialogues the little girls has as well as the long and boring one when the old man explains to his friends why he was arguing with a client. This extra-material makes the movie a little bit slow and, sometimes, boring. That's why I give this 7 out of ten stars.

Allegedly, he had been producing a film critical of the Iranian government; that is, he was calling a spade a spade.As a sort of one-man protest, I decided to watch one of Panahi's movies. 'The White Balloon (1995)' was the director's feature debut, and won the Caméra d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It tells an extremely simple tale, almost in real time a young girl is given a 500-toman banknote to buy a goldfish for the Iranian New Year. On the way to the market, she loses the money down a sewer grate, and spends the rest of the film trying to get it back, either ignored or aided by the strangers she meets.Putting the plot so simply doesn't really suggest a riveting cinematic experience, but I must say I was taken by the effectiveness of the film. We experience the bustling marketplace through the lens of the young girl, and genuinely share her mixed emotions. This really struck a chord with me. When I was a prep (age 5), I got lost during a school excursion, and I can still recall the dropping of my stomach, the quickened breathing, the welling of tears (don't worry, we got icy poles afterwards!). That's the feeling I got here, particularly when the snake charmer stole the girl's money and claimed it as a donation. I felt as helpless as she did.Fortunately, the film's overriding emotion is one of optimism. Strangers, seeing a child in distress, stop to offer their assistance. A young Afghan balloon-seller proffers a stick and chewing gum with which to retrieve the out-of-reach money. The girl's brother, a resourceful kid of about age ten, arrives on the scene, and suddenly everything seems like it's going to be OK. Sometimes simple films can be the most enjoyable of all.

The copy I was loaned was apparently from Singapore or Hong Kong.But anyway, to the film. A young girl is given money to satisfy a personal desire for a pet. But during her journey she runs into a cross section of Persian society, each representing a faction or layer of Iranian social strata, and their effect and demands on the young generation, and specifically the unempowered female population.A plethora of individuals are encountered. Whirling dervishes, a young soldier, a shop keeper, a father, a motherly woman who is not the main character's mother, a young brother and many more.We're shown coded forms of communication regarding what each social faction demands and is preoccupies the thoughts and feelings of Iran's natives. I pride myself on being able to decipher such meaty films, but it did take a little bit to decode the inner message, but it's there.Currently, as I write this, Iran's leadership still desires to pursue a nuclear weapon's program and to become a major influence in the Persian Gulf region. Including, but not limited to, assisting the insurgents in Iraq which our forces have fought, and have finally brought under control. Iran's leadership is posturing, but is fighting the aged old social conflict of a moderate middle populace becoming factionalized by misallocated resources. Can Iran continue to focus its domestic lens on the United States as a means of slight of hand to avoid its inner stresses and strains? Time will tell. This film doesn't hold the answer to any of those larger questions, but it does illustrate an interesting pastiche of what forces are pulling on Iran's society, and how half the population remain unimpowered because of a deliberate and manufactured reliance.Otherwise it's a nice little film. A bit slow, well shot, and certainly more than meets the eye.An interesting piece of political commentary disguised as a children's film.Give it a whirl if you like foreign films.

She manages to persuade her mother to give her the money, then goes out into the streets to buy her fish. And that's where the adventure starts.From this simple storyline, Panahi constructs a beautiful film about a child moving through an adult world. You become so wrapped up in this little girl's world, that the mishaps along the way to buying this fish become like the elements of a suspenseful thriller.Well worth seeing.

With that in mind, I want to ask Iranian viewers to comment on these conclusions.The film is NOT about cute kids.  * The girl was told many times that the fish she wanted was NOT bigger than the one she had, but she went after it anyway. * The girl was relentless asking her cash-strapped mother for money for a goldfish, and through annoying persistence got her way.* But the final scene is the one that seared itself in my mind---the boy and girl run away as soon as they have their money, leaving the Hazara boy sitting there alone, not even thanked.So I find the film a cleverly veiled attack on the girl's selfish opportunism and lack of feeling for the people who helped her.If anyone knows Kiarostami or has read any interviews, please enlighten me!!

I can compare and contrast.  This movie shows that children's perspectives are sometimes universal.  I liked this movie.  It is a simple story, simply done.  The little girl that is the star isn't exactly a sympathetic character.  Mostly because of her whining performance.  This casting error seems to be the only flaw, but it is a major one.  The young actor who plays her brother practically steals the show.  I hope to see more of him in the future.  Having said all this, I do recommend the movie.

It was brilliant. I only saw it once, but was astounded at the simplicity of it, yet I could not draw my eyes away. Absolutely amazing. Worth seeing. It is about a girl who sets out to buy a goldfish, but things happen on the way. It is almost a parallel to the story in the Bible where Jesus was tempted by the devil. But it's not like the Last Temptation of Christ "},{"Title":"Fascinating film about how kind people can be.","Date":"19 August 2000","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family","Review":"  I disagree with the summary - nobody really tried to take advantage of the little girl.  A problem with the film is that even the con men dervishes return the money.  It is very seductive, making absolute trivialities riveting.  Maybe the roughness of the father, the self centeredness of the shirt maker, the human weaknesses of almost all the characters, including the protagonist, put an edge on a film that should be too sweet to stand but isn't.   It's great to see someone make a good film that has no baddies.

The story is almost non-existent and the little girl is a brat, I couldn't give a damn about her losing her money. Sure, the kids were cute. They're phenomenal actors.They deserve a film with a better story. And the title doesn't mean anything. "}]
