[{"Title":"Director Rush Goes Down with the Ship","Date":"8 July 2002","Score":"44 out of 69 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Romance, Thriller","Review":"  There's a good film in here somewhere just aching to get out, but the filmmakers seem more interested in playing Box Office Wheel of Fortune than caring about the quality of the product they're trying to sell, and it makes `Color of Night,' directed by Richard Rush, one of those movies that makes you shake your head and think, Ah! what could have been if only!  And that single `if' makes all the difference in the world with regards to what finally winds up on the screen.When his treatment of a patient fails and ends tragically, leaving him with some pronounced psychological damage of his own, New York psychologist Dr. Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) quits his practice and goes to Los Angeles seeking the solace and, perhaps, the help of an old friend and colleague, Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula).  Capa quickly discovers, however, that Moore is having problems of his own, apparently stemming from a weekly group therapy session he has been conducting for some time.  Moore, it seems, has recently received some death threats, which he believes are coming from one of the patients of this particular group, though he hasn't a clue which one, nor any proof of his suspicions.  Moore invites Capa to sit in on the next group session, hoping for a fresh perspective and possibly some insights into the matter.  At the moment, Capa feels incapable of actively engaging in the practice of his chosen field of endeavor, but in light of the fact that he's Bob's house guest, he acquiesces and agrees to observe the group.  But it proves to be an inauspicious proposition for all concerned, and subsequent circumstances quickly put Capa at the center of just the kind of situation he left New York to avoid.  Once the hand is dealt, however, he has no choice but to play it out to the end.Rush began his career as a director with low budget exploitation films like `Too Soon to Love' in 1960, and ten films later achieved legitimate status with the highly successful black comedy, `The Stunt Man' in 1980, for which he received an Oscar nomination (along with his leading man, Peter O'Toole).  He did not direct again until this film, some fourteen years later, and during that hiatus, Rush apparently lost whatever expertise he had accrued by 1980, and his `roots' are clearly showing in this one.  The violence of the film is inherent in the story, but Rush makes it unnecessarily graphic; and while this could have been an incisive and insightful character study (and intrinsically more interesting), he takes the low road, fleshing it out instead with scenes of gratuitous sex and nudity, as well as superfluous action (he works in no less than two ridiculous car chases, one culminating in a vehicle being pushed from the top of a high rise parking garage).  Furthermore, he ignores motivations and character development almost entirely; the two areas that required the most attention if this film was going to work at all.  Rush especially lets his actors down, inasmuch as most of these characters presented real challenges that could have been met much more successfully with the help and guidance of the director.  Rush would have served his actors, as well as himself, better had he taken the time to explore these people being portrayed with some depth.  He apparently did not, however, and with one exception the performances by one and all suffer for it.      In 1994, Bruce Willis simply was not the accomplished actor he is today, and he, especially, could have used some help in finding his character.  it was help he obviously did not get, and his Capa ends up being too much John McClane and not enough Malcom Crowe.  Willis flounders between the two personalities, creating a kind of schizophrenic characterization that seriously affects the credibility of his portrayal.  And it's the same fate suffered by Scott Bakula here.  Even in the scenes which places them in their `professional' setting as psychoanalysts, they are simply not convincing.Making the case of poor directing even stronger are the performances of Lesley Ann Warren (Sondra), Brad Dourif (Clark), Ruben Blades (Lt. Martinez) and Kevin J. O'Connor (Casey).  Like Willis, all of them seem to have trouble defining their individual characters, vacillating between any number of personalities and unable to achieve that necessary, final focus.  It's the kind of indecisiveness that is usually resolved during rehearsals, but inexplicably made it to the screen here.  The single exception is the performance turned in by Lance Henriksen, as Buck, who unlike his costars, somehow managed to find his character and make him convincing.The odd-'woman'-out of the entire bunch is Jane March, who as Rose has perhaps the most challenging role of all, and when given the opportunity actually displays some talent.  Unfortunately, Rush-- for the most part-- uses her in a way that is demeaning and without merit, and she becomes the object of a sleight-of-hand that is nothing more than a cheap trick Rush pulls out of his hat.  And by failing to use her in a more productive way, by not concentrating on developing her character (which is so vital to the story), Rush commits his most critical error of all.   The supporting cast includes Eriq La Salle (Detective Anderson), Jeff Corey (Ashland), Kathleen Wilhoite (Michelle), Shirley Knight (Edith Niedelmeyer), John Bower (Medical Examiner) and Andrew Lowrey (Dale Dexter).  The high note of this entire project was played before it ever even got off the ground, that being the story itself; but screenwriters Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray proceeded to methodically remove any and all credibility it may have initially contained, and Rush took it from there, taking `Color of Night' straight into that black hole reserved for movies that fail to deliver on their promise.  It is not surprising that Rush has not directed a feature film since this one; once the magic is lost, it's hard to retrieve.  2/10.

Look, I saw this film late at night and as a big Bruce Willis fan I liked it. And believe me, I'm not a moron, there's nothing wrong with me. I just liked this film, it was good entertainment (just what a film is supposed to do), good thrilling, (just what a thriller should do!) and good acting. Nice of Brad Dourif to drop by in this film, I remembered him from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Billy) immediately.Now for the story, I think character building was adequate. Of course you must not think too much. No psychiatrist would visit their patients at home and there is more that doesn't add up, but never the less, I was surprised with the end. People are getting killed and the killer is out there, really close to the main character. You really don't know who did it, all though you have your hunches. And that makes a thriller worth while, I think. And about eroticism, this film has stuff for him and her. Bruce really looks great in jeans and you get to see him naked here! And Jane March is stunning, also naked. Beautiful sex-scenes and nicely edited. The film has a nice chase too, a Mercedes SL against a Camaro or Trans Am.Advice see this film and judge for yourself! (and write it down here!) Switch your senses off and just let yourself be entertained. You'll see, you'll like it!

In nearly eleven years of knowingly watching these patients switch from personality to personality, I have yet to see this happen. This is before we even get into the fact that Jane March's behaviour during this film more closely resembles that of a person suffering mania - hypersexuality, paranoia, irrational fear, and so forth.Bruce Willis must also be wondering why he signed up for this stinker. I'm sure the shooting script must have looked wonderful, but a combination of extremely clumsy editing (the sex scenes in the middle of the film are a wonderful example) and poor character development turned this into another Plan 9 From Outer Space. To all of you who gave this turkey positive comments, I ask you to ask yourselves what psychiatrist in their right mind would see patients in buildings where it is that easy for patients to off themselves? Especially in such a lawsuit-happy society as America? What psychiatrist in their right mind stays back late in their office without carrying a firearm when they know someone is stalking them? Finally, when was the last time you heard of a psychiatrist taking over a group of patients for a friend in the profession when one of them might have murdered him? Oh, and a special note on Ruben Blades' role even beat police are not that ignorant about psychiatry, an especially important element of their job considering how often they may be confronted by psych patients waving weapons in the middle of an episodic crisis.As a veteran of numerous therapy groups, I could not stop laughing at this film. If it had been approached with the intention of making a comedy, then it would have succeeded beyond all expectations. However, the advertising campaign and the babbling tone of the dialogue left me with the general feeling that this film was taking itself WAY too seriously. If you do take yourself that seriously, get a better script. If you have such a ridiculous script that will get laughed at by the 20% that will experience some form of psychiatric problem in their lifetime (that's just a statistical fact based on reported cases... the real incidence may actually be higher), don't take yourself so seriously. It's that simple.

Richard Rush could have done better, but the psychological film we see, adds nothing to what has already been shown before.From the beginning we realize who the killer is, as well as the person with the multiple personality problem. It's too obvious! The film relies heavily on the sexual attraction between Bill Capa and Rose. Much has been speculated in this forum about whether we are actually seeing Willis' willis, or not. Since most male stars wouldn't be caught dead showing their genitals, for obvious reasons, what is seen for a second in the pool scene is that of a body double. On the other hand, we see Jane March showing it all, which is a welcome attraction.Only the final sequence has any impact. There are many things in the plot that don't add up and the viewer is ahead of the story at all times.Bruce Willis with a hairpiece looks good. Jane March has a better chance with the character she plays. Also Brad Dourif, Lance Henriksen have their moments. The one that doesn't come across well is Ruben Blades, an otherwise excellent actor trying to do a Columbo routine in this film.

Yes, there were a couple of fairly ludicrous things late in the movie, such as climbing the tower for no apparent reason, (but remember, that character was a loon) and especially the red Firebird on the top of the parking garage. I have an idea why these things were forced into the movie. Probably just because someone (Rush?) thought it would be cool to photograph. It's sort of like porn, where the most common positions aren't done to reflect real life, or because they are particularly erotic, or even comfortable, but because they provide the best camera angle. Aside from the last twenty minutes or so, the film was pretty good. Jane March being naked a lot helped, of course. It is odd that Willis' character didn't recognize her in her Bonnie persona while walking past her, she didn't look that different. However, I wouldn't have caught on that she was Richie, also. (NOTE This is NOT a spoiler, because March is listed as all those characters in the cast list on IMDb, which I saw before viewing the movie.) The film has elements of many different genres, and could be thought of as a psychological thriller, an action movie, a dreamy love story, and a regular murder mystery. Bruce Willis turned in a good performance. As much as I try to dislike his smarmy, perpetual smirk, he has a certain charisma as an actor that I cannot deny. In spite of its flaws, this film is worth a look.

I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!

Right in the middle of the film, I had to pee. I wasn't going anywhere. New York, Psychiatrist, Willis (he has acted better) who drove a patient (the great Kathleen Wilhotte) to jump out a window, has to get his mind back, where guilt has surged through him. He takes a vacation, flying to dunny L.A, to stay at an old colleague's (underused actor Bakula) place. He's also a psychiatrist, a more successful one thanks to a non fictional book he sold. He's pad is great. He also a short future, as someone does him, where Willis, hit with a double whammy you could say, takes over the group, while being a prime suspect. I loved Ruben Blades in this, as the cop, one of the better, if probably the best performances, that alongside Henricksen who plays one of the patients, who's carrying a lot of baggage. Now lets talk about the cooky, larger than life patients. No, lets not. Their just entertaining to watch. This movie really makes the patient group scenes fun, one of the best things I like about this movie. Willis also strikes up a hot relationship, with the so judged misjudged actress, March. You'll see why in it's shock revelation at the end, after all the nail gun shooting (Owlll, I felt that) and before the end credits come running too fast up the screen. Off the beaten track, like in other movies, with the credits running some fast, I don't know why they even bother. Back to the movie. Color Of Night, is a fun treat yourself psychological thriller, (you'll never guess the killer, unless your IQ is bloody high) which I never at anytime, got bored with. It's entertaining all the way through, my favourite BW film.

There is a lot of appeal in this sort of plot, and here Bruce Willis plays a psychiatrist who takes a break from his practice after pushing a disturbed patient to her suicide. To recover from this traumatic event, he travels across the country to visit an old friend and colleague. Then after his friend is murdered, he takes over his friend's therapy group at the request of the cop on the case, and tries to figure out who the killer is.I am no Bruce Willis fan, but after seeing a portion of this on TV I was compelled to rent this film. The tape version supposedly contains 15 extra minutes not in the theater version, some of which no doubt is the steamy sex between the Bruce Willis and Jane March characters. That Bruce Willis would fall head-over-heels for Jane March after only a brief chance encounter is not really believable, but this movie works best if you suspend this sort of disbelief and just enjoy it.Scott Bakula, who shines as Captain Archer in Enterprise, the newest entry in the Star Trek sequence of TV series, is appealing here as the colleague who Bruce Willis comes to visit. But the performance of Ruben Blades, the detective working the case, is so over-the-top that I have to consider this a dark comedy. If not a dark comedy, then why was Blades permitted to make such a mockery of his character?The movie works because of the earnestness of the Bruce Willis character, and his determination to unravel the mystery (a la the Joseph Cotton character in The Third Man). The situation does get resolved in the end, in a way that is both surprising and satisfying. An enjoyable film if you can suspend your disbelief and take it on its own terms.7/10 "},{"Title":"This movie is better than it seems...","Date":"9 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Romance, Thriller","Review":"  Bruce Willis is brilliant as a psychologist, and Scott Bakula does a great job too in his role.

The previous night I had popped in the more recent thriller, Signs, which stars another massive, fresh-faced cracker (Mel Gibson a.k.a The Messiah) and was so bored I passed out. I feel that this was due in large part to Signs' attempt at registering as respectable cinema... basically Shyamalan emulating his breakout hit The Sixth Sense- another decent movie starring mr. willis...I thought that most of the characters in Color of Night were well-fleshed-out (no pun intended) and likable. The patients' neuroses were a bit contrived but entertaining nonetheless... esp. Sondra's nymphomania and Clark's OCD.The important thing to realize here is that with a flick like Color of Night the primary reward is ENTERTAINMENT... nothing about it is really very thought-provoking which should be obvious from the get-go. I might not be blessed with a tuning fork for mysteries but I was in the dark as to who the killer was for a while and I found some of the plot twists surprising.The big sale comes of course with the tension between hot co-stars Big Bruce and the buck-toothed but beautiful Jane March... and the myriad sexual encounters which ensue. The kicker is of course the sex-in-the-pool scene, where we are first introduced to March's creamy goodness and gumdrop nipples, and a few short glimpses of Bruce's engorged willis.The film is downright titillating... with basically every character boning the luscious Rose, who, it seemed to me, was the obvious choice for killer extraordinaire. I think the ending will surprise all but the most vigilant viewers... plus, the cars are cool (Rose drives a teal-and-pink Geo Tracker for chrissakes), the setting is so.cal., the breasts are bare, tan lines on full display and lots of creative violence including but not limited to a rattlesnake in the mailbox... oh yeah and there's a cameo appearance by that one dude from Quantum Leap.Pop some popcorn and don't expect any Academy Award-caliber acting!!

There are little reminders of his talent early on when Willis' psychiatrist is getting to know the mercurial Jane March. Rush has a knack for making the viewer feel like they're being caught up and swept along in someone's feverish dream - the editing and camera placement seem haphazardly designed to make you feel a little dizzy and open to suggestion. But otherwise, Color of Night is episodic, dim-witted, way over-long, and wildly overblown. There is a lot of over-emoting in this film, especially from that queen of over-emoters - Lesley Ann Warren. The movie's idea of excitement is to have various repellent characters scream the F-word a lot, have tears run down their cheeks and threaten to go off the deep end but never quite do. And there are downright idiotic chase scenes, particularly the one that takes place in the parking garage for some reason, instead of just running him down, the mysterious Camaro driver pushes a parked car off an upper level and tries to time it so that it will land on Willis on the bottom level. And then of course in the very next scene, Willis is behaving as if nothing really traumatic has happened. In fact, Willis is tentative and under-directed throughout the film.There is one interesting footnote however. Has anyone else noticed the similarity to The Sixth Sense, at least as far as basic premise? True, the films couldn't be more different in terms of development of story or quality, but to wit Both star Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist who feels tremendous guilt over a patient he's failed, and they both highlight the color red.

Color of Night, amazingly, is worse. In this straight-to-trashcan production by Alan Smithee wannabe Rush, Bruce Willis and Jane March co-star in what was probably intended as a psychological thriller, but turned out as a campy comedy with very few laughs. Support actors Pakula, Warren, Dourif and Blades murder lines from a script that should have never been considered for production. The plot roams, swerves and bucks without making any sense at any point in the movie. None of the characters convince or connect, and none of the dialogue moves or sparkles, though Dourif does try. The Raspberries go to Willis and March, though. Willis gets his for the worst script-picking of his career. And March for the mistake of thinking she's in a Playboy feature - though the camera work supports this misconception. These two are supposed to be young lovers, but there is no recognizable chemistry whatsoever. Even the sex scenes are lame and unconvincing. Yes, we get to see Willis's willy. And yes, there isn't much of ms. March we don't get to see. But I've never seen two actors who looked less like they enjoyed making out, and I've seen Attack of the Clones twice.

It's one of the steamiest, wackiest and most ludicrous erotic thrillers that the 90's has to offer. I'm not kidding, this one navigates its way to the edge of the map of believability and logic, and with a knowing wink, dives headlong right off the edge of it into realms of sweaty, sexy excess, characters so strange they seem to be from a looney toons episode directed by David Lynch, and a preposterous story that has to be seen to be disbelieved. That's not to say I don't like it; I love the hot mess and yearn for a re-watch, just as soon as I track down a DVD. Bruce Willis eases into the erotic tropes with gusto that would make Michael Douglas proud, playing color blind psychiatrist Bill Capa who gets a nerve shake-up when a distraught female patient (Kathleen Wilhouette in a cameo of gushing melodrama) takes a suicidal swan dive out of his forty story office to the NYC streets below. Soon after, he's tasked with taking over a support group previously run by a colleague (Scott Bakula) who was murdered under mysterious circumstances. The group is populated by several oddball weirdos, one of whom may be the one who offed the good doctor Bakula. There's tortured ex cop Buck (Lance Henriksen, always welcome and one of the only performers who takes things seriously here), OCD weasel Clark (Brad Dourif) and a host of others, all competing as to who can be the strangest red herring in the proceedings. Capa soon finds himself sexually involved with the impossibly sultry Rose (Jane March). And when I say sexually, I. Mean. Sexually. It's hard to reach the clawing levels of heightened on-screen copulation that this baby throws at us without slipping into outright parody, and indeed sometimes it feels like we're watching the 9/12 Weeks spoof scene in Hot Shots Part 1. It helps though, that March is breathtakingly sexy and spends a solid slice of the film absolutely in the nude, and slathered with all kinds of fluids, bodily and other. What doesn't help? Willis's grizzly bear fur coat of a torso and the moment where he bears his wee willy winker dinker in naked glory, making sure that anyone who didn't quite get that image burned into their retinas with a similar scene in Pulp Fiction gets a glorious second chance here. Oh goody. Anyways, between bouts of feral coitus, Willis and March navigate treacherous waters to smoke the killer out and save their skins. They also get bothered by a bumbling detective (vivacious Ruben Blades) that would make Columbo proud. Supporting work is also provided by Kevin J. O Connor, Shirley Knight, Erick Avari, Eric Lasalle and Lesley Ann Warren who add extra incredulity to gild the already silly tone. It's large. It's loud. It's oiled up. It's a really unbelievable piece of violent eroticism, and despite everything... I loves me some Color Of Night.

Willis shows off thickened hair and muscles. March looks great on film. Both show generous amounts of flesh and have good crying scenes. Neither are convincing, however.

There just isn't anything that even remotely resembles a good movie. The film casts Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist(Please!) who becomes traumatized after a very disturbed patient commits suicide before his very eyes. He then suffers another blow(no pun intended) when his doctor-friend(Scott Bakula) is brutally murdered. Willis is then called in to take over Bakula's creepy group, and the mysterious murders continue. Meanwhile, Bruce gets involved with an attractive, but strange fender-bender(Jane March) who has some bizarre connection to the unfortunate chain of events in his life. Bruce is his inimitable DIE HARD-self, and Jane March is pretty in a girlish sort-of-way, but their sex scenes are very difficult to watch because Willis, while undeniably a good-looking guy, still looks every bit of his forty years, while his partner looks all of fourteen, effectively killing any sex appeal this film was suppose to have. But, of course, that is the very least of the movie's problems. Most of the problems can be traced back to the script, a ridiculous combination of BASIC INSTINCT/FATAL ATTRACTION/PSYCHO-type cliches. If you are wondering  what the most suspenseful parts of the movie are, there aren't any. The true horror is in the fact that this ugly little number ever got made. This is the price we pay for going to see movies like BASIC INSTINCT. Believe it or not, this movie was directed by Richard Rush, the same guy who gave us the brilliant THE STUNT MAN.

The general sense is that one of the group did it, but no one knows which one.Richard Rush directed The Stuntman, an exceptionally fine film, more than a decade earlier and this represents his return. I imagine that Rush is responsible for the sunny location shooting in LA and for the evocative production design. The house -- if that's what it is -- that Willis takes over from his deceased friend is a massive structure fitted out with expensive toys. I wouldn't like to think that all LA shrinks live like that. He's also been very careful about certain details. The color red, for instance. We don't see it that often but when we do it's fully saturated, fluorescent, and stands out like nobody's business, turning a woman's lips into something almost frightening.Rush is also responsible for some extraordinary shots that needlessly call attention to themselves. A crushed body lies bleeding on a New York street, and Rush places the camera several feet BENEATH the corpse and shoots upward through a transparent pavement.The story itself is quite well done, carried along as much by the performers as by the plot. Jane March shows up to become Willis' main squeeze and play a pivotal role at the end. There is considerable gratuitous nudity which I enjoyed immensely. Not Bruce Willis' butt, to which I'm totally indifferent, but March's slender, girlish figure.It's a decent mystery but has a couple of flaws, one of them lethal. Among the gigs are two pointless car chases through the streets of Los Angeles -- and I mean pointless because nothing comes of either. In another scene, Willis' car is pushed out of a high-rise parking lot and almost crushes him on the ground ten stories below. He escapes the falling vehicle and the mass of flying wreckage it creates by running away from it, in slow motion, towards the camera. (Ho hum.) The plot is full of hidden holes, so many and so subtle that they slip by almost unnoticed. Egs., how can Willis simply move into his friend's mansion, drive his car, and in effect take over his identity. He had a license to practice in New York state. Now he decides, on a whim, to practice in California? Without wrestling with red tape from the state and from the rabid and proprietary American Psychological Association? The difficulties aren't even alluded to. The APA wouldn't even let me become a member, let alone a fellow, although I have a doctorate in clinical psychology. They didn't like the school I'd gone to. The plot was sometimes so turgid that I was lost. (Maybe a second viewing.) The climactic confrontation involves the deployment of a nail gun and an electric drill and the circumstances destroy the movie completely, turning it into an ill-conceived and confusing action movie with thunder and lightning, tottering on the lip of a long fall, and all the other accouterments. What a disappointment.Nope. This isn't The Stuntman. But I'm reluctant to blame the film's weaknesses on the director alone. He hadn't made a movie in fourteen years and it's very likely that the producers kept him on a tight leash. It happens. In The Godfather, the scene in which Carlo beats hell out of his pregnant wife, using a belt, was not Francis Ford Coppola's idea. The producers insisted on an action scene at that point in the story because they were afraid it might otherwise be too sluggish for the audience. I can easily imagine something like that happening here.The characters are diverse and colorful, mostly in a quiet way, but Ruben Blades' cop enlivens every scene he's in -- profane, ironic, earthy. Jane March is a dish. She shares something with another cast member, Leslie Ann Warren. Their grins are filled with gleaming chiclets, the size of squares on a chess board. Between the two of them, they could gnaw through an iron bolt as easily as a corn cob at an Iowa picnic.

This movie can't please anyone, but which movie can?There were some rather good psychiatric thrillers in last ten years (like Final Analysis), and this one isn't better or worse.  So if you like psychiatrists included in crime - as victims, witnesses, investigators, forensics, this is O.K. for you.  If you don't mind sex or murder in a movie, but prefer first, you have a good proportion here.  And I don't mind some car chasing if it's not the main point of the movie.  There are some dozens of broken cars, but in just one (long) sequence, so if it's not enough for you, don't start watching.  If you like violence, shooting, fighting, this one is definitively not for you.I saw a 134' version on TV - is it short or long one?  It didn't seem to be cut.  Willis&March scenes were beautiful, one of the most beautiful and most erotic for me (but everybody has his own scale that depends on what he likes both in movies and in life, his feelings, behaviour, religiosity, sexual orientation, culture etc so it's useless to compare them).I knew who the killer was about half a minute after he appeared on screen, but the motive was hidden till the end, and that's what surprised me.  But after reading so many Agatha Christie's and watching so many who-did-it movies (and so many with psychiatry included) I usually guess quickly. There was one thing I didn't expect.  When a private detective, doctor, taxi driver or anyone out of police starts investigating he is always more clever and more successful than the policemen.  But here, though Willis leads his investigation, it's Martinez who keeps everything (including Willis) under control.  It hasn't been shown or said, but it seems obvious that he gave informations to Willis (telling them himself or sending Anderson to do it) when he found it convenient and when it was helping him.  So Willis is not such a super-hero he (and most other amateur detectives in this genre) usually is.  And I like Willis more in such type of a role; for years I didn't watch his movies because he was supposed to be only an action hero.  Bakula is O.K. like always (how should a psychiatrist look like?).  March had more interesting character in The Lover, the script didn't get her much chance here, but she did very good what she was expected to do.  The therapy group maybe looks like Dear John group, some characters (Clark!) are stereotypes. but people like them exist (though a therapist with such a group probably wouldn't wait to be killed, he'd do it himself).This film is not bad at all, it is between good and very good, but only if your answers on my if-s are positive.

As a whodunit, or who's doing it, it works well...as a slice of life, it's not there at all. Knowing that Richard Rush hadn't made a movie in years, is a perfectionist, has a weak heart, and that the film had been recut a million times (no doubt due to bad previews since Rush didn't have the power to control the cut despite bad reactions), I think it's safe to say that the whole project didn't have a chance to survive.

A film that fails at pretty much everything it aspires, but manages to become compulsively viewable to see how much further a train wreck it can become and, by some strange twist, actually attains a level of guilty entertainment value it really does not deserve. Blending together the elements of a psychological Hitchcock thriller with the eroticism of Basic Instinct/Fatal Attraction/late night Cinemax films, the filmmakers end up with a conglomeration that was probably a far cry from what they intended, particularly given that director Richard Rush was actually a director of some reputation. Psychologist Bruce Willis has gone color blind since his inept attempts at counseling led to the unintentional suicide of a patient. He decides to seek solace with an old colleague Scott Bakula, who ends up murdered. Police seem to believe that the culprit is one of the participants of the group therapy sessions that Bakula oversaw and Willis steps in to ferret out the culprit. Meanwhile, Willis crosses paths with enigmatic young sexpot Jane March who may be more involved than he suspects. The group therapy sessions are a great source of unintentional comedy. Made up of fairly reliable character actors like Lance Henriksen, Kevin O'Connor and Lesley Ann Warren, all seem to realize that they are in glorified garbage and find intriguing ways in which to embellish their characters and hog the screen. In between, comical therapy sessions, Rush inserts an obligatory chase scene, a bloody murder, or an energetic sex romp between the leads. No one can ever accuse the film of being a bore. Unfortunately the ham factor does not extend to the leads. March has been handed a virtually unplayable part filled with assorted pitfalls, and even the more remedial elements seem out of her reach. She never seems vampish enough to attract the kind of attention bestowed upon her in the film. Even worse, March's distinctive looks render a latter-film plot twist psychotically absurd when the audience has been leagues ahead of everyone else on screen and the respective characters' bafflement seems downright jaw-dropping. Much press was spilled about the torrid sex scenes compiled for the film, including much ballyhooed full frontal exposure from leading man Willis, but the leads generate no sparks. I give Willis credit for a) generously stepping up to the plate and showing substantial skin at a time when most American mainstream leading men would have run in the opposite direction, and b) trying to play the lead role seriously, but he is positively lifeless in this film. One has no rooting interest in either his relationship with March, his ability to counsel his patients, or whether he will even make it out of the various chase/attack scenes in one piece. He has rendered himself into a virtual stick of wood devoid of any emotion. Yet, in spite of its miscast and outmatched leads and the thoroughly incompetent direction, the film has that car accident quality that keeps one watching well past the point where it should be turned off. The conclusion is pure Grand Guignol corn with a bit of a cheat on the murderer, but what an unintentionally hilarious loony ride it is to that point.

They each spent, for one reason or another, a considerable length of time away from behind the cameras but, while the first four each bounced back with considerable achievements, Richard Rush gave us the universally-reviled COLOR OF NIGHT. Rush is hardly fit to stand in the company of such mavericks but his short filmography is not uninteresting and he did give us one undisputed modern classic, THE STUNT MAN (1980), a career-high for him (earning even a Best Direction Academy Award nod) and which, ironically, he made just before that prolonged hiatus. Truth be told, he did make a fascinating feature-length documentary about the production woes he had to suffer through on that picture but still, after some 16 years in the wilderness, one expects better... Which is not to say that COLOR OF NIGHT is a total flop - despite its having nabbed the Razzie Award for Worst Film of the Year. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at how perversely enjoyable the film eventually was...sometimes for all the wrong reasons, of course! Anyway, while the premise - starting with their psychoanalyst, the components of a group therapy at a swank L.A. suburb is being targeted by a knife-wielding assassin - could have been worked out into an effective neo-noir, this certainly isn't it. For starters, the atmosphere is all wrong and, even if they get to engage in some pretty laughable sex scenes, there's no chemistry between leads Bruce Willis (playing the replacement shrink, he even gets to show his manly assets a couple of times during the film) and Jane March (as a mystery girl); with respect to the suspects/victims, they're such an assortment of wackos and losers - albeit featuring capable actors such as Brad Dourif and Lance Henriksen - as to seem like caricatures (then again, Ruben Blades' performance as the flustered Mexican cop on the case isn't any less hammy)! All in all, it's yet another shameless Hitchcock rip-off by way of BASIC INSTINCT (1992) - with VERTIGO (1958) and PSYCHO (1960) being plundered for the admittedly clever denouement and the climactic cliffhanger even gives a nod towards NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) for good measure - though the film is too slackly-handled to exert much of a grip throughout and it doesn't even have the benefit of a stylish veneer a' la the work of Brian De Palma. In short, it is merely preposterous and overblown...all the way from Dominic Frontiere's music score to the version I watched actually turning out to be an unheralded Director's Cut, running 17 minutes longer than theatrical-release prints!

So they decided they'd put everything they've got together to make up the time.Honestly, as you watch the film, you can identify the clear quality changes as well as mood changes. I found it hard to believe it was even directed by a single director. The story lacks emotions, performance, intelligence, believability, continuity, purpose, character... the list can go on. I give you one thing though, the film did have a professional look in terms of photography, but only at an average level.Thing is though, despite being such a bad film, I did watch it throughout for one reason. I just wanted to find out what the script writer(s) came up with next. You can so blatantly tell that the writer just had a new idea at some point of the story, and forces it into the script and touches up the rest of the plot a little to justify it. Unfortunately while it was entertaining to see so much new material throughout the film, it just made the film fall apart even more. So I dunno, I found it fun as an experience, though I ain't sitting through it again unless I'm pointing and laughing at it with my friends next time it comes on TV.The sex scenes, I didn't ignore them. Thing is, they were explicit, but they were... well since it's an 18 film... I dare say they're just s**t. The sex scene were badly composed and directed, lacking either the passion you see from love stories, or the energy in porn films. It was just crap, period.The cast was completely wasted in this movie, including Bruce. Each character were linear and stereotyped, which failed each actor's better credited performances in films of their respective genres.

Brief synopsis of Dr. Bill, played by Bruce Willis I usually like most of his work attempting to get over a patient of his leaping out of his office window 50 floors high while in a session.  Upon going color blind from the experience blood red now looks gray to him he visits friend, Dr. Bob played by Scott Bakula in a minor role who gets murdered in a slashing scene that is quite real.  Dr Bill takes over Dr. Bob's group therapy class one of them being the murderer - we think which consists of some fine actors, namely Lesley Ann Warren, Brad Dourif, Lance Henderson and Kevin J. O'Connor all of which have some sort of sexual hang-up.  Then by chance up pops the likes of Jane March, who bares all, tells all and evidently does all.  As Dr Bob and his Miss Rose are doing it in the pool, the hallway, the floor, the shower and eventually the bed, the plot begins to thicken, although I guessed some of the surprises quite early.  The make-up wasn't that clever.  It was the buck teeth that gave it away in my book.  Miss March has a nice body, but her teeth need capping.  It was an annoying smile.  The sex scenes were obviously the reason this movie made it as far as it did.  Mr Willis certainly doesn't lack in that department.  What a tusch!However I found it hard to swallow pardon the pun.  It seemed too far fetched to be believable that these patients were walking the street. Director Richard Rush did what he could.  However, I feel he could have improved on Miss March's performance.  She was that bad.  A near perfect body does not make an actress.  It was also sad to see the likes of Shirley Knight and Jeff Corey in such nothing roles.  What a waste of good talent.

I didn't either, but there is at least one interesting thing about it, its provenance.Its an old fashioned locked house mystery, patterned after the Agatha Christie model. You have some sort of artificial constraint that sets the rules there is a murderer and you know it is one among a small group. As the story goes, you discover that each person has some hidden side that may lead to the explanation that they are the murderer. The detective, in this case a psychologist, is hampered in that he has a condition similar to the broken souls he is counseling. It makes it difficult for him to see on our behalf. In true Agatha tradition, the real murderer is revealed to be someone, and to rely on some causes, that are so unexpected we smile when they are revealed. The red in the red herring here is sex. The diversions that pull us away all have to do with sexual fantasy. This is, needless to say, not a device that Agatha would have used, but it is most welcome here because it isn't just sex that is used to distract us its that special kind that comes from cinematically- generated romantic target stories.In fact, if you know films, you may know one of the most successful and lovely of the projects that simply and directly takes you one of these romantic, bodily encounters that actually ends but remains sweet. Its The Lover, and stars as the target of attention a young Jane March. Its a different twist than here, where she takes on several characters in one body, but the overall shape is the same, emotionally as well as the skinform.There's incompetence in how it is delivered to us, but the way it is structured is very, very sweet, and continues the narrative tradition of the detective story into more modern terms. It probably is important in that respect and though it doesn't directly reward us, I'll bet that its a big step in the evolution of the form that has given us stuff we really do like.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

This is so traumatic to him, he becomes color blind. He travels to Los Angeles to visit his old college chum Scott Bakula, who invites Bruce to sit in on his Monday night group session. Here we meet five neurotics, and later Bakula tells Willis that one of them have been threatening his life. Soon, Bakula is murdered and the cop investigating the crime (Ruben Blades) asks Willis to take over the group and try to find the killer.This had to be one of the most ridiculous and unrealistic films I have ever seen. It started out interestingly, but very quickly soured. I don't know if a person can be traumatized into color blindness, but it seems unlikely. And the colorblindness had nothing to do with the plot or with Willis' character. Big deal, he's colorblind.Ruben Blades was simply awful as the foul cop. To show how foul this cop is, Willis and Blades are walking along the street when a man accidentally bumps into Blades. Blades pushes the man against a car and frisks him, while never breaking his conversation with Willis. That's one tough cop! And why does Willis move into Bakula's very nice house after Bakula's murdered? I don't know if I'd want to stay in my murdered friend's house.And the plot twists are so incoherent, so unbelievable, so ludicrous, that they are unintentionally funny.

Lance Henriksen (who should stick to sci-fi/horror) is the only one who actually delivers a decent performance, but his screen time is too limited to make any difference.As everyone here knows, this one was the subject of a major battle with the MPAA, due to the sex scenes. The ratings board threatened to slap it with an NC-17 rating, forcing the studio to trim it by fifteen minutes.However, the rating was later appealed in time for its video release, which is the version most people have seen it in. I haven't seen the general release print (125 min), but I can safely say it's no improvement. It might be even worse. It goes on forever, that's for sure.I suspect the reason the director's cut eventually made it out with an R rating is because the good folks at the MPAA realized it's just too bad to be taken seriously.

I hated it then. The pacing was turgid, the acting laughable and you could see some of the plot twists from a mile off. No, this was a terrible movie.Wll, a couple of months I bought the DVD Richard Rush's flick The Stunt Man at a sale. I really dug that one and when I found out that Rush also had done Color of Night, and that the Bruce Willis vehicle was his only movie that he had made after The Stunt Man, I became intrigued...So, I decide to rent it and after seeing it again It still sucks, but it's not that terrible. The pacing still seems a mile off and some of the acting is truly terrible (Scott Bakula and the one who played the cop are especially frighteningly awful), but some of the acting was not as terrible as I had thought. Jane March and Lesly Anne Warren seem to camp it up in a fabulous way and their scene together is fantastic and hilarious. Also, Richard Rush seems to have incorporated themes and styles from the Stunt Man into this. The same kind of lighting and music which were wonderful in The Stunt Man can also be seen and heard here. But where as the circus music heard in Th Stunt Man was appropriate during the stunt scenes, in Color of Night they are played during the therapy session scenes. It just does not work as the cast are...uh..colorful enough. Putting that music on the soundtrack makes it stupid instead of funny; it misses a punchline. The script is terrible with far too many loose ends. The denouement is filled with very talky ex-positional dialogue. It seems to shot in a re-shoot, as the characters fall over themselves to kill or save each other, while trying to fill the plot holes. Also, the characters don't seem to mourn over the people that die in the course of this movie; are they really that shallow or was that footage thrown out by the director?Bruce Willis also is not good. He seems too jokey and relaxed in the serious scenes. It's only, surprisingly, during the romantic scenes with Jane March that he is on a roll. I never took him for a charmer, but he seems to have plenty of charm during those scenes. Still, Color of Night has a campy attitude in some places and is beautifully lit.

It features a story that could have been decent had some modicum of thought been put into it or if the execution or direction had any inspiration behind it.  Instead, we have an over-the-top thriller that lacks in creating a moment of genuine tension.Psychologist Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) temporarily leaves his profession after he accidentally persuades a woman to commmit suicide, leaving him blind to the color red (please don't ask, it doesn't make any more sense to me than it would to you).  He visits his friend Bob Moore (Scott Bakula), who's also a psychologist, and he's worried because he's been receiving death threats from who he believes to be one of five of his most seriously disturbed patients.Moore is killed one night, in a gruesome fashion as he is repeatedly stabbed over and over.  Capa immediately suspects one of the five patients as the murderer.  Could it be oddball Casey, sex addict Sondra, transsexual Richie, obsessive compulsive Clark, or the troubled Buck, whose wife and daughter were killed.  As Capa investigates, he meets a mysterious woman named Rose (Jane March), and they develop a passionate relationship.  Eventually, Capa's search for the truth leads him to a shocking discovery.Director Richard Rush sure does take his time in developing this movie (or the lack thereof).  At 140 minutes, it goes on far too long though it could have been a bearable experience had it featured some suspenseful moments or had more erotic and steamy scenes.  Instead, what we have is a mess of a thriller, one that is virtually nil of suspense.  Even the copious amount of blood during the murder does little to jolt you.  And it's made all the goofier by Willis' character's red color blindness.The execution of the erotic scenes is far, far better and Color of Night does have its very steamy moments.  Most notable is the first sexual tryst between Willis and March, which begins in a swimming pool, continues in bed, and finishes in the shower.  Thus, the only thing there is to puncture the monotony afterward is the occasional gratuitous shot of Jane March's shapely curves.One of the film's worst problems is how over-the-top it gets, particularly during the scenes with the disturbed patients.  The script's stupidity is all the more noticable during these moments when all the characters spout off some truly inane dialogue.  Composer Dominic Frontiere's bloated score doesn't help, either, which sounds like music more suitable for a carnival or a Bela Lugosi movie.The acting is another hindrance. Bruce Willis as the disturbed psychologist is decent (as always) but the script often keeps him from accomplishing anything further.  Jane March is easily one of the sexiest actresses I've seen and her performance is okay, with a lot of the fault also coming from the script.  Everybody else either registers bland or overacts to embarrassing extents (to the point where I'm surprised Lesley Ann Warren, Brad Dourif, and Kevin J. O'Connor are still working).There is a plot twist at the end of Color of Night.  I suspected a little through the first 20 minutes that that was what the twist would be, yet found myself saying no to myself because it just seemed too implausible, ridiculous, and even downright creepy in all the wrong ways.  What do you know, I was right.  The description of the twist also seems to fit the rest of the movie.    "},{"Title":"Full frontal Jane March nudity.

His star had, without question, stopped shining for a number of years but Tarantino's finest film rescued him from the Hollywood scrap-heap. Bruce Willis hadn't faded as much but the signs were there that Hollywood's favourite wise-cracking meat-head was beginning to run out of steam. One need only look at this ridiculously stupid thriller to see what I mean.Willis plays Bill, a New York psychiatrist who is so good according to those around him that the first patient we see him with jumps out of his office window and gets very comfortable with the road outside. Traumatised by this, Bill goes to LA to visit fellow shrink and best buddy Bob (Scott Bakula and it's nice to know they spent literally minutes thinking up character names, isn't it?) and his assorted group of patients who are affectionately known as the Monday Night Group. Bill's bad luck follows him, though, as Dr. Bob quickly comes a cropper too. Lt. Martinez (Rubén Blades) believes that one of the Monday Night Group is responsible so Bill reluctantly takes over the group. Away from therapy, Bill is entranced by the beautiful Rose (elfish rake Jane Marsh) but sadly for Bill, he can't figure out what's going on as quickly as we can.This year has been kind to me so far, movie-wise. I've seen Hero (rated 8 on my scale), The Incredibles (an impressive 10) and Shaun Of The Dead (a very funny 9), among others. I've being feeling a bad film coming for some time and sadly, this is it. This is one of the worst examples of a thriller I've seen for a long time. The plot is so laughable that it stops being funny and the fact that not one character can tell who the killer is (or even produce a single lead at all) is a staggering insult to the viewers intelligence. With better leads, this might have been pulled off but Willis and Marsh are dreadful. Willis is sleep-walking through the lines and all too ready to bare his bits when it's not really necessary. In truth, you'd have to be looking for them to tell and I'm afraid that Marsh's frequent nudity provided enough distraction, although the Emanuelle style soft-porn soundtrack didn't help. She seems quite happy to show her arse at the drop of a hat. Brad Dourif and Lance Henriksen are good enough as two suspects / patients but neither are really stretching themselves, both being much finer actors than anyone else on set.There really is quite a lot not to like about this film. I spent most of the movie screaming at the TV who the killer was but by the time of the great unmasking, things had got so wildly silly that I simply didn't care any more. And truth be told, I wasn't that bothered to begin with. The story is poor, the acting is worse, the production is hammy and uninspired. Even the misspelled title (in Queen's English, anyway - when will you learn, America?) has no bearing at all on the film's plot or, in fact, anything at all. The ending, grateful relief though it is, merely solidifies this film's reputation for me of being one great clunker. There really is nothing to see here, unless you're that eager to catch a glimpse of Willis's member. And if that is the sole recommendation of a film, imagine how bad the rest of it must be!

The most annoying thing about the production is that the plot hinges on a crucial twist that will be obvious to even the most shortsighted viewer, right from the outset, but we're asked to suspend our disbelief until the very end before said twist is revealed. Nobody in their right mind can do that.Still, despite the paucity of imagination and the silliness of the script, watching this movie turns out to be quite a lot of fun. It's one of those films you can put into the so-bad-it's-good category of entertainment, in that it's filled with unintentional laughs and funny scenes that showcase some OTT acting from most of the cast. Whether it's Bruce Willis's hairpiece or the overblown pool sex scene (although Paul Verhoeven topped that a year later in SHOWGIRLS), COLOR OF NIGHT is frequently amusing.Besides, you have to give the film some credit for its cast alone, a seasoned who's who of '90s-era talent. I particularly like the way the casting director fixed up a bunch of well-known genre actors in supporting roles; well done that man!

Jane March is pretty and alluring, but is she out of her depth in a psychologically complex part? I think so! Director Richard Rush started out making trash movies '60s and his mindset is evident in the cheesy stalk-n-slash sequences and overblown stylistics on offer here.

The film will provide all of the above for the brave viewer. ***SPOILERS RAMPANT*** Willis plays a psychiatrist who loses a patient to suicide (before his eyes) and develops red color blindness and feels he can't practice any longer. (The color handicap is used more for visual effect than story.) He flies to L.A. to visit buddy Bakula (also a psychiatrist) whose entire practice apparently consists of a Monday night group therapy session! This passel of loons includes obsessive-compulsive Dourif, nymphomaniac Warren, masochist O'Connor, depressive Henrikson and a gender confused boy named Richie. These five chew the scenery endlessly with their pat problems and overripe dislike for each other. Everyone takes their turn proving that they can cry. Bakula and Willis display a fascinating homoerotic friendship in which they can barely keep their hands off each other all the while discussing sexy women. (Note the bike scene in which Bakula is conveniently smeared with white dust over his clingy bike shorts, revealing the outline of his genitals.) Unfortunately, this is cut short when Bakula is savagely murdered...possibly by one of the group members. Willis takes over the group and almost simultaneously is seduced by a half naked (and thereafter nearly always naked) March. The lunacy continues as these two undergo some of the most ridiculously funny sex scenes and strange kinks. (March, immediately after orgasm, insists that Willis dress up. He gets in a suit, she cooks him dinner and they don't eat it, but resume lovemaking!) It is during their first encounter in the pool that Bruce, jr pops up for a very brief cameo (this is ONLY in the director's cut which is mercilessly 17 minutes longer than the theatrical release. This glimpse is less than 2 seconds of it. The rest is interminable babble and some March skin scenes.) More phallic imagery appears (Willis is spread eagle on the ground while a rattlesnake hovers between his legs, a building with a huge spindly tower has the word erection painted on the side, etc...) As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that each of the therapy members has a new love who meets all of their needs. Then it becomes clear that all of the loves are actually ONE PERSON! Here is the thing....one of the performers is called upon to enact no less than three parts in the film. However, due to the extremely distinct facial structure of the performer, there is never any chance that this will be pulled off! Yet the director treats it like a huge surprise when it is revealed. Many people saw through this in the TRAILER!! ANYONE would have been able to do this better than the actor chosen. (The performance is not that bad, it's just that it is physically impossible for the person to pull off.) Stay tuned for an uproarious cameo by Shirley Knight. The full weight (literally) of her method training is too much for this flimsy movie. She emotes and flutters and twirls and crawls all over the room, vehemently protesting the treatment Willis is giving her (he has merely knocked on her door!) She is the comic highlight of the film. The entire thing is so implausible, ludicrous and yet irresistible that, as long as one knows what he or she is in for, there will be an evening of laughs and a tad of titillation. The title seems to have no relation to the film, except that color is well used in the film...but why Color of NIGHT??

He switches coasts to visit his friend Bob Moore (Scott Bakula), another shrink, in California, but things take an unexpected turn when Moore is brutally murdered and Capa decides to take over his therapy group.  At the same time Capa begins a relationship with Rose (Jane March), a mysterious young woman who seems to know more than she should about both Capa and Moore.Director Richard Rush hadn't made a movie in 14 years when he did this one, and he's no Kubrick or Malick in emerging from isolation.  The movie is one hackneyed cliché after another, with boring car chases and exceedingly gratuitous, drawn-out sex scenes.  (It's bad enough that March looks about 12.)Furthermore, the movie relishes giving away its surprises ten minutes or so before it actually gives them away.  March plays three characters, and when they are definitively revealed, they could only come as a surprise to someone who wasn't paying attention.  And Moore's murder, fifteen minutes or so into the film, is set up for about five minutes before it happens with Moore alone in his office as winds start to blow in and lights randomly go out.Color of Night is a poor excuse for a thriller, and it doesn't provide any suspense.  It's best at providing gratuitous nudity and a rattlesnake-in-the-mailbox scene, which is depressingly its biggest chill, is ripped directly from The Player.  Only someone who wanted to see a lot of Jane March's body would have any good reason to see this movie.

Not only is every move telegraphed by the ponderous soundtrack, the plot is so contrived that it is utterly predictable. I had a great time with my friends figuring out what would happen which we did halfway through the movie. They tried so hard to make it unusual it wound up being easy to guess.The plot is lame, the dialogue hackneyed and the car chases look like they were designed by a 14 year old - with every cool' gimmick in the Hollywood Car Chase Handbook. The sex scenes, gratuitous at best, must have been done by the same teen-age boy.We were screaming at the TV saying Oh please, do NOT show us Bruce's ... but alas, we were not to be spared.The overwhelming tragedy in the whole enterprise is that the supporting cast, as talented a bunch as you'll ever get in a group (with the exception of Jane March), must have needed work desperately to sign up for this mess. If the likes of Brad Dourif, Lance Henrickson, Kathleen Wilhoite, Leslie Ann Warren and Rubén Blades cannot rise above the material you know it's crap - though they do make a valiant effort. Eriq la Salle is mercifully spared a lot of exposure in this pre-ER effort and what there is for him is really hard to ruin. Scott Bakula's murder at the beginning was a mercy-killing for the likeable actor.Bruce Willis looks great - but he really has to avoid any films that completely lack humor - he is stilted and uncomfortable and you can see he is trying desperately to keep his trademark smirk from popping out.It does have the potential to become a cult semi-classic - I can imagine people screaming at the screen and the thing is worth watching if only for the nail-gun stuff.

Traumatized by the event, he travels to L.A. to visit an ill-fated doctor friend (Scott Bakula), who's promptly murdered. Hmmm... Could the killer be one of the weirdos from Bakula's Monday night group therapy sessions? Willis tries to discover who's responsible but puts aside plenty of time to soak in the in-your-face, goo-goo come-ons of pouty sexpot Rose (Jane March).Rush's first film since his acclaimed thriller THE STUNT MAN is one big washout story-wise, with ludicrous dialogue and stupid plot developments, plus it goes on forever and has poor work from a completely unsympathetic Willis, an amateurish March and an obnoxious Ruben Blades as the lead cop on the case. So what earns this any stars? Three great character actors in good enough form to elevate this mess to guilty pleasure status; Brad Dourif as an obsessive compulsive lawyer, Lance Henriksen as a embittered man whose family was murdered and Lesley Ann Warren as an insatiable nymphomaniac. All three are great fun to watch in their scenes and the film comes to life when they're on screen. Otherwise it's really not that memorable unless you desperately want to see Bruce Willis' flaccid penis bobbing up and down in the water for about five seconds. That particular scene was cut to keep this from getting an NC-17 rating in theaters (where it flopped), but has been restored for the home video release. Oddly, the fully uncut version of the film reverted back to the R rating once it hit video stores, even though the R-rated video version is identical to the NC-17 theatrical version.

The ending is not as obvious as everyone thinks, remember when you first saw the film at the theatre? The locations, makeup and lighting were all spectacular. As was the casting. The cinematography was very sound.The editing was absolutely second to none. I think this is also due to the nature of the dialogue and screenplay.Like its subject matter, the editing of this film and interplay of the characters together with the camera work, works like the human memory. Unlike Memento, which has a gimmick, this film doesn't need any gimmick to work as an experience of shared memories which we are all vaguely familiar with in present day life.Because of the nature of the images and dialogue working like the human mind and memory, I really believe that this is a great film and much underrated in my view.

Almost immediately a close friend/fellow psychiatrist (Scott Bakula) is brutally murdered one night in his office after some death threats. It appears that one of the patients in his group (a group which includes Lance Henriksen, Brad Dourif, Lesley Anne Warren, among others) may indeed be the culprit, but which one or ones? Willis, almost forgetting himself, falls in with the highly erotic Jane March and a relationship built on steamy and seemingly constant sexual escapades develops. At first March seems to have nothing to do with the initial story, but soon she proves to be a key part of this movie (in more ways than one). All the while the investigation of Bakula's murder hits a fevered pitch with detectives Eriq LaSalle and Ruben Blades. Is Willis in over his head or can he save himself and others threatened before his time runs out? Color of Night is one of the oddest experiences I have ever had when it comes to the movies. Sometimes uniqueness warrants excellence, but that is not the case here. Odd-ball situations, a story that really eats itself alive and terrible direction by the once-great Richard Rush drown the whole production. The performers are left to suffer through this interminable mess that just goes further down the road of obscurity as it continues its pointless journey. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).

The so bad it's good comments about some movies are kind of silly, but maybe that's the reason that this movie is so much garbage, yet I tend to watch it for a while whenever it's on.
