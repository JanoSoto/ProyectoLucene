Snipes made me laugh my heart out, and Leguizamo had a dark undertone to his performance that reflects the hopes and dreams of many Latinas living in poverty. I also admire the intentions of this movie. It wants to bring a message without offending or turn off the audience it intends to deliver it to. Not an easy task, but at least it's an admirable attempt. I think some of the reviewers on this site are a bit too harsh on this film. It is a fun bubble gum of a movie. Watch it and enjoy it, and in the process if you come away from it with a little more of an open mind, I think it has done its job.

The premise of having three macho actors take on the roles of drag queens to put together a very funny and insightful comedy of the sexes must have appeared as an impossible task. In the end, the film works because of its tight screenplay and its well defined characters. Swayze, Leguizamo, and Snipes hold nothing back, making each character real and multi dimensional. There are elements of farce, hilarity, outrageousness, and some very daring moves from its three leads. With the help of a strong supporting cast that includes Stockard Channing, as a battered woman, the film moves along quite nicely.It's a fantasy with a firm hold in reality. The leads portray three human beings that must confront what society deals them, and in the film, they manage to make some of their dreams come true. Unlike other movies dealing with special types of love, such as Beautiful Thing and Big Eden where the ending perfectly matches the rest of the fantasy, this one faces reality and offers an interesting type of compromise. It's bittersweet, expertly interweaving both the possible and impossible.Leguizamo shines as the very caliente latina persona who lives dangerously and tries to fit in, in her own special way. Swayze is the classy one, who is not allowed to forget her true nature. Wesley Snipes' role borders on caricature, but he keeps it from crossing the line between farcical and ridiculous. They all do very good work with this very risqu√© and difficult material. It works out.

Still, Snipes and Swayze are fabulous, hilarious, and courageous to risk their testosterone-driven careers on such a romp. But John Leguizamo, as the drag princess, steals the show, no small feat considering the supporting cast includes Robin Williams, Stockard Channing, Blythe Danner, Melinda Dillon, Arliss Howard, and, of course, the statuesque Julie Newmar.Much has been made of the similarity between this film and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but each stands on its own for many reasons. Each presented superb casts in stories with obvious similarities. But oh the differences. Completely different approaches to humor, not to mention drag. Also, To Wong Foo is a more pleasant if somewhat more lightweight movie. The American audience probably had a much easier time with this one than with Priscilla.

It's all about how men, even homosexual men, perceive women, as opposed to the reality of women and their lives.It's a trenchant though gentle and very funny lesson in gender politics. These actors are brilliant in their portrayal of all of the superficial attributes of women. Every time I see the movie, I'm amazed at their performances - and at the insight and depth of the text.This movie suggests the impossibility of separating the external gloss of femininity from its source - women themselves. And that women are not the sum of their feminine mannerisms, but whole people who are still too often subgugated by men.The drag queens are so much more female than any genuine woman they meet. But because they are actually men, they enjoy the power of their masculine gender to construct and control their lives that is unobtainable for the women. The 'girls' end up defending the real women in the movie in a way that is more 'gallant' than any Knight in Shining Armor. Their homosexuality fosters a compassion and understanding of the lot of women in a way that the 'manly' men in the movie cannot grasp. And perhaps the 'girls' end up with a more complete notion of femininity as well. I treasure this movie because I am so grateful for its message.This flip, light little movie really deserves close examination. Magnificent performances and real heart. Thanks from me too, Julie Newmar!

At the time I remember being amazed at how absolutely feminine and lady-like Patrick Swayze was. I also remember that it was a nice story the wouldn't offend anyone.I watched To Wong Foo....again and once again I watched while Patrick Swayze turned himself into Ms. Vida Boheme and then throughout the rest of the movie I kept studying this character in all of the different outfits - complete with matching hats, shoes and gloves - that she wore and kept asking myself, How can that possibly be Patrick Swayze? The three stars; Swayze, Wesley Snipes (Ms. Noxeema Jackson) and John Leguizamo (Chi-Chi Rodriquez) we just terrific as drag queens who head out for Hollywood and end up in a small town when their car breaks down. he town is old and appears almost as if it were shot in black and white until the queens find some old 60's clothes in the dry goods store and then the town is transformed into a decorated masterpiece.The movie is fun and has a do-good message that is up-lifting. There are a lot of other actors with little important roles that make the movie. Stockard Channing has an excellent role and Robin Williams has a cameo that was great.Noxeema Jackson and Chi-Chi are really typical RuPaul drag queens in this movie but Swayze's character is such a lady that is difficult for me to even relate other movie images of Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing (Johnny), City of Joy (Max), Father Hood (Jack) and others) to this character. Perhaps if a Wesley Snipes fan or a John Leguizamo fan watched this movie they would have the same reaction to these actors' characters as I have had to Patrick Swayze's character - amazement and discomfort.

Or the fact that despite the fact that for some of the subject matter exposed here, nothing quite serious was made of it. Nevertheless, I will say that from start to escapist finish, the movie was fun, entertaining, and quite daring if for the presence of three macho actors effectively playing drag queens (and never allowing us to see them in any other form).Like I said, the premise of this movie has been done to death highly different people come to a small town (by accident), see the problems there, and manage in the course of their stay to get townsfolk to get in touch with themselves. It's a premise seen in such films as Pasolini's TEOREMA which had a different yet similar premise where a stranger gets inside a household and manages to somehow change every person there. Of course, that film was risky; this one, while featuring drag queens, is not. But my guess is that the intentions of the writer and director was not to attack social issues (such as spousal abuse, or Vida's estrangement from her family, for example), but to present them and move on because life is and should be a party.But this course is the movie's fault. That Vida Boheme, Noxema Jackson, and Chi-Chi Rodriguez, in getting lost and winding in a backwoods town where not only do they stumble upon Carol Ann (admirably played by Stockard Channing) who is being abused by her husband (in two particularly uncomfortable scenes, one played off-screen), but where Chi-Chi almost gets raped by the local roughnecks, seems like this should belong in something darker, not a comedy. The fact that on both occasions nothing is resolved (satisfactorily) points towards this movie's failure to step up to the plate, examine those issues, and make something truly revelatory. That what should have been a one-scene situation in which Vida Boheme whacks Sheriff Dollard unconscious is turned into a weak showdown in which neither of the drag queens comes out to make an appearance (like they would under similar circumstances; anyone who knows or has seen drag queens knows that they have little fear of cops or men in uniform and will knock them out easily) only makes matters more false whether or not these townsfolk were latently ready to accept change it is highly unlikely that it would have been played out this way. Why would Dollard even want to arrest these men in drag? It makes little sense but to force the issue that the people will stand up for Those Who Are Different. (And that among those people are the same roughnecks, now wearing pink and read boas? Something is wrong here.) And that Virgil just drives away once Dollard has been humiliated probably can be plausible in a non-verbal, more poetic sense, but again, this is not a poetic movie with suggestive images devoid of dialog, and the reality in spousal abuse is much different than what is left unexplored here. Also unsatisfactorily is the way ChiChi's budding relationship with the local guy (Jason London) is handled why not have him know she is a he and by doing so, take a huge risk that would strike the point home? Maybe it's timing. America isn't ready for men in drag and the chance someone might see through the appearance of femininity a man may have and go with their instincts. If Leguizamo's and London's characters would have hooked up it would have sent the message right onto anyone's lap. Building the gorgeous scenes between them as if to lead the viewer to believe they will become an item only to have ChiChi reject him is a total cop-out. TO WONG FOO is a movie that should have tackled these premises more upfront. It should have given all three of these men an actual sex life, real personalities. The closest thing that happens to romance is some shy flirting from Bobby Ray (Jason London) towards Chi-Chi, but even that is left flat after much exposition. The same way nothing else is said of Vida's familial relationship all we know is that there is an estrangement, but nothing else. And Noxema gets saddled with nothing else but to be there, say one-liners, and chat with an old lady about Hollywood. And this is also, precisely, what keeps it from being a richer movie which explores its characters instead of laying them out to pasture and later dressing them in boas and fancy dresses. To see a drag queen without her make up on is to see the man underneath; since we aren't given that chance here, this is drag-lite, in which all is at surface level, messages of love run rampant as house music plays in the background, and just as it started, it ends in a beauty parade.Kudos to Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze, and John Leguizamo for stepping out of their shoes and donning pumps and wigs. All are great, in equal measure. Snipes manages to channel a lot of Missy Elliott while Swayze might as well have become Brini Maxwell with a red wig. Leguizamo, though, is my favorite. While playing a close rendition of Rosie Perez with a good deal of Jennifer Lopez (pre J. Lo.; look closely and it's there), he gives his character a sweet dimension. These three are the ones who make this movie completely enjoyable despite these complaints that arise once the credits have rolled. Because of them I accepted the (pardon the pun) fairytale ending and its message of love and acceptance, and that takes guts and talent to make it work.

We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens/crossdressers/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination).

The stale countryside housewives dress-up-and-shine concoction is rather self-consciously embarrassing than thematically entertaining while the correlations between various characters is somewhat the thing in its favor, which is completely attributed to a more-than-ordinary cast, particularly Stockard Channing and Patrick Swayze's part, which conspicuously is the corniest one but the punch is potent enough to sense an empathy for them, and Snipe and Leguizamo are incredibly diverting in their muscular and exotically Latin frames respectively. The back story of our three drag-queens (or wait, two queens and one princess) are to a large extent sidelined so as not to hinder its over-optimistic comic vein, which for me could be a more arresting story than the feel-good edification of the inhabitants in a tiny rural town, nevertheless the antithesis is orchestrated with some heartwarming liveliness despite of the predictable turning point. The film merely tells a conventionally orthodox story with an unconventionally mores-defying disadvantaged group. Against its hilarious ethos, my mawkish sentiment prevails as it's hard to accept that both Swayze and Penn have passed away already. ps this is the very last film I have watched in 2011, wish myself and all my friends and lovers an upbeat mood during the whole 2012 and forget the bucket list!

In fact, I had planned on watching this movie during the Super Bowl earlier this year (2013,) since I never watch that game. And what better movie to watch as all the butch action takes place on the tele? (Sadly, something else, no not the game, came up and I just recently thought of watching this again in September 2013.)To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar is one of my all-time favorite movies, hands down. I say that now, even though previously I remember just liking it a ton. This viewing re-sparked the magic, joy, love, dancing &#x96; to one of my favorite soundtracks and ear-to-ear grin I have watching this all over again. I truly loved this movie, the heart, the comedy, the tunes and the snappy one-liners.While the story ain't new, the twist is. Two drag queens and one drag princess travel across the entire United States, from New York to Los Angeles and when their car breaks down in Smalltown, USA, they must spend the weekend in order for the car to get fixed.At first, naturally, they're frightened to what might be considered a redneck, closed-minded rough town, but the very small community do take to them and likewise. They're considered angels for appearing out of nowhere and reenergizing the stalled town.This movie came out in 1995, just about the time when homosexuals (not to mention drag queens) were finally getting recognized, if just a little bit, by the general public as not as threatening as previously slated. Most movies, sadly, dealt with at the time AIDS and sadness for the homosexual community. This 1995 release was a breath of fresh queens with its lightheartedness, fun spirit and messages.Fast forward to 2013. While now even more of majority embraces homosexuals as human beings and more and more basic human rights are rightfully provided to the community, sadly, there is still a large bulk of close-minded people that would still slander a homosexual or worse. This weekend delay in the Midwest small town might be even worse than it was 18 years ago. The same reaction these ladies had in the movie in 1995 would be just as (unfortunately) relevant today.Sadness aside, this movie means a lot to me growing up, especially since I had, myself, just came out three years prior to this release. Again, with all the depressing and countless AIDS indie (or mainstream &#x96; Philadelphia) films, finally, there was a joy to latch onto and lift my spirits. It also helped me feel better about myself and in some instances, get up and dance. (Again, LOVE the soundtrack.)The movie was a fantasy, it's not to be taken seriously, with the exception of the messages and just put out there for fun. The cast, extras and cameos (ohh, Robin was divine!) were magical and perfect. I once read hundreds of well-known macho male stars wanted to fill Vida, Noxeema and Chi-Chi's pumps because they saw the value and the going-against stereotypes that had become. Luckily, they picked the perfect trio in Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo.I laughed out loud again with the ladies, recited most of the lines (despite the years since I've last seen this,) celebrated the lives of both Patrick Swayze and Chris Penn &#x96; which lives were cut far too short and it was painful to see them both in several scenes together, and yeah, I did get up and dance.

The title refers to a autographed photo of Julie Newmar that the ladies carry with them on their journey. Although the plot is uneven and many promising scenes are not entirely carried out, the trio - Wesley Snipes as Noxeema Jackson, Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme, John Leguizamo as Chi-Chi Rodriguez - gives so wonderful and realistic performances that you easily forget that most of their fame derives from action and sci-fi movies. And their looks... as the year is 1995, then no digital tricks were available, so it was their natural talent and skills that are convincingly visible on screen. Apart from them, there are multiple pleasant cameo appearances, providing an additional value to the movie.Although the topic and depiction are not for everyone, the movie deserves renewed attention and show-time. All this joy, glam and personification let you mostly forget about the plot's shortcomings.

It could have been a disaster in anyone else's hands but with Swayze, Snipes and Leguizamo it works. I don't know if it reflects what being a gay man or a drag queen is all about. To me, it isn't offensive as other mainstream films who don't understand that world and who like to mock it.It can be a little too sweet at times but I think it also tackles subjects that gay men/drag queens have to go through- like getting acceptance from family/strangers and what everyday life can be like for them, the scene that illustrates this the most is when the Sheriff stops the car and Swayze is panicked as his driver's license has a man's name while he is dressed as a woman.I find it interesting that we see the drag queens in their environment at the start of the film where they are surrounded by people who are just like them and who accept them and then they are placed in a completely different environment they are not used to and we see how they are treated and how they fit into the community where they are unique among the residents.I think the three actors did a remarkable job. They all have a different journey in the town after they are forced to stay when their car breaks down. Patrick Swayze as Vida Boheme is so sweet and likes to help people but she has suffered heartbreak in her past with her family not accepting her for who she is. It is nice to see by the end, she is accepted by someone who loves her and who she loves.Wesley Snipe's character Noxeema Jackson is hilarious and delightfully bitchy. Her character starts off as a tough cookie who doesn't trust anyone as she feels they will stab her in the back but she goes through this transformation where she shows a vulnerable side to her character and opens herself up more and learns that not all people will abuse her trust.Chi Chi played by John Leguizamo at times can be very annoying but I liked how his character developed from the start of the movie being very selfish and really trashy and the end where he is more thoughtful of other people's feelings and goes from being a boy in a dress to a full fledged drag queen when he wins the competition in California. I laughed at the spats she would have with Noxeema, it was so funny to watch.On the whole, a very enjoyable and fun film that kept me entertained.Watch out for Robin Williams in an uncredited role at the start and Chris Penn as a nasty Sheriff on the trail of the girls.

Yes, there were some funny lines and the film was basically entertaining but it was not necessarily at the expense of Vida, Noxeema or Chi-Chi. Granted, much of the film was predictable as well and could have accomplished much more - there were many missed opportunities. But, to have men dressed as women, where they weren't portrayed as weird, sick or perverted was a step in the right direction for a world where gender identity issues almost always raise a smirk.

And in the movie it is a way to help straight people that are not use to the gay life style sit back and understand and enjoy is'nt that what movies are made for Mr.IMDb WRITER? For me the word Drag Queen in the movie means men that dress to have fun and live out their lives the way they want to without other caring.The importance of life making yourself happy. I am sure the actors had so much fun doing the movie. Acting with no fears. The magic of acting.Patrick Swayze and Wesly Snipes and John Leguizamo are unbelievable in their roles.

The Aussies do know how to make great films. Muriel's Wedding and Strictly Ballroom can attest to that. Unlike the rest of my friends, I never thought of To Wong Foo as a Priscilla knock-off.The plot of three men traveling across country while learning more about themselves is about all that the two films have in common. If viewed closely, some might find that the message of To Wong Foo is far deeper on a broad social sense than that of Priscilla. For me, To Wong Foo packed a strong social messages throughout. Beauty in life can be found in the ugliest places. Believing in and accepting yourself so that others can do the same. The 4 steps to becoming a drag queen could be seen by some as steps to becoming a better person in general. Overall, the movie gives me a happy whenever I watch it. Life can often be a Snydersville. Both Priscilla and To Wong Foo should be praised for their main purpose. Shedding a little light and positive perspective on a lifestyle that is misunderstood, bashed, maligned, and anything but gay.

For a turn-your-brain-off comedy it sort of works. But I have a hard time turning my brain off when such serious issues are implicated, and handled badly. Wife-beating solved by having someone else beat up the husband and toss him out? Small town folks so dumb? Homosexuals as the usual ridiculous freaks? Women learning how to be women from men? I found it all a tad icky, even in the midst of the celebratory atmosphere.I want to think the lead trio was trying to be nervy, but instead I'm left feeling like they were doing the equivalent of black-face, with all their flailing about coming off like yes massa. The storyline with ChiChi and the local young man is also a bit creepy- reinforcing the myth that gay men are trying to seduce straight men. When similar situations are handled differently, as in The Crying Game and even Priscilla, it is a completely different issue, here it just doesn't work.Snipes is painfully miscast. He is simply too muscle-bound, and then poorly made-up, to be at all convincing. And as others have pointed out, having them exist eternally in full-costume is just silly and unrealistic. And, frankly, a bit stupid- no drag queen I know would set off on a road trip in full drag through parts unknown without fearing for her safety.On the flip side, the movie insults anyone who lives in a small town. Men are dirty, wife-beating, potential rapists. Women are doltish, ignorant, and helpless. Middle America has its issues, but this reinforces a different set of stereotypes for a different audience.The over-all message of acceptance should, however, be commended. I just wish they could have done it a little bit better. I suppose it was trying to be a cartoon, but it creeps me out a little when the cartoon serves to reinforce old stereotypes about all involved.

Upon further reflection, realizing that I really didn't have the knowledge to justify such a charge, and that in any case it probably shouldn't come from an anonymous IMDB poster, I decided to compensate by watching a film I'd heard good things about from my friends, TO WONG FOO, figuring it would probably warrant a positive review. Lo and behold, I was right.I'm not sure WHAT motive Snipes (and Leguizamo and Swayze) had for getting into this film, but I'll grant it certainly took nerve. Their performances are sometimes caricatured, but still too sympathetic to have kept their more homophobic fans from eyeing them suspiciously in 1995. I have to admit Snipes looks ridiculous, but he's quite entertaining, and Swayze and Leguizamo are downright alluring. Too bad they don't do drag more often.This film is often compared to PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, a 1993 Australian piece that is superior in almost every way (except perhaps for the petty, stereotypical squabbling between the three bus travelers. That started annoying me). TO WONG FOO is clumsy and loud by comparison, but it's still funny enough to stand on its own. It actually reminds me more of CLUELESS (also released in 1995) than PRISCILLA; it has similar plot elements and the same kind of innocent gaiety.

After the event they bump into Miss Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo), who is very upset that she hasn't won the contest.The two drag queens are convinced to take Miss Chi Chi with them to compete in the national drag contest however; their prize for winning the local one was only two plane tickets to Los Angeles.  They decide to give up their plane tickets and travel by car so the three of them can go.On their way to Los Angeles, they encounter Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn), who pulls their car over because one of their rear lights is out.  When he asks to see Miss Vida's license, she obviously tries her best to get out of it without having to show the license, bearing in mind the name on her license is Eugene and drag wasn't exactly an acceptable thing in Middle America back then.  The officer takes Vida to one side and starts trying to get fresh with her, believing she is a real woman.  When he reaches up her dress and grabs a hold of her manhood, he suddenly finds himself shocked and flat on his face unconscious in the middle of the road.The three get out of there pretty quickly as they do not really want to face the wrath of an embarrassed sheriff who is sure to want to arrest Vida for rendering him unconscious.  They manage to get a little further until their car breaks down.  Now they are stuck and their only way forward is for Chi Chi to try and hitch a ride.A nice young lad, Bobby Ray (Jason London) pulls up to pick up Chi Chi at the side of the road and is quickly convinced to take her two friends with him too.  He takes them back to his home town, a very small town where everybody knows everybody.They meet Carol Ann (Stockard Channing) who allows them to stay with her and her husband Virgil (Arliss Howard), who is planning on fixing their car however, it will take a couple of days to fix it because the parts are not easy to get hold of.   So now they are faced with a very small town of people, who believe they are real women and they have to keep the act up for three days.  Who knows what kind of reaction they will get if they are found out.Sheriff Dollard is soon on the hunt and is determined to find them and bring them back dead or alive to prove to his fellow officers that they were really men in dresses and he wasn't knocked out by a woman.  He starts his search and it will only be a matter of time before he does eventually find them.Whilst staying at Carol Ann's place, they discover she is the victim of regular domestic abuse, at the hands of her husband Virgil.  After tolerating it for a little while, Vida decides enough is enough and fuelled by the nasty comments thrown at her in an argument with young Chi Chi, she decides to do something about it.  Virgil is thrown out; Carol Ann is now able to be herself and the four start to build a friendship.It doesn't take long for the rest of the town to join in and soon enough, the whole town has been brought together by these three mysterious girls that just appeared.This film is wonderful.  It puts out a message to the whole of the world about how drag queens should be accepted as ordinary people and how everybody in their own right should be able to dress how they like, see who they like and be who they like.  It shows that anyone, no matter how they chose to dress or who they chose to sleep with, can do good and bring people together.Patrick Swayze is relatively funny and surprisingly quite good in drag.  Wesley Snipes is amazing in his role, very funny, very witty and fantastic in drag.  Stockard Channing shows once again that her acting skills are never wasted and plays a very important part in the film and John Leguizamo portrays the part of young Chi Chi very well.This film is one not to be missed.

By 1988, she had firmly started her career in movie making with Vroom, starring a young Clive Owen. During the filming of To Wong Foo Ms Kidron was heavily pregnant, it was Steven Spielberg who was to continue filming, due to insurance, if she had the baby before the end of filming. You also have to remember that the Production Company, Amblin Entertainment, is very much a Steven Spielberg Company.Awards and Nominations do not come short for Ms Kidron, while winning several for her Direction on her television work Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, To Wong Foo had the nomination for the GLAAD Media Award, for most Outstanding Film. To follow, it was nominated for Best Performance for Patrick Swayze and Best Performance for Supporting Role for John Leguizamo for the Golden Globes Award, all during 1996. The writing here is very witty and intelligent, done by Douglas Carter Beane, if its ones liners that you are after then this is the movie for you. Very funny and the delivery is perfect. This writing style could be on the same parallels of a good Carry On movie. The conscious plot is very basic, the three lead roles are driving across America, after two have won a Drag Queen competition in New York, and first prize being automatic entry to the Drag Queen of America in L.A. While driving, their second hand Cadillac breaks down, leaving them stranded for forty-eight hours in a Ghost Town, with only minimum of inhabitants. The local town folk of Snydersville seem to have never ventured out of their own back yard, physically and mentally. This is not a story of quantity but of quality, the plot may be basic, but it's the subconscious plot that truly makes this movie what it is. The longing of Love, friendship and acceptance through ignorance and prejudice. This is where Big City meets Small Town and is a clever example of both, in the end, needing each other. To show that even at polar opposites both can still open each others minds and emotions. To Learn. To Experience. To Connect. The sub plots are excellent, practically the character Sheriff Dollard, played by the late Chris Penn (1965 - 2006), and his hilarious homophobic antics for spiteful revenge. Is that the late Quentin Crisp (1908 - 1999), we see sitting in the China Bowl as one of the Pageant Judge's?

True, MOST drag queens don't dress in drag 24/7, though some do. Also, the explanation that it says men=violence and need to be beaten and women need to be pampered ignores the straight men in the end sequence (watch it and you'll see if you pay attention). (Note that these comments work best if you've read some of the other rather short-sighted comments on here.) Fact is, unless you're in gay society, you will probably miss a lot of the overtly sensitive issues, and can instead realize that it is supposed to be a statement about accepting people and understanding that everyone can contribute something to their lives. If your purpose is to get people to see a glimpse of what gay society is like, you probably won't like this movie. However, if you appreciate the idea of having people dig a little deeper than where they already are and think about things from a different point of view to understand where others are coming from, then you will likely get a good vibe from this one. If you're reading this, you likely have more than a passing interest in possibly watching the movie, so take it from a straight WASP-y (though open-minded) man, it's an important lesson in understanding the people around you and getting a bit outside of yourself.

Finally, the trio is forced to spend the weekend in Thingumabobville, spare parts for an old Cadillac being not readily available.The folks there are as grotesques as the drag queens themselves. At best, men are good fellows afflicted with stuttering (castrating mothers are everywhere it seems), and at worst, husbands that are quick with their hands. Women present a more complex personality, but of course, their minds were deaden by the above-mentioned. It looks like they were desperately waiting for a fairy godmother to blossom. Fortunately, our drag queens are equally at ease in this role and will solve all the ladies' problems by waving a magic wand (actually, this magic wand effect will include some more prosaic kick ups in the backside of male pig chauvinists).To say that this community will never be the same after this colorful hurricane is a euphemism. Thingumabobville will be changed forever, it will be humanized and, above all, its more deeply anchored prejudices (among others, homophobia) will be washed away. The folks will eventually form a league against the vengeful sheriff, pathetically searching these men who took the liberty of wearing women's clothes.

However, Vida takes pity on the young queen Chi-Chi and convinces Noxeema to sell their tickets and buy a car so they can all go to New York together. On the way they get lost and encounter an abusive sheriff, who Vida has to knock out.  They flee the scene but their car dies in a small town.  As they try to fit in until parts arrive for their car, the sheriff starts to track them down.Starting out quite daringly with an entire conference hall full of drag queens, this film quickly gets tame and rather uninteresting.  The opening scene is quite daring and made me, as a straight man, feel a little uncomfortable (which is fine), however it doesn't manage to keep this up and sinks into a rather well worn tread of outsiders coming to a small town and changing it for the best (and being changed by it).  The plot doesn't care that it's characters are drag queens - it only uses this to shape the direction of the `change' and to act as a plot device.  It is still an OK film but it doesn't really do anything special and, in fact, lets a lot of interesting elements slip to one side and be handled rather shoddily.Most notably, Carol Ann's relationship with Virgil is very interesting but is badly sidelined until Vida gets involved.  This section is also where the best acting occurs - Channing is good but it is Howard's insecure bully that I really wanted to see more of.  Swayze is good and makes quite a good drag queen.  Snipes never, never looks like anything other than Wesley Snipes in a dress - he is a rubbish queen and gives a poor (if brave) performance. Leguizamo is OK but is really just doing the usual OTT hamming that has become so very wearing at times.  London is bland and Penn is not that great despite having the funniest scenes (walking round with a list of `places homos would be'!).Overall the film is `flaming' and it takes most of it's humour from that without ever really trying to develop characters beyond the drag queen stereotypes of finger snapping and neck wiggling.  The interesting, more dramatic and serious sides of the film are poorly handled, making them slightly pat and only being used to involve the drag queens in some way. Mildly amusing and is maybe worth a look for the stars in drag, but really I was disappointed.

Its a flawed, but sometimes entertaining hour and 49 minutes.  Swayze is convincing in his drag queen persona when he's just a drag queen, but I don't get any insight into his charachter by the perfunctory allusion to his background.  It doesn't work.  He doesn't give the charachter enough depth in his portrayal to make his ostracism from his affluent family a germane inclusion in the story.  Neither the allusion to his family, nor Swayze's performance leaves me with a better understanding of Vida Boheme's crusade for the underdog.  He is just too schmaltzy. Snipes is okay, and sometimes has his moments, but I don't see his whole heart in his portrayal of Noxeema Jackson.  His fretfulness in the scene where the three are seeking a hotel room contrasts too starkly with the scene where he grabs the balls of the redneck and forces the hillbilly to greet ladies properly.  I'm not convinced his character has gone through any transformation to make this action credible. Leguizamo is not only convincing, but also gives a whole hearted performance as Chi Chi.  (And deserves to win the drag queen contest as she does in Hollywood.)  Where his role falls apart is in his giving up his knight in shining pickup truck.  But this is a problem of the story and script. As to the wife beating subplot; it was unnecessary and too schlocky a portrayal of an important issue to have been included in this story. Neither the husband nor the wife were more than cardboard cutouts.Finally, with the exception of Leguizamo's performance, the timing is just not right in much of the film.  It has lags in the delivery of lines and the editing of scenes that just shouts someone not paying attention! I gave this film a very generous 8 because the story had potentail, and I found it, despite flaws, light entertainment.  But my vote of merit would be 6.

When the producers of Wong Foo found out about Priscilla, they delayed its release so both movies wouldn't be out at the same time.Yes, the characters in Priscilla have more depth and are less cartoonish than those in Wong Foo, but Wong Foo is surprisingly good considering it's Hollywood, and Patrick Swayze makes a *fabulous* drag queen!  Wesley Snipes, on the other hand, was quite out of place; I think Denzel Washington would have made a much better Noxeema.  John Leguizamo had done drag before, so his good job was less of a surprise than Patrick's.  (And no, John Leguizamo was and is NOT a macho action-movie hero!

After that, one can pick this film apart piece by piece. But here are a few of the film's major problems 1) Drag queens do not dress in drag 24/7. And certainly they do not sleep in drag. Drag is a costume, something worn as part of a show, an alternate identity. In fact the film would have been more interesting if we had got to know the characters in their everyday life as a contrast to their drag identities. But placing the guys in drag and keeping them there keeps them safely in the realm of a sight gag. The characters are not people, they are extented jokes. 2) This is a film about how gay men make the world nice for heterosexual lovers. This would have been truly ground-breaking if it had been about the romantic lives of this trio, not just portraying them, literally, as fairy godmothers who come to work romantic magic for straights. 3) The film is sexist. The trio come to this small town and teach men how to show respect by beating them up and solve all the women's problems by giving them self-esteem inducing makeovers. Men are villains and get violence; women are victims and get pampering. And, of course, gays earn the right to be fabulous. Wouldn't it be interesting if someone made a film where women are taught to respect men and men were pampered their way to self-esteem? That'll never happen. Sadly, Wong Foo truly thinks it is being bold and original, but every step of the way it falls back on clich√©s and tiresome stereotypes.
