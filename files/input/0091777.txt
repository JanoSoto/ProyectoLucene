Yes the series gets worse with each film, but any of the first 4 are better than any American Pie, or any teen comedy ever. The characters have already been established, with the main additions being Bobcat Goldthwaite as Zed, who is endlessly funny, and Mauser as the rival Cmndt. Plot? There are two Police Academies; one must close so a series of competitions are set up to see which is better. Mauser recruits Copeland and Banks from Lassard's school as traitors, but Mahoney and crew eventually prove the better. But these movies are not about plot. Some would say they're not about comedy, or anything else, but as a kid, nothing made me laugh more than these films. And they still do. Jones makes loads of noises, Tackleberry watches his in laws punch each other, Mahoney makes his usual comments, but Zed and Procter are my favourites here. The Blue Oyster Bar is back, and other scenes that keep me laughing are the arrival of Sweetchuck to the Academy, crashing into the car, and Zed singing to make a door fall. I see why people find these completely irritating, but I'm pis*ing myself thinking about them. While I was reading some of the (mostly negative) reviews of this, where people were slagging off the parts they didn't find funny, I was in stitches. May say something about me-but that's something I'm not ashamed of.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Revenge of the 80's Multiple sequels.","Date":"9 January 2005","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Police Academy 3 (1986) The inmates are now running the asylum. Mahony and company are now instructors at the place they once attend. Running out of ideas and funny situations, the film starts to repeat (ad naseum) many of the gags and punchlines from the first two films. While new characters are being added to the series, a few old one decide to leave (for good). If you notice, the bigger the star Steve Guttenberg becomes, the lesser screen time he gets. Oh well.Slightly recommended. If the producers have thought with their heads instead of their pocket books, they should have put this series to bed instead of dragging it out and running the series until the wheels and the engine fell off.

I enjoyed the first two films, and I will say this one had some laughs, but way to much wrong with it to be considered even an okay film. The only redeeming factor is that once again G.W. Bailey is absent and the more funnier Mauser is in this one with his assistant Proctor. They made for most of the humor and Mauser's absence in the next film stands out to me. The story has two police academies in an area and one of them is to be shut down. Mauser is in charge of one, and granted how did he get an academy since the last movie is a rather good question. One wonders is this supposed to be a sequel and for the most part other than this strange turn it seems to be. Most of the jokes have been done, Bobcat is back and you wonder why. He was good in the last movie, in this one his presence is overkill. I thought how Mahoney in the first film got into the academy there is no way Bobcat could have. So all in all the start of very weak sequels and you will begin to know the jokes by heart.

The state decides that it cannot finance two academy's so a competition is declared between Eric Lassard's academy and Commandant Mauser's academy.All the favourites such as Mahoney, Jones, Hooks, Hightower and Tackleberry are back to help train the new recruits which include Zed (the punk from the second film)and Sweetchuck (the little wimp from the second film). We also see the return of the sneaky Kyle Blanks and Chad Copeland. Copeland and Blanks are in cahoots with Commandant Mauser who wishes to discredit Lassard's academy.As usual, there are some great scenes. My favourite scenes were the sneaky Sergeant Proctor ending up nude on the streets, Mauser losing his eyebrows and the ending where the new recruits chase the bad guys on speedboats.All in all, Police Academy 3 is a damn good film.

Once again, for a fan I think this film still has enough laughs be be mildly entertaining but there's no doubt this is where the series started to slip away. While there aren't as many laughs here as the previous two films the thing manages to stay alive due to the nice characters created by the cast. Guttenberg, Smith, Graf, Winslow and Leslie Easterbrook are back with Bob Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinsky returning from the second film. The movie tries to have a plot with the academy threatened to be shut down but of course this just sets up all the attempted laughs. The best moments of the movie happen as we get a semi-remake of the original film as we see the new recruits going through their training. This film only runs 83-minutes, which certainly wasn't the normal thing in 1986 so that should tell you that the screenplay doesn't go for too much.

His scenes breathe a lot of life into this affair, as he screams at doors until they fall down, terrorizes his fellow cadets, hot wires police cars with his teeth and sings at the most inopportune times.

I do so love these characters and they are in top form as the goofball graduates from the first Academy come back to save their alma mater.It seems that budget constraints have forced Governor Ed Nelson to close one of the two Police Academies. The first one is run by clueless Commandant Lassard as played by George Gaynes. The second is a discipline factory run by the nemesis of the graduates from the second Police Academy movie, Sergeant Mauser, played with relish by Art Metrano now a commandant of that Academy.So a contest is to be held to see which one stays open and our regulars, Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, Marion Ramsey, David Graf, and Leslie Esterbrook go back to help the captain they made life hell for as cadets.When you think about it, are the Police Academy movies any different than the classic Keystone Kops? A lot of the same gags are used and a lot more of them that could never have been got away with back in those days. But the idea is the same, an irreverence for law enforcement in the funniest way.These are not films to write elegant tomes about, they are films to laugh whatever part of your anatomy off you want.

Yes, it's lame. Yes, there are one or two real laughs. Yes, it would be more bearable if G. W. Bailey were in it. Yes, it ends in an irrelevant chase sequence. Yes, there is crude racial humour. And yes, the Blue Oyster makes another ill-judged appearance. It's 'Police Academy 3', and it is what it is.As always (a phrase it's easy to overuse when talking about these films) the one-note characters run through their increasingly tiresome shtick gun nut, squeaky voice, big jugs, funny noises. To be fair to Michael Winslow, his mimicry is impressive but, like most other aspects of the movie, ultimately pointless. The appealing actors from 'Police Academy 2' &#x96; Bobcat Goldthwait, Tim Kazurinsky and Lance Kinsey &#x96; again rescue a few scenes from the surrounding comedy void but their efforts are largely in vain. I will admit to cacking myself when Kazurinsky's scooter crashes into the side of a car; if only every gag was as well- timed! And the line 'Mahoney must think he's as dumb as we are!' made me laugh. But of course the script is a modular collection of skits, most of which develop in painfully predictable ways and abruptly end before they can reach a proper conclusion. David Graf shoots a cigar with a crossbow bolt because the smoker won't extinguish it, which is exactly what we'd expect him to do. So what's funny about it? Inept direction kills scenes like Kazurinsky holding up a line of traffic and Winslow pretending to drive a stationary car, because we can see what's going on behind them before the movie cuts to what should be the punchline. One scene takes great pains to set up Gaynes knocking his goldfish bowl out of a window. He does so. Steve Guttenberg catches it. THAT'S THE JOKE. What... why... I mean, what's the point? Of any of it?

I was just reading through some of the message boards about the movies on the IMDb about what peoples' favorite scenes were from part 3 and from the series as a whole, and not one of the scenes mentioned was genuinely funny to me anymore. I remember when I was a kid I loved the movies unconditionally and used to drive my brother insane because I always wanted to watch them, but I can't really remember if I just found the movies fun or if I actually got some good belly laughs out of them. Regardless, the vast majority of the comedy has not dated well, but they are still an amusing romp through the hilarious clothing and comedy styles of the 80s!This time around, Commandant Lassard finds himself in a bit of a moment of crisis as the governor decides that it is no longer financially reasonable to maintain two police academies (the other one headed by the beloved Lieutenant Mauser from part 2), and so one of them will have to be closed. Which academy will be closed depends on performances during a period of observation by an evaluation team. Needless to say, Mauser employs the help of the hilariously idiotic Proctor and the same two goon cadets, Copeland and Blanks, who have been employed by both Mauser and Harris to create problems for our cast of heroes since the first movie. In order to save Lassard's academy, and their own beloved alma mater, from being closed, all of our favorite Police Academy cast members have been brought back from Their First Assignment to become instructors at the academy and ensure that the place looks good.So there you have the setup and the basic plot, and other than that it's essentially exactly the same movie as the first two. The characters are the same, the music's the same, the good guys and bad guys are the same, just the skits are different and this time we have the addition of a few negligible characters, the token geek (Sweetchuck), the token Japanese guy (who really serves no other purpose than to grin like an imbecile and become mesmerized by Callahan's prodigious bosoms), and also the ridiculous additions to the force of Fackler's nutty wife and Tackleberry's nutty brother-in-law. You know, the guy who is always trading punches with his own father. Can you imagine putting a police uniform on such a man? Only in a Police Academy movie!There is not really anything of special note that happens during the movie, although it is a little revealing that this is arguably the funniest installment in the entire series. In keeping with the two preceding movies, we are introduced to the characters in the same way, by glimpsing them in their current lives before the needs of a new movie call them back to the Police Academy world. Hightower is dressing up as an old woman in order to catch purse snatchers in the park, Tackleberry is playing safari in the backyard with his brother-in-law, Fackler is trying to prevent his wife from joining the force (in a scene eerily reminiscent of his first scene in the original movie), and Mahoney is a&#x85;women's basketball coach?Whatever, it doesn't matter what they're doing, their current occupations or pastimes or whatever are just little jokes as they're introduced into the movie. Unfortunately, it's hard to imagine a time when Mahoney's constant flirtations were not as purely creepy as they are now. And that mischievous grin he gets when he's about to play a trick on someone. I need a lot of beers before that's funny, although I would be lying if I said the Police Academies aren't a lot of fun after the beer count enters the double digits. Unfortunately, there is also a definite feeling that in this installment the movie has turned into even more of a series of goofy jokes. Of course, the whole series is a bunch of goofy jokes, but I think that the second sequel is the first time when the characters that we know are used to throw in some moronic sight gags in order to get a cheap laugh, like when Tackleberry pulls out his gun and shoots a payphone because the operator refuses to relinquish her quarter, or Proctor getting locked out in the hallway ass-naked by a prostitute. On the other hand, my beer count was getting up there by this point, so I found both scenes to be pretty funny.It is important to realize that director Jerry Paris developed most of his directing experience on television comedy series, which may have something to do with the, ah, conspicuous lack of subtlety in a lot of the sight gags in Police Academy 2 and 3. It's interesting to consider the impact that his personal directing experience before coming into the Police Academy series may have shaped the series as a whole, which moved in that direction and then never managed to get away from it. Ad now it seems that Steve Guttenberg is attempting to put a Police Academy 8 in motion, in which case I can only hope that he doesn't try to reinvent the series, although I have a feeling that it would take nothing less than a total reinvention to make yet another sequel worthwhile&#x85; "},{"Title":"The mind is mightier than the bosom.","Date":"19 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Okay, so these films were never the most respected of the 1980s, but they at least started off with a nicely foul-mouthed, sexist-pig approach.

This whole series is based on stupidity, funny, small minded, unintelligent fun. To squeeze two story lines out of that was plausible but three...and eventually a WHOPPING SEVEN seems unforgivable. However I will say that the plots are there and perhaps as a slapstick, silly comedy TV Series (ie The Cartoon series) Police Academy may have won people over. Number three in the series tries to really go back to the roots that made the original charming but it's too late to try that. We've been there, we've done that and although moments of it are reminiscent of that silly stupidity, it's definitely lacking and part of the character charm of the original and even the second cast is lost with a mish mash of so many characters, it's too much to follow.Lead actor Steve Guttenberg sadly returns to the dying series as Sgt. Carey Mahoney. All his laughs, and pranks, and witty sarcasm is left behind and Mahoney is barely used as anything more than just a figure head. The rest of the original cast, and a lot of the characters from the second film return as well and they are all so severely downplayed that each character loses his charm. Even the insane Eugene Tackleberry who still has some great scenes (played by David Graf) is way underplayed and the unexplained absence of his true love who was played by Colleen Camp in the second film was unfortunate. Then they added some new characters and brought over some of the second film characters including the incredibly annoying Bobcat Goldthwait as Zed. This guy is not funny in any capacity and he made an alright villain but the idea of bringing him on as a regular cast member was not a good decision and the attempt at making him an odd couple partner to Sweetchuck was a disaster and didn't work. However the character Sweetchuck was the one redeemable new character as he had a slapstick, funny physical character who was annoyingly cute at times.I won't say there is NOTHING redeemable about Police Academy 3. It was good to see the zany Cmndt. Eric Lassard played by George Gaynes back as more of a full time character. Also it was good that the film was set back at the Academy and the roles of Cmndt. Mauser, and Capt. Proctor (from Police Academy 2) were still fun to watch screw up and see the cadets get the better of them. Also the last fifteen minutes of the film are actually some of the better scenes in the entire series featuring an intense almost action packed chase scene on Jetskis. If you saw the first two, you might as well do as I did and check out this third installment but otherwise it probably won't please you much. They're losing steam with poor writing and bad decisions and I think there is some hope here and even some promise but overall...it's a flop!!

The first police academy is headed by Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) while the other is run by the villain in the previous movie, Commandant Mauser (Art Metrano). Being the good guy that he is, Commandant Lassard has every intention of playing by the rules and in that regard he hires some of his best former cadets to hopefully save his academy from the chopping block. Unfortunately, Commandant Mauser is perfectly willing to do whatever it takes to win and for that reason he has two of his own men infiltrate the other academy in order make it look bad. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film fails to distinguish itself from the previous two movies in large part due to the fact that it rehashes the same worn-out gags without hardly any variance at all. A joke gets old after the first time or two. Add in a very lengthy and boring chase scene at the end and even the presence of Bobcat Goldthwait (as Zed) couldn't save this movie. Below average.

Yep once again the best of the boys in blue are called back to campus to help out Lassard. Pretty much all the cast are back again (impressive) as this time Lassard and his favourites must battle Mauser and his own recruits.Confused? well I don't blame ya, it appears that from out of nowhere there are now two police academies in this fictional city. One we all know of and the other run by Mauser, despite the fact this was never mentioned in the previous two films by anyone including Mauser. So both academies are pitched against each other as the city can't afford to run both and one must go. Not too sure why Mauser's cadets are dressed in military type uniforms though, surely they'd all be the same.This equals the same spiel as we got in the first film, and when I say the same I mean the same. Almost all the new recruit sequences from the first film are reenacted yet again in this films beginning. Now you may think this sounds like poor writing but its actually quite neat. For example in the first film we saw Fackler's wife trying to stop him from going to the academy, in this film the sequence is reversed and we see Fackler trying to stop his wife. We also get a role reversal for Goldthwait as Zed the gang leader from the second film plus Sweetchuck is back for them to continue their little comedy duo. We even see the return of Tackleberry's girlfriends wacky family, gotta give it to the continuity in these films.The film does admittedly consist of the same kind of thing we saw in the first film really, the recruits going through the same training that we've seen before like martial arts with Jones, high speed driving, voice commands etc...all on the same location as the first film too! so there's a lot of deja vu. Again like previous films there are pratfalls and gags, this time the main one being Mauser losing his eyebrows and having to wear women's makeup for the rest of the film. Again I can't deny its quite funny and made all the more funny by the brilliant Art Metrano once again.Metrano is brilliant again and Kinsey plays off him well as Proctor, these two are still one of the best things in the franchise for this film and the second.These films are extremely formulaic, identikit films really (hey it seemed to work), all the usual buffoonery eventually leads to the big showdown sequence in the finale where the new recruits prove themselves against the odds. This time its a water based chase sequence with jet ski's, motorboats and absolutely loads of people falling into the water.

The academy must compete with another led by Captain Mauser (Metrano) in order to succeed. Soon, a committee ranks both academies and Mauser tries to sabotage Lassard's academy. Unexpectingly, a group of thieves take a Governor (Ed Nelson) hostage and Lassard's team attempts to rescue him. Kinsey returns as Mauser's assistant, Proctor, Kazurinsky as Sweetchuck, Goldthwait as ex-gang leader, Zed and Tochi plays Nogata, a new recruit who falls for Callahan.

Callahan is back from who knows where, and of course Zed and Sweetchuck were so popular, they are in this as recruits (even though Zed should be in prison).Of course the latter two recruits have the biggest laughs throughout the film.

Some really great and unique actors from the second movie, as the rebellious punk Zed and the shy and rather conservative Sweetchuck, come back and play the new cadets of the police academy to save the honour and future of it because one out of two police academies must close its doors do to too elevated costs. It's a brilliant idea that the charismatic villain Mauser from the second movie is also back in here and the chef of the second police academy that confronts Lessard's academy. Of course, Mahoney, Tackleberry, Hightower and all the other are also starring in this very funny and entertaining flick, this time as instructors instead of cadets as in the first movie. It's very funny to see all those weird and unique characters in those reversed roles.As you might have noticed, this movie still has a high amount of great ideas, funny scenes and entertaining passages that puts the third part on the same level as the first two movies. The reason why this part got one point less from me is the ending. The motorboat chase scenes are simply too long and ultimately quite boring and I think that a real ending is missing as the movie ends somewhat quite suddenly after the chasing scenes. The should have cut off three minutes of the chasing scenes and added them at the end of the movie in my opinion. The movie ends as if the producers have been in a hurry or lack of imagination.But this only negative point doesn't change a thing that this flick is perfectly entertaining and should please to anyone that has seen the first two parts.

Director Jerry Paris does a reasonable enough job of maintaining a steady pace and a lightweight good-natured tone throughout, but alas Gene Quintiano's tired script recycles too many gags from the previous two pictures and offers precious little as far as novel jokes are concerned.

"},{"Title":"The title is a giveaway...","Date":"25 August 2004","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The Police Academy concept always worked best when the action was set in the titular environment, ie when a new bunch of misfits are being trained. Which is ironic, because of the seven (with an eighth apparently on the way) films, only this and the original stick to the formula. While stagnation is never a good thing, a franchise like Police Academy should be encouraged at every turn to do what works best.The title also sums up the entire plot, although a little effort also goes into the setup. Essentially, there have been two police academies in this town for a while now, and the city's administration has decided that it cannot afford to keep both open. The decision as to which will be closed at the end of the current graduating class is to be made on the basis of which class performs better in the eyes of an evaluation committee. The winner is never established in a manner that would put it beyond a shadow of doubt, at least to a completely cynical viewer, but the whole film is about the journey, not the result.A major plot hole exists in the shape of the two types of recruit the academies display. The Mauser academy looks more like a front for the Aryan Union or the like, and the Lassard academy remains a haven for the usual mob of misfits, only this time without any stoolies among the recruits. Correct me if I am wrong, but if the mayor has decided that none of the usual discriminatory factors used to screen the intake of each police academy no longer apply, shouldn't that decision apply to both academies? Or indeed every academy that the city (or state) has?That aside, this was the last film Art Metrano appeared in before an accident left him unable to walk. Like Street Fighter did for Raul Julia, this is the kind of memorial you wouldn't wish upon any actor's career, regardless of their output. Not that he is particularly noticed in this episode. While Harris isn't present to make him redundant, the overcrowding of the cast doesn't leave him with a lot of things to do. He is unmemorable enough that nobody really noticed his absence from future PA films, or films of any kind for that matter.A more skilled actor such as George Gaynes, for example, is able to use the minimal screen time he gets in order to make his character memorable. As the near-senile commandant who is supposed to be the focus of sympathy, he makes his mark well. Why he's never been in anything more substantial in the past twenty years, I will never know. For the rest of the cast, hitting the one note they are capable of is perfectly sufficient, and considering the proliferation of so-called a-list stars who cannot even achieve that much these days, I think some cast members deserve more credit than they get.This is truly Bobcat Goldthwait's film. As the latest recruit at the Lassard academy, he goes into a literal overdrive of screaming and nervous tics. It is an odd testament to the man's talent that he can literally make this work as a comedy act. What made Mahoney so loveable and funny in the first film, Zed exploits to greater heights. When Steve Guttenberg refused to come back for episode five, they should have offered Bobcat the sky to take his place. The results of them not doing so are now a matter of historical record.I gave Police Academy 3 a one out of ten. On a purely intellectual level, it is less than zero, but in terms of pure fun, it scores a few points. Those who have to follow a series should be advised that this is the last of the PA films that this could be said of.

They will be four more times. And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it whatsoever.Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) is back with his band of dim-witted officers of the law in this second (*gulp*) sequel in the Police Academy series. This time the half-baked, half-mixed plot involves Commandant Lassard's (George Gaynes) Police Academy being threatended to shut down when the city announces one of its academies must close due to funding. A competing academy schemes deviously in childish ways to get Commander Lassard's new cadets to screw up and therefore make Lassard's academy look bad (resulting in the city closing it down) -- and so Carey Mahoney and co. are brought in to restore peace and point out the bad guys for who they are -- typical, immature bad guys in a very, very cliched script!Police Academy 3 is the starting point of a very ill-fated series; a series whose downfall began with the very first (and which should have been last) entry, and is now starting to become something so disgustingly hideous and vile that it makes you want to close your eyes and whine. Okay, I'll admit it, as horrible as the first two were, they were passable in a strange sort of way. (It's amazing, the kind of thing that will entertain you at 330 in the morning.) But Police Academy 3 is just awful -- the type of so-called comedy that isn't as much a comedy as it is a gigantic sore. I watched it on a truly lazy Sunday afternoon -- which may be why, in my original, older IMDb review, I said it was the type of comedy for people too lazy to mow their lawns on Sundays (something I usually do but had put aside on this particular day for...this...)Surprisingly, the film was directed by Jerry Paris, the man who helmed Part II in the neverending series. He is both an accredited actor and director, appearing in The Untouchables (the TV show, that is), The Dick Van Dyke Show, and directing some classic television programs, including The Odd Couple and Happy Days. Guessing from the outcome of the two films, you'd never guess that he has any background whatsoever.Why Warner Bros. thought shoving him towards the general direction of the director's chair was a good idea is beyond me, but the man obviously suffers from a rare disorder among men named Ican'tdirectavitis (a noun meaning incapable of directing even if the fate of mankind depended on it). Jerry Paris obviously favors dumb sight gags over intelligent humor. He would be great for some kind of Three Stooges remake that I hear the Farrelly Brothers are getting into -- but physical comedy also needs timing just as much as humor of the more psychological kind, something the Farrelly Brothers are good at. (Comedic timing is their perfection.)But poor Jerry Paris couldn't always have been that bad, what with all those television shows behind him. He's Vintage Hollywood. Note the Vintage part. The man simply lost his touch in the later years, which is quite evident through this putrid material. Jerry Paris passed away in 1986, the year Police Academy 3 Back in Training was released into theaters nationwide. With all respect to the man, maybe the fact that he was on his deathbed during the filming of the movie had something to do with its amateuristic style and incompetent humor.Steve Guttenberg remains unfunny for reasons I pointed out in my recent review of the original chapter in this neverending saga. The movies themselves remain disgraceful for noted reasons, as well. But Bobcat Goldthwait and David Graf remain the only two capable comedians in this film -- and their talents are wasted. I enjoyed the character of Tackleberry (Graf) in the first and second film, and Zed (Goldthwait) in the second. They saved what little was left of the series. But not here -- even they cannot lift this film from becoming a boggled mess of unfunny sight gags, flatulence gags, sound gags, and more sight gags.There's nothing more shameful than sequels being shipped out one-a-year in an effort to contribute to a pointless, loathed film series -- it's the most evident sign of a cash-in-franchise ever conceived by the scandalous thieves in Tinseltown. Did they expect the remaining small numbers of fans to turn up for...this? Steve Guttenberg, the man with no shame and sense of morality, even turned down the fifth film in this series. The sad thing? Nobody ever said anything about missing him.The tagline for Police Academy 3 Back in Training is Run for Cover!

Mauser continues his villainous but funny character and Proctor continues to be the slapstick and bumbling assistant to Mauser. The addition of Cadets Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait), Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky) and Cadet Nogata (Brian Tochi) added more humor and charm to the story.This movie goes at a more quicker pace than the previous two films and the plot seems to be more intact and intriguing, from the sergeants training the cadets to all the running gags at Mauser's and Proctor's expense.

To new recruits and old enemies.","Date":"25 October 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" While it's by no means unwatchable, the third movie in the Police Academy franchise was the one when you could start to sense things getting a bit stale. There are still laughs but they don't come as easily, feeling slightly forced and relying as much on audience goodwill as the quality of the material.There are two police academies in the city, one now somehow being run by Mauser (Art Metrano returning) and the other still being run by Lassard (George Gaynes again), but that's all about to change. An evaluation of each academy is happening and there can be only one winner. Of course, Mauser wants to win and will do anything to ensure this. So begins another round of dirty tricks and pranks as Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) and company return to the academy to train the latest recruits and try to keep the academy operating for future potential police officers.Gene Quintano is responsible for the script this time and basically trots out numerous gags from the previous two movies. The good news is that they work but the bad news is that you can only pretend for so long that it still feels just as much fun on the third go. Marion Ramsey going from timid little mouse to gun-wielding officer screaming don't move, dirtbag, David Graf trying to be Rambo whenever possible, Bubba Smith looming over everyone, Michael Winslow providing his mind-boggling array of sound effects and Leslie Easterbrook impressing people with her forthright bosom - all of these things are fun, as is Guttenberg's cheek, the incompetence of the baddies and Lassard's absent-minded ways, but when there's nothing added to them they can't carry a third movie.There are a few new characters but none that really stand out. Tim Kazurinsky and Bobcat Goldthwait return and continue to be very amusing but David Huband is blander than bland, Shawn Weatherly is just there for Guttenberg's character to flirt with and Brian Tochi is stuck with a stereotypical mid-80s interpretation of a Japanese man (e.g. struggling with the language, always smiling and able to show some martial arts prowess, specifically in one scene that feels like a strange progenitor of the Rush Hour movies).Jerry Paris does okay with the directing duties but the movie feels more like an unsuccessful action comedy than an all-out lowbrow laughfest. Running at just about 80 minutes (with a little musical interlude for some of the cast to perform a song entitled Team Thing), and with a 15 minute action-filled sequence at the climax, it manages not to outstay it's welcome and actually has a fair few decent stunts packed in to the last reel. It's not as good as the two preceding movies but the sequels would get worse.

Basically police funding is being cut, and as a result a Police Academy must be closed. To make it, Govenor Neilson (Ed Nelson) is allowing two academies to compete against each other to see which one will stay in operation. Cmndt. Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) brings back past graduates Sgt. Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Sgt. Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Sgt. Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Sgt.

Mauser (Art Metrano), and also instruct and train many of the new recruits. Besides that, they have to catch a gang of robbers dressed as busboys at the marina. Also starring Tim Kazurinsky as Cadet Sweetchuck and Bob Goldthwait as Cadet Zed (the bad guy from the previous film). Guttenberg is still okay, Winslow does entertain with his variety of self-made sound effects, including some scanner and throat noises, but it's pointless. Poor!

In the film, he was poking fun at badly dubbed Chinese kungfu dialogues and made an extremely high but absolutely pointless jump in front of the bad guys. It was a hilarious jump. His creativity in generating sounds is also impressive. The sound effects genuinely came from his mouth apparently. Unfortunately, this is the last appearance of Mauser (Art Metrano) because he broke his neck in 1986.
