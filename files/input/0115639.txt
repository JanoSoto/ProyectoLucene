[{"Title":"Captures the imagination and heart","Date":"17 April 2001","Score":"79 out of 83 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  It is very rare to encounter a film so devoted to character and this is the greatest strength of Beautiful Girls. Each character has their own personal turmoil and lightness which shines through in a film which from start to finish very little movement of plot is actually achieved, but then again it doesn't need to.Small-town sensibilities and community spirit are intertwined with the notions of enigmatic strangers posing in an almost prophetic manner delivering advice upon the populous. Events such as brutal fighting, unashamed drunkenness and references to sex are handled as items which are not derogatory but necessary in a rites of passage kind of way. Each character develops through the film into better individuals of what they once were but not to such an extent as to impose sickly sweet values on the audience.Every character is natural and rounded despite some major personality flaws. Timothy Hutton's excellent Willy is at odds with himself over the next stage of growing up, Rappaport plays the goofy yet loveable fool for love, Dillon the lost soul and Emmerich the doting yet somewhat incapable father. But it is in the Beautiful Women themselves where the real essence of the film lies. Uma Thurman is every blonde inch the mysterious and elegant Andera crossing paths with everyone and influencing their lives for the better. Rosie O'Donnell as the brash 'matron' of the group is the perfect foil for Sorvino's insecure personality. The ace of the bunch however is a mesmerising Natalie Portman who even despite being the cast's youngest member is compelling to the point that you can understand Willy's fascination with her character Marty.For anyone wishing for comfort on a cold winter afternoon there are very few films with such a strong heart, Demme excels himself by never laying on the sentimentality rather poking gingerly at our own innermost feelings, and coming out with a winner.

There are several ensemble movies out there, but this movie is definitely one of the best ones. The key word in ensemble cast is obviously cast. And this movie has a stellar cast. Timothy Hutton, as Willy, is perfectly cast. Yes, this is an ensemble movie, but it sort of hovers around his character and he carries the movie so well. And to play off him, Natalie Portman is tremendous in this movie. Despite being the youngest cast member, she outacts most of the adults in this movie. Her chemistry with Timothy Hutton is amazing. The other cast members, including Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Rappaport, Uma Thurman, and Matt Dillon are also really good in their respective roles. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a hilarious monologue about the differences between men and women and it should not be missed.The story is relatively simple... a man going back home to attend his 10 year reunion. But because of the complex characters and their various storys, it becomes much more than just a high school reunion. Its a story about a man finding himself. Its a story about a young girl getting a taste of what love might be, despite it being in an unlikely person. Its a story of a man who has to grow up and let go of the long gone high school glory years. Its a story about relationships, between friends, family and couples. All these tales are interwoven into a heartwarming story. This movie ranks as one of my all time favorite movies.

But they are wrong about this movie. This movie is entertaining and sometimes fluffy, but more importantly it is real and timely. Amongst all the hype of the X-Gen, this movie boiled down our mood (all us kids who are still growing up) in a small town setting where the people were real (except for Rosie, she should have ended up on the editing room floor). The slight plot is less important than the setting and the circumstances. Winter in small town Massachusetts, on the frozen lakes, and the plowed roads and small taverns - on the edge of early mid-life adulthood for yet another lost generation...the movie leaves you with a cold warm snow feeling of hope and sorrow for people in transition, that usually only a classic novel (like those by F.

Too bad Demme is Donne because this is great work. Every single role is believable and not over-acted. Maybe it's my 30 something (now 40 something) mind working but this is a great movie to sit down and enjoy. Nothing blows up and I can't recall a single car chase but if you can allow yourself to get involved with a storyline, this is for you.You can fall in love with Natalie Portman and I don't know that I've ever seen Rapaport in a better role. There isn't anyone more anti Rosie Odonell than me, but even her role is great. The bad news for friends and family is that I've stolen many lines from this flick because I'm not original enough to come up with my own stuff.What's he all creased aboutI would be first in line to purchase a (another) DVD that is Dolby Digital and has some extras. Lastly, don't miss the soundtrack, there is a great blend of feel good music along with some new, cool licks.

As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point, `I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be--' and the denial, that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man, and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road, forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating, in `Beautiful Girls,' a drama featuring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.Willie Conway (Hutton) is back home in the Midwest for his high school reunion, but more than that, to try and make some decisions about his future.  He finds that nothing much has changed-- the town, or his old friends, most of whom seem to be exerting more time and energy attempting to cling to what was, rather than moving on with their lives.  Tommy Rowland (Dillon), for instance, the high school `hero,' as it were, now drives a snowplow; for all intents and purposes, his life `peaked' in high school, and he can't seem to get past it.  Then there's Paul (Michael Rapaport), who just doesn't seem to want to grow up; after a seven year relationship with Jan (Martha Plimpton), he refuses to make that final commitment-- after all, `What's the rush?'All of which does nothing to help Willie with his own dilemma; the only words of wisdom he gets from anyone, in fact, come from the precocious thirteen-year-old, Marty (Natalie Portman), who lives next door.  But in a couple of days, Tracy (Annabeth Gish), the girl Willie `thinks' he wants to marry, is due to arrive from Chicago, so it's time to move beyond the crossroads; for Willie, it's decision time.Demme delivers a story that just about everyone in the audience is going to connect with on some level, because everyone's gone through (or will go through) these kinds of things at one time or another.  Who hasn't experienced, if only for a moment, that sense of either wanting to stay as they are or going back to what they were, when life was better, or at least simpler.  Or more fun.  Working from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg, Demme examines the relationships between this eclectic group of individuals in a way that offers some insights into human nature that will no doubt elicit some reflection on the part of the viewer.  It all points up that, no matter what it may look like on the surface, underneath it all we're not so different from one another; we all share that common bond of learning life's lessons one day at a time, albeit in our own particular way, which corresponds to who we are as individuals.  And Demme succeeds in telling his story with warmth and humor; by tapping into the humanity at the heart of it all.The story may focus on Willie, but the film is a true ensemble piece, realized as it is through the sum of it's many and varied parts.  It's a talented cast of actors bringing a unique bunch of characters to life that makes this film what it is, beginning with Hutton, who anchors it with his solid portrayal of Willie, a challenging role in that Willie has to be an average guy who is unique in his own right.  The same can be said of Dillon's Tommy, in whom traces of Dallas Winston from `The Outsiders' can be found; Tommy is, perhaps, just Dallas a few years later.Mira Sorvino gives a memorable performance by creating the most sympathetic character in the film, Tommy's girlfriend, Sharon.  This is the girl who was never going to be prom queen, and who up until now has lacked the self-confidence necessary to create a positive environment for herself.  Lauren Holly, meanwhile, succeeds with her portrayal of Darian Smalls, the absolute opposite of Sharon, a young woman who is probably too positive for her own good and who lives the life of a perpetual prom queen, an individual who-- as another character succinctly puts it-- was `Mean as a snake,' back in the day.  Good performances that add a balanced perspective to the film.There are two performances here that really steal the show, however.  The first being that of Michael Rapaport, who as Paul so completely and convincingly captures the very essence of an average Joe with not too much on the ball, no prospects for the future to speak of, but who is, at heart, a good guy.  There's humor and pathos in his portrayal, which personifies that particular state of being the film is seeking to depict.  Excellent work by Rapaport, and decidedly one of the strengths of the film.The most memorable performance of all, however, is turned in by Natalie Portman, who at fifteen is playing the thirteen-year-old Marty, the girl mature and wise beyond her years (`I'm an old soul,' as she puts it), with whom Willie forms a kind of bond as she, in her own way, helps him to sort out his feelings and find his focus.  Portman's performance here-- some three years before she would forever become Padme Amidala-- exhibits that spark and charismatic screen presence that has served her so well since, in films like `Anywhere But Here,' and `Where the Heart Is.'  She has for some time been, and continues to be, one of the finest and most promising young actors in the business.The cast also includes Noah Emmerich (Mo), Rosie O'Donnell (Gina), Max Perlich (Kev), Uma Thurman (Andrea), Anne Bobby (Sarah) and Pruitt Taylor Vince (Stanley), all of whom help to make `Beautiful Girls' a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.  And that's the magic of the movies.  8/10.

I figured either the tape was run down (with it being ex-rental) or the film was crap and nobody ever rented it.  However, the prospect of Matt Dillion and Timothy Hutton in the same film made me buy it (although my girlfriends were discouraged!)So after a marathon evening of Gladiator followed by Being John Malkovich, I popped this in the Video and was enthralled!  The acting was great and the story relevant to real-life.  Everybody goes through these problems, after all.  The chemistry between Willie (Timothy Hutton) and Marty (the wonderful Natalie Portman) was brilliant - even though the subject is considered taboo.Matt Dillion's little triangle with Mira Sorvino and Lauren Holly is an entertaining sideline and Michael Rapaport provides the comic relief as we watch his crumbling relationship with Martha Plimpton.  Rosie O'Donnell is also hilarious as the down-to-earth ready-to-break-your-balls-if-you-step-out-of-line type who is happy to rip the rose coloured glasses from your face whenever she feels its necessary.There is a real sense of friendship between this all-star cast and that really the defining factor in this film.  However, the real stars are Hutton and Portman who are simply brilliant.  She has perfected the little vixen role in Leon (aka The Professional) and although the characters of Mathilda and Marty are completely different, there is that little inkling of a girl wanting to be loved by a man in her performance.  Hutton handles his role with care - and his Winnie-The-Pooh speech is simply heartbreaking!

Timothy Hutton was absolutely brilliant. Rosie O'Donell, though I despise her at times, has a brilliant feminist scene in which she puts Hutton and Dillon in their place. Uma Thurman, though a fairly limited role in the movie, is a stunning character, and her role ties the movie completely together, bridging the gap between the feminists and the vulgar men in the movie. A young Natalie Portman gets her career off to a great start as a very cute, very sophisticated 13 year old, who's witty charm is the icing on the cake.

I don't know if reading it before will spoil it for you--I doubt it, in fact, but you never know.)Being the typical unmarried man, I rented Beautiful Girls because of its attractive title.  I had no idea it could be so moving or endearing.  I may be just getting soft, but it was one of the few films I have thought about for more than 72 hours after I saw it.Aside from all the sexual content, swearing, etc., the dialogue between Marty (the now beautiful Natalie Portman) and Willie (my favorite actor, Timothy Hutton) is nothing short of astounding.  Willie is enchanted and attracted to this little 13-year old girl next door.  As they exchange more and more conversation, he realizes her great potential and even dreams about how he might just be able to wait ten years and maybe marry her.The scene in which Willie discusses his feelings with Mo, his married friend was the turning point of the story.  Willie realizes that, even if she had a love-at-first-sight crush on him, she would drift away as she matures; she would find someone closer to her own age, and Willie would become just some silly old man she met when she was young and had a ridiculous, immature attraction to.  He realizes that by just being her friend, he will be able to keep her in a much more real way than if he tries to wait for her to be his lover.But the one scene I will remember forever, the most perfect scene in the entire movie, in which the dialogue seemed neither forced nor over-elongated, was the scene in the ice-skating rink with Marty and Willie. Marty tells Willie all the things he would have liked to hear before his talk with Mo.  She would marry him after they waited five years, etc.  The association Willie makes with Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robins is so beautiful it almost made me cry.  (Not really, but you get the point).  He gives her a good taste of reality, and she seems mature enough to understand.In a later scene, Willie tells Marty that he would like to continue being a friend, even a mentor to her, and he has total confidence that whatever she does will be amazing.There are about three other stories intertwined into the movie, but the Portman-Hutton line stands out as the superior.Overall, a wonderful movie to which they should have given a title that would attract people with the ability to be moved.P.S.  The funniest part of the entire movie is the confused look Willie and Paul exchange after Mo gives unusually-phrased threats to Steven, who beat up their friend.

All of the male characters in this film with the possible exception of Moe, are trying to stay cool by refusing to grow up. Willy is wrestling with the idea of becoming a salesman and giving up on his lifelong passion of music. Only if he sticks with his music will he stay cool and according to Tracy stay sexy. He is also trying to avoid growing up by not getting too commited to Tracy. In the film he is willing to stray not once but twice. Moe tells him his infectuation with the 13 year old Marty is purely his way of refusing to grow up (not grow old and here Moe makes the definition between the two) but there is a definite chemistry between the two. Meanwhile his grown-up infactuation with the sublimely sexy Endera is his last attempt at a fling before he grows up and decides he wants to spend the rest of his life with Tracey. Endera talks him out of it and tells him how lucky he is to have Tracy in the same way Endera's boyfriend is lucky to have her.Tommy's way of staying cool is to relive his high-school days and this means his affair with his high-school girlfriend Darian has to go on in order for him to stay cool. But by the end after having it beaten out of him by Darien's husband he realises his bird-man days are at an end and it's time to settle down with Sharon.Meanwhile Paul has to grow up he realises he has to do something with his life or he'll end up like the three old guys at the bar as he says he doesn't want to end up like them. This is why he proposes to Jan and when she refuses he knows he has to do something else. His last words to Willy nothing changes here but the seasons leads us to believe that Paul believes the only way he can truly change is to get out as Willy has done.Meanwhile Kev is quite happy with his life and thinks that he is cool beacuse when Paul has his rant about the three old guys working and then drinking Kev thinks this will be a cool way to grow old.So therefore Beautiful Girls is a film about men refusing to grow up and wanting to stay cool for as long as possible. While the strong female characters in this film try to get them to grow up. This is an inspirational film about the different types of middle-aged men and there on-going rriendship with each other. 9 out of 10 "}{"Title":"Beautifully crafted coming-of-age, slice-of-life drama","Date":"13 July 2006","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I found this one of those films that just has you saying, yes! yes! yes! throughout.

His career as a musician isn't going anywhere, and he needs to decide what to do with his life. So he returns to the town where he grew up, under the guise of attending his high school reunion, to decide if he is ready to grow up and move on. Should he give up his dreams, marry his lawyer girlfriend, get a regular job, settle in?This is the premise around which Beautiful Girls revolves. Willie is the central character in a group of twenty-something high school buddies who never left adolescence. They are the quintessential poster boys for abstinence of every stripe. They don't get it. Not just relationships. They don't get anything. They hold down dead end jobs, carry on dysfunctional relationships with women who care about them more than they deserve, and spend quality time together every week fishing in an ice house in the middle of a frozen lake. It's enough to make you feel good about your own life. The characters, especially the male ones, don't generate much sympathy. Their wounds are self-inflicted; they have little interest in the world around them. Still, each possesses a certain vulnerability that makes them easy to relate to and we all know people in our lives like them.While his friends go about their lives oblivious to life's possibilities, Willie is looking for something. He is looking for something beautiful. And he finds it in the most unlikely of places &#150; next door, literally. Marty (Natalie Portman in her best role) is pretty, precocious, and confident, with a penchant for quoting classic literature. It's love at first sight, fate having brought them together. Only there's a problem &#150; she's only thirteen. But, as she duly informs him, she is an 'old soul', wise beyond her years. And it is their sweet, confusing, and ultimately transcending relationship that becomes the heart of the movie.Willie is initially cautious, somewhat befuddled and in something of a state of denial about his growing affection for Marty. But pretense soon falls away and he begins to come to terms with his feelings for her. She's smart, she's funny. She's hot...(but) it's not a sexual thing. I could wait. In ten years she'll be 23 and I'll be 39 and it will be no big thing. SPOILER Marty, on the other hand, possesses the clarity of youth and in the movies pivotal scene at the ice rink, she shares her feelings with him Marty You should wait till you're ready. Until you meet someone who excites you.Willie Yeh, well, she may not be out there. Willies girlfriend Tracy doesn't excite him - he is still looking for someone who can. That is why he is balking at marrying her. He knows he would never be happy with someone who doesn't inspire him. Marty Alas, Romeo, we can't do diddly. You go to the penitentiary and I become the laughingstock of the Brownies. But if your feelings for me are true, you'll wait.Willie Wait?Marty Yep. Wait five years. I'll be eighteen. We can walk through this world together.The look on Marty's face is priceless, it says it all - she's in love and she knows he has feelings for her. She wants him to know what she feels for him is real and unique and she wants him to wait for her while she grows up and he sorts his life out.Willie I can't be a Pooh. Willie is afraid, afraid that if he waits for her, she won't be there when he is ready. But she just smiles, a smile that reflects her confidence, her unshakable belief in the power of fate. Meanwhile, Willies relationship with Tracy is going nowhere. He knows Tracy is a wonderful girl - smart and sweet. But he is not in love with her. His father is in love with her. His younger brother is in love with her. But he isn't. He never says he loves her at any time, not once. He kisses her briefly once or twice, but there is no passion, no excitement shared between them. There is affection. There is respect. There is friendship. But there is no love, nor the special connection necessary for love to develop. The only time he gets close to her is when they have sex in his room. But sex is not intimacy. Sex is not love. True intimacy defies words. It is transcendental. And that is the beauty that Willie seeks.The final scene provides subtle hints as to what the future holds. Even as he is packing Tracys things into the trunk of the car as they prepare to leave, he keeps glancing over his shoulder next door hoping to see Marty. When she does appear she doesn't say Goodbye, she says Later, Pooh. She knows they will see each other again and that he is indeed her Pooh. But his Pooh is not one that her Christopher Robin is willing to forget. Their future is reflected in the remarkable series of emotions that cross Marty's face as she watches him leave. First there is sadness, then contemplation, and finally determination. It is not a look of farewell, it is a see-you-in-five-years look. And when she waves goodbye, it is not with sadness, but with anticipation, resolve, of faith in destiny. She is telling him, 'I'll be here.END SPOILER This is a sweet, endearing story of love in its purest form - timeless, selfless, eternally optimistic .

In addition to the aforementioned Academy Award winners/nominees, the cast includes Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton, Academy Award nominee Matt Dillon, Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino and Emmy Award winners/nominees Annabeth Gish, Rosie O'Donnell and Martha Plimpton.The story isn't much. Piano player Timothy Hutton comes home to a small town in Massachussetts and bonds with his old drinking buddies. Hutton feels stuck in a rut and cannot decide whether or not to quit his present gig and become a salesman. Although this is unspoken, I'm sure he feels inadequate and not worthy of his girlfriend, Annabeth Gish, who is a lawyer. His drinking buddies have problems of their own. Buddy Matt Dillon is having an affair with a married woman (Lauren Holly). Another buddy finds himself on the outs with his long time girlfriend because he is afraid to commit. Worst, Hutton finds himself infatuated with 13 going on 30 Natalie Portman (utterly convincing, charming, willful and wise). Uma Thurman plays the bartender's sister, in briefly from Chicago. Although Thurman's role is brief, she steals every scene she's in, as, Andrea, the beautiful, brilliant, but very together outsider.WARNING SPOILER One of the most satisfying things about Beautiful Girls is how Marty (Natalie Portman) handles Hutton leaving with Annabeth Gish. See you later, Portman says, knowingly, absolutely certain she will eventually overcome the age barrier and wind up with Hutton. You know she will, as this is a very wise, determined young woman. I've met several in my life and it's fascinating to watch how they handle the world adjusting to them, rather the other way around. Jack Benny's future wife was twelve when he met her and President Grover Cleveland met his wife-to-be when she was three weeks old and he was 26. So, it does happen. You really believe Hutton when he tells Portman he wants to keep in touch; because, when she grows up, she'll be ...absolutely amazing. Marty already is. She's certainly wiser and more focused than almost any of the adults in this film (except Thurman).END OF SPOILER Sit back and enjoy this beautifully written, expertly acted, laid back movie.

To this end, Beautiful Girls is a veritable guy flick and addresses to a more emotional end, some of the same 20-something angst and existentialist related issues faced by men as seen in more obvious (and violent) examples such as Fight Club. This film is a richly textured character story, profiling one man's quest for self understanding and direction by returning to his banal hometown from the big city while at a crossroad in his personal life, and while entering a new epoch in his relationship with an equally banal woman. His amalgam of high school friends remain isolated, almost indentured, to the same working class routine which defined their adolescence, and have little hope of ever moving on, other than in their idle daydreams. His subsequent obsession with the barely pubescent girl next door, Marty,(Portman) is in fact somewhat reminiscent of the dialectic of beauty and decay explored in Thomas Mann's epic Death in Venice whereas her youth and perceived way of interpreting the world is enviable, almost infectious. She represents less of a sexual or romantic fixture in his mind than she does a crucible for all things he values and hopes for. And still hopes to be. This film is not for everybody, and some less patient, or intelligent, viewers will no doubt decry it as boring or slow. Indeed the storyline is far from cutting edge, but the real story in this film is the people, the place, and the raw emotion which we can all relate with. This film is an impressionist painting come to life and is perfect philosophical fodder for the introspective type.

O'Donnell and Rapaport stand out for their wonderful comedic performances, and Dillon and Thurman are terrific as usual.  But this movie is definitely best when Hutton and Portman are talking to one another.  As much as I enjoyed the movie in general, I was always anxious for the next Hutton-Portman scene to take place.  Throw in an excellent musical soundtrack, and you've got yourself some top-notch entertainment.  I will admit that the occasional line did seem a little too far-fetched to be believable, but that is my only quibble with this gem.  It's a must-see.

But I was positively *cringing* at some scenes, especially the sing-song bit in the bar, where everyone joined in as if it had been a tradition of theirs for years, with everyone knowing the words and everyone loving it oh so much; an awful piece of directing and acting (Mo going off key so obviously). This film was full of stupid things that no one would do or say and things that weren't said that would have been, etc.  What woman wouldn't take offence if a friend told her she reminded her of Kathy Bates from Misery?  Check out the dialogue of Willie's father following the dinner with Tracey. In places this film is unbearable. If I hadn't been waiting for the appearance of Annabeth Gish I might have turned off in disgust long before the end.  But there are a few redeeming features; Michael Rapaport as Paul giving his reasons for not removing his pictures of models from his wall becomes almost poetic (we'll ignore the fact that this was totally out of character).  He was carrying more than his fair share of this movie single-handedly, with Matt Dillon and Rosie O'Donnell sleepwalking through familiar territory, and the other supporting roles so numerous that they could only be thinly written.  But this is undoubtedly Natalie Portman's film.  She is a triumph, even if her character does stretch credibility to breaking point.  The doomed romance is played so perfectly I fell for her myself, and the penultimate exchange between her character Marty, and Willie, moved me to tears. Although Portman's performance is so good I would go so far as to say one should watch it just for that, this isn't great filmmaking. A final sour note is that Beautiful Girls also has a distinctly unsavory, female-chauvanistic tone. SummaryHas redeeming features but not enough.

In somewhat similar vein to Barry Levinson's classic, Diner. It's the 60s there and the 90s here but the issues are the same becoming an adult, commitment, responsibility, finding one's true love and so on. The reason why the movie works is that the characters are well-written and the actors depict them spot on. All of the cast does an excellent job but special credit must be given to young Natalie Portman whose talent just shines through in this film. And of course, the man who created the environment for the actors to excel and the wonderful atmosphere of the film is the director, Ted Demme (RIP).

I saw it for the first time yesterday - it's free through my on-demand digital cable. So I watched most of it again tonight, fast forwarding through the scenes I didn't want to see. I had heard about it years ago, and remembered thinking it might be entertaining. It's a mixed bag - not without its flaws, and some clichéd characters, but entertaining and an interesting story overall. What I love most are all the scenes between the 28-year-old male central character (Timothy Hutton) and 13-year-old girl (Natalie Portman)infatuated with each other. Don't be alarmed. It's strictly platonic,but the filming, acting, dialogue, even staging/choreography (what is it called for films?) associated with those scenes is just poetic. And sweetly sad. The story is fairly standard - a young man (Timothy Hutton playing Willie) returns to his small hometown for some soul searching/guidance about his direction in life, as well as his 10-year high school reunion He has been living in New York City as a struggling pianist, and is at a crossroads with his girlfriend of 11 months, lawyer Tracy (played by Annabeth Gish). He reunites and hangs out with his old buddies, played raucously by Matt Dillon, Noah Emmerich, Michael Rapaport and Max Perlich. There is the standard hanging out and drinking, and more drinking. The loves and tribulations of his buddies propel much of the plot forward. However, the crux of the film is Willie's conflicts about how to proceed forward (should he marry Tracy? is she really the One? should he quit trying to make it as a pianist, and just take a sales job?). And this crisis is sort of given form (in my opinion) in this interaction which blossoms into something more between Willie and Marty (Portman's character). I became an instant fan of Timothy Hutton after watching this film. He actually shares excellent chemistry with Natalie Portman. A bit weird, because I think they were actually around 36 and 15 respectively when this film came out. What's funny is that usually in films, the young kid has the inappropriate crush on the adult, which then resolves itself magically somehow. Or it's just a case of straight-up pedophelia (sp?). In this case, he seems to fall first for her precocious wit and cutting, insightful banter, and is obviously disturbed by it. She also is attracted to him - as she tells him, she has an old soul. And when she in fact declares her feelings to him in her vivacious charming way. Timothy Hutton's laugh and expression are priceless - a perfect mixture of amusement, guilt, embarrassment, surprise and of course, longing/fascination. I absolutely loved his illustration of the impossibility of their situation with the Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin story (the ending of which I didn't know until I saw this film). I also liked how the actors always maintained an awkward air and careful distance in the scenes. It added a great deal of impact.I think this love story is probably the purest sort of love I've ever seen in a Hollywood film - his attraction didn't begin on the physical level, and hers was just as pure, coming from a 13-year-old, although she was not your average 13 year old. Natalie Portman played the role perfectly. This attraction remain unrealized, and was thus preserved. A bit sad. But very watchable. Highly recommended for those scenes, if you like that sort of poignancy. The acting all around is top rate in this film, but Timothy Hutton seems to inhabit his character completely. He portrays specific mannerisms, expressions and actions which perfectly convey his characters exasperation, with a subtle angst. He usually has this slight amused smile, which seems to be Willie's little foible. I have watched this film numerous times, and usually stare at Timothy Hutton whenever he's on screen, even when he's not the center of action or dialogue. It actually made me a little envious that I'm too old to try and become an actor. He was very inspiring. "},{"Title":"In a word?

Hardly surprising! Getting together really good actors like Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, Natalie Portman, Timothy Hutton and Mira Sorvino all in the same film, as well as a worthy bunch in the supporting cast, is almost a guarantee in itself. I say `almost' as besides having renowned actors it is essential that the director is also up to the mark. And Ted Demme carries it off rather well in this film.

Over the next 100 minutes he and his buddies entertain us hugely as they try to take, or avoid taking, the next major steps in their various lives.The movie rather simplifies life, the whole goal of which seems to be to find the perfect partner.  Those characters who have found theirs are happy, those who haven't (or those who haven't recognised that they just might have) are troubled, and it is these troubles which dominate virtually every scene and conversation.  By comparison, Willie's indecision over his career in the music business gets glossed over with indecent haste.Helped by a fantastic ensemble cast (for example, the sublime Martha Plimpton (where's she been since Running on Empty?) and David Arquette in tiny roles) and a fun soundtrack, and any number of memorable quotes, this movie will say something to anyone of that age-group.  The scenes between Willie and Marty (Natalie Portman) are especially effective, while Andera's (Uma Thurman) descriptions of moments of perfection in a relationship are right on the nail.Even though all the plot-lines come together with startling predictability, it's the journey there that makes this such an enjoyable film.

It works very effectively.The plot is of a pianist (Willie) returning to his home town in the burbs when he reaches a turning point in his life.  Nothing has changed.  His friends are the same eccentric goofs that they were in high school, with no direction whatsoever.  Mostly they're still bachelors chasing girls who they deem to be worthy.  One of the points of the film is guy's occasional obsession with screen sirens and such, that blinds them to the wonderful women right in front of them.  Of the guys, only one, Moe, is married.  He is viewed either as a role model, or in the words of the obsessive Paul, Like a retarded guy.  He doesn't know what he's missing out on, so he's content despite his handicap.Willie has to decide whether he should marry his long-time girlfriend, and has come back to his roots to seek answers.  His friends lend moral support, but due to their social immaturity, the choice remains entirely up to him. One of the fascinating characters is played by Natalie Portman, a 13 year old girl with 'an old soul' who Willie is fascinated by.  Now now, don't panic...  They're soul mates, not lovers.A fascinating and truthful film with very believable characters. All the characters are flawed and thus more believable.  Willie procrastinates about marriage even though it's obvious he cares for his girlfriend; the ideal of marriage freaks him out, even though he's not a womaniser.  He wants to keep things fresh on a daily basis, while he thinks marriage would be dull routine.  Birdy knows he's stupid for seeking his old girlfriend, but more or less can't help himself.  Moe is happily married but tends to put his buddies above his homelife.  And Paul...  Is just Paul.The title is misleading.  It's more of 'Eccentric Middle Aged Guys With Personal Problems Procrastinate About Life' than 'Beautiful Girls,' but which is the more marketable title...Very good, very truthful, very well acted film, and the script is fresh and new.

It grabbed my attention immediately and never lost it. The plot is interesting and captivating; it revolves around Timothy Hutton, who plays Willie, a late-20's piano player who returns to his home town after ten years, to meet his old friends and celebrate the 10-years high-school reunion with them. When he arrives, he quickly finds out that nothing really has changed in the last decade, at least not for his friends and the town in general. His friends are all still struggling with their love lives, their family and their lives in general. Among those friends are Tommy(Matt Dillon), who has a girlfriend, and an affair with a married woman with a child; Michael (Noah Emmerich), who has settled down and gotten a family, and seems to be content and Paul(Michael Rapaport), who's girlfriend has just broken up with him, because he couldn't commit after a long relationship, and who almost worships models, because he is very hung up on beauty. Willie quickly meets the new neighbor, or, rather, the new neighbors teen girl, Marty(Natalie Portman), who almost immediately casts her love on him, despite their obvious age difference. The entire cast does a great job; Timothy Hutton plays a great somewhat happy guy, who realizes that no one in his home town, where he grew up, have moved on, done something with their life, like he has. Matt Dillon gives a great performance as the former high school stud, who can't give up on either of the girls in love with him. Noah Emmerich plays a believable dependent father, who can't seem to raise his kids without his wife's help. Michael Rapaport portrays the hopeless dreamer who couldn't settle down with his girlfriend, and can't get over his ex. Natalie Portman gives a great performance as the Lolita-like Marty, who falls in love with someone she knows, deep down, that she can't be with. The characters are all well-written and interesting, and, despite the fact that there are so many, they all get the screen-time they deserve and require. I also enjoyed and somewhat liked every single character; even the one played by Rosie O'Donnell, who I normally loathe, was entertaining and interesting. The humor in the film is great, it doesn't seem forced and it just blends in. The film doesn't have any of the cliches often associated with dramas that have a high school reunion in them. The actors all have great chemistry, and really make you believe that they *are* that character, not just an actor playing a part. I liked the Wizard of Oz theme and references, though I'm not entirely sure what to make of them. Either the city was Kansas, or it was Oz. Anyway, all in all, a great drama, with great humor and great acting.

There's been some great movies dealing with relationship issues for teenagers, but there doesn't seem to be many movies made about that period in your mid-twenties when you're trying to figure out what you want out of life, and who you want to spend it with. The cast are all great and I especially liked Paul, who added some comic relief. Rosie O'Donnell playing Gina also has a great scene lambasting the guys for their immaturity. One criticism that could be made is that it's a movie made of set pieces, but I think that's inevitable when you're concentrating on so many different characters and make them all identifiable and well rounded. Due to the snowy backdrop and small town setting I always think of this as a lovely Christmas movie. Grab a tipple and some chocolates and snuggle under your favourite blanket and give it a watch.

Why do we want what we want, can we even realize the value of what we have unless we face its absence? All questions which can be discussed at length, which have been discussed at length since the dawn of time. Beautiful Girls doesn't claim to have all the answers, it only wants to convince us that we can find them with an open mind and an open heart.The many flawed yet charming and unique characters who are depicted in this story are in a struggle to trace their path back to the roots of their issues before they are allowed to carve a path towards personal growth, peace and happiness, as symbolized by Willie's return to his hometown for a high-school reunion. Many of these people are described with a naive honesty that fits in well with the small town covered by snow imagery, a fantasy of purity, simplicity and wholesomeness which covers up a lot of dirt. Perhaps the snowplowing is the unifying metaphor in this movie. As more and more issues are resolved, for example as we see Paul open the driveway of Jan, we see snow disappearing from the roads. Last scene of the movie we see Kev with the snowplow truck driving on clear roads, freed from snow at last, in contrast with an earlier scene in the movie as Willie is picked up at the bus station by Mo, we see the roads were covered in snow. In a sense, snow becomes the element which blocks the roads towards progress, symbolizing being stuck, frozen in life.I like these kinds of small town, small people movies. They teach us that meaningful stories that have things to tell about human nature don't always have to come in epic packages, have to be tied to events of epic proportions, that the significance of events, relations etc. can not solely be measured by the number of people they end up effecting, that true adversity can and does often come from internal conflicts which can't be solved by brute force like external conflicts.Take for example Willie's relationship with Marty. On the surface it's creepy for sure, but Willie isn't really after a sexual relationship. He's looking for and finding in her what he's been missing in his life A bright future full of possibilities, an inquisitive mind that isn't afraid to ask/question, a courageous heart not afraid to take risks, a pure soul not tainted by years of accumulated cynicism and tiredness that come with the harsh realities of everyday struggle as an adult. He sees in her a glimpse of his own childhood and wants to grasp on to it, for growing up means he has to come to terms with the possibility that his dreams might never come true.All in all, a very well made movie whose layers peel away one by one to reveal a beautiful core in the end.

A high school reunion is the focal point of each individual subplot. Timothy Hutton arrives home on a winter morning and encounters a preteen wise beyond her years. Michael Rapaport plays his best friend who recently broke up with his girlfriend but he has an obsession with supermodels. Matt Dillon's girlfriend is faithful yet he desires his married high school flame. There is a great moment where Rosie O'Donnell addresses mere fantasies and real women. Subplots are detailed thanks to director Ted Demme who also made The Ref. Great ensemble cast with Hutton confused with his feelings because he hesitates commitment. Dillon realizes potential consequences when affairs aren't necessarily unseen. Rapaport lives in denial of what he could have verses what he cannot. Natalie Portman brings wit and intelligence as a preteen with a knack for words and the ability to see through Hutton. O'Donnell steals scenes with a witty performance trying to educate the boys on women. Easily one of the best films of the year with a teen target audience that needs to heed the messages presented.

Here he attends a high school reunion, and hangs out with various friends, two of whom are played Matt Dillon and Michael Rapaport.Like most school reunion movies, Beautiful Girls oozes regret. Each of Demme's leads is struggling to reconcile how life really turned out with the fantasies, desires and expectations of youth. Encapsulating the seemingly unattainable idealisations of Demme's cast are two of the film's female characters a beautiful fantasy object, played by Uma Thurman, and an archetypal 'Lolita' character, played by a young Natalie Portman. Whilst both characters might be deemed sexist or offensive in another film, in Beautiful Girls that's the very point. Portman and Thurman's characters are the grotesque products of adolescent male fantasies. Portman would herself comment on this in interviews. Recognising that her character in Girls recalled her role in Luc Besson's Leon, another film with paedophillic overtones, Portman would admit pledging to avoid similar roles in the future. There's a surprising preponderance of that kind of role for young girls, she'd say. Fantasy objects for men; idealised purity combined with the fertility of youth. Beautiful Girls' reality/fantasy dichotomy is best seen during a pair of monologues. In the first, a young man who refuses to settle down with women who are not perfect, looks at a wall adorned with nude supermodels and says A beautiful girl can make you dizzy. She can make you feel high, full of the single greatest commodity known to man &#x96; promise. Promise of a better day. Promise of a greater hope. Promise of a new tomorrow. These supermodels, that's what they are bottled promises. Scenes from a brand new day! Hope dancing in stiletto heels! Countering this perspective is an angry rant delivered by one of the film's female characters They're beauty freaks! And they make all us normal women with our wrinkles, our puckered boobs, and our cellulite, feel somehow inadequate. Well I don't buy it, all right? And when you think there's a chance in hell that you'll end up with one of these women, you don't give us real women anything approaching a commitment. It's pathetic!Beautiful Girls climaxes with Demme's cast of men learning to accept the women in their lives. As women are largely absent from the picture, and as their wants are mostly overlooked, and as they're portrayed as always being second best to men's fantasies anyway, there's something creepy about this climax. Still, with its snow-capped towns and its fine cast of morose, working class man-boys, Beautiful Girls remains a fairly original picture.8/10 &#x96; See Diner, 10 Years, The Center of the World and Nobody's Fool.

Action-wise, there is not much here. But in ways of powerful and meaningful conversations, this movies proves how deep and thought-provoking it can be. The cast is all brilliant as we come to know each character and see their personal flaws. The storyline may not seem new, but the movie itself seems fresh for whatever odd reason.Ted Demme's film is about a group of 30-year-olds who reunite for a high school reunion. We see all their midlife crises and how their ideas for romance are changing. The main character Willy bonds with his 13-year-old neighbor as they give each other thoughts to think about.The acting is incredibly strong. I was able to care for each and every character thanks to the strong performances. One person in particular sticks out and that is Natalie Portman. The 13-year-old actress delivers a brave, stunning performance that truly captivated the minds and hearts of the audience.Overall, this is a smart, tight film that has a well-written script and wonderful acting. This film has some funny moments, but I would more classify this film as a dramedy. Amidst the frozen barren land of snow and ice, this film manages to warm our hearts and even bring back some memories. I rate this film 9/10.

The plot is something anyone would be interested and relate to, and it is well acted. I really wish the dialogue were written by someone maybe a little more earthy. There are some pretty cringe-worthy moments. In trying to capture a feeling of bro behavior, some of the dialog rings false, like it was either written by a woman who does not spend a lot of time with these types of men, or a man who does not have these kinds of friends.I know many men like the ones portrayed in the movie trapped in their own self-defeating fantasies and not particularly successful. If one of them began a conversation like the ones in the film, his friends would think he was speaking in a different language.I know Uma Thurman was cast as the token beautiful girl yet some of the lines she said just sounded silly, maybe like contrived intelligent remarks. There are many highly intelligent and precociously funny teens like Natalie Portman, but they would have never said things like daddy downer and brother bummer. That is the vernacular of a forty year old screenwriter. For a more realistic portrayal of the sharply sarcastic teen, watch Juno. I have taught for years and can see a vast difference in the two characters meant to appeal to older men.Bros like these would rather stick a needle in their eye rather than sit around a piano to sing Sweet Caroline to a girl they want to impress. Of all the dialogue and scenes, that seems the most artificial and contrived. I wish it were taken out of the film.I also have a few superficial quibbles...the actors do look much too old for a 10 year reunion. I am really ashamed of this particular complaint...but I sort of wish the characters had more 90's era style...to add some nostalgia. No one has any style. Also the soundtrack is horrific.

My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script.Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with his career going nowhere as a musician and his relationship stuck due to his commitment phobia. He decides to comeback to his hometown to attend his high school reunion while catching up on his old friends Tommy (Matt Dillon), Mo (Noah Emmerich) and Paul (Michael Rapaport) each going through different phases in their life and relationships. When Willie thinks nothing could go any worse, he falls for a 13 year old Marty (Natalie Portman).There is a wicked sense of humor here commonly not associated with movies of that era. While the director treasures and elevates some key moments, also tries to keep it a little lighter and borderline quirky. What this movie required was not great performances but spontaneous ones and gets plenty of them from the able cast, especially little Natalie Portman. The background score could have been better except for the irritatingly catchy opening song which is used extensively throughout the movie. There is a little lull somewhere before the last quarter part of the movie, but picks up quite well leading to a predictable yet well executed finish.A rare male perspective romantic comedy with a superb spontaneous ensemble performance "},{"Title":"A Feel Good Movie that actually makes you Feel Good!","Date":"22 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I absolutely LOVE this movie.

After seeing portions of it then, I had always caught either the middle of the film, the very ending or somewhere between the opening credits and closing music. Though never seeing the movie in it's entirety until October 2010, (finally), I have always been fascinated by it, enthralled and completely sucked in to it, grasping at every spoken word, every poignant, touching scene; laughing, crying and basically loving every moment of this highly underrated movie. Even the little snowy Ridge town, somewhere in Minnepolis is just the perfect setting for the reunion of high school pals, Tommy, Willy, Kev, Mo and Paul. I am not exactly sure why, but this movie touches my very heart and soul, not so much that I can relate to the characters, the locale (I being a Southern California boy) or even the happy, drunken camaraderie of the friends of The Ridge, but there is a reality about it that just keeps you hanging on to every word and moment. Timothy Hutton is as usual, brilliant as Willy, the buddy who moved away from The Ridge to become a working piano player. His taboo, yet innocent relationship with Marty, a 13 year old girl who is an old soul, wise beyond her years is so touching,and his scenes with Andera in the bar and ice fishing shack, played wonderfully by Uma Thurmond are worthy of rewinding over and over and over again. I have yet to purchase this movie and but I guarantee when I do there will be a ton of rewinding and even more repeated viewing. So I urge you all, search for this movie at home, or better yet, buy it on DVD, sit down in front of the TV on a chilly fall or winter night (with a bottle of wine if you're of the age), in front of the warm glow of the fire and experience in my humble opinion, a great movie filled with characters you will love, some you may know and some you may not care for too much at all, but trust me, you will love this movie.

In The Deer Hunter, the friendship of the blue collar small town guys and their relationship with their town was merely a backdrop to a larger story, but in Beautiful Girls it's the whole story. That's not a bad thing - after all, few can deny that The Deer Hunter's slice of small town, working class American life is Hollywood film-making at its best.The title is a bit of a red herring, this movie is really about a group of twenty-something men, all on different life paths, but clearly still close-knit from their high school glory days. All women, even the beautiful girls, are secondary characters, but they all play their roles well in this movie about a group of guys most Americans can probably relate to.Even if you didn't grow up in a small town you will still see your friends in the archetypal characters of Beautiful Girls. The lovable loser, the one who made it out of town, the one who wanted to but failed, the one who settled down with a family while everyone else was out partying still, and so on. The Boys are all flawed, but their flaws are understandable and nothing too reprehensible. It really ends up being a halfway realistic crew of guys who aren't purely sinners or saints. Just like you and your friends, most likely.Beautiful Girls isn't epic film-making, but it's not a soap opera either. It's the thinking man's version of a chick flick, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

A young man returns to his old town for his high school reunion and has to fight with both feelings and reality.The lead character is Willie (Timothy Hutton), who as a failed pianist in the Big Apple returns to see his family and his old chums, among which Tommy (Matt Dillon) is the only one with substance. Willie and Tommy each have to solve an important problem, one a potential marriage with a nice-but-not-so-nice New York lawyer, the other saving his relationship with a girl that he cheats, respectively. Hutton and Dillon give solid and believable interpretations of the troubled characters, with Hutton the city-like in-trouble fellow and Dillon the likable thug. The other characters do not really stand out, except perhaps the young Marty (Natalie Portman) who like a Lolita increases the pressure on Willie. Oh, and Mira Sorvino's acting made me grade this movie an 8 instead of a 9.The story is linear, but the dialogues are interesting and there are interesting twists (usually provided by the episodic girls). You also get a nice feeling watching the fellows together or seeing what the ones that 'stayed' are doing for a living or in their personal lives (hint none of them has a dead soul). The director sets the correct pace for this film and lets the lead characters develop nicely. There is a great deal of talking, but there is also always something happening. The visuals are good-looking, succeeding in depicting the small American town in mid-winter in an attractive way. Not much to say about the other senses, which detracts a bit from the message of the movie (one could imagine a scene in which the guys do a BBQ, or have a nice family dinner with filled plates).

And then I'll be Pooh to your Christopher Robin. That's the saddest thing I've ever heard, says the pond-ice-skating 13-year-old Marty (Natalie Portman) after she professes her affections for 28-year-old Willie (Timothy Hutton), who proceeds to explain what happens when people outgrow things they no longer need.But it's true. You'll go through changes. And I can't be a Pooh. The best of all high school reunion films, Ted Demme's Beautiful Girls takes us to a small town and keeps us there, managing to accomplish this through stark honesty.In this truly underrated gem, we don't have a protagonist coming home to mom baking cookies and numerous well-to-do siblings talking politics while carrying infants in their bosoms. Here we have Willie (Hutton), a quiet, unassertive piano player who returns to snowy Knight's Ridge, Massachusetts to a lower-middle-class house, a shy, aimless brother (David Arquette) and an uncommunicative widower father (Richard Bright) who after years of his son's absence can only manage to say, There's some golf on the TV. Do you wanna watch some golf? We also meet his childhood buddies, including the handsome Birdie (Matt Dillon), the loser Paul (Michael Rapaport), and family man Mo (Noah Emmerich), all of whom are alcoholics, largely out-of-luck in relationships/careers, and have never left Knight's Ridge.Willie knows the difference. He misses his identity, but knows exactly why he left his one-horse town. He's been a struggling artist in New York for years. He knows himself and his dreams, and to settle for anything less would be a step backward. Still, it's precisely why he's not totally in love with his big city attorney girlfriend, Tracy (Annabeth Gish), and why he is so drawn to the precocious old soul Marty (Portman), a teenage girl who inconveniently still rides bikes and builds snowmen in the yard next door. For Willie, Marty is a soul-mate, someone who really understands him, a perfect match to complement his complicated heart.His buddies are slightly less complicated, but no less tortured in their contemplations about identity and happiness. Birdie is neck-deep in an affair with his high school flame Darien (Lauren Holly), who is married with a child. And the clueless Paul can't handle his relationship with Jan (Martha Plimpton) because he's blinded by illusions of what-else-is-out-there, wall-papering his apartment with pictures of beautiful girls which to him signify hope. Watch for the bumbling moment where he succumbs and proposes to Jan with a half-assed excuse for an engagement ring. Either plowing snow or drinking beer in every scene, Dillon and Rapaport are pitch-perfect here depicting the comic dramas of blue-collar life.The women are just as fun. Holly makes for a nasty little villain-- a grown-up version of a Mean Girl, while Mira Sorvino plays Birdie's loyal-to-a-fault girlfriend who desperately wants to believe he loves her despite his cheating. Uma Thurman makes a brief, memorable appearance as the hifalutin' hot girl from Chicago, and Rosie O'Donnell has a great scene berating the boys as she explains the false illusions of beautiful girls at the magazine rack in a drugstore.But the quintessential scenes are with Willie and Marty. Portman plays the would-be neighborhood Lolita with confidence and deep empathy. Hutton complements her with equal parts of adoration, love and confusion. We know it's totally wrong for them to be an item, but we crave more scenes with them together. We understand their mutual attraction and respect their love. It's really a moving relationship.But don't forget this is a comedy. And it's got really funny moments, like the boys' rambling diatribes while ice-fishing, accusing one another of eating retard-sandwiches, or evaluating women on a 1-10 rating scale while playing video games. Because the boys are flawed, we believe they're real people, like neighborhood kids we used to play in little league with. We're totally there when Mo loses it after Birdie gets beat up by Steve Rossmore (Darien's husband). Mo grips Rossmore (Sam Robards) by his collar, throwing him against the wall ready to beat him up, until Rossmore's 5-year-old daughter knocks on the screen door saying Daddy, what's going on? At that moment, all the men realize they're not kids anymore. They're adults. They have grown up, even though they don't know how it happened.Seattle Times' critic John Hartl wrote upon the film's release, here's a movie where we begin to miss the characters the moments the end credits start to roll and he's absolutely right. In two hours, I felt like I got to know Willie-boy, Paulie, Birdie, Mo, and the other townies as if I grew up with them. It made me miss my real childhood friends, and it still gets me whenever I think about leaving my 12-year-stint in Los Angeles and heading back to my roots in Seattle. It's a personal film for me, but I'm willing to bet it'll be a charmer for anyone else. I often revisit the film to imagine what life might be like in a smaller town with down-to-earth values. Sometimes that makes me sentimental. But on other occasions I pop this movie in for the same reason I enjoy visiting home-- to spend time with old friends, hang out and chat like nothing else matters, with the luxury of time to really contemplate life. After as many viewings of this movie as I've had, the Knight's Ridge boys have become those old friends.As Willie leaves in the final scene, one of the guys says from the driver's side of a snowplow window See ya Willie. Stay cool. Stay cool forever. It's the way those strange moments of parting are expressed in real life. It's bittersweet, but real. Here, we become Willie, driving away and leaving the old home to return to our current life. But still, we're tempted to think about planning our next visit.

A terrific cast, a wonderful script (Scott Rosenberg) and sensitive but masterful direction (Ted Demme).Everyone in the film is a beautifully observed human being... with faults and redeeming qualities in equal measure. You've probably met all of them at some point in your life. The film takes place in a cold, northern town covered in snow. It follows the lives of a group of friends who have known each other all their lives, but especially since college days. Timothy Hutton's piano player character, Willie Conway, comes home for a few days to make a pivotal personal decision and visit his brother and widowed father. He revisits his old friends and quickly slips back into their world. We meet the guy who has taken on marriage and kids and loves them (Noah Emmerich), the college 'birdman' (Matt Dillon) who still lives on his reputation and spends his nights with an old flame, and another man's wife, Darian Smalls (Lauren Holly).There's Kev (a stunning performance by Max Perlich - totally understated and completely real... check out the way he moves his hands and legs while playing the video game), the loudmouth armchair pseudo-philosopher (Michael Rapaport... the best thing I've seen him do), the loyal, female cuckold girlfriend (Mira Sorvino)... the list goes on and on, with every performance absolutely spot on. Uma Thurman as Andera... the beautiful girl that visits from out of town and causes the men to re-examine their positions in life.Should Willie marry the girl he has met in Chicago? Should he consider waiting until the cute 'old soul' 13-year-old that's moved in next door to his father (Natalie Portman in one of her very best performances) is old enough? No aliens, sea monsters, car chases or apocalyptic events, just a slice of real life amongst a cast of characters that are brought to life by a writer, director and cast at the height of their combined and (possibly) individual powers.A real winner.

Hutton reconnects with childhood buds Matt Dillon (as Tommy Birdman Rowland), Michael Rapaport (as Paul Kirkwood), Noah Emmerich (as Michael Mo Morris), and Max Perlich (as Kev). Hutton also meets his new neighbor, 13-year-old Natalie Portman (as Marty); and, the two are mutually attracted.Ted Demme's Beautiful Girls is less about the title, and more about four men in the elongated winter of their staggered comings of age. Mr. Emmerich, a father, is the farthest along; and, Mr. Perlich is still a child. The other three men have more interesting stories. The most intriguing is the touchingly written (by Scott Rosenberg) romance between Hutton and Ms. Portman. But, the best story is the secondary one performed by Mr. Dillon, who must face the fact that he reached his peak of popularity in high school, and will find more happiness being common.Mr. Rapaport's gives the film's most satisfying performance; it's an even greater achievement, when you consider the stellar cast. It helps that snow-plowing Rapaport seems to be the right age for his part. Like Dillon's Tommy, Rapaport's character matures; although, instead of realizing the Beautiful Girl, he favored fantasizing. Rosie O'Donnell's bombastic explanation of the idealized Penthouse model is a highlight. The cast may be too star-studded for the film's own good; which is, perhaps, why some of the film's relationships are not entirely convincing. Still, the direction (by Ted Demme), stories (Rosenberg), and several performances, are excellent.******* Beautiful Girls (1996) Ted Demme ~ Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport "}{"Title":"Did anyone else notice?","Date":"2 June 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Was this movie the basis for the TV show October Road?

There are, of course, several stories going on here, the most interesting being a triangle with Willie's best friend (Matt Dillon)juggling his current girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) and his married mistress (Lauren Holly) who he claims to have broken up with and Willie's fascination with a 12 year old girl who lives next door. This variation on a theme is no more or no less entertaining than any of the others, but it does boast an attractive cast, with a star-making turn by young Natalie Portman as the aforementioned 12 year old...the kind of role that Portman would soon be playing in her sleep. Uma Thurman, Michael Rapaport, Max Perlich, Rosie O'Donnell, and Martha Plimpton also have their moments in the sun. And if you don't blink, you'll see a very young David Arquette playing Willie's little brother. It's not Merchant Ivory, but there's some clever writing and the cast works hard for your attention.

Unfortunately, the poor goon with the greatest lines about women, the one who romanticizes about them the most, is left out with his fantasies at the end.....the losers in the ice house.Since I live in Ma. I loved the shots of winter in the Northeast. Since I live on a lake, the iced up waters with the townfolk skating around are simply very beautiful and realistic. The writing in this show was fantastic and I think Demme or some of the others have some Ma. blood in them, since the attitudes of smalltime guys grown and growing up (even when over 30) was so REAL. Tim Hutton and Matt Dillon are of course enough alike to be brothers, and played well with one another. The loser, hooked into an adulterous affair with a real high school sweetheart, showing her bitchiness, finally finds out what's real in life and gets on with it.That's what the movie is really all about, how guys finally get their fecal matter together and grow up, told in a wonderful little town in the lower middle-class strata of white society.I have noticed that Matt Dillon is in many gems of movies such as this one with great character parts and a plot that deals with 'jes' livin'.'

So take me with a grain of salt. I'll be a bit biased.You have a person (Dutton) that quite probably escaped home to become a bar pianist because of reasons--which are made readily apparent in the young smart teen's (Natalie Portman) observation--that he has daddy downer and brother bummer. He returns to his hometown, with feeling a bit bad about not doing the normal thing, like getting a sales job and having a family, thinking about dropping the piano gig, etc. Meanwhile, his high-school buddies, also having their own regrets and issues, seem to have not aged a bit in their attitudes. But, we find out they have, each in their own way.Mostly, the script is excellent, if only slightly cheesy at times. But, it is really hard not to like this film. Contrary to some other comments, the dialogue seems to be well done and very natural. The script is simple and realistic and accomplishes that without becoming pretentious and full of itself.It is not an avant-garde art film with a statement, but rather a look on a sort of life decision, if you will. Have other movies done this same twenty-something theme? Of course. That doesn't bother me.It appears that everybody seems to go on about how Natalie Portman made the movie, and believe me, her performance quite easily allows you to you fall in love with the character Marty, but I think there was a general chemistry in all of the performances which makes it all the worthwhile to watch, and hopefully enjoy. Rappaport was excellent, and also Matt Dillon, which some people may think had a relatively simple role. And Timothy Dutton is great, even, as it were, that somebody in an earlier comment said give him a comb. I think that person missed the point.To sum up, it makes for a good flick if you can relate to the characters and, just maybe, if you cannot. I'm giving it a 9/10.

While most of the members of this terrific ensemble cast brilliantly take on the traditional roles of high school melodrama -- from love affairs to street fights -- Timothy Hutton, Uma Thurman, and Natalie Portman give perspective to the inherent difficulties we have reconciling love and friendship, growing up and settling down, and wanting to put yourself in someone else's shoes.Hutton returns to his small hometown for a ten-year high school reunion to dredge up fond memories, but he also inevitably remembers why he left. He quickly develops love affairs of the mind with Thurman, a beautiful and mysterious visitor who he easily could have fallen for under different circumstances, and Portman, the precocious child next door who, desperately wanting to grow up, falls for him. These short-lived relationships provide simple, poignant, relevant insights as the trio struggles on different levels with what it means to be in love and whether or not the grass is always greener. And even if we assume the worst, at least we can always count on old friends for a good time.Nostalgia runs amok in this undervalued triumph of a feel-good flick. You'll find yourself wanting to call an old friend, head out to the neighborhood bar, and find Sweet Caroline on the jukebox play list.

How can a story line about a guy returning home for his 10 year H/S Reunion, and falling for his 13 year old neighbor, be so believable and well done. I read one review that describe Natalie Portman at that age as follows  It's as if Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster were somehow genetically melded at an early age. She's definitely a beautiful girl to watch for. I quote that because I can't take credit for it, but it is the truest thing I've read in years. And history has proved it to be right. Cudos to everyone involved in this movie!! Also, no one has touched on the most original, goofy guy dialog in years. The conflict over whether to go to the H/S Reunion, or stay home to watch a Rich Man / Poor Man marathon on TV. Has there ever been a more evil, sinister villain than Falconette??

She gets you and you get her but the problem is . . . well you can't be with her, whether its because she's already with someone, or she lives far away or in the case of this movie she's 13?Well that my friends is the real problem in Beautiful Girls which is the story of a group of twenty somethings who all have relationship problems and try and figure them out over the course of 3 weeks before their high school reunion. The movie contains many established, and up-and-coming stars like Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, and Natalie Portman. I liked the movie in so many ways because its was beautifully shot, and maybe even more beautifully written. While not a ground breaking film in its content( it owes much to the big chill) it is still a very well done movie with some fine thoughts about love, life, and what it means to really connect with someone.Now back to the original thought I was having about not being able to be with someone because she's so young, well in this movie that would be Timothy Hutton's character Willie who comes home trying to figure out if he really wants to be with his nice attorney girlfriend of roughly a year. Thats when he meets the next door neighbor Marty. She's precocious, very intelligent, witty, cool, and even at the tender age of 13 you can see she's going to be one very gorgeous girl (Natalie Portman had one of her finest performances here might I add). They bond during their first talk together because Marty sees right into and through Willie who doesn't realize he's already smitten.Yes I know this sounds disgusting. A 27 year old guy falling for a 13 year old? But no its tastefully done. Willie just see's something in her he can't help but like and through some very well conceived scenes admits to being jealous of a 13 year old kid on a bike who is flirting with Marty while he looks through the window at them. This my friends is the heart of the movie and while they devoted a good bit of time to it with such a large cast of characters my only knock on the movie is that they should have made it more center stage. The movie ends well and all seems good with good stories and excellent performances.What i'd really like to see is a sequel with Willie now divorced and Marty now 23 and how they reconnect after 10 years and see if a romance is at all possible.

When he gets there it's clear what memories he had about the place, are now completely changed. His friends have lives of their own as they stayed in town. Some are happily married and adjusted, as is the case with Mo. Some are married, but unhappy, Tommy is the perfect example. Some have never been able to achieve happiness like Paul who is in love, but the object his affections doesn't return his love.In fact, Willie seems like a fish out of water. He has left behind a girlfriend who loves him, but meeting the precocious 13 year old girl- next-door Marty, presents a problem for him. He likes the young girl even though he knows it's something he can't have.So go the different stories in Beautiful Girls a film that takes a look at the realities of life as years go by. Ted Demme, the director, has transferred Scott Rosenberg's vision to the screen using some amazing talented actors to portray the different characters in the movie.Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport, Natalie Portman, Mira Sorvino, Annabeth Gish, Noah Emmerich, do excellent work under Mr. Demme's guidance.

It is very rare to see a picture where such a diverse set of actors gel so convincingly with each other. From the mature and outstanding Nathalie Portman to the hilarious Rosie O'Donnell, it is the casting that gives this exceptional coming of age comedy-drama its edge. The sentimental yet bitter direction helps create a simple yet complex setting packed with a lot of history. The basic premise of a group of twentysomethings going to their high school reunion with a plethora of love related issues may not sound remotely original, but the manner in which the late Ted Demme uses character and setting to help promote a sharp and at times moving script help keep this picture above the rest of other 'friends reunited' films out there. This underrated and 'under seen' picture consists of an ensemble worthy of being compared to Kevin Kline's in The Big Chill and Hugh Grant's in Four Weddings. The chemistry between Timothy Hutton and co shines off the screen as if you were there drinking and singing with them yourself thanks to the director who uses a strong sense of humanity as a major tool in telling this emotional tale. Something rarely done in the film industry nowadays.With a fantastic soundtrack and an inviting title for any red blooded man, it is a must see for all who have loved and lost on any level.

The first thing that comes to mind is a chick-flick in which a bunch of uber-feminists discuss how much they hate men; starring Kim Cattrall, Mimi Rogers and Nastassja Kinski. Ironically, this movie is quite the opposite, but that's not to say that it's chauvinist in any way. As well as that, this is an ensemble movie. In terms of the ensemble, this can be closer resembled to `200 Cigarettes' than `Magnolia' if you know what I mean. A big problem that affects this genre is the unequal division of screen-time, colourful quips etc. that is given to each character. Thankfully, `Beautiful Girls' is one of the few films that avoids this problem by creating properly developed characters. Though it is fair to say that many of the characters are much the same in the `shallow-with-hidden-depth' type of way. This holds true to the overall shape of the film. At first glance, this seems like `Men Behaving Badly The Movie', but if you look closer, it goes beyond this with a soft-centre that brings depth and meaning to it all. Then if you look really, really close you'll find that you're back to square one, but try not to look that close. While it has nowhere particular to go, this makes the most of itself in its 2 hour running time as we meet a huge array of characters.Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People) is a suitably un-quirky lead. Matt Dillon is compelling to watch as the hopelessly flawed low-life, while the characters played by Pruitt Taylor Vince (Simone, Nurse Betty) and Noah Emmerich (The Truman Show, Crazy in Alabama) are much the same, not that that's a bad thing. Michael Rapaport is thoroughly convincing as a sleaze bag, but then again, a dwarf is brilliant at being small (if you know what I mean). Fortunately, David Arquette's brief part is mercifully short and almost goes by un-noticed. Female support is top notch, in particular from Lauren Holly and Oscar winner Mira Sorvino who are impressive as the jealous b*tch and caring counterpart, respectively. Natalie Portman shows plenty of talent in her scenes, but simply doesn't pass for a 13-year-old. Uma Thurman's presence has a great effect and is good as expected as the sultry temptress. Rosie O'Donnell gets the quirkiest character along with some of the best lines (`Girls with big t*ts have big asses', `You know who you look like- Ally Sheedy'). But the parts played by Max Perlich, Annabeth Gish and Martha Plimpton just seem like a throwback to the rest of the characters.Tremendously original direction from the late Ted Demme helps elevate this to the next level. He gives it the required light-touch, bringing a pleasantly warm glow to the proceedings. It may not be in the style of ensemble master, Robert Altman (mainly because it's not a satire), but it gets one thing that Altman could never achieve- heart.With a sharp and witty script along with one of the best casts assembled in quite a while, `Beautiful Girls' is a fun `easy-on-the-eye' picture. This is a very good example of ensemble acting. While it is virtually without a plot, it still maintains a compelling pace and leaves a satisfying taste. My IMDb rating 7.1/10.

By beautiful is to be understood their thoughts and behaviors, not necessarily their physical appearances, although all are attractive enough for their individual reasons.  The guy characters, on the other hand, are conventionally loutish and full of themselves.  From that premise the characters develop more depth and introspection as the plot continues, and in fact the plot becomes but a vehicle for that cultivation.

I was pulled in by the richness of the environment, the confusion of the characters, and the underlying message... that elusive underlying message. I'm not sure whether to feel happy for Willy that he is leaving with his girlfriend, or sad that he didn't choose to moment the truth and wait for that girl who is that something beautiful that he has been looking for.

There are several scenes of enjoyable, realistic dialog that don't particularly forward the plot in any direction -- these scenes (like Timothy Hutton's scene with Uma Thurmann in the Ice Fishing shack) lend depth to the characters by letting them say what a person might actually say.

Everyone does a fantastic job in this film, particularly Natalie Portman, Rosie O'Donnell and Timothy Hutton. The film dwells a lot on the male perception of relationships and the way they view the opposite sex. The film is very talky, but its part of its charm. The best scenes are between Portman and Hutton, where 13 year old Portman gives Hutton advice about relationships and life- which actually seem to make sense. Its all about the age old debate about why guys cant settle down, why they seem to always mess up the good relationships and why they all have a preoccupation with girls that are or look like models. Yes, some of its very superficial, but then unfortunately its also incredibly realistic in its delve into the male psyche. These are fully developed characters, which the actors have managed to bring to life. Probably not a film that everyone will enjoy, but for some of us it has something that most films lack- being an element of truth, and a touch of realism. Highly recommended.

Because of the time, and channel, I didn't expect much, but was really surprised.I watched the movie in the winter, late at night, when outside the window was complete silence.  No birds chirping, too damn cold.  It really set the mood for the movie.I think the reason I liked this movie, and even the reason I am compelled to write about it basically revolves around the fact that I am 20 years old, going into my 3rd year university, and dangerously close to the big fade.This movie hit home for me.  There is an astonishing warmth to the story, especially the bar scene, where they sing 'Sweet Caroline.'  I have experienced what the movie subtly suggests.  After high school, we all went our separate ways.  The guys I used to hang around in school, I see maybe once a year now.  Things change, people change.  And in about 5-6 years when I go to my 10 year high school reunion, we are all going to be blown away at how different we have become; maybe even not as compatable.So many of my friends seem as shallow as Michael Rapaport's character did initially, even myself sometimes.  I think alot of people get old without growing up.  Whatever the case may be, this movie connects with alot of people.Another point I would like to make is that I do not think people who live in big cities, like NY or Toronto, cannot really get the feel for this movie like others can.  I didn't grow up in the city, but live in one now.  The movie makes an excellent portrayal of small town isolation, even contrasts it to big city life at the beginning.  And nothing changes in the small town.  People age, but don't really change.I could identify with Willie easily.  I moved away from home to go to school, and it changed me.  I didn't notice until I came back home.  You drift from your friends you held so close at one time.There are many things I could say about this movie, but attempting to explain them would undermine the genuine quality of the film.  Definitely a movie for the youth of the 80's, 90's.  Our generation's Big Chill.If you watch this movie, it will make you make you a little depressed at times, but it's worth it, because in the end, you'll feel as cozy as if you were sitting by the fireplace in the bar during the Sweet Caroline scene.

I have a feeling there are a lot of teenage boys making these comments.

Portman is the element that really made this film, and ultimately destroyed it.  The film's focus is supposed to be Willie and his inability to take on the responsibilities and commitments that adult life bring and his relationship with Marty is just one of the film's many sub-plots.  But it is down to the tremendous talent of Portman that it is all you end up interested in.  You find yourself waiting for Willie's and Marty's next meeting and everything else in-between becomes slightly irritating.  Willie states that it is not a sexual thing and he's right - indeed one of the many special things about their relationship is its purity.  Their scenes consist entirely of conversations with no hint of a Lolita style subtext - it is completely psychological.  You have to give credit to Rosenberg for these excellently written scenes but it is Portman who makes them work by turning in a tremendously subtle performance.  She made an interesting debut in Leon, but in this her performance is something special.  She is note perfect in her progression from a wise-beyond-her-years young woman to heartbroken teenager.  One of the more intriguing things about Portman's performance was her use of body language (facial expressions inparticular) - very accomplished by the most seasoned actors' standards thus demonstrating her complete command of the role.  I really wish Demme had capitalised on Portman's performance and focused more on her and Willie's relationship even if it had meant altering the slant of the film.  Portman, with her role in Star Wars, is set for stardom but I don't think this is the right path for her.  With Anywhere But Here she seems to be heading for mainstream cinema and she really is too talented for Hollywood to put her to good use.  She ought to take a leaf out of Christina Ricci's book (the only serious 'rival' to Natalie in my view) and check out the independent scene, or even European cinema.

If there's a complaint it's the women characters aren't as well drawn as the men, and I've never been a fan of Lauren Holly's, so she doesn't do anything for me here.  But everything else feels right, and avoids getting too sentimental.  Nothing major really happens here, despite the talk of life decisions, it's just people trying to figure out which direction they want their lives to take, which is what we do every day.  And somehow it's satisfying to see a high school reunion movie that only has one scene there, with only one of the major characters.Scott Rosenberg has always been good, it seems, at writing dialogue, and this movie is no exception; the women may get short shrift when it comes to character, but they get great lines, and so do the men.  It feels like realistic dialogue too.  And all the performances are good, but the one to watch out for, of course, is Natalie Portman.  With the STAR WARS movie and ANYWHERE BUT HERE, two major movies, waiting in the wings, it'll be interesting to see if she can become a star, and I hope she does, because she's just wonderful here.

At first glance it would seem that the title of the film comes from the three beautiful girls, plus Rosie O'Donnell, shown on the cover of the DVD box. However, it isn't -- several of the male characters in this small town worship beautiful girls, models, movie stars, and because of that can't look at their own girlfriends realistically, thus the title. In a truly great monologue in the grocery store, with three of the men following her, Rosie explains how those people don't really exist, and if they did, after the sex is no longer a novelty, there has to be more there to hold your interest. In this film, and League of Their Own, Rosie proves she is a much better actress than she is a talk show host. But all these side stories, Michael Rappaport losing Martha Plimpton because he can't commit, Matt Dillon having an affair with Lauren Holly because his wife was no longer exciting, Uma Thurman as the exciting out-of-towner, are just part of setting the stage. The core story is the piano player, Tim Hutton, living in New York, who has come back to his hometown for a class reunion, and while he waits for his lawyer girlfriend, Annabeth Gish, wonders if he really loves her. He meets the 13-yr-old kid next door, a very mature Natalie Portman who tries to convince him he should wait 5 years for her, that they would be great together. He actually muses over whether that would even be a possibility. In the end he realizes what it's all about, what jerks he and his friends have been, what he has in his girlfriend, and they drive away to New York, destined to be happy. He realized what Rosie said was right on. And he tells Portman that she will change very much in the next 5 years, and when she is 18 won't even remember him. So, he accomplishes two things, gets his own head straight, partly through this interesting kid, and gives her some guidance for her formative years. Overall a very well written, clever, and often funny film with a good message. Highly recommended, except there is quite a bit of R-rated language, but no sex or nudity.The DVD is as basic as they come, only ProLogic sound, no extras at all. Still, it is better than a VHS tape.Aug 2015 update I have seen this movie perhaps 8 or 10 times over the past 13 years and each time it strikes me anew, it is just a superb movie with interesting stories about life and relationships.

However, the scenes between Hutton and Portman are fantastic.  Both have an onscreen chemistry that is wonderful to watch.  The dialogue between the two is some of the best of 1996.

The problems (and characters) are familiar as are the outcomes. However this IS well-written and it has a cast of great actors who pull it all through. I was honestly never bored and it was a shock seeing Portman so young. Also there's one sequence that stops the movie when O'Donnell tells off Willy and Tom about sex, woman and relationships. O'Donnell is right on target here and hilarious. It was beautifully filmed (in Nova Scotia I believe) and has a great soundtrack. It's not perfect though.

How long will he stay?  Will he go back to his girlfriend in the big city?  Will he become an office equipment salesperson?  As the movie progresses we see Hutton's old high school comrades all stuck back at home in dead end jobs in small town New England with their glory days well behind them.  This especially holds true for  Dillon's character who was Joe popular in high school and is now being used by his former high school sweetheart who left Dillon to marry a wealthy man.  Yet, the Dillon's ex girlfriend still uses him for sexual purposes from time to time.  We actually see the entire cast of male characters in this film evolve (some more than others and as much as certain characters are capable of doing).  We see the largest transformation in this film with Hutton's character.  Hutton's discovery eventually, is that his current life is actually pretty good and he as a person is a lot better off than if he had stayed in small town New England with his high school cohorts.  He accomplishes this transformation with the help of a 13-year-old girl who lives next door and Uma Thurman's character.  We also see Dillon discover that he wants a long term commitment with his current girlfriend and the character that plows snow into his ex girlfriends driveway eventually starts removing snow by the movie's end.  We also see the aggressive character realize that physical violence is not always the answer and that the man he was going to beat up but did not, was someone's father.  There was also the character that had photos of models in his room stating that he wanted to marry someone that looked like that eventually realizing that it probably would not happen.  Every male character in this movie grew up in this film some to lesser and or greater degrees than others.  Hutton eventually decides to go back to Chicago?, New York? (there were New York license plates on the Saab) with his girlfriend after an altercation on the night of the reunion.  One of his friends states, (I can't remember who), as Hutton is leaving the hospital, we'll all be right here waiting for you if you ever decide to come back and visit.  That statement is not hard for the viewer or for Hutton's character to believe.  Hutton then walks out of the hospital, leaves the viewer sensing that Hutton is happy that he is moving on, and not stuck behind with his less well off high school friends in small town New England.  In short, the movie is about personal growth and growing up and then maybe moving on like Hutton's character did.

(Remember the movie Singles?) Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman have the best roles, but these too are one-dimensional and formulaic. If you want to see a much more realistic treatment of these themes please see the obscure independent film Mulletville. You won't be disappointed.But the script here--ye gods! It has Rosie O'Donnell telling the male characters that real women should look like her (!) and that men should quit admiring supermodels. Would you like a date with Rosie O'?The basic plot of the movie is that young rowdy small-town men need to give up' their irresponsible hell-raising and settle down with realistic women who don't look very pretty or glamorous.(Including Timothy Hutton's lawyer-girlfriend-- a lawyer girlfriend so responsible!)Well--in the economy of the past 10 years--2002-2012 --people do not get to settle down. --Their lives are too economically marginal!! Any average SEINFIELD episode is more realistic than this movie. And very few women actually want to look like Rosie O'Donnell (!).The script is so preachy --The bad girl --a married woman having an affair with her ex-boyfriend --is made up to look harsh and unsympathetic and she's portrayed as a neglectful mother too, deserving punishment. --Maybe in REAL life she has her own frustrations. Maybe she even likes her children if not her husband.This film's simplistic morality reminds me of the Gangster and Cowboy films of the 1930s--the guys are all hell-raisers running close to the wrong side of the law, but then their girlfriend has a baby and they learn responsibility --and then her Dad takes the guy into the family business and they raise a family.. Yeah--right. That world ended in the 1950s, if it ever really existed.So--what was your life like in 1996?--not like this movie I bet.

By name only, the cast of this flick is great.  But it has what must be the most poorly written script I have ever encountered.  If it weren't for Natalie Portman and Timothy Huttton, this could have gone down as the worst film of all-time.

There is absolutely no other reason to go anywhere near it unless you really like one of the people that made it.  This movie is just plain awful, and I just don't understand why so many big names would take part in this kind of c**p.  The story is as terrible as it is pointless, and the viewer is left to wonder what is going on.  Beautiful Girls is about Willie Conway (Timothy Hutton), a piano bar player in New York City, who returns home for a week for a high school reunion.  He has lots of decisions in his life to make, and so do his friends.  There are lots of relationship problems between many of the characters, and some new characters are introduced only to add to those problems as the movie develops.  Overall, it's just a terrible blend of characters and tremendous waste of talent and space.  It's one of the slowest paced movies you will ever come across and could easily put a meth addict in dreamland in only a few minutes.The only reason I came across this was because of Mira Sorvino, and while she does look good here, it's still a rotten movie that has no redeeming value whatsoever.  There are a lot of big names here, so don't be fooled into thinking that it's probably a decent movie, because it's not.  Don't talk yourself into seeing this because you like one of the characters either.  Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Mira Sorvino, Lauren Holly, Uma Thurman, Annabeth Gish, Natalie Portman and Rosie O'Donnell are no reason to see this movie.  If you go see this because one of those people are in this, you will be disappointed.  There are no nude scenes here, so don't count on that saving this either.  Only O'Donnell has at least one scene that's even mildly entertaining, and it doesn't make the movie worth watching, so don't bother.  Stay away from this one, stay as far away from it as you can.

It is filled with either extremely plain or really annoying plaid-wearing people. The main character Willie (Timothy Hutton) is the very definition of BORING!How he manages to charm little Marty (Natalie Portman) is a complete mystery, as he never says anything the least bit interesting.The director must have been eating retard-sandwiches, he should have known better than to cast Rosie O'Donnell and Michael Rapaport, they don't work as comic relief! The only wise decision the director made was to cast Natalie Portman, who is the only slightly amusing character in the whole film.The movie doesn't really have a storyline, and doesn't build up towards any excitement or climax. The only amusing part is the quasi-awkward romance between Willie and Marty, which isn't enough to make up for the rest of the movie...

The acting is fine, the movie is well acted. But the directors should have to oblige by resorting to Demme's perverted Lolita complex fantasies.See, I'd love to give this film higher than 1, but I can't because I can't justify this type of perverted fantasies from a director to spill over into his work.Yes, it's true Demme. You can't have sex with minors, but that doesn't mean you can still put the idea into people's heads into movies. I noticed you died of a cocaine-induced heart attack awhile back... "}]
