These were the vehicles the studios created for its stars of that era. It was either a Joan Crawford picture, or a Barbara Stanwyck, or a Bette Davis one, since their presence, bigger than life, was the only reason to bring these stories to the big screen.Take this one, for instance, under the direction of Irving Rapper. It had all the right elements, yet it was chaste enough to pass the censor. Undoubtedly, this movie owes a lot to the fantastic score by the talented Max Steiner who was a genius. Mr. Steiner's music plays the haunting melodies with such flair, we feel we are listening to a great symphonic work.The story, by today's standards wouldn't raise an eyebrow. At the time it came out, it was a different thing. After all, Jerry was a married man with a daughter and a situation that had no easy solution then. That makes Charlotte Vale suffer after she found her soul mate aboard the ship that served to free herself from a despotic mother.Bette Davis plays Charlotte to perfection. Her scenes with Paul Hendried lighting the two cigarettes is something to cherish by film fans. The chemistry that Bette Davis shared with her leading men was no small accomplishment. She was an actress that knew how to pull the heart strings of the general public. She had such a charisma and power to lose herself in all those strong women she played through the years. The transformation of the plain Charlotte to the smart woman, who embarks on a tour to begin a new life, is something out of a fairy tale, but Ms. Davis pulls it with great panache.The rest of the cast was excellent. Claude Rains, Gladys Cooper, Bonita Granville, Ilka Chase! They only come once in a lifetime. No one in present day Hollywood comes near to that. It was perfection.

His scenes with Bette Davis exude intelligence and warmth.I stopped to consider what a 2004 remake might look like - who could play the leads? Who would direct? What would the score be like?With no disrespect to anyone in the movie industry, I don't think a remake would ever be possible.The actors and technicians on this movie were truly masters of their craft.I defy anyone who watches the first ten minutes not to be hooked until the closing credits.

Obviously, Oscar voters could not bring themselves to vote for such a wicked mother that Cooper portrayed. (The following year Cooper gave another brilliant performance as the wretched nun in Song of Bernadette. She lost the Oscar because who would vote for a vicious nun?)No words are adequate to describe the outstanding Bette Davis performance in this film. Sorry, Greer Garson, Bette deserved this Oscar as she did so many. Her change from a hopelessly-drawn spinster to a ravishing beauty with all its torment can never be forgotten.

Many, for I'd assume it'd be hard-pressed for anyone not to at one point in their life gone through a period of dejection, rejection, and evolve until finally the inner self comes out shining.And what a character evolution this is. Charlotte Vale, played expertly and with fantastic repression hiding an enormous passion and will to live by the great Bette Davis as a woman who's life has been all but destroyed by her domineering, selfish mother (Gladys Cooper) until she meets kind Dr. Jasquith, a psychiatrist (Claude Rains) who makes her take the first steps to recovery. A physical transformation ensues from dowdy to chic, and on a cruise -- temporarily posing as Ms. Beauchamp -- she meets Jerry Durrance (elegant, smoldering Paul Henreid with sad eyes that virtually talk) with whom she begins a tentative acquaintance with that turns to love. Once home and deciding on an independent life away from her mother she takes on a younger version of herself, Tina, played poignantly by Janis Wilson, whom Charlotte learns is none other than Jerry's daughter. Nevertheless, Charlotte tutors Tina back to mental health, and even while she rejects the marriage of a certain convenience to Elliot Livingston (John Loder) since she cannot forget Jerry, she decides to remain independent despite of the hinted possibility of not fulfilling her affair with him at the end. The last scene, with Henreid and Davis gazing into each other's eyes as he lights up a cigarette for the both of them, and Davis' last line, Don't let's ask for the moon -- we have the stars, is cinematic romance at its finest.Irving Rapper, one of Hollywood's gay directors, could not have made a gayer film than this and my view is not controversial Hollywood did not allow overt films about homosexuality back then, unless the man was a fop and a much secondary character meant to be the butt of fag jokes. Writers and directors alike decided to somehow incorporate a gay element without making it clear off the bat and devised stories that were strongly symbolic in nature. And while Olivia Higgins Prouty's novel was not intended to be interpreted as such, her quoting of Walt Whitman's Now voyager, sail forth to seek and find is interesting when Whitman himself was homosexual. Plus, the added element of Charlotte Vale's damaged persona by her mother who forced her into total repression -- something very close to many gay men and women -- and her ultimate transformation into a complete person due to her inner strength has also been a recurring gay theme.But despite this view, the fact remains that NOW VOYAGER is a consummate woman's picture, a superior weepie that hasn't aged due to its themes of mental cruelty within family members and one person's quiet courage to take on the world and resume her own sense of identity despite years of baggage. Another version of parental abuse would re-surface as the Mexican drama LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE but aside from the mother-daughter relationship, the stories are completely different even in tone and cultural values.Bette Davis received another Oscar nod for her role here as did Gladys Cooper, but the entire cast lends good support, from Ilka Chase and Bonita Granville as Charlotte's cousins down to Mary Wickes in a small yet funny role as a nurse tending to a bed-ridden Cooper and being a small agent in allowing Davis' Vale to go on with her life.

(Jerry) Durrance, the married man she meets, befriends, and with whom she falls in love on a cruise following a transformative stay at the Vermont Sanatorium operated by Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains). Reviewers often speak of the themes of self-sacrifice and relate it to the war, which would have been an attractive reason to make the film, but the reality was that the novel was a popular best-seller, Higgins-Prouty's earlier novel, Stella Dallas, was also a popular film (and later a radio series), and the studio stood to do well financially if the movie turned out well. Hal Wallis' deft hand as producer is seen here, especially in his choice of Orry Kelly as costume designer for Bette Davis. He and the studio worked within the limits of censors' requirements, which indicated that there could be no intimation that the two main characters had sex (which was implicit in the novel but never explicitly stated, where the behavior between the two in the love scenes were generally glossed over most of the time), and that they could not share the same blanket in the scene where they are in a hut on a Brazilian mountain, stranded. They also had to change locales for the story, because the novel had the sea voyage set in and around Italy, Gibralter, etc. In spite of any restrictions placed on the filmmakers and actors, the film followed the novel very closely, especially with respect to dialogue. The big point of contention has always been who invented the two-cigarette lighting gesture that Paul Henreid became famous for later? According to some, George Brent and Bette Davis did something similar earlier in another film, and according to Paul Henreid and Bette Davis, there was a cigarette exchange ritual in the script which was sort of awkward, so they improvised based on Paul Henreid's experience with his wife on car trips. The latter seems likely, as there was a cigarette-exchange ritual in the novel (Jerry would give Charlotte a cigarette, lighting hers and then his own on one match, and then they would exchange cigarettes with each other so that Charlotte smoked the one that had been in Jerry's mouth and vice versa), which would have been slightly awkward in practice.All in all, this is a truly excellent film with great production values, true to the novel on which it was based, and a wonderful ensemble cast.

As Charlotte Vale, a rich Bostonian smothered by a mother who had her late in life, Davis plays a frumpy, low-esteemed, near recluse of a woman. That is, until her cousin intervenes by bringing a psychiatrist, Dr. Jacquith (Claude Rains) into Miss Vale's life.Miss Vale's cousin and shrink conspire to bring her out of the steel shell her domineering mother (Gladys Cooper) has encased her within. Their idea is to send her on a cruise with the doctor's advice to learn everything, do everything, engage everyone. The results are a remarkable transformation of a woman who believed she was an 'ugly duckling' into Miss Bette Davis as a sizzling hot beauty like she never was before or after in any other film.How Miss Davis didn't view herself as a beauty or use her beauty to create her success as an actress is what Now, Voyager, proves is most remarkable about her 66 year long acting career. If she had wanted to be a bombshell, she could have, two snaps up. Davis didn't want to be a movie star, or glamor girl. She wanted to be a great actor and achieved her life's goal. Not only did she make her career using acting skill and shrewd business finesse, Bette Davis also made quite a few other people's acting careers work well for them by taking a back seat in films with her role having a weaker script. Thus, as co-actors they could collaborate to make out of an average screenplay a screen hit and a new acting star. Davis was so unselfish an actor that she was in the acting business to benefit the art. That's why she's my favorite actor of all time she was so self-assured as an actor in a man's world (in the 20th century), that her ego didn't get in the way of making truly great movies with co-actors with whom she worked with as a team player. Now, Voyage, is one such film. Clearly, she steals the show, but she takes Paul Heinried (love interest, Jerry) right next to her, conjoined at the hip. What a delight it must have been to work with a true artist who was a great expert at her craft.Bogie & Bergman in Casablanca, don't have one thing over Davis & Heinreid in Now, Voyager, when it comes to the most intense, well acted, extremely well scripted romantic drama that has it all. Davis is glamorous beyond compare and Heinreid is a smooth, sensuous, suitor.This is my favorite of all of her motion pictures (at least I believe I own and have seen them all). How anyone could say that Bette Davis wasn't a raving beauty after they saw her in this film is beyond me. Not only does Jerry fall madly in love with Charlotte, so does audience after audience, generation after generation.There's much more to this great story, but I'm not telling! Buy the DVD.

I *love* Now Voyager. I don't love it as a guilty pleasure, or as camp, or as an example of film-making from the Golden Age of Hollywood. I don't love it as a soap opera or as example of the long lost genre, the theatrical-release, big budget, woman's picture. I love Now Voyager as a movie. Now Voyager's quality could stand comparison with any great film out there.Plot Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis), the psychologically abused child of a sadistic iceberg of a wealthy, Boston Brahmin mother (Gladys Cooper), thanks to the intervention of a compassionate sister-in-law (Ilka Chase) is packed off to a posh asylum, where Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains) restores her to well being.Charlotte loses weight, loses her glasses, and receives tutoring in how to dress and carry herself. Superficially quite the glamor puss, she goes on a cruise and charms Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) an unhappily married architect.Circumstance intervenes and Jerry and Charlotte enjoy a brief affair. As time goes on, they make some heart-wrenching decisions about how to handle their adulterous love; along the way, Charlotte forms an important bond with Tina, Jerry's daughter, whose mother does not love her.The screen is full of women's bodies, women's voices, women's choices, and women's lives. There are old women, middle aged women, and young women. There are good and bad women in every class. For example, while Tina is the sweet but unattractive and lost young woman, Bonita Granville, as June Vale, is a pretty, blonde, young b----. The scenes in which June, without censure from any quarter, uses her youth and prettiness to torment her pathetic spinster aunt are terrific, honest, and cruel.The plot is built around the issues of which women's lives are built their relationships with their mothers, or mother figures, both good and evil; how the world treats women based on how women look; women's competitions with, and support of, other women; what women do to survive economically and emotionally.The scenes between Charlotte and Tina are stunning in their sensuality. Tina, the daughter-surrogate, and Charlotte, the mother-figure, cling to each other in bed at night, and while sleeping under the stars on a camping trip; Tina sobs tears that wet her face; Charlotte strokes Tina's hair, and Tina clings to Charlotte's bosom.The simple message here is how incredibly important parenting is in the lives of both children and mothers, and how a person who has suffered -- Charlotte -- can often be a better person than those who have had it easier -- Mrs. Vale and June, and how having been handed a life that denies you love doesn't make it impossible for you to go out and find love on your own, to create your own family.Mrs. Vale is one of the most naked depictions of a child abusing mother ever committed to the screen. No, there are no graphic scenes of abuse, but the film never lets you believe that this woman is anything but a nightmare who damaged her child for life while the world let her get away with it because of her money.Again, the abuse is not graphic, but it is made certain. In one brilliant scene, Charlotte has returned to her mother's house after being out in the world and, for the first time in her life, experiencing some affection, joy, and confidence.Charlotte speaks in her new voice, a voice of self possession. But she is trying to be nice to her mother, and her voice quavers a bit, without losing its ground.Charlotte is out of camera range; we hear her, but do not see her. Her mother's back is to the camera. She is motionless -- except for her bejeweled, claw-like hand, which taps rhythmically against a carved bed post. One thinks of a cat waiting to pounce. One realizes that all that is going through Mrs. Vale's head is, How do I destroy her this time? That motion alone renders the scene both chilling and telling.Charlotte's love affair with Jerry Durrance is equally complex. This is no soap opera as some reviews here dismiss it as. Viewers are so caught up with Jerry's (Henreid's) trick of lighting two cigarettes at once that they miss the depth, power, and complexity of this relationship.Now Voyager gives us a terribly convincing portrait of two people who really love each other, and whose love is apparently doomed. Jerry is a superficially charming, nice guy whose unhappy marriage has given him reason to see beneath the surfaces of life; he's no rocket scientist, though, so he's not as smart as he could be. He is attracted to a superficially glamorous woman whose secret past as an ugly duckling and abused child gives her a hidden side. For both, society demands that they present a pleasant facade, but pain has caused them to develop in ways that many people never do. Their love is real.Jerry is deep enough to be attracted, but not deep enough to realize, as soon as he might, how much his acting on his attraction could potentially devastate Charlotte, a woman whose hold on her life is tenuous, at best.Whether their love can ever be realized, or whether it would continue to grow outside of the confines of an adulterous affair begun on a cruise ship and consummated after the most outlandish interventions of fate on a mountain road, is a question viewers can still debate to this day. What is clear is that this love is real, and its stakes are terribly high. Charlotte's whole life hangs in the balance here, no less so than a Scorcese hero's life hangs in the balance given how he handles his weapon.Claude Rains is solid as Charlotte's best hope at the beginning, and, perhaps, also at the end of the movie..

And yet, despite its soap opera origins, this is a work of beauty and artistry largely because of the magnificent lead performance by Bette Davis, but also because of Irving Rapper's sensitive direction and the first class production values. Even just twenty years later, the same material would come out as hopelessly camp (imagine, if you will, what would have happened if this had been shot in lurid 1959 Technicolor, starring Susan Hayward or, worse yet, Lana Turner). POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN PLOT SUMMARY Davis is Charlotte Vale, a repressed Boston spinster (MISS Charlotte Vale, as her hellish mother would sneer) under the complete control of her iron-fisted mother (Gladys Cooper in an unforgettable performance). With the aid of a renowned psychiatrist, Dr. Jacquith (Claude Rains), Charlotte transforms into a sophisticated-looking woman, but she remains insecure and shy. Jacquith sends her off on a restorative cruise to Brazil with an admonition from Walt Whitman Now, voyager...set ye forth to seek and find. What she finds is unconditional love in the form of a married man, Jerry (Paul Henreid), who is touched by Charlotte's plight and helps her to blossom even further. Knowing their love affair is impossible, Charlotte and Jerry vow to never see or speak to each other again once their vacation is over. At last having known what it is to love and be loved, Charlotte returns home and, for the first time, stands up to her mother and begins creating a new life for herself. Some time later, she accidentally meets Jerry's adolescent daughter Tina (the excellent Janis Wilson), who is the very picture of a 13-year-old, frightened, repressed Charlotte Vale. Charlotte then finds a new purpose in life helping Tina out of her shell, just as Jerry had helped Charlotte. END SUMMARY/SPOILERS. Clearly, the plot teetered dangerously close to bathos. And, in today's quest for realism, this film could never survive a contemporary telling. But the actors so believe in it, so does the audience. In spite of the properly lush Max Steiner score, in spite of the grand Hollywood style, in spite of the operatic silliness of some of the plot devices, the end result is never less than convincing. At the heart of it, of course, is Bette Davis, in perhaps her finest, most restrained performance ever. Never once does she ham it up; and the material practically invites overacting. Yes, the performances and dialogue are stylized, but this is what MOVIES are all about. It treads a fine line between fantasy and honesty; you never once forget that you're watching a movie (which is a high compliment in my book), and it's all so artfully done, you believe (wish?) that real life is truly like it. Even in 1942, that was a rare feat--and impossible today.

Help for Charlotte arrives in the person of Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), who suggests a different living environment, and eventually a new direction in life. Charlotte thus sets out on a voyage of discovery, or quest, to find herself and her potential for happiness and love.The film starts off Gothic, but gradually translates to a love story with lots of twists and turns. The underlying premise is sound, but the plot is overwrought, drawn out, and talky. Small sections of the film's middle section could have been expunged, to tighten the plot. And the dialogue could have been reduced in places, which would have rendered a film of even greater impact. Nevertheless, the film still tells a great story.The B&W cinematography ranges from good to excellent. In one scene, special effects create an image wherein Charlotte's eyes overlap her mother's face. It is a visually stunning image, and it wonderfully captures the film's timeless theme, the painful process whereby a grown child must confront an overbearing parent, if that child is to grow and gain adult independence.The film's costumes are interesting. And Max Steiner's original score adds emotional texture to the story. But it is the acting that really makes this film a classic. Except for her work in All About Eve, Bette Davis gives as good a performance here as in any film of hers that I have seen. Claude Rains and Paul Henreid are good in support roles. And the never smiling Gladys Cooper is stunningly effective as the matron saint of outdated Victorian Puritanism.Despite its cryptic title, taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, this film presents viewers with a story that most people can identify with, in one way or another. Now, Voyager transcends its hyperbolic working script, and compels attention through its cinematography, its music, and especially the acting of Gladys Cooper and Bette Davis.

It is my favorite Bette Davis film, as it exemplifies her classic '40s persona; initially fragile but ready to bloom, she, is, ultimately, a survivor who, facing her destiny, embraces it with courage and confidence.It's hard to believe that Davis, Warner's biggest female star, had to fight for the role of Charlotte Vale, but Olive Higgins Prouty's best-selling novel was such a strong potential star vehicle that a wide array of actresses, from Irene Dunne to Ginger Rogers, campaigned for the part. Davis was undaunted, however, and after meetings with producer Hal Wallis, succeeded in winning him over, then pressured the studio into borrowing Paul Henreid from RKO, as her leading man. The potent chemistry between the pair is a highlight of the film; who can forget the scenes of his lighting two cigarettes in his mouth, then handing one to Bette? As brilliant as her performance is (earning her an Oscar nomination), the rest of the cast is equally good. Headed by Oscar nominee Gladys Cooper, as her selfish, dominating mother, and Claude Rains, as the brilliant, yet down-to-earth psychiatrist who turns the frumpy Vale into a radiant beauty, the characters mesh together seamlessly. Two supporting characters deserve special attention; Janis Wilson, as Henreid's love-starved daughter, succeeds as a younger variation of Davis; and young Mary Wickes, great fun as a plain-speaking, wise nurse, unafraid of the Dowager mother.This is a film to cherish, from director Irving Rapper's masterful use of voice-over 'thoughts' of Vale, to Max Steiner's famous, wildly romantic score.While Now, Voyager is, unabashedly, a 'Chick Flick', don't be surprised, female viewers, if the guy in your life becomes as big a fan of the film as you...Davis is the kind of heroine EVERYONE can cheer for!

Charlotte (Bette Davis), at the start, is completely unrecognizable as the ugly duckling. You really have to feel for her &#150; cooped up in that house, her Mother telling her what to read, who to see, what to do.

After Charlotte goes back to the sanitarium (were Charlotte originally found mental stability and helped get her out of her shell), she meets Jerry's daughter and befriends her. Charlotte knows exactly how she feels and they share a bond. Watching them run around and do different activities warms your heart.Now, Voyager is a movie that shows you many emotions hope, joy, sadness, freedom, love, happiness, sorrow, frustration&#133; and you will experience these as you watch this movie. It's a brilliant, beautiful movie &#150; heck, I'm 14 and I loved it! I recommend it &#150; for ANYONE &#150; because we can ALL relate.

Bette was in her prime in 1942, and together with  the supporting  cast given to her, made this such a success.  Claude Rains, of course, did a sterling job as her Doctor, while Paul Henreid had one of his better Warner Brothers' roles.  It was interesting to see Bonita Granville in a sympathetic (eventually!) part at long last, but for me it was a very interesting film, which today would be called a soapie and tear-jerker (which it was then!).

Now voyager has Bette Davis as a convincing lead role, to add to this she wears very little make up for the first few scenes and transforms. This film entails a classic love story, which doesn't need to include sex or a steamy affair. But it portrays classic romance when sexual etiquette was still alive. Also it shows a touching relationship between Bette and her child co star, she helps the girl overcome a deep family depression. However the classic moment in the film is when her lover lights two cigarettes and passes one to Bette. Lovely!

You vicariously felt the characters pain.I would recommend this movie to anyone who struggles with low self-esteem and self-doubt. No matter what trauma or bad experience you have had, you can still be the person you want to be when you receive Love and friendship. Just as Charlotte Vale found a sense of belonging in helping Jerry's daughter, we all can find permanence when we show compassion to distressed people.I am finding out more of the prodigious talents that Max Steiner possessed. The musical score in this movie was outstanding.

Most people seeing this say it is a woman's movie.The lead is female. The problems are those associated with women marriage, relationships, loneliness, and love. Those who don't like the movie, say it leaves out half the human race.Nonsense.The film introduces us to a maiden aunt who is overweight, plain and very self conscious with glasses that, in her opinion, does nothing for her. It is the custom of her family to either bully her (her mother and her niece), or to show a silent sort of pity. Only June is determined to do something she introduces Charlotte to Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains) who immediately understands her condition. To her credit, so does Charlotte. She knows she needs help, or at least a change.With his excellent guidance, she is transformed into a beautiful engaging woman. She decides to go on a ship's cruise to fulfill an unspoken need. She meets Jerry (Paul Hanreid), with whom she immediately falls in love. He returns it. But (as we learn later), he is married, but is very unhappy. His wife is not a partner she's an emotional leach. He is a noble man and will not divorce her to marry Charlotte.Charlotte respects his nobility she will not be a home wrecker. They part. Charlotte decides to try developing a relationship based on comfort. Eventually she realizes it is not for her, that she cannot settle for a little when she has had a love like the one she's had with Jerry.She gets into an argument with her mother and her mother cannot stand the strain of the argument and has a fatal heart attack. She cannot stand her guilt and goes back for help from Dr. Jaquith. There she meets Jerry's daughter Tina. She immediately takes a liking to the girl. They become like mother and daughter, both fulfilling the needs of the other.Jerry is eternally grateful and decides Tina is in the right place.That essentially is the plot. But the plot description really pales the dialog, the delivery, the music, the direction, and the sincerity of the production. With a 50% divorce rate, we cannot understand much of what happens in the film. We would likely think the nobility is another word for stupidity. We would think her timidity laughable we are encouraged to make our way in the world.And yet don't we all wish we could love someone with the unwavering feminine moral standard of Charlotte? She had the power to corrupt Jerry, but did not. Don't we all wish we knew someone like Jerry who had plenty of opportunity to stray, but did not?How we watch one of those films determines what our response is going to be. If we are cynical, we will probably laugh. If we are emotional, we likely will get teary eyed. If we know what we are watching we will enjoy and be enriched by a film that transcends all its surface defects. 10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"The One With the Two Cigarettes Lit by the Man at the Same Time","Date":"25 June 2006","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" This may be the best soap opera love film from Hollywood in it's golden age - it certainly is among them, and it certainly is Bette Davis' best soap opera role Charlotte Vale. From neurotic, overweight recluse to sophisticated traveler, to surrogate mother of the daughter of the man she loves but can't have. It is 1942, and divorce is still a sticky matter.Davis always denied that, eventually, her character and Jerry Durrance (Paul Henried) would have married (presumably when his daughter Tina would grow up). She insisted that she and Dr. Jacquith (Claude Rains) would have married. If so it would probably been a friendly marriage - not a sexually based one. I suppose her guess was based on her involvement with Jacquith's country rest home (they are planning a whole new wing she's financing at the end of the film). Certainly she is getting involved, and Jacquith does look at her in a slightly different way just before the end of the film. But Jacquith has never even shown anything but a doctor's interest in Charlotte in the film - it has blossomed into a friendship though.The film has many lovely moments in it - some quite funny actually. The car wreck in Brazil with Giuseppi, the taxi driver who barely speaks English (Banana trees is one of his phrases) is amusing. Even the autocratic Mrs. Vale (Dame Gladys Cooper) makes some cracks that are funny (her comparison of people to flowers for example). Cooper's autocratic old line female Brahman is a wonderful acting job, nearly stealing the movie from Davis and Rains at times. It earned her an Oscar nomination. And Bonita Granville certainly does a nice job as Charlotte's niece, who likes to tease her (apparently a family habit), but eventually realizes that Charlotte is as normal as she is.Any film with a title based on a Walt Whitman quote must be good. If you have never seen this one, see it soon.

That it is, but I think the reason for its continuing popularity and that it's almost always listed in Bette Davis's top five by any of her fans is that it shows her growth as a human being over the course of the film.It's not that they ugly Davis up in makeup when we first meet her as spinster Charlotte Vale. Some costuming and maybe some padding, but the rest is her ability as a performer. She was a daughter born late in life to mother Gladys Cooper who hadn't expected, hadn't wanted her. My guess is that she felt after having three sons, Cooper expected to be a full time society grand dame and the new baby cramped her style. In any event Davis grows up totally under Cooper's thumb as an unloved spinster.A wise and perceptive sister-in-law in the person of Ilka Chase has her meet psychiatrist Claude Rains who sees a breakdown coming. She spends some time in his sanitarium and under his tutelage, Davis emerges from her shell. She even takes an ocean cruise where the new and attractive Davis meets the unhappily married Paul Henreid and they have an affair.It's unfortunate that war time restrictions being what they were that the only recreation of Brazil, specifically Rio De Janeiro is on the Warner Brothers back lot. Still with newsreel establishing shots, director Irving Rapper does bring it off.When she returns home Davis is in a whole new dimension of a relationship with Cooper and the rest of her family and friends. She even meets Henreid's daughter whose own mother has turned her into a creature like Davis used to be.My favorite part of Now Voyager has always been Bette's scenes with young Janis Wilson. They are beautifully played the new swan trying to bring another ugly duckling to crack the shell. I think more than the romance they were responsible for getting Bette an Oscar nomination.Gladys Cooper got one also in the Supporting Actress category. Unfortunately both Davis and Cooper ran into actresses from Mrs. Miniver that year who won in the persons of Greer Garson and Teresa Wright. However Max Steiner's musical score, one of his best, took home Now Voyager's only Oscar.Other people to note in the cast are John Loder as a man entranced by Bette's blossoming who offers to marry her and Mary Wickes who plays a most practical nurse for Gladys Cooper. After dealing with Monty Woolley in The Man Who Came To Dinner, I think Wickes was ready for anything.I also think that Now Voyager's message of how love can come to anyone has made this film a timeless classic. In fact that same moon and stars are still there that Davis and Henreid talked about. And the film will be as popular as long as they are there.

It exactly captures the tone of the book, condenses and streamlines the plot without violating it, and takes most of its dialogue directly from Prouty's well-written romance. All in a first class, sumptuously produced film of just the right length.This is probably the best pictureization (to use an archaic word) of a novel I have ever seen. The novel gives clearer motivation for the shipboard romance, which is only hinted at in the film, but that can be overlooked. In the novel, Jerry, or J. D., has also suffered a nervous breakdown, so he can understand Charlotte's difficulty from first hand experience.Everything about this film is just right. This was a best selling book in 1941 and no wonder the film received such a rapturous reception the following year! In addition, Davis gives probably the best performance of her long career here, understanding the character and really liking her, playing in the moment in every scene, and making the transformation from frumpy librarian (as a friend once described the pre-breakdown Charlotte) to glowing swan entirely believable. You end the picture cheering for her!

If there weren't heavy attendance during that particular day or night, I suppose this was true. Now, I've discovered that to be able to see the same movies in the privacy of my home, gives me the freedom to openly sob and become a total idiot if the film evokes that emotion in me. Yes, I saw Now, Voyager in a theater when it was released; that was long before television was an absolute must in every room of every home.....how spoiled we've become, providing our children with all these marvelous instruments, allowing them to watch whatever they choose, usually. BUT, we wonder how our children become totally unknown to us; could it be they are missing the experience of families who do things together, simply because they can't afford to give junior his own TV? Left alone, he/she forms opinions and callous reactions without the benefit of asking another of their opinion or please explain.......Now, Voyager needs no explanation - it's all there for all to see. What many viewers have missed is the tyrannical nature Mama Vale has assumed by replacing a tyrannical father. Very few fathers in pre-modern eras have been buddies to their children let's talk about this; no such deal. They were masters of their own houses and there was only one viewpoint theirs. If daddy was a good man, can't say much against their rearing of their kids. Rebellion is a characteristic in most kids; when they become parents, they may not want to subject their kids to a repressive parent. Yet, being overly generous without proper guidance often produces children to become total strangers. So, when junior marches-off to join the terrorists in Iraq or my little girl leans more toward being openly promiscuous, we can't merely say Oh, they're just kids. Bull ! Adolescent kids are not nearly as innocent as we want to perceive....they are well on their way to how they'll live their adult lives.That the explosive Bette Davis could do this role with such sweet reserve is truly a revelation. Contrived or not, she reveals it IS possible to find oneself through difficulty - the early part of the film clearly demonstrates she was a normal individual. Mama Vale was just a meanie. I didn't read one commentary on the brilliance between Ms. Davis and Mr. Henreid in the scene on the Back Bay railroad-platform - Back Bay was a snotty place ! Charlotte sailed through the difficult scenes with Mama, realizing she truly had become able to say I'm not afraid......Ms. Davis seldom gave such calmly convincing acting. All that Tina business became bearable simply because she continued to act through-out the remainder of the movie. Claude Rains was formidable - the other characters were true-to-life, the nurse absolutely lovable. Could John Loder be the same actor who scared the poop out of me in The Lodger ? Now, Voyager demonstrates all is not democratic amongst people who vote for the awards. After all, they are humans with their egos pumped-up to the verge of narcissism. Ms. Davis had the courage to fight them all; it has been noted the director of the film was gay. Can't you envision Ms. Davis saying, Listen, Sissy - one word from me.... ? I absolutely believe she directed herself. I also believe any actor/actress who needs constant direction - having no inner-vision how a scene should be played - should seriously consider another occupation. The tragedy of MM's psychoses should be a road-map of how changing an exotic dancer into box-office property helps no one...and they're STILL trying to discover whom she was.Is there an American actress, today, who could portray Charlotte Vale as Bette Davis did? Absolutely not - they may do a good imitation of her brilliance, but it still wouldn't be the original. A re-make - impossible! How miserably they fail, because modern actors/actresses - with the exception of Streep - try to deliver naturalness, when we're screaming for theatrical escape. Our own lives are soap-operas.....Indeed! Now, Voyager was robbed of its acclaim. Most people are viewing these movies (for the first time) because the studios are releasing albums of their work. Their greed in pricing ensures we ARE going to buy pirated copies. How shocking it must be to young viewers to see, graphically, acting has nothing to do with blow-em-up violence. Take us back to the era when simple stories deliver us from the trauma of daily life - give us movies to renew our belief there is good in all this craziness we live in now.

Without giving out any more details of the plotline, just know that Davis herself received literally hundreds of letters from women who suffered Charlotte's dilemma. As Dr. Jacquith, the kindly, wise and compassionate head of a haven of hope named Cascade, Claude Rains is more subtle than usual, but his performance is honest and assured.  Viewers have mixed reactions to Janis Wilson as Tina some think she's terrific, others find her annoying. I think she's somewhere in between! As the aristocratic Back Bay matriarch Mrs. Vale, Gladys Cooper does a really magnificent job her failure to deliver a Bostonian accent and too heavy make-up can be forgiven. As June, Charlotte's spunky, impudent neice, Bonita Granville was well cast (Davis herself commented that Granville struck her as gossipy and flighty during the production).  Paul Henreid's original screen test horrified Davis. Shown with slicked-with-brilliantined hair, his acting technique stiff and awkward, Davis pleaded to the producers to make the character of Jerry more natural and less continental.  As Charlotte, the film's unlikely heroine, Davis runs the gamut from A-Z truly a showcase for the most actressy of all movie stars, Ms Vale's inward journey from a sad, pathetically withdrawn ugly duckling to a self-confidently independent swan is a screen classic.

Overall, the film avoids the traps of slushy sentimentality on the one hand, and clinical case study on the other, to stay on course as an absorbing, touching, literate drama. Balance and moderation also apply to the way the plot develops and the characters behave. The breach between Charlotte and her domineering mother (an icy Gladys Cooper), which seems likely at one point, is avoided. Charlotte steps back from a loveless marriage to a kind but dull socialite; and fulfils her maternal longings by looking after the unhappy daughter of her true love, Jerry Durrance (a suave but vulnerable Paul Henreid). And, in the final scene, Charlotte and Jerry famously choose not to ask for the moon of a permanent relationship, but settle for the stars of their brief but passionate affair in Rio. Our response to the movie is also balanced; the tears we shed for the couple's lost happiness are compensated for by our admiration for their self-denial and for Charlotte's new-found independence of mind. But I am left wondering whether all this bitter-sweet reasonableness and compromise is what the doctor (Claude Rains as an avuncular psychiatrist) really ordered. And I certainly doubt if it would have impressed free-spirited Walt Whitman, who wrote the lines from which the film's title is taken. I wouldn't mind seeing an alternate ending where a bolder, but still balanced, Charlotte asked for both the moon and the stars!

Davis is Charlotte Vale, a spinster aunt from one of Boston's oldest and most prestigious families, who has been confined to a life of seclusion by a demonstrative matriarch (Gladys Cooper). By the time concerned relative, Lisa (Ilka Chase) intervenes with the congenial Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), Charlotte is primed for a nervous breakdown. On Jaquith's orders, Charlotte begins her psychological metamorphosis at a plush sanitarium in the country. However, when the newly renovated Charlotte is sent on a cruise as part of her therapy, she meets debonair man about town, Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) under an assumed name, and quite easily falls in love with him. One problem &#150; Jerry is married. However, as the two draw closer they realize that fate has united them in personal tragedy and misery. Both are forever bonded in their love of Jerry's daughter, Justine (Hilda Plowright), in whom Charlotte sees shades of her former self. The film is justly remembered for its melodic score by Max Steiner, and for the romantic pas deux in which Jerry lights two cigarettes at once and offers one to Charlotte in a moment of distress.Paul Henreid was perhaps most aptly put to good use in this film as a romantic lead. The chemistry between him and Davis is palpable and engaging. Never afraid to take artistic chances, Davis launches into her performance as the uni-browed spinster with gusto. Her transformation is as elevating of the human spirit as it is startling, the first time we see her &#150; sans frumpy clothes and Amish hairdo. Truly, this is one film I always have trouble getting through without tears in my eyes. Now Voyager is melodrama of the highest order &#150; a brilliant bit of film making that will leave you with a lump in your throat and warmth of heart.

What makes us ignore the flaws derived from this very sort of the perceptions such content evokes is the artistry at multiple levels, Hollywood's most powerful tool of illusion and magnetism, the film is thoroughly supplied with.First and foremost, this artistry resides in the performances. Bette Davis convincingly portrays a character who undergoes, I can allow myself this word, metamorphosis. From being a person who is 'alone in all ways,' she depicts a change prompted and wonderfully motivated by Dr Jasquith (Claude Rains). Although this 'metamorphosis' may occur banal due to diminishing a human to mere looks, fashionable clothes and sentimental exclamation of being content with stars...not asking for the moon, her moments are played with ease and the desirable insight necessary in the role of that sort. She does not make her character laughable and, at the same time, instills sufficient amount of tear jerking euphoria. From the sentimental introduction of her character with the drops of rain behind the window to the moonlit moments of romance constitute a thoroughly convincing depiction.Her leading men, Claude Rains and Paul Henreid, differ considerably and, yet, create vibrant characters of lasting significance. The versatile actor, Claude Rains, skillfully portrays the psychological essence of the movie (1942 was too early to talk about psychoanalyzing characters and yet, we can find certain tendencies). He is, consequently, easily identified with and very likable. The romantic looking actor Paul Henreid, though not placed in sheer rivalry against Rains' character as it is the case of DECEPTION, is again provided with European flair. The much appraised scene of the two (Bette and Paul) lighting a cigarette echoes the never ending power of illusion within the same spirits but different methods of Hollywood.Among the supporting cast, a mention must be made of Gladys Cooper who portrays the villainous manipulative mother - someone who could equally display a powerful insight under Hitchcock's guidance. Nominated for the Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, Ms Cooper delivers a tremendous portrayal of a domineering personality. In one scene, thanks to the gorgeous camera-work, we see the back of her hand encompassing the foreground of the screen frame while Bette Davis' character remains in the background. One of the milestone 'evil incarnates' on screen with the overtone of critical approach towards cruel family ties, of course.The artistry's triumph also lies in the entire visual subtlety of the movie &#x96; all is neat and elegant. Since some viewers consider this film to be a woman's picture or a 'weenie,' these interiors almost heaped with decorations of highest caliber. Apart from some public events' scenes, consider the Rio sequence which cleverly combines charm with humor and incorporates a variety of elements that result in truly aesthetic viewing experience.In that relation, there is a need to give full credit to Max Steiner for his fabulous music score filled with dynamic tensions and powerful parallels with characters' feelings. Reminiscing certain classical pieces moderated and adapted to the cinematic needs (just to name Tschaikovsky), he deservedly won the award.To sum up, it is undeniably one of the most 'artistic' novellas on screen where you not only have Bette Davis' eyes but display of powerful performances, stunning cinematography, memorable score and direction of great caliber. One of those precious products of old Hollywood that is no more. Worth seeking and finding.

Ms. Davis executes a flawless transition of her character Charlotte Vale from insecure, ugly spinster to beautiful, independent loving woman. I root for Charlotte and want the best for her. She handles the battle with her cruel Mom thanks to the help of two men. Paul Henreid and Claude Rains effectively support Charlotte as the love interest and therapist respectively.Rains Dr. Jaquith, provides the sanity for Charlotte to find herself. He shows trust in her that unfortunately cannot be shown today. Can you imagine a Dr. allowing a patient to take home another patient, a minor to live with her? Dr. Jaquith trusts Charlotte and lets take home Jerry Durrance's neglected daughter home.The plot poignantly deals with the two unwanted girls in Jerry's life. First, he truly loves Charlotte and she him but because he is married even though unhappily both have the character to respect his marriage. Then there is his daughter Tina whom his wife detests, like Charlotte's Mom detested her. After Charlotte recommends Dr. Jaquith to him, Jerry takes Tina there to find help but Tina does not have the success that Charlotte had until Charlotte meets her and goes out of her way to help her.Charlotte so loves Jerry that she sacrifices and makes Tina her daughter with Jerry. Charlotte makes her home Jerry's and Tina's home too. Although, she can never have Jerry completely, she brings love to Tina that Jerry's wife never had for Tina.I wish we had movies like this one today. Ms. Davis was a phenomenal actress.

What does the child become? Is it possible to believe you are deserving of any love if you weren't deserving of the love of your mother? When the child becomes adult and goes out into the world, how does she survive?Answer she doesn't. She hates herself. Treats herself as undeserving. Lets herself get pushed around. Doesn't believe that anyone could ever love her. She hides from the world. Suffers a nervous breakdown.Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is born of a selfish, cruel, and heartless mother. Gladys Cooper as the mother is so realistically vicious, I felt my own psyche deflate with her verbal abuse. In her eyes, the daughter is not a human being &#x96; she is a servant, a slave, not permitted to have her own feelings or thoughts, and beholden to the mother for bringing her into the world despite the fact that she was unwanted. A compassionate psychologist (Claude Rains) comes into Charlotte's life and she learns that she is indeed human, deserving, and can think for herself. She begins to come alive. She becomes physically transformed. A man (Paul Henreid) admires her beauty and desires to know her. They fall in love. Because of that love, she becomes whole, confident, and treats herself in a self-respecting way. She stands up to the mother and discovers that she is no longer scared (of living). Their love also buoys the man's confidence so he can pursue his own dream career.Despite circumstances which keep them from marrying or expressing their love publicly, they find a way to build and keep their love. She sees in his daughter the unloved child that she once was (unloved by a selfish and jealous mother). More than anyone else and because she knows the precise ache of this girl's pain, Charlotte is able to give this emotionally starved child what she needs love, acceptance, attention. In helping his daughter, she can become his partner. His daughter becomes THEIR daughter. She creates her own version of a family that might not be satisfying to someone else or even socially acceptable but it makes HER happy. She is now woman who chooses for herself.This is a soft and feminine performance by Bette Davis. Unlike many of her other performances where she charges like a bull through the dialogue and body language, she steps more lightly and gently through this role as a vulnerable woman coming into herself. I like her as this full-fledged human being with depth (rather than a conniver, a powerhouse, a manipulator, a queen). In this performance, Bette Davis exhales, and its nice to watch.

Said Doctor invites Charlotte to his sanatorium where she finally begins to get a sense of self. The Doctor, satisfied with Charlotte's progress, encourages her to embark on a long cruise where she meets a married man, Jerry Durrance, (Paul Henreid), and becomes involved in a doomed love affair. Upon her return home, Charlotte is able to deal with her mother, but eventually feels the need to return to the sanitarium when things turn tragic. At the sanatorium she meets Jerry's youngest daughter and believes she can help her because their two situations are/were so similar.Recommendations This film works beautifully due to the considerable talent involved. First, there is the haunting score by Max Steiner, (if real-life doomed lover affairs had a soundtrack, they would sound like this), as well as the absolutely brilliant performances delivered by Bette Davis and Gladys Cooper as mother and daughter, (I could watch these two for hours). Second, Claude Rains, Ilka Chase and Paul Henreid lend strong support in their respective roles.

Director Irving Rapper's classic black & white romantic melodrama represents a splendid example of a movie whose theme is women versus women. Women make more trouble for women in this soap operatic saga. A young, impressionable woman named Charlotte Vale suffers under the relentless tyranny of her misguided mother Mrs. Henry Vale who has planned Charlotte's very move, right now to marriage to the man appropriate to her social station in life. Charlotte is withering away under her mother's dictatorial foot when salvation arrives in the person of a pipe-smoking Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains of Casablanca) who convinces Charlotte's mother to allow him to treat her at his sanitarium. Mrs. Vale relents and allows Jaquith to take Charlotte into his care. Surprising enough, Charlotte erupts from a cocoon of deprivation and blossoms into a young woman. Against Mrs. Vale's wishes, Charlotte is allowed to board a cruise ship and experience life. She becomes the toast of the cruise ship and meets a lonely husband, Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid of Casablanca), and the two of them become lifelong friends. At one point during the cruise, Charlotte and Jerry smoke cigarettes. This scene supposedly started a practice for the man to light both cigarettes and hand one to the woman.

Now, Voyager stars Bette Davis, Paul Henreid, and Claude Rains, in a dramatic picture that produced well deserved Oscar Nominations for both Bette Davis (leading role) and Gladys Cooper (supporting role). Although the film struggles slightly to grab the viewers attention at the beginning, or more so at the middle, the film definitely justifies that lapse as the film progresses. A truly wonderful film, including Max Steiner's musical notes, showing that everyone is absolutely beautiful in one way or another.As the picture opens, Bette Davis (Charlotte Vale) is under severe strain from her mother (played by Gladys Cooper), who controls everything she does, from what she reads, to what she wears. Ugly Charlotte keeps herself in solitude, and is at the point of a nervous breakdown when Dr. Jaquith (played by Claude Rains) is introduced to her by Lisa Vale (played by Ilka Chase). Dr. Jaquith insists on taking Charlotte to his sanitarium, where she undergoes dramatic change. She is completely transfigured from her shy, ugly self, into a beautiful, confident woman. She soon heads off to South America, where she meets and falls in love with already married Jerry Durance (played by Paul Henreid). The film starts to bog down slightly here, but soon picks up when Charlotte goes back home.Her mother soon dies from a heart attack during a slight argument with Charlotte, leaving Charlotte with the family's wealth. Charlotte, guilty that she caused her mother's death, goes back to Dr. Jaquith's sanitarium, where she meets Tina, Jerry's rejected daughter (Although Jerry loved Tina very much). The film continues, wonderfully ending with Bette Davis's memorable quoteOh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars.

At the start of the film, her acting really shines as she plays the depressed Charlotte. Bette Davis probably deserves a lot more Oscars than she ever received. Paul Henreid's role may not have been as dramatic as Bette's, but carried out his acting in his usual, natural style.Claude Rains is, well Claude Rains. There is not one film that I can think of, that he didn't shine in. He played his role to perfection, being his usual joking, yet serious self. Definitely one of my favorite actors.Now, Voyager clearly has its placed among classic cinema. The only film I think of that is even slightly similar is Enchanted Cottage, which I was never quite able to get through. (oops, bad me).

Henreid is so charming in this one, and the way he does the two cigarette trick will make any woman fall in love with him. Claude Rains plays Davis' psychiatrist who brings her out of her shell and away from her domineering mother (played brilliantly by Gladys Cooper- Mrs Vale is truly a monster), and his performance is as quiet as ever, yet he is vital to the success of the film.

His excellent performance as the psychiatrist looks forward to Herbert Lom in THE SEVENTH VEIL and, best of them all, Leo Genn in THE SNAKE PIT.We believe in the melodrama, the rushing emotions, the big close-ups, because we believe in the sincerity of these performers, particularly Davis and Henreid.

At the time Rapper probably won brownie points for the before-and-after complementary shots of Charlotte's (Bette Davis) feet; first, in our initial introduction to her, they are clad in 'sensible' shoes and she is soon revealed in a dowwdy 'spinster' dress which tells us all we need to know about her character; later, after a lightning transformation at the hands and in the clinic of Claude Rains Rapper gives us another shot of her feet, descending a staircase on a cruise liner and this time they are encased in fashionable pumps just as she herself, when we see her a moment later, is dressed in the height of sophistication. This whole business is accomplished in little more than two reels or twenty minutes or so of screen time and though it would have been difficult to actually show the miraculous treatment she received it would also, especially when seen today, sixty years later, have given a little more credibility to a plot whose target audience is the average Redbook reader. Like most films of the period (it was released in 1942) it was 'meaty', plot-heavy with lots of opportunities for a large supporting cast, notably the ever reliable Mary Wickes, to shine. It's the kind of film that could have ended at several points -Charlotte's triumphant homecoming for example - but keeps on extracting extra mileage. If we feel today slightly cheated by the omission of the treatment in the clinic this also applies to the huge potential of the clash of personalities between the born-again Charlotte and her mother the cold, ruthless martinet, played to a fare-thee-well by Gladys Cooper, but with other, more romantic fish to fry, Cooper is killed off after just one exchange of caustic dialogue which promises an interesting power-struggle it fails to deliver. We need look no further than Charlotte Vale and her mother for Terence Rattigan's models for Sybil Railton-Bell and HER domineering mother in 'Separate Tables'. Perhaps best remembered for the 'two-cigarette trick, where Paul Henreid places two cigarettes in his mouth, lights them both then gives one to Davis, this is yet another outstanding example of Hollywood's Golden Age and distributors are to be applauded for issuing a Boxed Set of Four Davis movies with not one dog amongst them - for the record these are The letter, Now, Voyager, Dark Victory and Mr Skeffington, a real bargain in any currency.

One being Paul Henreid's lighting of two cigarettes and the other being Davis' speech which is a genuine tear-jerker. The ugly-duckling-turned-into-a-swan theme is a potentially hackneyed one but Now, Voyager is one of those rarities that does something truly special with it. Henreid is the personification of suave, Gladys Cooper is outstandingly formidable as the annoying over-bearing mother figure and Claude Rains, one of those rare actors who I've never seen a bad performance from, is beautifully sympathetic. The two best things about Now, Voyager are Bette Davis and Max Steiner's score. Davis is just fantastic in one of her greatest performances, a very close second to her iconic performance in All About Eve, she's never looked lovelier too. And Steiner's score is haunting, swells with emotion and romance and sounds in places almost symphonic, it's quite possibly his best score and Steiner penned some great ones. To conclude, a brilliant classic film that has nothing ugly about it, not even Janis Wilson's oft-criticised performance as Tina(which while she does overdo it a little I didn't have a problem with personally, there was a lot of heart to her role). 10/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Inspiring, intriguing","Date":"9 August 2009","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Bette Davis plays a homely, insecure woman in this film who struggles to overcome the influence of her domineering mother.

It is inspiring to watch Charlotte's transformation into a confident, popular and attractive woman, but also intriguing to see how she handles unexpected conflicts and uncertainties along the way.

It's a classic piece of grand, romantic storytelling--and yet with an ending that isn't quite so rosy. Charlotte's dreams are not completely delivered to her, but she has fulfillment within. It's a gusty soaper, yes, and it does take its time getting started; however, director Irving Rapper turns out to be shrewd with his pacing, and the screenplay digs a bit deeper than most genre films of this era.

Enter one Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains)to represent a calm voice in a sea of angst, to take Charlotte away to Cascades, a country sanatorium, to help her develop her spine and begin to discover who she is. Before going back home, a ship voyage is arranged during which the remainder of Charlotte's blossoming is completed and she falls in love with a fellow passenger, Jerry,(Paul Henreid). Jerry is unhappily married making any proper relationship impossible and they both swear off. Thus begins a long-distance relationship, roping in his unsuspecting and under loved youngest daughter.Original consumation of their relationship is cemented on the final leg of their trip in Brazil. Subsequent consumation is cemented when they simultaneously take a drag off their respective cigarettes and exhale the smoke in each other's faces at peak emotional, self-sacrificing moments.While I sound flippant about this implausible tale, it it the definitive Bette Davis playing against type.

All I can say is what a little gem of a movie. I am not normally the love story type of person, but this film made me reach for the Kleenex box on more than one occasion. Bette Davis was superb as the repressed Charlotte Vale living with an overbearing mother, (Gladys Cooper at her nasty best) slowly being driven toward a nervous breakdown. Enter a kindly psychiatrist Dr Jaquith (Claude Rains)who teaches the unhappy Charlotte that life is for living and sets her off on a voyage of self-discovery. Charlotte falls in love of course, with the handsome Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) but he is unhappily married so all they can have is a gentle love affair that will surely break both their hearts. However it is Charlotte's love for Jerry that enables her to defy her mother and make a life for herself outside of the family home. Even though she and Jerry can't be together, Charlotte can help Jerry's trouble daughter Tina who has suffered the same fate as Charlotte, being a child her mother does not want. There are many memorable scenes, everyone remembers Jerry lighting two cigarettes at the same time and the words Don't ask for the moon we have the stars but my favorite scene is Charlotte remembering her youth and a rare boat trip with her mother when she falls in love for the first time, and that love is reciprocated. The young actor (I can't remember his name) who plays that brief love interest bought tears to my eyes, as did the innocent quality of Charlotte's love as her blossoming passion for this young man is crushed beneath her mother's cruel reign. Now Voyager is one of those films you can watch again and again, and the soundtrack is equally as addictive.

A doctor (Claude Rains) is able to cure the young woman who goes on to find romance with an unhappy married man (Paul Henreid) but this relationship threatens to hurt the woman's mental state. This classic drama from Warner certainly deserves its reputation as one of the best soap operas out there and most of this is due to the tremendous cast who do a terrific job in the acting department. The Oscar winning score, great cinematography and some memorable locations just add to the pleasure. There's no question that this film belongs to Davis and she marvelously transforms from the ugly duckling to the princess. This film takes its time in the transformation, which is a good thing because it's an ongoing situations from start to finish. Davis really digs deep and delivers an incredibly strong character and it's a real treat seeing her transform from the early parts of the film to the end. The way Davis makes the early version look so ugly is quite remarkable as is the strong-headed nature to the second half character. The film also gets a lot out of the supporting characters with Henreid also delivering a very troubled character but one different than that of Davis. Rains is pitch-perfect in his small role as is Cooper who has to be considered one of the best villains in film history. The coldness she brings this mother character certainly makes ones blood boil. Bonita Granville, from the studios Nancy Drew series, also has a small role here. I think the film's main problem is how predictable it is in terms of a twist that comes at the end. Outside of this and a few dragging spots, this is a classic film that is a must see due to the terrific cast.

It's actually a ridiculous movie, but who the hell cares! The plot makes no sense, but the film seems to know its plot makes no sense and charges forward anyway. Of her noble sufferer roles, this was Davis's best, and she never disappoints. She has tremendous chemistry with Claude Rains, and the funniest moment in the film comes when he, as her doctor, talking to her about her time in a mental institution, says, I thought you came here to have a breakdown, (or something to that effect), and she replies, I did, but I changed my mind. Gladys Cooper plays Davis's stifling, overbearing battle-axe of a mother, a role Cooper cornered the market on. And director Irving Pichel throws in some nice directorial flourishes to distinguish his film, such as the shot of Cooper, very disapproving of Davis's emergence from her shell, looming in the foreground with her back to the camera, forbiddingly drumming her fingernails against the wall while Davis busies herself in the background. No composition could more clearly communicate the relationship these two women have to each other, and it's all the more satisfying, therefore, ***SPOILER ALERT*** when Davis inadvertently sends the old biddy flying down the stairs to her death.But all that messy business is forgotten by the film's end, Davis triumphs (as if anyone doubted she would), and all's right with the world.

Bette Davis, herself a repressed personality, understood the part, and underplayed it beautifully in the film version scripted by Casey Robinson. For several reasons, not the least its luminous B/W cinematography, wonderful sets and Irving Rapper's sensitive direction, the film furthered the careers of its three stars, Paul Henreid, Davis and Claude Rains. And it became a favorite not only with females but with many film-goer--for its intelligence and its moving theme taking charge of one's own life, risks or no, is a good thing... The storyline is unusually intense. Charlotte Vale is so bullied and deprived by her mother than she has to be sent to a sanatorium run by a gruff but kindly doctor. Recovering, she goes on a voyage to South America and falls in love with an already-married man. Back at the sanitarium, she decides to help a young girl, who turns out to be the man's daughter. They can never get together; but they have their love for the daughter, and what they feel about one another. There are some good performances in this interesting and hard-too-film story.They include Gladys Cooper as the control-freak puritan mother, Bonita Granville, Ilka Chase, Mary Wickes, John Loder, Lee Patrick, Franklin Pangborn, Katherine Alexander and James Rennie. Fred Maclean's set decorations, Perc Westmore's intelligent makeup and Orry-Kelly's costumes are enormous assets to this B/W filing. Sol Polito's cinematography, Robert Haas's art direction and Max Steiner famous music also deserve praise for their professional artistry. The Victoran actions by the mother toward Charlotte Vale (Davis) are so extreme that they strike one as something someone in wealthy circles with a large family nearby should have stopped; but the way in which Charlotte treats her mother when she returns is handled interestingly, in a low-key fashion. It might have been done differently; but what we have is extraordinary. I admire the slow blossoming of the person that is Charlotte during the South American voyage, and the way the film treats self assertion as having nothing to do with others primarily and everything to do with being oneself by one's own lights. Hall Wallis produced this fine and lasting character study; one could only wish he had allowed Ayn Rand to write the screenplay, as she did for the equally interesting psychological drama Love Letters two years later.

She is finally able to bloom as a person under his care.The best part of her character is that when Charlotte is in a position to help a youngster who is much like herself, she does not treat the youngster as she was treated by her mother her entire life.  I've noticed more than once in my life that women tend to repeat their relationship with their mother in their bringing up their own kids.  Charlotte is much smarter than that and treats the child with love and care.  The fact that Charlotte is in love with her father is besides the point, and this is why this movie is better than your standard 1940s Warner Brothers soap opera - it has the elements of a soap intact but explores them in a different way than you would normally see.  After Charlotte becomes a new person, she is able to relate to her mother and her mother warms up to her (as much as she can) and she is much more accepted socially and even within her own family.

In Summer of '42, a couple of sex-obsessed but inexperienced teenage boys take their summertime girlfriends to the theater and their choice of pictures is Now, Voyager. As the boys try to cop a cheap feel, and as the girls swat away their advances, I don't know how much of the picture they actually got to see. But since this title was in a stack of unwatched movies, my own decision was an easy one to make.The title comes from an obscure line from the poet Walt Whitman in my summary above. The 'Voyager' of the film is the character portrayed by Bette Davis, an emotionally scarred young woman whose domineering mother has made her a cloistered wreck. With the help of a patient and understanding psychiatrist (Claude Rains), Charlotte Vail (Davis) discards the remnants of her abusive past and begins to grow as a self confident young woman, eventually catching the eye of a gentleman who shows interest in her aboard a cruise ship. As their romance blossoms, Jerry Durrance (Paul Henried) reveals the details of an unhappy marriage in which he's trapped, with a daughter suffering the consequences of a mother who like Miss Vail's own, is incapable of showing love or compassion.In sharp counterpoint to Mrs. Henry Vale's (Gladys Cooper) attitudes regarding wealth and societal status, Durrance offers one of the most compelling and effective arguments ever made in cinema when he speaks to Charlotte about finding happiness - two people having fun together, getting a kick out of simple, little things and finding beauty in them, and sharing confidences with a loved one you wouldn't share with anyone else in the world. It's the kind of advice that would make practitioners like Dr. Jaquith (Rains) obsolete if one would only take it to heart and follow it.Bette Davis had a way of tugging on viewer heartstrings in many of the roles she portrayed in her films. In this picture she quite literally transforms from an ugly duckling into an attractive young woman, while running a gamut of emotions coming to grips with love, losing it, and finding the way back again. As the viewer, one may find it beneficial to keep the tissues handy to deal with the emotional ups and downs of the story.

I have heard on more than one occasion that Davis did much of the directing herself. If this truly is the case, then her esoteric animation in most of the compositions not only defines the dimensions of the frames, but it almost totally denatures the film's narrative intent. It is more than apparent that any director of note would not have been essentially required to compose even the most difficult shots given the Davis presence and her mastery of her craft. The metamorphosis she creates here may be the finest in all of her work Charlotte's vision becomes our vision and the more clearly we see with Davis the more refined our vision becomes to peruse our inner and outer selves. She has no equal in the history of film-making as her genius is proficient to elevate our awareness of certain experiences in life, thus easily placing her along side all great artistic minds of the twentieth century, inclusive of writers, artists, and composers. This, along with many of her other films, bears testimony that her filmic evolution reaffirms the ultimate purpose of a medium that must reconfigure its galaxy of stars in a cosmology that only she can consecrate.

How she suffers with the details of her new perception of herself before the close contact with friends inside the cruiser, it's of course a matter that bores her ; but the fashionable new look of her figure is almost all which she got of that opportunity, when the captain there enjoys her with such an elegy that keeps her in her own importance of being liked around watching also if she is not dull with such a husband already married, a glad story with a sad taste for the next.

Now, Voyager is the Cinderella fairy tale as woman's picture, a genre which serves as the dignified grandmother to the modern chick flick. The heroine of a woman's picture is required to suffer and sacrifice, and Bette does plenty of both thanks to her harpy mother, played by the fearsome Gladys Cooper, and her unattainable object of desire, played by the winsome Paul Henreid. She must also survive an avalanche of symbolism the director invokes pretty much every visual cliché imaginable, from thick-lens eyeglasses (repression!) to ocean liners (transformation!) to the Statue of Liberty (liberation! -- what, did you think James Cameron came up with the idea?). Still, it works, in part because it's so bloody heartfelt that the most implausible, floridly written scene can jerk your tears, and in part because universal myths always have power to engage us.Which is not to say Now, Voyager is timeless. It has all the hallmarks of a 1942 film -- shadowy black-and-white cinematography (a Citizen Kane hangover), modest production values (there was a war going on, after all) and Claude Rains (he was the hardest working man in show business, which is fortunate for us because that hatchet-faced little Limey was a brilliant actor). The film is also informed by a faintly anti-romantic, pseudo-Freudian view of human nature (see King's Row, also featuring Mr. Rains). Bette, masking those Bette Davis Eyes with the aforementioned glasses and the bushiest fake brows in screen history (she looks like wolverines are gnawing at her forehead), is mousy and badly dressed because of her domineering mother, but before she can become confident and fashionable she needs to have a nervous breakdown so she can escape for some R&R in a pre-Snake Pit loony bin. There she is under the care of the good Dr. Rains, who preaches a vague gospel of independence and self-determination, which seems to entail buying Bette a new wardrobe and a ticket on a South American cruise. Odd course of treatment, but it works, and a fling with a married, strangely accented architect (Henreid, who was making Casablanca at the same time which would explain why he still sounds like Victor Laszlo) somehow transforms Bette from a frightened girl to an assertive woman who has no qualms telling her mother where to get off (but not too harshly, of course, since she's the well-brought up daughter of a Boston Brahman). That's the skeleton of the story -- the plot is riddled with absurd coincidences and unlikely twists, but the contrivances aren't too annoying since we know they're just part of Bette's, well, voyage. Rent it, have fun.

The story is hackneyed and unbelievable by turns but made involving and real by the playing of the stellar cast. The cinematography is generally excellent (some ugly process/stock shots as the cruise liner passes through Brazil excepted), as is, for once, Max Steiner's romantic score, taking in references to Cole Porter's Night and Day and Mahler along the way. The three supporting leads, Heinreid, Rains and Cooper are superb, the first two delivering naturally engaging performances, the latter acceptably over-the-top in her Mommie Dearest role. There's also a great cameo by Mary Wickes as the mother's long-suffering but savvy nurse and I was also impressed by the child actress who plays Heinreid's daughter and acts as the final catalyst to bond the main characters together. But of course it's Davis' film from start to finish. On camera almost all the time, she exudes star quality throughout but at the same time constantly modulates her performance as her character's moods, hopes and fears adapt to her changing circumstances. Some of the dialogue is a bit hokey, (Phew that was a scorcher!, pants her young suitor after a passionate kiss, early on in the piece) but all is redeemed by what follows and especially of course, the justly famous understated closing lines as Davis and Heinreid resign themselves to accept their less than starry fates.

In it, she plays a woman called Charlotte Vale who has been kept repressed by her monstrous mother. Via a kindly psychiatrist she begins a process of healing by slowly entering the adult world. This begins with a love affair on a cruise ship and ends with her becoming a surrogate mother to a troubled child, who reminds her of her younger self.The relationship between mother and child is a central theme. Where Charlotte's real mother is an overbearing bully, Charlotte cultivates a loving relationship with the girl she takes under her wing. She gains fulfilment in this mother role, so much so that she chooses this over romantic love. This of course, makes the ending to Now, Voyager a little unorthodox. The two lovers do not embrace and give the audience closure. Instead, we are left with a situation that looks like it will be fraught with unresolved issues. Not a typical happy ending at all.Gladys Cooper was particularly excellent here as the demonic mother figure. She was a pretty intense and scary presence and was surely worthy of her best supporting Oscar nomination. While Bette Davis, Claude Rains and Paul Henreid are good also. I'm not hugely familiar with the Hollywood melodrama, so I can't really put this film into too much of a context, although I am led to believe that this is one of the best of its kind.

'Now, Voyager' not only qualifies, it might very well be the epitome of this kind of cinema. A young woman, held down by a domineering mother who manipulates and controls her, finally breaks away to live her OWN life, free to do as she pleases, even becoming more beautiful as she does so! You get the idea. Bette Davis was certainly at the top of her game when she made 'Now, Voyager' in 1942. She plays dowdy future spinster Charlotte Vale, who lives with and under the thumb of her mean old mother, um, Mrs. Vale (Gladys Cooper). Charlotte's pretty darn ugly at the first of the film, big bushy eyebrows, dressed unattractively, and supposedly overweight. I couldn't tell she was overweight, but everyone says that she is, so... Help arrives in the person of Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), who through therapy helps Charlotte discover her inner (and outer) beauty. Charlotte then takes an ocean cruise, where, now incredibly beautiful, she meet and falls in love with Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid). If you've never seen 'Now, Voyager,' this is the film where Henreid lights two cigarettes at the same time, then takes one from his lips and hands it to Davis. In fact, he does it four or five times during the movie. Jerry is married when they meet, so that puts a damper on their romance. The ending is a bit unexpected for a film of this type; you might expect that Jerry gets a divorce or his wife dies and he and Charlotte end up together, but instead Charlotte ends up caring for one of his troubled daughters, which she considers his 'gift' to her and a way to always have him in her life. Their relationship remains platonic otherwise. They both seem content with this resolution, and the film ends with Bette Davis' classic line, Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon... we have the stars! I enjoyed 'Now, Voyager' for the performances and some of the dialogue, which alternates between sharp and soapy. Paul Henreid looks and sounds as if he walked right out of 'Casablanca.' Claude Rains is good, as always, as the shrink who helps Charlotte. But this is Bette Davis' show for the most part and it is one of her finest portrayals.

Bette's appearance before entering the sanatorium is very frumpy indeed Her hair pulled into a tight bun, eyebrows thickened with a dark pencil, glasses and a plain dress padded out to make poor Bette look 20 pounds heavier. She was obviously courting the academy by allowing herself to be uglied-up in such a cartoonish way. It is the kind of role that a modern day actress like Charlize Theron would have loved to sink her teeth into. Miss Davis's look is rather comical and had me in stitches, probably not the reaction they were going for, she looks more like a parody of a matron or some odd ball character on MAD TV. Very heavy handed indeed.But miracles do happen in the sanatorium! Not only does Bette undergo a positive emotional change but she also undergoes a physical one to match her new mental state. When she is revealed for the first time after her long stay, she is dressed to the nines with a fashionable hat and tailored dress suit, she looks thinner, stylish and her eyebrows have been thinned out and her lips painted a deep red, giving her that movie star aura that Bette made famous. Who knew the funny farm had a stylist on hand? This is the kind of place that stars of today would dream of going to. Not only will they leave with a new attitude they would also have a new look to match. Britney Spears are you listening? The rest of the movie is rather long winded and to be honest the plot is bit twisted She falls for a married man, somehow raises his 9 year old child, no one questions there peculiar relationship, she is engaged to be married to another man but breaks it off rather calmly, and then goes back to pine for her married foreign lover. Whew! But there are a few memorable moments that will leave you in stitches. For instance when Bette decides to assert herself and tell her mother that she wants to live her own life, her new found confidence gives her poor, old, mean, sickly mother a heart attack and kills her. If only in the real world killing a disagreeable parent was so easy. If it were we would have a lot of dead parents on our hands.The money shot in the end is well worth the wait. We find Bette and her married lover looking out the window questioning the validity of their relationship, when Bette looks towards the Heavens and says the famous line, Why ask for the moon when we have the stars. At which point the camera pans up to a painted backdrop of a black sky filled with little points of light, and for that magical Bette moment we should all be thankful.Stay Fresh,XHedda Lettuce www.hedda.com "},{"Title":"Definitive Davis Showcase Still Works Despite the Contrivances","Date":"4 March 2006","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Let's face it - this 1942 Warner Bros film classic is a hoot. Directed by journeyman studio veteran Irving Rapper, it's an unabashed, only-in-Hollywood soap opera with Bette Davis at the peak of her popularity as she evolves from a distraught, overweight spinster to a glamorous Boston society social maven in about ten minutes. Probably to Tom Cruise's horror, it's also a big valentine to the positive effects of psychoanalysis, a new science which must have been viewed with a great deal of skepticism at the time. Yet for all its plot contrivances - and there are quite a few - this is ultimately sublime entertainment thanks mainly to the stellar performances and the simple fact that the story is never dull.The plot focuses on heiress Charlotte Vale, a walking disaster of sheltered neurosis in sensible shoes and a virtual slave to one of the most dominating mothers in screen history. Charlotte's concerned sister-in-law Lisa brings Dr. Jaquith to the Vale mansion where he convinces Charlotte to seek psychiatric treatment at a posh sanitarium. Although still insecure after she leaves on a life-altering pleasure cruise, she finds inevitable romance with architect Jerry Durrance, who of course is married to an unstable woman. Overcome with guilt and breaking an engagement to an available prospect, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium, where she meets troubled young Tina, who of course turns out to be Jerry's daughter. From this ultimate contrivance, plot threads get sewn together in short order, cigarettes lit under the moonlight and Davis coos her big line, Don't let's ask for the moon; we have the stars. In what amounts to a showcase for her versatility, Davis is superb in both before and after modes, even playing a romantic shipboard teenager with sincerity in a flashback sequence. Paul Henried plays Jerry with requisite Continental charm, but he is truly overmatched by Davis in their scenes together. Claude Rains fares better in the pivotal role of Dr. Jaquith providing his medical advice with convincing paternal authority and genuine warmth. Gladys Cooper - who would play the far warmer mother of Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady two decades later - portrays Charlotte's iron-willed mother in a sharply uncompromising manner befitting the intimidating stature she holds in the family. Broadway luminary Ilka Chase is fine in one of her few screen appearances as sympathetic Lisa, and Bonita Granville - grown-up since her sinister turn as the rumor-mongering child in William Wyler's These Three seven years earlier - plays the bratty niece June with enthusiasm. The print condition on the DVD is excellent, though there are no other extras included.

But if you can swallow the premise--that seeing a therapist like Claude Rains can do wonders for your image and your wardrobe--then by all means sit back and enjoy. But frankly, this is carrying the soap opera premise of the story to new heights.It all seems like a parody--especially when the lovers light their cigarettes as a kind of foreplay. But Bette and Paul Henried do everything in such great style that you forgive the hokey plot for making them appear just a trifle too sophisticated. But watching the film, I couldn't help wondering if Carol Burnett ever did a parody on this one???I couldn't take any of this seriously--except for the performance that Gladys Cooper gives as the domineering, possessive mother. She is a marvel to behold--never once does she give you one reason to pity her. It is the most savage portrayal of a cold-hearted mother I've ever seen on the screen. Her scenes with Davis are the strongest in the film. Both are so intense you can feel the sparks. It's as though Davis finally finds someone who can match her in intensity.Claude Rains is more mellow than usual as Dr. Jacquith, dispensing advice that changes Bette's outlook on life. Max Steiner's score is a romantic one, fully deserving its Oscar for Best Original Dramatic Score.

You will not believe that Bette Davis is transformed from a dumpy, borderline-suicidal spinster into a woman that fills the hearts of two men with deepest devotion. You will believe that she peeled off the padded dresses, wiped off the greasepaint uni-brow, and made with the job lots of designer dresses.You'll also believe the almost impossible relationship she had with her mother. There was an almost homicidal gusto to Gladys Cooper's performance as the awful Mrs. Vale, a delight in tormenting the one vulnerable creature fate has placed under her power. The script (and apparently, Olive Prouty's book) were honest enough to leave the relationship unresolved and unresolvable. The moments when Davis holds down her gorge and answers the old battle-axe politely but firmly are among the most moving in a mere Hollywood movie.The scenes of Davis and Paul Henried and their circumscribed little romance are touching and realistic--two people not happy, but not willing to risk the chaos that would result if they went looking for it.Only John Loder, as the Nice Young Man who suddenly shows up as vague competition for Henreid, feels out of place. He's a plot device, and the only thing I can say about the character is that he is gone quickly and that Loder did his duties gracefully.Several people have praised Irving Rapper's direction here, and it's polished enough, but nothing extraordinary. In particular, Davis is still, except in the scenes with Cooper, way too phony and practiced. You can hear the wheels running in her head, not to mention her nice, clean diction as she declaims to the third row of the balcony at times. There was none of the wit, delicacy, or oddly appropriate artificiality that she displayed under Vincent Sherman's direction in one of her last big weep-a-thons, MR. SKEFFINGTON.

The movie started of like a melodramatic soap-like movie, with a bad visual look and Bette Davis looked ridicules to say the least. However about half way through the movie I finally began to see where the movie was heading to and the story actually turned out to be rather original, gripping and effective.The story at first seems to be rather formulaic; An ugly duckling turns into a beautiful swan. And in the first halve the movie unfortunately also IS formulaic. When the main character gets on a cruise and meets her first(?) and true love, I was worried that the movie would turn into a typical '30's/'40's melodramatic and formulaic love-story, like dozens of were made, in mainly the '30's and early '40's. The movie however took some original and surprising twists after that. The love-story is not your average love-story were girl meets boy and they start falling in love. The movie and its story is multiple layered; The man (Paul Henreid) is married to a woman who is sort of in the same situation as the girl (Bette Davis) he falls in love with used to be; a timid, insecure woman. The man also has a daughter to whom the girls is really starting to relate to. What at first starts as a simple no-worries romance turns later into a deep bond between a man and a woman, who understand- and help each other. 'Faith' brings them together multiple times later throughout the movie and they always keep feeling a sort of connection and love for each other.The story doesn't always flow well and too often things occur too sudden. But oh well, that is sort of fitting for early '40's style of film-making. So if you've seen more movies from this time period, this hardly should be a complaint.This is really the sort of movie that is carried by its characters. So it definitely helps that the cast is a solid one. Bette Davis and Paul Henreid were good as the main characters and Gladys Cooper was great as the tough and strict mother who is not too happy with her 'unwanted' youngest daughter (the Bette Davis role). Smaller roles are there for Claude Rains and Mary Wickes, who always was surprising good and enjoyable in her role.Despite the fact that this is a movie from 1942 it looks like it was made in the early '30's. It makes this movie also perhaps look way more outdated than it in fact really is. The production values really aren't too high and it shows on the screen. I also wasn't too fond of the melodramatic musical score from Max Steiner. I agree with Bette Davis on this issue; it was distracting. Ironicaly Steiner won an (and the only) Oscar for this movie. The movie was nominated for 2 more Oscars for Bette Davis' and Gladys Cooper's performances. In my book not a classic must-see, the first halve and the production values of the movie aren't good enough for that but the story and cast compensates a lot.

I know of no other movie from a book that so overtly says now this next part is a bit boring but it comes from the book, you see, right here in the next chapter.Bette Davis stars, if that is of interest. She is not believable in the modern sense. But it hardly matters because the character she plays is rich.Why do we want movies and books about rich people? I believe the reason is something more than the character shorthand we use. Oh we have a doctor here and an architect, each assignment carrying context that we add to the story without having to be shown. But wealth is used as a different sort of shorthand.Wealthy people can can just do things without refactoring their lives. Want to spend six months at a sanatorium? Want to take a cruise to South America next week? Want to leave the cruise without worry because you know you can take a flight?Want to adopt a child? Want to defy social conventions with impunity? Just do it, you're rich.Storytelling is about weaving with ribbons, and it the great challenge of the storyteller to draw these ribbons from reality for us. Its the first thing. Its the most interesting thing. Simply using devices like this seems like a cheat. The story has no value because we know it begins with cartoon conventions.Edith Wharton is valuable because she stepped into this shorthand and made having a wealthy life as complicated as any life. The ribbons she teased out were newly born. These here are used.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life. "}]
