[{"Title":"Deserved better than it got","Date":"5 March 2005","Score":"88 out of 110 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" It's a pity that the critics gave 'Four Rooms' as hard a time as they did back in 1995, because, for everything that can be said to be wrong with it, it really does sparkle with creativity and a desire to stand out from the rest of the crowd. And let's face it, there was enough popular talent involved, including Alison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and, last but not least, Quentin Tarantino, for it to have been hailed as an instant cult classic. Instead, it was bashed into submission and retreated very quickly to the back of nearly everyone's resume. With retrospect most of this reproach was probably ill-deserved - 'Four Rooms' does have its blatant moments of weakness, but then again so do a lot of the more half-baked cookie-cutter comedies which have somehow garnered more admiration than this. On the whole it's a very unusual and interesting combination - an offbeat, frisky and strangely feel-good comedy with some sinister undertones and lots of weird, intricate little details. Consisting of four 20-minute segments, each assembled by a different director's hands, it takes us through the various happenings inside separate rooms of the same hotel on New Year's Eve, as experienced by Ted, the only bellhop still left standing for the night shift. There is the slight feeling of inconsistency in moving from one directing style to the next, and a couple of attempts to interconnect the segments are a little self-contradictory. Some of it works and some it doesn't, but the end result is an episodic anthology that, if nothing too spectacular, still proves itself to be very likable in the long run.'The Missing Ingredient' and 'the Wrong Man' are often credited with constituting the weaker half of the film, and I can't really say I disagree. 'The Missing Ingredient' tries hard to be risqu√©, but falls pretty short - for a story concerning a coven of bare-breasted witches trying to extract an unwilling man's semen for use in a ritual, it's remarkably innocuous and fluffy, and the visual effects only add a layer of tackiness to boot. 'The Wrong Man' is a tad more snappy and sports some stylish direction (the shot where Sigfried grabs the ringing telephone is right-on), but is ultimately swallowed up in its frenzied editing. We can vaguely understand what's happening in this segment (if not, then Ted does drop a pretty big hint later on in the film), but it makes itself unnecessarily incoherent, with bizarre imagery that adds nothing but extra confusion (the baby flashback, anyone?). It's almost as though Alexandre Rockwell isn't sure whether he wants us to be in on the whole set-up with Sigfried and Angela, or confused and in the dark like Ted, and in the end tries to accommodate both perspectives, which doesn't really wash.It's once we reach the second half that the true quality really starts to seep its way in, and the film suddenly becomes very rewarding. 'The Misbehaviours' is a spirited little contribution that combines a moderate dose of macabre darkness with its cartoon-like innocence. Antonio Banderas certainly hits a good spot as the no-nonsense father who appoints Ted to keep an eye on his two young children while he's out, whilst the children themselves are rebellious but not irritating, all making for a surprisingly sharp and sophisticated slice of knockabout. 'The Man from Hollywood', meanwhile, is equally brilliant - Tarantino's vibrant, well-scripted take on Roald Dahl's chilling short story, 'the Man from the South', which pits Ted in the same room as cocky Hollywood director Chester Rush (and it's always a treat to see Quentin himself tackle such a winking, self-depreciating role). It manages to be tense and enjoyable, with the usual smart direction that any Tarantino fan should be able to appreciate. Overall, there's enough vitality in these particular segments to just about redeem the shakiness of the first half.Besides, we have Tim Roth playing our hapless protagonist throughout, and, yes, that is a lot. He proves himself to be very capable in a comic performance, bringing enough gentle magnetism to his character Ted the bellhop, through his good intentions, perseverance and various neurotic mannerisms, to get us genuinely attached to him. It is hard not to come away with the impression that all four directors had a slightly different take on Ted's disposition - he goes from being timid and impressionable to obtuse and jumpy, then highly-strung and a little devious, and finally composed and relatively rational - but Roth does well in single-handedly bridging these gaps and, with the many mishaps his character has to endure over the course of the night, ensures that all changes in temper seem understandable. He retains his good-natured lovability for the entire running time, and, for anyone who can really relate to poor Ted (like yours truly), he'll have you rooting for him to the very satisfying end.To my knowledge, there was never any other film quite like 'Four Rooms' and, judging by just how unwelcome this one was made to feel when it arrived, there probably won't be another for quite some time. It remains an ambitious and not entirely successful little sleeper, but has a good deal going for it nonetheless, and I urge all fans of Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance. Who knows? One day, it might just make a fresh start and find the cult audience that appreciates it yet.

This rather a splendid and incredibly funny little film starts from quite amusing title sequence and gets better with every segment. As almost all of us can say the first one called The Missing Ingredient is more or less a disappointment and if you watch Four rooms for the first time I can practically swear that the film is only getting started. Second segment The Wrong man is already much better. David Proval who played Richie Aprile in the television series The Sopranos is just bloody terrific. The Misbehavers (segment number three starring Antonio Banderas and directed by Robert Rodriguez) provides some of the most irresistible stuff of the movie.And what's nicest, they save the best as last. Final segment The Man from the Hollywood is already a bit of a masterpiece and once again it shows so clearly how ingenious writer/actor/director Quentin Tarantino is. Oscar from Pulp Fiction alone tells that he has an unbelievable talent to create amazing dialogue that truly entertains. I adore this fourth part of the film very much, sometimes I've been watching only it. I know many people are thinking Tim Roth is ridiculously overacting his role of the bellhop but I can't and simply won't agree on that one. In my opinion he makes a stylish and heart-warming tribute to Jerry Lewis and in the same time proofs he's a talented, clever and downright hilarious comedian who doesn't overact even half as much as for example Jim Carrey. Four rooms is an underrated future's cult classic.

It would also be improper, since it was not intended to be anything less than an anthology from four notable independent filmmakers  Alexandre Rockwell, Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino.The first episode is exactly the sort of thing that someone in a high school drama production would want to do, but can't get away with in a high school drama production.  It's juvenile, unfunny, and lifeless, but it has the (pointless) nudity and lines of dialogue likeWitch #1  I am your mother.Witch #2  Then why are we sleeping together?that sound like the screenwriter is giggling and thinking, I can't believe I'm getting away with this!  I'm so clever!Nothing is at stake in the first episode;  it's generally expected that a story must have conflict in order to BE a story.  This has none.  Just some half-baked jokes and a pair of topless women (If I wanted that, I'd skip renting a movie and go out instead.)Second episode is a hair better, but you'll find yourself crying Why doesn't Ted the Bellboy do insert plot resolution here and get the bloody hell out of there!  When it finally does end, you're disheartened to find that it had no reason to exist.  Two snips with a pair of scissors,  a bit of tape, and we wouldn't know the difference.  Roll opening credits, go straight to the Rodriguez segment.Third episode has some structural support to keep it from caving in on itself.  The surprise in the middle (I won't give it away, don't worry) is horrifying enough to give the segment some heft.  Rodriguez and his d.p., Guillermo Navarro, move it along dexterously and (as usual) have a good handle on visual comedy.The last segment is the best.  I think it's safe to say that Quentin Tarantino has, officially, never disappointed me as a director or screenwriter.  My heart leapt as soon as I heard his trademark dialogue coming from the lips of Marisa Tomei as Four Rooms segued from The Misbehavers to The Man From Hollywood.  I wasn't sure if his take on Ted the Bellhop's misadventures was going to be any good, but I knew that if he wrote it and helmed it, it wasn't going to be all bad.What a pleasant surprise (still just talking about the fourth segment here). This part of the movie, with its ridiculous premise (lifted form an old Hitchcock episode, which it acknowledges out loud), moves along speedily, and the actors take to it as naturally as any other movies by Q.T. Basically playing himself, Tarantino is hilarious.  If anything, he knows A) how people really act when they're drunk (i.e. not like Dudley Moore caricatures)  B) why people think he's so obnoxious, like a real-life, fast-talking Jar Jar Binks and  C) how to put some bang in his visual storytelling.  It's low-rent Tarantino, don't get me wrong, but it's also the best part of Four Rooms.All in all, the first film I've ever seen that starts out with a loathsome, horrifying badness, gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes, and ends as good as one would like.  Just don't make me watch it again.

Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed Love American Style on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. Each story is taking place in a different room of a hotel the same night. It was made between the time Tarantino made Pulp Fiction and worked on Dusk Till Dawn with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four storiesThe Missing Ingredient - Madona has simply never looked better and her come get me dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.The Wrong Man &#x96; Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing In the Soup so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted's sex organ is a cinema classic.The Misbehavers &#x96; Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room, but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale, with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.The Man From Hollywood &#x96; This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character. He even reprises the tasty beverage line from Pulp Fiction. Beals has already found her way to this room by the time bellboy Roth arrives and she delivers more good lines. I was impressed that Tarantino built up his suspense before the contest began and then did not try to extend the suspense but ended things on the first attempt.The best bit in the whole film might be Roth's phone call to his boss. Marisa Tomei answers the phone in a room full of comatose post-New Years Eve partygoers. She then does a version of her My Cousin Vinnie expert witness routine, this time concerning types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it as the other player maniacally manipulates his controller throughout the entire phone conversation. "},{"Title":"a cool batch of 90's indie pathos","Date":"6 November 2004","Score":"25 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Four Rooms was concocted like one of those many, many collaborative efforts from directors in the 60's and 70's (i.e. The Witches, Ro.Go.PaG, Boccaccio '70, etc), except this would revolve around a bell-hop on New Years Eve. It disqualifies itself as being any kind of masterpiece or classic in independent film-making, and sometimes the filmmakers (Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell, and Quentin Tarantino, the last two also serving as executive producer) look like they're relishing too much in their (limited) clout and exuberance to concentrate. As was with many others who viewed the film, I found that the first two segments were the lesser ones, and the last two were the best ones. It all comes down, in this case, to which two were funnier. So, let's break each one downAllison Anders' film is a quirky, quasi-lesbian take on a coven of witches, featuring the likes of Madonna and Lily Taylor, are the first to shake up (perhaps for the better in this one) Ted the bell-hop. Ted, by the way, is played with a continuous, nervous-type of fervor that goes from being innocuous, to annoying, and then acceptable again. It's also interesting to see how his character goes through different motions when under each director (for example, in Rodriguez's film he's more of a cartoon-type of character, and in Tarantino's film he hearkens slightly to his previous collaborations with the director, quieter, on edge in a particular way). Some of the laughs are surrounded by a kind of attitude put forth by the director that seems a little off. Maybe I'm the wrong audience for it, though- the women in the audience may appreciate it, or rather amused by it, more than I. I give it a B-Alexandre Rockwell's The Wrong Man is my least favorite of the bunch, as Ted gets stuck with a couple of crazed fetishists (David Proval and Jennifer Beals). The problem here lies with two things- the fact that the comedic timing/chemistry is a little iffy/off with the three actors, and that the writing doesn't come off like it's naturally funny. When Beals' character Angela runs off about Ted's private parts, this could be funny, but it's more 'ho-ho' than 'ha-ha' to me. Some of the tension from Roth brings some laughs, but not enough to compensate the uncomfortable atmosphere around the whole segment. I give it a C-The third segment, The Misbehaviors, displays how clever and quick Rodriguez can be with physical comedy (slapstick) as well as in getting laughs from kids (as he did here and there in his Spy Kids movies). It is also a boost that the whole segment comes off as though it's like a live-action Looney Tunes short- it's so ridiculous that in some scenes I burst out laughing (i.e. Ted's reaction to the corpse). The set-up with the parents was also amusing in how Banderas and Tamlyn Tomita act towards the kids. Then the pay-off knocks it out of the park. Grade AThen we come to the closure, featuring the indie wunderkind at the time, Tarantino, as he takes on two sources of inspiration- Rohald Dahl's Man from the South short story, later translated through Alfred Hitchcock's television show. It's a smart, hip little piece of Hollywood satire from Tarantino, as he himself plays an overly obnoxious Hollywood filmmaker, with two guys by his side (Paul Calderon and Bruce Willis), as they take a gamble right after the stroke of midnight. It took me a couple of time to watch this to really get into it, but when I did it was even more promising. The camera-work in the scene (via 'Dogs' and 'Pulp' cinematographer Andrzej Sekula) is deliberately paced, and it's perfectly leisurely for the pace of the last segment. That much, if not all, of the dialog is funny it's because of the skill and chemistry between the four of them. Plus, a little prologue with Marisa Tomei and Kathy Griffin gives the indication of what insanity is in store. Grade- A.So, is this film a success? For it's time, I'm not sure. With the power of four million off the success of each director's previous efforts (Tarantino with 'Dogs', Rodriguez with El Mariachi, Anders with Gas, Food, and Lodging, and Rockwell with In the Soup, all from the 92 Sundance place), they did whatever they wanted, and it's not the success it could've been. On the other hand, when one looks at the films in perspective, it could've been a lot worse, and it wasn't. At the least, it works as one of the quintessential party movies for fans of the 90's new-wave crop.

Once a major hang out spot for movie stars of the 30's, 40's and first part of the 50's, it is now an out of date fire hazard, and it is falling apart! But on New Years Eve, a new bellhop will have the craziest night of his life in this very hotel.When I was thinking of Tarantino flicks to purchase, Four Rooms came to my mind. At first I was hesitant, and for good reason. After all, I had read nothing but bad reviews for this film. But what I found in it was a bizarre little comedy that wasn't so bad after all.Four Rooms is an anthology film with four 'episodes' about a fading hotel on News Years Eve, and with a quirky bellhop named Ted (Tim Roth) and his misadventures on this one crazy night. The first episode entitled The Missing Ingredient is about a group of witches staying in the hotel who need some sperm in order to complete a spell. And guess who knocks on the door...Ted the bellhop! The next episode, The Wrong Man is a shorter episode about Ted getting mistaken for another man. This is certainly the strangest of the episodes. Then next comes the hilarious The Misbehavers. Ted is asked to babysit two kids of a Mexican gangster (Antonio Banderas in a parody of himself), and how everything possible can go wrong. And the final episode, The Man From Hollywood (the best) is directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is about a cocky Hollywood new-comer (Tarantino also in a parody of himself) who rents out the Penthouse for New Years Eve, and then plays a dangerous game that ends the film in a very funny way.I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this film. After reading all the bad reviews, I was afraid I wouldn't like this it, but it wasn't as bad as they said.

Lucky for him he's a director, otherwise he'd never appear on film. Oh, how I wish it were so.Then there's the plot. Stolen from a Hitchcock story which was stolen from a Roald Dahl story. They do acknowledge the Hitchcock thing, but it's merely a not-so-clever ploy to try and disguise the fact that he didn't even come up with a story, but used some previously reheated leftovers from 30 years ago. There are no twists whatsoever on the Hitchcock theme that Tarantino describes.

Yes, even this one was insisted upon in high school, though perhaps not as strongly as QT's first two. This portmanteau follows bellhop Tim Roth as he gets into several adventures over New Year's Eve. I remember liking this one quite a bit, but, viewing it now, it's just too uneven to be worthwhile. Anders' first segment is easily the low point, thankfully. Any film starring Madonna should be immediately suspect, and everything about this tale of witches is awful. Rockwell's segment is a bit of an improvement, but too forgettable. Rodriguez's segment is the one I remember being the best, and it thankfully does hold up okay. Antonio Banderas is hilarious in it, and most of the jokes hit. I remember QT's segment being the worst originally, but I actually thought it was by far the best this time around. It usually gets flack, I think, because it stars Tarantino, but he's comfortable here playing a pompous movie director. It's honestly his best performance (if it had been readily available, I might have suffered through Destiny Turns on the Radio again) and his direction is pretty brilliant. The one thing that really drags this whole movie down is Tim Roth. Man, I remember loving him when I was a teenager, and, though I criticized his performance in Reservoir Dogs above, he's on Olivier's level there compared to his awful mugging here. Even if QT's segment were the weakest, it would automatically be upgraded to the strongest just because he's the only one who settles Roth the crap down, a bit at least.

In closing , I will just say Tim Roth was truly outstanding , especially with his mannerisms.

It's a terrible bore, routinely shot, broadly and blandly lighted, and written for or by children, I'm not sure which. Are we to care that Tim Roth stars throughout (and is mildly comic as the bell hop)? Not really. And what about the stars who populate one episode, the misogynist witch episode with Madonna among many others, or that Marisa Tomei and Bruce Willis of all people show up? No. The story is just silly without redemption, not funny, not sarcastic, not clever, not redemptive. Even what you might call dark humor is neither dark nor funny. It's not fair to just say it's bad, or that it's stupid, but that's the basic impulse. There are funny moments, and in a campy kind of way it's original even though, to a large extent, the works are derivative (the Tarantino quarter is directly taken from an Alfred Hitchcock television episode). Speaking of TV, it really looks like TV the way it is so brightly lit, as if all done for a comic book illustrator, and yet it lacks any kind of real comic book appeal, not even in the Kill Bill sense. No, this is just a throwaway, an attempt to have some fun, but at the viewer's expense. I don't think this cost much to make, so it shouldn't cost much to avoid, either.

For Ted the Bellhop, things go from strange, to stranger, to even stranger in the comedy Four Rooms, a film that is really four films by four separate teams of filmmakers, all linked by location and a single character under increasingly urgent circumstances. When another character asks Ted his problem, his response is right on the money Problem? I haven't got a problem. I've got f*cking problems. Plural. One could also say that about this movie, a confusing, pointless mess of stale, unfunny humor, overacted characters, and a load of Hollywood stars and filmmakers so prestigious that it makes us wonder why such people would involve themselves such an unentertaining flop.Four Rooms stars Tim Roth in a biting, fanatical performance as Ted, a bellhop working at a faded hotel. He is the only person on duty this night, and he really gets his hands full. In the first story, called The Missing Ingredient, written and directed by Alison Anders, Ted checks in a clan of witches who try to perform a resurrection but can't because they lack a certain component in their spell. Naturally, its semen. What other bodily fluid is there in movies these days? Ted is the only male around, therefore, its only a matter of time before Ted finds himself seduced by a bare-breasted witch.The next segment, called The Wrong Man, written and directed by Alexander Rockwell, is equally as bad, if not worse (it's a tough call) as the first. Ted walks into a room with a manic depressive lunatic who holds his wife at gun point to test her fidelity. Ted becomes the middle man, with no where to run and nowhere to hide.Robert Rodriguez writes and directs the film's best part, though that's not saying a whole lot. It's called The Misbehavers and features Rodriguez's Desperado actor Antonia Banderas. He leads his rich, fancy family to the hotel, then abandons his two chaotic children to spend New Year's Eve with his lovely wife. He pays Ted five-hundred dollars to baby-sit them for a few hours. After a predictable hell breaks loose, Ted concludes this situation with the following reflection There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuck in the springs of the bed. There's rooms blazing afire. There's a big fat needle from God knows where, stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what. And finally there's me, walking out the door, right f*cking now. Buenas noches.The Man from Hollywood is the film's finale, by Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino himself stars as an obnoxious Hollywood star who rents a suite with his bizarre arrangement of friends, including Bruce Willis as a man with marital difficulties. By the time Ted walks in, they're drunk and doing a replay of an old Alfred Hitchcock TV episode where a man bets he can light his lighter 10 times in a row. If he loses, he also loses his pinkie finger. This episode probably holds the record for containing the most four letter words in twenty minutes.Four Rooms has reportedly been substantially cut since its disastrous September 1995 screening at the Toronto Film Festival, but it's hard to imagine the film running any longer. The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good. The film has a lot of energy, a cute little theme song and opening credit sequence, and Tim Roth is hard at work here, quirky and full of life. But he is all by himself, not supported by the writing--there are problems within his character. The key to a movie like this is to keep the connecting character consistent through his experiences.However, Four Rooms changes him from meek and timid to explosively reactive. It's hard to laugh at jokes about abnormalities when the main character is almost deranged himself.The four film's connect well, and I kind of liked some of the material in the closing segments, including the performances by Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino. But even here the situation is disposable and the dialogue is all over the wall. Four Rooms keeps us stuck in a series of stories that are not funny, entertaining, or engaging, but lackluster and deprived.The film was released on Christmas Day, which really amazes me. This movie is R-rated and intended for adult audiences only, containing everything from plotless nudity to streaming vulgarisms. Most movies released on this family-oriented holiday are, well, somewhat tactful, but not Four Rooms. The sheer nerve of the studio to release the film on December 25th should in itself be a good sign of its audacity. Consider yourself warned.

I really like Tim Roth, normally, but his character actually made me angry, he was so irritating and slapstick that I wanted him to get killed in some horrendous way, something I never wish for the protagonist of a film. Actually he didn't annoy me throughout entirely, when he didn't speak in that stupid idiot voice he was OK, the rest of the time he was Peewee Hermin.This is just my opinion and is of course subject to change as maybe if I watched it again at the right time and in the right mood I may see something I missed and get what all the people who enjoyed the movie got.

It is difficult to get into, but once the viewer gets into it, it is a funny, disturbing, and unique film. The plot is basically of a bellboy(played by the always good, Tim Roth) who has to take care of a hotel for the night on New Years Eve. He gets involved in some strange and off-color characters and slowly is driven insane by it all. There are four stories total. he first one is about a coven of witches who must find semen for their magic potion to resurrect a model. The second is about a suspicious husband who ties his wife up and holds a gun to the bellboy's face because he thinks she is cheating on him with the bellboy, only the bellboy soon discovers that this is just a weird trick. The third story(and by for the goriest) is about a rich man and his wife leaving his children alone at the hotel with the bellboy to babysit. And the forth is about a macabre bet involving a bunch of Hollywood yuppies, a car, a lighter, and removal of body parts.The first story is really only for certain audiences. I didn't dig it, but I could see why certain people may. The jokes about sex and possible incest were tiresome, the witches were stereotypes and were poor ones, and the camera angles were terrible never allowing the audience to really get into the story. The reason why is because it is shown at a fly-on-the-wall distance and for a plot involving witches it helps to know what they are up to in a closer way. Normally this cinematic approach would work well, most noticeably the brilliant Peter Greenway film, THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER, which the movie strongly reminded me of for some reason and Tim Roth was also in it.The second story was very perverse but didn't offer any way to involve the viewer in actually finding it interesting which it should have been. There is a sequence in which Tim Roth is put to inane stunt-work where he must get himself back into the apartment, even though he is falling out of it through the window. The stunt seems misguided and out of place in the drama of this story. The ideas are good, but the execution didn't quite work. Some pretty strange intensity by Jennifer Beals here.The film takes a large jump forward into sharp comedy and independent ideas. The tone was mean-spirited and wicked. The children were appropriately mischievous and the father(Antonio Banderes) was nuts. The camera work was involving, and the comedic notes were hit correctly. The story worked and the viewer will have it stuck in their minds for days if they can't make it to the next story.The best of the four is the last one, with quick and sensible dialog, an inspired plot, appropriate acting, and an off-kilter ending that is shocking, brutal, and brilliant.Rated R for pervasive strong language, sexuality and some drug use.

But, in the Misbehavors(most disgusting, disturbing thing I've ever seen)he was angry and yelling at the kids and when he saw the dead hooker in the bed he threw up and almost made me.

It was like some creepy remote hotel where there was only Ted and the people in the four rooms but it was actually in L.A where there would be many other hotel staff and you would see some guests. He was totally alone except for the significant characters and I found it strange and irritating. They had Antonio Banderas, Selma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino(hope I'm not forgetting anyone) but the movie still managed to be worse than dirt. The actors were horrible, even Banderas, Hayek and Tarantino and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment since Underworld.

Bad special effects, bad acting, stupid plot and I really couldn't stand that annoying Tim Roth. O My God! When that story ended, I didn't think things could get any worse. Too bad it did. The second story, by Alexandre Rockwell was even worse. It looked like the actors didn't even have a script and I'm still wondering if that chapter was meant to be funny or what.

Still I was pretty disappointed with the third story. Sure, it was way better than the first two stories, but there would be no way anyone could have done worse. The story was fun at some points, but overall the thing wasn't funny and the acting was still horrible.And then the fourth story, by the legendary Tarantino. There are allot of people who give this film 10 stars just for the name Tarantino, because I really doubt people actually saw this. The idea was OK, but all Tarantino does in this story is show us some of his so called cool quotes and one-liners. And while allot of people actually think these quotes and one-liners are cool and therefor the movie is great, I think they were pretty lame. And last but not least, why the hell would Tarantino cast himself in the lead? Doesn't he realize he's a terrible actor? Doesn't he realize he's ruining his own movies by giving himself a pretty important role? You have enough money, don't you Quent? So hire yourself some actors!!So overall, I really don't see why people hate the first two, but love the last two? Just because the last two directors are famous and popular?

Seeing as how multiple directors come together to create a project, if often gets people curious as to how each director's individual style meshes with the others, and what the finished film is like because of that. Sadly, most of the time, anthology films fail miserably, as the styles of each director are too different from one another to truly gel, meaning that while there may be standout parts here and there, they often don't work as complete films. Four Rooms unfortunately is one of the prime examples of this. While nowhere near as bad its initial hostile critical reaction would have you believe, the film is still very problematic.The story is that Ted the Bellhop is asked to look after a hotel during New Year's Eve and while there has to deal with multiple situations including a convent of witches, a hostage situation involving an angry husband, babysitting for a gangster's children & a bunch of drunken Hollywood stars and directors having a very dangerous bet. That is the basic story of the film, with four segments in the film directed by a different person for each. Connecting these stories is Ted the Bellhop, who is one of the film's major problems. Tim Roth delivers one of his worst performances to date as Ted, hamming it up every chance he gets, and gets annoying rather quickly. While the film is a comedy, it isn't as wacky or as farcical as Roth plays it, lacking the restraint and subtly that all the other actors have, which clearly shows that he wasn't well directed, acting like something out of Fawlty Towers, and considering the seriousness of some scenes, feels widely out of place. All of this makes Ted not only not funny, but very annoying and hard to care for, and you'll wish for him to go away as soon as possible.Each story varies in quality, although none of them are better than decent. The first one is The Missing Ingredient (directed by Allison Anders), whereby Ted has to have sex with a witch in order to create the ingredient needed in order to reverse the spell put on the coven's goddess Diana 40 years prior. It's about as ridiculous as it sounds. While it may appeal to some art-house fans, it is very corny, silly and cheesy. It is watchable though, acted well enough (Roth being the exception) and has a quirky charm to it that keeps you entertained throughout.The second segment is The Wrong Man (directed by Alexandre Rockwell), and is honestly the worst segment of this film by a country mile. I'll go as far as to say it is one of the worst things ever put on a cinema screen. It consists of Roth going into the wrong room for delivery service and encounters an angry husband with a gun, and believes Ted to be the one who slept with his wife. Everyone acts way over-the-top in a non-comedic scenario (making the piece tonally confused), has multiple plot holes (Why does the angry husband go into the bathroom during a hostage situation, giving Ted the perfect opportunity to free his wife or call the police? Why doesn't Ted take advantage of this either, or after he leaves for that matter? Why does the wife mock and taunt her angry gun-wielding husband?) and has some forced ambiguity about the husband's homosexuality that is never explored. It is frankly unwatchable, and considering that Rockwell was the one who had the idea for the film in the first place, leads me to believe that he made a terrible film, knew it and dragged in the other directors to make other segments to hope no-one would notice it. Sadly, they did and it is no wonder that Rockwell hasn't worked much since the film came out.The other two are the closet thing this film gets to decent. The Misbehavers (directed by Robert Rodriguez) is about Ted looking after some gangster's kids, with the instruction of not letting them misbehave. They do, and what follows maybe a one-joke skit, but it is quite funny, and the child actors are very good (Roth is thankfully restrained). It's unpleasantness towards the end (a dead hooker being found for example) may stop it from becoming great, but this is the best segment and it's punchline is priceless.The final segment is The Man from Hollywood (directed by Quentin Tarantino), whereby Ted goes to a room of famous Hollywood actors and directors playing a drunken bet to chop off someone's finger for a $1,000 and Ted gets involved in the process. While funny and well acted, this is the most pointless segment in the film as it builds up to the bet and then just ends very aburptly, as if nothing happened. Yeah, no negative psychological side effects can come from chopping off from someone's finger. Makes sense to me.Overall, this is just a failed experiment whose segments are widely uneven in terms of quality, the film is really smug at points and the thing connecting them together is really irritating and hard to care for. All of this combined makes this film something which while OK and not as bad as the critics at time would have you believe, isn't very good and it's no wonder why everyone involved has been actively trying to forget it ever happened. Sadly, it does and stands as a strong example as to why anthology film often don't work, as despite the talent behind camera, you often get overcooked messes like this. For curiosity's sake only.

Tim Roth is to carry this film, and he really does get on your nerves, and even though he acts absurdly, over the top, off the wall, in a totally unrealistic (well, he's not the only one) character, it's what the role calls for, and in that context, he succeeds brilliantly. Watching him lose it, was the strongest moments. It's New Years Eve, and being the new bell boy, like the Gekko Brothers at The Titty Twister, Ted (don't call him Theodore) (Roth) he's got one hell of a night ahead of him. Lets start with the covern (not oven) of witches, where we get to see Ione's Skye's slightly pathetic boobs. A ceremony of bologne is in in the waiting. This is the weakest one of the four stories. Things get weirder and much more intense, as we move onto the lover's quarrel, where poor Ted as just having pashed Ione Skye, hits more serious waters, unwittingly getting in the middle, of this mad couple problems of infidelity, where the husband holds Teddy at gunpoint. Finally surviving these two nutjobs, where we do have a second serve from one of them (the less threatening) later on, we move onto The Misbehavers which provide a bizarre and stylishly different scenario, I liked, where finally we come to the main story we've all been waiting for, about a director, played by.... have a guess? and his entourage, who really set a good example of what stupid things people do, when they're drunk, minus a pinkie. Tarantino really steals the moments here, acting not like an actor, but a director acting like a director with a lot of CU shots, where his presence holds are complete attention. He's eloquent and his body language is fantastic. I just love watching him trying to act, but he's just being him, comparing movie's what not. He shows up the other writers with his input of dialogue, though of course, more suited behind a camera, despite his awesome confidence in front of it. Yes, that was the worst club sandwich I've ever seen too. Four Rooms is certainly different with same truly impressive performances, which I will note because they deserve credit, beside Roth who's wonderful of course.

With a different director behind the wheel for each chapter, it shouldn't come as much surprise to hear this is an uneven tale that never settles on a firm identity for itself. The underlying theme is light slapstick suspense with a vibrant collection of supporting players, but each act also has its share of dark secrets and sinister overtones. The first two portions are colorful, but too thin for my taste. It seems like both had a solid beginning and ending in mind, and only set about painting by numbers to bring the two together. It's Robert Rodriguez's third act and Quentin Tarantino's closer, though, that drew me to the show anyway. Both serve as bite-sized capsules of both the best and worst traits and habits that have come to define each director. Rodriguez's arc, which naturally features both Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayeck (albeit in short cameos) is a middle ground of sorts between Spy Kids and Planet Terror. It's part kid-focused mayhem and part pulpy, black, gross-out trauma; an enthusiastic, if shallow, ride. Tarantino's adventurous final chapter is more dialog driven, with the director (of course) playing the leading role. Like a caricature of himself, he spends a good ninety percent of the scene spewing pop culture references and jazzy one-liners before the whole drama culminates in a jolting, blunt burst of adrenaline. Overall, Four Rooms is a mixed bag, and apart from the Tarantino chapter, none of the acts stand up particularly well. While fans of the director will no doubt love Quentin's arc, it's short enough that it would probably be just as easily - and effectively - viewed on YouTube or Vimeo.

This fact almost destroys Four Rooms, an anthology seemingly organized by Tarantino picking some of his favourite up-and-comers of his generation at the time. Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell has since faded into obscurity, but two of the directors on the bill, El Mariachi's Robert Rodriguez and the man himself, Quentin Tarantino, are now two of my personal favourite working directors. Four Rooms has too many weaknesses to fully recommend, but the final two segments almost fully redeem it.The stories are mostly unconnected, save the presence of Tim Roth's Ted the bellhop character. As such, each segment should be reviewed individually.The movie opens with Anders' The Missing Ingredient. A coven of witches convene in the honeymoon suite with a cauldron and nudity at their disposal, attempting to revive a fallen comrade. When one of them fails to obtain their sacrifice of semen, she must get it from the only man in sight...the bellhop.This segment is by all means godawful. The only good thing I can even say about it is that it makes the next one look good in comparison. Ione Sky as the main witch has that girl-next-door look to her essential to her role, and is perhaps the only good thing about the segment. Madonna has a nothing role with an annoying goth daughter, who seems like she should have had a more important role but is instead throwaway. Of the other witches, only Lili Taylor is memorable in any way. The effects used are right out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and don't fit at all with the rest of the film. If you ignore this segment, the movie is likely all the better for it.Rockwell's piece, The Wrong Man, has a very interesting setup, but fails to be consistent. Ted is given the wrong room number to deliver ice to, and ends up in the hands a gun-toting jealous husband (an excellent David Proval), who has his wife gagged up and is smoking out the man named Theodore she's been sleeping with.The segment definitely has its moments, such as Ted yelling for help out of a bathroom window or Proval's gun-waving antics, but it digresses a little too much. A heart attack twist at the end is a major groaner, and Tim Roth hams it up far too much in his role here. The music is also quite horribly used. Not nearly as bad as the first part, but The Wrong Man doesn't add much to the movie.The saving grace comes in Rodriguez's The Misbehavers, the direct precursor to Spy Kids. A smooth Spanish thug (a hilarious Antonio Banderas) wishes to attend a party with his wife, and pays Ted $500 to keep an eye on his children and make sure they don't misbehave. Through Vapo-Rub and dead bodies, of all things, Ted has his work cut out for him.The Misbehavers is actually the high point of the entire film. The ending is simply hilarious, the setup is very well detailed. And, unlike the cleaner Spy Kids movies, its pretty damn dark. Banderas is absolutely excellent, as are the children.This leads to the final story, Tarantino's The Man from Hollywood. Fed up with the crazy night, Ted calls his boss and complains that he's quitting. A call comes in from the penthouse, and he is convinced by her that he must fill their request, as an important customer from Hollywood is staying there. Ted caves and finds himself in the middle of one of the most eccentric bets straight out of Hitchcock.While not as memorable as The Misbehavors, Tarantino's bit is very entertaining. It has that traditional Tarantino swagger. Tarantino himself plays the man from Hollywood, making the dialogue a little more annoying but at the same time all the more stylish. Marisa Tomei is excellent in her short role. And Bruce Willis has a cameo. Whats not the love? The ending is simply amazing as well.The only thing left to address is Tim Roth, the most uneven part of the whole picture. As the only character in all stories, being under four different directors must be difficult to maintain consistency. As such, Tim Roth gives us two horrible performances (The Missing Ingredient and The Wrong Man), one brilliant one (The Misbehavors) and one very strong one (Man from Hollywood). While his 50s-sitcom performance in Missing Ingredient fits in with the general badness of that segment, his performance is arguably the worst part of The Wrong Man. His timing in The Misbehavors is the stuff of legend, as is his role at the end of Man from Hollywood.If you switch on halfway through, Four Rooms is a delightful little hodgepodge movie. Its a shame two poor segments distract from that. For simplicity, here's all four rated individuallyThe Missing Ingredient 10% The Wrong Man 30% The Misbehavors 90% The Man from Hollywood 85%At least you leave it feeling good, despite sitting through some drudge at first.

Hence the title of the movie. Anyway, he gives away something in the first room with witches and gets a little tied up in the second room. By the time he gets done with some kids in the third room he has really lost his cool and wants to quit. But there is a fourth room and once Ted has left, his frustration is gone. Ted is then on his geeky little way.It's a cute little movie and I think that I like the third room the best because it really takes Ted from a polite bellhop to a screaming mad man. He's keeping his cool throughout the movie until the boy and girl push his limits of sanity. By that point hospitality is out the window and he turns into who he really his.

Looking at the credits the usual gang are all listed- Tarantino, Rodriguez, Bender, Banderas, Roth....As the name might suggest after a brief intro the film is split into four stories (each in a different room). The stories act independently of each other, although if you watch/listen carefully you should be able to spot how they interlink, (for instance; a background phone call made during the misbehaver's). The character who moves between all the stories is played by Tim Roth; The Bellhop. Roth is working on New years eve in the hotel as the bellhop. Throughout the night for one reason or another Roth is called into each of the four rooms and so each story begins. If you are a fan of films which usually involve Tarantino, Rodriguez and Bender, or if you just like to see something refreshing and different once in a while then you will like this. If on the other hand you need great special effects, and actors who can't act, then you probably won't enjoy 'Four Rooms'The dialogue is pretty intelligent, and the acting is excellent, although perhaps not to everyone's taste. Tim Roths character seems to be a bit of a tribute to The Bell Boy which is mentioned in the film (in true Tarantino style, who usually references other films in his own). Tim Roth is bang on as the Bellhop and I couldn't think of anyone better to play the role.The hardest part for me, was deciding which story I liked the best. The first was light hearted and hilarious. Admittedly I didn't enjoy the second story as much, it was a little slow. The style reminded me of the cut scene from Pulp Fiction with Esmeralda and Butch after the fight - it was interesting, good, but slowed the whole film down. The third story was much more attention grabbing and constantly had me cringing waiting for the worst to happen. The final story was witty, pretty fast moving, and when the purpose of Tarantino's bet is revealed you find yourself moving closer to the edge of your seat until the credits role.Favourite bits- The cheeky dialogue in the first story (The missing ingredient) Roth telling the misbehaver's how his baby sitter used to make sure he stayed in bed with his eyes closed. Tarantino's bet and the final conclusion!

It also has some really annoying animated effects. Not a good thing to open with, perhaps it's done to lower expectations or something. The second story turns out to be pretty good (by comparison at least), it's really entertaining and has a good twist to it. It makes no sense that the bellboy would get to the wrong room given the lights on his control panel, but that's just details. Then come the parts the audience showed up for, the ones directed by people they've ever heard of. Robert Rodriguez gives us a rather good segment, which gets better towards the ending. Nothing special though, decent and nothing more. Tarantino's is by far the best segment, and involves some of his typical situation comedy and dialogues. The outcome is also brilliant and unexpected.

He meets all of sorts odd-balls in that unforgettable, strangle night for better or worse.This is actually a compilation of four short films are linked by the point of view of Ted. This could have been first-rate but sadly it's not. At times, it's embarrassingly unfunny and wastes a talented cast. But it's not a total waste of time, thanks to the last two tales.The first story The Missing Ingredient is the worst, Written and Directed by Allison Andres (Gas Food Lodging, Grace to my Heart, Mi Vida Loca). It's about a coven of witches (Sammi Davis, Amanda deCadent, Valeria Golino, Madonna, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor & Alicia Witt) are trying to resurrected an wrongly accused beautiful witch from the pass. These witches have everything but a man's sperm to make it work! One of the witches tries to seduced Ted before it's too late.The second story The Wrong Man is merely OK, Written and Directed by Alexandre Rockwell (In the Soup). Ted accidentally goes to the wrong room to bring ice, where a mysterious man (David Proval) holds him at gunpoint... thinking he has seduced his attractive wife (Jennifer Beals).The third story The Mishehavers is actually the best. Written and Directed by Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids Trilogy, The Faculty, Sin City). Ted decides to babysit two spoiled kids (Tomlyn Tomita and Danny Verduzco) for $300 for a rich paranoid man (Antonio Banderas) and his wife (Lana Mc Kissack). Ted has to check every half-hour in their room if they don 't misbehaved but there's strange smell in that room that becomes stronger by the minute.The fourth story The Man from Hollywood is actually pretty good. Written and Directed by Oscar-Winner Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs). Ted is called for the biggest suite in the hotel to served some strange people (Jennifer Beals, Paul Calderon and uncredited Bruce Willis) and a hot tempered Hollywood director (Tarantino) but they dare Ted to play a dangerous game for quick cash.Roth's performance is different in all four tales but he's way over the top in the first two stories. His comedic performances worked best in the last two stories. First story, despite attractive ladies... it is really boring and inane. Second story is watchable for the wrong reasons, although is amusing to see Beals talking dirty in some scenes. Third story is nearly perfect, everything works in this morbid tale. Black comedy is dead-on and so are the performances. Fourth story is fun to watch Tarantino, who was on top of the world for film-making in the 1990's and it ends with a great gag.Four Rooms is a curio to say the least. Back in the Christmas Season of 1995, when it was released by Miramax Films were expecting an box office success but instead it turned to a independent feature flop. Die Hard filmmakers fans of Anders, Rockwell, Rodriguez and Tarantino will be more kind to this very flawed feature. if you are truly curious, skip the first two stories by watching the last two segments by Rodriguez and Tarantino. Because you won't miss anything at all. Roth's performance is truly a mixed bag and so is this movie. Watch closely for Salma Hayek in the third tale and some familiar faces in between the segments.

However, Four Rooms is, improbably, one of the best to employ this approach, despite the marked differences between most of the directors involved. Allison Anders is known mostly for her television work, Quentin Tarantino tends to recycle the same violent and absurdist formula over and over - but he does it well enough, Rodrigues has made some of the most brilliant action/comedies I have seen, and Alexandre Frank is more of a writer than a director - and has made about as many films as Tarantino makes in a couple of years over the last twenty years.Remarkably, Tim Roth, and the nicely focused setting and theme, allow this odd little film to hold together nicely. Roth plays a nervous and jerky and not terribly bright new bellhop in an aging Hollywood hotel, who is about to learn some hard lessons. He gets some advice from the old bellhop he is replacing in the first scene and then begins what might be the most challenging night in anybody's life. First, he is drawn into a coven of witches who are trying to ritually resurrect a woman who died in their hotel room 50 years ago. Then he plays a psycho-sexual game of cat and mouse with a woman in bondage and a gun wielding maniac reminiscent of Dennis Hopper's Frank in Blue Velvet. From this, he goes to a highly profitable gig babysitting the children of jet-setters Antonio Banderas and Lana McKissack, who- though they are just fun-loving smart little kids - make the Addams Family look like the Brady Bunch. Finally, he is sucked into a very dangerous game with Tarantino - a drunken, rich, Hollywood star and his obnoxious, drunken cronies.All of the segments are about equally entertaining, though Rodrigues' was my clear favorite for its cleverness, mythic qualities, and slapstick. The directing and writing are solid, and Tarantino's piece is better-scripted than some of his more popular works.The cinematography is all fairly good, and emphasizes Roth's weirdness very well.Roth's performance is way over-the-top, which seems very appropriate by the time you get about halfway through the film. I was never aware of his physical acting talent, but this film showcases it well. At times, he seems to channel some of the great slapstick artists - especially Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. Nice work Mr. Roth! Recommended for fans of the directors, fans of off-beat comedy, and people looking for absurdity mixed with just a dash of disturbance.

Relieving the old bellhop who'd worked there for fifty years, Ted is given sage advice that eventually falls apart on him (mostly related to sex, accountability, and keeping one's own council.) The first episode is entitled The Missing Ingredient. A clutch of witches inhabits a hotel room and they try to stir up incantations to revive a lost sexual sisters. Sammi Davis, Amanda De Cadenet, Valeria Golino, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, and sex-pot Madonna round out the cast here. All of the witches brings a required item to the resurrection ceremony ...except one. She forgot to bring the sperm of a young man to add to their concoction. Enter Ted the Bellhop who finds his manliness much in need. This was the weakest of the four stories, failing to develop the tale or any of its characters, thus making the entire thing fall flat on its cinematic butt (even though there were plenty of nice butts and boobs in it). SEX AND THE CITY director Allison Anders misses his mark.The next episode is The Wrong Man. Sigfried (David Proval) and his wife Angela (Jennifer Beals) are having an interesting New Year's Eve playing a rather kinky game of tie-up-the-wife- and-see-what-happens. Ted is brought into their midst and the sparks start to fizzle. Is Sigfried gay? Is Angela psychotic? Funny thanks to David Proval's history as a film bad-guy, this one had potential thanks to director Alexandre Rockwell.The third installment is The Misbehavers. A husband and wife played by Antonio Banderas (TAKE THE LEAD) and Tamlyn Tomita plan to spend a romantic evening out but have to take their two misbehaving kids with them. Or do they? Enter Ted the Bellhop again. They hire him to watch over the boy and girl while they're away. Porno channels, a dirty syringe, flames, and a dead hooker all await the husband and wife upon their return. More of a slapschtick homage to The Keystone Cops, this over-the-top episode was directed by SIN CITY director Robert Rodriguez &#151; who loves to direct Antonio Banderas (they worked together on El Mariachi and Desperado.) Probably one of the more laugh-out-loud endings of the four.The final short is The Man From Hollywood directed by and starring Quentin Tarantino (KILL BILL). At the end of his shift as well as his wits, Ted is summoned to the penthouse suite where he gets involved with a wager between two very drunk Hollywood types. Norman (Paul Calderon) and Chester Rush (Tarantino) have a bet going that Norman can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row without it failing. If Norman succeeds, he'll get Chester's cherry and expensive car. If he doesn't, Norm will lose a finger. But none of his friends in the room want to be responsible for doing hacking it off should Norman lose the bet. Enter Ted again. Offered a large stack of $100 bills if he'll do it, Ted numbly picks up a meat clever and...But we won't give away the ending.Seeming more like a pet project than anything of note, this 1995 offering is entertaining but sorely bland. The Jerry Lewis antics of Tim Roth are admirable (Lewis also starred in a film entitled THE BELLBOY, 1960) but the homage to comedy of days gone by felt forced or missing.There are still laughs to be found but don't expect too many chuckles.

Not surprisingly, they were Quentin Tarantino's and Robert Rodriquez's. The Misbehaviors was freaking hilarious in all aspects (especially when the find the dead hooker in the bed and Tim Roth pukes while screaming... couldn't stop laughing), and The Man From Hollywood was funny and intriguing enough to always listen for what happens next.

I actually bought the soundtrack for the song Vertigogo, but there are many more good ones on there too.Overall, this movie is half good, half bad, but the entire cast, the soundtrack, and the overall strangeness of the film bump it up to a solid 7.

"},{"Title":"Two rooms are good, one mediocre, and one super cheesy.","Date":"26 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" The entire movie takes place on New Years Eve and New Years Morning. It consists of four major story lines that take place one after another in four separate rooms with some in-betweens to tie them all together. The character that connects the four stories is Ted the Bellhop who's a main character in each story, played by Tim Roth. Each of the four story lines has it's own writer/director. Tarantino puts his writing and directing genius at work on the finale scene, (the fourth room). Robert Rodriguez has the funniest and possibly the best and most memorable scene that has Ted having to babysit a couple of misbehavers while the parents are out on the town. The way the movie starts out, with the first two stories (or rooms), might make you want to turn the movie off. But, don't. It's worth getting to Rodriguez and Tarantino's cappers and Tim Roth's performance should keep you busy for the first half.

The stories are very different from each other and you can recognize the typical styles of the directors. Tim Roth plays his part brilliantly, being a kind of clumsy piccolo with a British accent when he's angry. His character fits perfectly in all of the stories. The rest of the cast is also quite good. I loved Madonna as the sleazy bitch she played, which is off course how she got famous in her early years. And, I was actually surprised to see Bruce Willis in the small role he played. Although the movie seems a bit of a b-movie now and then, it's just so much fun! I really love it!

There was also another part of this movie, in which Ted (the Bellhop) calls some woman on the telephone and summarizes the movie up until that point in a mildly comedic manner. I choose to ignore that part since it serves no purpose.The first story in the first room in this movie was terrible (except there was some joke about lesbian incest involving Madonna, and the bellhop's subtle reaction is hilarious), and I can't even remember the details of the second because it was so bad. After these it gets awesome.During the third room part, I was laughing almost incessantly. It was brilliant. The kids were just hilarious, throughout. In the last skit, the typical Tarantino style was evident and it was very enjoyable, almost at the level of Pulp Fiction.So, I would recommend renting this movie, and skipping past the first half. There is a bit of a crossover between the second and fourth rooms, but it's not really important.

The direction, as usual for Tarantino, was absolutely perfect, and I suppose that is what makes the scene respectable... That and Bruce Willis' appearance in the scene, which was also very good. The ending was perfect as well. But the scene itself dragged on too long, I wasn't interested all that much, and I expected a little more from something written by Tarantino. I really liked the ending though. Maybe if they cut out the first half of the scene, and just got to the point, The Man From Hollywood would have received a higher score.In all, Four Rooms is a very interesting film, but it falls short of the greatness A Band Apart has brought us. It may have fared a little better without the first scene. I like the movie, but I expected a bit more from it.

I also wanted to see why it seemed to be getting a majority of negative reviews.Roth immediately draws your attention as the bell-hop, and keeps it throughout.  His acting is definately the best part of this film, and his quirky mannerisms(the twitching fingers, and the voice which periodically lapsed into a strong cockney accent)are highlighted effectively. The film itself is impossible to judge as a whole, as the four segments, the rooms, are all completely different.The first room, 'The Missing Ingredient', was easily the worst.  The plot was insignificant, and basically the entire story was an excuse for gratuitous sex.  Tim Roth, in this case, was the only redeeming feature.The second room, though marginally better, still appeared entirely pointless, and again the writer/director's use of crude sexual references in an attempt to maintain a story became slightly disturbing.The third room was directed by Robert Rodriguez, and was significantly better than the first two.  In it, Rodriguez maintained his directorial style, and the subject matter (of two misbehaving children) comes as a great relief from the first half of the film; in fact, it would have worked much better as a short, independant of the rest of this film.  The final moments of this room (the still view of the room in its dilapidated state and Banderas' consequent question, 'Did they misbehave?') provide a final hilarious scene, and an apt ending to this part of the film.The final room was written and directed by Tarantino.  Even though I am a fan of his other films, this disappointed me.  In its own right, it wasn't bad, however it gave the appearance of serving only one purpose, as a vehicle for his ego.  Cast in the lead role of this room, Tarantino dominated throughout.  This is most obvious in the beginning, which we see from Ted's point of view, purely a close-up of Tarantino's face.  Apart from this, and the constant (and often annoying) sense of improvisation that his dialogue delivers, this was another good short of sorts, and stood out alongside Rodriguez's directing and Roth's acting as the only parts of the film worth viewing.Without the first 2 rooms 8/10 Overall 6/10               "},{"Title":"I caught most of this again last weekend...","Date":"3 June 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I have seen this film numerous times and for some reason I find it quite amusing.  I enjoy the last two rooms the best, but actually the other two are not that bad.  I did notice one thing that sticks out in my mind because it was the first time I noticed this and I need to find it on cable to confirm, but it seemed like the final room (Tarantino's) went a good 10 minutes without a single cut.  If that is the case that shot is better than any of DePalma's continuous shots or Anderson's opening sweeping shot in Boogie Nights, because it isn't one short scene with people co-mingling with the star or the camera hitting the spot and having the actors start, this was all dialogue with the director in front of the camera delivering the lines.  Given Tarantino's performance is quite wooden, but just think about that for a moment.  That is very impressive.Besides the amazing shot, Roth, Willis, and Banderas all shine with their parts.  Alicia Witt gives the lone strong performance from the opening room.  Roth carries the second room with help from Jennifer Beals.  The entire cast from room 3 is excellent with Banderas and Roth standing out.  The final room seems like a film exercise.  I am pretty sure that the shot is continuous from when Roth opens the door until they show the magazine.  Roth does his part again with help from an uncredited Willis and Beals again. This movie is almost exactly the same tone and style of Pulp Fiction, only with more cheese and I think it is great for what it is.  Those that like that style will enjoy this film, those that did not find Pulp Fiction to be funny will not.  It's that simple.

Roth is hilarious, he does on the brink of a nervous breakdown very well.  The first story is a bit slow and silly, about a coven of witches (Madonna plays a rather slinky, seductive, bitchy witch quite well--go figure).  The second story, a husband and wife play a sadistic sexual fantasy game, and the poor bellboy becomes unwillingly involved.  This story plays like pulp, and is pretty well executed.  The third story, and my personal favorite, is about two misbehaving children that the bellboy gets bribed, but sort of blackmailed into babysitting by their intimidating father, played excellently by Antonio Banderas.  This one was directed by Robert Rodriguez, and it shows.  He is wonderful at getting children to act as naturally as if they were play acting at home.  The two kids who play the misbehavers are hilarious.  The fourth and final story, directed by Quentin Tarantino, totally has the Tarantino flavor.  Roth has a large role to play in this story, and the end of it is so smoothly executed, I expected Roth to don his Reservoir Dogs black and white suit and tie and strut out of the scene. I believe the reason I found this movie so entertaining is that with 4 different directors, the mood constantly shifts.  It's pretty hard to get bored.

His character also seems to have a nervous jitter about him which will leave you laughing for ages.Next, the first segment, The Missing Ingredient - While it is funny, it's the least ammusing out of the four segments. The story of how the witches are trying to unfreeze their goddess is ammusing and the little rhyme that the witch Eva recites  Goddess Diana, fail you I will/ I was to bring you fresh sperm from my Bill/ I had him erect and his semen would follow/ Alas, I was hot, so hot that I swallowed. Therefore, obviously the other witches want eva to get sperm from Ted the bellhop. Check out for Madonna in this segment!The second segment, The Wrong Man - This segement shows Ted ending up in the wrong room, leading to having a gun pointed at his head. My favourite bit in particular from this segment was when Ted ended up half hanging out of the bathroom window squealing HELP!The third segement, The Misbehavers - This was incredibly funny. My two favourite bits from this segment was a) when the little girl made Ted realise how stupid he was when he realised that he could have washed the vapour rub off his eyelids when his babysitter used to do it to him whenhe was a child. and b) the line Ted screams down the room-service phone to the little girl that goes along the lines of, If there's not a dead body in that room by the time I get up there, I'm gonna make one!The last segment, The Man from Hollywood - I found this the funniest segment of them all.

Ted finds himself going up to the penthouse with various odd items on his room-service trolley and ends up staying there and getting mixed up in a scheme made by Quentin Tarantino and Paul Calderon. Also, look out for Bruce Willis who's there too but is uncredited. The trio are hysterical as a bunch of drunk guys on New Year's Eve.

However, if it weren't for Tim Roth's brilliant and hilarious performance, remeniscient of Jerry Lewis or Rowan Atkinson, that segment wouldn't have survived.  The second segment, The Wrong Man, had some very funny moments, with a nice reference to The Jeffersons (this is the big one, Angie!).  The Robert Rodriguez segment, The Misbehavors, is hailed as the best of all the segments.  I did find myself laughing a lot, but early in the segment it suffered slightly by an overwhelming lack of Tim Roth and an overabundance of the kids, but once Roth started getting more to do, it really picked up.  However, I found the whole speaking-through-the-barf part too disgusting to laugh at.  The humor of this segment culminated in a laugh-out-loud ending, with the perfect punch line did they misbehave?  The final segment, The Man From Hollywood, had a lot of very funny moments, and also a hilarious end, but with a lot of big stretches between laughs.

For me it is the combination of many things 1. When something TOTALLY unexplainable happens, and then either later on, or earlier on in the film, the event is triggered by something you barely noticed. Once you've seen this once, you pay much more attention to the film. And when the film is good, you'll wan't to see it all..2. The story often take the cast through some pretty extreme, sarcastic, funny situations. Like the part of Four rooms where the strict father pays the bellhop to watch the kids. Lets just say that the kids get in to a LOT of trouble as the father and mother returns..3. Realism. Now I don't mean the kind of realism like fairies don't exist, or aliens dont exist. For me, these types of elements can be included in a film, and the film will still be realistic. Realism is when you have an alien or a witch that act like they are have a bit of personality. Take the witches in the first part of the film. They have issues with each other, and thus they are not just a bunch of anonymous witches. The thing is that, that them being witches is, not the main thing. The story is, and that is where the focus is being put. Try looking at Godzilla. The story in this type of film is almost invisible compared to the effort, thats been put in to the special effects. Some may like that, but i feel the story is more important.Summed up, if you've agreed with me on the most of these things then you cannot cheat yourself of this film. Take a cab down to the nearest video shop, have the cab leave the meter on while you threaten to tear guts out of the guy at the counter, if he doesn't produce Four rooms within the next 30 seconds.

When I checked out the cast and credits at this very website, I saw the name Tim Roth and thought, Wow, he's great, but can he do COMEDY?  As it turns out, all my doubts about this movie were dispelled, but it takes a certain type of humor to be about to enjoy this movie, fortunately, the type of humor that is right up my ally.  I can see how one would not particularly care for this film, as it can be a bit crude and unconventional, but it's all in good fun.  Keep that in mind.First of all, the acting throughout this entire movie is absolutely phenomenal, featuring all well-accomplished Hollywood names.  The cast, lead by the ever-talented Tim Roth as Ted the Bellhop, brings to life some of the quirkiest, craziest characters I've seen in a long time.  Another aspect that makes this film unique is that it was compiled from the talents and visions of four people, each of whom wrote and directed on of the four segments that make up this wonderfully continual plot.  I thought I'd be in for a garbled, incoherent mess, but it flowed beautifully.A simplified version of the plot would be as follows Roth portrays Ted the Bellhop, a new employee at a small-time hotel with some rather unusual guests within.  We follow Ted into four such rooms and into the lives of some wild, wacky people.  I wouldn't want to give away much more than that because I want you to go out and see it for yourself.  If you can just sit back and not overanalyze, you'll discover it will introduce you to a sensational kind of comedy.  Please let me repeat this, for I cannot stress it enough this movie is all about fun, and nothing is to be taken too seriously.  I wouldn't exactly call Four Rooms filmmaking at it's best or anything, but it sure makes for a lot of fun and laughs. All in all, I give it an 8 1/2 out of 10.  Enjoy.

Robert Rodriguez has an undeniable gift for comedy and for working with children and Antonio Banderas steals the show as the overly macho father with plenty of dough to throw around.  The last segment is decent but not nearly as good as what one might ordinarily expect from Tarantino.  Even Tim Roth, who is usually brilliant is annoying and over-acts throughout the entire movie.

It starts off weak, gets better to the end. However, if you notice, in the last segment, as the camera pans around the room keeping its central focus on Quentin Tarentino, the background does not correspond to reality (unless it is an eight-sided room!) It made me very dizzy, and the Marinol is for nausea! A minor criticism for a movie which I will watch again to get the nuances I missed the first time through. I think this is one of those movies you should watch more than once to get the stuff you missed the first time around.

Madonna, Ione Skye, Alicia Witt and others play a coven of witches trying to bring a goddess back to life. They need a missing ingredient from Ted. Antonio Banderas (Mask of Zorro, 13th Warrior) and Tamlyn Tomita (Kumiko, from Karate Kid, Part II) are a couple of parents that just want to have a night out without the kids.

Its a study of different styles and different approach to filmmaking, but alas i failed to notice any significant difference. all the 4 short films had loud, physical comedy, raser thin, situational plots.As it has already been told by other reviewers, you can skip the 1st 2 rooms, unless you are intersted in topless witches, chanting sometimes funny, but mostly nonsense rhymes. the 1st room hardly has any plot, and it ends abruptly. the 2nd room is even worse. i liked the camera work and Jennifer's performance though. the 3rd room is essentially what gets your money's worth. This is the only story which appeals to an unbiased audience. but if you are a Tarantino fan, you might like the 4th room more. 'The Misbehavors', that's the name of the 3rd short by Robert Rodriguz, has everything you need to make movie going enjoyable. well defined plot, very good acting by Antonio Banderras and specially the kids, good camera work and a real climax, which the first 2 stories never had. its charming, its witty. but the same can not be said about 'The man from Hollywood', QT's take.almost half-an hour wait for a 5sec punchline is not worth it. QT does show some of his raw style with the long takes, and mostly impromtu dialogues, but the plot moves along very slowly, and except for the last few minutes, the dialogues are not witty at all, a trademark of all QT movies.

Antonio Banderas, Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino deliver great performances.   Many believe that Tarantino`s work is completely original, but it isn`t.

Fast forward it to about 45 minutes into the movie and watch from there. You won't miss a single important thing and you'll thank me later. Unfortunately I was never given that guidance when I first rented this movie. The only reason I sat through the first two stories was my complete lack of anything better to do... that and I knew Quentin wouldn't let me down.  The first two stories are unbearable, but after you've sat through them you're well rewarded by the hilarious second half of the movie. Also I've got to say the soundtrack is awesome. It fits perfectly with the mood of the movie. And finally a note about Tim Roth. His performance was spectacular! I never knew the guy could be so hilarious! For anyone who says he was ripping off any other actors, it's called a role. He played a role and did a damn good job at it too! He, by far, carried this movie through its horrid first two acts.

The first, about a coven of sexual witches, seems more like a naughty 1940s cartoon, and it seems Anders was thinking more of a pornographic Looney Tunes Episode when she wrote this one. The next segment, The Wrong Man, was simply disappointing. A maniacal man named Siegfried ties up his wife, holds Ted the Bellboy as a hostage, and then bounces around, not making much sense. When it was over, I wasn't sure what exactly had happened -- was it actually just all a game? Did someone really sleep with Siegfried's wife or what? And hearing so many names for the male penis... Frankly, I could have heard that at a high school. Not what I call entertaining. After that, there was The Misbehavers, where Ted has to babysit a Mexican gangster's pair of children. I sort of liked this one, because it was so absurd, and the ending -- while it might seem a little cliche -- still brings forth an earnest chuckle. Robert Rodriguez, if he had tried a little harder, could have saved the Four Rooms ship from completely sinking, but he only manages to keep it afloat a little longer. Tarantino's efforts are a little more shoddy. It's classic Tarantino, and it seems like a scene from a Tarantino movie. But the previous four segments have just ruined your viewing capability, and ruined it all for Tarantino as well. His take on The Man From Rio is downright cool, and his minute to convince is excellent. But it isn't brilliant, and so Four Rooms remains destined to fall to the bottom of movie history.

It comes across like the directors responsible were just filling in free time between their real movies - which is probably true.  Only Rodriquez's piece has any real merit.Tim Roth plays the bellboy who is the link between all the stories and subsequently the main character.  I think someone should have slapped him and told him to sort his act out.  I love Tim Roth usually but here he was just way too over-the-top.  If he had exercised a little bit of restraint, the whole film could have been improved.  Instead, his overly exaggerated mannerism's really began to test my patience.Now to the stories.  The Missing Ingredient by Allison Anders is peculiar to say the least.  Now peculiar is a good thing in my book, but after promising to be amusing this just goes nowhere .  It's just dumb.  The only thing that sustained my interest were the somewhat unnecessarily bare breasts of two to the actresses.The Wrong Man by Alexandre Rockwell unfortunately doesn't have breasts to sustain interest.  I think this is the piece most affected by Roth's overtly comic acting.  If he had played it straight, maybe, just maybe, this situation might have come out alright.  But it lacked any of the requisite tension or nervous comedy required.  Like the first story, it just comes out dumb.The Misbehaviors from Robert Rodriquez is the real standout.  If I didn't know better I would have guessed it was by the Coen brothers - which is a compliment to Rodriquez - there are obvious parallels to Barton Fink.  The climax is a simply superb culmination of black comedy and stylish camerawork. Antonio Banderas is terrific as the father of the two little 'misbehaviors'.The Man from Hollywood, while better than the first two stories, is probably the most disappointing, only because it's from Quentin Tarantino who I expected more from.  He takes the lead role himself here.  Now Quentin gets a lot of knocks for his acting, but I find that when he plays obnoxious (like in Pulp Fiction) he is fine, that's what he plays here, and he's fine. The problem is, somewhat surprisingly, in the script.  The whole thing is a purposely long winded set-up for a quick punch line at the end.  That's fine, but the set up is just too inconsistent.  At times it's entertaining, at other times it is just dumb, which typifies too much of this whole film.I'd give the film 6/10 on the whole, mostly on the strength of The Misbehaviors story alone.  Don't pay to watch it, and certainly don't expect for your life to be changed by it and you won't have a bad time.

The Anders piece has barely enough content in it to make a 30 second beer commercial, let alone a piece this long.  The second attempts some sort of Blue Velvet/After Hours bizarro episode (naive guy struggling among dangerous psychos).  Again, given the short nature of each segment, you'd think this would be pretty tight, but boy does it ramble.And Tim Roth!  Mr. Roth has been fantastic in everything else I've seen, but he's utterly unwatchable in this, and we're forced to see his twitching Tourette routine in nearly every scene of the film.

While there Ted gets involved with four Comedic,different and interconnected tales with some weird and offbeat Hotel guests on a night Ted will never forget.Released in 1995,Four Rooms is a wonderful and hilarious Comedy that was directed at the time by independent film makers such as Allison Anders(Gas Food Lodging),Alexandre Rockwell(In The Soup),Robert Rodriguez(El Mariachi,Desperado)and last but certainly not least Quentin Tarantino(Pulp Fiction,Reservoir Dogs)doing four different tales with an all-star cast. However,despite the talented names involved Four Rooms was not a Box Office success and was panned by the critics which is very unfortunate because Four Rooms is a fantastic movie that is very overlooked and better than it's reputation but at the same time Four Rooms is a film that seems to have found a small Cult audience since it's 1995 release. Four Rooms is a great movie that is just hilarious and a fun blast from start to finish giving viewers an anthology film which is usually for the Horror genre but instead of an anthology Horror film we get an anthology Comedy done in a demented style that just never stops and is the kind of movie that is perfect to watch on New Years Eve. The Comedy and laughs in Four Rooms funny, hilarious and is done with a surreal and offbeat style that is wild and insane because when you watch Four Rooms you never know what's going to happen next with some situations being surprising which is why the movie works so well. The main character Ted is funny and memorable because most of the things that happen in the film are seen from his point of view and when things get bad we are rooting for to get out of it while laughing at the insanity that happens to him from the dangerous to the very weird. We as the viewer wonder will Ted lose his cool or just explode. Four Rooms should be used as a training video(or a warning)for anyone who wants to work at a Hotel. The first story The Missing Ingredient while amusing and filled with beautiful Actresses is the weakest of the four stories because there are a few nice moments the Humor is few and far between with no real payoff. Things are much better and fun in the second story with The Wrong Man,a complete laugh fest where Ted(in a bad case of mistaken identity)is asked at gunpoint to play in a sex and hostage game with husband and wife Sigfried(David Proval)and Angela(Jennifer Beals). I think many would agree that the best segment(and my personal favorite)in the whole entire film is The Misbehavers,an hilarious and laugh a minute tale that finds Ted being paid money to look after a husband(Antonio Bandaras)and wife's(Tamlyn Tomita) two children(Lana McKissack and Danny Verduzco). Imagined if Ted had to baby sit Bart and Lisa Simpson from The Simpsons and going through a hellish situation and you get that with The Misbevavers with scenes that are funny and unpredictable with a crazy energy that is insane,wild and will have you roaring with laughter. The last segment of the film is The Man From Hollywood,a tale about a famous Hollywood director(Quentin Tarantino)who is having his own New Years Eve party and asks Ted to play in a bizarre game and bet. The Man From Hollywood in true Tarantino fashion is the most dialog filled of the four stories and like Tarantino's other movies the dialog is memorable and fun with a great conclusion. The ending of Four Rooms is amazing and Humorous with a twisted style and is a fitting ending that matches the rest of the film. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is great. Tim Roth is excellent and hilarious as Ted,The Bellhop,with Roth bringing an amazing and over the top comic energy to the film. Valeria Golino(Athena),Madonna(Elsepth),Ione Skye(Eva),Lili Taylor(Raven),Alicia Witt(Kiva),Sammi Davis(Jezebel),Amanda De Cadenet(Diana),Jennifer Beals(Angela),David Proval(Sigfried)Antonio Banderas(Man),Tamlyn Tomita(Wife),Lana McKissack(Sarah),Danny Verduzco(Juancho),Selma Hayek(TV Dancing Girl)Quentin Tarantino(Chester),Bruce Willis(Leo),Paul Caulderon(Norman),Marisa Tomei(Margaret),Kathy Griffin(Betty)and Marc Lawrence(Sam The Bellhop)give good performances as well.The direction by Ailson Anders,Alexander Rockwell,Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is amazing and memorable with each director bringing a different style and pace to the film and always moving the camera. Great direction by all of them.The score by Combustible Edison is great,amusing and quirky matching the movie's tone perfectly. Nice score,Edison.In final word,if you love Comedies,Anthology films,Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez,I highly suggest you see Four Rooms,a terrific,hilarious and underrated Comedy that is worth your time. Highly Recommended, 9.5/10.

I've heard about this one for years but never watched it because (a) the concept seemed lame and (b) the word-of-mouth on this was that it was awful. Having now watched it I can say that it does, in fact, stink.The first story, written and directed by Allison Anders, is a slight but amusing story about a coven of witches trying to perform a spell to resurrect a goddess. Each witch is responsible for bringing a certain ingredient for the spell but one witch (Ione Skye) was unable to get hers so she has one hour to get the ingredient so they can do the spell. I won't spoil what the ingredient is. You'll either laugh at it or find it childish and stupid. I chuckled so I guess I'm in the middle on the maturity scale. This was the best segment in the movie, although it ends abruptly.The second story, written and directed by Alexandre Rockwell, has Ted the bellhop delivering ice to the wrong room and being accused by the husband of having an affair with his wife (Jennifer Beals). There was something very familiar about this plot, although I can't seem to remember where I've seen it before. Anyway, it's not funny in the slightest. This is the worst of the four stories. The third story, from Robert Rodriguez, has the bellhop being paid to babysit Antonio Banderas' kids. He leaves them in the room alone with and they predictably get up to mischief. This segment isn't very funny either. It's like a more adult version of the kind of humor Rodriguez used in the Spy Kids movies.Quentin Tarantino writes, directs, and acts in the last story and this is probably why most people even watched this. Being a Tarantino fan, I was cautious about it because I've often heard this called his worst work. Quentin plays a movie director who places a bet with a friend. If the friend wins, he gets Quentin's car. If he loses, Ted the bellhop has to cut off his pinky finger. Pretty flimsy stuff. Very dialogue-heavy as you would expect from Tarantino, although nothing memorable. Quentin's acting is atrocious in this. To be fair, even a better actor wouldn't have made the crappy script work. Bruce Willis appears in this segment for free, resulting in a SAG dispute which is why he's not listed in the credits. This segment also features a ridiculous amount of F words, even for Tarantino.Overall, it's not a funny movie. Roth is very weak. He's obviously trying to be over-the-top with his comedy, like some kind of foul-mouthed Jerry Lewis. He just got on my nerves in every segment. He pulls out all of the cornball stops rubberfacing, silly voices, slapstick, and everybody's favorite last resort F bombs every other word. I didn't find him the least bit funny. There's enough of interest about the movie to at least watch it once. But it's not something I would watch again. "},{"Title":"Terrible First Half, With a Pretty Good Second Half","Date":"28 February 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I'll admit, I do have a bias towards Tarantino. I love the guy's stuff. Not a single one of his films do I dislike in the slightest. However, he has dabbled in some side projects that don't carry the full Written and Directed by... promise of, say Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, that aren't the biggest successes. But for a single segment of the four that make up Four Rooms, we have Tarantino behind the pen, the camera, and in front of the screen! It's no coincidence that his segment is actually entertaining. But I'm ahead of myself. Let me review this piece by piece.The Missing Ingredient is both the opening chapter and the worst chapter. It's terrible. A group of witches (Real witches, apparently.) are trying to reincarnate their goddess, but require several specific items, the only of which they don't have is a man's sperm. I'm not joking. So, the witch who hasn't fulfilled her part must acquire her item within the hour. It sounds like the plot of a pornographic film. It's just stupid. The witch seduces Tim Roth's Ted the Bellhop, and some silly special effects later, she has her final item. I can't tell you how much I hated this. Not once during this chapter did I crack a smile, I was just hoping the next part was better. It is, but not substantially so.The Wrong Man is the second chapter. A little more interesting and far less ridiculous, Ted the Bellhop finds himself staring down the barrel of a revolver when he accidentally enters the wrong room when responding to a call. The chaos that comes from a mistaken identity ensues, and Ted is put between a man with a gun and his gagged wife. What I found to be one of the best quotes from the movie comes up here. Something about wearing a bonnet, I can't recall it right now. Though, I felt the situation was a little hard to follow here. Maybe I wasn't really paying attention, maybe it was supposed to be convoluted. Maybe it was because Tim Roth is delivering his lines in an angry whisper the entire time.Seriously, I like Timothy Roth, he's had some great roles in some great films, but god he chose the wrong role here. Ted the Bellhop is a flamboyant, fast-talking wreck. I couldn't understand him sometimes. Maybe that's what made the movie funny but I found it annoying. It was like watching the protagonist of a kid's movie trying to get laughs from children by acting silly, but surrounded by swearing and adult themes.With the third chapter, thing get better. Perhaps it's because it focuses less on Roth's silly character. The Misbehavers is directed and written by Robert Rodriguez. In this fun little short, a tough husband and his wife leave their children in their hotel room for the evening, hiring Ted to check up on them now and then. Don't misbehave he warns. The two kids are portrayed in a funny, childish way and their innocence leads to a gruesome discovery that I won't spoil here; it's one of the few parts worth not spoiling. Rodriguez really gives us this picture of a dysfunctional family headed by a strict father-figure (Who MAY or may not be a gangster!) And this chapter ends with a great scene.The moment I'm sure many had been waiting for was Quentin Tarantino's segment The Man from Hollywood. QT stars in this segment as a drunk, rich movie star. He and his posse are drinking, having a good time. The alcohol in their system leads to them recreating a scene from a Hitchcock story where one of the men must light his lighter ten times in a row, or have his pinkie chopped off. It's really well played out here as the drunk trio of friends (And a character from a previous chapter.) move about their suite, throwing their money around like it's nothing. If you like Tarantino's writing, you'll like this segment. If not, you won't! It's classic Tarantino. Again, Roth is sort of put in the background, behind this intoxicated cast of characters. I think Roth was the problem with the movie, possibly. Or rather, Roth's character.So there. It's an interesting concept that, with four skilled directors, could have been phenomenal. But alas, the filmmakers who directed the first two chapters are unknown for a reason. I think I'd have to say Rodriguez's segment was the best. So, I give this a 6/10. Really, the second chapters are fun little shorts, and even the second one isn't all that bad. But the opening part is so unforgivable. It sets such a negative tone for the rest of the movie. And since these segments are all part of one film, they must be given a rating as one.

The introductory credits are cartoonish, insanely stupid and long. Really self-indulgent. Like they really thought they were being incredibly funny, when in actuality they only remind us of the intro bits of the Pink Panther cartoon, only much more childish.And sure enough the first of the four movies is so horribly unfunny, badly written and overacted, all I could think about it was 'Errr...' My movie-watching companion concurred. We had vacant stares upon our faces. The only decent part about the first movie were the bare tits and Madonna's cleavage. Furthermore it was mindbogglingly dumb and theatre-acting like. (Insert sound of disgust here.) 2 out of 10.The second movie same deal. Overacting, theatre-like overacting, dumb story, silly situations, unlikely and unlikeable people. Really, I was thinking how I could've spend my time even worse than looking at this crap, and nothing really popped up. Maybe intentionally breaking my leg or knowingly unhinging my jaw would be even less fun. 3 out of 10. Also, the first two directors have had no career at all after their sh^tpile contribution to Four Rooms, and rightfully so. Go do something you're good at. Theatre?Then came the third one. We weren't sure whether we had already seen the ones of Tarantino and Rodriguez, and luckily we did not. This was the Robert Rodriguez one, we quickly figured. The style, the humor, all that stuff. Also, Tim Roth, the main character was not overacting so much in this one. It's an awesomely told story about two kids left behind in a hotel on new year's eve by their parents (one of which is a really cool Antonio Banderas). With only the bellboy (Roth) to look after them. It has funny dialogue, decent acting (even by the kids) and is more realistic, and towards the end pays off in a climax that had me and my friend laughing out loud for a couple of minutes straight. Forking awesome 9 out of 10.The last one of the bunch was the one by Tarantino, which we figured when Tarantino himself was in the first scene. It's typical Tarantino, but a bit more over the top in the start and with (pretty much signature) overly long conversations (remember Kill Bill 2? Good lord...), that were not nearly as funny and well written as in say Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This one is decent as well, only it drags on and on. The pay-off though is again remarkable, having to do with a wager involving a car, a big meat-cleaver, a pinkie and drunk party guests. Too long, boring at times, but the climax saves it 7 out of 10. Thus we add up 2+3+9+7= 21. 21 divided by four 5.25, so 5 out of 10. Just skip the first two bits if you want to keep your stomach contents.

Stars Valerie Golino, Madonna, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, Sammi Davis and Amanda DeCadenet.Just horrible. This segment is my, and almost everybody's least favorite. It is about a coven of witches who try to resurrect their beloved goddess Diana by putting in different ingredients into a potion. The final ingredient is semen, and oh look, she swallowed. So they have to turn to good ol' Ted the bellboy for the missing part, and stupidity ensues. This segment plays like a porno movie with weird random nudity and a stupid plot. I know you won't, but I recommend you skip this segment. My review 2/10.Segment Two The Wrong Man Directed by Alexandre Rockwell. Stars David Proval, Jennifer Beals and Lawerence Bender.A big improvement over the last one (Which isn't saying much). This little ditty is about Ted getting a call from a drunken partier (Bender) and accidentally ending up in the wrong room, where, by coincidence, a man is waiting for someone to come and have sex with his wife also named Ted (Theodore) and this man, named Siegfried (Proval) makes Ted the bellboy play out a psycho sexual drama with his wife, Angela (Beals). Not very good, but it is stylishly directed and it has good music. Much more tolerable than the last one, but no where near good. My review 4/10.Segment Three The Misbehavers Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Stars Lana McKissack, Danny Verduzco, Antonio Banderas, Tamlyn Tomita, Salma Hayek and David Proval(voice).This is a segment I would actually classify as good. In fact, i'd say this was great. This segment is about a couple of parents (Banderas and Tomita) who need Ted to take care of their kids while they go to a party. Ted soon realizes that the kids are a couple of trouble makers, doing things like turning on dirty movies (Slama Hayek pole dancing), drinking champagne, smoking, and playing with needles. When Ted tucks them into bed they all notice a strange smell in the room. Later, the kids find a mangled corpse of a woman in the mattress, which leads to a hilarious instant barfing scene. I really love this segment, and this is truly what slapstick humor is all about. My rating 10/10.Segment Four The Man From Hollywood. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. Stars Quentin Tarantino, Paul Calderon, Bruce Willis, Jennifer Beals, Marisa Tomei and Kathy Griffin.Nothing could top the last segment, but this is a nice ending to the stories. We start off with a pre-segment where Ted explains his dilemma to a lady at his boss's house (Tomei) then his boss (Griffin) over the phone. It's pretty much just a way to stretch out the film, but it's pretty funny. Marisa Tomei has quite a few funny lines as the stoner-y woman. Now to the actual segment.....Ted goes to actor Chester Rush's room in the Penthouse Suite. Chester (Tarantino) is partying with buddies Norman (Calderon), Leo (Willis) and Angela, who was last seen tied up in segment two. They are totally wasted and they want to play out an old Hitchcock story. Normman is going to try to light his lighter ten times in a row. If he does, he gets Chester's car, but if he fails, he gets his pinkie chopped off. That's where Ted comes in...they want him to be the dice man. I did enjoy this segment, but it's too much talk, and far too little action. However this segment was successful all in all. This segment was only around 24 minutes long and managed to use the f-word 116 times. My rating 7 and a half/10.My final rating 6 out of 10. A good enough comic anthology to quench my thirst, but not enough to leave me satisfied.98 minutes. Rated R for Strong Language, Violence, Nudity, Sexual Humor and Drug Use. "},{"Title":"Slightly hilarious little gem","Date":"3 February 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I think I can understand why a lot of people dislike this movie. It's probably because all of the actors (deliberately) go way over the top, Tim Roth in particular. And also, the kind of humor used in FOUR ROOMS isn't for a wide audience. I've watched this movie for the third time recently (with a few years in between), and I still like it as much as the first time I saw it.It's about a bell-boy (Tim Roth) in a hotel who's about to have the craziest New Year's Eve of his life as he gets involved in four different stories all taking place that very same night. I've always been a fan of anthology-movies as you often get the chance to check out different talents at work (and a lot of talents were involved in this one; just check out the cast and directors). It was also a nice change to see it all happen in the comedy-genre instead of the horror-genre, which is the usual habitat for anthology stories. I'm not even gonna go into the good or (possible) bad aspects of the movie, 'cause to me this movie is a success with perhaps the second segment The Wrong Man my least favorite (but still good) and the last segment The Man From Hollywood being my absolute favorite. Instead I'm gonna give only a few of my personal high-lights (of the many) from every segment.The Missing Ingredient beautiful topless witches, kitschy cartoon-like effects,...The Wrong Man David Proval & Jennifer Beals, Ted's attempt at escaping through the bathroom window,...The Misbehaviours Antonio Banderas redefining the word 'macho', the crescendo of chaos in the climactic ending,...The Man From Hollywood Quentin Tarantino's constant verbal ramblings, a drunk Bruce Willis, the bet,...I might add that FOUR ROOMS contains, in my opinion, a lot of extremely funny dialogues and there are some nice, inventive shots in every segment which perfectly reflect modern day film-making. You can also find much references and trivia to other movies and on a last note, I think that Tim Roth, with his performance, finds that perfect balance between annoying and hilarious. So don't anybody tell me that FOUR ROOMS isn't a funny and interesting film.

The story was pretty worthless as well and the whole thing really got me thinking Am I gonna be able to keep watching Ted the bellboy for 90 minutes+? 3,5 out of 10 Segment 2 The wrong man Immediately a big improvement over the first segment and a definite step towards Robert's and Quentin's style of directing and story-telling. Upon hearing Angela's monologue (or should I say word-list) the film really started to get a Tarantino vibe and I loved it. But most importantly, the acting got a lot better here and Ted wasn't as irritating as in the first segment. Story-wise it was OK. Not very original, but there were some funny elements in it.6 out of 10 Segment 3 The misbehavers I knew this one was Rodriguez all along, for having Banderas in it and I must say I was a bit surprised with the bit at first, since it felt much more like a bit out of Dennis the Menace than anything I had expected out of Rodriguez for such a film (ALSO Spy Kids wasn't made back then you know). Nonetheless I really felt this was a fresh piece, combining Rated-R elements very well with mischievous comedy. Oh MAN!, back then Rodriguez still had it (don't blame me for not having seen Sin City yet!!!).7 out of 10 Segment 4 The man from Hollywood Judging from the quality of the last segment, the motto of this ensemble film must have been from worst to best, because with his segment, Tarantino puts the icing on the cake. The direction is top notch, the acting is good and there is a lot of tension and intensity in the room, which keeps the bit vibrant and exciting throughout. I know many Tarantino-haters will say Can't you see, this guy steals everything!. While I think Tarantino's piece in 'Four Rooms' will be the perfect aim for all their criticism, I regard his 'stealing' as inspiration, because when one is true to oneself one must admit that every story has been told before in one way or another. And if (I say IF) Tarantino is a copycat, he's a truly brilliant and original one, cause let's face it, his dialog's are one of a kind.7,5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy...","Date":"15 February 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" 'The Misbehavers' is the best part in the entire movie.

The best section is of course Quentin Tarantino's, as there is some of Tarantino's great dialouges in it...his dialouges are part of what make him so good. Anyway, a different event happens in each room, adding to the bumbling bellhop's fun filled evening. Tim Roth proves in this that he certainly can play a wide range of characters.

In fact, the incantatory rhymes of Eva the all-girl witch were one of the few good laughs in the whole four-part joint.  The next bit of absurdity, Room 404, has been done so much better elsewhere.  Jennifer Beals' acting kept me involved here, believing some actual content might emerge -- like a plot?  Her eyes promised so much!  The dialogue gave so little!  From time to time the art direction was notably okay.  Charming.  Meanwhile, wincing at every other facial maneuver Roth tries.  So, by the time we get to Rodriguez's great kids, the big ones and the little ones, a parallel of adult/child misbehaviors, Roth is hardening, yes?  He calls into the (cliche) pad of his boss, firm, resolute, quitting.  Now I'm yawning.  Yes! Yes! get this thing over with.  Just one more room (oh, dang!).  Is that Bruce Willis?

Quentin Tarantino is apparently some kind of loser that people talk about with excitement.  The shock value of being bad is something a lot of us worked through when we were pre-adolescent.

I was not familiar with Esquivel's music at the time, and I didn't know where the older music ended and the more recent music began. The music contributes heavily to a clever time-blurring mid-60's effect. Just when was this movie made? I really don't think the film as a whole intends to make any serious points about anything.

Such is the case with Four Rooms.The film opens with Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth) taking over the job of bellboy in an almost whimsical hotel on New Years Eve. The cartoonish opening credits cue in, and it all goes downhill from there. The film is made up of four different segments, each written and directed by a different person. The directors include Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriquez, and Quentin Tarantino. Each story has only one thing in common Ted the Bellhop.The first segment titled 'The Missing Ingredient,' stars Madonna and Lili Taylor (among others) as witches who are trying to resurrect their goddess from the dead. It's a very interesting promise, but goes racing downhill when they realize they need the semen from a man then enters Ted the Bellhop.To top it all off, this segment doesn't even end, it's almost as if they suddenly ran out of ideas and just stopped writing it. The whole segment makes no sense, and is such a bore to watch.The second segment titled 'The Wrong Man,' is at least a notch above the first, starring David Proval (The Sopranos, UHF) as a man who forces Ted at gunpoint to commit sexual acts with his tied-up and gagged wife. Although completely ridiculous, the segment at least features a few 'inspired' shots, and a certain ridiculous lunacy.The third segment titled 'The Misbehavers,' is the best of them all. As a matter of fact, it deserves a movie of it's own. Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn) wrote and directed this segment with such flair, and artistic ability.It features Antonio Banderas as a slick, smooth talking man who wants to take his wife out for a little fun. However, there's something that stands in the way his kids. He pays Ted the Bellhop five-hundred dollars to watch over his kids while he's gone&#133;seems pretty easy, right? Wrong. The children end up getting into alcohol, tobacco, needles, and even end up finding a dead prostitute stuffed in the mattress of their bed.It's creative and stylish, and the most fun I had during the film. I personally think that Rodriguez should have just made the entire film himself.The final segment titled 'The Man From Hollywood,' was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, the genius behind such movies as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill. Naturally, I had the highest hopes for this story, Pulp Fiction being my all-time favorite film. However, I was quite let down when Tarantino felt it necessary to parade himself around in front of the camera and whine about flat champagne.It's about a group of wasted guys who make a bet that Norman (Paul Calderon) can't ignite his Zippo lighter ten times in a row. If he misses one, then he gets one of his fingers hacked off. In comes Ted the Bellhop, who is greedily seduced into playing out their sick, twisted game.Tarantino overstays his welcome, and the ending of the segment, (which is also the end of the film) doesn't pay off for the endless minutes of blabbering we have just heard. The original idea could have been good, but Tarantino took it in completely the wrong direction.However, this segment does feature a very impressive signature long-shot from Tarantino, lasting around ten minutes. It also features Paul Calderon and an uncredited Bruce Willis.Overall, this movie was not good&#133;not good at all. I couldn't imagine myself watching it again, except for Rodriguez's bit. I'd say it's worth seeing once, especially to see Tim Roth's little strut and speaking manner.

It's a frame story where we follow the nameless Bellhop (Time Roth) through the night as he interacts with the different bizarre tenants of the hotel ranging from drunk Hollywood directors to witches.There's not much linking the different stories other than cameos from the some similar characters between sketches, a few references to previous segments and the constant presence of our nameless bellhop. Other than this, each sketch follows its own distinct style and story to give the filmmakers greater control of their own shorts. This is partly beneficial as it creates originality. But it also lacks consistency between segments, with even the character of the Bellhop's personality switching between segments. The Missing Ingredient- By far the weakest segment, it follows a Covent of witches who need to complete a ritual. However they are short of a mans semen and decide to get it from the bellhop. The entire sketch is mostly annoying from start to finish through its mixture of bad performances and dreadful writing from Alison Anders. There's not even many jokes in this segment and most of the attempts at humour were creepy. 4/10The Wrong Man- When the bellhop goes to the wrong room, a couple forces him to join in on their strange game. This time the sketch does actually have good performances with David Proval giving an enjoyably over the top performance. But unfortunately he doesn't have much to work with as just like Anders segment, Rockwell made a weak script that's light on jokes. 5/10The Misbehavers- The bellhop must look after a pair of kids, so their parent (Banderas) can have fun at a party. But every time he leaves the room they both get into more and more trouble. This is where the film becomes enjoyable and has some entertaining situation comedy moments. It's like a prototype version of Spy Kids (albeit with some adult humour thrown in) showcasing Rodriguez great flare for slapstick style comedy. It's witty, memorable and is enjoyably eventful. 6/10The Man from Hollywood- This is by far the films greatest segment. Mostly based around a Hitchcock episode by Roald Dahl, Chester Rush (Quentin Tarantino playing a parody of himself) wants the bellhop to cut off their friends finger if he loses the bet. The segment is well made with many of Tarantino's usual traits being present in the film and includes one impressive long take to open the scene. On top of this it follows a very tense build up before getting to a very enjoyable and funny pay off. 8/10It's very much a roller-coaster film, with some high points but also some low points. The first 2 segments are dull and unenjoyable. But then it does pick up for both Rodriguez and Tarantinos segments. Whilst it may not feel like it at first, the film is worth watching with some memorable and entertaining moments picking up speed as it goes.

The stories take place at an old hotel on New Year's Eve, with a bellhop named Ted (Tim Roth) acting as a link between them. Four Rooms was panned after its initial release, but has since become a minor cult item. It's an ambitious, uneven little movie - the shaggiest of dogs.Weird decisions were definitely made with the opening segments by Anders and Rockwell, particularly in the editing room. Quite a bit seems to have been left on the cutting room floor, picking up the pace but increasing the huh? factor.The Rodriguez segment is funnier and more focused. It's some of the best work of the director's career, and Antonio Banderas is fantastic as a Mexican gangster.Marisa Tomei makes a brief but priceless appearance as Margaret, a stoned but amiable New Year's reveller, and then we are launched into the main event - Tarantino's room. His story is the best of the lot. It's talky and tense and ends with a wildly funny flourish.Tim Roth is charged with holding this whole thing together, and he acquits himself just well enough. It's tough to imagine anyone else pulling off that bellhop uniform, and he provides the film with one of its most memorable images when he sashays down those hotel hallways to Combustible Edison's adorable retro-lounge soundtrack.Four Rooms will surely attract Tarantino completists and the more adventurous movie buffs among us.

It is New Years Eve in a fancy hotel and Ted the bellhop (Time Roth) is the only person on duty. He has four different adventures from four different directors. Of course having one movie with four directors is bound to have its ups and downs so the best way to review this is to pick it apart peice by peice. The first room is a boring unfunny but about witches who run around topless, next please. The second one picks up quite a bit with lots of hilarious jokes while Ted is held hostage by a man with a  big gun after he delivers ice to the wrong room. There is also a very funny bit while Ted is trying to escape from the room out the bathroom window and incounters the original guy he was supposed to take the ice to, very funny. The next room is rather annonying and extremely gross. The only funny bit is when the kids try to make a phone call to ask if any other rooms has a needle in them and they get the guy with the gun from the previous room. The last, and by far the best is directed and stars the great Quentin Tarantino. It also has a great uncredited performance from Bruce Willis. Both Willis and Tarantino and hilarious as drunk, foul mouthed ganster types, and oh boy are they ever foul mouthed. They decide to enlist in the help of Ted to play a game taken from an old episode of Hitchcock Presents.

The kids play dangerous games with sharp objects, torment the poor bellboy (Tim Roth at his comedic best) watch smut on TV (actually it's the torso of Selma Hayak doing something like the twist), and defaming a woman's corpse they find under the bed!

Often using physical comedy and sight gags, this movie chronicles the slapstick misadventures of Ted, the Bellhop. He's on his first night on the job, when he's asked to help out a coven of witches in the Honeymoon Suite. Things only get worse when he delivers ice to the wrong room and ends up in a domestic argument at a really bad time. Next, he foolishly agrees to watch a gangster's kids for him while he's away.

The Missing Ingredient is the first one by Allison Anders. Ted, a bellhop, helps a group of strange women to the honeymoon suite, where they have a large cauldron in the middle of the room in order to brew a potion to summon a goddess. They each add something to the mix, until the last witch needs to find semen within an hour to complete the potion. She works on Ted for a donation. I liked this one and give it 8/10.The Wrong Man by Alexandre Rockwell places Ted in an awkward situation in the middle of a fight between a husband and wife. Ted is accused of a sexual encounter with the lady by her husband and after Ted escapes, another guest goes through the same insanity. So so, and a 5/10.The Misbehavers by Robert Rodriguez puts Ted in the position of babysitter for two little brats. Antonio Banderas and his wife leave their boy and girl in the room and pay Ted $500 to make sure that the children behave. The bellhop places them in front of a television, and when he returns, the girl has a bottle of champagne in her hand, the boy is smoking a cigarette, and the TV is on an adult channel. Rodriguez must have had some bad experiences with children to come up with this one. It is funny and a 7.5/10.The last and not least is by my favorite director, Quentin Tarantino, who plays a movie director(talk about typecasting) who is gathered with others who enjoy a good bet. The wager involves a guy being able to light a Zippo lighter ten times in a row. If he succeeds, he wins a car; if not, his pinky will be chopped off with an extremely sharp hatchet. Ted is drafted to be the executioner with the promise of $1,000. Though a quicky by Tarantino standards, it contains the expected darkness of the diabolical genius. An 8.5/10.

I hadn't heard good things about it, but it looked like it might be good or really bad.The first forty minutes didn't help my initial fears. The first sequence is awful. It's called The Missing Ingrediant. It's about witches who check into a hotel room and are missing an ingredient (male sperm) to complete one of their potions. Ha-ha. Valerina Golino and Madonna are in this one.The second (The Wrong Man) is better, but still too messy, crude and weird. The bellboy Ted (Tim Roth) is taken hostage in one of the hotel rooms for a seedy sexual game between a man and his wife (Jennifer Beals). The joke wears out fast.The third, Misbehavors, directed by Robert Rodriguez, is great fun. It's inspired physical humor in the vein of Chaplin and Keaton. It starts out with Antonio Banderas leaving his kids under the care of Ted the bellhop and they, well, misbehave. It escalates into a frenzy of disaster. Very funny, and Banderas and Roth are great together.The final skit, by Tarantino, The Man from Hollywood, is sick but typical Tarantino - all dialogue, references to other actors and films, etc. Lots of profanity, as well.QT casts himself as a director who entices Ted into his suite. There, he finds Bruce Willis and some others ready to chop a guy's finger off as part of a drunken bet. They pay Ted to do the evil deed, but he doesn't know if he has the guts to do it. (The bet, by the way, inspired by a Hitchcock film with Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre.) Overall this isn't great and I hated the first half. But the last half makes up for the rest and really flies by fast - I loved Rodriguez's sequence, if the rest of the film had been of that caliber, it would have been a great physical comedy. QT's wordy conclusion to the nonsense is kind of apt and the movie ends on a good note.It's also worth noting that Roth's performance in the first half is unbearable, and wonderful in the second half. Very strange, how good directors can transform an actor's performance. Or maybe he was just saving the best for last.

The third segment, The Misbehavers, is funny in another way, it holds a lot of the childish humor we can recognize from Desperado and the Spy Kids-franchise.

Alicia Witt played brief by extraordinary roles in `Dune,' and `Liebstraum.' Sammi Davis was in a Ken Russell film I had seen, `Lair of the White Worm.'
