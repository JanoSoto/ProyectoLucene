[{"Title":"A blaxploitation classic! Possibly Pam Grier's best movie.","Date":"5 March 2003","Score":"32 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Pam Grier made many movies in the 1970s, but 'Coffy' as much as anything, is the one role on which her reputation as the Queen of blaxploitation rests. After a bit part in a Russ Meyer movie (his classic 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls'), Jack Hill, former Roger Corman protege and director of the creepy cult favourite 'Spider Baby', discovered her and gave her two strong roles in his popular chicks-in-chains movies 'The Big Doll House' and 'The Big Bird Cage'. Then Hill wrote and directed 'Coffy', a hugely entertaining revenge thriller that really showcases Pam Grier's talent and charisma to the max. The movie was hugely successful and made Grier an exploitation superstar. Instead of a female James Bond character like Cleopatra Jones, Hill made Coffy a regular working class black woman (a nurse as a matter of fact), who must use her brains and looks to achieve her goal - revenge for the drug addiction of her kid sister. The movie crosses elements seen in the male blaxploitation classics of the period like 'Superfly' and 'Shaft' with the vigilante genre which would really kick off with the success of 'Death Wish' the following year (yup, 'Coffy' PREDATES 'Death Wish', so let's get that straight). Grier is sensational in this movie. She can act, she's tough, she pulls off the action scenes with credibility, and of course she looks great, and there is a fair bit of nudity. Grier went on to movies like 'The Arena', 'Sheba, Baby' and 'Drum' before the blaxploitation boom burst, but it's a pity that she only made one more movie with Jack Hill ('Foxy Brown') because they were a dynamite team bringing out the best in each other. 'Coffy' has some interesting supporting cast members including Allan Arbus (best know to fans of TV's 'M.A.S.H.') as Mob boss Vitroni, future 'Robocop' actor Robert DoQui as flamboyant pimp King George, and the brilliant Sid Haig as the sleazy Omar. Haig was a regular Grier co-star throughout the 1970s and Jack Hill's favourite actor ever since his breakthrough role in 'Spider Baby'. If you really want to understand why so many movie buffs from Quentin Tarantino on down worship Pam Grier then 'Coffy' is THE movie to watch. Arguably her best movie, it's a blaxploitation classic and still great viewing thirty years later! Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in 1970s exploitation or crime movies.

However, it seems that Foxy is far more memorable, with it's over-the-top violence.  This one's pretty violent as well, and has all the Pam Grier scenes that you'd expect.  Coffy offing a drug pusher in the first few minutes, having a touching family moment, fighting a room full of women that results in everyone's top being janked off, some bad guys nuts getting blown off (literally, not figuratively), and, of course, Pam trading blows with at least 2 lesbians at once.  Still, this one has a little more integrity than Foxy, being that it was made first and was a little tamer. Check out Sidney Freidman from M*A*S*H as a sleazy bad guy! This movie passes the time quite nicely. "},{"Title":"Pam, Pam, Pam.  Blam.","Date":"20 January 2001","Score":"21 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Pure action film nirvana, Coffy has got to be one of the slickest pieces of entertainment ever created, not to mention a fantastic Blaxploitation cinema experience. It's a credit to everyone involved in the film that the story could be so gratuitously nonsensical and contrived and still seem completely logical while it's happening. It's like a comic book come to life.Pam Grier plays Coffy, a nurse who goes on a murderous rampage after her sister overdoses on drugs supplied by a pusher who knows that Coffy is sending her money. From the opening scene, where Coffy pulls a severely-sawed-off shotgun out of her macram√© purse to blast a big- time drug dealer to hell, the frantic pace never lets up until the bitter, seething end. After making her first hit, Coffy's vengeance is further stoked when her do-good cop friend is taken out by the dirty dealers for not accepting a payoff. Coffy blows her top and takes some time off work to really go for the jugular, working her way through the city's drug cartel by posing as a Jamaican hooker named Mystique. It's not hard--she gets the vital information in a hilarious scene involving a woman named Priscilla, whose old man, Harriet, turns out to be more than Coffy bargained for.The genius in the film is in the way that Coffy manages to manipulate her way through all of these scenarios. Even the hardest criminals are putty in her hands, and she never looks more beautiful than when she is covered in scratches, grime, and wielding a shotgun. She has a seemingly endless bag of tricks, several of which involve weapons hidden in her astonishing afro. She's comfortable around a gun, but she'll use any old thing lying around to wreak her vengeance a broken wine bottle, a hypodermic needle full of dope, a makeshift shiv, even a convenient rock lying on the side of the road.By the time the climax rolls around, the film has become deliriously exciting, building continuously upwards until you think it might collapse in on itself. But it doesn't. Coffy stands tall, even over the strains of a closing song that tells us Revenge is a virtue. This film is perfect in every way.

Jack Hill (The Big Doll House, The Big Bird Cage) was at the helm again, along with the tried-and-tested formula of Pam Grier and Sid Haig.  Coffy is a nurse by day and avenging angel at night, tracking down the dealers who got her sister hooked on the Big H. She opens the film blowing the head off a dealer with a shotgun, then follows the trail of dead bodies to a bald hood named Omar and her crooked politician boyfriend, who she shoots in the balls.  Revenge is a virtue, the soundtrack blares; critics applauded the liberated ballsy lead character while decrying the level of sex and sadism.  As revenge actioners go, Coffy don't come better.  Grier in her first lead role is a sensation.  Little wonder Tarantino tailor-made a film for her.

Coffy has it all, violence, pimps, drugs, nudity, sex, and it's served up with some severe camp and crazy dialogue.  what sets this movie apart from other blaxploitaion movies is the excellent story and powerful performance of Miss Grier.  I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off, and despite the low budget ambiance and feeling the movie took about a couple of weeks to make, Grier gives a performance worthy of her cult reverence.the movie is a typical revenge story, with a not so typical hero-a black woman.  Coffy's sister is hooked on smack and Coffy vows to herself to destroy the people responsible.  Coffy works as a nurse by day, and prowls the clubs by night looking for the pusher who destroyed her sister's mind with drugs.  Her search leads her to a pimp, a mobster, the cops, and a politician.  In the end, she takes care of them all using her brains as well as her body, and damn do she have a body!  Pam Grier makes this movie believable despite the obvious flaws of the low budget production.  Her character never shows the weak side of femininity and fall into the ethos that women are at some point weaker than men.  Coffy never breaks down to cry for help, waiting for a man or anyone else to help her-she does it all on her own.  she kicks ass all over, and no other movie has done that with a female character, at least not anything credible.  Coffy makes Thelma and Louise look like Laverne and Shirley.Pam went on to make more movies of this ilk, but none were as popular nor as good as Coffy.   what about Foxy Brown you ask?  despite a better title, it doesn't compare to Coffy in either performance or content.  Coffy served to bring Pam Grier into the main stream, as much as any black actress could be, and make her a star.  all i can say is, thank you Quentin Tarentino for making Jackie Brown and proving her power and presence as an actress.  See this movie, then see Jackie Brown,  you'll see why Tarentino made it.

It is apparent after watching this film that no one remembers this for the bad-acting and dialogue, but for Pam Grier herself as a mean mutha who can kick some a$$ when she has to!This movie SCREAMS 'early 70's', from the afro wigs to the awesome outfits Coffy finds herself wearing whether it be at a gala for call girls or when she's undercover to kick some drug-dealer's nasty behind!This brilliant film mixes comedy right in there with the action. From the campy catfight scenes when Coffy dumps a salad bowl onto a blonde girl's head, to when King George makes his first appearance and steps out of his car in his pimp outfit, complete right down to the feather in his hat!!! Just seeing Coffy smash a wine bottle on a table to defend herself against a crackhead wielding a knife is rioutous enough! Watch out for the scene where she puts razor blades in her hair!!!There is also a lot of unintentional comedy in there as well. Look for the scene where Carter frisks a male suspect who makes the mistake of putting his hands through Coffy's car window!The action is fairly consistent. There are a lot of guns firing off, endless catfights that result in each girl having their dresses ripped open to expose their breasts(!!!) and an awesome scene that results in King George getting tied up with a noose and dragged through an obstacle course behind a car.But every time Coffy appears on screen and you just KNOW that some bad stuff is about to go down, you know that you're going to be taken for a fun ride! As I mentioned above, no one is watching this movie for an Oscar-nominated performance or even a decent soundtrack (the Coffy theme sung by the Gladys Knight & The Pips-wannabes halfway through the movie is timeless!!!) - you're there to be entertained... and entertained is what you'll get, guaranteed.

Aside from Tarantino's Jackie Brown (of which not only did that filmmaker take license with the 'take no prisoners' style of Grier, but the best musical pieces as well), this is Pam Grier's finest turn in what some consider in the exploitation-movie world as the first 'black-exploitation' classic. But to say that everything in the film is exploitive of black culture might be a little far to say. While to be sure the film depicts some of the black characters with their flamboyant clothing (including things that are pretty funny today like King George's cape and one-piece suit with emblem), and it also keeps to the quasi-tenement of this wave of movies where practically all of the white characters are real drug kingpins or bad gangsters, there's the fact that Grier's character- through crime and revenge and all- is just trying, in her mind, to do the best thing possible. There's also her friend Carter, who is one of the (only) honest cops in this underground of drugs and gangsters. But then again, to take such a story to heart would be missing the point writer/director Hill is after.Because for its main center of a message, that pushing drugs on people who don't know any better (or do) is wrong to the point of having to take personal action (or standing up for the rights), this is not at all a preachy movie. If anything this is the kind of sexy, cool, violent, hilarious and just plain fun kind of movie-making that could've only come from this small corner of B-movie-making. Right from the start where the guy's head gets blown off, it only gets better with a logic that works like such- the more over-the-top, the better, the more stylish its more appealing, and for every ham-bone acting performance (albeit with a great deal of talent) there's an exciting action scene or fight. But also with this AIP mentality of having lots of hot bodied women (both white and black) in tow with dozens of breasts and other female parts, and the message covered around in stuff that's meant to be really for surface appeal, it takes itself seriously for what it's worth. Jack Hill is actually, for all intents and purposes, a very fine and under-looked genre-film writer and sometimes gives the dialog an uplift from the trash it could've been. His direction, while sometimes not given enough of what's needed (lights for one thing, just enough to get by it seems), gets the job done. And at the end of the day what most people will remember of the film- aside from the nude girls fight and Sid Haig sporting a red bandanna and a Hispanic accent- is Grier herself. She carries this character with enough appeal to make it known why her cult status is solidified; she's sincere when she's (occassionally) really being herself with what matters to her, but also very sensual, perfectly sneaky, and has that kind of other-worldly heroic spirit that almost makes her like some kind of comic-book hero or something. If for no other reason, Grier makes Coffy still something to check out 30-something years later, and more than just a curio for Jackie Brown fans looking for the roots of that film's success.

Thanks to Turner Classic Movies 'Rob Zombie Friday Night' features my husband and I were able to see both Coffy and Foxy Brown. Prior to actually seeing these films one had steered clear of the genre due to all of the terrible contemporary reviews. Now over 30 years later it was a sheer delight to see the beauteous and talented Pamela Grier in a gritty and electrifying portrayal. Coffy is simply a non-stop action thriller with humor juxtaposed to scenes of violence. There is not really any time to catch one's breath Hill's direction is frenetic and impressive. The marvelous Robert DoQui does his usual excellent work as King George, many may remember him in Altman's Nashville (1975)as Wade Cooley. The cast is wonderful, the acting is over the top and yet it all works together. The injustices of that era are now, sadly, all too easily recognizable and Hill's script is too spot on to be considered campy. The magic of Coffy is, however, Pamela Grier. This woman is simply a joy to behold. There is abundant nudity in Coffy and it is very apropos. Foxy Brown is a decidedly 2nd rate film by comparison. But it today!

Her acting wasn't all that bad--it's much better than most of the other women in the picture and a lot of the men, to be honest--and she had the revenge-minded, ass-kickin' mama persona down pat. What really makes her stand out, however, is her sexuality--she is absolutely explosive. Her frequent nudity is one of the film's saving graces, but it's not really gratuitous (not that there's anything wrong with that, either)--as another poster pointed out, her nude scenes seemed to be done on her own terms and not because the producer or director said, OK, baby, show us what you got. The scene where she's lounging by the pool in a bikini and first meets superpimp King George is astounding--how actor Robert DoQui restrained himself from leaping on her as soon as he saw her is a feat of self-discipline that's almost superhuman. The party scene later on, where Pam comes in dressed up as a streetwalker (and raises the temperature of the room 20 degrees) then shortly afterward gets in a knock-down, drag-out fight with several of King George's jealous girls, is another of the film's highlights.The picture does have its downsides, mainly in the performances (yeah, like you watch these kinds of films for the acting . . . ). Robert DoQui, although a very good actor generally, just isn't convincing as King George (his superpimp outfit is hilarious, though). William Elliot, as apparently the only honest cop in the L.A.P.D. and Coffy's friend who wants to be more than that, is bland and doesn't make any kind of an impression. Booker Bradshaw as Coffy's politician lover who, although she doesn't know it, is partners with the city's biggest pimp/drug dealer gives probably the worst performance in the movie. He plays his part with little conviction and you get the impression that he thinks this kind of picture is beneath him. He loosens up a bit towards the end, but by then it's too little too late.On the other hand, the action scenes are well done, and of course there's the great Sid Haig as a mob killer who gets a little poetic justice in the end. This is Pam Grier's picture, though, and she more than makes up for whatever shortcomings it has. Several of her subsequent films in this genre are much better than this one, but this will serve as a good introduction to the Pam Grier experience. It's the picture that made her a star, and it's easy to see why. It may be a bit choppy and somewhat primitive but it's a lot of fun, and Pam Grier is stupendous. Check it out. "},{"Title":"Coffy?

Hill wanted to work with Pam Grier with whom he had worked on The Big Doll House (1971). The film ended up earning more money than Cleopatra Jones and established Grier as an icon of the genre.Now, we might ask how Hill -- a white man -- ended up doing blaxploitation cinema. I have met Hill, and nothing about him suggests he would be the man for the job. And yet, he did that genre a great service by championing Grier and bringing his regular Sid Haig (playing Omar here) along for the ride. Karen Ross has written that the film allowed African Americans the ultimate escape to cheer on the heroine that fought corruption and crime as well as the white power structure. How ironic it was brought to them by a white man.

She becomes an one-woman war on organized crime on Los Angeles.Written and Directed by Jack Hill (The Big Doll House, The Big Bird Cage, Foxy Brown) made an entertaining, action-thriller with sense of humour. Grier is fun to watch as the title character, she has some great dialogue and of course, she has an great body (Which she does appear topless at times). It is amusing to see Robert DoQui, who is best known for the RoboCop Trilogy as a pimp! and Sid Haig (House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects) as a low-life criminal.DVD has an fine non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an decent Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. DVD has an fairly interesting commentary by the writer/director of the film and original theatrical trailer is also included. Coffy was an big hit back in 1973. Grier is certainly one of the sexy black woman's out there, certainly back in the 1970's, she was absolutely stunning. Coffy does have some flaws but it is an trashy enjoyable action flick to watch.

Jack Hill's movies always had believable characters and compelling drama, and Coffy is certainly no exception. Surprisingly for a blaxploitation flick, its remarkably free of the stereotypes and over-the-top excess that was inherent in later entries such as Dolemite. Those expecting a campy laugh fest will be disappointed. Also, the characters of Coffy and William Elliott are likable and surprisingly well developed. Jack Hill's direction is quite accomplished, and he makes the best of the occasionally obvious low budget. Grier's performance is revelatory, and while her acting skill wasn't as accomplished here as it later would be, she shows plenty of raw charisma and screen presence.However, drive-in fans shouldn't fret, because this is still an exploitation film. Its chock full of the seedy and tasteless elements we know and love. While Pam Grier is more restrained, many of the villains are amusingly overplayed, especially the scene-stealing Sid Haig (previously in Jack Hill's cult classic Spider Baby). There's plenty of sex and violence to keep us on the edge of our seats, not to mention one of cinema's most memorable cat-fight sequences. The film is very quickly paced and never dull. Its free of the filler sequences that often plagued this kind of film. Coffy is an exploitation classic for a reason. Its one of the drive-in cinema's most entertaining offerings.

Those reviews will soon come, but first, COFFY.Pam Grier's sister is comatose because of drugs, so Grier grabs a gun, poses as a hooker, and kicks some serious ass! While Grier hadn't really proven herself as an actress in this stage of her career, she still holds a powerful presence and is possibly the most beautiful black woman I've seen in cinema (Laura Gemser doesn't count, she's not black). Some great scenes include Grier blowing the head off a pusher, getting into a huge catfight with a group of hookers complete with razorblades in her Afro and crashing furniture over heads, and Grier enacting revenge on her gangster boyfriend by shooting him in the crotch. To my surprise, music from this film shows up in JACKIE BROWN!

I can't get enough of especially the films of which they collaborated, 'Foxy Brown' and this, both of which I consider up there with the 'Shaft' trilogy and 'Super Fly' as masterpieces of the 'urban action' genre of the 70's. She, just 24 when she made this, certainly was one of the most beautiful and exciting women ever put on celluloid, and while I also love both Hill's short film 'The Host' and 'Switchblade Sisters' (viewed on one DVD as part of Quentin Tarantino's 'Rolling Thunder' reissue series), here his pacing and filming are on an entirely different level altogether.It's a shame for us cinephiles that he chose at such an early age, 42 and clearly in his filmmaking prime, to retire from the business to both write novels as well as explore meditation with his wife, but I'm thankful for the films he made. The soundtrack (and most particularly the killer title song) by one of my favourite jazz/funk singer/musicians of the period, Roy Ayers, is up there with Curtis Mayfield's for 'Super Fly' as essential listening for lovers of such music.Say what you want about him as a filmmaker, but I for one am glad that Tarantino has revived interest in both the actress (casting her as the star of 'Jackie Brown') and the director (through his aforementioned reissue series). It is an under-recognized way that Tarantino has significantly contributed to contemporary American cinema of all sorts, and has helped these unsung heroes from prior generations, who would otherwise be neglected and ignored unjustly from contemporary cinephilic attention.

Jack Hill's 1973 original is so spirited, passionate, and deliberately daft that it's impossible not to be persuaded by its cool and its convictions. Grier is the titular wild cat from the tropical jungle, spitting her lines with thrilling viciousness, and wielding a gaze that promises pain. Yet Coffy isn't cold and immune, she's emotionally sensitive. Sentimental, even. She's also smart, confident, principled, and outrageously sexy. Choice theme lyric Coffee is the colour of your skin. Yes, the movie is fantastically dated; a true product of its era. It's lurid and ridiculous, yet boldly progressive. Other mainstream movies of the time might give us black pimps and junkies, but here we have black cops and surgeons, and it's the lascivious whites who run amok.Coffy is a nurse. She wants revenge on the perps responsible for her little sister's drug addiction. She starts with the pushers but gradually she finds the rot goes all the way to the top to the politicians who want to keep the common man (and woman) down, and who are just in it for the green. It's a conveyor belt of sin controlled by men. So Coffy preys on male vulnerability &#x96; specifically the sexuality of men, via her own seductive powers. In observing this sordid sacrifice, does the film indulge the very misogyny it purports to condemn? Here lies the essence of the exploitation genre in exploiting, it explores, and in exploring, it exploits. Coffy isn't a complex or subtle film. For a start, it's laughably moralistic about drug abuse. Saying that, there is some simplistic wisdom in its depiction of the drugs hierarchy the real problem is at the top, not on the streets. In Coffy's world, it's all about the System, and ultimately it's a System presided over by evil white men. One couldn't argue that a girl-fight in which every combatant has her top ripped off is clever satire; but at other times the satire does stick, such as when councilman Brunswick (Booker Bradshaw) slams the white patriarchy... and is immediately told off-camera by his honky PR man that he came off as real convincing. This is a great sub-plot, wisely promoted to the main game by the final reel, leading to a tense final showdown which cautions as to the dangers of playing a System that itself corrupts its players. The ending is also a fitting moment of gender reassertion, before we're given a classic final shot. With fabulously far-fetched plotting married to a knowing sense of humour (Coffy's Jamaican act is a keeper), punctuated by tub-thumping speeches and spasms of deeply significant violence (thugs beating a black cop; a lynching; a shotgun castration), Coffy is a hugely enjoyable and meaning-packed movie, and a milestone in black cinema.

Let's face it blaxploitation flicks are trash, nudie cuties stirred up with drug violence and gang warfare without enough acumen to make for anything besides low, low, art. For the most part, they consist of a few ticklish one-liners, a myriad of boob flashes, and a h*ll of a lot of gun shots, cocaine snorts, and shag carpets. Today, we're fond of their terribleness. They remind us of a time when films could be sleazy and unapologetic, bulletproof to critics because they catered to audiences looking for skin, slaughter, and post-Motown blackness.But Pam Grier doesn't, and never did, disappear into the background noise of better films. As of this moment, you probably can't remember what Tamara Dobson (Cleopatra Jones) looked like, how Ron O'Neal (Superfly) sounded when he was high on movie coke &#x97; but I guarantee that, in ten years, Grier will still be hanging around in your psyche, personifying the ever elusive film femme that was strong and scrappy but also feminine and sensitive. As Roger Ebert reminded us in his original review of 1973's Coffy, Grier essentially reversed the stereotypes strung together by the majority of blaxploitation thrillers. Most gave the man the duty to save the day while the love interest waited around in bed until he finally fixed things up and had time to make some water bedded love. But Grier, or perhaps, writer/director Jack Hill, in an honorably feminist mood, asked a question most left untouched what would happen if the woman saved the day, and didn't need a man to survive in a cold, hard world of drugs, cash, and hookers?As Coffy opens, its titular matron is p-ssed. Kills two drug pushers with a shotgun p-ssed. Is willing to slaughter more criminals p-ssed. Smacking the blood on her lips p-ssed. Why? Her sweet little sister, apparently not as precious as she thought, has destroyed her sacred life with laced heroin, laying sick and immobile in a hospital that would rather get rid of her than help her out. Coffy wanted her young sibling to have dreams, to dance, to let her hair down in a wholesome, Doris Day kind of way. So when those hopes are diminished, she decides to get revenge on the drug mavens who gave her the goods in the first place. After violent confrontations continue on in a vicious cycle, she finally sets her sights on crime lord King George (Robert Duqui), who seems to be behind all the street crud that has sabotaged her life. And when it turns out that her congressman boyfriend (Booker Bradshaw) also has a part in the corruption, she figures she may as well throw caution to the wind and go all out. Grier can do it all she's a terrific actress, as much of a presence as the mainstream broads that, more than once, stole her thunder, and she's a worthy exhibitionist, proud of her extremely (extremely) curvaceous body and more than happy to flaunt it. But she isn't much like a Russ Meyer girl with busty proportions and not much else &#x97; she is so commanding in her sexual prowess that, like Nicki Minaj (I'm going out on a limb here), we find ourselves as much titillated by her presence as we are unsure how to react to it. For Grier (and Coffy), sex is a weapon, and she knows how to use it.But Grier isn't so dependent on her chest that she forgets to act; she really and truly knows what the h*ll she is doing and makes Coffy's lame dialogue suddenly seem like urban Shakespeare. Other actors in the room don't even try to give Hill's lazy writing any sort of life; Grier, though, pretends she's reciting something the Academy would give notice to. She makes Coffy a superbly memorable character, not just for her physical presence but also for her craftiness, her sincere, empathetic hatred for the men that destroyed her sister's life.I won't go into details regarding the productional values of Coffy; everything other than Grier, and the funk obsessed soundtrack, instantly leaves the memory with its routine sex, drugs, and revenge plot. It's an average film with a too-good-for-her-material actress as its front-and-center. A shame &#x97; most never knew what to do with Grier after the blaxploitation era ended should she be a villain? A detective? A wise older woman? Thank God Quentin Tarantino swooped down to save her from further career monstrosities through 1997's Jackie Brown then and there was she able to prove that she was so much more than an icon of an otherwise trashy 1970s subgenre. She was also a leading lady with class, with major talent. Coffy is a showcase for her unique abilities that puts its brazenness aside in favor of a goddess of an actress.

It was a box-office hit and Pam Grier became the first female African-American protagonist of an action movie.Flower Child Coffin (Pam Grier), also known as Coffy, is a nurse whose little sister's life has been ruined by heroin. In the first scenes, Coffy finds the dealers who got her sister hooked on heroin and, pretending to be willing to do anything for a fix, goes home with them and kills them. Later in the movie, when two masked men beat up and seriously injure her police friend Carter in his home, while she's present, because he wouldn't be bribed, she decides to avenge him.Even though the main character fights what we could call a war against drugs, the movie's message isn't you shouldn't do drugs. As I said before, this is a blaxploitation movie &#x96; a movie that exploits certain themes. The story itself isn't very relevant. It's all about watching Coffy, often naked, getting her revenge by killing people and fighting other, often naked, women. And it is Coffy &#x96; or better, Pam Grier &#x96; who leads the movie. She is great in her performance, and truly believable whenever men fall for her, it's obviously because of her beauty and charms &#x96; she is sexy and she knows it, and she uses these qualities to get what she wants. Also, her relationship with her sister isn't developed at all, but we still take her (Coffy's) side in her fighting the drug bosses, again because of her amazing performance.Of course, this isn't an excellent movie, but you shouldn't expect much from the exploitation genre. It's just meant to entertain it makes people laugh &#x96; like in this movie, when Coffy gets in a fight with some hookers and throws a bowl of salad onto one girl's head -, shocks &#x96; the best example being the killing of a man by tying a noose around his neck, attaching the rope to a car and dragging him around town -, and features a lot of female nudity; but it has many flaws &#x96; to give just one example, some of the supporting actors' performances are bad, but in a funny way, and the movie is sometimes boring.

In the opening, she poses as a woman hooked on drugs, looking for her next fix, portraying herself as one of the many women that will do anything for drugs. This leads to a quite graphic scene in which Coffy blows the head off a dealer with a shotgun.Within an exploitation industry that played very much within the confines of misogyny, this particular blaxploitation film offers a more feminist approach to the subject. At the time black films were largely masculine in their output, with lead actors such as Rudy Ray Moore, who would treat female characters with seeming disdain, and they were fundamentally in the films as sexual objects. In Coffy, Grier obliterates the ideal of the passive woman, and gleefully attacks both men and women in her mission to destroy the illegal drugs industry. This inevitably leads her to areas of society formally thought to be justified; including a local politician who Coffy has been in a relationship with.Coffy is an interesting twist on the male dominated blaxploitation genre, and Grier is sensational in the lead - it is easy to see why she has endured where many other actresses of the decade have disappeared into obscurity. It does still have sequences of gratuitous female nudity (but that is simple symptomatic of the period), such as the party scene where Coffy attacks the harem of prostitutes under the control of the over-the-top, garishly dressed pimp, King George (Robert DoQui), whose collection of onesy outfits are spectacularly '70's. I find most of the charm of these low budget '70's films to be held in their outrageous iconography - the fashions and outlandish decorations are a special joy to behold. Unusually for the time, Coffy does not glorify drugs and the activities of the criminals, but does show the ubiquitous theme that authorities were implicit in pushing drugs into the black ghettos of America.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Fun and volcanic exploitation","Date":"16 November 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Coffy is a nurse whose younger sister gets involved in drugs and is severely injured by contaminated heroin. She sets out on a mission of vengeance and vigilante justice killing drug dealers, pimps, and mobsters who cross her path. Oh yeah, right away you know what you are in for when you hear about the movie Coffy. It's a foxy and fun film oozing with cheesiness and greatness, topped with Pam Grier's fabulous performance. I loved her character so damn much. With Coffy, there is not much I disliked. This movie captured the true essence of an exploitation film, so to speak. There's great volcanic violence, sassy remarks, smooth music, and non-stop fun. The plot was decent and very problem free, and the intense action scenes put you on the edge of your seat. My favorite scenes were the climax and ending, and the fight scene between all the girls was unforgettable; I loved it! Good movie altogether, one I would recommend to people who know how to use it well. It has a great main character and I'm sure I'll show no hesitance in watching Coffy again whenever I want to.

Soon she will be against all the scum (including pimps, drug lords, corrupt cops and politics) trying to finish with their business.Coffy is, without a doubt, one of the most important and influential blaxploitation films made in the 70's. For me is a great, fun and pure entertainment. The plot is simple but very good, but definitely the best part of the film is the character of Coffy played in a great and very sexy way by Pam Grier. I really love this character, first because she represents that a woman can be really strong, just as Uma Thurman's character in Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 made twenty and twenty-one years later. And second because she has two very different personalities, first as a lovely nurse who seems to have an excellent friendship with an honest cop but when she most deal with those very dangerous men she is a very strong avenger in consequence of the love to her sister and the rage she feels because of the injustice in the world. There is a dialog in which Coffy says something like I feel like i'm on a dream where kill you is not difficult to me, she says that to a corrupt politic who once were her love. So i really like that because in her dream she is a completely different person fighting against the scum of the world. Another Travis Bickle.The rest of the characters are not great but are the perfect complement to the memorable character of Pam Grier. But is all fun, with Arturo Vitroni (Allan Arbus) a gangster who reminds me Borat because of his funny voice and King George (Robert DoQui) the classic pimp. Also is really cool to watch a very young Sid Haig now more recognized thanks to Captain Spaulding, his character in Rob Zombie's first two films.And the music is a terrific aspect of the film, specially the song that appears before the opening credits; all composed by Roy Ayers considered the father of modern acid jazz. I haven't listen all the soundtrack but the songs in the film are really good.Conclusion i really enjoy this blaxploitation film full of crazy and funny scenes. I highly recommend this film to everybody who knows something about exploitation films and to those who are fans of Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown. Be prepared to this entertaining and funny ride with the biggest star of the genre, Pam Grier.Yes she is a foxy lady. 10 out of 10DVD I recently order this DVD because is impossible to find it in Mexico and i really wanted to watch the film. Is a single edition with just a comment by the director Jack Hill and the theatrical trailer. I really like it!

All of these malfeasants exist in this universe for the sole purpose of getting offed by our busy vigilantress, and we're only introduced to them long enough to find out how despicable they are, thus inducing even louder cheers when Coffy gives them their due.The plot in this outing concerns... oh, who really cares? All you need to know is that Grier spends half the movie undressed and the other half offing a rogues gallery of one-dimensional criminals in various nasty ways. If you're not sold right there, I don't know why you're wasting time reading this review.It seems silly to dissect this film under normal criteria, but it's worth pointing out that in Coffy's world, the good guys do as many evil deeds at the bad guys, and those who don't are destined to be deceased before the final credits roll. I'm not sure if this means anything, or if Coffy's creators even thought about it, but intentional or not, the it's bad to be square mentality seems to be hinted at here in the same way that the sex kills mantra subtly permeates many slasher films. However, to be fair, it's highly unlikely that there was any sort of sociological message in the minds of the film-makers, because judging by the fast pace and near-lack of character establishment beyond set-ups of carnage and carnality (even Coffy's romantic scenes with her man only serve to add to the viewer's thirst for revenge when he's later revealed to be a villain), the only underlining theme of Coffy seems to be that nudity, violence, and action forge an entertaining trifecta. Which, all things considered, isn't a bad premise to build a movie around.It's hard to know 30+ years later how much of the humor in the film is intentional, but there's plenty to be had. Beyond the one-liners, the simple absurdity of the situations (consider the brilliant Sid Haig's postponement of Coffy's murder when she suggests they should have a bit of nookie first) and the seemingly unintentional hilarity of some of the ribald dialogue add in elements that nearly push the film into the realm of comedy. Even the music, while as funky and delicious as you'd hope for, generates as much laughter as soul (actual lyrics King George... He's a pimp). And try to contain yourself during the film's absurdist high-point, when a shoddily-constructed dummy is dragged behind a car, I dare you.This is all irrelevant, surely. Whatever the film-makers were setting out to create, this is what they produced, and it's perfect in its own awesome way. Any slights levied against the film for the cheesy effects, the bad acting, or the silly dialogue can only be offered by critics who are woefully missing the point. If you want high art, this is clearly the wrong choice for you. But for those who love the simple and effective entertainment of classic trash cinema, Coffy is a superlative gem.

The Birmingham Sunday event brought a nightmare that came in the form of a black girl with a lethal, 1957 Plymouth Fury powered by Mad God Chaos. By September to November, 1963; 60 white people & 8 African-Americans was killed by this unstoppable force & met her end at Garfield's Garage. The re-enactment of the Birmingham Angel's last stand was used in King's movie, Christine. In 1973, Jack Hill decided to have his version of Christine McKay. In the form of Coffy. And instead of going after Church Bombers, his McKay, takes after the drug trade that overdosed her 11 year old sister. Jack Hill used her sister for a stand-in for Denise McNair, one of the Sunday school girls killed on Birmingham Sunday. Coffy did better than Vincent Price did in Dr. Phibes & Theatre of Blood. In the two movies one victim survives. However the worst of the worst was played by now-gone actor named Booker Bradshaw & he gets it in the end. However Booker Bradshaw appeared in many stories & worked for Ruby-Spears outfit as voices for cartoon characters. As for Coffy & Christine McKay, they both wear white outfits & Coffy is a nurse & at her place of work she wears white. Christine McKay used a '57 Fury to run down people. Coffy used a hijacked, 1962 Chrysler to crash into the mobster's house & gets him. The actor who played the mobster was also Dr. Sidney Freud & was featured in episodes of M*A*S*H. The King George Character ended up dragged by his car & in Jasper, TX an re-enactment of the scene in 1998 is now termed as Hate Crime. But Booker Bradshaw did a good job playing the top villains who gets it in the end. Pam Grier gets them all. And I wonder where Pam Grier was when the events of September 15, 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama went down? By the way Coffy's real surname is Coffin. And at least Coffy didn't end up like Christine McKay did at Garfield's Garage, November 8th, 1963. Coffy was a good film & as the for the guys who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church & were still free in 1973, perhaps had nightmares of Coffy coming to get them after she got the drug dealers. But we'll never find out about that. So this is Marcus Brainard, good day! "},{"Title":"She's a wild animal! I've got to have that girl, George!

She's a nurse who seeks revenge, on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine. Like any 70s Blaxploitation flick, you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts. There were scores of these films made during the 70s, and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films, and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its type, include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and sex-crazed gorgeous women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers, pimps, mobsters, and other criminal scum.Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was magnificent, being both tough-as-nails, and drop-dead gorgeous. Like in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen, that these sorts of films are unwatchable, without her as the main character. If you like Pam Grier, you're better off seeing her other films, like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleaze, than Coffy does. Pam's character in Coffy, degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films, don't stoop as low to get revenge, as Coffy did. I'd say, only watch Coffy, if you're unable to see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress, makes viewing Coffy bearable.

Using her looks and body to get herself into the right places, Coffy takes out pusher King George before working her way up the supply chain to get bloody revenge.Although I do tend to perhaps be a little unforgiving towards some films, there are some occasions where you do need to accept the flaws of the genre you are walking into and that to criticise it for them is a little unfair because you really should have come to the film on its terms. This is not to say that you cannot have a bad genre movie but just that a film might not be any good but can still be good within the realms of its own genre. This, in case you hadn't guessed, brings me to Coffy &#150; a violent, sexual, sexist and silly thriller. I'll lay it all out first by echoing the comments of my girlfriend and fellow viewer when she said this is the most ridiculous film I've ever seen.She said this shortly after a cat fight where endless breasts tumble of dresses and after yet another violent exchange and what she said did have an element of truth to it. Because by normal standards Coffy is nonsense that aims for its target audience with few aspirations above the gutter. It is trashy from the start to the end with the nudity and violence being gratuitous and excessive throughout. Not only this but it does get to the point of being silly &#150; the cat fight in particular is absurdity and trashiness combined. However, I can (and will) also say these as things that make the film worth watching but most of these are essentially what the blaxploitation genre did at its cheesiest. Looking at it that way, the film is actually pretty good within the genre because the plot and deliver holds it mostly together and, surprisingly, it never felt cheap or tacky even when it was being trashy. The violence is extreme but the plot just about holds it in place and gives it a reason for happening. It doesn't really justify all the nudity but when it is Pam Grier I think it tends to justify itself.She is not a great actress and she shows it here; whenever she is given a scene where the centre is Coffy's centre, she doesn't really convince. However as a presence she is impressive and on the basis of this alone you can understand why she got famous from these films. The support cast are very much secondary but they are mostly OK, from Bradshaw through DoQui, Elliott and so on. Hill's direction is stylish and he captures the funk of the period well, weaving it through his film in the way you expect from the genre. His script is not brilliant but again the tough and street smart dialogue do make an impression (and credit too for at least trying to create characters and a story).Is Coffy brilliant? Well, no, of course not; it is silly and excessive with violence and nudity throughout. The fairer question to ask is, is Coffy a good genre film?

On one hand, the film is very poorly made--with some terribly over the top performances and lots of gratuitous nudity and violence. On the other, it's so gosh-darn entertaining that you can't stop watching!! Pam Grier is the title character. She is on a private mission to kill those she feels are responsible for hooking her much younger sister on heroin. The first ten minutes of the film are probably the best--with an amazingly silly but highly entertaining pair of killings. Seeing the shotgun scene is something you WON'T soon forget! Also, seeing the cat fight scene is a real hoot--particularly Coffy's creative use of razor blades! However, just killing low level pushers isn't all that satisfying to Coffy, as she's determined to work her way up to Mr. Big. So much of the film consists of her doing undercover work so she can find and kill this man. Now here's the funny part--to infiltrate the mob, Pam Grier pretends to be Jamaican yet her accent is atrocious when she actually remembers to use it! Much of the time, she totally forgets and the director doesn't even seem to notice this omission--nor do the bad guys! The leader of the mob is a real piece of work. This White guy falls for Coffy but also takes great pleasure in demeaning her and treating her like garbage because she's Black--a great metaphor for the Black American experience that must have made quite an emotional impact on audiences of the time. However, before she can kill this creep, she is captured and it looks like Coffy is going to die. See the rest of the film to see the twists and turns and violent (yet satisfying) ending. After all, once she is captured, the film shifts into high gear and it doesn't let up until the frenzy of blood-letting is complete.On a totally non-intellectual level, this movie is practically non-stop action and seeing the slimy devils die is very satisfying on a very basic level--seeing bad guys die and lots of naked women will appeal to the Bevis and Buttheads in the audience! However, at the same time, there are bad acting, silly plot devices and a general trashiness of the film (with the rough language, copious amounts of very gratuitous nudity and silly dialog). This is a film you can enjoy but it still is essentially a stupid movie with practically no redeeming value.By the way, Pam Grier made three very, very similar movies in successive years--COFFY(1973), FOXY BROWN (1974) and SHEBA BABY (1975).

Luckily, if you're one of the few who read my statements on femme fatale flicks, now is the time to recover halfway. Pam Grier outdoes any actress, past or present, who performs action roles and does kick-butting on the screen. Her mean mother attitude bodes very well for the blaxplo genre. The bad news, unfortunately, is that it's an exploitation movie filled with bodacious ladies, and (still) scarce action from Grier. Here's where the hype doesn't really show itself. Most of the time, our big bad mama gets messed around and tortured, and exposes all her bare necessities. Same thing for FOXY BROWN. With the groove additive in many of these films, it won't be a huge problem for many of us, including myself, to sit back and enjoy. It would be surprising to see Sid Haig steal the movie just for dragging the poor guy out on the road, however Grier's last-minute revenge saves the film entirely. Still, this is good cream-filled entertainment down to the bottom of the cup. Don't expect Pam Grier to be THE ultimate action heroine like some have believed, but the best potential illustrates her prescence in moviedom.   "},{"Title":"What the hell does `blaxploitation' mean?","Date":"11 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I imagine it has something to do with the weak script and plot that Coffy has, but this movie doesn't exactly exploit African Americans any more than a sex thriller like Poison Ivy or something exploits white people. Coffy isn't really that bad of a movie if you can look past the same old revenge plot and the fact that, while she's not bustin' some hoodlum ass, Coffy is some sort of nurse in her spare time. This woman is like the black female version of Rambo, but the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough for this to be a problem.Coffy is a tough black woman who decides to take matters into her own hands when the law proves powerless to help catch the drug dealers who turned her little sister into a drugged out vegetable. To make matter's worse, a friend of Coffy's named Carter, a police officer, gets beaten (in a pathetic fight scene) and suffers brain damage, further enraging Coffy. The whole movie is about drugs and violence, and Coffy pretends to be Mr. George's newest ho so that she can get close to her enemies and bring them down from the inside. Mr. George, by the way, is a hilariously stereotypical 70s pimp, with his felt hat, ridiculous glasses, and matching pastel outfit that is so tight that he sports a cameltoe.While at a party with Mr. George, Coffy contaminates his drug supply, replacing his cocaine stash with sugar. This is the party where that classic cat-fight scene takes place, with Coffy getting into a side-splitting scuffle with all the rest of Mr. George's harem, and having committed the laughable idea of booby-trapping her hair with razor blades. Okay, now we're really getting to know how much this movie takes itself seriously. And I won't even mention the monstrous lesbian girlfriend of Priscilla, the character that was introduced just before the most idiotic fight scene in the entire film. And then there was the car chase near the end of the film in which the cop drives like a Duke of Hazzard for no apparent reason.While the movie is filled with crap like this and is therefore a definitive B-movie, there were some relatively interesting things going on. For example, it was actually pretty clever the way that Coffy was able to turn the drug dealers against each other so that she didn't have to do all of the killing herself. Also, while all of the fight scenes were awful, some of the violence was surprisingly, and often disturbingly, convincing. When George is dragged to death behind the car, for example, it was obviously a dummy being dragged but the fact that hate-crimes like this have been so notoriously committed against blacks, the emotional impact made it much more effective. Maybe that's what blaxploitation is referring to.The standard revenge plot is not given much of a twist in Coffy, and the closing scene with her walking alone on a beach at sunset doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. There is some pretty funny dialogue, though. White Zombie fans are sure to recognize her quote early in the film just before she un-heads some drug dealer with a shotgun (`This is the end of your rotten life you mother-F*CKIN'-dope pusher!'). BLAM!! Yeah Coffy! And then at the end, some guy begs for his life while in a swimming pool while Coffy points a shotgun at him, and she says, `Sheeeit, I ain't gonna kill you.' BLAM!! Yeah Coffy!It's no secret that this is not Oscar material. It's a cheesy action film with bad acting and a recycled story, but if you keep that in mind when you watch it, it's actually enjoyable, at least on a few meager levels. Maxim magazine lists Coffy as number 7 on its list of the 50 best B-movies of all time, and there can clearly be no mistake about its status as a B-movie. Enjoy, but be aware of the movie's limitations.  "}]
