Yet there are few combat scenes, and no mock heroics.  What makes this movie successful is its depiction of war from the viewpoint of the men in the platoon.  The film takes place primarily during the course of a walk from the beach at Salerno, Italy where the platoon has landed to a farmhouse they are to capture 6 miles away.Although Dana Andrews is listed as the nominal star of the film, the scenes are divided up equally among several men each with their own take on the mission and ultimately the war.Other than Andrews(approaching the peak of his career as Sgt Tyne)the rest of the cast were young up and comers, many who went on to great acting careers. They included Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges(his first important role), John Ireland, George Tyne, Huntz Hall(on hiatus from the East Side Kids films and very effective) and Norman Lloyd(bitterly brilliant as Archambeau).  There is an understated narration by Burgess Meredith and a folk ballad score sung by Earl Robinson.  They all perfectly fit in to the pictureThe key player in all of this is director Lewis Milestone.  A veteran of films since the twenties, his credits included All Quiet On The Western Front, The Front Page, and Of Mice and Men.  In A Walk In The Sun a Milestone independent production he incorporated the successful elements of the other three and the result is one of the greatest of it's genre. It is a movie not to be missed.

It is an intelligent and honest film about men in war; no heroics, no jingoism, no evil enemy, just regular Joes who are caught up in something big and deadly and would rather be home, but are doing their job. There are no clich√©s, no obligatory guy from Brooklyn, no high sounding phrases, no patriotic slogans, just an honest and realistic depiction of strictly ordinary guys caught in war. Lewis Milestone, the director, obviously understood the combat soldier.I love the dialog, the banter among the men of a fighting platoon, especially that between Pvts Rivera, played by Richard Conte, and Friedman, played by George Tyne. Coincidentally, Dana Andrews, one of my favorite actors, character is Sgt. Tyne. I wonder what was made of that by actor George Tyne. The cast also includes a young Lloyd Bridges and Huntz Hall, in the only roll I can recall seeing him in outside the East Side Kids/ Bowery Boys films.The novel by Harry Brown, from which the film was made, was republished a few years ago and the dialog in the film is lifted straight out of it, which is part of what makes the film so great. In fact, this is one of those rare cases where the movie follows the book faithfully, almost to the letter.I was nine years old when this film was released and I well remember the night I first saw it. My parents, who have just celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, thought it was a romance film. I didn't want to go but when we arrived at the old Westmore Theater, now long gone, which was in walking distance of our home, and I saw the lobby photos and saw it was a war film, I was the one delighted. There was always at least one scene from these films that stayed in my mind over the years and in this one it was the hand of the German soldier with the ring on it hanging out of the wrecked armored vehicle, and the assault on the farmhouse.It was just a little walk in the warm Italian sun, but it wasn't an easy thing.An excellent film made from an excellent novel with an excellent cast, all making an excellent viewing experience.

The first time I saw it was in 1948 and I did not see it again until a  few years ago when AMC and the History channel started to show it again.  I watch it every chance I get.  The cast is excellent with many of the actors becoming more popular in later years. This movie offers excellent insight into what makes people tick. The platoon making its way inland during the invasion of Italy offers insight into what a farmer, school teacher, etc. considers important in life.  One scene which I believe describes the futility of war is where the farmer determines that the soil is worthless.  The cerebral fellow (John Ireland) states simply that it is because too many soilders have walked over it for too many years (centuries).I especially like how John Ireland writes letters in his head and hopes to write them on paper later.  I also like the part where Lloyd Bridges starts laughing because he suddenly feels like a little kid when planting explosives on a bridge. The confident Sergeant ( Dana Andrews)  shows fear when about to give the command to launch the attack on the farmhouse.The fast talking dialogue between Richard Conte and his buddy remind me of people we have met.  This is an excellent movie. I believe that most people would appreciate this movie, whether or not they watch war movies.  This movie offers a lot of insight into human nature.The movie is practically void of blood and gore and leaves it to the imagination of the viewer, such as when the Lieutenant is seriously wounded while on board the landing craft, with half of  his face missing.

American infantry platoon lands at Salerno, Italy in 1943 and has orders to capture and hold a farmhouse some miles ahead. The men don't know nothing about what is waiting for them. Will the enemy open fire right at the beach and kill all of them? Will there be mines? Who is their enemy anyway, Germans or Italians? Will they get strafed by enemy aircraft of will 'our boys' control the skies? These are questions that a regular infantryman may ask from himself. They don't know what is waiting for them and they try to guess what the overall situation is. The movie is lots of talking, waiting and walking by the Italian countryside. The soldiers must be alert at all times and there may be false alarms too. Action comes suddenly and is also quickly committed.This is another of those war movies that can be called 'realistic'. In many post-modern war movie realism is seen as a synonym of lots of blood and dying soldiers yelling 'mommy' and such. I don't call that realism - these men know exactly how to deal with disturbing things that war contains. They ignore things that they cannot emotionally handle and this must also be the way those things were handled in real war. This may well be seen as a dull movie, but it also shows the war as it really was. There is no pathos at all in this movie and that is why many people like it.

Unlike most war movies, this is infantry combat as seen through the eyes of several members of a platoon as it walks through the Italian countryside in 1943 on its way to seize a German observation post. In all the action sequences, you never see anything that the individual soldier (German, Italian or American) depicted on the screen doesn't see. You only see what is happening around him as he sees it. I've seen them all, and no other director ever approached war filming this way. And I can tell you personally that this is the way it was in combat. The only errors in the entire movie involved grenades you don't blow bridges with them and you don't pull their pins with your teeth--that's the best way I know of pulling out a tooth w/o a dentist's helping hand. A landmark movie made during the war and only released after the war ended in 1945 because of the final scenes.

It showed more of the reality of war than the string of patriotic we-can-do-it slap-the-Jap stun-the-Hun movies, mostly nonsensical tripe made during the war years. There are no John Wayne heroics here, no superhuman commandos, just the poor bloody infantry. They are just a platoon of fairly ordinary men on a mission to march to a farmhouse and occupy it. It is not that Hollywood staple of the mission that could change the course of the war. They lose their lieutenant. They take casualties from planes, maybe even their own planes. The sergeant who takes over the lead breaks down. They keep going. They talk - a lot. But what talk it is! It is the talk of soldiers. Commonplace stuff, where do you come from, what are you going to do after the war, do the brass know what they're doing, gimme a cigarette. The song that opens and closes the movie makes a point that is perhaps the point of the movie when it links them to soldiers of other places and times.Incidentally, it is fun to look at the cast. Most of the major players in this movie were at the beginning of long and successful careers, notably Dana Andrews, Lloyd Bridges and Norman Lloyd. (Just another thought - after seeing Saving Private Ryan, I realized that Steven Spielberg has seen A Walk in the Sun at least as many times as I have.) My uncle, a veteran of Tunisia who went into Salerno as a Ranger, hated most war films, but not this one. He also told me that his company had a fight with a German armored car very similar to the one with the halftrack in this film.

Within its celluloid record there clambers cold history. The tanks are real. The planes are real. The people are real. This was a contemporary war movie to the actual war, without the layers of myth laquered by years of failing memory.Unlike recent high budget over-the-top productions and the copious blood spattering within, this little epic tends to mute the violence into the pathos of the moment of death. That being the death of heroes. And the emphasis appears to hinge on the suddenness, the randomness, and the tragedy of men dying hard. It is a stark memorial to the courage and sacrifice of the World War II soldier.Amazingly, and very much in contrast to most other war films of the period which demonized the enemy, this film provides a neutral texture to the foe. Here the German soldiers are but shadows on the cave wall. The stray Italian soldiers appear as comic sidekicks in the maelstrom of a nation at peril from two sides. The enemy appears to escape the moral condemnation that other films embraced. This is war and this is what it is by those who fought it.The film describes the landings of an infantry platoon on the Salerno beaches in Italy. All of a sudden they are left leaderless as two of the senior officers meets a soldier's fate. The beach scene remains a descriptive detail of what a soldiers paradox in modern warfare was. They bring the war but they do not know where it is, where they are, whether the war will visit them, or what lies in front of them. Without the need for special effects the director garnishes the film with the fog of war skillfully.A startling moment is when the third ranking leader, a noncom sargeant succumbs to panic and shell shock. It is perhaps the kindest treatment of the condition ever presented cinematically during that period. The rest of the platoon appears to be supportive to the fallen insane sargeant. But the war goes on. They move on.Rallied by a solid sargeant the platoon moves onto its objectives, a bridge and a farmhouse at a cost. The objectives are difficult and the angst of leadership and follower play the scene well. And unlike most war movies where heroism goes beyond definition, these heroes are all very much afraid.The film has a solid core of young actors of the period. Dana Andrews, a very young Lloyd Bridges appear to anchor the cast. The black and white format suits this tiny epic. The cinematography, stunts are solid and consistently well done. It is a darkish film very much worth seeing.

A Walk in the Sun is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone, utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera. It's unusually poetic, for the time, courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen. And, certainly, the film should grow in stature, over the years, when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era. Upon release, the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its realism. Presently, this strength is weighted. Still, the film's substance endures...Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers. Two stand out, and give the film greater emotional depth. Though it begins, necessarily, as a team effort, reluctant Dana Andrews (as Bill Tyne) emerges as the hero; and, John Ireland (as Windy Craven) stands out among the other soldiers. Mr. Andrews is the man who takes command, after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure. Andrews is terrific; especially, note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor.Mr. Ireland's performance, as a poetic minister's son, is award-worthy. Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you the farmer, the prophet&#x85; accompanied by an almost too sentimental, heart-tugging soundtrack. But, however you try to resist, it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell, as he explains G.I. Dirt, and writes letters home in his head. While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission, it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan. The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting, talking, teamwork, and action during war. ******** A Walk in the Sun (12/3/45) Lewis Milestone ~ Dana Andrews, John Ireland, Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges "},{"Title":"Class film about the American G.I. in WWll","Date":"11 January 2005","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" I read Walk when I was 8 or 9.

He ought to know. A Walk in the Sun is full of banter, all of it low brow but keen as well.The dialog is mostly stylized, along the lines of, say, Hemingway or Charles Portis' True Grit, although it is not imitative in any way. I wouldn't trust you with a popgun, says Friedman to Rivera. You gotta trust me. I'm a machine gunner with a machine gun. And somehow, despite the artistic effects, as if the lines were in blank verse, the dialog rings true to life among a small group of men with a superordinate goal. Dana Andrews' Sgt. Tyne is standing alone at the beach, next to the body of his friend, a harmless medic. He lights a cigarette, says aloud, Gee, I'm scared, slings his weapon and walks off towards the thing that is frightening him. What a concise and very human admission. Gee, I'm scared. The artistic effects of the dialog are echoed in the direction by Lewis Milestone, full of silhouettes and inserts, but they don't distract for a moment from our involvement in the story. In the opening scenes the men are packed into a landing craft approaching the beach at Salerno. They are mostly silent and thoughtful except when muttering brief remarks to one another or to themselves. (There are lots of soliloquies in this film.) We see hardly any of the scene except for dimly lighted faces. Sometimes during exchanges we don't even see the faces, only a glistening helmet. And sometimes the screen is completely black.Milestone has been criticized as being too obvious, but I've never understood why. How many other directors would pass up a chance to show us dive bombers attacking troop ships. All we hear are the defensive boom-boom-booms of the 40 mm. guns and the explosions when a ship is hit. And all we see of the battle is a roiling plume of black smoke rising from behind a dune.It's really an ensemble movie, with Dana Andrews the lead figure. We get to know the men pretty well, all of them distinguished from one another by their characters, not by the use of facile props like mustaches. Sometimes they're pretty funny. During a break, one infantryman holds up a leaf and inspects it. He remarks to Huntz Hall's lowbrow that it's a wonderfully designed object. Huntz Hall puts him down and posits dismissively that there's nuthin' so special about a leaf. He's seen lots of leaves.The men are identified only as belonging to a Texas division, and the landing seems to be at Salerno. Salerno was a botched landing. The enemy were all prepared because there was virtually no other place for the landings to be made. The beach head was probably saved by air support and naval gunfire.I've kind of emphasized the dreamlike banter that the author of the novel was so fond of, yet this is a film with quite a bit of action. The final attack on the farmhouse really IS enough to scare Dana Andrews -- or anybody else -- and it's staged with Milestone's signature panning shots.Good movie.

S.L.A. Marshall and Stephen Ambrose have long noted how each soldier has an isolated view of combat with absolutely no idea of what is going on outside of his or her immediate area (I wonder who won says Richard Beymer near the end of The Longest Day).This movie stays with that view throughout, leaving the generals' the philosophers' and the politicians' views to others. Run, walk, crawl and dig in. Often smell and hearing are more useful senses than sight in guessing what's going on. Death and emotional breakdown are almost routine, part of the job. Younger viewers may note the influences of this movie on so many others, and the TV shows that followed, from Altman's Combat episodes to Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. The soldier's view of combat on Omaha Beach in Private Ryan, is one example. Compare in both movies the sharp banter between the ethnically diverse foot soldiers as they walk along towards inevitable danger, whether farmhouse or antenna installation.

The touch that allowed Lewis Milestone to make All Quiet on the Western Front one of the finest movies of its genre is also evident here. Things are presented in a straightforward fashion, with barely a comment on most of what happens, allowing you to have your own honest reactions to events.The story lets you see follow one morning of action in World War II Italy, seeing everything as if you were with the platoon that the movie follows. The 'big picture' is missing entirely, just as it undoubtedly was for most of the fighting men most of the time. They barely know what will happen next, much less what might happen when they reach their objective. Milestone's story-telling skills make this approach work very well, maintaining the tension both in the occasional action scenes and in the dialogue-heavy sequences.The cast includes many good character actors, and the characters are a believable assortment without a lot of stock figures. Dana Andrews does a fine, understated job as the sergeant with the most crucial responsibilities, and many of the other actors have some good moments as well. Some are likable, and some are deliberately annoying; none are heroic, but all are ready to do their jobs.The operation and some of its tactics are no doubt stylized slightly for cinematic effect, but the story works very well. There are, of course, other World War II movies with more action, bigger budgets, and more complex stories, but the very simplicity of A Walk in the Sun is one of its strengths. For a couple of hours, you live and struggle with a group of believable characters, and for a while their world is your world. That's a good indication that the movie has succeeded in its objective.

The cast is excellent, and - although the language is toned down compared to post-1960s films, as with Richard Conte's character using the expletive loving where a more recent film would use a cruder synonym - one has the sense of being there with the group of GIs, with the same constricted vision of what is happening. This is not a grand epic. It is not the more modern grittier down-and-dirty story; but it is as close to what happened to the platoon depicted as a 1945 movie could get.

I thought the film had some of the overtones of Saving Private Ryan in that it focuses on the men in the fighting unit, and eschews the mock heroics that typically characterise the John-Wayne-Hollywood approach to the war film. The film often comes across as a stage play transferred to film, with insightful and thoughtful dialogue, and also a number of good monologues. It isn't a slam-bang action film, and because it isn't, it appears to capture the nature of infantry warfare, warfare generally perhaps, as long stretches of boredom punctuated by short intervals of sheer terror. Most impressive is the fact that the film is an ensemble piece, as I imagine warfare is, although with leaders and followers both. All of the actors come across as interesting and complex characters, individuals all. Some of the dialogue is quite funny. Dana Andrews, Richard Conte and John Ireland stand out, but they in no way hog the film, and it was particularly satisfying to see Huntz Hall in a straight role for a change. There are only three drawbacks that I saw in the film. One occurs when the soldiers are crouching behind a wall and an enemy bullet richochets off the stone with the silly twang sound that characterises western movies - lead bullets don't make that kind of noise. Another occurs early in the film when the unit is strafed by a German fighter plane - the plane, though, looks very much like a P-51 Mustang, an American aircraft. The final drawback is in the rousing band music at the film's end -to my sensibilities, that music was utterly out of place, and clashed badly with the overall sober and serious tone of the piece.

It' remarkably disturbing and dark, about a bunch of soldiers landing at night in Italy, World War II. The sun does eventually rise, but it's an eerie and claustrophobic and surprisingly gentle twenty minutes. The cast is really perfect, without any overly macho guys, just some ordinary men with feelings, feelings for life, for each other little by little, and for a kind of fatalistic fear that turns into acceptance at times, until events force them into action.Once toward halfway, the movie becomes a more conventional, a large rambling group of foot soldiers a bit lost as to what to do as they walk along, in the sun, in Italy. They talk without a lot of open fear, including a bit of chitchat even as they confront enemies of one kind or another. There is an air of ordinary resignation through it all, as if the movie makers knew the audience could only handle a kid gloves kind of truth about the war, which was still raging when it was released. Even though there is an inevitable sense that the Americans were winning (they were landing in Italy, not being pushed off to sea), there is also the sense that these really nice guys might die, suddenly, because of events beyond their control.By the final third a military objective clarifies, a small one, but a potentially deadly one. When it plays out, it's more about war, and winning. The enemy is never shown, and the brutality is limited to the last two minutes, but it's a devastating two minutes, and probably too difficult for audiences to watch at the time while the war was going on. Though filming was finished in January 1945, the film wasn't released officially until December, with six months of peace already healing some of the wounds, and didn't see wide release until the following year, long after war films had stopped being made. Director Milestone did get Army approval for the film in 1945, and it does seem accurate in its awfulness, even now. It's right before the climax that the film returns to it extraordinary, inner conscience, following Dana Andrews crawling though the weeds to the farmhouse they intend to overtake. How long would it take to crawl around the world? A hundred years? A thousand years?For the best this film has, it's essential, a major piece of war filmmaking.

In some ways you could consider it ahead of it's time. The characters have flaws, there is a reference to battle fatigue, and heroes die.To be sure, the clich√©s abound, but they lay them out early in the introduction. A couple of wise guys from Brooklyn (and Jersey City), the yokel, the farmer, the poet, etc. But to their credit, they cast believable actors in the relevant parts. Interestingly, they cast Richard Conte as a wisecracking gunner, and Norman Lloyd as a scout. Both were Jersey City natives and added an air of authenticity to the production. I lived in Jersey City for a while and I can tell you that I could have met these guys at any gin mill in Journal Square and wouldn't have been surprised. Most of the rest of the cast was just as authentic.To be sure, there are problems with the script, but most of them had to do with the constrictions of the times. Hoist tail. Get it? The loving army, the loving food, the loving etc. What do you want for 1945? Maybe it was even a little provocative for the times.This movie was part of a transition from the standard WW2 propaganda efforts like Sands of Iwo Jima, Bataan, etc, to a more rational presentation of the horror of war. We hadn't yet progressed to the anti-war era of Platoon or Apocalypse Now, but we were getting there.

Isolated, claustrophobic, wise-cracking, fatalistic. Very little discussion of strategy, very little 'big picture', very little 'why we fight'. From a grunt's point-of-view, the story is always the same how do we get from point 'A' to point 'B', do our job and what will be the cost? For the individual soldier or Marine, this is what it always boils down to one foot in front of the other, protect yourself, protect the guy next to you, do your job. Milestone knew this. It suffuses All Quiet on the Western Front, it permeates Pork Chop Hill. Life in a combat zone can be intense and terrifying but it is mostly tedious and boring. Usually you don't know anything, nobody tells you anything, maybe because they don't know either. You can only see as far as the next hill, the next treeline. The sound of distant gunfire, the rumble of bombs or artillery, what does it mean, who is it, everybody looks and wonders but no one knows. Seemingly endless physical labor, dirt and heat, noise and near silence, sometimes only the sound of your own boots, the sound of your own digging, sudden gunfire, a plane, a tank, a sniper, dirt in your food, dirt in your mouth, walk some more, sweat. The hours roll by, someone is killed, maybe a friend, surely someone you know, no time for grief, move on, be happy it wasn't you. The individual only needs to know a little slice of the whole, the small unit only needs to know their little corner of the whole, a task, sometimes a near impossible task, time grinds down on the planning, other units are on the move, other men will depend on you completing this task, how to do it? How to survive but still, how to do it. Here Milestone has populated a simple story with a predictable mix of archetypes, almost daring himself to tell a familiar story in a new and fresh way with shopworn components. He has avoided caricature by allowing the characters to develop slowly, to reveal themselves as unique individuals, with histories, with grievances, with hopes, always avoiding the danger of slipping into the maudlin, the sentimental. The dialogue is earthy and believable even though he had to avoid actual profanity but the delivery is rapid and wise. It feels right. The cast is well-suited to the story, a collection of young rising talent, destined for long careers with only Dana Andrews an established 'name'. Some have said it is slow and boring, well, this ain't Stallone or Schwarzenegger. This ain't an 'action' movie. This is the infantry and in the infantry you walk, it is a slow and tedious way to get anywhere but your feet and a dry pair of socks are all you have and there is always a little black cloud sitting on your shoulder.

The lieutenant is killed even before the landing and the various sergeants take over. One of them, Herbert Rudley cracks under the strain, and Dana Andrews assumes overall command of the mission.A Walk in the Sun is not so much a war story as a war character study. It's interesting to contrast this film with Lewis Milestone's masterpiece, All Quiet on the Western Front. Both involve citizen soldiers going to war and both are studies into the types of people making up a platoon. Milestone's sympathies are with both, but he does recognize the necessity for the trip to Europe made by these Americans in Italy.Best in the film in my opinion is Richard Conte, the cynical wisecracking GI from, where else, Brooklyn. According to Hollywood, there wasn't a platoon in any theater of war in the forties that did not have a GI from Brooklyn.

That was war. That was always war. It was confused and it was incoherent and it was unreasonable. Nothing ever happened quite on time, nothing ever happened exactly as was expected. War, itself a paradox, was full of paradoxes. A platoon of men, in on the first landing on an enemy coast, could be completely bypassed by events. They could sit in a hollow while all around them things went, or should be going, according to plan, and while the platoon, itself an integral part of the whole operation, seemed to be entirely forgotten. Yet had the platoon been unnecessary, it might well have found itself caught underneath shells and planes. ... But mostly, war builds patience. For war is a dull business, the dullest business on earth. War is a period of waiting. Each day of it is crammed with the little hesitations of men uncertain of themselves and awed by the ghastly responsibilities &#x96; the responsibilities of life and death, the responsibilities of gods &#x96; that have been thrust into their hands. The soldier waits for food, for clothing, for a letter, for a battle to begin. And often the food never is served, the clothing is never issued, the letter never arrives, and the battle never begins. The soldier learns to wait meekly, hoping that something will happen. And when the period of waiting is at an end, the something that does happen isn't what he expected. So in the end he learns to wait and expect nothing. That is patience, God's one great gift to the soldier. But he refuses to confess his patience. He curses the fact that he has to wait. He howls at those who cause the waiting. And that too is good, in a way. For the man who waits silently is not a good soldier. He is no more than a stone. - Harry Brown (excerpt from A Walk In The Sun) Harry Brown wrote A Walk In The Sun in 1944, one of literatures great WW2 novellas. Brown, like Joyce, Hemingway and Mailer, other major war writers of the era, all had a terse, abrupt, economical, minimalist, gruff way with words &#x96; their prose flew like bullets, abrupt and to the point - possibly influenced by the unadorned style demanded by newspapers. Think the pulp poetry of Sam Fuller's war movies and you have their tone.Lewis Milestone directed many war films (All Quiet On The Western Front, Halls of Montezuma, Pork Chop Hill), most of which muddle together two entirely divergent and contradictory messages. Take Pork Chop Hill, for example, a film about the Korean War which ignores the Korean War and instead curries favour with 1959 audiences by invoking the fears and necessities of the Cold War, a stance which needs to predict an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome and outlook. Since the substitution of the Cold War for the Korean War was deemed by Milestone incapable of being acknowledged, the film displays an ambivalence towards the entire Korean conflict and its consequences. So on one hand he wants to celebrate the soldiers of the Cold War, a war which he sees as necessary, whilst also mourning the loss of those who died and were squandered in the Korean conflict (historically a part of the Cold War), a stance which predicts a pessimistic, even a tragic outcome and outlook. This is a common dichotomy in war films; Celebratory vs Tragedy it is in this fashion that most war films (most notably those which proclaim themselves to be antiwar) veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda.So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's A Walk In The Sun remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing &#x96; his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts &#x96; can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose &#x96; take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf &#x96; but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller).Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s.7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

Led by Sgt. Bill Tyne (Dana Amdtrews), they manage to blow up a bridge, destroy an armored car and capture a farmhouse in occupied Italy in 1943. There are an array of good supporting performances, notably from Lloyd Bridges as a no- nonsense farmer perpetually dreaming of an apple, Richard Conte as Private River, perpetually cadging a butt (cigarette) from one of his fellow-soldiers, and Norman Lloyd as a skillful navigator of difficult terrain suffering from advanced sleep deprivation. Lewis Milestone's film does not shy away from portraying the seamier side of war Sgt. Eddie Porter (Herbert Rudley) fights one battle too many and eventually collapses to the ground in nervous exhaustion. Other platoon members perish in their attempts to capture the targets. Russell Harlan's photography is little short of brilliant as he tracks the platoon moving through woodland or crawling on their stomachs in order to reach the farmhouse. There are some clever editing devices, notably the zoom into a map spread out in front the troops, followed by a zoom out to begin a new scene; or the deliberately blurred point of view shot from Andrews' perspective as he looks at the farmhouse to be captured, while trying to stave off his exhaustion. Sometimes director Milestone uses the telling close-up to make his point about the effects of war; a dead hand hanging limply over a wall, a human face staring impassively at the camera; the face of one of the troops filling the screen. The music - by Fredric Efren Rich - comprises a series of calypsos, not only rooting the film in popular culture, but communicating a message about the importance of freedom. Definitely a high-profile film - as denoted by the use of the book that opens and closes the film, suggesting that this film aspires to quasi-literary status.

The character acting is marvellous, the dialogue interesting and well-written and the story well scripted. Yes it's a bit slow, and you get to read an awful lot of thoughts in people's heads, as it were, but for me this was part of the film's magic, as the reality of an infantryman obviously has little enough to do with guns going off, and lots more to do with time being spent waiting for the shooting to start. Nevertheless, the battle scenes are also well done and there is some interesting camera-work and other technical features that cine fans will appreciate.Thoroughly enjoyable and quite suitable for younger people of high school age, who might learn a great deal if they listen carefully, but who might also find it a bit too slow moving.

Well, nothing less than one of the most personal views of war since All Quiet (1930)...Deeply introspective, deceptively comedic, disturbingly real, this account of one day in the life and death of a platoon of American soldiers landing at Salerno in Italy, in 1943, must rank as one of the most poignant snapshots of war ever put to film, and, in my opinion, an excellent example of how to make good cinema &#150; despite the bells and whistles, so to speak, for that time the narration by Burgess Meredith and the ballad sung by Kenneth Spencer (who sounds uncannily like Paul Robeson, I think). Those two aspects certainly date this production, more or less, if you didn't know it was made in 1945. Hollywood was, at those times, very big on ballads with dramas; need I say Gene Autry, Roy Rodgers et al?Some might even be bored with the long introduction to the landing, when the viewer is introduced to each of the main characters by way of their interaction with others; or as whimsical introspection as some, like Pvt. Craven (John Ireland), contemplate the nature of life, death and the whole damn thing. In succession, the viewer knows the quiet strength and honesty of Sgt. Tyne (Dana Andrews); the hip repartee between Pvts Rivera and Friedman (Richard Conte & George Tyne); the earthy homeliness of Sgt Ward (Llyod Bridges); the innocence of Pvt Judson (Steve Brodie); and many other well known character actors who were the mainstays of so many black and white classics of that time.The platoon's mission is simple advance to the enemy lines to a certain farmhouse a few miles inland; attack and kill/capture the enemy; and secure the position. Simple enough, except that the platoon lieutenant is killed before landing, forcing the top sergeant Eddie Porter (Herbert Rudley) to take over. Unhappily, his nerves are shredded from too much battle fatigue, and shortly after, he's reduced to tearful inaction, thus forcing another change in leadership to Sgt. Tyne who then rallies the men to get the job done. It's a dramatic scenario that must have happened in real life, maybe many times.The dialog is the best aspect of this story, no question, showing just how ordinary men do act and think to keep their courage and sanity in desperate situations, knowing that their next step might be their last, but ready to do their duty come what may. I know that sounds corny and maybe it is, but without some sense of the need to get a dangerous job done &#150; even at the highest personal cost &#150; there can be no victory over evil. In its small way, this movie encapsulates all that is honourable about the human spirit while also exploring its limits. A contrasting example &#150; but a very similar story line and mise-en-scene &#150; was Attack (1956), a gripping psychological tussle between Jack Palance, Lee Marvin and Eddie Albert, also in a remote farm house. For younger viewers than I, a more recent comparison that comes to my mind is Malick's The Thin Red Line (1998), an account of a battle for a hilltop on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands &#150; and again, very much under the sun. I'd recommend both of those films also.Some would argue, perhaps, that the production standards of this film were clunky, even laughably fake. They would be those who can't see the wood for the trees a cast of characters so real that you can see part of yourself in every one of them with no difficulty at all. And as the narrative unfolds on that very ordinary day, I was in fact caught thinking about the limits of my own courage when faced with the ever present shadow of death...So, I guess I can fault the production for using what looked like P51 Mustangs as German or Italian fighters; I can raise an eyebrow at the low budget special effects; or the unaccountable lack of sweat on any of the soldiers as they walk in the sun, for Pete's sake, for a whole day...But you can't ignore the sheer honesty of the narrative; the stark black-and-white photography; the great tracking shots used in battle; or the quick and very effective cuts between different pairs of soldiers as they discuss whatever soldiers discuss during battle and during the lulls that form the bulk of all soldiers' stories.If you are a fan of the war genre, this is a must-see movie.

Except for a couple of touchingly unusual scenes, the war story plays more like a series of WWII clich√©s. The real problem is that the narrative never really conveys the emotional trauma of war. Yes, men we like are killed, but we're not made to feel the loss. Instead the deaths never make the emotional jump from screenplay to gut-level contact. In fact, the whole movie seems oddly detached from the horrors of war&#x97;it's like Milestone doesn't really engage with the material, filming instead in an impersonal manner (Contrast with the intensity of All Quiet on the Western Front 1930).However, giving the ordinarily clownish Sterling Holloway (McWilliams) a straight role as the ill-fated medic proved a daring stroke of inspiration. The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations.Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree.(In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

HA!","Date":"25 July 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" This is not the worse war movie I have ever seen, but it ranks right down there at the bottom.I am totally and utterly dumbfounded by the comments that say that this is a realistic war movie. I agree that it is very different (not much combat action, lots of small talk, off screen combat, on screen tension), but to say that the move is realistic is ridiculous. I could write forever about the unrealism, but here are just a few items.1. The lieutenant gets killed at the outset, so command passes down to three battle-hardened combat sergeants,. . . who then spend the rest of the movie crying, confused, unable to lead, unable to read maps, uncertain what to do, uncertain how to command, and having existential anxiety. Indeed, this appears to be the fundamental theme of the entire movie! (They should rename it The Crying Sergeants). I've got big news for you. Combat platoons are run and commanded by the sergeants. They are the most competent men and leaders in combat. Young officers, on the other hand, such as lieutenants, are typically hapless and routinely get men killed by not knowing how to command. The mission in this movie (march 6 miles inland down a farm road and destroy a farm house marked on a map) would be business as usual for any combat sergeant. These guys acted like it was the Manhattan Project!!!2. In the middle of the movie, in a combat situation, a sergeant issues a direct order to a private to deliver a message to another soldier. The private replies, Go tell him yourself! Realism??? You've got to be kidding me!! Do you have any idea what would have happened both then (and now) if a soldier said this to a sergeant in combat?? It would start off with a really good beating, and end in the soldier having to walk point (suicide) for the rest of the mission. 3. Each and every soldier has the exact battle dress on, including carry bags and ammo belts, regardless of rank or weapons. Guys carrying little M-1 carbines are wearing ammo belts designed for the large Garand rifle ammo. Guys carrying Thompson submachine guns are wearing the same. Realism??? Only in Hollywood.4. At the climax, 50 troops with rifles charge across an open field at a stone farmhouse containing three German machine guns. The machine guns blaze away, and only a few troops fall! Realism?? This charge would have been suicide, with all killed! The lone American machine gun (blazing away from a stone wall 200 yard away to support the charge) would have killed more Americans than Germans. What would they have really done in this scenario? They would have surrounded the farmhouse, pinned down the occupants, and then called for support. (Either air or armor.)5. Fifty men are sent inland on a mission, and nobody has a radio? Since their landing was uncontested, they clearly didn't leave it with the dead in the surf. Geez, . . . I guess they just plain forgot to bring one!!!When I see a movie like this, I just don't know what to think. The only people who would categorize this movie as realistic would be Artsie folks, who seem to know nothing about combat, firearms, or the military, and who seem to totally confuse the concept of small-talk dialogue among privates with realism. I am sorry, but they are not the same thing.

The movie begins in the dark early hours, in landing craft headed for the Italian coast, dialogue ensues. The platoon's Lt, is injured and eventually dies, leaving a number of sergeants to lead the platoon to the objective. More dialogue follows. Eventually they hit the beaches uncontested and dig so they can talk about nothing. In one of the few action scenes of the film, a medic (Holloway) is killed by a strafing plane, and more talk follows. They move inland all while talking and come across some deserting Italian soldiers. The token Italian American is able to speak to them and they get some info about the area. After more long winded chat of no importance, they get ready to hit a German half track. One of the sergeants basically wets his pants, cries, and can't fight. They blow up the half track and move on to the all important farmhouse. After much talk, they attempt to hit it, and they fail. They come up with a foolhardy plan to take the place. With much less casualties then would have actually happened, they manage to take the house and talk some more.I have to say this is one of the most disappointing war films I have ever scene. I'm amazed with a cast like this the film came out so poorly, in virtually every aspect. Lloyd Bridges seems to stand out by far and even his character is a bore. The real problem with the film is there is too much needless boring dialogue. Everyone knows to have a good film you need a good script and dialogue, the problem is that almost all of it is pointless. They attempted to show you what the average Joe would be talking about while he's out on patrol. But it becomes tedious and extremely boring, with dialogue if you're not outright laughing at for being so poor, you may just be fast forwarding. For instances some have said how real the dialogue is. Yet, near the end, they have just lost some men, are under fire and don't know how their going to take the farmhouse. So with no real emotion the one guy starts up a conversation about how a leaf off the ground is more complex than the human body. If it sounds stupid, it is. His first thoughts would be is he going to see his family again or live to see another day. Other ones are equally as silly, about dirt, apples, and how one man wants to be hit man after the war. The only scene that was good was when they talk to the Italians to get some information. It comes off well. But I haven't mentioned characters, because they are ones that no one could care about. I couldn't even give you a name. Although you really never see them, you will probably be begging for the Germans to attack just so something happens in the film. The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era.Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case.I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.

In one of the few action scenes in the movie, the Americans get straffed by a P-51, which is an American plane.I picked this DVD up in a bargain bin for $6. It wasn't worth it. On top of the miserable movie itself, the encoding quality is extemely poor. There are lots of places where you can see pixelation. At one point there is a big purple spot on the screen, which really sticks out since the movie is black and white.After enduring it for about an hour, I couldn't take it any more and had to turn the movie off. Save your money. This one is a real stinker. "}]
