[{"Title":"An Intense Drama Featuring a Gritty Performance from its star...","Date":"2 May 2007","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" EXTREMITIES is the disturbing, yet riveting screen version of a play by William Mastriosimone (who adapted his own play for the screen) about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a would-be rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives. After her roommates leave for work the next day, the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her. The story takes a surprising twist when, at one point, the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him; but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested, he will just get off, she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him. Far-fetched? Maybe. Disturbing? Definitely, but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film, especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker, that you can't help but feel completely a part of what's going on. I did not see the play on Broadway, but I would imagine a piece like this works better onstage, but that doesn't make this film any less riveting an experience. Farrah Fawcett, one of the last actresses to do the role on Broadway, was awarded the role of Marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim. Many critics found Fawcett's performance to be one-note, but for me, Marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me. James Russo, in the performance of his career, is slimy and menacing as the would-be rapist who finds Marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid co-star as Marjorie's roommates, who come home after Marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival. And it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw Marjorie go through and therefore, think she should call the police and let them handle the guy. Not for the faint of heart, but if you can stand it, a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you.

To my recollection, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's, and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time.Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed, then stalked by actor James Russo. He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but at times a bit transparent.Diana Scarwid has a bit role, as does Alfre Woodard as the house mate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. The scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at Russo is classic, and as the rapist he deserves it. She then keeps him in bondage, and the consequences must be faced.A very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated, physically, and mentally. Highly recommended. 8/10.

What is believable is that pig would have been released, even with a confession that was circumstantial at best, an attorney would have had a field day with that. She had a knife to his throat so it didn't mean anything.More over, it is perfectly legal to kill an intruder in your home, whether they're there to rape you or still your freaking television.

Well done to Farrah for being a Golden Globe 'Best Actress' nominee.When her rapist Joe (played in a rather frightening and intense fashion by Farrah's co-star James Russo) enters her home - (which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out) - Marjorie has to play along with Joe's frightening demands, before the tables are finally turned and Marjorie gets the upper hand. It does make for some disturbing and shocking scenes.Both Fawcett and Russo had played these characters on the New York stage prior to this film adaptation, and both actors show their ability in carrying out emotionally charged scenes with admirable tenacity. Alongside her work in the 1984 film The Burning Bed, Extremities shows that Fawcett can push out the boundaries and show us her skills as a serious actress and not just be remembered as a lightweight Charlie's Angel. 8/10 "},{"Title":"High level rape film, a winner for our late Farrah","Date":"13 February 2013","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Extremities is a story of a man, overwhelmed with guilt, one that has proved to be fatal, turning him killer. When first learning of this film, back at the start of '87, I thought it was just about some psycho getting his kicks, raping women. Little did I know. Our rapist, Joe has already raped a score of women and disposed of em'. Only his latest, Marjorie (Fawcett in a great dramatic performance) has managed to escape when first car jacked and driven to a deserted underpass. Marjorie explains her situation to the police, none too helpful, where the police woman tells her straight, there's a chance he could get off. Farrah's even mistaken for a hooker by a young cop, who interrupts the not so progressing well conversation. She leaves, irate, and by not signing this certain form, the cops can't take action. The rapist has got her wallet with her id, so we know what's gonna ensue. We too see Joe, has a family where he has been kept pretty faceless up to this point. When he's in his little shed, examining Farrah's id, his cute little daughter knocks on the glass, informing him, dinner's almost ready. So now with Farrah, it's a waiting game. Her two housemates, Patti and Terri, have been informed of the situation. Even when the pizza guy, comes delivering a meal, Farrah is rather surly, when he asks if the three of them live together, which is understandable. Then days later, low and behold, a man freely enters her house, asking after a Joe. And from here, the real drama and suspense begins, claustrophobic, one would say, as Russo, great here, gets quite physical and cruel, at one point almost threatening to toss a pan of burnt bacon onto her. He also examines her particulars, even making opportunity to indulge in some forced sex, cause in reality, there's no way in hell, she'd go out with this creep of low class status. Keeping with the stage play, she finally turns the tables on the attacker, after luring him on, when on top of her, falsely. She then sprays his eyes with insecticide, cracks a hot glass kettle of coffee over his head, before strangling him and barricading him in a fireplace, from which there is no escape. Not much sooner does her two friends return from work and cross this scene of madness. The two do not agree with her illogical plan of murder, which too could be seen as logical, if this madman gets off. We do weigh these real life options. Scarwid, a great character actress, brings an effervescent, quirky and sexy character as Terri, while the more mature Woodard, gives a very humane and real performance, I liked. She's the only one showing compassion to the not so healthy looking Russo. Farrah at one point, who's taken enough of her, says Why don't you just f..k him. That'll make him feel better. Extremities is a real film of real situations and choices. Even near the end, Scarwid chooses to stay with Russo, when Farrah and co, get the cops, warming up to him some, as hearing his reasons. One particular moment with Farrah running her knife down Russo's lower region, may make you flinch. This is a great dramatic film, that I wouldn't suggest a rape victim should watch. It's all too real, as are the performances, and I'm not just talking the mains. You will feel pretty washed out at the end of this, too, as in these claustrophobic movies. The up tempo music score, at it's opening is all so unfitting though, even though I liked it a lot, so.

Ironically they were good friends, and one thing that Farrah could do instead of Michael, and that was act. She scorches up the screen here, a raging queen of revenge on her attacker, who has come to attack her, for the second time, invading her home. She scarcely escapes the first attack, a car jacking, where they end up in a discreet parking spot. She manages to get away, leaving her car and wallet behind. With not much help from authorities (der, we've seen it so many times before in rape films) it now becomes a game of waiting, with Farrah, quite on edge, and rightfully so. She does share house with two other women. Diana Scarwid, very good as a wild impulsive sort, and Alfre Woodard, as a more wiser black woman, the only one partially sympathetic to the rapist after the tables are turned, and turned they are. Farrah becomes caught in conflict with her mates who return to find Joe, the battered faced rapist chained up in the fireplace. She wants to kill Joe, on the too probable count, that if tried, and he gets off, he will come at her again. This is a real life situation scenario here, Woodard of course, dead set against the idea. For rape victims, this movie is not for you. It's an intense grueling flick about the rape process, where the consequences for a criminal's acts here are extreme (hence the title) for low class sort, Joe (a wonderful Russo) But it's Farrah who engrosses us, where Extremities is an engrossing and with a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere, where indeed it's well shot, where most of the movie is set in Farrah's pad. For some viewers it'll be tough to watch. Too, what's shocking is Russo's admittance, and his intentions, when untied and falling to the floor, where then Scarwid surprisingly becomes sympathetic. Although I really didn't like it's ending Extremities is powerful movie making and far from escapist fare for viewers, wanting to leave reality behind. I would also like to see the play one day, but for now, I'll stick to the movie.

Having to watch a woman on stage being brutalized in her own home by a stranger is not an experience I imagine to be fun. But it is a fascinating and utterly compelling story that leads into some very unexpected directions. In 1986, Extremities became a movie, adapted by Mastrosimone himself. With the incredible performances of Farrah Fawcett and James Russo, some very believable fight choreography, and a tightly woven script, Extremities goes to new extremes as a film.Alone in her car one night, innocent Marjorie is threatened by a man with a knife. Just before he attempts to rape her, she escapes. The bad news is the cops aren't helpful and the criminal has her credentials. He knows where she lives. A week later, Marjorie is home alone while her friends, the attractive Terry and social worker Pat, are away at work. Out of the blue, a man waltzes right into the house and asks Marjorie if a guy named Joe lives there. No matter how many times she tells him No Joe lives here, it becomes evident that this is the man that attacked Marjorie the other night. He beats her, tries to smother her with a pillow, and then tries to rape her again. But he doesn't get away with it when Marjorie sprays him in the face with insect repellent, ties him up, and jails him in the fireplace. But when Terry and Pat come home and there's no proof that the attacker laid a hand on her, Marjorie's only safety net is to keep him locked up until he confesses his sins. If he doesn't, she'll kill him.Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden bears remarkable similarities to Extremities, but Mastrosimone's story works exceptionally well as a film knowing the decade that the film was released in. The same decade produced such crime movies as The Accused and TV's stunner The Burning Bed, another Farrah Fawcett feature. This was when women took hold of their sexuality and wouldn't allow themselves to be exploited by men. Keeping that in mind will allow the viewer of Extremities to connect to the plot, whether they're male or female.The movie also raises several questions about where the line is drawn in terms of justice. If a man rapes or beats a woman, does the victim have a right to physically hurt the other person? Worse if there's no proof of rape, what can the victim do to save herself? Marjorie pulls no punches. She is dead serious about keeping the police out of it and killing this home invader. But with his word against hers, she could go to jail for life. Though she is fully aware of the consequences, she can't allow him to walk away. Extremities is controversial, and gives the viewer plenty to talk about when the movie's over.However, I find it impossible to avoid the movie's rather typical opening, which begins differently from the play. The opening is almost like a B-grade 80's slasher movie, and I'm sure that's not what Mastrosimone was aiming for. But things get much better once we're isolated with Marjorie and the rapist in the house. When he walks through the front door, the guy easily gives us the creeps. We know he's up to something. The tension grows and grows as he commits more embarrassing and painful acts towards Marjorie. When she takes control, the suspense goes together perfectly with the drama, a classy combination for a movie so gritty and violent.In terms of casting, Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young picked up two of the stage production's regulars the beautiful Farrah Fawcett and the alarmingly intimidating James Russo. Fawcett was just breaking free from her Charlie's Angels reputation, and this movie put her on the map. Marjorie is not at all an easy role to play, but Fawcett gladly accepts the challenge. Her performance is booming and simmering with a quiet anger. She makes Marjorie a very sympathetic and frail woman at first. Notice how her voice breaks every time she's about to cry. And when she throws the rapist in the fireplace and threatens him with a shovel, you understand her pain. Fawcett turns Marjorie into a force not to be messed with. How she walked away without an Oscar nomination proves that this woman was one of the most underrated actresses of her time. James Russo is absolutely spine-tingling as the rapist. His beady eyes and twisted smile make your skin crawl every time he's on screen, which is for the majority of the film. He, too, deserves more praise. Alfre Woodard is decent as Pat, but Diana Scarwid's performance as Terry is flawed. It is basically too over-the-top. She cries too much, and her dialog is delivered too unbelievably, her worst case being a monologue about a past encounter with a rapist. What translated so effectively on stage to the public has changed here, and the way Scarwid portrays it, it comes off more as forced subtext than being related to Marjorie's troubles.Does Extremities have its minor quibbles? Of course. Most movies do. But this is a film that plays most of its cards correctly and aims its darts close to the bullseye. If it weren't performed so believably by its leads, the movie wouldn't have nearly as much impact as the play. Movies like this are always more frightening when you realize that it can happen. Mastrosimone's story feels very real, which helps Extremities to be a powerful adaptation.

After subjecting Marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and locks him in the fireplace. What is Marjorie going to do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone concoct a harsh, gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe perceives women strictly as objects while Marjorie only sees Joe as an animal. However, this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make Joe out to be simply a vile one-dimensional creep; instead he's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid (Joe's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant). Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding in the leads; they receive fine support from Diana Scarwid as the passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the sensible Patricia, and Sandy Martin as sympathetic policewoman Officer Sudow. Both Curtis Clark's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's shivery, skin-crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension. A real powerhouse.

After dismantling him and blockading him inside her fireplace, she and her two female roommates struggle with what to do next.This is an all around minimalist thriller that is taut and effective in spite of locale limitations. The film is structured much like the stage play, with the majority of the action taking place in the confines of a living room. Thus, the film is very much dialogue-driven, dependent on strong performances which the cast deliver. Farrah Fawcett is one of the most underrated actresses ever as far as I'm concerned, and her performance in this film is proof of it; she was much more than a pretty face on Charlie's Angels and plastered on the walls of teenage baby boomer boys' bedrooms. James Russo&#x97; who also starred in the stage production with Fawcett&#x97; plays the villain with tenacity and menace that is overtaken in the second act as the film swirls with moral debate between the two other women; Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid provide solid and necessary support here. The real electric chemistry at the crux of the film is between Fawcett and Russo, and this is very likely due to their past experience playing out the narrative onstage together; regardless, both of these performances are honest and believable.Though not exactly a suspense film, there is a high level of tensity maintained throughout; nearly every scene is rife with it. The opening sequence featuring a point-of- view shot from Russo as he stalks potential victims in the night before locking in on Fawcett is especially sinister and almost reminiscent of a slasher film. The denouement follows a jaw-dropping one-to-one between the two leads with a hunting knife and family jewels.Overall, Extremities is a minimalist but solid thriller that works as a thriller and as an acting decathlon for Fawcett and Russo (especially Fawcett). I'd say to see it just for the acting, but there is also a great handling of material here that shapes the source material into a formidable and disturbing adaptation. 8/10.

She can sure as hell prove assault (unless of course, consensual sex includes windows broken FROM THE OUTSIDE)--not in the same class, but better than nothing. But we need The System to be helpless so that Marjorie has to take the law into her own hands, so this doesn't occur to any of the characters.Also, given what they know of the situation, Pat and Terry are way too willing to give Joe the benefit of the doubt. Let's review the facts as they know them1. Marjorie was attacked and almost raped a week before. 2. She escaped, but had to leave her wallet--with her address--behind. Therefore, her attacker now knows where she lives. 3. A total stranger is in their living room fireplace, with bug spray in his eyes and a nice scalp cut near his temple. 4. There's obviously been a fight, because there's broken crockery on the floor and the phones have been yanked out of the wall.So why in the name of God is Pat so willing to hear Joe out??????? Is it really so much of a leap for her to figure out that this is the guy who attacked Marjorie before??????? But we need there to be some doubt in how this will play out, so Pat has to play incredibly dumb and almost fall for Joe's story.All in all, the plot's inherent weakness overshadows very strong performances from the four principals.

Fast forward several days later Fawcett is at the home she shares with her two friends. The two friends head off to their respective jobs, and moments later, Fawcett's attacker arrives at home and proceeds to slap her around and attack her in the most sadistic, brutal (and exploitative) ways. Then, she turns the tables on him. As he has a grip on her, she reaches for a can of bug spray, gets him in the eyes, throws a pot of hot water on him, then proceeds to tie him up and stuff him in the fireplace, figuring out what to do next.At this point, much of what has gone on is remotely suspenseful. However, once the two roommates re-enter the picture, the movie becomes banal, with some horrendous dialogue (mostly shouting matches where idiot and moron are tossed around.) Since there was no actual rape, Fawcett realizes she has no case, and the cops will only let the man free to attack her again. Moreover, she can't make her own roommates believe her. The climax of the film is soap-opera material, and nothing more.I don't feel the need to comment much more on this, except that the ending doesn't ring true, Alfre Woodard has gone on to more worthy projects (Grand Canyon, Down In The Delta), and this one probably should've been left on the stage. A frustrating movie that I can't recommend.

The first half is very disturbing and realistic in its depiction of attackers and rapists. This half could even be seen as an after-school special showing teenagers that Rape is no laughing matter! Farrah Fawcett's character gets threatened, violated, beat up, raped, and humiliated. Her attacker is a married man with children who is a complete sadist in sexual dominance. He makes Farrah cook him some breakfast, touch his genitals, tell him I love you and I want to make love to you while beating her up in the process. This is where the movie really works. It shows the viewer that rape isn't always committed by a strange loner...it can be committed by anyone (Even a happily married man with children. I say happily married because in the beginning of the movie, you can hear the attacker's wife calling him to lunch. It is obvious that his wife, although never seen on screen, has made him a very nice and delicious lunch. You can tell by the tone of her voice). The first half also has us asking questions such as Why would a man do this? and that question has to be answered by the viewer's own opinion because the second half on Extremities falls completely apart. Farrah, with her beautiful strong feet, manages (in a completely impossible situation) to capture her attacker and reverse the role playing. She sprays his eyes with bug spray (which happens to be conveniently by her at the time) then ties and beats him up (yeah....whatever). The question above is never answered because instead of going into deep character studies, the last 45 minutes are close ups of Farrah's feet walking around her captor as her roomates look on wondering if she's really the crazier and more sadistic one. Excellent 51% of the way.

True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo), but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production. Would their final solution hold up in a court of law? Maybe...Based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance, the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine, though Fawcett's overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation.

After a week passes she figures all is good until he strolls into her deluxe pad one morning after her friends have left for work.  Following some bogus story about money owed to him, the guy reveals himself as the would-be rapist and a series of chases and slappings occur throughout the house.  She ends up finding an opening to subdue him at which point the film starts its descent into lameness.  She sticks his banged up body in a fireplace with what looks like a metal headboard as a block, begins digging a grave for him in the backyard(!), and tries to convince her arriving roommates that he'll be let go by the police because there was no rape.  The last 20 minutes are so jumbled that you dont know if they're actually trying to drum up sympathy for the bad guy.  With his injuries and his sob story about his wife, it seemed out of place.  The performances are strong, although Russo, as the attacker, was (unfortunately) reminding me of Tony Danza with that New York accent of his.  Kind of like watching a nasty Whos the Boss? episode. But when he has to be, Russo is very hateful.  Fawcetts good, though a little bitchy in the beginning and a madwoman in the end.  Woodard does a nice job as the sympathetic friend to Russo, but Scarwid's a little too much to handle as the flipped out, babbling roommate.

The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful victim, and the handsome, obviously extremely off-center, blue-collar protagonist (if just short of totally-deranged) - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario.This is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a turning-the-tables story. However, my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama.Her roommates I'm certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don't ring true -- based upon Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred.But this is a film and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director's work.

The credits claim the screenplay was written from a play but there is no screenplay. This is simply the filming of a (fictional) psychopath torturing his victim and then the victim torturing him back. Why would anyone wish to watch this, except for the people who apparently find porno bondage films entertaining? Neither the rapist or the victim fights realistically but that comment suggests that this is a real film. It's not. It's simply an assembly of misery. Farah Fawcett has made some fine films but this is not one of them. Every character in this slop is literally retarded.The whole point of this thing is that any criminal can get away with any crime, as long as there aren't other (besides the victim) witnesses, though that does not apply to the criminal. If a victim tries to (incompetently) torture the criminal back, that does not require witnesses to send her away to the slammer.This wasn't set in America. Was it meant to represent North Korea? The moon? The municipal sewer? Using the film's own logic, why on earth didn't Farah simply get the ax out of her garden shed, chop off both the psychopathic rapist's legs, and then call the police and say he chopped off his own legs while breaking into her house? There'd be no witnesses against Farah so she'd go perfectly free, and yet the rapist couldn't re-terrorize Farrah or any other rape-victims. The why not is because then the film would have been over.Why did Farah's friend and house-mate believe everything that the rapist told her but nothing that Farah told her? This must have been written and filmed by that piece of scum who wrote a book and went on talkshows a few years ago claiming that ALL men are potential rapists and would commit rape, under the right circumstances. This monstrosity is evil. The makers of this thing worship Satan. Do they let people as stupid as these characters actually have drivers licenses (as they had in this)? I'd hate to think that I ever come even within twenty feet of scum like EACH of the characters, including the police.I know that some men work in the septic tank pumping business but at least they're paid to do that, and it's a useful service. Watching this slime serves no purpose, unless you've drunk some poison and need something to induce vomiting. Why did neither of Farrah's friends and house-mates believe Farrah or get mad at the rapist until Farrah tortured him back, in front of them, and then they believed his new version of the story, even though he'd only coughed up his confession with a knife to his throat? Oh, I already answered that one--because they're literally retarded.And why was the friend so hateful towards Farrah and believing of the rapist, earlier in the flick? Because her girlfriend's father had raped her but she, of course, couldn't do anything about it because there had, of course, been no witnesses so she had to always see her own rapist time & time again without being, of course, able to do anything about it. This is a horror flick, though not about the horror of rape and/or torture but rather the horror of people walking around who believe that this slime made sense.

A week later the attacker (James Russo) shows up at her home to finish the job but soon the woman turns the tables on him. That's a pretty simple set up for this psychological drama that comes off as a major disappointment. I had heard how terrific the original play was and how wonderful Fawcett was in it but this adaptation is a complete disaster that is poorly directed and features some questionable acting. I'll start with the direction which is just a complete horrid mess. There isn't a single thing in this movie that manages to have any emotion. None of the characters are believable and even worse is that we're never given anything to feel from start to finish. The opening attack sequence is meant to be full of suspense but it isn't. Fawcett's fear is meant to be dramatic but it isn't. The terror she's living in is meant to be dramatic but never is. Then when the cat and mouse game begins we're suppose to feel this psychological drama of the two characters going back and forth yet we never feel this. I've seen exploitation rape/revenge movies that have more emotion than this thing and that's pretty sad. I wouldn't place all the blame on the director because the cast has to take some of the heat for these horrid performances. Fawcett must have lost whatever she had in the play because she gives a one-note performance here and really comes off looking bad. Not once did I believe the shock her character was going through or anything else she was suppose to be portraying. Russo is just as bad as the rapist and Alfre Woodard and Diane Scarwid come off pretty poorly as well. This is all rather shocking because all four have proved that they can give good performance so why they're so incredibly bad here doesn't make any sense. The movie never really knows what it wants to do as it throws out so many mixed messages of rape, revenge and countless other items that are thrown out there only to slowly die off or be replaced by the next thought that the film tries to explain. A poor film all around and a real disappointment.

It considerably undermines what at times is a truly intense film. The other was the blatant exclusion of dialogue from the end of the play, conveniently omitting the play's best asset, which was its willingness to portray the rapist as a human being. Not one you'd let babysit your kids, probably not even one who should be allowed to live among others, but a human being none the less.Having read the play (I never saw it on stage), and liked it, my main reason for watching this film was to see James Russo in the kind of role he was born to play. In this I was not disappointed. Russo is an underrated actor whose uncanny ability to play hateful dirt-bags is usually wasted on supporting roles. Films in which he shines, such as Dangerous Game and No Way Home, are few and far between.I also was pleasantly surprised by Farah Fawcett, who turns in a flawless performance. Her cornered animal ferocity couldn't have been done better, nor could the inner conflict she expresses non-verbally at pivotal moments.The direction is at times, like certain inspired camera shots (I'm a sucker for snake-skin boots), quite complimentary to the story and acting, while at others, like the ones where the camera keeps cutting to the terrified faces of the roommates to show us things we already know as if we are sub-literate morons, utterly ridiculous. The whole opening sequence that establishes the character and her dilemma is unnecessary and plays like, again, a made-for-TV movie. If I watch this again, I'm fast-forwarding about twenty minutes and starting there.Once the real action begins, which is right in the thick of things, where the play begins, it's pretty much ceaseless in its intensity until the end. For me it even worked right up to the credits, it just really bugs me that you don't get to hear the guy sing, Found a peanut, found a peanut, and that it's not made clear enough that Farah isn't dragging him back to that fireplace because she wants to, it's because he wants her to. Now that he's told the truth and is playing fair, she doesn't hate him anymore. Maybe they could even be friends, seeing as they've now both experienced a power trip that polite folks haven't, one which I imagine triggers equal amounts of both self-loathing and exhilaration. That's the why that another poster alluded to, and that's the kind of message that could never make it into a movie with a score that belongs on network TV.Mastrosimone, who wrote both the play and the movie, damn well better have had a gun to his head, because the real rape victim here is his own play.
