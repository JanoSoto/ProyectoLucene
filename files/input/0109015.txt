It just so happens that he must go to Japan to present a dagger to the winner of a tornament. He had won that dagger when he was a lad, and he used it to accidentally scar his opponent, Koga's face.

All he needs now is the dagger, so he hires his nephew, Glam and his two bumbling friends, Slam and Vinnie to snatch the dagger.            Grandpa heads to the airport to buy his one ticket. Apparently, the boys decided to stay and play baseball that weekend. Their last game sort of backfired after Colt lost it on the pitcher. The boys saw the three stooges head for the cabin, and they gave them a workout that sent them running away fast. Pretty soon, Grandpa was off to Tokyo. He wasn't there one hour and he ended up in the hospital, due to a car driven by Slam, Glam and Vinnie plowed into his taxi. The boys learn of this and must help! So they fly to Tokyo.

Pretty soon he declares he has taught them all he knows and that they must now learn from a far greater teacher--in Japan. It just so happened that Grandpa had to go to Japan to present a dagger to a Ninja champion. He had received the dagger when he won the championship 50 years ago. It was against a brash youth named Koga. One time, Grandpa accidentally turned around suddenly with the dagger and scarred Koga's face. These past 50 years, Koga has been plotting revenge, and something else legend has it that a Samurai sword and the dagger will open a cave of gold. Koga stole the sword from a museum and now badly wanted the dagger; Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum play in their big Sunday baseball game against The Mustangs. Unfortunately due to Rocky's love sickness for Lisa DiMarino and Colt's bad temperment, the umpire suspends the game until next Sunday. Father Samuel was very disappointed in the boys and blamed Grandpa's Ninja training.           Koga enlists his dim-witted nephew Glam and his bumbling pals Slam and Vinnie to steal the dagger so when Grandpa goes to pick up his one airline ticket (the boys decided to stay and play in the game) the brain dead trio attempt to break into the cabin. Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum suit up and give them quite a work out. Slam and Vinnie attempt to escape, but their truck refused to cooperate. Finally it started, Colt and Rocky cleverly tied a rope to Glam's leg and the other to the truck so they dragged him off with them. Well the next day Grandpa heads for Tokyo and he isn't there one hour when suddenly Slam, Glam and Vinnie rear end his taxi cab, giving him whiplash. Back home, the boys hear of Grandpa's hospitalization and race to Japan. They are told to present the dagger at the tournament. They meet the champion a girl! Her name is Miyo. She agrees to teach the boys Ninja when they agree to help her improve her baseball. She says she has trouble swinging her butt. Koga sends Slam, Glam and Vinnie to the hospital to get Grandpa. They dress as nurses but are soon left at the mercy of a real and deadly nurse Nurse Hino. Grandpa escapes but is then captured by Koga's men. They also kidnap Rocky, Colt, Tum Tum and Miyo. But with their keen wit, and a little Ninjanuity, they make their escape and follow Koga, Grandpa and the Ninja cronies to Castle Hikona and the cave of gold.          The sword and the dagger open the door to an old Samurai grave yard and a cave of gold! Rocky, Colt, Tum Tum and Miyo give Koga's men quite a work out and they escape with Koga, whom after this whole experience, has been reformed. The gang goes home and makes it in time to play in the big baseball game and this time, they keep their wits about them and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and win the game! Pitcher Darren wanted to pick a fight with them, but Miyo gives him a lesson in temprement he'll never forget.         I think this movie was just as good as the original. Max Elliot Slade returns as Colt. Sean Fox takes over the role of Rocky and J. Evan Bonifant is Tum Tum. Victor Wong is back as Grandpa and unfortunately we lost Wong in 2001. There was another 3 Ninjas movie called 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up which I think was really meant to be part 2. Because it stars the same kids as Part 1 and they look about the same age. So it is unknown why that movie wasn't released until after this one. As you remember, in Part 1 there was an evil villain from Grandpa's past and he sends a trio of bumbling thieves out to get them. Same token here. So for all you 3 Ninjas fans, I recommend 3 Ninjas Kick Back! Four strands of rope Mind, body, spirit and heart!

Unknown to the brothers, there is a mystery behind the dagger and an old competitor, is after it for the dagger holds the key to the secret behind an ancient treasure chamber...Most of the original cast members return for the second film installment. Except for the roles of Rocky (Sean Fox) and Tumtum (Evan Bonifant),they were played by different actors this time around. The change took a while to set in since I was still used to seeing the former actors who portrayed the respective roles from the first film. Reprising the role of Colt is Max Elliot Slade.One of the issues seen on the film was letting the kids find themselves. That was interesting to watch since it gave more depth on the kids' parents and their wishes for their sons.Watching this next film gave a little wider field for the brothers. We see them now preoccupied with baseball and Colt's apparent difficulties in throwing the shuriken. But with practice and confidence he can apply what he has learned (in ninja training)in baseball as well. I loved it when they made home run. Max somersaulting to the home base was a nice touch. Fantastic! The brothers also met Miyo (Caroline Junko King) the winner of the ninja competition where she refined the brothers' ninja skills during their brief stay in Japan and at the same time they, in turn help her with her baseball catching technique having failed to enter in the previous tryouts.All in all, Colt controls his anger while Miyo perfects in catching the ball at the baseball match and the brothers' team wins.
