[{"Title":"Much better than its reputation has it, but no gem","Date":"4 March 2005","Score":"109 out of 119 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" A deep space ambulance ship receives a distress call from a mining outpost on a rogue moon (it's been removed from its orbit) 3 thousand light years away. Normally, that wouldn't be so unusual, but the distress signal was specifically hailing this particular ship (like calling someone inside an ambulance directly instead of dialing 911) and when the source is revealed, female crew member Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett) realizes that she knows the person who sent it. Worse, it's someone whom she's had an extensive personal history with and whom she considers a walking nightmare. Before she can warn Captain A.J. Marley (Robert Forster), they're in hyper drive on their way to the moon and unwittingly headed into trouble.This film was plagued with problems--the originally attached director, Geoffrey Wright, quit. The replacement director, Walter Hill, had creative differences with the studio, which demanded re-shoots and new cuts from none other than Francis Ford Coppola and Jack Sholder. Hill ended up requesting that his name be removed, and used the new version of the infamous Alan Smithee designation--Thomas Lee.And that wasn't the end of it. Upon its release, Supernova received a critical drubbing. Rotten Tomatoes, for example, a website that collates professional and semi-professional reviews on films, showed a 90% negative reading on Supernova. The reaction from everyday viewers mirrored this reception, with mostly negative comments right here on IMDb.But Supernova isn't that bad of a film. It's no gem, but it does a lot of things right The premise is certainly stimulating. The transition from a stock, Alien (1979)-like sci-fi film to a thriller in space is well done. The characters are interesting. The suspense level gradually increases until the very end of the film.There are thoughtful subtexts about giving oneself over to a feel-good substance, survival of the fittest evolution, and cyclical regeneration. The fountain of youth device is intriguing, and even though the Ninth Dimension stuff is gobbledy-gook, it's good gobbledy-gook--it makes some sense as fantasy material, and it provides a lot of suspense. There is a subtle social commentary/criticism on attitudes about violence in the media, population problems and eugenics.A lot of the cast is also good--I like Robert Forster a lot, although unfortunately he disappears from the picture too soon. I'm also a fan of Lou Diamond Phillips, even if his presence more often than not signifies a C, D or lower film. James Spader's characterization of Nick Vanzant is nice and complex. And the rest of the cast is at least decent, even if Peter Facinelli overacts a bit towards the end--but the role calls for that.However, as a 7, Supernova has its share of problems, too. I don't usually subtract points for a film being clich√©d, but it's difficult not to do so in this case. The beginning of the film is right out of Alien--with the ship waking up a crew member unexpectedly, after running some tests. This is saved a bit by funny dialogue at the end of the scene. The computer, Sweetie, is reminiscent at times of Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968). The holographic chess game is right out of Star Wars (1977). The distress signal scenario is again out of Alien, and the exploration of the abandoned mine on the rogue moon is similar to Aliens (1986).The dialogue in the opening of the film is also a bit too jargonistic and quickly delivered for its own good. It can be difficult to get the gist of it without subtitles. There are a number of editing problems, most prominently during the near miss of the out of control ship with the moon--shaky cam cinematography doesn't help, either. And for so many directors being involved, the direction, while not incompetent, comes across as primarily flat.Is Supernova worth seeing? If you're a huge sci-fi fan (meaning that you watch and like most sci-fi films) and you do not mind familiar material that's slightly clunky at times, yes. There are enough positives to make it worthwhile. Like usual with 7s, the film is best approached with lowered expectations. Given the reputation of this film, that should be no problem.

The technological picture is well developed strikingly original and interestingly conveyed.  Many underlying themes of what happens to humans in the presence of all kinds of environments (psychological, sociological, spatial and otherwise) are touched upon.  It is not a mindless drivel action movie which is probably (I know I'm not being very nice...) why so many people really didn't like it.  Aside from the ending which was rather humorous and may have left some with a groan, I happened to like it though it was a tad cheesy.  This movie really touched on so many things in so many ways that it deserves a much better rating than what it got.  The mood conveyed was dark and very horiffic.  I would say in a more psychological way than a gut spilling sort of way.  The performances of the actors in this film shine, perhaps with the exception of Lou Diamond Phillips, though not to his detriment as he is capable of better work, and his part was really rather small.  Tight shots on the crew contrary to earlier comment, really conveyed the emotion of each situation as well as the compressed environment of the ship rather than hiding all of the technological wonders in the set.  Sweeties voice being criticized is a non-issue in my opinion, female voices are supposed to (supported by scientific study) command attention better than male-sounding ones.  In no way did Sweetie come across as a phone sex operator to me.  Quite to the contrary, I submit the scene in which she begs for the additional passphrase from Benjamin in order to be able to save his life.  This was one of the most touching scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  Between a computer and her Sys Admin there develops love of a kind, really.  Marvelous.  On par with Event Horizon though somewhat lesser than it for the psychological horiffics, but really different movies with different objectives.All you people trashing this... Go watch a heartwarming coming of age movie and waste no more of your time trashing this fine piece of work.

MGM had their minds on a 'sexy and hip' type movie while director Walter Hill was making a dark, 'logical' sci-fi movie. After the studio screwed with his movie, he took off. The movie was then taken charge by such directors as Francis Ford Coppola, and Jack Sholder (The Hidden). Well to make a long story short, MGM directed this movie, not as they say in the credits, 'Thomas Lee'. The movie ended up being about an entire crew doing nothing but screwing each other (literally), while bad stuff happens around them. That's it.I highly recommend everybody who has seen this movie to check out the DVD. There they can see all the deleted scenes that the studio cut out. Check them out, then you think about it. Would you like to have seen the type of movie portrayed in the deleted scenes, or in the current turd that was released to the entire world? IMHO, I'd like to see the movie in the deleted scenes.

Not recommended for others","Date":"17 July 2005","Score":"30 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Supernova is legendary for is production problems and poor critical reception. However, the end result is an entertaining action sci-fi film which fails to live down to its absurdly low expectations and also fails to live up to its very high potential. in other words, it's better than most people say, and nowhere near as good as it should have been.A rescue ship manned by several paramedics, a hot shot pilot just out of a drug rehab, and emergency personnel, patrols the frontier of human exploration, serving mining colonies, etc, far from earth's solar system. Just as we are learning the personalities in the film, and just as they are starting to become interesting, a distress call is picked up and the ship responds. Enigmatically, the distress call seems to have come from somebody out of the chief medical officer's (Angela Bassett) past, with a lot of problems. The patient, however, is just the beginning of the mystery, as a strange object with the potential power to destroy the known universe is eventually found.The first problem with the film is that it bites off much more than it can chew - developing compelling characters, a very interesting, detailed and original plot, excellent special effects and some great sets, but never permitting any of them to grow, expand or become fully realized. The second problem is, I suspect, the fault of studio mismanagement. Rather than contributing to the film, the cinematography and editing are so poor that they, in fact, distract and detract. The production problems - switching directors, mismanagement by the sponsoring studio, inartistic and uninspired re-shooting and re-editing - suggest a couple of simple explanations. There are so many wipes and fades in the second half of the film that I began to wonder whether they were supposed to signify something (such as the passage of time, switching of dimensions, etc) which the audience was not privy to.Contrary to popular belief, this film had a great deal of potential, however, it would have made a much better TV mini-series or even a premise for a TV series than a cinema release. Why? Because the story and especially the characters needed a lot more time and a lot less editing to develop properly.The story line can be seen as totally inept or quite brilliant. Though I am no fan of black-box pseudoscience explanations such as 9th dimensional matter, I prefer the 'quite brilliant' interpretation. If you think a lot about what goes on in this film, you can easily link together what seems to be a mess of loose ends and detached subplots and really 'get' what the story is meant to convey. Facinelli's character can be seen as a guardian or simply a power-addict; Spader's former drug addiction can make his attempt at heroism seem a resolution of his inner demons; his relationship with Bassett can be seen as the resolution of the entire set of problems the film poses. However, realizing all of this requires more though and energy than the film itself suggests, and depicting it so that it could have been easily deciphered by the audience would have required at least a few more hours than the film was allowed.The acting is actually quite good. Angela Bassett is, as usual, excellent, and Peter Facinelli and Wilson Cruz are both worth watching. James Spader's often maligned performance is perfect for the character he is playing - a former drug addict on a quest for redemption. I generally do not like Spader's work very much (there are already too many Clint Eastwood and Robert Downey types in the acting world today), but I do respect his talent. It is unfortunate that the characters were not permitted to develop as they should have, and though the reasons why are almost certainly the lack of decisive directorial control and the studio's post-production mistreatment of the film, this does not excuse Walter Hill from partial responsibility. Hill, after all, used some of the same signature structural plot devices in the over-rated Aliens and the weak but under-rated Alien3 - both of which were better films. the problem with the direction here is, predictably, simply one of consistency. Two to three directors and who knows how many editing and post-production teams simply can not make a perfectly coherent artistic vision.Simply put, if you're into Sci-Fi, and don't mind films which favor the fi part of the phrase over the sci, then you might just find yourself quite entertained. If you're no a sci-fi fan and you like action films, you might make it through Supernova. But, if you're not a sci-fi fan and your looking for something important, artistic and thoughtful, you should avoid this film like the plague.

This man isn't what he seems to be and he might danger the entire crew from getting home.Directed by Thomas Lee, which is actually action filmmaker Walter Hill (48 Hrs, Last Man Standing, Trespass) made an interesting if failed science-fiction thriller that has an intriguing premise. Production Designs and Terrific Special Effects are the highlights of this odd sci-fi tale. The cast do their best with this wildly uneven material. There was so much problems making this picture that director Hill disowned the film after MGM edited their version. When the studio had problems, they hired B-Movie Filmmaker Jack Sholder (A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2Freddy's Revenge, Alone in the Dark, The Hidden) do to the re-shoots and then three-time Oscar-WinnerFrancis Ford Coppola (The Godfather Trilogy, Apocalyspe Now, Garden of Stones) edited an version for the studio but nothing worked.

The premise is a medical rescue ship that apparently has only one doctor on it (Bassett) who just happens to be a super computer and space dimensional scientist too. You find this out later when Bassett is talking 9th dimensional Star Trek mumbo jumbo with the computer Sweetie. Spader is out of his element here. He does freaky movies well, but this is run of the mill star trekkin complete with scientific gobbledygook which he is unaccustomed to spewing. The plot is simple, murderous weirdo with a bomb in space. Done about 1000 times before, but now done 1001 times....in blue! Yes EVERYTHING is blue. We get it already, its a blue giant! I don't think I saw any other color other than a flash of red on a control panel and some purple in that 9th dimensional alien suppository. I didn't understand why that guy got into a busted pod and ended up inside out, I didn't understand why the so-called rescue ship people are so incompetent they nearly kill themselves trying to rescue others because they don't know how to calculate a jump, and I don't know why Lou Diamond Phillips is in it.

She plays the same sexually frustrated angry black woman she always plays. Just have sex with hunky Spader already and relax a bit.

At least Battlefield Earth provided a barrage of unintentional laughs.  Supernova features hackneyed writing, mostly uninspired acting, as well as choppy and mishandled direction, all at the hands of Mr. Thomas Lee (AKA Walter Hill), which now seems to be the new choice of pseudonyms for directors ashamed of their work.Supernova begins in a strange enough manner.  There's an opening shot of outer space without the usual opening credits or title sequence.  We are introduced to the Nightengale, a search and rescue medical vessel led by Captain A.J. Marley (Robert Forster).  The rest of the crew are co-pilot Nick Vanzant (James Spader), medical technician Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), and three other crew members who are obviously easily dispensable.The ship receives an S.O.S. signal coming from an abandoned mine.Through a method of travel known as the interdimensional jump, the crew arrives at this abandoned mine, and they pick up a stranger named Karl Larson (Peter Facinelli).  X-rays show he has some sort of strange bone growth, which could be due to contact he had with an extraterrestrial object he brought along.  According to the computers, the object (which is pink and resembles a giant glowing egg) is capable of destroying all matter and creating new life as well.Larson eventually reveals his true colors and begins to eliminate the crew one-by-one, as well as stranding Nick on the mine.  It becomes a game of cat-and-mouse as Nick and Kaela do battle with Larson, whose contact with the alien artifact has now made him seemingly invincible.You might notice I didn't mention anything about a supernova.  Well, that's because nothing of the sort comes into fruition until the last 5 minutes, and even then it's only a minor plot device used to generate some false tension.  As for the rest of the movie, does this thriller ever generate any suspense?  Nada.  There are a couple of cheap thrills at the end, but this is hardly the tense and scary film I'm sure director Hill had in mind.From the stories I've read, Hill's version was butchered, cut by over a half-hour because MGM preferred a sexy space adventure over his idea of a sci-fi thriller.  Well, I'm not exactly sure what MGM had in mind, but Supernova is far from sexy, featuring several scenes of bare breasts (mostly Robin Tunney's) and a couple of zero-g sex scenes that are painful to watch. Heck, you'll get far, far more outer space sexual titillation (cheap as it still is) from the straight-to-video movie Alien Files.What the end result of all the studio cuts is a film that I still don't believe would have had a chance for critical and commercial success even if all the cut material was inserted back.  Of the 91 or so minutes I viewed I can't possibly see an extra 30 minutes improving it by a whole lot.  The version I saw was the R-rated video release that only adds in a few more scenes of bare breasts.  Trust me, you wouldn't be missing much if you saw this movie in theaters.  I'm surprised the studio didn't just end the whole production when things began to go all wrong.How did it all go wrong?  Let me begin with the direction.  Walter Hill must have felt obligated to direct in Blair Witch fashion, because a good portion of the movie is shot with shaky camera movements.  This is acceptable during the action scenes, but he even does this during normal conversations.  Simultaneously, he also shoots much of the film in a tilted angle, similar to what we saw in Battlefield Earth.  The combination of these two elements serve only to create headaches.The script is also to blame.  Written by William Malone and Daniel Chuba, Supernova doesn't make a very interesting small-scale film.  The idea of an extraterrestrial object capable of destroying the solar system is more fitting for a larger scale film, but the writers seemed to be satisfied placing it within a story that is Alien-lite.  The plot holes are also apparent.  Think about this, there's a six person crew aboard the Nightengale and they have six chambers for the interdimensional jump.  They're a rescue vessel; exactly how do they bring back survivors?  They certainly don't share the chambers (as explained in the film, since they have to get nude to go inside and there's the possibility genetic material could be fused together).  There's a moment when a Nick mentions that only five of the six chambers work, but the computer later states that there are seven total chambers.  Hmm, seems like even the writers can't count.There are three decent performances.  James Spader, looking and sounding a lot like Jeff Goldblum, is pretty good as the buff hero.  Angela Bassett exerts the most energy and seems to look involved.  Robert Forster is also decent in the scenes he appears in.  Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, and Wilson Cruz are mostly forgettable.  Phillips is there to go crazy (a la Sam Neill in Event Horizon though not to nearly as memorable an effect), Tunney is just eye candy since all she does is bare her breasts, and Cruz definitely shows that the Star Trek expendable crew member syndrome is very much still alive and kicking.  This guy pretty much has dead man tatooed on his forehead the moment we see him.  Peter Facinelli is easily the worst.  Part of how effective the movie is requires we be scared of him. Not only is his acting bad, but he looks like a cross between Tom Cruise, Chris O'Donnell, and Matthew McConnaughey.  Tell me, is that scary? (Perhaps, but certainly not in the manner the film makers intended)The visuals don't add up to a lot, either.  Though the outer space shots are pretty-looking, the spaceship design is far too obvious a special effect and everything else inside the ship is fairly standard looking.  There aren't any particularly memorable effects in this film.  Even the explosion at the end doesn't create much visual spectacle.All these problems could be somewhat forgiveable if Hill could have only injected some tension and adrenaline into the proceedings.  For a movie that aims to thrill the audience, it's a dull festival.  The pace drags and all attemtps to create excitement fall flat.  A few weeks after this film's release, Pitch Black arrived in theaters, which is everything this movie is not thrilling, well-acted and directed, and some amazing visuals with a script that knows how to twist the plot into something unpredictable.

When I sat down to write a review of this I was thinking I would give it two stars. But then I started thinking - and I realized that I didn't have a single good thing to say about it.Such as it is, the story is about a sort of medical spaceship named the Nightingale set some time in the future (if the time period was mentioned I missed it.) After the Nightingale receives a mysterious distress signal from over 3000 light years away, the ship's captain (played by Robert Forster) decides to respond. They have to go through something called a dimension jump (a way of travelling from one place in the universe to another very quickly) and discover the sender of the message, who has a strange artifact he wants to take back to earth in order to get rich quick.Painfully boring. Yes. The leads in this are James Spader and Angela Bassett. Both are decent enough actors, but neither could save this, and even their performances were far from their best. It was handy that in order to go through a dimension jump everybody has to strip naked. To give credit to those responsible for this, aside from a clear topless shot of Danika (Robin Tunney) and some blurry naked shots of Dr. Evers (Bassett - or, more likely, her double) this aspect of the story wasn't exploited. The ship has a rather strange robot dressed as a World War I fighter pilot because the captain is a history buff and a talking computer with a personality - sort of like HAL from 2001 except that this one is a female named Sweetie (please) and it's fallen in love with crewman Benj (Wilson Cruz.)

Meanwhile, it grants super powers to the survivor, who proceeds to go into Jason Vorhees mode and kill the rest of the crew.Now, if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, you can see that the writer/director had a very different film in mind. Probably a director's cut would make a little more sense, but not much. It has a lot of science fiction conventions (like the life tubes and a huge ship with a small crew) that make little or no sense. It also contains clich√©s like a malfunctioning android and a computer with a quirky personality, which are more annoying than helpful. The worst, of course, is the acting. One can only conclude that the actors realized fairly early on that this was going to be crap, and started phoning it in. Bassett is the worst of the lot, and I've seen her put in better performances in much cheaper movies.Even the trailer is instructive, as it tried to almost portray the movie as a light comedy which it clearly wasn't, scoring it with music that didn't belong in the film...Perhaps when they do the director's cut, they will explain how bad they screwed it up...

The whole idea is that the characters are on a rescue mission, to see if there are any survivors on a remote base. Their ship travels through space using a form of warp drive which is potentially damaging to them, so they must each enter a protective cocoon, similar to suspended animation. It is noted there are exactly the same number of cocoons as there are crew members. One character is horribly killed when a cocoon chamber is damaged, and said character is exposed to the warp effect during the trip. When a lone survivor is found at the base, this creates an opportunity - with one crew member deceased, the now-repaired chamber can be used to bring back the survivor. Here's my problem - how did they INTEND to bring back a survivor, much less a group of survivors??!!! They had no extra chambers to bring anyone back!!! They weren't equipped to rescue anyone!!!

When you've got all those these happening as they are in Supernova, you know Thanksgiving is coming early.The film is a lot like a Doctor Who episode and I kept hoping Tom Baker and a companion would drop in with the TARDIS and straighten everything out. The film did need it.A medical rescue vessel, a futuristic space ambulance if you will gets a distress call from a mining planet lots of light years away from Earth. Off into hyper drive they go and when there they meet a rather strange young man played by Peter Facinelli who's got a strange kind of element he's found and wanting to take it back to Earth.He's determined to get it there and when James Spader the captain says no, Facinelli starts killing everyone around him. That element is making him both younger and stronger so those that remain have a fight on their hands.I happen to meet cast member Wilson Cruz at a conference about seven years ago and he said while he was not exactly thrilled with the final product in Supernova, he said the film was memorable to him because he became the first Latino in space. And the first openly gay man at the same time. He does have the best dialog in the film with a supercomputer along the lines of 2001, A Space Odyssey's HAL.

I also find that, after one finds out they have 17 hours to fix something or they die, having sex in zero g, while that may be enjoyable, doesn't really solve things. So these are small potatoes, I realize that. But what really puts this movie into my list of Possible Reasons to Go On Murderous Rampage is that nothing that goes on in the movie seems to resonate with the entire crew. This I chalk up to Walter Hill saying adi√≥s due to creative differences, leaving the studio execs and outside help (Coppola apparently has nothing to do on a Saturday than edit something he has absolutely no interest in doing) to try and piece together something that probably looked really cool written down. The end result is a bunch of really good actors who look bad in space. Not to mention, it's the really bad kind of space.If you haven't seen the movie, SURPRISE there's a supernova in it! Well, it's a bit surprising to me, because they mention it, something about a degrading orbit, +17 hours till everyone is incinerated, yada yada, and that's about it. Not joking, that's the attitude everyone has towards this but Lou Diamond Phillips, who decides he'd rather go hang out with the weird alien 9th dimensional yadayada. Robin Tunney can't stop thinking about sex, so she's kind of turned on by the new guy (Peter Facinelli), till he kills her. There's this other problem where James Spader is sabotaged by the New Guy. Turns out the New Guy is the Old Guy, Karl Larsen, the one they thought they were coming for in the first place. So New Guy kills everyone except for Angela Bassett, who he tries to convince this 9th dimensional stuff is the bee's knees. He's forgotten one thing, though, and that is the inevitability of a Plot Hole re-materializing as Deus Ex Machina; James Spader found a rescue shuttle (how New Guy doesn't see this coming, who knows) and the two battle. Well, not really battle. Spader gets tossed around a bunch, Spader lops New Guy's hand off, Spader tries to lock up New Guy, New Guy escapes, rejoins his hand (makes sense, right? 9th dimensional schtuff is better than super-glue) and then dies because he's an idiot. Spader and Bassett leave the galaxy by a space-hair and accidentally melded part of their DNA code, giving Bassett a baby and Happy the end. There, I saved you a lot of time. I made a mistake in not following general consensus on this one being really bad, and now I've told you how ridiculous this movie is. Gosh, I almost forgot to mention, ROBERT FORSTER's in this movie! Well, he knew it was gonna be a bust, so he gets out of the movie before things go to pot. I've heard a lot of people say this movie isn't that bad, but that's I suppose in comparison to night terrors and muggings. No, this is not the worst movie in the world, but does that mean it should be excused? Why should you see it, when you can watch something as bad as AVP and be 10 more times as entertained than watching Supernova. Supernova is a film that had been given up on by its makers, by people who wanted to do right, but inevitably gave it the Hudson reply of That's it man. Game Over, man. Game Over.

But, strangely when I saw the entire movie for once, late a night, I discovered myself immersed in a scary, haunting outer space, sci-fi movie that avoided the usual stereotypical traps and attempted to play it straight, somewhat like Alien (1979) though not with as much perfection and authenticity. I really enjoyed the twist towards the end which I had forgotten about and the fact that a number of a characters will dispatched without much fanfare, much for typical for the character involved than in most movies, making the movie all that more riveting. The beginning sequence of brief get to know scenes of the various character were way underdeveloped, though whether or not a more developed beginning of the movie may not have really contributed much more to the movie. The beginning was both ordinary and intriguing. The storyline, somewhat like The Sphere (1998) in outer space, was decent enough and James Spader actually did a remarkable job with his character. He avoided the general likable character with charisma and popular appeal and actually played one of the most straightest of characters in recent memory, though some would consider his character boring and flat. Some of the scenes that might be considered derivative were just that, but really didn't detract from the movie as much as contributed to the overall eerie sense of foreboding. One of the more memorable scenes was the 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) Hal 2000 moment but with a particular emotional twist. What made this movie a decent and above average thriller was a decent script and plot along with characters that were acceptably remarkable in themselves, a suggestion of emotional connections and intimacy without overdramatization. This was a straight-forward no spectacular over the top attempt at just haunting and ominous story telling along with some unexpected dramatic moments that defied traditional convention. 8/10.

Even one character that doesn't have sex (benjamin) is in love with the ship's computer. It's all very sad, really. And it kind of works for the movie.

Marley (Robert Forster) an experienced individual who despite his obvious credentials in many films does not remain long in the movie. His Co-Pilot is brash and cocky, Nick Vanzant (James Spader) who constantly and dramatically spars with Dr. Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett). Lou Diamond Phillips is surprising as Yerzy Penalosa a medical technician who is so curious, would risk himself to touch the edges of eternity. The story centers on a strange and desperate call from Moon Miners the Far side of the Galaxy requesting emergency assistance. The Nightingale responds immediately only to discover they have damaged their ship, failed to find the Miners and have instead taken aboard Karl Larson, (Peter Facinelli) a lone survivor who fails to inform his rescuers, he has found a 'Dooms-day device. The power of the Alien device is to replace the existing galaxy with one from the Ninth Dimension. As the crew begins to fall prey to Larson's devious destructive measures, Vanzant seeks to find answers. The special visual effects in the film are incredible as are the interactive action sequences between the space crew and their passenger. The brief nude scenes are tidy at best and do not hamper the plot. Indeed, the final transporter scene is straight out of the novel and leaves one speculating as to 'Einstein's possibilities of two objects occupying the same space.

Although the story line is good and interesting the direction in which the story develops betrays a paranoid and fearful view (of the makers) on what the future might bring. The first thing that strikes is that the producers/writers find it so frightening that machines could take over and gain power that they gave the main computer a willingness to have emotions and to fall in love with one of the crewmembers! Eventually it is a film in which the computers and machines show more emotions (and are willing to do so) than the crewmembers who appear to be as cold as ice, and very computing. The men and women aboard all seem to be paranoid and seeing bugbears when they stumble on a bounty hunter who shows admirable generosity and love. The hunter also appears to be very wise. Still the director of this movie draws him out as the villain that should be stopped and put in jail. The crewmembers who act constantly out of anxiety on the other hand are at the good side. The most cold and fearful among them will eventually survive and return safely to their home. The villain (just a regular guy that has found something of tremendous positive value) who comes in peace and immediately offers to share his treasure is abruptly rejected and violently robbed of his bounty.Besides the makers of this science fiction film were paradoxically very afraid of what new science is bringing. In the beginning we see a couple, standing on the good side, wishing to have a baby and starting a procedure to get permission from the government. One of them then says Don¬¥t worry baby. We are people who are not genetically modified, so undoubtly we will get permission to beget a child.The makers of this film were obviously troubled by their own mental bugbears.

His name is Troy Larson (There are some family history between him and the doctor on the ship, But I'm not gonna tell you that stuff. Its actually not intressting.) In Troy's emergency ship he used to get to the nightengale they find a mysterious artifact. An alien artifact. Something from another world. Grr! And you can probably imagine where it goes from here.

This movie was almost universally reviled by critics and audiences alike, one can read the reviews here on imdb and walk away scared to death of the movie.

Thus, now the crew must fight for survival. Many sci-fi cliches find their way into the mix (talking HAL-like computer,etc...) but it still manages to come off exciting and somewhat fresh in my opinion. The production is slick and all the sets are very well designed and realistic looking. Special effects are truly top notch. The premise/plot is interesting enough to move the action along despite some Hollywood standard love subplot cheesiness (the contribution of Coppola, I understand). Plenty of nudity (the very beautiful Robin Tunney!) and some cool gore. Basically B Horror fun with A movie special effects. A decent sci-fi horror flick ...but probably for fans of the genre only.

I shall not explain the film as this will spoil the whole thing... Well the film is set within space in about 150 years time if my memory serves me right and Nick played by James Spader is a new arrival on the ship. Now there are some very good twists and plenty of them in this film, although if you are incredibly awake you can spot them just before they are reveiled so its also a challenging film to watch if you like brain testers... There are Action parts within the film and if you watch the deleted scenes it adds a whole new level of twists and potential twists for you to work out which could change your perception on the film. Now the back of the box makes the film sound outstanding and the Trailer makes you think that its probably going to be okay and maybe aims your view about the type of genre towards 'Family Viewing'.  Now this be not the case, well in my opinion anyway... The film is done very well including all of the Graphics done by the team who did the Titanic and there are also parts of comedy that turn up throughout the film between Sweetie (the ship computer) and Nick (James Spader) which are quite good as it adds in a level of humour, but the humour does know its limits and so there isn't that much in the film which probably makes these parts a great bonus for the film. Now there are other twists which don't happen but you feel that they could easily do so if a few circumstances change... Now the DVD on Region 2 has a trailer, a 2 page booklet explaining about the Production of the film and around 30mins of deleted and Alternative Scenes...

I was curious to find out what was wrong with this movie, when i read about its reputation, and as i love sci-fi i decided to buy the dvd, specialy after reading all the bad comments around here. As many  people compared Supernova to Event Horizon, i was sure i was going to love it, because i still think Event Horizon ranks among the top best sci-fi movies of the last two decades despite its plot-influences.Well, Supernova trully disapointed me, but that doesn¬¥t mean that i think it¬¥s as bad as many claim. Actualy i think it is an excelent sci-fi B-Movie.Altough it costed a fortune it still looks like it was filmed by Roger Corman, and that was what appealed to me despite everything.And as i wasn¬¥t expecting anything spectacular to begin with, i didn¬¥t got disapointed.Actualy the only thing that disapointed me was that Supernova is not even half as good as Event Horizon despite having everything to be a good adult sci-fi movie. By watching the deleted scenes on the dvd, i can¬¥t help to feel that somewhere there was a brilliant idea here for a sci-fi, but someone decided to throw it all through a window and i can bet it wasn¬¥t its creators but some Hollywood executive who did the damage.It¬¥s sad to see how the good ideas that the movie still shows glimpses of, were wasted and replaced by action scenes and happy endings, leaving nothing of the great disturbing feeling that it was set to build up in the scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the movie. This is realy hard to describe, specialy to the people who only saw the theatrical version, but the original initial (deleted) scene with the captain¬¥s introduction realy show us how special this story was being set up to be, and it must be one of the most simple and beautifuly shot introductions for a sci-fi movie ever. As the original ending must be one of the most disturbing and original endings ever filmed. Just for these concepts this (dvd) movie is a must see for everyone who trully loves science-fiction. If you can take the pain of watching a good sci-fi movie being totaly trashed through out 80 minutes of its duration, you¬¥ll love the wasted ideas and concepts present in Supernova. But this is just for sci-fi fans only, not for the general audiences who made Matrix a sucess.Speaking about Matrix, if you get the Supernova dvd, don¬¥t miss its theatrical trailler, for it¬¥s trully a work of Art, and totaly gives the idea that Supernova is going to be something like a cross between Matrix, Scream, Terminator and 2001. It even has a contemporany Pop/Rock soundtrack as a music background in it ! (What ?!!!!) This must be the most misleading trailler i ever saw in my entire life, and so no wonder how so many people trash this movie. Everybody who went to see Supernova because of the trailler was totaly fooled ! This is not another cool sci-fi teen-movie. But it¬¥s a brilliant trailler, and an hilarious one also, for we can see that somewhere in Hollywood someone was desperate to turn Supernova into another Matrix and i¬¥m sure that was what totaly destroyed Supernova as the inovating sci-fi movie it could have been.So, good points...the special effects are very good, particulary the hyper-jump wich is the most spectacular i ever saw. The production design is fantastic altough a bit limited in variety, but it has a brilliant retro 50¬¥s style mixed with modern sci-fy concepts wich gives unique visuals to this movie. Good actors who can do wonders with their characters despite the awfull limitations the (filmed) script has, except maybe for the Tom Cruise clone. The relation between the ship¬¥s computer and a human wich could have been fantasticaly developed but it was not. The soundtrack is excelent and atmospheric. And the photography and edditing save the movie from being a total waste. On dvd, the original begining and ending wich are excelent sci-fi moments.Bad points...the idiotic and predictable good-guys run from bad dude terminator style plot. The total lack of suspance. The total lack of horror or chilling moments wich could have done wonders for this movie. Boring action. And finaly but not least the Tom Cruise clone ! Maybe this is a good point, because as impersonations go, the bad guy impersonation of Tom Cruise is the most impressive one i ever saw. There are times we forgget we are actualy not looking at Tom Cruise but at another actor instead. What was the idea here ?...A Bowfinger style concept ?! Did someone fooled Cruise into this movie without him knowing about ?...Anyway, don¬¥t trash this movie, because it¬¥s not that bad. It¬¥s just it could have been brilliant instead. I hope someone decides to grab some of the concepts present here and make a realy good movie with them because the potential is there, just loose the T2 Tom Cruise next time please...7 out of 10 despite everything it¬¥s a miracle that this is a very watchable film. There are much worse (sucessful) things you can see out there, so have fun with Supernova and stop complaining. Just don¬¥t be fooled by the trailler and you¬¥ll have fun.

As I said You have to pay attention.Short plot description A rescue ship coming to help a person; this person (Karl Larson) is trying to bring a 9-dimensional bomb(!) back to earth while thinking he brings a great artifact back home... But its purpose is to extinguish any race that is intelligent enough to fly into deep space and find it and bring it back home! The artifact/bomb makes him almost indestructible and ARROGANT. Having found out about the bomb, all crew members try to stop Karl Larson, but most of them die.Karl is a person you really love to hate - even when he's still playing the handsome guy. Great acting. The other characters are well drawn as being well trained members of a rescue crew despite having their little problems that you can identify with. And these characters are well acted, too.The rest is good special effects, a quiet, calm way of introducing the characters (YES it does remind everyone of Kubrick's 2001 and it's good to see storytelling like that again), the action is Alien-like but - NO MONSTER! Just a superstrong human that does what he likes and this is the frightening part Somebody able and willing to do what he likes...You might think this sounds like not being interesting at all, but it might be because I'm not as good at writing comments, than at actually understanding and discussing movies with other people in real life.

To which the 'film noir' lighting greatly assists this cinematic work to achieve a hard edged realistic feel.  Added to all of this, the direction is even throughout, which in itself is remarkable considering there was a change of directors near the end of filming and subsequent editing.  This should have been a great film. So what is the problem?Well for one, the story is okay, if unremarkable.  But the primary error is that the key dialogue required by the viewing audience to decipher the alien mystery is so quickly mumbled   ( a la Clint Eastwood style) by the film's lead female co-star, Angela Bassett, that it is, virtually, unintelligible. This oversight is incredible in a sixty four million dollar film whose dialogue throughout, on the whole, is so crisp and delightfully articulate.  Yet only Ms. Bassett's defining statement after said blurb is clearly heard  These beings, whoever they are, are as smart as God and not as nice.  Impressive and quite memorable but, unfortunately, not enough.Despite this annoying critical flaw, the film itself is quite enthralling cinematicly and well worth, if not the theater, at least the rental.

So tons of reshoots and re-editing was done to try to make the movie into something that it wasn't. Most of the extreme and cool alien f/x seen in the trailer was left on the cutting room floor and this is what we ended up with.

Get the DVD anyway.The online film critic, James Berardinelli, identified three factors that are a sure sign of trouble for a studio release 1. It is released in January, AFTER the holiday movie season.2. It is not pre-screened for critics.  3. The director lost control of the project, and asked to have his name removed from the credits. (This used to result in the official pseudonym Alan Smithee. The new pseudonym is Thomas Lee). Supernova was marked by all three disaster conditions. This project was started, but not finished, by Walter Hill. Incidentally, rumor has it that some of the additional footage and at least some of the final edit was assembled by none other than Francis Ford Coppola. Another director, not a big name this time, (Jack Sholder of Wishmaster 2) also worked on the film.It is a space epic more or less directly derivative of Alien. A small space crew answers a mysterious distress call, and ends up taking aboard a mysterious artifact which turns out to be irreconcilable with human life. Actually, they went it one better. This artifact is incompatible with the universe.This film is really for genre addicts only. There is nothing original or deep about it. I feel confident you'll know exactly what's coming in every scene. In its current 90 minute cut, it's too short for interesting character development, it has several plot holes, and it has a sappy happy ending.It also features a very odd impersonation of Tom Cruise, as performed by Peter Facinelli, who mimics Cruise's smile, his voice, and his mannerisms. Facinelli is taller, and not as handsome, but the overall effect is remarkable. It is almost as if it were calculated.This movie bombed big time with both critics, and filmgoers. It garnered 90% negative reviews, and the positive reviews weren't all that enthusiastic. Despite wide release, it grossed only 14 million dollars on a 60 million dollar budget. Strangely, I found the DVD worthwhile. Oh, the movie is completely predictable, but it isn't as bad as people said it was. I suppose critics were predisposed to hate it because they were shut out of a pre-screening, and because they were aware of the director troubles in the production. Who's going to write a good review of a movie obviously dumped by the studio and three directors?Don't get me wrong, it isn't a good movie, but it had some decent visuals, more or less capable characterizations, and was mercifully short, so I was able to watch most of it without the FF. But the film itself is not the reason to rent the DVD. In my opinion, there is a good reason to rent it. There are more than a dozen deleted scenes, all fully scored, and these allow to to see how the original movie was a completely different movie - with a philosophical overlay and a deeply distressing ending. (The entire universe is doomed, and the evil guy is not destroyed by being ejected from the ship.) Moreover, there were other sub-plots, an explicit autopsy was performed on a character who was cut from the final version, another live person was found on the contaminated colony, the computer voices were different, two computers were later consolidated into one, etc. From these deleted scenes you can see the movie that might have been and compare it to what resulted. I won't tell you that the other movie was better, but it was different, probably much longer, and I found it interesting to speculate as to why they changed what they did.

Of course, Event Horizon wasn't all that wonderful either, but it's not much different than this mishmash of overbaked sci-fi hyperbole.But for those of you who didn't see Event Horizon - and I suspect that's a lot of you - here's your basic plot. Rescue vessel Nightingale, drifting rather aimlessly through space, receives a mysterious, distant distress call. Who has sent it? Is there free beer on board? So many questions. Bear in mind there are hardly any distress calls in deep space movies that are neither distant nor mysterious. So we're already mired in the muck of overdone drivel. Star Trek was here before, but even it wasn't the first. No, you'd have to go back to the earliest days of the caveman, when Og looked up at the skies and told his kids a yarn about how some peabrains on a spaceship answered a distress call.And of course, when they answer the call, there's gonna be problems. Like their ship falling apart. Like them finding an injured man and taking him on board (always a no-no, it seems, in these movies). And like the members of the crew being plucked off, one by one, like birds on a wire. It's like Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, only instead of guns and knives, people die in much more fascinating ways, like floating in space, and none of the characters has a British accent. Same concept, though.As for the cast, Angela Basset's in this - how far she's come/fallen since When a Man Loves a Woman! - and so is James Spader. And so is Lou Diamond Phillips - what is this, an 80's reunion? Where's Ally Sheedy? Where's Andrew McCarthy? The actors are given little to say or do that's of any substance; they all take a back seat to the effects, which truly are special. So bottom line for you, folks - not a bad little movie, for what it is, which is a meaningless pile of pseudo-interesting junk. A good popcorn film, as they said in the old days.

It was seriously like a kind of soft porno set in space, the sexual theme carrying right on until the very end. In fact, the closing lines of the film were sexual in nature.

Robert Forster had little more than a cameo role, and even when in extreme physical distress he seemed bored.The plot is derivative from so many others and not as well realized. A distress call brings a medical vessel into contact with a distant mining colony with just one survivor - who is brought on board with some packages one crewman is stupid enough to open. Very stupid. The survivor is also stupidly not placed under guard or confinement even when the captain leaves the ship to recover something on the colony. Not very likely. The crew of this space ship did indeed seem remarkably dumb, including a sexually-addicted female. The special effects are good, but somehow unfulfilling due to the plot. Most of all, I never really cared much about the crewmen, not even the Angela Basset character. And characters we are not involved with equals a substandard movie.When I saw this film one afternoon in a theater of 200 seats I was the only one there.

And there's no sun (or star) bigger than a blue giant.  So, what went wrong?  First off, there's zero character development.  We hardly get to know the characters throughout the entire movie, except for their main quality (this one's smart, this one's a hero, this one's crazy).  Also, we are thrust right into the story, without much of an exposition.  I guess the producers figured we would already know the characters.(WARNING Minor spoiler)And why bother with killing the captain?  It's seemed like a Oops, he died. In other news... situation.  We know the facts behind the reason of his death, but why even have him in the movie if he's only in there for about 15 minutes?(WARNING Spoiler)Another thing what's with the artifact?  It had so much potential (after all, the things 9-dimensional!).  But again, it was wasted, as the only thing it's good for is blowing up a star.  Which brings me to my next point...(WARNING Major spoiler)The supernova sucked.  Picture the explosion created by a dying blue giant, hundreds of times larger than our sun.  Picture the shockwave vaporizing anything and everything in its path.  Picture the heroes desperately trying to escape.  Now picture the whole thing lasting for about 5 seconds.  What a HUGE disappointment.  Also, the computer aboard the ship says the resulting explosion will reach Earth in 51 years, and will either destroy our planet, or create new life.  But do we get to find out what happens?  No.  All we get is the fact that the two survivors switched an eyeball each, and the woman is pregnant.  Whoopee.  In summary, this movie is like a 31 chapter book.  The director decides to start on chapter 2, and then skips every other chapter, effectively missing both the beginning and the end.

There is no credits of any kind nor is the title shown; they show the MGM logo and then it starts right into a shot of the ship Nightingale. The title of the movie is shown at the end of the movie and during the ending credits. The reason for this is that directors and producers kept quitting during production so they had to keep replacing the directors and producers. It's a wonder they finished the project at all; it's a good thing this movie is only 97 minutes long any longer this movie would have really sucked. Supernova is ok as these really bad science fiction movies go; it is better then last year's first bad stinker of the year Wing Commander. The reason why I say this movie was better then Wing Commander was the fact there was a lot of sex and you do get to see the tits of a good looking chick (and unfortunately butt of Nick) so there was a little less pointless chit-chat. The problem with both films is the fact that they are kind of like watching an episode of a television series. The sex and nudity is the only thing that can't be done on prime time TV but the rest of it can be on TV. Supernova really doesn't much of a plot; the violence in this film doesn't happen until near the end but the films action sequences don't offer anything special.

Walter Hill has removed his name, in favor of the new Alan Smithee name Thomas Lee.It's not that bad.

The crew gradually begins to suspect the man of having ulterior motives, and mayhem ensues.MGM must have cut the gore out of this movie, because there are a few scenes that seem like they should have been longer.  They did, however leave in a few gratuitous male butt shots and some brief female nudity, garnering the PG-13 for what might have made it as a PG without it.  My companions and I sat watching this movie in the theater and giving it the MST3K treatment. If viewed in that frame of mind, Supernova is fairly amusing stuff.

I gave most of all the alien movies a 10. Thats what seems to be wrong with the movies these days like End of Days and star wars the phantom menace(which I gave an 8 too), they seem to hook you in, but never really takes you to the limit with the story and animation, it gives you a great taste, and that seems to be it. I remember the old days with Aliens , Raiders, and Return of the Jedi, and smile and wish it was like that again, when they took you to the limit with their story and animation.

I wasn't expecting a great movie, I didn't go into this movie to be blown away--I expected little, but I got even less than that out of the movie.

While he can hardly be blamed (the movie is awful), you have to wonder why he signed on to film such a foolish script in the first place.But then, who can tell what the script was like?  As it is, it's an incoherent mess sparked by some good performances.  Technically, it's absurd; this, folks, is an ambulance ship.  One of the features of any ambulance is the ability to transport patients in order to get better care than the ambulance crew can provide.  But this ship only has enough dimensional pods for the crew -- so where would patients be placed? Great care is taken to show us that some of the ship rotates to provide gravity in the form of centrifugal force.  However, the bridge doesn't rotate -- and still has gravity.Technical goofs like this, however, are very minor compared to a story that is incapable of making a link between the Weird Object that's brought on board, and the transformations the patient is undergoing. The story required him to become superhuman, so he does, even though this has nothing to do with the danger the Weird Object represents.  (Which is incoherently explained anyway.)Also, the film has obviously been hacked at in order to get a more acceptable rating than R.  So most of the fights consist of the bad guy flinging other people around.  There are other signs of severe trimming too, not the least of which is that in magazines covering the film, there are photos of a monster that doesn't appear in the finished film at all.What a mess.

I was most reminded of Event Horizon (another flawed but generally watchable movie) although after the first 20 minutes Supernova fails to display the originality that Event Horizon at least aimed for (even if it never paid off).  At it's core, Supernova is a rewrite of Alien with a human as the villain instead of an extraterrestrial.  There are few surprises, nothing that resembles a plot twist and even the methods used to dispatch the support characters are rather mundane.  The climax is formulaic and the main threat never seems all that threatening.  The effects are good but in today's age of computers, spaceships & explosions aren't that much.  One scene however had such horrid blue screening (a zero-g tryst between the villain & a minor female character) that one wonders how it remained in the film.Yes, I'm being harsh but the film really wasn't that bad, it just wasn't that good either.

I first read about it in Fangoria and got excited because Geoffrey (Romper Stomper) Wright was directing it.  Well then he was fired, quite, or as they say had creative diffrences and Walter (48hrs.,Last man Standing) Hill was directing, well Hill directed i think every shot you see in the movie but wanted to do some reshoots that were denied so he left during the editing and Jack (The Hidden, Nightmare on elm street 2, Wishmaster 2) Sholder took over, well i don't know what happened to him but THEN Francis Ford Copolla came in to do the editing (he must really be slumming to take over editing chores on a movie he didn't direct...or was offered a nice check).  Well from there i don't know what happened but Walter Hill took the name of Thomas Lee for the director credit.  So the movie was......GOOD not great but good.  It did feel kinda rushed (due to the editing i'm sure) and there were scenes in the previews that were not in the film (like a cool looking scene of a deformed looking person telling Angela Bassett to help him/it) and i cannot believe Robert Forster was in the movie for only what 5 minutes he's not a big actor but i thought he was on a come back after Jackie Brown (he probably had more scenes that were cut out).  The last two issues of Fangoria also show an autopsy scene that looked nice and gory where Angela Bassett was cutting into a body which is'nt in the movie and Peter Facinelli's character Troy mutates into a hairless creature resembling the clones at the end of the Judge Dredd movie is shown in the same two issues but is not in the movie. So why all the trouble I don't know but MGM has butchered other Sci-fi/horror movies (remember Disturbing Behavior) for hopes of gaining a wider audience when all they end up doing is HURTING their movie and as much as i like them space ship movies have not did so well lately (Alienresurrection, Event Horizon both didn't do well) so MGM probably spent more money in the long run and even though i liked Supernova and want it to do good it probably won't so they lost more money in the long run i'm sure (congratulations MGM guys, in the long run you screwed yourselves).

Visual effects are stunning, and story is interesting. Directed by Walter Hill under a Pseudonym! Basically, the film seems to be about changes - The Gimmick of the film is a Bomb that will destroy, but also rebuild, life (as in the Genesis Device from Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan) - But not a direct ripoff of that gimmick, just similar. Also similar to the Necromonger Religion of The Chronicles of Riddick - Where the Necromongers must destroy every planet in the known universe before they can go to the new, unspoiled Underverse, so this is not a new concept in science fiction destruction gadgets, just an interesting one.The Gimmick has a physical affect on the characters of Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips) and mostly on Troy Larson (Knox White/Peter Facinelli) who becomes Karl Larson and so they used two different, but very similar looking actors to play the Larson character, White and Facinelli... And I really haven't been able to tell where the change between actors is, perhaps it is one momentary change, or maybe they actually swap actors after a point, but the character still looks like the same person, although he is changing constantly.The ship, which is basically a deep space ambulance, responds to a call that could be considered if happening today, as a call coming in directly to the ambulance without the benefit of dialing 911 - And also, coming from a person known to a member of the crew of the ship, making the call very odd indeed.ON arrival at the the origin of the emergency call, a junk ship meets up with our ambulance and docks, containing one unconscious Troy Larson, alleged son of Karl Larson who placed the call. And that is where all the fun begins, at first this person seems to be an innocent teenager, as the film progresses, the character physically changes - From Skinny to Muscular, using bare hands to crush Lou Diamond Phillips Skull and smashes parts of the ship to pieces as if they are (and probably were) Tinsel.Although the last 1/3rd of the film has some insidiously sinister aspects, the ending actually leaves you with a good feeling, plus the ending is quite humorous, when you consider that Bassett and Spader, sharing a CryoTube, had a kind of Material/Fluid Exchange? - I laughed out loud when I heard THAT I'm sure it was not intended to be humorous, but it is. When you think of what kind of activities there are to do while trapped in a CryoTube during a Supernova? And the film cleverly skips over the details of such, shall we say... Activities? Amen!As seen on the Sci Fi channel, many parts are hacked and cut from the film and finally seeing the entire uncut film, is much more enjoyable, making those things which interest me in the film all that much more interesting.This film is similar in some ways to Solaris, which was written by Stanislaw E Lem... Some of the premises are similar- Namely the idea of a large cosmic structure, in both films, these structures are Stars. In this case the star awaiting impending doom- Is it some kind of intelligence?Compare that to Solaris, and there are similarities- I forget the main premise of SuperNova... But that little item about a huge cosmic structure having intelligence is common to both films, but delivered quite differently in Supernova, a more subtle way.

As the plot unfolds we begin to realize that there _is_ an alien civilization out there somewhere, but also that they may not want to be found, that they may be fearful or aggressive toward other civilizations, and that they are quite advanced, though we may, with time, grasp their technology. X - Spoiler coming--Spoiler below----------- OTOH this spoiler may be necessary for some viewers to understand the movie.There is no alien in the movie. Indeed, one of the movie's premises is that humankind has not yet encountered another intelligent species.There is however a beautiful alien artifact that, for humans, has regenerative powers and (later surmised) tremendous power to destroy. The artifact also causes those who experience its regenerative powers to become addicted to it and to slowly grow mad (which, in the end, turns out to save mankind). These alien artifacts are apparently seeded throughout the universe by an advanced civilization so that members of other civilizations will find them and take them home, whereupon the alien device fulfills its second function as a civilization-destroying bomb. So one possibility is that, to the movie's alien civilization, the alien artifact is like AMDRO and human civilization (and others) are like fire ants. Quite a different perspective from your everyday science fiction, and one with tremendous vision and bite. And IMO this fantastic idea could yield any number of follow-up movies.

The stupid medical robot thing looked like an 8th grade science project.  The only cool part of the movie were the dimensional transportation scenes, but that isn't saying much. There is no explanation given as to why the villain aquires his powers, and his relationship with Angela Basset is glossed over.  The sad thing is that people were paid to create this junker.  Normally, I like bad movies if you can laugh at them (Hard Rock Zombies), but not this one.  This movie had so much potential that was wasted on gratuitous nudity shots and such.  I apologize if this review is messy, but having just seen it, my mental stat e is damaged.  Avoid this at all costs, unless you want to be flabberghasted by a horrible plot, acting, effects, etc for 90 minutes.

I wish that I could leave my comment with that one word but IMDB says I must have at least four lines. So, what was Angela Bassett, James Spader and Lou Diamond Phillips thinking? No let me rephrase the last sentence, they weren't thinking. The writer of this screenplay must have created this monstrosity on the set one scene at a time. Had they been able to read the script ahead of time, they would have been able to say, No, thanks! Will someone explain to me what the nudity was for? And I love to see nude scenes. So when I have to question the purpose and would rather that they be left out, then a movie must be in pretty poor taste. This movie stunk worse than putrefied garbage. The directing was terrible therefore not complimenting the actors (and I'm a big Angela Bassett fan) and they all stunk. I refuse to continue with my comments because I'm getting upset.

Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13. (for sexuality, nudity, and sci-fi violence)What a bad position for the film industry to start out the new year with. Supernova may just be the year's worst film--and it's only January. There is such little intelligence, characterization and structure existent. I was never intrigued, but daydreaming throughout the entire production's running time. This is a complete waste of time--a true walk out.Supernova is a movie in which there is almost no story, only briefly related concepts sloppily quilted together with imagination-deadening special effects and action sequences. What plot there is centers around a space vessel on a mission to recover a distress call. The crew consists of Nick Vanzant (James Spader), Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips), Danika Lund (Robin Tunney), A.J. Marley (Robert Forster) and Benjamin Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz). They become endangered species when a mysterious man named Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli) is recruited on board in reference to the rescue mission. He also brings a bright extraterrestrial object with him, one that not only disguise his identity, but also retransforms his body with youth.Shall we count the ways Supernova  recycles its plot?1.  The method the filmmakers choose to execute the villain's defense, which consists of self healing power and eternal youth. This concept is from the visually arousing Terminator 2 Judgment Day.2.  The movie's crew is stranded aboard a large ship in the presence of some kind of extraterrestrial object that beholds great powers. Remember the circular power source in Sphere?3.  In 1998's Star Trek Insurrection, a mysterious race on an isolated planet withholds the power of eternal youth. That vary idea is present in this piece of garbage.4.  Event Horizon contained a possessed human as the villain, who gradually eliminated the crew members of a massive deserted space craft containing an unknown object. Exactly like the antagonist and space ship of Supernova.I could barely understand anything that was going on in the story, and what I did understand bored me. The entire plot is strained out of nothing. There is no explanation of why certain events and motives take place, or what the extraterrestrial object's purpose is. When we do finally receive an explanation of what is happening, which is well into the second half, it is already too late for the film to achieve anything with its material. We needed introduction near the beginning, not half way through.Supernova inherits no introduction of its characters, motives, intentions, or situations. Nor does it bother to develop any of the above. The most maturation we get of a character is a brief line of dialogue explaining one's social position. Because of this horrible misfortune the filmmakers precede in, I despised the characters here. Each is immoral, and or nasty in their own way, thus much of the time, I was rooting for the bad guy to attack some interest for us. However, instead of giving us with a variety of gruesome encounters between Troy and the other crew members, we acquire several brief, lifeless assaults that lack so much passion it is a shame I gave the antagonist any hope in the first place.There is a lot of sexual content in this film, enough to give the PG-13 rating a serious run for its money. The sensual scenes have no impact, though, because no romantic chemistry is present. There is a difference between love and sex. Like the tagline to Chasing Amy states, Sex it easy, love is hard, the writers of Supernova forget attempting the difficulties of developing a chemistry rich relationship between anyone in the movie. Although there was some believability with the characters of Lou Diamond Phillips and Robin Tunney. For the most part, however, the writers provide us with muscular, shirtless males, tight fitted, when clothed, females, and sexual encounters that only lead the immorality destruction of the characters.I am a little flabbergasted to see so many names listed in the film's cast list. Such actors as James Spader, Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, and Robert Forster, who are all capable of better performances than what they have contributed in this disaster of a science fiction flick. Even these popular performers can't elevate beyond the indecisive dialogue and self destructive plot provided for them.According to my sources, the director of Supernova isn't a man named Thomas Lee, but several higher ranked directors who have enlisted themselves behind a false identity. I will not reveal who these veterans are. I understand their concerns for their futures as directors. If the actual directors of this movie refuse to reveal their names to their audiences, what does that tell you about the movie?Brought to you by MGM Productions.

From this some fatal consequences occur. The ship is now stuck as the fuel is low and they rescue a small craft, which has a crafty, mysterious stranger and hidden alien artifact. This stranger hides something about this artifact and crew are now unravelling the dangerous secret of their guest and his luggage.Does it deserve its bad wrap? Well, it's awfully dispirited, but not the worst I've seen. But hey, it would make a good bedtime story, since I couldn't stop yawning throughout. But that wasn't the only thing, as I was getting headache from watching it. I remember when this film came out and the hype that surrounded it. It was a very troubled shoot, with Walter Hill leaving the project and using the name Thomas Lee for the credits. Then Francis Ford Coppola was given a chance to fix it up, but it looks like no one could undo the mess that we got. After being released, it died a slow death at the box office! So after the god awful 'Marabunta' I saw a couple days ago, the next flick I came to watching was this garbage. Ah, actually 'Marabunta' might be inept, but at least it wasn't damn sleep inducing like 'Supernova'.The production design is pure eye candy, with some impressive special effects that are nice to look at. These effects were brought to us by Digital Domain, which won an academy for their work on 'Titanic'. They add a bright and colourful frame to the film with there stunning visuals. The eyes might have been entertained, but ears had to go through a sorry state of weak and mechanical dialogue. The script just didn't make a whole lotta sense; I was just dumbfounded to what was actually going on and what was the deal about this alien artifact. Strangely in the extras there are (so many) deleted scenes, which would actually add more depth to the plot, but they hit the cutting room floor instead. They make much more sense and add more cohesion than that of the film. Although I'm happy that the alternate opening sequence was cut because it plain wishy-washy, but the alternate ending I thought was vastly better than with the one they went with. Which came across as rushed and cheated on the audience by being too sweet. My guess for those scenes being cut out was that they wanted the suffering to be over quickly for the audience. And if so, no way did that help! Obviously this flick heavily borrowed chunks from old to recent Sci-fi films (even add the TV series E.R) and 'Supernova' doesn't pull it off graciously at all. A lack of creativity really does hurt it, big time. Some things did get on my nerves like why let strange fella roam the space ship that they don't trust? Some moments felt contrived and where was the tension, there wasn't an ounce of it. Yep, nothing detected from my part. It's all about a horny space crew who are floating in space, aimlessly doing some irrelevant junk, oops I almost forgot and performing heroics. Couple of times I got up to do something without pausing because nothing really is happening to make you pause or that its not making the slightest bit of sense that you really aren't missing out on anything of importance. Importance? Who am I kidding! Sure the effects are presented in glossy manner, but I just couldn't help but feel cold and disconnected to everything else.The performances are rather bogged down, with nothing memorable about them. What was a cast like this thinking, obviously they weren't. Who got the likes of James Spader, Angela Bassett and Robert Forster, who do nothing out of the ordinary but come to play stale characters? Then you got the likes of Robin Tunney and Lou diamond Philips. So what we got here is a above-average cast who look like they don't know what they are doing there and trying to come to grips with there shamble of a script. It's B-grade screenplay with A-grade production. Although, some of the production wasn't too crash hot, the editing was feebly put together and the soporific camera-work just comes off amateurish at times. Didn't they know how to zoom out, because most of the running time the camera shots were right up there? I guess that is what was giving me the headache.The DVD cover tells us we're going to watch the uncut version - not seen at cinema - but honestly it was truly tame, so what was added in? Was it the oh-so many sex scenes, nudity shots because the violence was lacking, especially in originality.With an appalling screenplay like this you'll be thinking how did this ever get the green light. It's simply a dud and a real boring one too.

Out of the blue they receive an emergency distress call from a supposedly abandoned mining planet called 'Titan 37', when they get there the gravitational pull of the planet damages the Nightingale & results in the loss of fuel. A small spacecraft from the surface of Titan 37 docks with the Nightingale containing a man named Troy Larson (the IMDb is wrong as Peter Facinelli plays Troy not Karl). The spacecraft also contains a strange unidentifiable object, an object that turns out could wipe out the entire universe which Troy wants & which Troy will kill for...Well, where do I start with Supernova? First of all I think it's fair to point out that Supernova, originally to be known as 'Dead Star', apparently had a very troubled production history, originally to be directed by Geoffrey Wright he quit after the usual differences with the studio, the project was then passed onto Walter Hill who obviously shot things his way which the studio wasn't happy about so Hill disowned the film & the first trailer went out with the director credited as Alan Smithee (a name any director would use who wanted to take their name off the finished film) but that name was scrapped & the director is listed as Thomas Lee, but it doesn't end there as Jack Sholder & Francis Ford Coppola were brought in to make the film more commercial I would imagine although the extent of their involvement is unclear as to whether it was just re-editing the film or indeed re-shooting certain scenes, maybe we'll never really know for sure & don't go expecting a director's commentary on the DVD anytime soon! Add to this to the fact that Supernova was shelved by it's studio for quite a while & it's somewhat surprising that I didn't think it was too bad. The script by David C. Wilson plays a lot like Alien (1979) to start with, the lonely isolated crew on-board a spacecraft receiving a distress signal & discovering some sort of alien menace but towards it's climax it turns into a bit of a cat & mouse thriller. As a whole while it's a little patchy, uneven & unfocused there are some decent ideas here that could have made for a pretty good Sci-Fi thriller if not for the production problems. I have to say it feels like two different sets of director's & editors worked on it but two perfectly competent ones. One area where I must praise Supernova are it's special effects, while not as flashy as many films the CGI here is excellent & truly some of the most impressive I've ever seen. With a supposed budget of $60,000,000 technically Supernova has a very odd look throughout, the entire film seems shot in blue hues & tones, peoples eyes are lit differently to the rest of their features in many, many scenes & for some bizarre reason there are lots of shaky hand held camera jerky type shots when on-board the Nightingale but outside when full CGI is used the camera is rock steady & wobble free which also gave Supernova a disjointed uneven feel to me. The acting is OK but not much character background is given for them to work with & a special mention goes to Cruz as the token comic relief black guy who is just plain annoying & puts in a poor performance. Basically Supernova obviously suffered badly because of it's production problems although I can't say I think it's a really bad film it's certainly an uneven & sporadic one that entertains & interests on occasion while it bores & confuses on others. Slightly below average but I think it's worth watching if your a Sci-Fi fan, others should wait to see it on TV for free rather than spend hard earned cash on it, a real curiosity.

It takes more than one viewing to realize how great this movie really could have been. The first time I saw this movie I thought that the plot kind of dangled and the movie gets kind of boring after a while. The second time I viewed this movie I figured out that the plot isn't suppose to matter one bit because MGM sure as hell didn't keep one in. Originally, there was actually more going on in the movie than we are shown. From viewing some of the deleted scenes from Hill's version, it's clear that there was a potential four star classic here. Hill could have done for sci-fi what he did for the buddy genre. I guess the reason why I din't hate this movie so much despite being somewhat of a mess is because of Robin Tunney. Robin Tunney gives the best performance in the movie and I'm surprised there were not more scenes with her in them in the final cut. As for the special effects, just by watching the preview you can tell that they are absolutely amazing. Walter Hill or whoever the director/directors were did a fantastic job directing this movie at times, but then it becomes obvious so much of it was re-shot. In addition to Hill, I suspect the writers got cheated as well. There is a smarter, better script in there that was obviously rewritten by the studio. As mentioned before, I rented SUPERNOVA on DVD where they have twenty minutes of deleted scenes. The movie was too short and some of the deleted scenes were truly excellent so I wish MGM would release a special edition DVD where they add in the deleted scenes to the movie and put in some director's commentary (or somebody's commentary) because I really want to know the mind-blowing special effects were done.

Upon hearing a distress call the captain of the vessel, A. J. Marley (Robert Forster) makes the decision to make a dimension jump in order to get to the mining colony that issued the plea for help. However, upon doing so he is killed in the process and the spacecraft is badly damaged as well. Fortunately, his co-pilot Nick Vanzant (James Spader) takes charge and manages to save the ship. It's at this time that they rescue a survivor from the mining colony who carries with him an alien object which is of huge importance to all concerned. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that I thought it was a decent science-fiction film for the most part. Although I liked the performances of James Spader and Angela Bassett (as Dr. Kaela Evers) I didn't think there was much chemistry between the two and this caused the movie to seem a bit awkward. I should probably also add that there are two versions of this movie&#x97;one is rated PG and the other is rated R. Having never seen the PG version I cannot comment on whether it is better or worse than the R version but in any event I liked the particular one I saw and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.

I like my sci-fi and this popped up on Netflix. I'd heard over and over how bad it was, how utterly dire but hey, it was something for in the background.I was surprised, it's nowhere near as bad as I expected. There are plenty of influences around - for example, the FTL sleep chamber is clearly borrowed from Aliens. Lots of elements from other sources are combined here and it could have been excellent, if not for the studio. The tales around the interference of the studio with this project are well known and Supernova should serve as a stark warning to film studios everywhere - don't interfere, let your directors do what you hired them to do (make your movie).The interference stands out because there are moments where you can see the film trying to flex its muscles - references to violent entertainment being outlawed, human breeding is controlled and so on. There's an interesting universe in Supernova, waiting to be explored. But the studio wanted sex. They wanted zero-g sex. They wanted more sex. And violence, oh yes violence - odd given the commentary earlier about violent entertainment. And it's not sex, but several of the clich√©s around sex are there too. Robin Tunney's (looking very attractive with the whole pixie cut hair do) character is at it like a space rabbit with Lou Diamond Phillips. When she eventually gives in to the advances of Peter Facinelli, who by this point has been revealed as the villain of the piece to the audience, you know exactly what is going to happen. Yep, within 5 minutes of the deed, she is dead, flushed out of a convenient airlock. So, sex sells but we still get the sex is dirty, girls who enjoy sex are evil nonsense.It is at moments like this that you can all but see the hands of the studio, interfering. But there's some good stuff lurking here, the form of FTL - even with the Aliens like capsule chamber - is well depicted, along with the idea that this is not always a safe method of travel. Questions around artificial intelligence circle the computer Sweetie, but are brushed aside for sex and aggression. The extra-dimensional stuff feels almost tacked on, again thanks to the sex. This could have made for some really interesting stuff, but it is brushed aside in favour of less cerebral subjects.This is an abject lesson in what studio meddling can do to a film. It's not great - it could have been very good had it been left alone - but it's not as terrible as some suggest. I'd give it 5.5, but the system doesn't allow for that so a 6 it is.

Also at the beginning of the film, the captain was watching Tom & Jerry, how strange. There wasn't that much action in the film and the story and acting were very plain.

Despite the presence of some excellent visual effects, this slick looking production is nondescript on just about every level. It's impossible to really give a damn about any of the characters, and the script, credited to David C. Wilson (based on a story by William Malone and Daniel Chuba) is seriously muddled. This material could have used some serious fleshing out. As it is, it may be watchable for die hard fans of the sci-fi and horror genres, but it's quite forgettable.This usually solid and reliable cast just looks lost at times. James Spader, Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, Wilson Cruz, and Robert Forster star. They play the crew of a medical rescue spaceship who respond to a distress signal and pick up an enigmatic stranger (Peter Facinelli). Not surprisingly, he turns out to be a danger, and to add to the difficulties, there's a mysterious alien artifact discovered as well.The movie lost this viewer early on, and he couldn't believe the filmmakers were actually serious with some of the material they presented. It's not a good sign when the script is cluttered over and over with awkward exposition, some of it uttered by the computer intelligence (named Sweetie!) that rarely if ever shuts up. Forster is actually written out of the action early on --- lucky him. The ladies are lovely - and for those interested, they do show some skin - and Bassett is playing a reasonably strong character. But the only performer who looks like he's in the swing of things is Facinelli, who does seem to be enjoying this part that he's playing. It is indeed amusing to see Spader and Phillips looking so incredibly pumped up.For those who don't already know, the director name Thomas Lee is a pseudonym. Walter Hill began the project, but the studio was unhappy with the finished product and it sat around for a while, and both Jack Sholder and none other than Francis Ford Coppola were brought in to fudge around with it some more.It would be interesting to see what Hill originally intended. Most likely, it would have been a more intriguing experience than this.Four out of 10.

Like most people, I thought it looked great at the time, but really didn't have much else going for it. My opinion hasn't really changed since re-visiting it. The special effects and design are still the highlight of a sci-fi film that suffers from simply maintaining the status genre quo and offering nothing new.The medical ship Nightingale 229 travels through deep space in the early 22nd century taking on search and rescue missions it's assigned to. Its six-member crew includes a Captain and Pilot (Robert Forster), a co-pilot (James Spader), a medical officer (Angela Bassett, a medical technician (Luo Diamond Phillips), a search and rescue paramedic (Robin Tunney), and a computer technician (Wilson Cruz). When their vessel, the Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from a comet mining operation in a distant galaxy, the crew soon finds itself in danger from the mysterious young man they rescue, the alien artifact he's smuggled aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant star about to supernova. The resulting explosion will be the most massive explosion in the universe.What was originally planned as a low-budget study of human relationships amongst the stars quickly mutated into a rather lackluster action yarn about picking up a stray and his alien artifact. Of course we all know the object can't be good and the whole situation goes south very quickly in a matter of 90 minutes. It's evident by the way the movie progresses in a very choppy and rushed pace that there was more to the story than what we get here. There were 15 minutes of deleted scenes for the movie included, so I can only imagine there has to be even more footage lying in a box somewhere out there. The cast would be considered an ensemble these days since most of the actors have gone on to do bigger and better things since Supernova. James Spader, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robert Forster, and Angela Bassett were already established stars at the time of this movie's release. Peter Facinelli went on to play the patriarch of the Cullen vampire clan, Carlisle, in The Twilight Saga. Robin Tunney worked on Prison Break and continues as a member of the cast of The Mentalist. Here they just walk around angry with grim looks on their faces. Supernova is rated R for sci-fi action violence and sensuality / nudity. There are at least two topless shots of Robin Tunney and a rather explicit love scene. Director Walter Hill (operating under the pseudonym Thomas Lee) was definitely fascinated with the human body. He stalls on one shot of Peter Facinelli's backend for what seems like an eternity. Angela Bassett gets her opportunity to bare all, albeit in the shadows, as well. There's an acceptable amount of gore as Facinelli's character continuously gets beat upon. However, even this aspect of the film seems uneven. Sometimes we get to see the carnage, while at others it's edited out nice and neat. Although there really isn't much going on here in a spiritual sense, one line of dialogue that James Spader utters stood out to me. When the crew is coming to grips with the chain of events Peter Facinelli's character has unraveled, he makes a bold statement. Spader proclaims, What if they didn't crucify Christ, but they did! He uses such an extreme example to explain that it doesn't matter what could've been. What's more important is dealing with what is. Angela Bassett's character also dramatically makes a comparison between aliens and God when she says, Whoever they are, they're as smart as God and a lot less nice. I don't think so.Supernova isn't completely void of any entertainment value. It just lacks the endeavor to be anything more than a slick sci-fi action yarn. It will remind you of the awkward era of filmmaking when studios were transitioning from working with real models and sets and moving into the arena of CGI effects. If you've ran out of other alien encounter movies, this will tide you over until something new and bolder comes along.

But it isn't, it just borrows liberally from it.I always thought James Spader was an outstanding actor; he can work more acting into a wordless stare than anyone else in the business. He does remarkably well here, lifting the material above its mediocre source with his icy screen presence. Angela Bassett is similarly cool and controlled, her purposeful acting style lending some much needed validity to the tepid script.The special effects in this film are a curious mixture of state-of-the-art and b-movie; there are some wonderful exterior shots of various spaceships and shuttles, and an elaborate set built to show a mining expedition, which must have cost a fortune. Then they trot out that clumsy robot with the cheap face mask, and have James Spader studying glowing dots on a transparent screen as if they mean something, and it's hard to suspend disbelief.The plot is incomprehensible; apparently the egg-shaped thing is a bomb, whose making and implementation exceeds the comprehension of the human mind, yet Angela Bassett decodes it as easily as if she were doing a Sudoku puzzle. The ship's onboard computer Suzie (HAL? Mother?) is gifted with an unnecessary fuzzy logic as she quarrels with James Spader; was it supposed to be cute or funny? It was neither.This was a weird, interesting film, and a textbook example of mining too many clich√©s, complete with the annoying convenience of an antagonist who reveals his motives in long, explanatory speeches (this tactic does not drive the story forward, it is simply one step away from the laziest of storytelling the narrative voice-over).And I really don't see Coppolla's touch anywhere in this film, does anyone see it?

As many have stated, Supernova revolves around a medical rescue team. After responding to a distress call some 3000 light year away, the crew rescue the mysterious caller/survivor who eventually brings havoc upon the crew. Also there is alien plot that is used fairly well, albeit underdeveloped. Genuinely, I enjoy this film. With a generic horror plot, supernova actually is able to space itself from similar SciFi films, with its visually slick, clean, spacious futuristic metro sets, that are rarely seen in SciFi films. Also, I love Lloyd Aherns cool, almost colorless somewhat glossy cinematography. AS far as I understand about the history of it's troubled production Walter Hill replaced the original director, filmed the movie and worked on post production effects and editing before quitting. Hill, upset over the creative control he did not posses during and after filming, left the film half edited and up *shat* creek. The makers brought in quack director jack Shoulder to re-shoot what they wanted and lighten the films tone. Apparently Jack changed the ships A.I. computer Sweetie's voice to one sounding like a phone sex operator, as opposed to the female sounding Hal originally conceived. I assume, but not sure we can thank him for the minor comedic quips that felt tonally out of place. Sholder edited a different version with his and Hill's footage. It's unclear why, but Jack left, and desperate, the makers employed Francis Ford Coppola to allegedly re-shoot and reedit a final cut of his own. Supposedly Francis added the zero gravity sex science between James Spader and Angela Basset, who is REALLY a digitally darkened Robin Tunney , and Peter Facinelli. Finally, Voila you have Supernova, a decent SciFi horror/thriller with no discernible director to credit. Had Walter completed his original version, as seen from deleted scenes, it could have possibly been the gritty, dark, unnerving experimental Science Fiction movie intended. Instead the viewer is relegated to it's subtle theme of Darwinism, the overt theme of human carnal desires and an A.I. computer capable of understanding love .....I know its a long shot but hopefully a blu- ray release will contain Hill's assembly cut.

Not as dull as Danny Boyle's similar cash-in for the Alien sweepstakes, but very poorly scripted.The oddest thing was my accidental timing -against virtually impossible odds I was watching while switching back and forth from the Sonia Sottomayor first day Senate hearings for her confirmation to the Supreme Court. Both the film and the hearings needed some relief; in the movie's case it was too idiotic to watch straight through, while the windbags of both parties made the hearing almost as difficult to watch -the entire 3 hours plus was Grassley, Whitehouse, Sessions and friends pontificating for the folks back home in their endless 10-minute opening statements (only Sen. Graham cut through the clich√©s with his patented straight talk, probably being the only Republican who will vote for her). Then near the end of the film I heard Angela Bassett mention Sotomayor and I thought I was dreaming -but the end credits confirmed that one of the cast's token minorities (Lou Diamond Phillips always gets multiple credit), Wilson Cruz (like Judge Sonia, a native New Yorker of Puerto Rican ancestry) was portraying one Benj Sotomejor. Other than the alternate spelling, what are the odds of me renting this obscure (read bad) Netflix movie and watching it simultaneously with the Sotomayor hearings? The film itself demonstrates the problem with genre pics since the '70s and certainly after Jaws and Star Wars became the biggest hits of their time, what we used to enjoy innocently on Saturday afternoons at the low budget level of George Pal or Milland's Panic in Year Zero suddenly became the BIG films. So a Z-grade project like Supernova gets a big budget, studio preference (how low MGM had fallen from the time of 2001 A Space Odyssey) and even some decent, if thin casting. Actors like Angela Bassett and James Spader look like they are performing under protest, and in a way they are -both would like to be involved in some meaningful project instead of this paycheck-programmer. In the '50s the A movies were accorded to Stanley Kramer and Elia Kazan and were important films with something to say, and most importantly, decent writing let alone casts littered with Actors Studio vets. In recent years we get juvenile junk like this reject.Of course, Hill was one of the producers of Alien that literally launched a thousand space ships, hardly any of them worth watching unless you are one of the IMDb's bottom feeders who thinks Al Bradley and Lewis Coates (their Italian names are equally pointless) knew how to make movies.

There's a certain amount of fun to be had with Alan Smithee movies in a group of friends, possibly more if they're all intoxicated. So when Supernova turned out to be a pretty standard sci-fi adventure movie (though appropriately ridiculous at times), I was disappointed.It's not a good movie, let me make that clear. There is enough meaningless sci-fi babble to fill an entire season of Star Trek Voyager. James Spader looks absurd in a spacesuit - and I mean more than most people do. The jock from Can't Hardly Wait is the bad guy, and also naked about half the time he's on screen for no reason at all. For that matter, just about everybody gets naked in this movie. Why? Because it's allegedly titillating.The entire plot feels recycled, from Spader's bad boy space cadet to the universe-destroying alien artifact his crew picks up along with the mysterious stranger played by the jock. Their ship is a rescue vessel responding to an SOS beacon on some distant moon. Spader is a new crew member of the ship, but the captain is killed en route to the emergency, putting him in charge. Where there was once an entire mining colony, they find only The Jock and his magic rock, which will have a peculiar effect on people who handle it throughout the movie. Lo and behold, The Jock is not all he seems to be and he spends the whole movie trying to seduce the others with promises of money, power, and/or sex, or killing them because he's just not that persuasive. The events in the movie do not carry any weight because we're not given even a chance to like these characters before they get put through the wringer. The characters are here to advance the plot instead of the other way around. It's too bad the plot is made up of several poorly directed action sequences.

At least thats what I'd hoped to do. After trawling through a number of pages worth of reviews the variation in responses to it had me wondering just what I was in for.The general feel of 'Supernova' is that its trying to put some unique twists or angles onto many sci-fi theme's you've probably seen before in other movies. This isn't really a bad thing as just because something has been done before doesn't mean another movie can't create an enjoyable adaptation of it. The problems that I had with this movie though wasn't the story or science or direction, but with the acting and performances.Robin Tunney  Blank vacant expressions is pretty much all you get from this actress through-out all her scenes. Her one emotion of 'shock' seems to have been applied to everything she takes part in. Also there really doesn't seem to be any relevance to her character even being on the ship other then something for Lou Diamond Phillips to get mad at.Lou Diamond Phillips  If Robin encompasses shock then Lou is the on-screen portrayal of frustration. Thats about all he does really, walk around looking frustrated and meagerly acting in a frustrated manner. You really get the feeling he's doing this movie for a pay check and thats about it. Its not as if he didn't get a chance to shine either as there are a few scene's where its just his character interacting with the 'crazy' alien artifact. I would have thought an actor who is interested in his role in a movie might have tried to squeeze a bit more .. well .. anything out of the scene's. But Lou is just sitting there with an expression of almost boredom as he discovers the 9th dimension.For me these two actors create the biggest problem for the movie, as during the whole middle of the film your pretty much just watching these two bumble around the ship. Minor plot holes and bad science I can over-look, but pointless inane characters annoy the heck out of me.OK enough about the negatives, because amazingly this movie did have some great characters positives . Now I'm not exactly a fan of the shows that James Spader's been appearing in over the last few years, but I have to say that enjoyed the role and performance he gave in this movie. Yes it was dry and monotone, but after watching the movie I think the role actually called for it.A classic example of this, and probably the part of the movie that I really enjoyed the most, was when Spader's character was rocketing back to the crippled ship in a tiny rescue vessel exclaiming to the super-human bad guy that 'hes gonna get him'. Peter Facinelli's character had just murdered the greater majority of the crew using super-human strength coupled with 100% confidence .. yet here was a single lowely human returning to the ship and the immortal monster was dead set terrified. Where he had previously and smugly dealt with the crew toe-to-toe, Facinelli's character gave himself lots of distance and even armed himself with a weapon for Spader's arrival. I thought this power game between the two was done quite well, in fact once Spader returned to the ship the movie became far more involved and interesting.Wilson Cruz played a small-ish role in the movie, but unlike Robin and Lou he didn't over or under act it, and out of all the crew seemed to get into the role the most.Angela Bassett was good when Spader was on screen (or in the ship) with her, but once Spader left the ship to visit the surface of the planet Bassett's character became the 'captain by default' and also the 'hero by default' .. but unfortunately neither her character nor her acting was really up to the task. Admitedly this was during the whole 'lets apply science to fiction' part of the movie where they try fill in the story about what the alien artifact is. Unfortunately Bassett's performance was rather un-emotive and here, but in her defense this was when Robin and Lou were wandering around the ship having their subplots play out so there really wasn't a lot to work with either.For me Spader saves the movie, and the sequences where they out smart and out wit the super human Facinelli are done quite well and play out quickly and intelligently. Facinelli's monster was in total control with the other crew, but as soon as the captain returns to the ship the whole level of 'control' is shifted.I can't say this is a classic movie or one that I'd be wanting to watch again and again, but ts definitely NOT unwatchable or terminally flawed. It had a lot of things going for it .. but if only they'd spent more time casting a better crew for the ship.One last thing though, overall the special effects are very good .. but who-ever thought that splicing some 1960's era 'through a microscope' footage of an embryo during the hyperspace sequence was a good idea really needs to be slapped.

And the sound track was right on the money - moving, soaring, eerie, exciting, tender, everything it was supposed to be in a first class movie.It's too bad that the screenplay itself (which started out strongly) got bogged down in a mire of muddled philosophizing, maddening plot holes and inconsistencies and third rate editing.It seems as if the movie needed 15-20 extra minutes of plot development, exposition and dialog to fill in the ambitious goals it sets for itself. Instead it touches on a lot of interesting, potentially intriguing ideas - an alien artifact with Armageddeon-scale potential; a hospital ship on the deep frontier of space; an abandoned mine on a rogue moon; the price and implications of addiction to power and pleasure; the budding romance between Spader and Bassetts' characters; the specter of a super-powered serial killer stalking the ship; an AI coming to full 'wakefulness' as its computer guru plays chess with it. But everything is just set up with a few lines of dialog and never truly explored. Even the murders of the crew members has a very perfunctory 1-2-3 quality about it. The ending, when it comes, seems abrupt and unearned, as the ship's AI blithely reels off a string of exposition that begs for further development and exploration...but instead, the movie just ends.To make things worse, the plot holes are many and grievous. They drag the movie down into sci-fi gibberish. Earlier commentors covered them extremely well, but I'd like to show how some of the extra dialog and exposition I mentioned earlier might have gone a long way toward filling in these holes and lowering the irritation factor. For example Why doesn't the ship have pods for the patients? Because injured or sick patients wouldn't survive the jump even in a life support pod, so the ship stays at its destination and provides long term care until further help arrives. Why was the killer allowed to roam free around the ship? Because Spader still didn't trust his instincts around Karl and erred on the side of trust because of his own drug fueled background. Why didn't Sweetie - programmed never to take a life - try to prevent the murder of the first two crew members? Because the people who programmed her never dreamed of a maniac performing murderous violence on a hospital ship and her parameters weren't set to deal with that event. Why did Karl want to bring a fantastically dangerous device back into human space (if he understood its true nature, he would know it would kill him too, after all)? Because Hazen addiction turned him into a monster of narcissism vulnerable to the lure and metaprogramming of the device's alien makers. Why wasn't there a 'cut off' to allow Captain Marcy to stop the D-Jump until his pod could be repaired? Because the D-Jump, once begun, cannot be halted - the ship has to use the energies unleashed, or be destroyed in the ensuing chain reaction (which is why D-jumps are undertaken only with for missions of great urgency). Why weren't there shields on the ship to protect it from debris in the heavy gravity zone? There were, but the crap flying in space around them was far denser and more dangerous than than a hospital ship (as opposed to a military transport or war ship) was ever meant to encounter, so the shields weren't adequate to the task. See how easy that was? That took me less than five minutes.And yet the director(s) and the final screenwriter(s) couldn't be bothered to do this and the final patchwork product was released in an apparent hope that the pretty pictures and buff bodies on display would help the crippled story escape notice. Sorry, guys, the pretty baubles just made the editing and sloppiness of the second half look even worse.The DVD is a bare bones package, but it does have a nice extra 13 scenes deleted from the final cut, including an alternate ending that is much glummer and gloomier than the 'official' one. A few of these scenes are trivial and inessential (including the alternate opening )- but several of them would have added to the coherence and depth of the film quite nicely.Really, I ought to rate Supernova with a 4 or 5, but the glimpses of a much better, much more worthwhile movie kept popping through in the occasional line of dialog, or shot of deep space, or erotic scene, or bit of art direction. lighting and set design. So I feel like it deserves a 7 because it had so much potential - an possible 8 or 9 hobbled with a 3-4 type production difficulties. When will the studios ever learn?

Facinelli's read nudity is over the top beautiful. Nice to see Rober Forster doing a shirtless scene at his age and looking hot. The girls are hot too, though only above the waist shots.While the movie as a whole kinda stinks, several of the early scenes are good. The early scenes with Spader and Angela Bassett are very fun.After the first 45 minutes are so, however, turn it off. Once you've seen Spader's shirtless medical examination, everyone stripping for the dimensional jump and the jump itself, and Facinelli's nude medical scan, the movie is basically over. Too bad they don't hire writer's in Hollywood much anymore. Just a little creative plot here at the end could have made a world of difference. "},{"Title":"the Force is not strong with this one...

They pick up a survivor and predictably all hell breaks loose.Supernova feels like a mix of Dead Calm and Event Horizon, except of course that those films were good. Supernova doesn't have one single good scene or moment. It's just a tired rehash of other better films, without anything new or exciting. It's not even bad enough to laugh at.The characters are completely uninteresting and given no back story. Just by looking at them you can pretty much tell who will live and who wont. Spader and Basset are the heroes (i.e. they will make it), Forster doesn't do anything except die in the first ten minutes (I guess his role got cut down), Tunney is there to show her breasts, Phillips and Cruz are cannon fodder, and Facinelli is the insane villain (here portrayed by being buff and sweaty).The plot seems to be made up by holes. Actually, trying to make sense of everything that is illogical may be the film's only virtue. Take, for example, the premise of an ambulance ship that doesn't have enough room for it's personnel, let alone any passengers. There are also many things that just end up silly when being on screen - like calling the ship's computer Sweetie (that works real well in a tense situation) or having a robot on board, that looks like a mannequin in an old pilot's outfit.Tryiing to do more intelligent sci-fi films seems to be a tricky thing to pull off (Mission to Mars, Red Planet, and the not-so-intelligent Battlefield Earth all failed). Supernova, with it's nonsensical script and troubled production, is no exception. Shaky, tilted (does anyone think that looks good?) camera work, so-so effects, and cheap looking sets doesn't improve the viewing experience either.

Throughout the film there is a strong undercurrent on the theme of death, birth and renewal in this film. A routine call for help and the crew finds their lives in jeopardy. The rescue team roles including Wilson Cruz seem understated as they appear non-challant about the work they do. Perhaps they could have shown more emotion about being burned to a crisp if they didn't hurry their resue and get out of there. The film reveals the human side of the rescue team and how the human side react to the challenge when they rescue Peter Facinelli. James Spader faces the challenge of being the person in charge when he takes over command of the ship when the captain dies. Angela Bassett has her doubts about him, but keeps a cool head while attending her duties as medical officer and keeping things on track. Robin Tunney has her own doubts about her relationship with Lou Diamond Phillips and realizes too late that she has made a mistake when she listens to the advice of Peter Facinelli whose character fascinates her. If you really wanted to, you could nit-pick this film to death. It does have some rough unexplained edges but overall the film was well worth me watching and the scenes believable.

Angela Bassett, who experienced her ups and downs (worst performance in Critters 4, astounding performances in What's Love Got To Do With It and Strange Days), is also experiencing her last (hopefully) dumb movie role. She has some lines that are completely useless to the development of the plot. Robin Tunney is very unlucky lately. In 1999, she appeared in two movies this one and End of Days. As usual, she is terrible. Someone has to tell her good looks (that includes breasts) do not usually mix with talent.The plot is less than dumb. It starts quietly, 10 minutes pass nothing interesting happens, 20 minutes pass, ooh, we got a distress signal, let's do a jump (which looks incredibly like Star Trek warp travel). Finally something mildly entertaining happens the captain is fused in plastic, let's kill him. Then for 10 more minutes, I yawn. A sexy villain appears, let's see some gratuitous nudity. Carnage starts in the least shocking way. Killer is ejected into space. Didn't we see this before? Oh, yes. In Alien, Aliens, Alien Resurrection, when it was frightening. Finally, the survivours do another jump. They are luckier than the deceased captain they exchange eyes, and Bassett is pregnant. I start laughing.I am sorry if I sound sarcastic, but this movie is an absolute waste of time. I would have given it a big, fat, good-looking zero, but I can't. 1/10 is more than generous.Last comment I also hated Sweetie, the ship's computer. It was the most annoying character that I've heard in a long time. It is supposed to be a machine, not a horny woman who wants to have sex with one of the crewmen. I was wondering, if they used Star Trek's idea of warp travel, maybe they should have used the same computer. It would have been even less original but a bit more believable. "},{"Title":"MAN!

The distance to be covered calls for a space jump that costs Captain Marley his life and leaves rehabilitating military pilot Vanzant in charge. His first duty is to save the ship from falling into a star's heavy gravitational pull, but the damage caused by other space debris has left them badly stuck. The dimension drive they need to get back home will only be fully recharged 11 minutes before the star goes supernova and destroys them. As if things weren't bad enough, they only get worse with the arrival on Nightingale of the only survivor on Titan, Troy Larson, who has brought some strange artifact on-board with him.In the UK anyway, this film drifted around a release date for ages before ending up just pushed out to die. Sometimes this happens to films that are difficult to sell and sometimes this happens because they are poor. With Supernova I was worried that I already knew which one of these two it was, but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. Whether or not the writers story of ten years old had any value or not I cannot comment but after several script rewrites, what we are left with was a messy, nonsensical system that seemed to have a good idea buried deep in its core but was totally betrayed by the delivery of the script and the film as a whole. The film looks good, has plenty of action and has expensive effects but the central narrative is weak and as a result it never held my interest no matter how many things blew up. Without any depth to it, the film ends up as a fairly predictable story that just treads familiar territory before just, well, stopping at the end.The cast struggle to provide character, relationships and depth but none of them manage it. Spader forced such a gruff voice that he had me clearing my throat on his behalf. He is a solid enough lead but that's about that. Bassett is a good actress but those meeting her in this film may not believe it because she doesn't have much to do. Forster's presence was a mystery while Phillips, Tunney and Cruz are only so-so. Facinelli is hardly doing anything special with his character and simply turns in a performance that others have done better. Marshall can do nothing with a poor photocopy of Hal.Overall this is an average film &#150; neither any good or that terrible. It looks good but the narrative is weak and lacking anything of real value. The swapping of directors and rewrites of the script scupper any value that may have existed in the original story and the cast cannot do anything to repair it. The effects and the bangs will make it distracting to some viewers but really it is no better than that.

There is just blood, sex, violence, and pear brandy (one of the more exciting parts of this lame movie!).  As I was watching this movie I concluded that everyone involved was strapped for cash or needed a release for pent up schizophrenia and this was the mutually beneficial vessel used by all.If you prefer to watch a film, and I use that term loosely, that has no plot, pointless love scenes where the characters have as much chemistry as oil and water, and nothing connects or makes sense, this is your movie.

Screenplay, direction, acting (with one exception) all rock-bottom. Robert Forster gave a good, sympathetic performance, but his character was killed off in the first ten minutes.  They should have kept Forster and killed off the rest of the cast.  Worst of all was Angela Bassett, parodying Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character from Star Trek TNG as if she held a personal grudge against that actress.  Bassett has done some creditable work, but she needs direction (more than most actors). She did not get it here.  Robin Tunney is wasted here and her nude scenes (the only reasons one might have for watching this movie) were excised from the US theatrical version to give it a PG rating.)As for the direction, the IMDB listing suggests that there is a question as to who should get the credit.  The answer should be None of the Above. I'll bet that the directors' guild wouldn't allow the producers to use the traditional Alan Smithee because this turkey would besmirch his name. If Coppola was involved in any capacity, it must have been after a battery of wine tastings at his vineyard.The script?  Wherever a hackneyed melodromatic device could be employed, it was.  Where it couldn't, it was bludgeoned in anyway.The script ominously hints that a sequel will be needed in 51 years. Actuarial tables tell me that I will probably not be around that long.

Nice cover art, and and interesting premise.  Unfortunately, it was done by a bunch of brain-dead soap opera writers.  There were many things that were wrong with this movie.  From the beginning, if there is a fault with one of the tubes there should have been failsafe protocols that prevented them from jumping to hyperspace if someone tried to use it knowing full-well what the outcome would be by the end of the jump.The fact that they don't have shields to protect them from debris striking the ship is another.  When they get there and pick up Carl, they let him have free run of the ship.  Since there are no security protocols to keep him out of sensitive areas where only command personnel should have access to, he is able to wreak all sorts of havoc by simply walking in to them. In one of the murder scenes, 'Sweetie' does nothing (other than saying you are overriding standard operating protocols) to stop him from opening that airlock and thus one of the female crew is sucked out into space; yet in another one, she refuses to evacuate the air from the room to suffocate Carl before he has a chance to kill Benjamin.Then we get to the ending which was about as anti-climatic as they could make it!  Heck, the ending to Disney's The Black Hole was much better than this piece of drivel.

And even low scores like a 4/10! Have these people EVER seen a bad movie before?! What kind of grading system, in some people's minds, puts this movie at, or near the bottom of, and WORST of, all movies!1. ADMITTING THE BADDue to the lack of complexity and depth to the story, this film, ultimately, by the end of the movie, DOES FAIL to uplift intellectually, and to open one's mind to new and original ideas. It also FAILS to challenge deeply held sterile social beliefs, or to provide any new insights into the nature of reality, or to entertain the imagination with never-before thought of possibilities, or to take the viewer deep down into the depths of mystery! ... The story, unfortunately, is fairly hum-drum by science-fiction standards, and I was irritated by the employment of the central plot-device, in a science-fiction movie, no less, of yet ANOTHER testosterone-driven, bullying, ego-maniacal, dangerous, power-and-greed driven, unreflective male protagonist who screws things up for everyone around him.Surely, between the stars, there is more happening than what is happening here on Earth, and what can be seen in any mundane drama set in any dysfunctional, patriarchal, family-values household! And, also, I have to agree with so many other reviewers, who couldn't stand all the sex and nudity in space. Sex, nudity, dumb male-violence, testosterone - this is not what I want to see in a science fiction (or any other movie) - I want to be mentally-challenged and to see that which I have never imagined, and to be AMAZED! Unfortunately, story-wise and plot-wise, this movie did not do that for me!2. THE GOODSPECIAL EFFECTS - This movie has EXCELLENT special effects, and the feel of the movie - the decor, the ship, the moon, the blue dwarf star (from which the title Supernova is derived) are beautiful, astral-coloured, far out, and evoke a highly desirable escape-to-the-stars-and-to-freedom visual and psychic experience, that no mundane drama would even attempt - and that is the beauty, and soul's delights, that science fiction offers! So from the very first scenes, based upon the atmosphere of the film, my strong inclination was to give this movie 10 stars!One thing that DID move me beyond anything I have ever seen before in any movie, that was, indeed, complex in terms of plot, imaginative, original, and beautifully enacted by both the actress and actor involved, was the so, soo sad and tragic scene in which the computer, Sweetie (played by Vanessa Marshall) which has been given human characteristics by Benj (played by Wilson Cruz), refuses to break her programming, and as a consequence sees her programmer, who has, in reality, become her friend, die violently, whenupon, now just-become self-aware, she is now only too acutely aware that she has lost her only friend whom she has come to love, forever. That interaction was sublimely beautiful! And for that reason, by reason of that so well-developed, and complex yet innocent relationship; a poetic-interplay of exceptionally well-performed theatre that explores EXISTENTIAL FREEDOM and LOVE LOST, and despite all of the movie's failures to deliver much depth of meaning, I still had to give this movie 8/10 ...(sob!).I also liked the mystery of the nine-dimensional matter device, and I think the mystery and unpredictability of such beyond-imagination, and yet still-scientific language, and such simple magical devices, is a good idea, since it means so much has to take place in the imagination - and the imagination is a whole nest of inter-dimensional portals in itself! Though such devices may resemble each other superficially, there is no way to know what their properties are - and that is why they are always so mysterious, so long as their secrets are not fully known or defined, nor properly understood. Likewise, the device of inter-dimensional travel - which was shown from the very beginning to be unpredictable, mysterious and dangerous!
