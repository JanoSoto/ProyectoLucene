I admit that it is the fourth in the series and that is getting pretty ridiculous but this one has many memorable moments in it.  Also where else can you go see Sharon Stone, David Spade, and a speacial appearance by a young kid at the time named Tony Hawke.  No where else can you get so many people in one of their first movies.  It is also still highly entertaining and causes me to laugh often.  This is where you should stop watching the series however b/c they lose Steve Guttenburg and he is the only reason the series kept on for as long as it did.  So don't give this a low score.  Help it get out of the lowest 100 where other real horrible films belong.

A gaggle of society's goofiest citizens have taken advantage of a new policy to loosen hiring standards at the police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all directions to get them thrown out. They embark on their first assignment, which is to turn around Commandant Lassard's beloved precinct 16, which has been dubbed the worst precinct in the city and given 30 days to turn around or suffer some major employee turnover, a fate which is relentlessly helped along by the eternally butt- kissing Captain Mauser. They display a spectacular feat of water-borne police work, saving the academy and then return in the next movie to beat the city's other police academy when it turns out that the governor decides it's not worth the money to keep them both open.Oh, and of course you all realize who is in this thing, right? None less than Sharon Stone, David Spade in his first film, and Tony Hawk in an early stunt-skateboarding role! You gotta see this!This time, Commandant Lassard has come up with a scheme he calls Citizens on Patrol (C.O.P. Get it? Get it?), in which he elaborates slightly on the plot of the original movie. You see, the police force has been stretched a little too thin and the public has developed a negative opinion of them due to the fact that they can't be everywhere at all times to stop every single crime in the city. So the natural solution, of course, is to train the public as deputy police officers and basically have briefly trained undercover cops all over the city. In fact, so close is the resemblance to the first movie that we are even treated to a couple characters who are forced to join the police academy or face jail time &#x96; an idea suggested, of course, by Mahoney himself. This is the best part of the movie, by the way. There is a hilarious gang of skateboarding punks who are disturbing the peace left and right, headed by none other than David Spade, who is a hardened urban predator if I've ever seen one. Thug life, baby!!Sharon Stone also has a relatively small role in the film, although probably one of the ons that she would like to forget about, and Lieutenant Harris is back after being gone for the last two movies. All of the other relevant cast members return, with the addition of a new group of misfits, like the token fat black guy, David Spade and his idiot skateboarder friend, and Tackleberry's FATHER-in-law. Remember that guy? Who is always gleefully punching out his son? I can't wait until the grandparents start joining!But don't worry, until then we have Mrs. Feldman to hold us over. Here's this sweet old lady living in a nursing home/military barracks and who has more of a love of all things camouflaged than Tackleberry himself. In fact, I was waiting the whole movie for her to tell her that she's his long lost mother, but no such luck. Something went wrong with the screen writing in there somewhere, but ultimately she turns out to be one of the most consistently funny characters in the movie. She's played with a good-natured smile by Billie Bird, who clearly enjoyed herself while making the movie. You can always tell when the actors are having a good time, and it always makes the movie better, which is good because this movie needs a lot of help!Of course, it's not much different than the last three movies as far as being worth watching. Bud and his father are still trading punches and it's still more groan-inducing than laugh- inducing, people are still accidentally wandering into the Blue Oyster Club, which hasn't been funny for three movies by now (Proctor inadvertently wandering in naked was the high point of this gag, but also the point where it becomes the most clear that the joke has lost its steam), and Jones is still doing that Bruce Lee impersonation which was funny in the first movie when I was a kid, but as an adult not so much&#x85; But, Callahan has a great wet t-shirt scene that makes the whole movie worthwhile!Oh, and was Mahoney's mischievous grin ever amusing? That poor guy, man. His reputation has for some reason become so tarnished that he is seen by most of the public as even more of a washed up has-been than, umm, well no one else really comes to mind. Bill Paxton? Nah, he's cool, I think. I never needed to forgive him for Weird Science, but Guttenburg unfortunately has a whole string of bad sequels to make up for, and Cocoon and Short Circuit are just not gonna cut it! At any rate, super-gluing the loudspeaker to Harris' face was funny, but why they missed out on the opportunity to have Harris screaming through it at high volume at the doctors in the hospital I just can't understand. The screenwriters are not scoring many points in this one!But still, this is one of the better Police Academies so far. This one and part 3 are the best ones in the series that I've seen so far, despite the hilarious 1980s badness (there's a boot- legging crime lord, for example, who operates his illegal warehouse standing around with a fistful of cash and a hula hoop around his shoulders), but there definitely are some fun gags. Harris macing his armpits is one is one of the more memorable gags in the whole series, along with Mauser getting his hands glued to his hair, and I have to admit that I enjoyed some of the scenes of the original recruits trying to recruit the public for the new C.O.P. program. It's not a good movie, but it's a good Police Academy movie!

But I still wanted to see them and judge for myself, I loved the first Police Academy, the second and third are cheesy, but they were fun still. Now onto Citizens on Patrol, I honestly liked this film, I know it was cheesy and clich√©, but with G.W. Baily back in his game, you can't go wrong. Again, one of the things that surprised me is that they've been able to get the same cast back over and over again, we also have two of my new favorite characters Zed and Sweetchuck. It was great to have the old gang back together, even if the movie needed a little work, they still made the movie very enjoyable.The Police Academy is given a new assignment, there is a new program called C.O.P., Citizens on Patrol, taking regular people off the streets and turning them into cops. Mahony has taken a few misfit punks off the street and made them join, there's an old lady, there's the average or less then average people in the program as well. But Captain Harris hates this program and will do anything to shut it down, but when there is a jail outbreak, he may just have to rely on the C.O.P. program to help him out.Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrol has it's good laughs here and there. I always love to watch the jokes the gang plays on someone, my favorite this time was how they super glued the mega phone onto Harris's lips. I would recommend this if you are looking for a couple laughs, I think people are bing a little too harsh on these films. They're the Police Academy sequels, they're light hearted and fun, they're meant to just relax and laugh for a bit at the stupid stuff. But I did feel like this is the weakest I have seen so far out of the sequels, it could have had more laughs, but it is worth the watch.5/10 "},{"Title":"Adult gags and Juvenile gags do not mix.","Date":"2 October 2007","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" This is a hard Academy movie to define.

Honestly, I really only have seen the first two in the theatre. The third one I saw on cable TV. Now that I've bought the box set on DVD, I can honestly say that it is at this 4th sequel of the Police Academy films, that they really should have stopped right here. A lot of the humor is predictable and (most annoyingly) often repeated. For example, Winslow (Larvell Jones), was doing his silly karate man humor excessively though many of the Police Academy films. If he only did this in one film, the humorous impact would have been cherished more. The first three Police Academy films are the best. Taking this predictable slapstick into four more follow-up films (with totally forgettable stories, was just a bit too much.) On a positive note, Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrol starred Corinne Bohrer as Laura. What a gorgeous blonde babe she is! And also, I'll have to admit that on the documentaries of the making of the Police Academy films, Leslie Easterbrook is still quite an attractive looking woman. Marian Ramsey still looks good, too.

What nobody knows is that Captain Harris (G. W. Bailey) still harbors a tremendous resentment towards those in the police academy and will stop at nothing to make Commandant Lassard look bad in the eyes of all of his superiors. Now rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this movie wasn't quite as good as the first two films in this series--but it was better than the third. Much of this success can be traced directly back to Bobcat Goldthwait (as Zed) who I thought was extremely funny. On the other hand, there were several scenes which reused the same tired, old scenarios from the first three movies which just weren't very effective the fourth time around. Likewise, in my opinion Sharon Stone (Claire Mattson) was terribly under-utilized while Billie Bird (Mrs. Feldman) was featured much too often. In any case, I have rated the movie accordingly. Slightly below average.

Yep this fourth time around Lassard calls on his most loyal men to train up a group of civvies for his new programme 'citizens on patrol'. Naturally the resident bad guy (this time its back to Harris) doesn't agree with Lassard's plan so he and Proctor are out to foil their plans, so dastardly.The idea behind this isn't too bad really, its a bit like special volunteer officers which we have here in the UK. So the general concept is sound, the problem is we are back at the academy focusing on training these new civvies and we're seeing all the same stuff all over again!!To cut a long story short, seeing as I've explained what happens in the academy for the last three film reviews, we see every character doing their unique thing all over again. This means more martial arts from motor-mouth Jones, Callahan is in the pool getting her huge tits wet, Tackleberry is on the shooting range (where else), Sweetchuck gets thrown around the place a lot, Hightower is on voice commands and Mahoney is lurking around the stereotypical blonde bit of fluff and dishing out his good deed speeches left right n centre.Everything in this film is virtually a replay on everything we've seen in virtually all of the last three films. The last three got away with it because they were more adult and the idea was still reasonably fresh, no longer does this apply. The whole film is very boring and extremely childish, on top of that nothing makes any sense now, its just bits n pieces thrown together.Mahoney, Tackleberry and Hightower perform a very elaborate prank on the three young guys simply to prove they aren't ready for the real beat. This whole sequence is completely nonsense, as if you would go to all that trouble for nothing, its total filler that isn't even amusing. There is a fight sequence on a docked ship against some ninjas (!), no idea why this happens or how the officers end up at the docks but hey. I honestly feel they stuck this in simply to utilize Nogata who cameos here, also another martial arts sequence for Jones who appears out of nowhere. He just pops up for this fight from literately nowhere.Add to that a vast amount of terribly cartoonish visual gags, pratfalls, blatantly obvious stunt doubles, terrible audio dubbing and pretty much no actual main plot (accept for the civvy training crap). There is a jail break midway through which serves as the big finale, this time its in the air with hot air balloons and old biplanes. Now I admit its all performed well with nice aerial stunts and whatnot but its so completely ludicrous. Why on earth would they chase the bad guys in hot air balloons? surely you'd just call in police choppers?? how the hell does everyone seem to be a dab hand at flying biplanes?? why am I even questioning a Police Academy flick? I might add that Hightower completely disappears for the last half of the film, odd, Bubba must have had better things to do.This film is quite 'famous' I suppose for a few things, firstly its one of Sharon Stone's early films as she was slowly getting more recognised. Secondly there is a young Tony Hawks in the film showing his skateboarding skills and thirdly there is also a young David Spade as one of the civvy recruits.This is easily one of the worst PA films in the franchise simply because they reuse every old trick and story sequence idea all over again. Yes I know most of the PA films do this but like I said up to this point in the franchise its been reasonably fresh. This just feels terribly dull, uninspired and has some of the worst comedy I've seen, you can't even call it slapstick, its just sh*t. Goldthwait as Zed is responsible for some of the worst acting, dialog and sequences in this film, not even Bailey as Harris can save this turd.Just to really hammer home the final nail in the coffin, right at the end out of nowhere, Mahoney and Sharon Stone's character are seen floating off together in a customised Police Academy hot air balloon. No explanation about how or where this special balloon came from, its just there, one final silly sequence to really take you out of the moment (if you were in the moment in the first place that is).3/10 "},{"Title":"This sequel lacks steam.","Date":"27 February 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" This is the third sequel to Police Academy, where basically the filmmakers recycle the main plot from Police Academy 3.

Captain Harris (G. W.

There's a role for an attractive young actress by the name of Sharon Stone, the film debut of David Spade, some enjoyable skateboard stuntwork (featuring Tony Hawk) and roles for Brian Backer, Billie Bird, Corinne Bohrer and Randall Tex Cobb, among others.The script is again by Gene Quintano (as this was supposed to be filmed back to back with the third movie before the declining health, and subsequent death, of director Jerry Paris) and Jim Drake gets to sit in the director's chair.There aren't that many big laughs (though one prank involving a portaloo is as funny as it is ridiculous) but things roll along merrily enough and the familiarity of the cast and signposted gags make this an enjoyable and undemanding viewing choice.

The jokes are getting more and more childish and one-dimensional and there are many things and scenes we have already seen in the first three movies. There are no new interesting characters that have been added to the series and especially the young Sharon Stone does a quite disappointing job and even the presence of David Spade and the cameo appearance of the young Tony Hawk don't help in here and are just interesting side notes.But surprisingly the movie still works as we are happy to meet the old and well known characters again and even if most of the scenes and jokes are predictable, they are still funny and have their moments. When Mahoney and Jones capture two killers with some arrogant citizens on patrol, I really laughed out loud and felt entertained. When Proctor and Harris get fooled over and over again, especially in the toilet scene or the microphone scene, the whole thing is funny as usual even though it is nothing innovating or surprising. While the ending of the third movie and the chasing scenes with the boats was rather dumb, the ending of the fourth part with the air planes is really entertaining and quite spectacular.On the other side, there are many scenes that are somewhat overlong, ridiculous and boring for example the first minutes of the movie or the ninja fighting scene on a boat in the end. The entertaining parts are though still in the majority.Anyone who liked the first three movies should also watch this one as the quality only got a little bit lower and as important characters such as Mahoney and Zed are still on board for a very last time and funny as usual. I would suggest to rent this movie and have some fun and finish the series on a higher note. Only the hardcore fans should maybe go further than part four.

Of course our gang gets a group of rejects that they must train into shape. This was the beginning of the end for this series and while there are a few funny scenes the thing still can't keep afloat. The regular cast including Guttenberg, Smith, Winslow, Graf and Easterbrook are back but we've also got G.W. Bailey coming back as Harris, the main villain from the first film. Harris actually steals the film and gives an energized performance but that still isn't saying too much as the screenplay is very weak and basically just recycles jokes from previous films. Even the regulars seem rather tired and bored. Bobcat Goldthwait is back as well but most of his jokes seemed aimed at his bad speech. Heck, we even get a pre-fame Sharon Stone and David Spade but neither add much. The best sequence for me has always been the one where the veterans try to teach the new guys that they aren't ready to be police and take them out on the case of a voodoo man who is actually being played by Smith.

Basically Cmndt. Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) decides the Police Academy is overworked and understaffed, so he comes up with the Civilians On Patrol (COP) program, allowing civilian volunteers to help the police. Obviously ex-graduates Sgt. Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) and old friends, Sgt. Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Sgt. Larvelle Jones (Michael Winslow), Sgt. Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Officer Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait, you may remember him being the bad guy in the 2nd film), Lt. Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Sgt. Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey) and Officer Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky) are in charge of training the new recruits. Capt. Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey) wants Lassard's job, so he is determined to see the COP program fail. Besides that, it seems the main villains are some skateboarding troublemakers, hardly what you'd call evil master criminals, just naughty kids. What surprised me was the appearance of young pre-Total Recall Sharon Stone, as Claire Mattson, a small love interest I guess of Mahoney. Also starring Derek McGrath as Butterworth, Colleen Camp as Mrs. Kirkland-Tackleberry, Home Alone's Billie Bird as Mrs. Lois Feldman, George R. Robertson as Police Commissioner Hurst, The Emperor's David Spade as Kyle and Ace Ventura Pet Detective's Randall 'Tex' Cobb as Zack. Guttenberg hardly has any highlights, well, neither do many of the other regulars, and you could tell Guttenberg wanted to move on to other films, Winslow adds some entertainment with his self-made sound effects, including a rap while some civilians are exercising, but it's very pointless. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Original Song for Let's Go To Heaven In My Car, why wasn't it nominated any others, same for the two previous and just as awful sequels. Poor!

Sadly, it was only going to get worse from here. I've tried no less than three times to sit through Mission To Moscow, and it is just impossible. About the only reason to bother with episodes three through six is so you can see the final episode where Cast Member X decided they'd had enough. Or when Event Number X that was referenced in a sequel took place.Another big problem with PA4 (and boy, there are many) is the change in target audience. Sure, episodes 1 through 3 could be enjoyed by children with two digits in their age, but the primary audience was adults who didn't have very high standards. Unfortunately, someone in the film studio must have decided that the writers have to please everybody, and so they watered down the humour as far as they could without getting a G rating. That, more than anything, is what hurts Police Academy sequels 4 onwards.Steve Guttenberg must have taken one look at the finished product and wondered why he didn't quit about three films ago. Bob Goldthwait picks up the slack in terms of comedy, but his act is also watered down a tad too far, ditching any vocal expression of his character in favour of shouting and screaming at anyone and everyone. Which might work for a comedy about mental patients who have been neglected by the system for too long, but not when your character is meant to be a police officer. But then again, the whole premise is built on a notoriously shaky ground.Every Police Academy film has at least one celebrity (other than George Gaynes) who wishes they had never appeared in the film. Sharon Stone gets her turn her, and despite what they say about her appearance in everything after Basic Instinct, at least she looks capable of acting. But amongst this lot, I'm sure a dead goldfish would appear to be emoting effectively.Overall, PA4 gets a 2 out of ten from me. It stands as a good relic of what happens when you try to appeal to everyone, and it does have some genuinely funny moments, but it just cannot hold a candle to its predecessors, especially the first.

It is, not unexpectedly, a series of barely-connected sketches with very few laughs, leading to the sudden appearance of a vaguely finale-shaped chase sequence.The plot forgets the premise of its own series, revolving as it does around the introduction of a scheme that allows ordinary citizens to join the force. I thought that was the whole point of the original movie, insofar as the original movie had a point? Clearly the comedy opportunities inherent in the character of a gun-mad old lady were too good to pass up. At least G.W Bailey is back, and Bobcat Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinsky are an entertaining double act. If only that were enough.I can see where the movie is trying to be funny, but the writers and director Jim Drake can't stage even a cheap laugh without mucking it up. In one scene Bailey has a megaphone glued to his mouth, which is supposed to be a jolly prank but comes off as mean-spirited. In another, the ever-amiable Lance Kinsey is winched into the air in a portaloo and deposited in a football stadium, where he stands in front of a huge crowd with his pants around his ankles. In some other movie this might get a laugh, but not in this one; there's a lot of set-up for very little reward. Ha ha, that underarm deodorant was actually mace. Hee hee, you've accidentally wandered into a gay bar. On and on, predictable and flat and crude, and not crude in a good way.The surprising highlight is a skateboarding sequence, which is directed with flair and has a few genuinely impressive stunts in it.

Faith in the Police force is low, and crime is high, so a new ploy to solve both dilemmas is introduce-COP-Citizens on Patrol, which sees the police force opening its doors to the everyday citizen, for training and the opportunity to work along side real Cops. The old gang are assigned to the job, and go about trying to find recruits, while Harris and Proctor try to sabotage everything.New recruits include Corrine Bohrer, a vastly under-used actress, who is excellent in the role, and outshines Sharon Stone, who plays a reporter. Bohrer falls for Zed, providing many comedy moments. An old woman who has the same penchant for violence as Tackleberry, Two skateboard punks, and The House, a big guy Hightower used to babysit. When there is a prison break out, it's up to Jones, Mahoney etc, and the COPs to apprehend the bad guys.Many funny moments include- the 'Yumma yumma yumma yumma yuuummma' scene- The underwater biking scene, quickly followed by the Zed calling Harris 'jerk' moment. All the usual antics are back, with each character doing, admittedly the same jokes, but they are used better here than in the other films. The acting is all good, but it is obvious to see why many people hate this.

Lesser years were a bit more conservative, but the eighties produced hoards of stupid little funny movies that were let upon the public and instantly forgotten. But along with the funny ones there were the terrible ones. Police Academy 4 is one of the terrible ones. For that matter, all of the films were horrible ones.The bumbling cops are back. This time they are training a new pack of cadets who have signed on for the C.O.P. (Citizens on Patrol) program, looked over by the naive Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes, once again impersonating Leslie Nielsen to little effect). Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) is still around with his stupid little grin, as well as Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), and Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait). A disguised Richard Harris - er, Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) is determined to make the new C.O.P. program fail...at any costs. So it is up to Mahoney and Company to save the day...once again.I've covered all my problems with the Police Academy series in my previous review. I don't see what there is to criticize here. As a film, Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrol is simply horrendous, the type of movie that should never have been made (or any of the sequels, for that matter. Nor the first film, for all it's worth). This is just another entry into the bumbling series about bumbling cops. The first film was basically a repeat of the underdog formula seen so effectively and more humorously in Stripes and Revenge of the Nerds. Now Police Academy 2 had more potential for the first, because it was more original than the first -- it was actually about cops in their daily routine of combing the streets for trouble. But the film's director, TV veteran Jerry Paris, simply used dumb physical and sight gags that were mixed with horrible sound editing (imagine a man slipping on a banana with a big SSSSSSLIP! and BOING! sound as he falls). This is horrible physical comedy.The sequels past that entry just never should have been. What ground can five sequels (count 'em, five) accomplish that the others have already not? Absolutely nothing. This is a huge cash-in franchise. The only problem is, I don't see what there was to cash in on -- was anybody interested in Police Academy at all after the second one? By the low ratings the films have achieved over the years, apparently -- and rightly -- not.Perhaps the only thing that Police Academy 4 has accomplished, or can be remotely respected for, is setting up both Tony Hawk and David Spade's careers. Yes, that is correct -- Hawk and Spade are in this film. They play two skateboarders in the beginning of the film. It's amazing to think that some low-grade agent out there was watching this sorry little film -- probably to see if the bad hype was all it was worked up to be -- saw them, and also saw stars. This movie, in one way or another, pushed them forward into the showbiz spotlight -- Hawk with skateboarding (he was slightly famous among fellow skateboarders at the time, having won some competitions), Spade with acting. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is one bizarre fact of life.The big question may be this Is Police Academy 4 worth sitting through just to see how bad it is? No way. It's not even unintentionally funny in a sort of Hercules in New York kinda way. This is just a bad movie, no matter which way you slice and dice it. It's almost painful to sit through. Scenes just appear and disappear and jokes just fling about at us, one after another, with no comic effect whatsoever.Whatever respect the outrageously unfunny Steve Guttenberg may have achieved with such outings as Diner and/or Cocoon are simply wasted in these films. Even Steve Guttenberg didn't return for the fifth film in this franchise. And so I suppose this fact proves that the talentless hack has an ounce of sense in him afterall.One of the film's tagline is, On land, on sea, or in the air, no place is safe from them! And you know what? I wonder if that tagline was meant to be humorous.Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrol is rated PG for Please God make it stop.0.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer "}{"Title":"This had a lot of potential","Date":"19 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Police Academy 4 Citizens on Patrol isn't a bad film; it's just uneven and underdeveloped.

That move is the main source of the problems here, but it's also the main source of a mostly untapped potential for a great film.The idea is that Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) is initiating a program to train citizens in basic police skills and procedures, so that they can help crack down on crime. As just a trivial example of how Police Academy 4 is underdeveloped, the program is Citizens on Patrol, so that the acronym is C.O.P.--you can't get a much thinner pun than that.Of course, there are bigger problems. Quintano and Drake fill some of their time with 1980s trends--like a long skateboarding scene (featuring a very young David Spade and skateboarding by a just as young Tony Hawk). There's some good skateboarding there, but it doesn't exactly fit a Police Academy film. Much of the first hour is filled with jokes based around core Police Academy characters' personalities, as in the previous three films, but whereas the material was fresh if underdeveloped in Police Academy 1, quick-witted and breakneck-paced in Police Academy 2, and more sequentially gag-oriented and slightly hit and miss in Police Academy 3, here it is too often a bit flat and stale. There are some funny bits, of course, but in light of the multilayered quick delivery and nonstop gags of some previous films, settling in as a rehashing underachiever on this end isn't going to entail success.Mixed in with this standard material is the introduction of the C.O.P. program and its characters. Many of the new characters are good, but Drake is comfortable to let the film be a slow cooker, far too slow for where he eventually goes with it. While it's slow cooking, he treats the C.O.P. characters as an expanded core Police Academy cast--which is okay, because they all have their quirks just like Mahoney, Hightower, Tackleberry et al do, and those need to be established.But here's the problem. In the final 20 &#150; 30 minutes of the film, Drake does something very different for a Police Academy film and clever for this plot. He breaks the settings wide open, sets all his characters in chaotic motion, and achieves a madcap misadventure feel ala It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963). What a great idea! But why did it take almost an hour to get there in a film that's just over 80 minutes long? The C.O.P. program and the new characters should have been introduced in 20 &#150; 25 minutes tops, and the madcap misadventure stuff should have been developed far more so that it built momentum over the next 70 or 80 minutes. That would have made this an excellent film instead of a cursorily enjoyable one, because the last 25 minutes are good, with quite a few flashes of greatness.

All of the sequels to the first Police Academy were just that... sequels. But, the fourth one is the top of the heap as far as I'm concerned. The range of characters brought in were hilarious. Plus, Sharon Stone, David Spade, Tony Hawk... who could ask for more?The additions to the cast in this one breathed some minor life into the franchise and (unfortunately) opened the door for more sequels (ouch).But, if you like to laugh, this one is guaranteed to make you chuckle. The scene where Tackleberry goes over for dinner with the family of his girlfriend is so funny I almost lost my lunch.

Leslie Nielson always plays a funny part in Police Academy movies. Something for you to watch when you need to laugh. Sometimeslaughing so hard you are crying. Its been a while since I have seen it.  But I still watch it when it comes on reruns.  My children have the tape and if I saw it on DVD I would probably buy it. I would advise watching this movie with your teenage children.DianeWatts "},{"Title":"Steve Guttenberg's Last in the Series","Date":"2 August 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Police Academy 4 is another tiring entry in the long-running series.

I think its been dragged down because of the fact it is from 1987 and seems dated like anything else from the 80's that was not mega budget like ET, and also it had the misfortune to produce a number 7 seven years later. It is significant as it is the last to feature Gutenberg and Goldthwait who went off to make those horrid movies, the one with the horse afterwards. It is also very funny, Captain Harris has prank after prank played on him by Mahoney who he bumps into the first time since the first one (The one that most people actually liked). When the microphone gets glued to his face is too funny to be true. And then theres the Madullah/Freddie Kruger scene with hightower going yama yama because hes hungry!!! There are even a few gimmicks between Sweetchucks and Bobcat that will make you laugh at the end and the balloon scenes are classic filmed in the scenic backdrop of an Ontario October afternoon. Hightower and Hooks also provide some laughs especially where helium is placed in the canister so Harris sounds squeakier than here after abusing her for her voice. All in all the best comedy of the 80's after Ruthless People. 8 out of 10, hint hint people.

I remember seeing this in the theater when I was 9 and I just rented it recently (I'm now 22) and laughed my ass off.  The idiotic antics of Lt. Proctor (I wonder where he is now?) are what makes the movie so great.  I loved the scene where he is dropped off in an exposed porta-pot into a stadium and he rises for the national anthem with his pants down. Or the scene where the new recruits are standing at attention and Capt. Harris catches David Spade chewing gum and says I hope that wasn't bubble gum and then Proctor sees Spade blowing a bubble and says It's definately gum sir...bubble gum...cherry I think.  If you like this kind of inanity then you will love Police Academy 4.  I still can't get the opening song (Citizens on Patrol) out of my head.
