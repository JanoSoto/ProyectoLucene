[{"Title":"3/10 **/5 ~ Beloved Bug Bites Bottom.","Date":"5 April 2004","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" This third and last theatrical sequel to the classic Walt Disney Production The Love Bug (1969) brought the enormously successful franchise about a magical Volkswagen to a screeching halt. Herbie deserved a better send-off.There's just no love left in the poor little disrespected cash-car. Filmed on the cheap in Mexico, this entry has none of the quality and charm of its original and trashes all that was good about the preceding sequels. Vincent McEveety, the weakest of Disney's three main directors during this period, was assigned the project after having done a fair job with Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, but makes no effort to elevate the project above the level of its poor script. The frenetic, maudlin result is one of the worst Disney films. Talented comic performers Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and Charles Martin Smith are wasted on unfunny material. Only the clever stunt and effects work save this mechanical destruction derby from oblivion.The Love Bug was eventually revived for a brief TV series and made-for-TV movie, but Disney was flogging a dead V-Dub.

Having a child as the nominal lead in an essentially adult role is a surprisingly common motif in children's movies; surprisingly, because more often than not it fails to work and it certainly fails here.  Eight-year old taxi drivers?  I think not, not even in Mexico. Our Paco is more annoying than lovable and I found myself rooting for the villains instead.Clearly the writers are to blame for the mess - the cast is actually quite good, e.g. you cannot ask for much better villains than John Vernon, Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel, but they were fighting a loosing battle against a rotten script. The best asset of the film is Harvey Korman who shows the right spirit, and is given the freedom to act out his madcap humour.  Neither his routines nor his character fit very well into the story, but the story is so weak one does not care.

It can be argued that this is the weakest in the series as far as plot, characters, and Herbie himself are concerned. The title is one of the major problems of the films. Bananna's were used in only a minute spot on the film. A better title probably would have been Herbie Stinks in This Film. The thinly thought-out plot, if you can call it that, has no real direction and it's not clearly explained. You had to look really hard to tell what was going on and why. Characters are another major problem with this film. Panco was little more than a prop to hold up the story; he was at best a pain and of no real help to the film. The other characters were awful - they could have been used much better than they really were. The same goes for the crooks, too. Unfortunately, Herbie doesn't add a whole lot to the film either. Compared to his other films, there's barely any slapstick commedy and he doesn't really help anybody else out in this film, unlike his other ones. Herbie definitely wore out his welcome mat here in this film. The other three are a much better alternative to this film.

Rework the walk the plank into some other way to get the bug to it's destination. There are some very comical parts in this movie. Leachman and Martin Smith put character into the movie. The rest were along for the ride and you knew it. The villains were more smart and ruthless in this episode than others. However there were some real stupid moves that disagreed with this notion. The scene with the plane and the heavy gold disk was an insult to everyone's intelligence. Great care should be used to leave magic and mystery where expected (Herbie and Coincidence)but not go beyond the laws of physics in other parts of the production. Large gold objects rolling around inside a small aircraft will destroy it very quickly. Not much racing in this one either.

Had the movie ended with Herbie being dumped into the ocean by the maniacal captain this movie would have had some redeeming quality. My kids actually asked me to take this move off because it was completely lacking in any entertainment quality. Disney should have followed this movie up with HERBIE GOES TO THE CRUSHER. The only saving grace this movie had was Harvey Korman as the insane captain of the ocean liner. Sorry I subjected my family to this sad ending to an otherwise fun and endearing movie series.

A lot of things were left out of this movie that made the 1st 3 so enjoyable, not just Dean Jones. I was a little surprised that he wasn't around, since his character makes a mega-comeback in Monte Carlo, but if he was in this film it'd be a black mark on his record. Jim Douglas has retired, & leaves Herbie to his nephew Pete. He & his friend Davey doubt it'll win a race, so just plan to return home w/it. When they see how fast it can go, they change their minds & decide to race in Mexico - but get delayed 50 times. Paco, a native pickpocket who swipes their & a smuggler's wallets, is invited by Herbie to hide in the trunk. He's taken along on the ship that'll get them all to the race - but is caught. The stupid pirate-obsessed captain accuses Pete & Davy of kidnapping, & when Herbie tries to rescue Paco, he orders Herbie to be thrown overboard. After landing and escaping once more, Paco finds Herbie - & runs into the smugglers, who inform him that the wallet he returned is empty. Now he steals Pete's wallet which really belongs to the thieves, & is forced to escape both by fleeing w/Herbie, the captain, & a few women Pete & Davey befriend on the boat, to stop the smugglers from stealing goods. The bull-fight they get into along the way's a highlight in the movie - partly because there's not much else to look forward to. Herbie's name was never used; the only name he gets is ocho from Paco. He can't swim - it's pretty clear he's lost that ability over time; in Love Bug he skates right over water, in Rides Again he sinks before floating like a human, here he drops like a rock & barely survives. The men pretend to like the women they meet on the ship, but it's just to get support in the race, & there's no sign that they've been forgiven. Nobody except Paco & Louise (1 of the women), had no idea until near the end that they were dealing w/a car that had brains or power. It isn't proved by a race either - for all the trouble they go through to enter him in a race, it isn't shown. I don't understand why he helps Paco the thief, even if he is loving. The title confuses me - it's a reference to Herbie's being covered w/bananas as a disguise, but that was 5 minutes at the most. He was also dressed as a taxi w/signs all over - but that didn't amuse me. The only thing that could've made this more disloyal to the series was if they'd excluded the car Herbie. I was so bored w/this I forgot the plot & characters. A good example of a bad sequel.

This was playing on Turner Classic Movies channel yesterday and I still can't figure out how it got on there in the first place. Certainly not a classic but the exact opposite -total bomb. Even the title is stupid,the car goes bananas in every movie it's in however there is a scene in which Herbie is covered in bananas but it takes place near the end of the movie and lasts about 5 minutes. The plot involves a very irritating young Mexican boy ,bumbling crooks, a desperate pathetic Helen Roper type love starved slut played by Cloris Leachman and her niece, a goofy ships captain and two young typical guys who want to race the car. The young Mexican boy befriends Herbie who by the way never gets called Herbie except for one time in the beginning of the movie. The cars number is 53 so of course in Spanish 53 always means 5+3 ,stupid. Now we have the very irritating boy yelling ocho(Spanish for 8 at least 200 times in the movie). Come on ocho , ocho ocho. Good god I wanted to sew his lips shut. They race around the world on cruise ships and through ghetto South America , with Cloris Leachman trying to get into Harvey Korman's pants in these stupid subplot scenes which have nothing to do with the main plot of the movie and this is a Disney flick?. It gets even worse, why do some people think the bull fighting scene is funny etc, it's very stupid with the car holding a cape in its hood and driving around backwards with the bull chasing it ,meanwhile the people inside yell and scream and the kid yells toro ocho toro ocho ,, how can i keep watching. The kid also plays taxi driver and becomes the race car driver too , oh sure yeah ,disney was on something for this movie- most kids i watched it with when i was young were probably bored. In the end , a very bad irritating finale to the series. Harvey Korman is wasted in a role so beneath him its sick, he is like a stupid Captain Stubing love boat style with the worst most unfunny dialog(the writers should have been shot for the preschool humor), the rest of the cast chews scenery and the stupid horny Cloris Leachman overacting every time she looks Kormans way as if she thinks Korman would want anything to do with her gross come-ons. I've never liked her in anything shes been in, shes a terrible actress, how she won awards who knows. After the final scene ,we get treated to a very syrupy irritating ending song about friendship complete with a Spanish word thrown in every few verses like i bet you a banana mañana ,charro, amigo etc. Is this Spanglish? Oh and did i mention the above bananas are also sold by the kid to passersby, yeah id like to buy bananas that were touching a smelly rusty car and the fact they drove 600 miles in the hot sun with the bananas on the outside of the car. these little sub-scenes added no doubt to amuse small children and annoy parents. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to turn your kids into numb minded dregs. Of course this may keep your 3 y/o amused for ten minutes while you run to the video store to shoot the owners for carrying this movie.

No racing, no Dean Jones, and no quality movie. I thought there should have been a story where Douglas and Applegate continue on their racing quest to a country like Germany or Italy. These writers probably thought that the racing idea was too tiring to be used anymore. I did read on some site that Dean Jones did read the actual script for the Bananas movie. He said no because of the story's new twist itself. I can't blame him for that. Even if he was in that storyline, the movie might have been a bit better but still the worse. If the movie was about racing again, then Jones returns but probably not as good as Monte Carlo. Instead, new story with new characters that made no sense. Therefore, this is where the movie went wrong. This is also where the movie had the twist of fate.

I'm 27 and don't usually like fairytale type stories much anymore, but I find Herbie goes Bananas to be a lot of fun and usually very enjoyable. Some things about it are rather ridiculous, like a kid driver and other items, but after all, it's a fantasy movie just like all the other Herbie films for that matter. Some parts don't exactly fit together or make sense, like how Herbie knows where Paco is when he's left behind in the jungle, why Herbie would be let up into the Pannama Canal, and other things. But if you just forget about the parts that wouldn't work in real life and enjoy the story and events that take place it's a lot of fun. Of the now 5 main Herbie movies, The Love Bug, Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, Herbie Goes Bananas, and Herbie Fully Loaded, this isn't my favorite one, but it's not my least favorite either. Personally my favorite is probably Herbie goes to Monte Carlo, and my least favorite is definitely Herbie Fully Loaded. I admit that when I first saw it there were plenty of things that didn't seem right, but after seeing it a few times and getting used to it I got to really liking it. Some things I found to be a bit unpleasant, confusing and sort of mixed up. I didn't like it that Herbie rusts in the water and nearly drowns, but after all this isn't the first time Herbie is damaged and later fixed. Sometimes it's confusing all the different items going on at once. I do think it could have been better with perhaps a few less characters. There are plenty of things that could have been better, I wouldn't argue with that at all, and it is considerably different from the other movies. But after watching it a few times and getting the feel for it I learned to really like it. I think it just takes some getting used to, the more I watch it the more I enjoy it. One of the only things that I never like is the rude, selfish and annoying behavior of the pirate like Captain Blythe.Many parts I find to be very funny, especially the scene that the movie is named after, where Herbie is throwing Banana's at the crooks near the end. Maybe it's just my opinion, but I find this to be hilarious. However I don't think the movie title should have been named after this.Anyways, I think it's a great movie once you get used to it. Some parts could have been better, but I find it to be just as good as the other Herbie movies.

So Pete and engineer Davy Johns collect the car to enter it into a race, but they first have to contend with little pickpocket Paco. Despite the look of the car, they take it on the cruise ship with them when they leave &#150; not knowing that Paco has sneaked onboard as well to escape the wrath of one of his victims who are part of a gang planning to steal Aztec gold.This was supposedly the final entry in the series but I suppose that the new 2005 film means that it is number 4 of 5 (so far). The characters and locations have all changed but essentially the formula is still the same &#150; physical comedy from Herbie, romance from the driver, a crime subplot although no race as such. In this regard it doesn't do anything particularly special or go anywhere other than you expect it to, but it is inoffensive and not annoying or boring. The comedy is so-so, with plenty of Herbie action for kids (apparently they went through over 20 cars making this) and acceptable humour for adults.The cast are mixed &#150; in some regards they carry the movie but in others they are terrible. The lead cast are mostly poor. Burns shows how enjoyable Jones was because he is totally lacking in charisma or screen presence. Smith does his best to impersonate the usual engineer sidekick (Knotts) by mugging and pulling faces but it never gets past the stage of impersonation to become his own work. Davalos is terribly dull, although her wooden, uninspired delivery does quite compliment Burns. Garay (the third, would you believe) is OK but if you hate cute kids in movies then you'll hate his squeaky little performance; however I suppose it is quite cool that the car gets to act opposite an orphan &#150; very like Chaplin. Thank goodness for the support cast then, because they do a lot of the work that the lead actors fail to do; not saying that they are that good but at least they are lively and interesting. Korman overacts with little material to work with but he is very funny at times. Leachman is a lot more by-the-numbers and not as interesting. The criminal gang don't have much to do but the faces will be interesting for adults &#150; Jaeckel and Rocco for example.Overall, this is a fairly obvious entry in the series but it is still enjoyable. The overuse of the kid will put many adults off because it brings out some horrible, cloying sentiment but mostly the film is lively and quite enjoyable. Children will enjoy it and adults will be able to watch it without feeling bored.

It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who enjoy cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps carried out by Herbie . In the sequence where Herbie walks the plank, a real Volkswagen Beetle was cast out into the sea , however it was never recovered. Herbie The Love Bug was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white. Under normal circumstances, the interior would be a matching white. However, Herbie's interior was painted a special non-reflective grey color so the camera and studio lights would not reflect . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Charles Martin Smith and Harvey Korman as a silly captain play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by John Vernon , Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel are top notch . Colorful cinematography by Frank Phillips , being the only classic Herbie film to not be shot at the Golden Oak Ranch. Jolly soundtrack by Frank De val , Robert Aldrich's usual , including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , the original entry was ¨The love bug¨ by Robert Stevenson with Dean Jones , David Tomlinson and Buddy Hackett , followed by ¨ Herbie rides again (1974)¨ also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry , Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes ; it's followed by ¨Herbie goes to Montecarlo¨ with Dean Jones , Don Knotts and Julie Sommers ; followed by ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others and a 1997-for-television-movie with Bruce Campbell and John Hanna and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This first version  Love Bug ¨ results to be the best version , it is amusing story with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture was professionally directed by Vincent MacEveety . He's an usual craftsman from Disney productions and a filmmaker of several TV episodes such as ¨Diagnosis Murder , Colombo , Pensacola , Airwolf , Dallas , Cimarron , Star Trek , Gunsmoke¨ and many others . This ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ is an amusing and engaging film with effective combination of primitive special effects , live action , adventure , fantasy and humor .

They're from a more innocent era, a time when cars having a soul didn't seem such a far-fetched idea because of the amount of acid you were dropping. Hating Herbie films is like hating a six-year-old for not being able to do algebra. But I had my fears that Herbie films would run out of gas in subsequent films but this one, this wretchedly boring addition to the series, is running on fumes. Devoid of any of the charm, humour and speed of any of the previous three films, it's a tragic way to close a series that had, at least, been fun up till now.Herbie's new owner this time is square-jawed American Pete (Stephen W Burns) and his mechanic buddy DJ (Charles Martin Smith) who inherit the car in Mexico. After befriending streetwise pickpocket Paco (Joaquin Garay, III), they decide to head to Rio De Janeiro to participate in the Brazilian Grand Prix. Boarding a cruise-liner to Rio, they meet eccentric Aunt Louise (Cloris Leachman) who intends to match up Pete with her shy and bookish (but incredibly good-looking) niece Melissa (Elyssa Davalos) while keeping her eye firmly on Captain Blythe (Harvey Korman). Amid all this, Paco is being hunted by a couple of villains from Mexico (John Vernon & Alex Rocco) who are after some lost Inca treasure and pretty soon, Herbie decides to intervene in the only way he knows how...Given that the plot is hopelessly muddled (we don't even find out how they get on in Brazil by the time the film ends!), Herbie Goes Bananas is a prime example of what happens when a film has only a couple of decent ideas behind it but runs out of steam very quickly and struggles to fill out its running time. Very little ever seems to happen and when it does, it's so mind-numbingly dull that it never recovers your full attention. Herbie himself lacks the personality of previous movies, being little more than a car that does tricks such as the scarcely-believable matador scene. Combine that with possibly the most annoying kid I think I've ever seen in a film (and I'm included Shortround from Temple Of Doom) and it's no wonder you're not interested. Throughout most of the film, Herbie's called Ocho and one of the characters is so stupid, he can't work out why. For a film principally about a car with a mind of its own, it's ironic that there is no drive in the movie at all - nothing feels exciting, dynamic or amusing which is something the three earlier films managed at some point. Even the actors looks bored although Korman hams it up somewhat as the caricature naval officer.In truth, there was no reason to make this movie other than for Disney to flog a dead horse even more and wring the last few dollars out of a dying franchise. Even the weakest sequel up to this point - Herbie Rides Again - had one or two moments that were worth watching but this has none. But what could they have done that hadn't been done before? The only thing that's different in this movie is the location, offering the film-makers a whole bunch of dodgy accents and racial stereotypes to plunder in the search for some family-friendly laughs. Alas, they have come back empty-handed. This is the film that ushered Herbie into the pits for the last time (although Disney still put out a couple of half-hearted sequels later and even a TV show) and frankly, this film is very much like its star - out of date, rusty all over and in serious need of scrapping.

The major mistake of this film was coming after the 3 older Herbie's films, which sealed its doom from the very start. Had it been made before them and maybe things would have been different, it probably would have been more successful and appreciated. But then we wouldn't have Joaquin Garay III in it. Back when the 1st Herbie film 'The Love Bug' came out (1968), Joaquin Garay III was just coming to our world. Without taking off merit to other kids, I don't know if this movie would have been so good without Joaquin Garay III. He cheers me up so much in this movie.This film is so unique and feels so different from the previous ones that it's more than just another sequel. I think of it almost as one that doesn't belong to the same family of movies.This movie is a jewel. I dare to say it's worth gold. They don't make them like this anymore. Now there are a few minor flaws but otherwise there is lots to like it's delightful, charming, timeless, entertaining, nostalgic and the way the story is told is funny. There are lots of moments of great fun, but really funny humor (classic humor) and absolutely no dirty humor.Concerning the soundtrack, the only song I find nothing special is Look at me. Aside that, I adore the cheer song I found a new friend and the cheer music with no singing played at the opening credits and other parts.The locations are a major appeal beautiful, desirable and exotic destinations like Mexico and Panama, perfect for some unforgettable Summer vacations and even better if it's in a voyage by cruise ship.Harvey Korman portrays the pirate maniac Captain Blythe - crazy but funny at the same time. The actors who play the bad guys are pretty good either. Stephen W. Burns makes a very convincing Pete Stancheck.Joaquin Garay III is excellent in his overactive performance as cute little Paco and his chemistry with Herbie is perfect. There's something special about this unusual friendship between this lovable but mischievous little boy and the world's most charismatic Volkswagen Beetle. The way how Paco and Herbie communicate with each other is funny and reminds me of Pete's Dragon because we can't understand the dragon's language but the boy does and continues talking to him normally as if it's no big deal to understand. The same happens to Herbie and Paco.Herbie is called Ocho by Paco because he doesn't know the car's real name and misunderstands the meaning of the number 53. Apparently he interprets them as separate numbers, possibly because of that line in the middle of the car's hood, which results in one number at each side. What he does is plain and simple he adds both numbers et voilà!A very appropriate movie for children, with everything they can wish in a movie and no inappropriate stuff for them. It's a shame that children of this generation do not appreciate this kind of movies so beloved by children of my generation. Despite being very childish, it's also very appropriate for adults, as long they appreciate good old classics and have no qualms with this one in particular.Title in Portugal 'As Novas Diabruras de Herbie'.

The charm of the original movie had ebbed away over the course of the previous sequels and here the fun runs out completely within the first half hour, leaving us with a flat film that should have been called, according to my younger self, 'Herbie Hardly Does Anything'.The emphasis is on a plot concerning a bunch of smugglers and a street kid, which isn't particularly engaging, and it all gets increasingly tiresome the longer the movie goes on. It is in every way a typical live action Disney movie, and as such is pretty threadbare stuff. "},{"Title":"Poor Herbie","Date":"7 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Vincent McEveety directed this fourth entry that sees Pete(played by Stephen W. Burns) and D.J.(played by Charles Martin Smith) gain temporary possession of Herbie from Jim Douglas, and have plans to enter it in a Rio De Janeiro car race, but need financial backing, so enlist two women(played by Cloris Leachman & Elyssa Davalos) to help out, but get sidetracked by a crazy ship captain(played by Harvey Korman) who dumps Herbie into the sea(!) and then is rescued by an orphaned pickpocket, and pursued by a smuggling syndicate. Awful film is utterly unfunny, contrived, and pointless, not to mention stupid. Forgettable sequel, best forgotten, though a brief TV series followed. "}{"Title":"Ocho","Date":"9 October 2010","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" It was thought the Herbie phenomenon had finally run its course with Herbie Goes Bananas. It turned out only that the franchise just took a quarter century hiatus.In this film Herbie has been given over to Stephen W. Burns and his mechanic Charles Martin Smith by previous owner whom we all know was Dean Jones. Of course he did it without telling nephew Burns or Smith about Herbie's capabilities. A bit of time with him and they really do believe that he can win the Grand Prix at Rio.But before that the little bug gets involved with some counterfeiters played by John Vernon, Richard Jaeckel, and Alex Rocco, a little boy who calls him OCHO played by Joaquin Garay, and the pretentious captain of a cruise ship in Harvey Korman who has the best performance in the film. Burns gets himself involved in a shipboard romance with Elyssa Davalos who is accompanied by her chaperon aunt Cloris Leachman. Korman and Leachman get a little something going themselves though what she sees in him is beyond me. Maybe she just likes the uniform.Herbie Goes Bananas has some nice location cinematography in the Panama Canal, Tijuana, and Guadalajara in Mexico. And it has two good scenes with Herbie walking the plank as per Captain Korman's orders and later on in a corrida facing a bull with Leachman and Korman inside. The rest of the time it moves at a snail's pace, odd for a Volkswagen that's supposed to win Grand Prix events.By the way little Joaquin Garay calls him Ocho because he adds the five and three painted on Herbie's side and that's eight in Spanish. So why didn't he just call him Cincuenta Y Tres?

It appears that the suits at Disney knew Herbie was due for the parts yard, and spent as little as possible to churn this out, hoping to make a quick buck off the few people who would see it on name recognition alone.  Make the kids watch something else.    "},{"Title":"The only Herbie movie I really like","Date":"7 March 2008","Score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Herbie Goes Bananas is way too underrated. Quite honestly, I don't see any reason why so many people dislike it. It's a light-hearted comedy in the old-fashioned Disney style, great fun and cute. It's a harmless movie, without violence or bad stuff. I know I'm in minority, but I consider this a classic.Despite being one of the sequels, this one can be considered a movie apart. It is original and different from the 3 previous movies. It's not a rip-off, which is a benefit. Plus, unlike the other movies (which are dated), this one has that timeless, nostalgic feeling. The movie is much better than its cheesy title suggests.Herbie Goes Bananas takes us to exotic locations such as Mexico and Panama, but also to a cruise ship (the Sun Princess), a bullfight, Inca ruins, Panama's Canal...Soundtrack is nice. I found a new friend is a very charming and cheerful song and I also like the instrumental musics.About the characters, I generally like them. My favorite is Paco, along with Herbie. Paco is cute and lovable, but also comical and one of the nicest and smartest movie kids ever. He always keeps his cheery disposition. He is polite, cool, he really likes his car friend (Herbie) and he always says the car looks good (even rusty). He is so much different from the obnoxious Maggie Peyton from Herbie Fully Loaded or even Jim Douglas himself in the beginning of The Love Bug.Captain Blythe is *very* surly yet hilarious. Imagine having an explosive captain like that aboard a ship...Herbie, the lovable VW Beetle, is a charismatic car in the world of cinema, while the VW Beetle itself is a legend in car industry. I love how he's always there for Paco when he needs help and that Paco does the same for Herbie. I just love their friendship.The bad guys are likable for villains. They always remain calm and delicate without showing signs of aggressiveness.Joaquin Garay III steals the show. His performance as Paco is just so energetic, so lively and terrific. He must have had great fun making this movie. Other talents include Stephen W. Burns, Charles Martin Smith, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, John Vernon, Richard Jaeckel, Alex Rocco and Vito Scotti.It's really cute that Paco calls Herbie Ocho (eight in Spanish) because he believes Herbie's 53 number means 5+3=8. The way Paco and Herbie communicate with each other is so cute. Not less cute is to see Paco acting like a taxi driver (Herbie is disguised as a taxi later) and the painting smiling flowers with the word taxi which Paco paints on Herbie. Curiously, Herbie's name is never mentioned in the movie, except one single time by the garage owner.One of the most hilarious parts of the film is Herbie as a matador. The entire sequence is just so funny! Also, the part when Herbie throws bananas to the bad guys is just hilarious! But there are plenty of other moments as funny as these, of course...This should definitely be on Top 250.

Loads of laughs, loads of fun! The cast is top notch. The effects are superbly done. It is absolutely perfect for family viewing. Great for the kids and still a lot of fun for the adults.There is a perfect blend of aspects that will appeal to the children while not forgetting about the adults who will no doubt have to watch it along with the kids. The adult humor references will safely fly right over the heads of the youthful viewers. If you like Herbie, and who doesn't?, this is one you'll want to see if you haven't already!A truly enjoyable film.

"},{"Title":"The Better of the Herbie Movies Since 'The Love Bug'!","Date":"13 November 2002","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS        America's favorite VW Beetle is back for a final fling in Herbie Goes Bananas! Set in lovely Mexico, friends Pete Stanchek and Davie Johns arrive to enter in a race. Pete's uncle is Jim Douglas from The Love Bug. The car Pete and Davie would be driving is sent ahead the car, of course, was Herbie. Pete and Davie don't think much of it until he takes them for a fast spin! A little boy, Paco, tries to buddy up with these guys. He's actually a little pickpocket! Hey, the kid's got no family and no place to live. Can you blame him? He steals some photo negatives from two bad guys, Prindle and Quinn. The negatives reveal crucial information to the heist they're planning.         While Davie and Pete aren't looking, Paco climbs into Herbie's trunk and when the car is loaded onboard the ship, Paco comes along. The ship is under the command of surly Captain Blythe. Pete and Davie meet Aunt Louise and her niece, Melissa Drake. Pete falls in love with her and Louise offered to sponsor them in the race. Meanwhile, Paco was discovered and locked up. Luckily it was Herbie to the rescue. Paco called him Ocho (eight in Spanish). Why ocho? Because the number 53 is on Herbie's front and 5 and 3 equal 8. Everybody knows that. Anyway, Paco and Herbie literally crash Captain Blythe's party. He commanded that Herbie be thrown into the ocean, and he was. Paco was sad to see his friend go. The ship soon docks; Paco finds Herbie and has him brought on shore. Though full of water, weary and very rusty, Herbie started up and he and Paco took off. Paco turns Herbie into a taxi. But then, Prindle and Quinn arrive. Prindle told Paco to get him the negatives or he'd cut up Herbie.          Pete, Davie and Melissa decide to find Herbie so Melissa buys a clanking old bus and they head off. Paco's first passengers are Aunt Louise and Captain Blythe! The captain despises the ride while Louise loves it. They crash a bull flight and Louise and Captain depart. They hitch a ride with the friends on the bus which immediately breaks down. The bad guys snatch Paco and Herbie and the gang chase after him. They find Paco and shortly after, we see why the title of this movie is Herbie Goes Bananas. They cover him in bananas to get past the guards. Herbie and Paco throw bananas at the bad guys and have them land in the hands of the police. Our story has a happy ending.        A pretty good movie. The Love Bug had a total of three sequels. Herbie Rides Again wasn't too good. Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, where Dean Jones returns, was O.K. but Herbie Goes Bananas was the best of the sequels. It stars Cloris Leachman, Charles Martin Smith, Stephen Burns (who's no longer with us), John Vernon, and Harvey Korman! The kid was cute too. In conclusion, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Disney's clever car, check it out! "},{"Title":"Trivia","Date":"6 August 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" I have another trivia for this title as the kid never mention the name of Herbie on the movie and he calls Herbie ocho, it is because ocho means eight in Spanish which is the result of Herbie's number (53) added (5+3=8)...) that's my theory I don't know if it's true but it has sense...or what do you think??, i figured it out because my mother language is Spanish and my second is English, i didn't figure out when i was a kid because i didn't speak English at the time, i saw the movie like a month ago and it kept me thinking about this. By the way i bought some Herbie's movies in DVD and the quality is great, thanks Disney for bringing back the classics of my childhood. "}]
