The entire cast was laugh out loud funny, from Dave Chapelle as the jive talkin' disco cabbie to Martha Plimpton's howl of a distraught party hostess. Paul Rudd was exceptionally great as Kevin the dumpee who is all grouchy and depressed, and so was Angela Featherstone as Caitlyn the poser. Ben Affleck was good as the bartender, mainly because he didn't talk much. Brother Casey was very cute as a punk/roadie who befriends the two underage partyers played by Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman. Courtney Love was really good as Lucy. I always love Jeaneane Garafalo and she didn't disappoint here as Ellie. I really didn't get why Guillermo Diaz got more exposure, like on the DVD cover art, than characters who were much more memorable, like Hillary played by Catherine Kellner (hilariously ditzy), Bridget, played by the very pretty and funny Nicole Parker, and the lousy lover Scotsman Eric, played by Brian McCardie. Jay Mohr and Kate Hudson were also very lovable as Jack and Cindy. Lots of good music by the Commodores, the Cars, Bow Wow Wow, Blondie, Rick James and many more. A great film to revisit the outrageous Reagan era!!!

The film itself is fairly incoherent in places, with many storylines running at the one time. I thought Kate Hudson was fantastic in her first main role, and Paul Rudd was good as always. Gaby Hoffman probably put in the most irritating performance of her career to date, while Ben Affleck didnt really have much to do. The story itself is pretty simplistic, focusing on new years eve where a bunch of people are slowly making their way to a party hosted by Martha Plimpton's character. Only a few of the characters have any real depth to them, with many just skimming the surface, thus remaining shallow like most of the dialogue in the film. There are some scenes that work, others that don't - a real hit and miss - if you like the actors in it- then watch it- if you don't, then stay well clear.

They are either shallow/vapid people or one-track minds desperate to score before the last hours of the old year ring out; both types can be sketched with a few confident strokes! for instance, just listening in on the bathroom conversation of Caitlin and Bridget you get all the insight into their character that you need to know perfectly well where they come from and what is their motivation; come on, given the lightweight subject matter I don't see how you can expect a 162-minute English patient-calibre backstory; you might ask then why waste time on a movie about shallow people or people obsessed with hosting the perfect party? because shallow plus zero self-awareness plus NYC art-scene types equals funny; being so caught up in party dip and New Year's decoration that it leads up to existential drama and queasiness is also hilarious in my book; and 200 cigarettes serves up just that sort of delightful cinematic entertainment; not to mention that it has one of my all-time favorite one-liners I DARE you to f*** me!

I did not waste my time after all!The story takes place on New Year's Eve 1981 and incorporates 3 storylines into one. All the characters are tied together in one way or another and the movie centralizes around the New Year's Eve party and a woman's apartment (which no one shows up at until she's drunk and passed out).This tale of sex, booze, and cigarettes showed the ridiculousness of these things and made us laugh at the same time. Despite the party being the central theme of the movie...we do not get to see it at all. This leaves a lot to the imagination. The movie was shot so that it alternated between characters and storylines but intertwined them beautifully. Every member of the star studded cast put in a great performance and this movie was truly well done. I enjoyed it very much and give it a 9 out of 10.

The movie has whole slew of great comedians -- Paul Rudd as Kevin, the depressed and readily available friend of happy-go-lucky Lucy (Courtney Love) who goes out of her way to cheer up her friend after being dumped by long-time girlfriend, Ellie (Janeane Garafolo), the artsy fartsy type. Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone) Bridget search out dates after dumping Scotsman Eric following news that her lumberjack boyfriend was suddenly discovered alive and well. Dave Chepelle plays the raddest cab driver as he tries to get his passengers to just ease up, toke up, and go nuts...because it's New Years.But no one is funnier than Martha Plimpton, who plays the paranoid host of the party, and the two party hopefuls played by Christina Ricci and Gabby Hoffman, who wander as far as the notorious Avenue B to find Val's cousin's party. Unfortunately, the night is accompanied by top 40s 80s music, but it doesn't matter. The situations in the movie are so hilarious, it sure it a funky movie.

A completely pointless mishmash of scenes  thrown into a blender and randomly edited together, this movie  had no real plot.  Rather, there are several mostly unrelated subplots about various characters having trouble trying to  decide whom to have sex with.  This sort of plotless movie can  be made to work, given deep, complex characters that can  interact in interesting and unexpected ways.  However, 200 Cigarettes doesn't even come close to providing interesting  characters -- indeed, there are no characters at all in this  movie. There are merely caricatures, which run the gamut from merely annoying to despicable to downright offensive.  The actors are only there to quip poorly written one-liners, perform  some very unfunny slapstick humor, and chain-smoke every second  throughout the entire movie (in order to justify the movie's name, which otherwise has nothing at all to do with the events  onscreen).One has to wonder what the filmmakers were thinking.  Did they  care that what they were turning out was so completely without redeeming quality?  Was there, perhaps, a good movie here, left  on the cutting room floor?  There is certainly no way to infer  this from the film as released.  Was it filmed simply to provide  good clips for the trailers, to sucker people into actually  thinking there is some reason to see it?Regardless, 200 Cigarettes is actually painful to sit through.  The dialogue is atrocious.  The acting certainly matches, with  some of the worst fake accents recorded on film in recent years, courtesy of Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman.  The movie is  totally aimless and dull when it's not being actively offensive.  Those who don't fall asleep during the film will certainly be  counting the seconds until it ends.

Most all cinema, both in and out of Hollywood, is brought to us by upper-class white males, complete with their beliefs, morals, what have you.  One would argue, then, that even if a film came from someone who was not an upper-class white male would still have to work within that system, probably even being influenced by it, in order to get a film made.Note, then, that this film was written by a woman, and directed by a woman.  The characters in it are not testoserone-driven or in any way the pumped-up dumbed-down characters we have seen in recent decades.  They are sensitive, but open to communication, a little irrational at times, but still human.  They are characters from the female mind, a female psychology, and have very feminine ways in interacting with each other.Then note that is was probably marketed by the same male-dominated Hollywood.This is, of course, mostly backed up with the amount of psychology classes I have taken, but the simple version is that when this movie was new, I discussed it with many of my friends.  All of the men either had no desire to see it, or hated it.  Every single one of the women thought it was excellent.Granted, this is a common rationale used by people who think themselves movie critics, but just you try seeing with a member of the opposite sex, and see how your opinions differ.This is the first movie of a New Hollywood, tho it will certainly not be remmebered as such.

For a film that attempts to define a decade, through loud colors, live-in-the-moment party music, and wild costumes, this film doesn't do much more than showcase characters that bitch and moan better than they could ever party. At times, the film acts as that one sadsack guest that is the biggest pessimist of the entire party and the only thing harder than getting him to leave is trying to cheer him up.Normally, this wouldn't be such an issue. Party films that focus on drama and character issues are fairly common, and the issues can often raise viable discussion pieces for an audience or can at least be understood enough to be believed. Not in the case of 200 Cigarettes; it's as if these characters are miserable by choice and nothing, not even a glittery night of carelessness could cheer them up. When characters are barricaded by poor circumstance is when I can feel sympathy for them. When they just seem miserable for the sake of being miserable is when I simply can't.It also doesn't help that the characters personalities are very narrow and even the likes of Paul Rudd, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Christina Ricci, Dave Chappelle, Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Mohr, and Guillermo Diaz can't bring much to their characters outside of their own vacuous stereotypes. On occasion, you'll hear the characters provide us with some decent conversations or some interesting twists, but for the most part, the film is firmly confined in its thin characterization, seemingly unaware that a party film may as well be shot from innocent passersby if you don't provide any humanization, especially when many actors here possess sizable names.Keeping the film on its feet is a terrific soundtrack of hits true to the time period and excessive costume and set design, showing the eighties was all about color, expressive loudness, and everything from drugs to decorations done in excess. The color of the film and its soundtrack are the main things that kept me connected to the film, as its characters could only find ways to disconnect from me.At times 200 Cigarettes is carefree enough to like in its lax, wholly unpretentious behavior. At other times, it's as dull as a single-man New Year's Eve partied defined by a tall bottle of Martini and Rossi champagne and a pack of cigarettes. The only memory I'll likely sustain from it is Ben Affleck's character reciting one of the best lines of his career, saying this to two young, attractive women at a bar, how do you like your eggs in the morning, scrambled or fertilized?Starring Christina Ricci, Paul Rudd, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Dave Chappelle, Guillermo Diaz, Angela Featherstone, Janeane Garofalo, Gaby Hoffmann, Kate Hudson, Courtney Love, Jay Mohr, Nicole Ari Parker, and Martha Plimpton.

It is very much a predecessor of films like Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve where there are multiple stories going on at once that all eventually intersect and mesh.Acting/Casting 6* - The cast is full of some big names (Ben Affleck, Paul Rudd, Courtney Love, Cristina Ricci, Casey Affleck, Dave Chappelle, Jay Mohr)and they all play their roles well. No one does a stand out job, but I will admit Paul Rudd is great at being downright aggravating.Directing/Cinematography/Technical 5.5* - For a dialogue driven comedy it is fairly entertaining, but I don't think it is extremely funny by any means. The film comes together well, but in my opinion never really has a tremendous climax.Plot/Characters 5* - This is nothing more than a movie that follows multiple characters through their New Year's Eve and the adventures or miseries that the night takes them on. Again, it is marginally entertaining, but nothing special unless this is your thing.Entertainment Value 5* - Unless you love one of the cast or are really into how people cope with their personal issues, then you will likely get bored with this movie at some point.

There's a party, and seemingly everyone is invited. Story lines inter-mingle with one another as fate twists and turns for a colorful assortment of characters on their way to the party. Humiliation, depression, sexual inadequacy, selfishness and love &#x96; all fodder for 200 Cigarettes. There's a lot going on in 200 Cigarettes with countless story lines to accommodate its extensive cast. Everyone from Ben Affleck to Janeane Garofalo and Dave Chappelle to Christina Ricci shows up for this party and many memorable characters are molded. A still-on-the-cusp-of-fame Dave Chappelle sticks out the most as the smooth talking, marijuana-smoking cabbie who seems to know all the right things to say. Paul Rudd mopes around in a typically self-loathing character, but is actually likable in one of his most over-looked roles. Martha Plimpton &#x96; as the hostess of said party &#x96; plays a nut-job with sincerity, while Ben Affleck&#x85;well, Ben Affleck isn't given much to do, and you're bound to have a few laughs at his character's expense. Director Risa Bramon Garcia's only film to date captures the party atmosphere and its era perfectly, as the film is fun and truly feels like stepping into a timewarp. This is pure fluff, but there's nothing wrong with that. Anyone willing to get lost in some 80's nostalgia and who can appreciate a young and talented cast will enjoy a drag off of 200 Cigarettes.

It's kind of in the category of, After Hours, Scavanger Hunt and Clue. I laughed quite a lot through it.

I saw the movie in 2003 for the first time and I was really surprised at the cast! Ben Affleck? Kate Hudson? Christina Ricci?! Kate Hudson was too cute and I loved the scene with her and Jay in the restaurant, the Indian group playing in the background was hilarious. The soundtrack was excellent. The songs fit right along with the story line and enhanced it. From the comments I had read so far, not everyone has the sense of humor needed for a movie like this. I have seen the movie about 5 times since and still enjoy it. Not everyone I have shown this movie to enjoyed it as much. But then Mad Magazine was one of my favorites growing up. Loved it!

A group of everyday people in New York City are looking for love and/or lust to ring in the new year of 1982.  This is the foundation for 200 Cigarettes.Directed by Risa Bramon Garcia from a script by Shana Larsen (who seems to have watched one too many Friends episodes), at best 200 Cigarettes never rises above being a non-threatening diversion for 101 minutes.  At worst, 200 Cigarettes sports a group of flat characters and pulls all the usual movie tricks to make us feel like we have been transported back to 1981, such as a non-stop soundtrack of the usual period music and bright, multi-colored clothes.  Being a native New Yorker/Long Islander and 18 years old at the time this movie is set in, I felt no nostalgia at all.  I saw a group of young actors running around pretending it was 1981, going through the usual motions of finding their true loves by the time they hit the big party in the last act.  But all is not lost.  Christina Ricci as Val from Ronkonkama (a Long Island town) is hilarious.  Her accent and mannerisams are dead on as is the relationship she has with her friend Stephie (Gabby Hoffman).  Their conversations about being stranded in the City and unable to find Val's cousins house (where a big party is going to take place) are the high points in an otherwise standard relationship comedy film.    200 Cigarettes could have easily taken place on New Years Eve 1999 with no impact to the story.  The direction and much of the writing is uninspired.  Most of the characters never rise much above TV sitcom level, making it hard to care for any one of them as we are never given the chance to really get to know them.  Overall, 200 Cigarettes comes straight from the Brain-In-Neutral Department.

I respect the film's concept  follow the paths of a number of small groups of people  and bring them all together in the end.  This is nothing that we haven't seen before, and something that is on the screen even as this film is in release (see 'Playing By Heart').  However, using, the technique, each of these talented actors can only be on screen for a limited amount of time.  The films tries to pitch all of these characters as co-leads, something that it _does_ nearly accomplish.  However, this plan is not to the benefit of the film.  Those characters who get more screen time are diminished by the characters who get less, causing a lack of character development for the more dominant roles.  The characters who get less screen time don't get developed at all.  A better strategy would have been to revolve around a purely dominant character group and somehow make an attempt to slowly blend in the supporting roles.

It's really about people trying to get to a New Years Eve party at Monica's (Martha Plimpton) house that no one really wants to go to, including the host.   I don't even want to go there.It starts out with Lucy (Courtney Love) and Kevin (Paul Rudd) in a cab and they seem to be cheerful singing along with some crappy disco song, but then here comes the whining. Kevin's girlfriend broke up with him the night before and he's depressed.  He rambles on and on, in a really annoying Paul Reiser/Richard Lewis way, about how he hates New Year's Eve and it's my birthday.   Waaaaaaa. Then  Monica complains that no one is going to show up or the losers are going to be at her party. Waaaa.

Full of outrageous (and yes, sometimes sickening) slapstick, it's set in a NYC yet unaware of the price to be paid for a lifestyle full of booze, sex and drugs. The cast is uniformally excellent in its depiction of obnoxious people desperate to make intimate connections, yet unable (or unwilling) to deal with the consequences. Special mention must go to Martha Plimpton who plays the hostess with the leastest of the party. The soundtrack is also wonderful. The only negative I had with this film was the nagging feeling that something must have been changed at the last minute regarding Ben Affleck's character. The trailers for this movie had a very funny line where his character is trying to explain that no, I'm not gay...everyone makes that mistake...and there are several references throughout the film in this same vein (he keeps cruising Paul Rudd's character, he tries a little to hard to act straight, his haircut and clothes resemble the gay clone look of yuppie gays in the early '80's). I'm wondering if the movie ended in a slightly different manner originally and maybe did not test well?

"},{"Title":"200 Cigarettes is as tasteless as a mixture of water and wine","Date":"6 March 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  When I was a kid, at certain important occasions where people drank wine my mother would serve me 1/3 of wine with 2/3 of water poured on top.  Though this initiation to adulthood excited me at first, I quickly grew weary of it, because it tasted neither as good as wine nor soft drink.  I had, therefore, decided to switch back to my regular glass of coke in these occasions.  Today even though I prefer wine to any soft drink, if any one told me that I had to choose between a soft drink and the mixture of water and wine, I would probably choose the former.  `200 Cigarettes' seems to me like the mixture of water and wine that I have never been able to enjoy.  I have a feeling that this is due to the fact that `200 Cigarettes' tries to target an audience anywhere between the ages of 13 to 30.  While I certainly do not advocate `art for the sake of art', and I still think that films should be made with the purpose of communicating a story to viewers, I believe that targeting a specific audience eventually leads a film to lose the universal quality of its story.  In the case of `200 Cigarettes' it is even worse because targeting such a diverse audience leads it to lose any meaningful content.`200 Cigarettes' follows several characters as they each deal with their emotional/sexual problems, before attending the same 1981 New Years party. To start with I do not understand why this story could not have taken place in any other period.  The only thing I can guess is that the film intends to appeal to people my age who may be nostalgic of the 1980s as well as the younger generation that may find that period, disco and punk particularly cool.  The only good thing that can come from such a marketing scheme is that I will not have to feel embarrassed anymore when I show my younger friends my CD collection dating back from the 1980s.  This is however the least important problem `200 Cigarettes' runs into.`200 Cigarettes' never attains an internal consistency.  This is due to two main factors related to the fact that it tries to please everyone.  The characters deal with emotional issues that are more common in people in their mid and late 20s.  However, the dialogues seem to be written for an audience that has the intellectual and emotional maturity that `200 Cigarettes' attributes to teen-agers.  The result is that `200 Cigarettes' only tackles the surface of the problems and never investigates the deeper more interesting layers of the characters.  This leads to very poor acting because the actors themselves, and I cannot blame them, do not seem convinced by their lines and characters.In terms of directing the style goes back and forth from slapstick comedy to simpler character study.  This often leads to missed cues in editing.  Each shot is either held a few seconds too short or too long than it should, underplaying any comic or dramatic effect it intended to convey.This is as tasteless as the mixture of water and wine that my mother used to make me drink.  And I believe that it undermines the intelligence and maturity of both adult and younger viewers.  Having tasted wine, I know that `200 Cigarettes' is not the genuine thing.  I am certain that younger viewers will not be fooled into thinking that they have been drinking wine. This brings me to my last point.  I have nothing against films made for younger viewers.  But I believe that they should be done not by targeting a specific audience but by finding a genuine story that concerns adolescents. The perfect example is `The Breakfast Club' which dealt with the issue of discovering one's own identity by breaking all the stereotypes that one is put into in high school.  The `Breakfast Club' may be soft drink and not wine but its appeal is more universal than `200 Cigarettes'.  Ten years later I still have chills whenever I listen to Simple Minds' `Don't you (forget about me)' and remember the characters leave detention in defiance of authority.

The cast is great, with each character fully developed and likeable. The major storyline of course centers around a group of teens and twentysomethings on the streets of New York on New Year's Eve, 1981. The connection between these stories and characters is a party to which each of them are going. Of the cast, several people score in their roles Martha Plimpton plays Monica, the girl throwing the party, who grows steadily more anxious as the night goes on and no one shows up, with perfect hysterics; Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffmann are hilarious as Val and Stephie, two suburban teens who find more than they bargain for in the big city; Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is ditzy but sweet Cindy; Dave Chappelle is a scene stealing Disco Cabbie, who is eternally stuck in the '70's; Janeane Garofalo is Ellie, and she is basically still perfect as the Queen of Wry Wit (These matches are disappointing me!); and Courtney Love and Paul Rudd are perfect as best friends. The rest of the cast does just as well as a whole, but none of the performances stand out individually. The movie on the whole is great, with awesome tunes and a great setting and an overall sense of fun. I highly recommend it; it is even better than She's All That.

True the film got about, oh , five in, but some great lines would have just made the film.  Everything else about the film would have fit in perfectly.  If the comic moments were genuinely funny or the sentimental moments genuinely profound or the confrontations genuinely biting (as it is, the best dig is that a guy is bad in bed, which is a nice plot line, but a really clever insult there would have been bliss) . . . and all it would have taken was a few more good lines.

I didn't laugh at any of the jokes (at first), and despite the fact that the theater was crowded to the walls with raucous teenagers, no one else did either.

I was having flashbacks with the walking boots only scene with Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman. I was impressed with Christina's act, but not to the point of drooling. The strongest characters in this film are Nicole Parker's Bridget and Ben Affleck's nameless bartender. Nicole always adds something to a picture and few can argue Ben Affleck's comedic appeal (ask Kevin Smyth). Not surprisingly these two have a connection at a particular point which is both gratifying and makes you go,See, that's what should have happened.

I realize that the point of the film was to portray this guy in an detestable fashion, but I just wasn't enjoying myself when he was onscreen. Does he ever play someone you can like? No. Incidently, Paul Rudd gives a tongue in cheek performance that includes a few sexual dares (in lieu of Courtney Love's comings on), which gives this film an edge (more of one, then); an intangible, I guess. I don't want to go through everyone, but I've never liked Janeane Garofalo and I realize some truly love her but her presence in this movie is a bit forced.

Instead, it is a hilarious trip through the lives of many characters all with a common end.The movie focuses mainly on the characters played by Courtney Love and Paul Rudd, but even their parts would be hard to call starring roles in the classical sense.  The biggest strength is this very shying from having a lone or pair of central characters, for it is this that allows it to be a movie about New Year's Eve, not about the holiday's effect on a given person.Full of amazing performances by everyone involved (especially Courtney Love who, I thought, would play roles like in Larry Flynt forever), this film is 100 minutes of sheer fun.  Also narrated in a sense by Dave Chappelle's hilarious taxi driver, a seemingly random film comes to a neat conclusion with everyone getting what they deserve.

"},{"Title":"A film about self discovery on New Years Ever","Date":"22 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" 200 Cigarettes is described as an episodic film. It follows around a number of people on New Years Eve of 1981 and climaxes at one huge party. These people seem to miss each other, yet also go through their own problems to try and understand themselves and their part in life. Some of them realise the truth about themselves, while others of them simply continue to go on as they were. To really understand the movie we have to look at the characters, some of them individually, while others together. The first two are a couple of friends, yet in a way a lot more. The movie opens with them in the disco cab (more on this later) and the cynic is simply whining about how his girlfriend left him and that New Years Eve always sucks because it is also his birthday and as such the expectation is doubly high. These two form a major focus of the relationship aspect of the film as they both try to understand what the whole purpose of it is. One simply feels that he cannot hold down a girlfriend because he changes for her only to have her turn against him. The other simply does not care and will sleep with any man she can. It is then that her eyes are opened in a sexual encounter with the guy in a toilet cubicle. She realises that the way she treats sex is really meaningless and that making it a cheap thrill destroys the whole purpose of it. He, on the other hand, has realised that the one girl that is good for him is the girl that knows him. The problem he faces is that the girls he dates really don't know him that well, and as such they end up leaving him after they decide they do not like him. On the other hand, she has been a friend of his for a while and they can both say that they know each other. As such it is inevitable that they end up together. The next couple are a couple of girls who simply want to get laid and end up fighting other the guys that they are with. They dump Eric, the Irish artist, because they decide that he is no good in bed. They then travel the city trying to find dates for the night, but cannot. The only time they find somebody is a single bartender, who they ditch because he is a yuppie. It is when they are told that they way they are behaving will destroy their friendship. To them, having dates should not be important but rather they should focus on their friendship. They end up getting dates, but remain secretive about it because they realise that to do otherwise will undermine their friendship. Eric is a rather pitiable guy as he also can never seem to hold down a girlfriend, but this time it is because he is no good in bed. He is one of the first at Monica's house, the place where they are having the party, and tries to come to terms with what he learns from Monica. His realisation at the end of the movie is that he is bad in bed, and there is really little that he can do about it. Monica is frantic because she is organising a New Years Eve party, even though she hates parties, and finds that nobody turns up. When Eric does, they talk and try to come to terms with their inadequacies, but when her friend arrives, she takes Eric away leaving Monica alone again. Monica is simply very tense and this tenseness means that she drinks so much that she passes out and ends up missing out on the party that she so really wanted to experience. Jack is an interesting character because he believes that he is curse. It appears to be a sweet individual and the girl that he is out with lost her virginity to him the night before. At first it seems that these two are the perfect couple, but this is soon destroyed when we learn that Jack has more than one girlfriend. So we discover that Jack is simply a sleaze who does not want girls attached to him. After his current girlfriend admits that she loves him, he tells her that he is cursed because he simply cannot stop girls from falling in love with him. To this she retorts that he really doesn't understand his fortune for there are many people who spend their entire lives looking for a woman to fall in love with them while Jack simply takes it for granted. He does not grow, for in the end he is still annoyed when Rita throws herself upon him proclaiming her undying love for him. What we know that he doesn't, is that Rita is actually quite fickle. This is the essence of the movie relationships and the failure to relate to people. This is basically what everybody struggles with in the movie, and by the end some have overcome their struggles, while others are still simply blind to their problems. Jack and Dave are the two that are blind to their faults while Eric is left a broken man when the truth of his sexual inadequacy hits home. He is left with a problem that is simply not as easily solved as the rest. I guess the reason here is that relationships cannot be based on sex, and Eric uses sex as a crutch to support his inadequacy in relating to people, while Jack simply refuses to form a deep relationship and Dave is oblivious to everything. The Cynic throws away his cigarettes symbolising his realisation that he no longer needs a crutch to relate to anybody, while Eric, Dave, and Jack are left with their crutches and are not able to let go of them.

Ugh.One good thing the soundtrack!

There is not a great deal of plot other than an account of how a group of young people spend New Year's Eve in New York. The one linking thread is that most of them are on their way to a party being given by a mutual acquaintance named Monica, although we do not see much of the actual party itself. For most of the film, in fact, the neurotic, self-pitying Monica worries that none of her friends will actually turn up- even her best friend Hilary leaves- and that she will be forced to spend the entire evening arguing about her sex life with her equally self-pitying ex-boyfriend Eric, a Scottish artist who specialises in multicoloured close-ups of the female genitalia.A number of reviewers have wondered why it was necessary to set the film in the early eighties rather than the late nineties when it was made, speculating that this may have been a device to market a nostalgic soundtrack album. Certainly, we get to hear a lot of songs from the era by artists such as Blondie, Roxy Music, Kim Carnes and Elvis Costello (who makes a brief cameo appearance)- all of which took me straight back to my own college days- although I suspect that the real reason for choosing 1981/2 was that this represented the end of the carefree, pre-AIDS era.If the film has been set in, say, 1998/9 all the bed-hopping and partner-swapping that goes on would seem a lot less innocent. This is very much a film about sex. Some of the characters are looking for love, but most of them are just looking for sex. Most of them end up with a partner, although not always the one they started the film with. Monica dumped Eric because she found him inadequate in bed, but now worries that she will be unable to find another boyfriend. Val, Monica's young country cousin from Long Island, throws herself at every man she can find, overcome by the excitement of being in the big city. Lucy, a girl even more man-hungry than Val, tries to get off with a handsome young bartender and her (hitherto platonic) flatmate Kevin, who is depressed over the failure of his own relationship. Cindy, a naive and innocent girl, has just lost her virginity to the handsome but obnoxiously conceited Jack, a young man who complains that every girl who goes to bed with him falls in love with him. (He sees that as a major problem).Cindy, in fact, is one of the few attractive characters in the film. She is terminally clumsy and accident-prone (in one of the film's grosser moments she manages to slip over and land in a pile of dog-dirt), but there is at least a certain sincerity and sweetness about the way Kate Hudson plays her. (Justice is done when Cindy ends up with sensitive punk rocker Tom, about the only likable male character on view). Most of the other characters are an unlikeable bunch, whose main vices are self-centredness, arrogance, reckless promiscuity and an even more reckless tobacco addiction. (The early eighties may have been pre-AIDS but they were certainly not pre-lung cancer). The title presumably refers to the number of cigarettes the characters smoke between them. Is this some sort of product placement for Big Tobacco? The film has certain similarities with Barry Levinson's Diner, another nostalgic film (in that case made in the eighties about the fifties) about a group of young friends in the period leading up to New Year. Both films are episodic in character and concentrate on character rather than action. Diner, however, is by far the better film, the main reason being that the characters in that film emerge as rounded individuals, whereas the characters in 200 Cigarettes are little more than one-dimensional ciphers. Diner concentrated on only half a dozen characters; the scriptwriter of 200 Cigarettes made the mistake of trying to interest us in nearly twenty in a film lasting just over an hour and a half. There are really no stars of this film, just a long list of big-name actors in cameo roles.The film's other main weakness is that, although it is meant to be a comedy, the script is not really witty. The running dog-dirt-on-the-back-of- someone's-coat joke may be gross, but it is about the only memorable joke in the film, even if it is memorable for the wrong reasons. It must say something about a scriptwriter's lack of imagination when you are forced to include that corny old gag how do you like your eggs done in the morning, scrambled or fertilised? in your list of Memorable Quotes. The words scraping the bottom of the barrel come to mind. 5/10, chiefly for the music.

Fueled by the pressure of ringing in the New Year, each character strives to connect with the opposite sex and their desperate, uniquely separate, quests are hilarious.Martha Plimpton gives a fantastic performance as the party hostess who is anything but grace under pressure; Courtney Love is touching, sassy, completely believable; Casey Affleck is wonderful handling the tender side of his character; Brian McCardie delivers a funny wonderful performance as he declares his righteous anger at the way women lie.I really enjoyed the way the writer weaves together this colorful quirky cast of character, intertwining them so that their paths criss cross, yet with enough twists and turns so that it's not predictable when finally all their worlds collide at the New Year's Eve party.

The screenplay was definitely up in smoke. And to waste the talents of talented actors- Christina Ricci, Paul Rudd, Ben Affleck, and Courtney Love was like a throwing away a good stogie to smoke. 200 cigarettes is definitely a film for the no looking section. ** Needs Improvement  "},{"Title":"Is an amazing movie","Date":"16 February 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This movie is amazing because it is an excellent parodia on New Years Eve.

I have recently developed some sort of a craving for Indie movies. Christina Ricci is gorgeous and one of the only good things about Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Her co stars include Jay Mohr(Paulie), Gaby Hoffman(Strike), Ben Affleck(Chasing Amy), Casey Affleck(Good Will Hunting), Paul Rudd, Courteney Love(Basquait) and Dave Chappelle(Bulworth). The story is twisted and involving, and the characters are interesting and three dimensional. During the film you realise that everyone gets to know everyone and most of them travel in this cab owned by Con Air bad boy Dave Chappelle, who knows more than he lets on. The best characters are Ricci, the Afflecks, Mohr, Chappelle, Love and Rudd. The others are quite boring. This film sounds similar to Go(although I haven't seen it), because of the involving characters and twisting storyline. Ben Affleck once said in an interview with Neon magazine that he did this film to add a more famous name to the cast. I suppose without him, the film would lose some credibility. 200 Cigarettes is not hilarious-it wasn't meant to be. Its meant to the same dark humour that Dead Man's Curve had. You laugh at the loser, white trash characters, not the jokes. The performances of some of the stars could have been better, but no film is perfect. The film does achieve some of its aims-Love is sexy(I dare you to f**k me), Chappelle is funny, Ricci is annoying and Jannae Garafola provides a provocative cameo-ish performance. For a night of Beer and silly movies, don't miss 200 Cigarettes. Rating=4/5 "},{"Title":"This movie sucks!  Sucks!

Why should anyone care about losers who are 10 years behind in their intellectual development? The film engages on a wild dance between several groups of characters, each more dimwitted than the last, as they try to seek out some big in people's party. We all know that we find ourselves by getting bombed on New Year's Eve, don't we? Every single character is a familiar Dumb and Dumber stereotype, and the pseudo-philosophical speeches they deliver fit these stooges about as well as The Gettysburg Address would fit being recited by Michael Jackson. The cornball link for the disparate group of random fools is that they're all chain smoking nerds. Inspired? Thought provoking? Maybe you'll be thinking about what you'll do after the film is mercifully over; that's about it.Nobody achieves anything useful, and the story just plods along until you have an epilogue sequence on New Year's morning, most of the characters waking up in strange beds, and realizing that they learned nothing from all of this.

I recommend they go back to finish their high school degrees.  Based on the maturity level of this script, surely these people are barely into puberty.  The only thing missing from this movie, to make it a true music video, is strategic product placement and gyrating naked women.  A quintessential MTV production, it is a vacuous and borderline moronic paean to the youthful pursuit of coupling. As an aside, I note that the cinematic chroniclers of modern history seem to think that each decade is defined by its obsession with having sex.  The 50's were apparently all about innocent sex.  The 60's were about free love/sex.  The 70's about kinky sex.  The 80's about deadly sex.  Other than war, is there any other activity in which human beings seem to participate with so much passion?  Back to this story ... it is New Year's Eve 1981 in New York City, as we follow a series near-adults detour toward their respective roads to the same house party.  Their only goal is to find a date, either before the party, during it or after.  To think the rest of the world, at this very same time in history, was worried about the implosion of the Middle East and Africa, the AIDS epidemic, environmental decay and global warming, just to name a few minor problems.  Anyway, the private party is hosted by Monica (Martha Plimpton), a totally annoying whiner whose low self-esteem is rivalled only by her neurotic self-absorption.  Working their way toward her apartment are Val (Gaby Hoffmann) and Stephie (Christina Ricci), two gum-chewing, nasal-talking louts who couldn't find their way out of a wet paper bag.  Then there's Lucy (Courtney Love) who secretly pines for Kevin (Paul Rudd) who carries on endlessly about his recent break-up with girlfriend Ellie (Janeane Garofalo).  Cindy (Kate Hudson) is an indecisive, accident-prone giggler (much like her mother, the equally irritating Goldie Hawn) who thinks she's falling in love with Jack (Jay Mohr), the simpleton to whom she recently donated her virginity.  Kaitlyn (Angela Featherstone) and Bridget (Nicole Parker) are girls who just wanna get laid, so they pursue anything with a y chromosome including the bartender (Ben Affleck), the cab driver (David Chappelle) and their hostess' ex-boyfriend Eric (Brian McCardie).  Tom (Casey Affleck) and Dave (Guillermo Díaz) round out this group of losers, as two punk rockers in search of true love.  That's it.  That's all.  Bored yet?  It took all of my willpower, motivated primarily by the desire not to waste my video rental fee, to sit through this piece of garbage.  And finally, there are three people in this movie that really should have known better.  There's a cameo by brilliant murder mystery writer Caleb Carr. What were you thinking?!  Elvis Costello actually lends his name, fame and body to the dénouement.  And my advice to Janeane Garofalo?  Fire your agent!

Interesting that this was the year chosen for this trivial plot which tries to reference NASHVILLE and seems at times too cute or smart for its own good, but given that the following year would be the one where AIDS was introduced to the public as a conscious term it seems fitting, especially when most of the cast is at one point or throughout the entire film trying to get laid.However, there are good moments throughout 200 CIGARETTES. One sequence involves Paul Rudd and Courtney Love playing some young urbanites who after some tentative flirtation decide they could be good for each other. Another shows how far an actress will go to make a scene work poor Kate Hudson plays a ditz who get humiliated in more ways than one as she goes to have dinner with her fiancée; she has to spend the rest of the movie with some unpleasant material pasted to the back of her outfit. And Janeane Garofalo, that acerbic, sharp woman, spills out her guts to the ubiquitous cabbie (Dave Chappelle) on the woes of being a woman.A small movie meant for the MTV crowd featuring young veterans Martha Plimpton and Christina Ricci elbowing with other new names such as Ben and Casey Affleck, Jay Mohr, Guillermo Diaz, Nicole Ari Parker, and Angela Featherstone.

You would think that there would be more movies that center around New Years' Eve parties, cause New Years Eve is such a big deal to a lot of people. It's an occasion that often stirs up emotional turmoil, and it involves a lot of strangers meeting at parties, so one would think it would provide plenty of fodder for the screenwriter. But I can't think of many other movies that take place on New Years' Eve. This movie does a really good job at capturing the setting, and they also do a pretty good job at jumping back and forth between tangentially related plot lines without letting any of those plot lines dominate too much.

A movie about getting into a New Years Eve Party? That sounds a little duff to me. And it is a little cheesy some times, but it has funny parts and the good old charm and hilarious moments totally won me over. So, then again, maybe it's not that bad. If you like chick flicks. This movie was much better than expected. I watched it twice and for me, that doesn't happen often. Still a little to much filler towards the end, meaning no doubt they simply ran out of ideas for the script. But it was still their best movie in a long time. A good solid hilarious movie, I'd recommend it to anyone who is tired of the 15 minute script/ One hero saves the world dumb ass action flicks. Check it out.I have always liked the cast of 200 Cigarettes, because they are good at acting and quite nice to look at. Anyway, they are very good in this movie. It has a good plot and good emotional scenes. Very good movie. A must see movie if you like the cast member.It's good to see that it can still make the good stuff happen on the screen. On New Year's Eve, no one wants to be alone. On this night in 1981, several different groups of young desperate people begin a journey from around New York City to a big party hosted by Monica (Martha Plimpton) and new friend Hillary (Catherine Kellner). As the hours pass and no one shows, Monica begins to unravel. She must bribe Hilary to stay with the promise of a clear shot at Monica's old boyfriend, Eric (Brian McCardie). Eric, at that moment is drinking in a nightclub with his new girlfriend, Bridget (Nicole Parker) and her friend Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone). When Bridget learns the host of the party is Eric's ex-girlfriend, she moves in on the bartender (Ben Affleck). Another group consists of two teenagers from Long Island, Monica's cousin Val (Christina Ricci) and Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann). The two get lost on the way when they run into a pair of punk rockers, Tom (Casey Affleck) and Dave (Guillermo Diaz). In a nearby diner, Lucy (Courtney Love) commiserates with her best friend Kevin (Paul Rudd) who has just been dumped by performance artist Ellie (Janeane Garofalo) so she could move in with her therapist. As they bar hop it slowly dawns upon the two that they could be more than friends. Elsewhere, new acquaintances Jack (Jay Mohr) and Cindy (Kate Hudson) are celebrating more than the new year. Cindy lost her virginity to Jack the night before, though is afraid Jack is with her out of sense of obligation. Now if only everyone can get to the party by midnight. Linking the different stories is the disco cab driver (Dave Chappelle) in whose cab the party never stops.Bottom line . . . this movie doesn't have a cheesy script - it's quite realistic.. It's a good movie and I recommend it.P.S. there's actual character development in this movie.NO I'm not kiddingIt contains some parts where they do something fun and exciting, with music, and beautiful actresses and hot actors. Yes, this one did, too, but it was still good! It was funny! I am entertained by this movie. It's funny, well acted and have good music! I mean, you have to respect it for that. Nothing extreme, but still, good. This movie really portrays the meaning of growing up. Kate Hudson, who plays an accident prone tart, and Christina Ricci, who plays a somewhat slutty girl, have grown into really good actresses. I am very impressed with the film and with the girls' acting. The rest of the cast is not bad. The plot could have been a little better but other than that it is very enjoyable.This is by no means a great movie at all, the dialogs are pretty dodgy and the story quite weird also. The main reason why this would be of interest to viewers is that it marks the mainstream film debut of Kate Hudson, who is 20 years old in this film. This movie was one of her first ever jobs and she does a good job, given the material she is working with.  Super funny movie!! I loved it because, well, it's great, but also, because I hate New Years. All actors/actresses deliver great performances with the exception of Courtney Love who is completely annoying. I accidentally landed on this movie really, really late one night somewhere. I was really bored and I couldn't sleep, so I left the channel that 200 Cigarettes on, on. I think I have now seen it at least 5 times and it's become one of those movies that I will always watch again no matter how many times I've seen it. I can imagine why some people hated it though, it is very much a niche movie and no one under 30 will get it. Sometime in the future it will be remembered as the cult film it truly is. Being someone who lived in New York as an awkward young adult during the era this movie is set in, I can tell you that it was so right on I was having flashback.I think this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen for a little while... and I haven't seen any very good movies so far, unless you count this one. It is hilarious and cool and I think that anyone could enjoy it. When my sister took me to see the movie I wasn't sure that it was that good but when I saw it I immediately thought it we should watch it over and over again.It was such a good movie it makes me and my friends want to watch it over and over and over again... All of the characters are funny and different from each other. I think that it is crazy how the people in the movie can live a life style in which they do... It would drive me crazy! Anyway, I am so glad that I saw this movie. This movie was pretty good. There were some funny moments and some okay acting. However, there were a couple of parts that were a little iffy. First of all, I think the two teenagers were supposed to be very slutty, but I totally missed that. I only sort of noticed when one of them started making out with random guys. Second of all, I thought that Angela Featherstone's role was not needed, except to make it a whole bunch of people. I found her lines and character stupid and useless. Nothing against the girl herself, but I thought it was pointless. All of the character you got out of her was that she cared a whole lot about clothes and shopping and the like. Yet, there were plenty of moments in the movie that makes it better. Personally, I adored Cindy (I think. It was the blond one!) and a lot of the acting was great. I enjoyed watching Paul Rudd and everyone else. All in all, this was a pretty good movie, but nothing too wonderful. This movie delights me everytime and leaves me smiling. Maybe it's just one of those things where you had to be there.This movie is a great pick me up on a rainy day.

Not top-notch or even very memorable, but entertaining. I can blame MTV films for trying too hard to please everybody (by using characters that somebody, somewhere, will like) in a film that not everyone can like. I personally disliked Gaby Hoffman's character, from her horrible hair-do to her whiny, condescending personality. But she was believable to a point, whereas her companion Christina Ricci's character isn't very well explained in the movie (Yes, I saw the interview that explained this, but it wasn't explained in the movie and this part actually made her look like a has-been actress.)Oh no, I'm cooking this to a SPOIL!Martha Plimpton's character has got to be the crazy glue of this flick. When she watching the TV and shouting I hate you MOTHER#&@*ERS!!!! I knew I was going to walk away feeling the same way. A movie that's not too deep, not too great, full of interesting (if not already overdone by indie flicks and the like) social commentary, Angela Featherstone in a role that is more than 10 minutes long (and with red hair, YUMMY!!), and some empty-calorie eye candy settings and situations. And of course, no movie of the Gen X influence could not have dog$#!% somewhere in it, they had to have the dog$#!%.

With so many stars on screen at once, what you see is never boring. The costume design, lighting and settings really depict the false style of the glitzy 80's.

Martha Plimpton, Paul Rudd and Ben Affleck stand out amongst the rest of them. Super slut Courtney Love doesn't do herself any justice in her role and is probably the most unconvincing out of the huge cast. Nothing ever really flows naturally and the film seems a but empty. All of the glitter in the world can't make up for it's lack of comedy. But overall, 200 Cigarettes manages to be slightly above average.

In fact the quality of the cast is testament to the script which delivers frequently hilarious situations and one-liners. It tells the story of New Year's Eve 1981 through various groups of two people, all on their way to a party in a friend's flat. Brilliantly, the director Risa Bramon Garcia, manages to focus evenly on each set of characters, no mean feat, considering the sheer number of stars, and star egos, involved. However, it is this achievement which can be seen as the film's main fault. Some characters are not as good as others, in fact some could be left out entirely. Thus, it could be said that the better characters are not developed enough and the viewer does not connect with them.Overlook this minor quibble, though and you'll find a thoroughly enjoyable film.

But I'll try anyway. Here we go.'200 Cigarettes' is a really good film. One of the reasons I like it so much is because it has a big cast filled with very amusing actors. The script is good and each conversation happening between all of the different groups are funny. Set on New Year's Eve, 1981 is the perfect setting for a cute little film like '200 Cigarettes.'The acting was pretty good for some people. I must say that the best came from Jay Mohr, Paul Rudd, Martha Plimpton and Kate Hudson. I really like Paul Rudd (even with the sideburns) and I think that he can do comedy real well. Jay Mohr is equally entertaining. This is the first time that I have seen Martha Plimpton and Kate Hudson in anything and I would definitely like to see them in something else. Now for the not so good acting. Christina Ricci was just plain awful in this film. She's not a New Yorker and I have to agree with everyone with saying that the accent just didn't cut it. Her acting was really bad and her part could have been a little bit bigger. But since her performance wasn't up to standards, I'm glad that her role wasn't any bigger. Why would they put Ben Affleck in such a small role as the bartender? 'How do you like your eggs in the morning, scrambled or fertilized?' What was with that? That was probably the most entertaining line he had in the whole film and that's pretty bad. His brother did better than him. Gaby Hoffmann wasn't exactly perfection. Her accent started to get on my nerves and the fact that all she did was smoke and say f***, didn't make me like her in the role of Stephie. Angela Featherstone also started to get a little irritating. She was good in the beginning but about halfway through, her character just needed to disappear. Courtney Love was good but nothing great. Janeane Garofalo could have done a lot better if her part hadn't been so small. Why?! Casey Affleck was like I said, better than Ben. He wasn't too good but tolerable. Dave Chappelle was just okay as the cabbie. The best thing about his character was his cab. Brian McCardie was perhaps one of the better ones. Not in the top four but he was still good with his Irish accent. Will somebody explain to me why Guillermo Diaz was even included in the cast. He didn't say anything and his character didn't have an effect on the story line. Get rid of him.I was pleased to see so many different groups in different predicaments but all on the same night. They were all good in their own way. I liked Cindy and Jack's situation the most. Their blind date just could not survive. Oh, and the whole thing with Cindy falling in the dog crap was funny. Stephie and Val get lost, they meet these two weird guys and all of a sudden they're punk rockers. Come on! Lucy and Kevin with their constant bickering over Kevin's birthday was pretty good. Bridget and Caitlyn seem to be tiring after a while. Their plan was to get a date before midnight and they just needed to drop that whole thing. Monica was really funny with how she was obsessing over her party. We get through almost half of the movie and all of a sudden, Janeane Garofalo pops up. Her little input to the plot was good even though she had just a few lines. Every situation though was really funny.The ending was good. Who everyone ended up wasn't who exactly I would have wanted but they were all cute. Nice touch with the Elvis Costello thing.So, I would absolutely try to catch this whenever it's on. The writing was good, the acting was decent - very good in some parts, the music played good in the background and the clothing was awful but what can you do? The setting was excellent. Period.

The film contains a little too many characters for its own good.  Many of which are amusing, but the scenes just don't connect.  It's not like Magnolia, where each scene intertwined perfectly with one another, despite the fact that they occurred among different characters.  So that gives the film a disjointed feel.  First of all, the characters are more like caricatures.  They seem to function on a one-note basis.  There is a lot of smoking in this film, deservedly awarding the title, but the cigarettes just seem to be props.  The cigarettes function in the same way a bowl of cereal would function in a scene, and not in the way Humphrey Bogart made it function in Casablanca.Dave Chapelle stands out as the disco cab driver.  He really steals the show.  He delivers most of the film's laughs.  I don't know his name, but the guy who played the Scot was relatively cheesy, and his accent didn't convince me for one minute.  Speaking of cheesy accents, Christina Ricci's was over-the-top.  And it's hard to do an over-the-top Brooklyn accent, because people--being that I used to live there--really do talk like the ones you see in the movies.  But for some reason, her accent didn't convince me.  The performances were spirited, though, and the cast seems to be having a ball.  And we receive a lot of the film's energy via the talented cast.  I just thought the writing could've been sharper and more intelligent.  The whole film runs like a sitcom.  Each vignette is simply a setup for another punchline.  Some of those punchlines are lame, but 75 % of the time they made me laugh.  Of course, the atmosphere seemed to be more like that of an eighties theme party than the actual eighties.  Watch the independent film Whatever and you'll see how it's possible to capture the eighties atmosphere without exploiting its fads to the point where it's begging the audience to get in an eighties frame of mind.  Lucky for the makers of this film, I happen to be a huge fan of eighties music.  So that was another joy in watching a film like this.  200 Cigarettes is altogether harmless, though it doesn't work to its potential.  It delivers just enough laughs and has just enough energy to keep you in the seat--though you might want to drift into the kitchen every now and then for some popcorn.

In fact, it's not too much a pinnacle of anything,except maybe mediocrity. But, like it or not, it's an important film. (Bear with me. I'll explain.)The story of 200 Cigarettes isn't complicated; a bunch of young people try to get to a party thrown by Kate Hudson(pre-Almost Famous, pre-Golden Globe). The story is told through a series of vignettes a la Magnolai or many Altman films. Okay up to here, nothing very special. The cast is mainly made up of new faces; Ben Affleck, Janeane Garofalo (sp?) Christina Ricci and Courtney Love are the best known ones. This is what I want to mention as important. I consider 200 Cigarettes as the 90's answer to The Outsiders (albeit somewhat more flawed) a movie filled with a fresh new cast that'll become big stars. Affleck is already a big star in Hollywood and Ricci is well-known. Hudson is shaping up as a huge star and surely some of the others have been unexploited. Mostly played out as a comedy, 200 Cigarettes isn't completely laughless, but the laughs are few and far between. The style used to intercoup the vignettes is tiresome and afetr one hour wil most likely be more annoying than anything. And yet, this isn't a total turd. The attractive cast,although largely annoying at times, do their best and the movie is bearable. Elvis Costello also shows up as himself in a party that has some odd consequences.

The film stars a slew of up and coming and over the hill, post brat packers, all given scenery to chew, and a wardrobe that looks like it came from Madonna's garage sale.  They are all on their way to some hot New Years Eve party, and as they venture through the streets of Manhatten, they fight and whine their way through their sordid issues.  Paul Rudd and Courtney Love play a couple of friends who can't seem to get over their past relationships.  While Rudd likes to kick garbage cans and punch walls, Love gets by with her usual smirk and smile.  Their story really didn't go anywhere.  And that's not all.

And poor Martha Plimpton, perhaps one of the most under used and under-rated actresses in Hollywood, cries over the fact that no one is showing up for her party. 200 Cigarettes is really much a do about nothing.  An attempt to be intelligent fails miserable in a story that goes no where, and says nothing.  Fans of any of these actors might find it to be an interesting foot note to a career, but as far as films go, 200 Cigarettes is a pass.

The plot was cute and the list of actors/actresses was amazing! I think that every actor/actress played their part perfectly.  Many people may be annoyed at Christina Ricci's Long Island accent and attitude, but that's the character and she did a great job of playing it.  And who does not love a good 80s movie also?  An added bonus is that Elvis Costello has a cameo, c'mon you should see it just for that.  A really good movie that didn't get enough recognition.

It  definitely has its moments, though, if not its  audience.  It resembles a '90s teen party flick  in some ways -- think Can't Hardly Wait -- but  the characters are mostly early '80s 20-somethings.Several separate stories intertwine and converge. Funny in places, touching in places, some stories work, others fail.  It's one of those movies you keep on  recasting in your head, which is not a good sign. It's supposed to be an ensemble effort, but a few of the actors -- especially Courtney Love and Jeanine Garofalo -- are so high-wattage that they overpower their characters.  Ben Affleck manages to rein in his charisma, to his credit, as the clumsy bartender.Over-all, though, I liked it.  I plan to rent it again.

I believe if they shoot me (or any of you) with friends on a  Saturday night, you'll get a movie equal -or more- interesting that 200  Cigarettes.The set is a New Year's Eve in Downtown Manhattan, during the early 80's. The bunch of dudes are supposed to go to this party, but in the meantime, they hang out around town. That's the whole story.

The cast helps a lot - I really enjoyed Courtney Love/Paul Rudd, and Christina Ricci/Gaby Hoffman scenes the most. Parts of it drag a little and it is somewhat redundant, but it really comes together at the end and the last twenty minutes are great.

None of the characters are likeable and every sentence seems to end in an exclamation point.  The motivation of every character centers around going to a party, like it's the most important thing in the world for everyone concerned. The people's lives seem so shallow, so desperate and so pointless that you just wish they'd get a life, or at the very least a hobby that doesn't involve trying to get laid.  A pathetic, banal, disappointing, boring film that must've been financed by the tobacco industry trying to get as many hip stars as possible to smoke their product.  I think this film might've developed celluloid cancer at some point as it's seems to be dying before it can roll the credits. "}]
