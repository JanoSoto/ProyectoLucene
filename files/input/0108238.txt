The kind where he plays the hard boiled cop with a colorful past, but I gave it a chance. This one finds Willis as Tom Hardy. A cop from a family of cops and things aren't going too well. First off, he's just ratted out his violent partner (Robert Pastorelli) at an official police inquiry and that doesn't win him any fans in the department. Then his depressed former partner jumps off a bridge killing himself. What a load to carry. All of the while there's this killer on the loose and when his father is murdered by him, he lets it be known he thinks the killer is a cop and suddenly he's reassigned to River Patrol.This movie succeeds on a basic level -- it's entertaining. Sure the story is loose and the film's surprises are somewhat stale, but it's all in good fun. Willis gets to look aptly serious and hunt for the killer on the waters and there's just enough suspense to sustain interest and the minor twists of the story keep things at a good pace. Meanwhile the rounded supporting cast keeps things lively and keeps the viewer going, Where have I seen him before? or Hey that's such and such.I've read on here how people think this is stupid, dumb and lacks any suspense or thrills. Like any of the Die Hard movies had exceptionally smart stories, you didn't know what was gonna happen next or how it would all end. Of course not. For a entry level Bruce Willis flick, this one satisfies. Now if only I could get the Little Red Riding Hood Song out of my mind...!

The plot, while not ingenious (and even somewhat predictable) is still exciting and will keep you engrossed.The film's creators get a lot of points in my book for locale creativity. Instead of setting the film in some predictable location such as New York, Los Angeles, Miami or San Francisco they set it in Pittsburgh, PA, definitely not your ordinary movie location. It's one that adds a wonderful freshness to the movie however.The location shooting is outstanding. The scenery is different and excellent, the photography is great, even spectacular in places and the action is on a par with some of the best action films ever, including Bullitt. Who would normally think to expect extensive boating and water action in a state as synonymous with mountains as Pennsylvania is? That alone is worth taking a look at this movie.I do not usually care much for Bruce Willis. I thought he was very well cast in this movie however and Sara Jessica Parker added extra special chemistry. The cast is much better than average overall and includes such outstanding actors as Andre Braugher, of the outstanding tv series Homicide. I thought that the casting in general, as well as the photography, location and action very adequately made up for any possible deficiencies in the plot itself.I would warn that there is extensive foul language in this film, more than is necessary even for a film of this genre in my opinion and probably it's biggest drawback. I would still say that the film is well worth watching when your in the mood for some escapist fun and action fare. As I said earlier, I think the film deserves higher ratings than it's gotten so far. I've watched it twice now (it was just as good the second time, in fact even better) and that definitely won't be the last time I watch it.

The troubled cop is haunted by a past incident and is now a detached loner who drinks far too much. Gee, how many times have we seen that before?

Getting back to the cast, most of them are interchangeable with other actors. But there is no substitute for Dennis Farina as tough cop. He ad libs in his own way as well as Hackman & Matthau. If he's a non-smoker in real life, he should have won an Oscar for this role. This is one of those movies where the pre-quels would be just as action packed. Yeah I know the Episode IV thing has been done before in a galaxy far far away. But these characters would be interesting in their younger years.

Fortunately, Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker manage to do just that.This film is highly underrated and under-appreciated, and wrongly so. The performances by even the supporting cast (actors who are known for lesser films and lesser performances) are wonderful.

Truth be told I actually guessed who the killer was before the end- it was a little obvious. The only real shock was when it was revealed that Sarah Jessica Parker was actually working undercover to 'spy on' Bruce Willis (there was certainly a lot to spy on in some scenes, if you know what I'm saying). I did say that it wasn't very original. It is in fact stereotypical Bruce Willis. At the same time, however, there is a certain timelessness to stereotypical Bruce Willis films. The one-liners never get annoying, the action is never not exciting, the swearing is never nonexistent and the nudity is always manageable but yet somewhat awkward for a teenager such as myself.

Roger Ebert tore it to pieces, basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers, and Willis himself said he hated it. After finally seeing it I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a very melodramatic comic-book vibe, which is obvious in the opening act, almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But -- and this is an important but -- I quickly found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the Pittsburgh locations, the (melo)drama and the thrills. In other words, the movie IS entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.The story revolves around Tom Hardy (Willis), a Pittsburgh detective who's demoted to police river rescue. A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river, all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river.This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series, except more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like The General's Daughter. Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or The General's Daughter due to the cartoonishness, Striking Distance nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and gave the requisite thrills. As such, I feel it's at least as good as some of the lesser Dirty Harry films.The generically-named movie was originally called Three Rivers -- a much better title simply because it's more specific -- but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium, so they switched it to Striking Distance. Why? The first hint is at the beginning of the movie when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and, with a stun gun, you must of course be within... striking distance! Speaking of the killer, one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this is a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy; in fact, he and others are sure it's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings. There are a few suspects, including Hardy himself, but -- I'll be honest with you -- I was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.The bottom line is that Striking Distance is a cop thriller that effectively entertains and that's what's most important when it comes to these types of movies. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh, a refreshing change.The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE B "}{"Title":"Predictable suspense-thriller has its moments but overall it's entertaining.","Date":"8 December 2007","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Detective Tom Hardy (Bruce Willis) grows up in the family of cops.

Vince Hardy (John Mahoney). When Hardy's cousin Jimmy (The late Robert Pastorelli) committed suicide from jumping off a bridge. Since Hardy knew there was something wrong with his cousin. Since Hardy's get fired from his job believing that a cop has murder womens in the streets of Pittsburgh but he can't prove it. Months has passed, now Hardy works for the boat patrol for the city. He's forced to work with a young by the book officer Jo (Sarah Jessica Parker) as his new partner. Which Hardy prefers to be alone. When Hardy is called on the crime scene to the river to discover that the latest murders are woman, which Hardy knew before. Now the killer calls Hardy from his phone and he wants to play of Cat & Mouse with him. He has to find the next victim before it's too late, while the local police especially his uncle thinks that Hardy isn't right in the head.Directed by Rowdy Herrington (Road House) made an watchable-thriller that tries to be suspenseful but overall the script is quite predictable sadly. The identity of the villain is too easy to guess for most viewers. Since Willis' was quiet disappointed with his experiencing working this forgotten thriller. But it is not boring, thanks to a strong cast that includes Tom Sizemore, The late Brion James, Andre Braugher and more that keeps this far from being boring. Willis tries to do something different with his role. But his scenes with the character Jo slows the movie down, especially when they start a romance. It is quite unintentionally funny at times and way over the top towards the conclusion. Herrington's previous picture Road House was much more fun to watch than this failed effort. Striking Distance is one of those films that certainly plays better on TV and fans of Willis' work might enjoy this movie much more than others. Check your brain out the door before watching it.

Hudson Hawk (1991), Color of Night (1994) & Cop Out (2010) anyone? Anyway, Striking Distance was known under the title Three Rivers during production & is a decent enough action thriller. One suspects that maybe Willis was trying to star in another Die Hard (1988) but his character here is much less likable or quotable. The script is nothing more than a string of cop film clich√©s stringed together around a fairly basic murder mystery plot & every so often there's a big action set-piece. As it is I quite liked Striking Distance, there are a few decent one-liners, the character's although clich√©d are given life by a good cast or pro's & there's enough action here to satisfy most. There's a particularly good car chase at the start. As I said the clich√©s come thick & fast, a disgraced alcoholic cop, a cover-up, a killer who taunts the cops, feelings of guilt & remorse & loss, honour & family connections. At just under 100 minutes maybe it's a little long but there's enough going on to keep ones interest even if the murder mystery may be a little easy to figure out & a bit too improbable to take seriously. Also the ending features a little overkill when it comes to the villain dying as he comes back from apparently being dead at least four times in ten minutes!There are some good action set-pieces here including a great car chase with one of my personal favourite moments from any chase from any film when the cars start jumping over those humps & shoot up in the air one behind the other. There are boat chases, shoot-outs, fights & a bit of suspense as a mystery killer stalks & kills a few people too. Nicely enough shot there's not much style here but it looks alright.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this has the usual glossy Hollywood production values & is well made. There's a very good cast here including Bruce Willis, Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, Brion James & Tom Atkins with the only weak link the ever awful Sarah Jessica Parker in an early role.Striking Distance is a pretty good action thriller, it has a reasonable murder mystery, some clich√©d cop drama & some good action scenes. It's certainly no worse than a lot of routine Hollywood action thrillers, you could do a lot worse.

This is just as good as a lot of other Willis actioners. Most of Willis's films I like, and this is no exception. It's really a very well plotted revenge thriller, with a great car chase, I might add, which left this flick playing over a couple of months in Adelaide. I like the family angle to it. Willis like his father, (John Mahoney, before Frasier, and years after Code Of Silence, which he made a brief appearance in) is a Pittsburgh cop. So is his Uncle (Dennis Farina) and his two other sons, one of them who's on trial for battery, where Willis gone up against him, telling the court the real version, much to the bitter dislike of his fellow officers. Like Willis's character, Tom Hardy, (catchy) says Look where telling the truth's got me. Sadly at the end of the chase, things went awry, where Mahoney is executed. There's a bigger picture to this story, and I'm not gonna spoil it for ya. Soon after, Farina's bad cop son, where things are not looking to good for him, threatens to jump off the bridge saying Cops don't go to prison. I'm not going. Well, bad cops do. Well, he jumps. His body's never recovered. Cut to a couple of years later, disgraced cop, Willis, now drowning his sorrows in alcohol, and making the best of his stinking situation, now works as a river cop. Everything's just dandy. He lives on a houseboat, has a cat, even gets a surprise visit later from Farina's other out of control, boozing son, now ex cop, (Tom Sizemore, quite impressive here) who like the other cops, initially had it in for Hardy too. Things are looking up when he's partnered with Jo, new to the job. But now things are about to become a living hell, where for Hardy, his haunted past returns, though he's always been haunted, since those tragic events years prior. A score of dead young women, start surfacing on the river waters, all of who have been sexually involved with Willis. He's convinced this is the work of the same killer, responsible for his father's execution. So here's a great thriller ride for you. Too, as an added treat, we have an unrelated action scene on a houseboat, where some hijackers have taken it over, so it's good ol Bruce to the rescue. Too near the end, in it's horrifying revelation, where the killer comes into light, we really learn about family and loyalty, where again to finish the killer off, a cattle crod is used, that instantly had me remembering that scene in The Last Boy Scout. And like the end of Cobra, Willis gets to punch out the loud mouthed cop. See, this film has everything, including a bit of romance and a nice after ending. For Willis fans, specially. Check out the classic opening with the remote control car, cool like the rest of the film.

Already stinging from having to turn witness against his own partner(Robert Pastorelli)over mistreatment of a witness,things go from bad to worse when a high speed pursuit of a perp,believed to be a serial killer,ends in tragedy for the man in question,both personal and career-wise.Flash forward two years,and Hardy now works River patrol,considered a sort of non-essential position in the force,away from his former plain clothes and uniforms--to which he seems to have burned many bridges--and his life has taken a more apparently low key quality. He still cannot play nice with others and earns himself a new partner/diver a chipper,idealistic single mom(Sarah Jessica Parker,still many years away from Sex and the City).Unfortunately,a serial killer is on the loose again,one very similar to the one the force believes they'd captured and convicted already. The MO has Hardy convinced the real killer is out there,but he seems to be the only one who believes this.Very pat elements to this cop drama(stubborn,tough cop who doesn't believe in the blue code,a sadistic killer,Irish/Italaian cop families,etc.)give frame to this still-watchable flick from director Rowdy Herrington(director and co-writer)and Mark Kaplan(co-writer).Willis is completely at home in this,and this is a side of Parker I frankly miss(it seems like forever since she settled on playing chatty,selfish city dwellers with personal problems!). Throw in solid character actors who look the part like Dennis Farina(as Willis' Uncle,a chief mucky muck in the department),Tom Sizemore(as Willis' cousin,a perceived screw-up),Brion James(as a department head who has a natural tendency to chafe Willis' character and vice-versa),John Mahoney(as Willis' Dad,a chief himself),Andre Braugher(in a small part as an inscrutable District Attorney)and Timothy Busfield(as a wormy,by-the-book partner diver;there mostly for physical comedy relief),and you have a film that,while unremarkable in and of itself,is still interesting and works on the designs it was drawn.

The action sequences were pretty standard and run of the mill action scenes, they weren't badly done or wonderfully hit out of the ballpark. Sarah and Bruce had good on screen chemistry, that was a big thumbs up for the film. You could really see their awesome chemistry during their short sex scene, it was really showcased and brought out into the open during that intimate scene.

I'm not even a Bruce Willis fan but i liked this movie a lot, sure it wasn't perfect, had some plot and script/dialogue issues, but actors (Willis, SJ Parker among many others) were quite good and so was the story. Seeing Willis reassigned to river patrol made me think about The Wire (though i guess its should be the other way around), the location being Pittsburg rather than NY, LA or any of the usual places cop movies takes place was nice, the ending was good even though the believability of it left to be desired. Some similarities with the movie The River Murders i guess but it would be wrong to call it a remake of Striking Distance, both should be watched, especially if you liked this one.

Some turn out excellent (Jennifer 8, Silence Of The Lambs) and some flail (The Watcher). This one falls squarely in the fun category, nothing too groundbreaking, but a solid dose of entertaining big city crime pulp. Bruce Willis plays Detective Tom Hardy (lol), whose pursuit of a vicious killer in the excellent prologue leads to the murderer's escape, and Hardy's disgrace. Is prompts Willis to steer his performance into grumpy hangdog territory, which he does oh so well. He's stripped of his stripes, and sent out on harbour patrol with rookie Jo Christman (Sarah Jessica Parker). Stuck with busting rich kids drinking on their parents speedboats, Hardy itches with the urge to still nail the killer. Dennis Farina plays the police chief solidly. Tom Sizemore is his dodgy detective son, a prime suspect, and Robert Pastorelli his other screw up kid. Veteran John Mahoney makes a brief appearance as Hardy's father, as well as nice work from Andre Braugher and Tom Atkins. It's no classic, but it's hard boiled 90's fun, with a cool Willis character and a nice urban vibe of scuzzy, behind dark doors violence, with a nice central whodunit aesthetic.

Tom knows the killer is a cop, targeting him. He's let go from homicide and all that's available to him is river rescue.Two years later, his views haven't changed. The killer is back in full swing, but the police thinks it's a copycat. Tom knows better.The first eight minutes of this consist of a police car - obviously a computer graphic, which was a little off-putting, it was so obvious. This is the type of film that was made for the movie theater - it's loud, it has car chases galore, shootings, crashes - non-stop action.Willis is very good; the rest of the actors are good, too, but they're from television - Willis is the only true movie star.

He gets demoted to the harbour patrol, but still his obsession grows to prove that it was an officer that murdered his father and the girls. A very presentable, slick cop after serial killer thriller with a dependable cast (Bruce Willis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Denis Farina, Brion James, Tom Sizemore and Robert Pastorelli) and interesting backdrop (the beat isn't the streets, but a river system) despite the same old-same, same-old plotting with stock clich√©s and some very implausible revelations. Yes it does go over-the-top for its outlandish climax, but its always exciting, eccentric and high-octane in its routine action and this can said about Brad Fiedel's scorching music too. The opening car chase sequence is actually quite well done by director Rowdy Herrington (who does a durable job throughout with the tough thrills and humid dramas), the taut script keeps it suspenseful and before the killer murders the girl/s he plays the seductively catchy tune Li'l Red Riding Hood by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. Willis provides your usual gruff, maverick cop who likes to get on the bottle (because of past events that sees him not a favourite of the men in blue) and Parker sexes-it up as his greenhorn partner. James is great in the role as the smarmy detective always looking to pick a fight with Willis' character and Farina is solid as usual. Also showing up in small parts are Tom Atkins and John Mahoney.

He can rarely do wrong with the exception of most the 2000's (small joke.) Striking Distance was solidly into his leading man career that made him an action superstar. Striking Distance didn't appear to have the enormous budget of like minded Willis vehicles (30 million vs 70 million for Die Hard 2, 3 years earlier) but that is part of its charm. Striking Distance is part mystery, part thriller, a dash of action, and some great character depth even if the lead character is a little bit predictable as a washed up, alcoholic, traumatically scarred former cop. Willis plays the broody alcoholic like nobodies business. The mystery is solid, and the action scenes are well done. It even features one of the best and most underplayed car/boat chase scenes in action film history...or at least the nineties. A terrific supporting cast of whose who nineties character actors help move the story along and support Willis throughout. Sometimes movie watchers like mystery, dislike action, or some variation of such but Striking Distance gives a little of all of the major genres to make it the perfect film for just pure entertainment.Bruce Willis is the iconic macho man. I could watch him do just about anything. As the aforementioned brooding former cop spending his days as barely more than a security guard on the waters. The character is not revolutionary and can be considered predictable but Willis makes Tom Hardy the best he can possibly be and that's a bad ass good guy. Remember Sarah Jessica Parker before she was Sex and The City's Carrie Bradshaw? Me neither but she is cute and vivacious as fellow boat cop Jo Christman. The character doesn't truly fit into the dreary, dark and often foreboding setting but somehow Parker impressively makes it work. Equally impressive is the fact that Parker and Willis do have decent chemistry and their romance somehow works although it feels forced into the story at times. The whose who supporting cast I mentioned include talented character actors, and TV actors. The most noteworthy are Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, Brion James, Robert Pastorelli (really terrific), and John Mahoney (small role but really terrific as Willis' decorated cop father.) Director Rowdy Herrington isn't big in Hollywood but he can be attributed to helming the 80's classic Roadhouse and now Striking Distance. Given his ability to direct two big leading men and let them be what the audiences love should account for something. I have a feeling though Herrington's directing ability ends there. Given something without a leading man probably wouldn't account for much although I haven't seen any of his other work. Striking Distance is just plainly entertaining. It isn't mind blowing and it isn't likely to be most peoples favorite film but it is one that I frequently go back to on a lazy Sunday afternoon for some simple, well made entertainment. It also isn't necessarily considering one of Willis' big films by any means but at the same time is gem amongst his work from the nineties. Definitely worth watching at least once and you'll find its charm beneath the surface. 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Lots of Drama, Mystery & Romance","Date":"16 May 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Bruce Willis, (Tom Hardy)The Family Stone,'05, plays a former detective in homicide and wound up on a River Patrol in Pittsburgh.

Striking Distance deserves a lot more credit than that.  This film is so different from Bruce Willis' other action films, like Armageddon and The Last Boyscout, that it is almost in another genre altogether.  Willis stars as a disgraced 5th-generation Pittsburgh cop demoted to river patrol when he suggests a cop is responsible for his father's murder, and several new murders taking place two years later.  The entire police force, including Dennis Farina and the late Brion James (both a little over-the-top with their resistance to Willis' accusations) writes him off as crazy, except for his new partner, played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  He is also taking much heat from testifying against his own partner and cousin in a criminal trial.Willis turns to the bottle for comfort until he begins to pick up clues as to who the murderer is.  Several good action sequences, including a great opening car chase and a boat chase, as well as an entertaining sequence involving a hijacked tugboat, make Striking Distance better than most cop thrillers.  If you are a fan of any of the stars, I recommend this film.

The clich√©s keep piling up from the bad-mouthing, trash- talking banter between Irish and Italian cops, to the endless profanity, and the staginess of the big scenes. It's also pretty violent. Bruce Willis is almost always a good action hero. Sarah Jessica Parker knows how to do the girl part perfectly. Their scenes have real chemistry. Dennis Farina is always a great cop and he manages to keep you fascinated even when his sons are acting perfectly ridiculous. John Mahoney, Andre Braugher and Timothy Busfield show their talent and professionalism and are captured before bigger roles made them major TV stars. I did find Braugher chewing up the scenery a bit too lustily in the hearing scene. I save Robert Pastorelli's utterly hammy appearance for last. He's a fine actor and I loved his classically funny house painter, Eldin on Murphy Brown. But he's assigned the psycho role here and the screenplay doesn't give him any depth at all. He's just an insane psychopath. There's not a clue as to why he behaves as he does. Maybe the director should have stepped in more to tone it down. The final confrontation with Willis steals from every thriller you've ever seen, most obviously Fatal Attraction. And it goes on forever.

While I do admit the movie is far from a 10 and had numerous flaws, I liked it. It was different. Not just another cop/serial killer movie-a genre I don't even like very much. This movie was good for a couple of reasons.One is the photography. Most of it takes place in boats on the river and the scenery is beautiful. The movie is moody and gloomy, in perfect keeping with the storyline. The other good-and different thing is the character development. This is really less a serial killer movie, then a movie about the characters themselves. The movie develops the character of Tom so he is believable and focuses more on him as a person then on the shenanigans of the serial killer-though those are there to. But it's really one man's quest, both to find the serial killer and to find out the truth of past events. I liked the movie.

This decreases his popularity amongst the other officers and leads to a demotion to a river rescue squad with Sarah Jessica Parker. Suddenly women he knows are found in the river and he suspects that it could be linked to his father's murder. Plot is as dead as the victims with a climax wallowing in its violent muck. Director Rowdy Herrington handles the plot twists as well as high powered action sequences but the screenplay provides nothing that hasn't been done countless times. Willis survives the dread as he accepts his demotion as a trespass to further clues involving his past. Sarah Jessica Parker only exists as a possible love interest. Not to sound sexist but generally the females in these films are there more or less for physical encounters with the hero. Parker is far above this material but is wasted in a role that is presented pretty much so to put a female in the film. She lucked out and got cast in this junk.

His father is killed. He suspects the strangler is a police officer. The police make an arrest based on a questionable witness. Jimmy jumps off a bridge to escape prison time and presumed dead. Two years later, Tom has become a drunk and transferred to River Rescue. Jo Christman (Sarah Jessica Parker) is his new diver. The killings start up again and this time, the killer is directly taunting him.This is an overwrought unreal police thriller. The opening car chase is crazy. It's borderline joyous fun and I'm willing to go with it. However that's not where this movie is going. When Jimmy jumps off the bridge, all of a sudden the heaven opens up and rain pours down. The movie keeps pushing everything over the top. Dennis Farina and Tom Sizemore never stop yelling or talking intensely. Sarah Jessica Parker is playing a hottie in this one. There are some unbelievable things going on that feel unrealistic. This movie could use a little simplification and a lot more believability.

At least she wasn't Susan Sarandon.In the city of Pittburgh (Jeff Goldblum's hometown) a cop (Bruce Willis) comes too close to finding out that a serial killer is another cop and he is transferred to river patrol with Sarah Jessica Parker. But then the bodies start showing up in the river.Bruce Willis has gone on record as saying this movie sucks, but he's really being too harsh on himself. While it is true this movie does not really stand out as a great action flick (like his Die Hard films or Hostage) and you have a fairly good chance of guessing the killer in the first five minutes, the film is entertaining and has enough action and suspense to keep you in your seat.It has Dennis Farina! It has Tom Sizemore, who never disappoints (haven't you seen Lock Up or Strange Days?).

While they offer nothing in the way of intelligence or substance, this sort of film is always good if you just want ninety minutes or so of entertainment. While this film isn't the greatest waste of time movie ever conceived, it's not the worst either and it benefits from Bruce Willis' star power. The star of the show plays a cop who, after blaming the police department for the death of a fellow policeman - his dad, gets relegated to the less than exciting post of 'water dog', which, for the less savvy amongst you - is a policeman who rides in a boat rather than a car. However, our hero believes that the man the department sent down for the death of his father and several other people isn't really the killer at all, and that the real fiend is still on the loose. This all appears to be true as well, when our man starts finding bodies of women he knows in the river that he patrols.This film's main downfall is that it's just too silly to be taken seriously. The car chase at the start of the movie gives a good indication of the sort of film that you're in for, as it's extremely overlong and throughout the movie - from the over the top start to the very over the top climax, this film makes no attempt to ground itself in reality. It's not hard to see why Willis took the role, however, as seeing the amount of action in the script; this movie is a good vehicle for him to cement his 'action star' status in. Sarah Jessica Parker is the love interest, and throughout the movie she looks out of place and uncomfortable. Of course, nowadays she's famous for being in the terrible sitcom 'Sex and the City', so no matter how she performed in this film; she'd look out of place. There are better thrillers than this one for you to waste your time on, but this isn't all that bad. It's forgettable after a few days, but at the time of viewing; it's a fun ride.

With Willis, it is that wink at the audience, a sort of Milton Berle aside that says ` I'm an actor and you know I know you know it. I'm here to entertain you and we can both share in watching me have fun.' In this, he follows a trend begun by Gable (in `It Happened One Night') and became attached to a career first (I think) with Cary Grant.Willis has some power as an actor, but he just cannot escape this winking mode. It worked in `Die Hard' stuff, `Pulp Fiction,' (where his role as boxer-performer mirrored it) and in `6th Sense,' where the two roles of winker and character were leveraged in the story twist.But this film neither wants nor needs that wink. It makes no attempt to exploit it. And as a result comes off as a simple TeeVee movie-level project.

Well I'm telling you all that this is John Chard and you all should go as far away from this movie at the opening credits. It's truly awful and probably stands up as a candidate for biggest collective waste of actors in the 1990s.Directed by Rowdy Herrington (Road House), who also co-wrote it with Marty Kaplan (The Distinguished Gentleman), it's not unfair to say that expectation isn't set too high with that collaboration. But the cast on the other hand does suggest we are in for a popcorn thriller of some note. Oh how wrong that suggestion proves to be. Although Bruce Willis was at the time on a run of poorly received film's Pulp Fiction and a career invigoration was a year away, he still had two Die Hard movies behind him and a cult favourite in The Last Boy Scout. He was still an action star of some credibility and a draw card. Joining him in the cast are Dennis Farina, Brion James, Tom Sizemore, Andre Braugher, John Mahoney and Tom Atkins. Oh and Sarah Jessica Parker (the sarcasm is intentional). What transpires with this collection of thesps is just over 100 minutes of clich√© riddled rubbish devoid of suspense and tension.It's a pity the film is so bad because an action/cop film set on and around a river should have made for a refreshing change. Lots of boaty action mixing with a serial killer plot seemed like a good idea, but they didn't get a decent writer or director in did they? From the off all eventualities are sign posted. The killer is obvious, and this in spite of myself trying desperately not to notice the obviousness of it. I actually thought to myself that surely the makers wouldn't take the viewers for being that stupid? Even the staple requirement of a red herring jumps up and hits you on the head with a dull thud. Parker is awful, tho in fairness her character serves only to be a token bit of totty lining up to do all the same things every other badly written female cop has done in prior movies. Then there is the performance of the actor playing the villain for the film's finale. So laughable you will be forgiven for checking the DVD case to see if you picked up a Laurel & Hardy movie by mistake. The one saving grace for action junkies is a tidily constructed car chase sequence in the first quarter, but from there on in it goes downhill in quality. For the big key section set in and around a log cabin, you may find yourself stifling the laughter; such is the bad quality of the action and execution of the scenes. This is a film containing men who before this film had been in Die Hard, Midnight Run, True Romance, Red Heat, Beverly Hills Cop II & Lethal Weapon.

The facial contortions he exhibits when he shoots a gun is so ham and often repeated throughout his career. ( Don't get me wrong, some of his films, if not his work, I am very fond of). You either love Sarah J, Parker or not. But it strikes me odd that she has been in SO many love scenes and starred in the Sex & The City shows and movies, yet she obviously takes herself too serious as their must be a no-nip clause in all of her contracts. I guess whats good enough for serious actresses like Helen Mirren, Susan Sarandon, Kate Winslet, and Julianne Moore isn't good enough for her. The film This is a 19 year old movie, so I am going to assume the plot has been well covered here. But I couldn't get passed a couple of things Great opening car chase scene, highly frenetic, however father and son are having a completely sedate personal conversation. Its one thing to be in control of your emotions, its another being inhuman. So they get in this rolling car crash, its the middle of the day and apparently they all just sat there for hours and hours because its dark when the other cops ( some involved in the pursuit) arrive at the scene. Second big thing, you have our villain, a cop. He's on the bridge for the longest time. All of his relatives are cops, his dad is a cop. There's is the omnipotent river patrol, who our protagonist joins later in the film. Yet, when the villain jumps in, the river patrol cant immediately find him? After all, all of the other dead bodies are found, and apparently the river is pretty clean ( of course not) because we see night-time underwater sequences. Wouldn't they want his body recovered? They certainly had the resources. Minor things Why was the guy who dumped a throw-rug so anxious to risk life&limb and his car ( which explodes) over it? Was this our villain? Never explained. The worst things for me had to be Sarah's mushy court-room testimony, and Brion James ( who I like in other films) who is so over-the-top angry about everything its just plain humorous, or his diatribe in the end when he eats crow and ego strokes Bruce.

The movie has some solid action sequences and several unexpected twists, but it is clearly one of Willis' lesser efforts from the early 1990s. He low-keys it throughout, taking the drinking and depression thing too far. And seeing him in shorts doesn't exactly help, even if they are part of his new uniform. Parker does her best against overwhelming odds, and is joined in her efforts by veteran character players Dennis Farina, Brion James and John Mahoney.

The director has done nothing special.  So how do they get to be the core creative force behind a movie?  Why not get somebody with talent to at least oversee the project?  Do they drag people off the street to write screenplays now?  This is extremely frustrating, how many talented people are ignored so that high-school drop-outs can write for the big screen?The film starts off being a dated, cliched police thriller.  And that's as good as it gets.  It says something about the careers of all the actors involved - they must either be desperate, or they'll do *anything* for money.If you're the kind of person who still can't work out how sundials work, or if you're *really* drunk, then you may enjoy this predictable, unthinking movie.  However, if you like a little imagination and plausibility in a production, avoid this like the plague!

A chase scene that has either bullet holes in the windshield, or doesn't. When it does they are different than the scene seconds before. Willis has a shotgun, and then it vanishes without a trace. I am pretty sure that the cops don't stand on both sides of a car and blast away, they would shoot each other if that happened. Guys get shot but there is no trace of blood or bullet holes. Plot? Yea, right. This was two hours of my life I will never get back! If it wasn't for the visual of Sarah Parker in her tight shorts I would have turned it off. Tom Sizmore still can't act.

Of course first-time viewers applying first-class logical reasoning skills will never guess the answer, because someone (presumably the writers) cheats at the end and introduces the deus ex machina device. Dating back to Greek tragedy, deus ex machina is when an artificial character is suddenly introduced to untangle a hopelessly contrived plot. Looking back for clues to the involvement of this character you realize that there are none and that the writers have intentionally kept the audience ignorant, a cheap way to surprise the viewer, the drawback being that the technique makes it impossible to inject even the tiniest bit of suspense into the viewing process. What clues there are were inserted just to jerk the viewer around. They cheat again with another of those stupid villain resurrection fight sequences at the very end. You know this tired stuff, show evidence that the villain could not possibly have escaped then have him Jason-like magically surface alive and kicking. The sad part being that it doesn't work (which must have been obvious during the editing process), it is totally unnecessary, and it could have been seamlessly trimmed out during post-production. Lose those moronic 20 seconds and you could add about 10 IQ points to the target audience. That said, it is otherwise an entertaining film. Bruce Willis plays a trouble-making Pittsburgh cop named Hardy and.... big surprise.... he's unpopular with the department brass. He is demoted and paired with Sarah Jessica Parker patrolling the three rivers for the River Rescue Squad. Their romance is predictable but the chemistry is good and the relationship has a nice low-key charm. The river patrol provides an opportunity to stage some nice 1940's style action and chase scenes. Hardy is very easy to identify with so you can get a nice vicarious rush from his point-of-view. Handy is unpopular because he testified against his first partner in a police brutality case, because he insists that a serial killer is still at large, and that only someone on the force could be the serial killer. So mystery #1 is the identity of the serial killer. Mystery #2 is who killed Hardy's father (a police Captain) about the same time as the first round of serial killings. . His uncle (Dennis Farina) is on the force, and at one time so were two of his uncle's sons, Hardy's cousins and childhood friends. Not much is revealed about them because doing so would require a much more intelligent screenplay. One seems to be a violent nut case so you know he could not possibly be involved in the killings. Roger Ebert summed it all up nicely in a template A rebel cop stirs up trouble and is disciplined, but determines to stay on the trail of a serial killer, while meanwhile he is assigned a partner that first he hates and then he likes, while the killer cleverly tries to frame him. Add several chase scenes and a deadly confrontation in which all of the key characters magically congregate at the same time. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

With a cast this good, it takes a colossal effort to make a film this bad. Police officer with what seems his entire extended family also on the force, gets caught up in the case of a homicidal maniac known as the Polish Heights strangler in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the course of the pursuit of the suspect, (unseen at this point, so why they suspect him of the crimes we don't know, nor are we given any answer), the cops' father dies of a gunshot wound, supposedly at the hands of the Killer. After some hectic times when the cop testifies against his partner (who also happens to be his cousin) in a brutality lawsuit (guess there isn't a blue shield), and the subsequent suicide of the cousin, whilst jumping from a Bridge into the River (although they fail to realize there are three major rivers in Pittsburgh, Monongahela the Allegany and the Ohio) the cop is sent to the River POlice. Don't quite understand why they'd put a flawed cop on a river beat, especially since most characters see him as a raging alcoholic, not exactly the type of person you want to see driving a boat. Years later, some killings occur that closely resemble the murders from years before. Lots of dumb red herrings fill the movie, as well as an unlikely pairing of Willis and Parker, plus a ridiculous ending where a handcuffed Willis beats a homicidal maniac while swimming. Just hands down a terrible film. Writing stinks, the direction stinks, and overall the performances are just mailed in.

We all know them...Lethal Weapon, The Last Boyscout, Bad Boys, etc.All these movies are chock full of clich√©s. The evil guys are all sadistic bastards with a bad sense of humor, every time a thug gets shot one of the 'good guys' makes a witty comment, the cops always have issues with their bosses ('you're a loose cannon'), there's always some divorce or other major personal issue inter-weaved in the storyline and that situation is resolved in the end, after a spectacular shoot-out. Specifically true for Bruce Willis movies is the fact that he's always hungover, divorced, and always muttering in himself complaining about all the crap he gets to deal with. Now...I love those aspects. They bring up a certain sense of nostalgia. But there's got to be more than just the clich√©s. In really good action movies you have in addition a semi-intelligent storyline, sufficient acting and original action-sequences. And now we get to the point...Striking Distance lacks them all. Everything 'The Last Boy Scout' (which I happen to have viewed last night) does right, goes wrong here. The humor isn't funny, the acting is mediocre to poor and the whole story is painfully contrived. Are we supposed to believe that Jimmy has spent two years waiting (for no good reason) doing God knows what until he can get his revenge. Even the song used during the killings didn't send chills up and down my spine like it ought to. Don't even get me started about the horrible supporting cast. The only cast members who deserve to walk away from this movie without shame are Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore (who was good IMO) and Bruce Willis. And the script...how did that ever get produced? One of the poorest ones I've seen in a long time. I can go on and on but I think I made my point. I guess if you line up SD against all other action movies it makes for a more than average action movie. But comparing it with other Bruce Willis flics is painful. Seeing his name on the poster usually sets a high expectation for me, I'm sure the same applies for most people. In the end SD only barely rises up from mediocrity, and therefore it disappoints (being a Willis flic).

The plot has Bruce Willis as an ex-cop. His father (John Mahoney) was killed in a car accident while Brucey and Daddy were chasing a madman strangler. Now, years later, as Brucey works boat duty on a river, all of Bruce's (ex?)-girlfriends are being killed off by a strangler. Or, as Brucey himself puts it, He's killing them and dumping them in the water so I'll find the bodies. This film is a lot like another Brucey-no-brainer, Mercury Rising, which had a decent beginning but got screwed up a quarter of the way in due to extremely bad dialogue, a boring pace, and extremely bad plot twists (like no one saw the ending here?). Speaking of the ending, that's another thing about this film The ending is absolutely typical and predictable. I've seen it done a million times before. Different faces, same story.The on-the-side romance with Sex and the City's dog-ugly actress (not to mention Matthew Broderick's wife) Sarah Jessica Parker is very typical, also. Hard to get girl is hard to get until she sees the guy's inner beauty, sleeps with him, and then is held hostage by the killer at the end so he/she has some sort of collateral against the Hero of the Story (in this case, our man--or his own man--Brucey). I didn't see it coming. (Not.)I was looking forward to a nice co-star role by John Mahoney when I saw this film (better known as Frasier's dad on the NBC television show Frasier), but you don't find out he dies in the first five minutes of the film until you rent the *darn*ed thing. Arghh! No wonder they put his name last on the casting bill without an and John Mahoney or with John Mahoney as Brucey's Dad. Another arghh!I won't say that Striking Distance isn't easy to watch--when it's on TV I (somehow) find myself half-paying attention to it (if nothing else is on). But even the guilty pleasure of it is hard to accept, because it's so darn lousy. Only worth seeing if there is absolutely nothing--and I mean nothing--on TV. I'd much rather watch Mercury Rising again than have to sit through this load-a-tripe (well, maybe not, but you get the picture).2/5 stars (it deserves lower, but I gave that much to Mercury Rising, and they're on the same level of lousiness) -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Poor plot, awful twist and no tension.

Nicknamed Little Red Hiding Hood, the killer kidnaps and murders women before dumping their bodies. Police Officers Vincent and Tom Hardy are father and son and on their way to a policeman's' ball (despite Tom being considered a 'rat' within the precinct) when the call comes in that the killer has been located. A chase ensues that ends with the killer escaping and Vincent dead. When Tom accuses the police department of brushing over the investigation by arresting a man who Tom believes is innocent and, when he puts forward his theory that the killer is a cop, he is busted down to River Patrol as punishment. Years later bodies start showing up in the river, Tom starts to investigate, adamant that the killer is still out there and is mocking him.Before Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys showed that he could act and Die Hard 3 also returned his box office clout, Bruce Willis seemed to be headed to a ruined career. He was making pretty poor films and he made a run of films between 1991-94 that, frankly, were bad. Colour of Money, Last Boy Scout, Hudson Hawk and Bonfire Of The Vanities were pretty poor and whatever value they may have had was ruled out by the bad business they did at the box office. Here is one of his films that would barely be considered for a low budget video thriller were it not for Willis being in the cast. The plot is really thin and far from special. It opens up with an enjoyable car chase but after that it gets poor and stays that way. The film wanders for a bit while introducing Willis' new partner (a woman &#150; he hates her but I wonder if they'll hit it off at any point?!) but then gets down to the business of the killer. It isn't really ever exciting or gripping and the final twist is laughably bad &#150; it's like they had a contest to come up with the stupidest twist they could, although, having said that, it is also depressingly obvious after 15 minutes of the film if you have seen some of this genre.The cast are not terrible, just stuck with bad material. Willis is sleeping walking which is why he started making such average films - even Die Hard 2 suffered from his laziness. Here he shows everything that is bad about him as an actor, he is lazy, uncharismatic and just lacking in any of the unique touch and wit that made me fall in love with him in the original Die Hard. However the support cast are actually quite good on the whole and make the film feel better than it is simply due to the number of faces on screen. Parker is pretty poor but the rest do OK because they aren't stuck with a cr*p love-interest role. Farina is fun, Sizemore has little to do but is a familiar face. Mahoney has a very small role but is worth it and it's cool to see Braugher, Busfield and James even if Pastorelli is just laughably stupid!Overall this is a video thriller with a poor plot, awful twist and no real tension or excitement despite the promise posed by the opening car chase. The only thing that makes it stand out from those is the fact that it fluked a handful of big names in the cast &#150; however, their presence alone cannot lift the material off the bottom shelf of your video store or the midnight slot on your cable station where it rightly deserves to be.

This history will show that US movies died in the late sixties and were replaced by what seemed at first a more personal cinema that quickly degenerated into the glorification of the criminal lifestyle (Bonnie and Clyde, The Godfather) and raising the violent content every year. Personal became formula and the formula was = sadistic violence + unidimensional action anti-hero + comic book plot with extremely well delineated villains who commit repulsive crimes + kaboom! + possibility of a sequel. Striking Distance is the epitome of that formula, except for the fact that it was so bad on every level and the clich√©s were so transparent no one ever considered making a sequel. If you take into account the number of plot clich√©s in the film, it can already be considered a sequel to a thousand other films, one that is so degenerate they didn't even bother to give it the name of the preceding piece of trash. The funny thing is this was considered mainstream film-making in the 90's and all the actors are, if not brilliant, at least famous and expensive. On an appearance in May 2004 on On the Record with Bob Costas (2001), Bruce Willis actually apologized to the movie-going public for this film, saying that it sucked. He might as well have apologized for most of the American films of the 70's, 80's and 90's. "}]
