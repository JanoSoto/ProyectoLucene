The producers have attempted to bring the story down to a kid's level by eliminating key elements from the original and introducing new characters that would make Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein both turn over in their graves.  The King no longer has a harem here, and his 106 children have been reduced to a mere 8.  The Prime Minister has been transformed into an evil wizard who uses a magic gong in an attempt to overthrow the King, and he is aided by a bumbling fat midget who keeps having his teeth knocked out.  Then there is the onslaught of cute animals including a monkey, an elephant and a panther that constantly save the King by hurling mangoes at the villains.  Many of these new characters are directly stolen from Disney films, especially from `Aladdin.'  If all this was not enough, we even get a scene where the King rides in a hot air balloon that is powered by a panther riding a bicycle mounted to a propeller.  And just to make sure that we have a happy ending, absolutely NOBODY dies in this version.  Admittedly, seeing this was an animated feature I was fully expecting some liberties to be taken, but I was not expecting a rewriting of the entire story.The film's worst moments come during the musical scenes.  Some of Rogers and Hammerstein's music manages to make it onto the screen but it is handled in such a way that it makes your stomach turn.  For example, the movie begins with Anna singing `I Whistle a Happy Tune' while a sea monster attacks her.   The King sings `A Puzzlement' while being attacked by giant statues that have suddenly come to life.  Then there are the kids that sing `Getting to Know You' while being stalked by the fat midget.  At the screening of this film I kept sinking deeper into my seat and saying, `Tell me this isn't happening!'

Animation can be great, especially if it allows us to see something that we otherwise wouldn't, but this effort is a disaster. Just because Warner had the rights to reshape the story doesn't mean that it was wise to do so. I suggest either the original drama >Anna and the King<, a rather adult approach with much darkness that fits the original story, or the more accessible live-action musical >The King and I<, which has the benefits of Richard Rogers' musical score. It looks much like an attempt to capitalize upon either >Beauty and the Beast< or >Aladdin<, both infinitely better.This animated film is a disaster from the start. It tries to make a fairy tale out of a story from the nineteenth century by adding sorcery and magical devices that mock the norms of nineteenth-century thought. Sorcery and the hyper-rational nineteenth century do not mix.Some of the animated sets, I concede, are attractive. That said, the treatment inexcusably confuses Chinese and Thai culture. (To be sure, Thailand has a large Chinese diaspora, and it is quite influential, but not dominant).Many of the characters are over the top, including the devious Prime minister who exploits a big-screen magic mirror and wears a Colonel Klink-like monocle and has a stereotypical stooge as his confederate. The animals are excessively cute and unrealistic, including the sterotypical 'mischievous monkey' and the King's cuddly pet panther(?), not to mention some of the most unrealistic elephants that we have ever seen and the snakes that the evil Prime Minister conjures out of vines. We've seen it all before, and this time it doesn't work.Forget this one. Too many valid alternatives exist for this general story. If you want magic in an animated flick, then seek something in a more mystical time (such as >Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs< or place (the beautiful-but-creepy world of >Spirited Away<.Don't debase your video collection with this derivative rubbish.

The Western didn't know about our culture.  And the story is just Anna's view point which no one knows that it's all true or something she made from her own idea.  That's what I can accept.  However, I can't believe the director and script writer of this globalization period do this with Thai culture.  Magic and love story of our Prince Chulalongkorn with Tubtim are not true at all.  Do you know that Thai people love and respect our royal family, especially Prince Chulalongkorn was our King Rama V who did many good things for Thailand?  Do you feel ashamed to do like this?  (I just wanna ask the director and script writer.) Thus, I think I can accept the classic one more than this cartoon.  And I hope the film which Jo-yun Fat performes will be better.

Anna is supposed to be a logical, brave schoolteacher from America (or England, Canada? I can't remember), but she ends up coming across as this annoyingly assertive dope. Her son is just a wimpy little dork dressed in weird stretch pants , sailor hat and blazer. The king, who doesn't seem to have a name, has exaggerated and bizarre anger issues. Master Little is a morbidly obsese, Buddha-esque guy with stereotypically slanted eyes and a weird voice. Most of the characters are flat, with no originality or personalities at all; they stick to their story roles but have no outside interests, nothing to make them memorable. Since the producers already tried turning the story into something out of a Disney movie or Scooby-Doo episode, they could at least try to make the characters interesting! My advice? Don't even bother with this, and don't subject your children to it. It's almost as bad as that stupid Ferngully movie and is probably one of the worst animated movies I've seen in some time.

No story structure, no character development, nothing. They butcher the song segments making them look pointless and stupid. The comedy relief was more annoying and less funny. Particularly the monkey named Moonshee whom is ripped off from, er I mean inspired by Abu, every other second, I wanted to kill Moonshee, he was that annoying. Also, the villain's assistant Master Little looks like Chien-Po's (Mulan) midget brother whom has the curse of unfunny running gag by getting his teeth knocked out. What was also stupid was replacing Lun Tha with an adult Chulalongkorn. the story of Tuptim and her lover was a really sad, tragic story and I see they tried to clean it up but they did a really bad job at it. However, the King's panther Rama was the only character I found likable.Well, to wrap this up, this is a really boring film, like the summary says, it should have been adapted by the real Disney, not some other company trying to imitate Disney.

In that regard, the movie reached its target.I was a bit disappointed, but certainly not to the passionate degree I've seen here. I certainly was not expecting a line-for-line remake of the Brynner-Kerr film, nor a remake of any of the dozen or so live productions of the play that I've seen.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by Disney features or the wonderful Fleischer material of the 1930s.The musical numbers were buried under visuals that didn't match-- I agree with the other posters who complained about the scene in which Whistle a Happy Tune was sung-- and some of the 1990s devices such as the cute animals and the martial arts demonstrations simply left me longing to see the original film again.But that's me.I'm renting the original movie for my kids to see which they prefer; this is more an experiment in learning what reaches them as opposed to the appalled father saying Good Lord, what an abomination!

Martin Vidnovic was trying to replicate Yul Brynner, and in no way did he succeed. Adam Wylie has a false English accent, that was shown when he was singing, because his American accent was heard. Ian Richardson is a really good actor, but I was expecting more from him. He had lots of really good lines, but his delivery just felt a bit OTT. The worst character was Master Little, who was funny for only ten minutes, and then the occurring joke about teeth wore thin far too early. Don't get me started on the animals. they were cute at first, but they served no purpose at all to the plot, especially Moonshee.

As for the romance between Tuptim and the Prince it was so unnecessary, and the romance between Anna and the king was painfully underdeveloped. And why did they change the ending?

One, I saw this in the cinemas with my family when I was little and I enjoyed it a lot. And secondly when I'm doing this review, I am not going to compare this film to the 1956 film because i have not seen that version.So after a long time, I decided, why not, let's give the king and I (1999) a try. In the first 20 minutes, I instantly turned off the film, finding it funny as hell but really thinking what the hell at the same time. The next day, I watched the other half which bored me to death. After seeing the whole film being much older now, I think of it in a totally different way. As a kid, I liked it. But now more grown up, I think this film was animated garbage and it was awful. Very rotten as well. It was so messy. And here's why First, I think the story is far too simple and I wish they could have gone into great detail throughout the film. I also think that most of the characters are unbelievably stupid, annoying, laughable and dull in every scene. There definitely wasn't much going on with these characters that I just couldn't care about them after wards. The King is like an anti-action would be hero who continually blab-bas on repeating some of the same crap WHAT, WHAT, WHAT!. Seriously, and even the main villain was cheap. He was just there sneaking and running around trying to scheme his little plan. His objective was stupid as hell. There were a lot of stupid moments as well.Some of these stupid moments consist throughout but I think the most silliest was when this dragon tries to attack this woman, her boy, a monkey and a crew on their boat. The crew and all have no idea what to do until the mother and her boy start whistling. The dragon then disappears into smoke. Really dumb and quite laughable. I know this is a kid's cartoon but come on, there could have been a better way to kill that thing.The sing alongs also don't save it and the music throughout could have been so much more. It was merely the only decent part of the film but because of messed up characters, story, bad moments and plot gaps, the music is poorly contrasted with random scenes and it becomes a shamble which doesn't even get the film to it's full peak. And the thing which really bugged me throughout was the animation and change of scenes.For example in one scene, we see the main villain and this fat guy who is his assist are seen talking near a bridge. At first we see the main villain with his normal clothing. That being a red shirt and some shorts. And then quickly in the next shot, he is seen wearing his suit and then it cuts to another shot where a glass eye piece full off of his head and then another quick shot flies in quickly and we see that he hasn't even put it on. It's just there on him. There are many other poor animation tactics which go on about throughout this film, but I'm not going to go into it.The only two things I thought were done OK is these two moments with the main villain and the king. If you've seen this garbage where the villain is whipped on the bum by the panther at the end of the king and his discussion and the part with the villain telling the king about the so called teacher leading the kids outside the palace. They were the only parts in the entire film I thought that weren't done badly. Although that is my only positive notion for it, doesn't change my mind that I didn't like this film at all.I just don't believe it myself that I watched this in the cinemas when it came out, and I liked it. Now going back to it just recently, I suddenly think it's one of the worst films I have seen in quite some time. The other thing which was weird throughout was that I found this film hilariously dumb and stupid. I mean I just made fun of this film after the first ten minutes. And then the middle sunk lower and then the ending was predictable and went absolutely nowhere. I mean throughout nothing exciting happened either.

James G. Robinson's Morgan Creek Productions joining forces with classic TV's immortal holiday icons, Rankin/Bass Productions, to fulfill a lifelong dream of R/B's co-founder, Arthur Rankin, Jr.that of bringing one of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's most legendary Broadway hits to the screen --- as an animated motion picture. Alas! The result turned out to be The King and I; and in its 1999 version, produced at Richard Rich's Rich Animation Studios in partnership with Nest Entertainment --- the creative team behind The Swan Princess --- there were quite serious flaws, the most important of which was unquestionably the simple truth that The King and I has, almost from the moment 20th Century-Fox's movie version of the Rodgers & Hammerstein legend was first released, pretty much been doomed to remain anathema among the people of Thailand, for whom the King of Siam is an historic figure worthy of being held sacrosanct. What, then, went wrong? Well, first things first, I believe that moviegoers went into this animated King and I expecting the awesome, unique, one-of-a-kind animation which for nearly forty years was at the heart of every Rankin/Bass Production. What the audience got instead, sadly, was a farmed-out, overly stereotypical, 90-minute exercise in badly done children's animation. Moreover, R/B's other co-founder had no involvement in this production. A Rankin/Bass Production without Jules Bass? Unthinkable! Even worse, Morgan Creek's recent filmography since Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, its biggest blockbuster ever (and, one would surmise, its ONLY such blockbuster), has spawned a series of less than incredible titles --- making one question why Warner Bros. continues to distribute Morgan Creek's films at all. But I have had access to the real story behind this failed 'toon; and, truth be told, it is at best a cautionary tale, and at worst a lesson in how not to bring a Broadway soundtrack to life on the screen. It seems to me that The Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, by arrangement with whom this film had been prepared, had wanted to support Mr. Rankin's dream; once the animated King and I flopped, unfortunately, it was clear that they could not support such a concept for any reason. Subsequent plans to animate other R & H stage legends --- Oklahoma! and The Sound of Music among them --- were ultimately scrapped, leaving Arthur Rankin, Jr.'s dream in tatters. To me, that's a shame --- because here was a unique opportunity to introduce younger audiences to the epic power and beauty that only a live stage show can provide.... an opportunity squandered through the addition of overly-cliched, racially stereotypical characters and Saturday morning-esque dialogue. I would guess, in the end, that the moral of this story is If you can dream it, don't always necessarily do it.... because you never know what kind of film-related traps you may stumble into in the end.

If the producers ever make another animation from R & H or another wonderful movie, I'm not going to see it.  I think that the changes are way too wild and beyond reality to make it a well directed and performed cartoon.  I agree that I give it a 1....no, a 2 because they at least kept in the most memorable songs.

As long ago as that was, his version is etched in my mind. For that reason I may have approached this abomination with my mind already made up.That notwithstanding, the following the animation was only passable. That has come to be the norm in cheap TV cartoons for five-year-olds, but a full-length feature based on a well-known story deserves better. Today's computer animation leaves no excuse for a two-dimensional, poorly-drawn screenplay.The voices are at odds with the drama -- either overplayed or under, rarely right on. Brynner could parody himself and get away with it. Vidnovic isn't up to the job. That said, his accent was enough like The King that it got me a couple of times. The singing is passable, but I swear I could hear the electronics occasionally.The liberties taken with the plot are unacceptable. They not only detract from and confuse the story line, they grate on the nerves. I suppose they thought only kids would watch this thing. In my own case, I wish they had been right.Rent the original.

The committee approach he's taken to shepherd this production robs the story of any coherent meaning or even consistent meaning. It would be kind to say it talks down to children, but that would mean adults would be able to understand it as well.  Impossible.   The characterizations are bland, and the animation is on par with the average TV episode of He-Man. The choices of vocal talent might have been OK if they'd been given anything interesting to say.

Much of the original has been replaced with a senseless story of a wizard and his fat henchman trying to kill the King so they can rule Siam.  All sorts of  `cute' characters have also been added here and we have plenty of scenes were monkeys and baby elephants hurl mangoes at the villains.   The movie has a number of astonishingly bad moments such as the scenes where the King flies over the kingdom in a balloon that is powered by a panther peddling a bicycle attached to a propeller.  Even worse is Anna singing `Whistle a Happy Tune' while being attacked by a sea monster!  With each scene I kept sinking deeper into my seat murmuring, `Tell me this isn't happening!'

To such a mentality I ask why not raise the children to the level of the art instead of lowering the art to the level of kids?

A woman comes to Siam to teach the kings children while someone who doesn't like the king tries to overthrow him. It's practically the normal idea of a kingdom trying to be overpowered and a king overthrown. There are some things though that just feels really stupid. For example, songs that are sung at the wrong times and the stupid evil sidekick who loses teeth. I never really liked the story of 'the king and I' because it was set with a lot of drama with a clash of cultures. I know it happens a lot and happened back then but they made it into a musical which is another reason I didn't like it. Now it being a cartoon helped me watch it for the rather fun comic affects.The animation is rather interesting, very similar to Asian style but with American cartoon flare. Sadly, the animation although fluid is a bit overboard on movement. Characters seem to move unnaturally most of the time, with flailing about and sometimes acting rather strangely for a human. It's funny to see the stupid sidekick with the belly that would move about but the rest of them were not supposed to be funny so I don't understand why everyone else had that same sort of style too. It just made the show feel awkward in that.The music is a little old fashioned and based on the live action movie with the same name. We have very stereotypical characters from way back when the book was made. It's not just the people who are Asian, it also goes for the old English characters. Just once I would like to see this done for our time frame where woman didn't wear hoop skirts and people were a little more educational (Just to let you know, I know they are smart but in a different manner. I am not racist.). The voices were alright though, fitting the characters well.Overall, I just didn't care for this movie much. While it is a fun show, it's not for everyone and felt bland to me.

However, the musical sequences are about all the film can flaunt. The colors are brilliant and vibrant and the animation pushing the music along is, for the most part, quite creative.  With the usage of dream sequences during I Have Dreamed... and colorful streamers in Getting To Know You, the animation takes a turn for a simplistic, yet entertaining presentation.  The advertised pieces are catchy, (although not as memorable as they used to be back in 1956 with Yul Brynner), but the glamorous Shall We Dance seems all too familiar to the Oscar-winning classic.Without the music, the film is a drab, poorly-written, mangled remake. The characters provide no motive for several of their actions, especially the villain who produces a menacing sea serpent which vanishes as Anna, the heroine, Whistles A Happy Tune.  The most devaluating element of the film, however, must be the villain's sidekick, an ignorant, tooth-losing sycophant.  He barely made the children within the theater chuckle, but rather made the audience embarrassed to have participated in such a catastrophe.  As in most animated features, the studios feel that there MUST be the addition of computer generated images to enhance the movie or to prove that they are as technologically advanced as the rest of the industry.  CGI hardly adds to this movie, in fact, it stands out like a sore thumb.  The ships and moving marble statues, all created by computers, are quite distracting and detract from the film's remaining dignity.Overall, the film deserves a RATING OF 5 based on its attempt at animating the classic musical sequences, no matter how poor the rest of the film developed.  It does, however, surpass the pathetic attempts of the recent DreamWork's The Prince of Egypt and 20th Century Fox's Anastasia.

What I see that I considered as the adult themes and contents in the 1956 version are 1.) Anna and The King (both portrayed by Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner) friendship turned into a complicated love affair. Plus, Tuptim cheating behind the King's back. TOO MUCH FOR CHILDREN! 2.) In the movie both Anna and The King talked about sexuality and other adult issues. Here's proof The King explains how he is the bee and the women are his blossoming flowers and Anna told The King to him, she is just another bowl of rice (like every other woman) well it's a long story . This is definitely Rated R.3.) The King has very many wives plus concubines and whole head of children (which explains you don't have to be a polygamous Mormon).

I thought Tuptim's man LunTha was a cutie pie too. You don't want your kids to have these weird thoughts about the characters, it is too early to think that way. Let them be young and not to grow them up to soon. 5.) Even though I am not a guy but I do have friends who are males that do enjoy this movie and some of them do say that Deborah Kerr and Rita Moreno were very beautiful and elegant and other things I don't want to explain. To see 1956 version I suggest you wait until your children hits 20 or 30 or probably 40, they can wait. I'm just kidding just as long as they are not eight or five (too early).This is good for the kids and kids only I thought this production (1999 version aka cartoon version) was playing it safe. They did a good job by changing some of the plots.Peanut Butter with Oreos are great, not! Drink Milk Last.

This woman, Anna, is a schoolteacher and has been sent to teach the king's children there. Someone has his eye on the throne, the Kralahome and his plan involves Anna, as well as the unsuspecting king&#133;Message You do not know everything.My thoughts I have watched this twice since we bought it recently and I like it about as much as I did when I was younger (when we borrowed it). I think this is underrated. Yes, it does have some slapstick and yes, it is a little untrue to the original film (which I also like but can't remember very well) and the real occasion two hundred years ago, but it is a well-animated, pleasant film with good songs from the original film! My favourite of all the songs is I Have Dreamed or whatever it's called. In the film, I also like the characters and the relationships between them, especially the prince's and servant's as well as Anna's and the king's. -) Recommended to People who would like a remake slightly more harmless than the original, people who like remakes and for people who like cartoon musicals! Enjoy! -) P.S I have just realised something weird. There are two cartoon musical remakes with a boy and a monkey, this and The Mighty Kong. Do the two directors have a connection between them of liking monkeys..?

EVERYTHING was a cliché.The Characters were clichés. Let's see, you've got The Noble But Naïve Man-In-Charge, The Evil Scheming Second-In-Command, The Evil Scheming Second-In-Command's Convenient Toady, the Know-It-All Lady (White, of course), the Witless Kid clichés, stereotypes, cookie-cutter characters ALL.The plot line was as predictable as a paint-by-numbers, connect-the-dots, or a jigsaw puzzle, except more so.As for the romance, you couldn't get more predictable than that. Set apart by class, family disapproval... again, complete cliché.Please, do me a favor. Surprise me. Have the king best the white lady once in a while. Have HER show some interest in what is right about Thai culture, rather than trying to correct it. Come to think of it, this movie was rather racist, with the white lady teaching the foreigners how to behave properly.The animation, well, it was comparable to animated films in days gone by... something in the 60s or earlier, to be exact. But 1999? Give me a BREAK.By the way, I think this movie was banned in Thailand because it made the King look ridiculous (A serious social sin over there, and I'm not being sarcastic or mocking). I don't blame them one bit.

Good idea to have the King's son a studly young Prince instead of another adolescent, like Anna's foppish brat Louis.  That frees up Prince C. to romance Tuptim instead of the dull Lun Tha, which makes the story a bit more personal and inter-related.  Banished, too, is the mopey matron Lady Thiang.  And the ballet Small House of Uncle Thomas tends to stop the show dead anyway.  Poor Eliza!  And of course (in Disney tradition) the King can't flatline, so the adventure finale is fine...But that's where my admiration ends and the litany of complaints begin...First, all those magical powers and mischievous animals are just plain idiotic.  Same with the Kralahome's bumbling assistant.  It's great that Anna's Whistle A Happy Tune quells the storm - but why does the storm have to be a magical curse?  And why, oh why, interpolate all that anachronistic dialogue (oddly reserved for the comic subplot only).  Cool?  Not!  In true Rankin/Bass style the animation is flat.  While most all R&H tunes survive (thanks to a huge 80 piece orchestra and a game cast), Anna's speaking and singing voices are obviously not the same.  And while it's a neat idea to open up Getting To Know You outside the palace gates, how does Anna (new to Siam) know her way around?  Presumably, kids don't use logic. It's interesting to think that the writings of a conniving widow named Anna Owens (her husband's name was Leon; she thought the new name more regal) has evolved from a diary indulged with fiction, to a non-musical film, to a sentimental stage musical, to a sentimental film musical, to this!  King Mongkut and Mr. Leon should be spinning in their graves.

It's true that liberties have been taken, and I'ts true that they've re-written parts of the story to allow for a happy ending. I have absolutely no problem with that, since we must remember that this is a movie intended for children, who can't understand many of the adult themes in the original story, like the harem, the 109 children, and the death of the king. For a story like this to work for children, you have to have new and exciting characters, and you absolutely have to have a great villain too. I thought the movie was just wonderful, and I loved the fact that they've used most of the music from the original. I firmly believe that this movie is not getting the credit it rightfully deserves. Two thumbs up for The King and I!
