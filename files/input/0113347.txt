[{"Title":"This Quilt of Intricately Woven Stories Warms the Soul","Date":"16 August 2005","Score":"22 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" When Berkeley graduate student Finn decides to spend some time away from her live-in boyfriend, and moves in with her grandmother and great aunt for the summer, while finishing her master's thesis, she gets an important and heart-warming lesson about love and commitment. Finn's grandmother and great aunt are members of a quilting bee, and their group (whose members have known each other for a long time) decide that their latest project should have the theme of where love resides. As the quilt is made, each woman remembers significant events in their lives which relate to love and the joy and pain that it brings. Each woman brings her own perspective to the nature of love, from Anna (who signs off on men completely after a bad experience)to her daughter Marianne (who cannot settle on just one man). Some of the women have been cheated on, some have done the cheating, while others just let love die.Along the way, Finn faces temptation in the form of Leon, a smoldering hunk who pursues her in spite of knowing that she is taken. At the same time, Finn must come to terms with her parents' failed marriage, as she decides whether to accept her boyfriend's marriage proposal.Inspite of the pains that the women have suffered in the name of love, the movie does not in any way bash love or marriage (which has recently become popular). It is a beautifully made film, and while it is definitely a chick flick, it might also appeal to the more romantically minded guy.

But Jocelyn Moorehouse obviously wanted to pack all the magic of the small stories of the women into this film, she wanted an entire quilt, full of bits and parts. It is only when understanding this that one can fully appreciate this wonderful piece. Fynn, escaping her partner and the life (marriage) probably unfolding before her, stays with her grandmother and -aunt for the summer. The serious young eccentric, a worried, messed-up hippie girl, confronts her future, her past and her present (dealing with gorgeous Johnathon Schaech chasing her with smiles and strawberries), when she dives into the life- and love stories told to her by the women in her grandmother´s quilting circle. The rest is magic. See the torture of love, the journeys of women and the revelations of grief and new beginnings, see what they hold dear, what will always stay with them, and learn what Fynn eventually comes to terms with That life is not about perfection, it´s about balance, about putting the small things together, just like a quilt. So, okay, mechanically, Moorhouse really doesn´t have enough time for subtlety, and some characters and developments literally just fly by without any diving in. This will lead people to saying it´s superficial, but it´s not It´s a journey, like looking out of a car window in another country Just peeks. Bits. Parts. Parts of a quilt the movie leaves you to put together. If you do, like I did, it´s so moving and inspiring. Warm. The music of THE one-and-only Thomas Newman, the beautiful Winona Ryder, the charismatic ladies, the land, full of secrets and peace. This is what makes it special. Fast, but special. And the final highpoint, a literal storm that blows everything apart yet puts everything together, is a cinematic masterpiece, proof of heartfelt, imaginative work of both the writer and the director. They´re actually dreaming an ending together - just take this lovely movie in and stop bickering about reality. If you ask me.

But it plods along, documenting the making of a wedding quilt that incorporates the lives of each person who contributes to it. Finn Dodd (what a hideous name), played by Ryder, at her tentative and mysterious best, is spending the summer with her aunts, while finishing her thesis. She is also engaged to Sam (Mulroney), who seems to get needier, as Finn seems to be getting coldfeet. The quilt is a gift for Finn's wedding, and is a labor of love among a group of women whose lives are intertwined in the northern California wine country, each of them sewing a panel that expresses the theme, Where love resides. But love resides in many different places among these women &#150; from sisters Glady Jo and Hy, entertainingly played by Bancroft and Burstyn, who are exactly the kinds of aunts anyone would like to have in their family, to the prickly Em (Simmons), and the unconventional Constance (Nelligan). So many different stories, as interpreted in quilting panels, do not always make a pretty quilt, and much negotiating and compromise is the very nature of putting the quilt together, as it is in life. Not Ryder's best work, but Burstyn and Bancroft are delightful as the pot-smoking aunts, rockin' out to Neil Diamond's Cherry, Cherry. Simmons is a pleasure to see &#150; with quite a lengthy career behind her, she doesn't appear often. Samantha Mathis is always charming &#150; it would be nice if things would really *click* for her career. Kate Nelligan is fabulous &#150; I was never able to abide her work, presuming her to be like the kind of tight-assed, judgmental characters that she portrayed. But I unexpectedly caught her in Frankie and Johnny (with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer), and could not believe I was watching the woman I had scorned for so long. Now I look forward to seeing her every time she appears. In spite of many fascinating and multi-faceted characterizations, this vehicle does not serve any of these actresses well. One expects Greatness out of such an enormous and worthy cast, but the Entertain-o-meter stops short of Just Okay, and one wishes that such talent had been applied to a script that utilized their collective talent better. The concept of the story revolving around this group-effort is a fine concept, but director, Moorhouse, has to work hard to keep the story from fragmenting into oblivion. Though not weighing in as a heavyweight, the multitude of fine performances ensures that it is fine entertainment on a lazy day.

I'm sure that there are many things to like about this movie and that somehow they escaped my notice.  For me it was never more than a series of plot devices stitched together (ha ha) to form an unsatisfying story.Winona Ryder is always a pleasure to watch.   I've liked her better in more irreverent titles like Beetlejuice or Heathers.   Still, she wears earnestness well, and manages to make bearable the Poloniusesque quilt speech at end of the picture (see the quotes section).The supporting players should be every bit as watchable (with several centuries of acting experience among them, they ought to be).  I wish I'd been allowed to watch them act.  Their function was to sit in front of the camera quilting  and say a few words of introduction before the flashback--as if they were hosts of a documentary.I want to pause for a moment over Maya Angelou's casting.  It's always a tricky thing introducing a famous person from another discipline as an actor.  I call it the Hey, you're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar problem (based on the scene from _Airplane_ where a kid recognizes the basketball player in the co-pilot's seat.   The joke is in how much time he spends denying it). Maya Angelou has screen presence, but does nothing to dispel the problem. My dominant experience watching her was, Wow, they got Maya Angelou, world famous poet!  Maybe this was the idea.  Maybe the filmmakers felt her famous presence would, in itself, add depth to the proceedings, so why muddy it with anything as messy as an interesting character?   Her appearance was less acting than promotion.  Maya Angelou wouldn't appear in a dog, would she?Well...The plot reminds me of a line Robin Williams had about alcoholics, You realize you're and alcoholic when you repeat yourself.  You realize you're an alcoholic when you repeat yourself.  You realize, oh dammit.  Each woman's story follows a similar pattern.  Girl meets boy, sleeps with boy, marries boy, boy leaves, boy comes back--each time unconvincingly (I wonder how far any guy has ever gotten with the opening line You swim like a mermaid).  The Alfre Woodard story is the only variation, and as a result, the only interesting one among them.And of course Winona Ryder's Finn has a similar problem.  Does she marry Dermott Mulrooney or does she go off with the local stud muffin.  I call him the local stud muffin because that's all he is.  The actor who played him didn't convince me that there was anything under the perfect I-don't-have-to-work-out abs that would compel her to do more than roll in the field with him.  He wasn't a character so much  a plot device meant to set up an obvious choice.  Handsome rogue or dependable architecht?  Given the way the flashbacks ran, take a guess.There are more scenes to pummel here.  There's the thesis blowing away in the wind (she's the only grad student I've ever seen with no notes, no paperweight, and, since she was using a typewriter, no carbons), and there's her random meeting with the Stud Muffin (who just happened to be hanging out in the groves with a picnic basket and a blanket for her.  I guess this was set before the advent of stalking laws), but it would take too long to mock them all.  The real trouble with the movie is that it was so earnest, so desperate to convince the audience of its poetic depths, that it wound up shallow, unsatisfying, unconvincing and unintentionally funny.Or, to put it another way--never have so many, who were so talented, worked on something so ordinary.

There is a glimpse of a couple who after their children are born, see their dreams fade and their marriage die. There is a short scene about a black girl who is seduced, left pregnant and abandoned by a white, rich boy visiting from college. But all of this heavy material is left up in the air. It is the sideshow to the main part of this film which is such a farce that is seems that the circus has come to town.Before I get to that, a few positive comments. American Quilt is beautifully made. The lighting, sets, costumes, camera work often create a magical atmosphere which is warm and comfortable. Another nice part is Winona Ryder who I praise for not being anorexic like so many young actresses. She is fine in her role. Maya Angelou also gives a good sometimes tough, stoic performance.Now the grim details. This movie centers around a young woman, named Finn, who has cold feet about getting married and so cheats on her fiancé. This part of the plot is so predictable. As soon as the handsome swimmer shows up, we know this will happen. Now Finn's mother is known to have a different man every month or so. So far this is plausible but there is much more. Now to Finn's grandmother. Grandma had an affair with her sister's husband while grandma's husband lay dying in the hospital. Now grandma and her sister live together. Only in Hollywood would these two elderly supposedly small town women light up a joint and puff away and live happily ever after even though one woman slept with the other's husband.What's really amazing is that this movie expects us to believe that this could happen twice in the same small town. You see the grandmother and her sister belong to a group of women who are making a quilt for Finn. Another woman is having an affair with another woman's husband. Two women have had affairs with two other women's husbands and they all get along in this quilting group. It's truly amazing. After being surprised and chuckling about all of this, I still tried to appreciate the better parts of this film. But what led me to give up hope is that just after Finn confesses that she has cheated on her fiancé, a violent wind comes, blowing her masters thesis out the window. Please, what is this the Ten Commandments? I can only feel sad when I see half of a good movie here wasted by being cobbled together with Hollywood nonsense. This is a lesson in how to make an American movie mess.

She begins to realize the many changes that will come about because of her acceptance to his proposal and needs time to think and adjust. She decides to spend three months at her grandma Hy's house in Grasse, CA, which is the center of operations to a longtime quilting bee. During her tenure, she continues working on her master's thesis (a project of which she continuously changes her topic), all the while listening to the quilting bee's romantic horror stories as they craft Finn's wedding quilt.To sum it up, `How To Make An American Quilt' is the quintessential chick flick awash with many familiar faces including Maya Angelou.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet stars as Anna, the queen of an eight-member sewing circle consisting of Glady Jo Cleary (Anne Bancroft), Hy Cleary (Ellen Burstyn), her daughter Marianna (Alfre Woodard), Em Reed (Jean Simmons), Constance Saunders (Kate Nelligan) and Sophia Darling (Lois Smith).  Anna winds up in the Cleary household at 16 - pregnant, unmarried and helpless.  She will dwell there until the birth of her child, meeting Hy and Glady Jo for the first time.  Little does she know that these two young women will remain in her life for years afterward, their interest and skill in the art of quilting mounting over the years by Anna's guidance.There is also the story of Hy and Glady Jo themselves and their unspoken bitterness towards each other - we learn that Hy is the reason for Glady Jo's `self-expression' all over the walls of the laundry room.  Then there is Sophia, an aspiring diver in her adolescence and later an abandoned mother of three; Em, wife to a histrionic artist, suffering his recurrent infidelity; Constance, a decent woman who endures the loss of her nearest and dearest, left with only her precious memories and Marianna, a lover of many but starved for the discovery of her soulmate.We find as the film goes on that many instances of infidelity exist in the characters' cluttered histories.  Half the women in this movie commit adultery at some point and even Finn falls victim to temptation. Where as once I could not relate, I find myself agreeing with many of Finn's thoughts and opinions on marriage upon becoming engaged - this includes a question in the very beginning that Ryder's voiceover poses to the audience `How do you merge into this thing called 'a couple', and still keep a little room for yourself?  How do we even know we're only supposed to be with one person for the rest of our lives?'  These kinds of questions number in the hundreds of intended couples as they come closer to walking the proverbial aisle.  I know that I have had my own reservations about marriage ever since I got engaged and many of my questions will never have an answer - I must trust my heart.and my gut.Performances range in the areas of premium to mediocre.  Who comes at the top of my list are screen veterans (and Academy Award winners, natch) Ellen Burstyn and Anne Bancroft.  These two never cease to amaze me with how they can turn a character inside out and make it their own.  Winona Ryder is so-so (as she is in most of her movies) as Finn but she does manage to touch a few nerves with her dark and luminous eyes - those pretty peepers are half of her dramatic capacity.  Alfre Woodard is excellent, giving Marianna a carved edge but a soft core.  Kate Nelligan is also wonderful but if you really wanna see her flex those acting chops, take a deep breath of Lila Wingo in `The Prince of Tides'.  Dermot Mulroney always seems to play a nice guy that gets taken for granted (The Thing Called Love, My Best Friend's Wedding, Point Of No Return, etc.) and he does it again here - actis repeatus, you might say.  Jean Simmons is a little disappointing as Em, the once beautiful and poised actress now only a shadow of herself.  Maya Angelou does fine as Anna and some of Gen X's more popular faces make brief appearances in supporting roles (Claire Danes, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto and Jonathan Schaech).This film is a fairly even script-to-screen production and will please many that seek a decent character study.  Of course, you can't outdo a detailed and poetic novel or the insightful author who writes it.  As long as novelists continue to exist and evolve, filmic adaptations cannot compare (though there are a few exceptions here and there, e.g. Dolores Claiborne). This is not to say that `How To Make An American Quilt' isn't enjoyable - it's just not on par with what can be translated through literature.  For those who have read Otto's novel, it will earn your rigid criticism.

Ryder is one of those few actresses who is able to relay a world of meaning in just her facial expressions alone. She's mesmerizing to watch onscreen.Added to Ryder's enchanting performance is Academy Award winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's beautiful, flowing images. There are many tiresome flashback sequences in this film, but they are all worth seeing just for the artistic value of the photography. Kaminski makes wonderful use of fluid camera movements and grainy filters to capture the essence of each time and place portrayed. It's no wonder Kaminski won an Academy Award for his work in Schindler's List and will most likely win another for Saving Private Ryan.Other than these elements, this film has very little going for it. The screenplay is muddled and jumpy, and there are far too many characters with far too many inconsequential flashback sequences that say very little about the nature of either love or commitment. The story concerns nothing more than a bunch of old women sharing completely one-sided and sexist sob stories. Like The Joy Luck Club and Waiting to Exhale, this film portrays men as little more than duplicitous, moronic, emotionally immature children who are incapable of either expressing true love or loyalty. It is a completely shallow look at adult human relationships and has nothing new or profound to say about anything.As a male supporter of feminism and feminist artistic expression, it saddens me that films like this are, first of all, even made, and then marketed as movies that modern women should see and even cherish. There are many far better films about women and their unique experiences, the most recent one being a small film called High Art, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and starring Ally Sheedy in one of 1998's best performances.

Well, sure - and I suppose most of us have been present at its death at some point in our lives, but I don't know that I want to have to be in on the autopsy afterward. Personally, as obviously true as the above statement from Finn may be, I'll still take 1 Corinthians 138 - love never fails. It sounds so much more hopeful! As for this movie, it was just a dismal portrayal of love, marriage - and men, who generally come across here as rather unlovable, adulterous and shallow twits.Much of the movie is told in flashbacks. Finn is a young college student writing a master's thesis who gets engaged and then promptly heads off to stay with her grandma and aunt and their friends for an entire summer while they make her wedding quilt. The movie revolves around the stories of the women's loves - and, for the most part, it ain't a happy story! They've all failed at love in one way or another (or, more usually, the men they loved failed them) and they end up getting poor Finn to the point of wanting to back out on her own wedding.From my perspective none of the performances here were particularly memorable (including Ryder's) and the characters not all that interesting or memorable. The movie ends with what appears to be some attempt at redemption, but you have to be able to stick with it long enough to get there, and then the redemption itself is a sort of qualified one as Finn ends her narration by essentially saying that she and her fiancé Sam might as well go through with this marriage thing because they have as much chance of succeeding as failing, and maybe their love will tip the scales ever so slightly on the success side of the scale. Isn't that heartwarming (or pathetic!) 2/10 (and I'm struggling to remember why I decided to go that high!)

It is also unusual in that it attempts to breach the generation divide in its appeal; however its success in this respect is debatable.      Finn is 26 and, hoping for some peace and quiet in which to complete her Master's thesis, she heads for her great-aunt's house in small-town Grasse, California.  She also needs time to mull over a marriage proposal from her boyfriend. This is an entrance cue for a smoulderingly handsome strawberry farmer (in an unnecessary plot complication) to hinder Finn's contemplations.        Great-aunt Glady-Joe lives with her sister, Hy, and their constant bickering is portrayed with sensitivity and humour by Anne Bancroft and Ellen Burstyn. The two sisters belong to a quilting group, who are in the process of creating Finn's wedding quilt - thematically titled 'where love resides'.  This evokes something different for each of the women, all of whom - in artificially contrived tete-a-tetes - explain to Finn the story behind their contributions to the quilt.  The viewer is transported to a time when these elderly women were young, and through them we (along with Finn) learn that times may change, but affairs of the heart will always be unpredictable.      These dalliances in the past are refreshingly piquant; unfortunately this is countered by the film's occasional heavy-handedness.  The symbolic crow that leads the women to their true love has all the subtlety of a flashing neon sign.  Ultimately however, even if it does perhaps tie up the loose ends too thoroughly, the film will leave the viewer pleasantly satisfied.

I like romantic and affecting movies, and can even support feminism if it's presented in the right way, but it was obvious right from the start that this film was aimed at the fairer sex; especially women who are 'survivors'.I felt totally excluded. An effort to try and make it appealing, regardless of what group you identify with, would have gone a long way.The only reason I tuned in initially was for a glimpse of the lovely Miss Ryder, most likely the source of that minimal male enjoyment I was talking about earlier. None of the cast particularly irked me, but then neither was I inspired.Ultimately, regardless of the argument about whether this film was made for men, women or both, there really should be no excuse for the direction to be so plodding. That, really, is its biggest sin, irrespective of whether feminist issues make you want to go and see the film, their treatment is leaden.I will doubtless watch the film again one day when I'm in a more forgiving frame of mind; but first impressions count for a lot, and I was NOT impressed.

Ryder is, as usual, kind of drippy. A little too cute to be your average Jo; it's hard for me to take her seriously.  In any case, the women's stories are usually interesting, but lack depth.  I'm sure the movie didn't do the original story justice.On the positive side, there is the nice use of flashbacks into different times and places; and I think this movie was just as much about how men relate to women as it was about women trying to deal with their men.This film also features Winona (once again) narrating herself; a technique that is beginning to wear on my nerves.  All in all, I was disappointed by the overall product; it was rather like a few intriguing patches being wasted in a pretty, but unimaginative quilt.

That distraction was of course the stories of the magnificent women of her grand-mom's quilt making beehive.One thing I didn't like though in the film was how self absorbed and immature the leading character is. I found my self at the end caring more about the secondary characters than Finn! One point in the film that shows how Finn really is as a character is when Sophia Darling brings her the lost pages from her thesis. There, Finn is so typical and indifferent that instantly drove me away from her. This is the only scene in the film where Sophia actually wants to say something personal, to open up, but Finn is actually rude. It's like she's saying to her OK, old lady. Thank you for bringing me the pages and telling me I am a good writer. However, this doesn't mean I have to pay attention in whatever you have the urge to say. Actually, I already know your bloody story and I find it just pathetic. Now buzz off and let me be! I don't have to say that from all the stories, of the quilting beehive women, I was both drawn and saddened the most by the one of Sophia.Life played her such an unfair game She wanted to became a diver and so she asked her beau to help her get out of that small town. But, as it usually happens, he got her pregnant instead and she had to get married and having to spend a lot of time home alone being a housewife. That totally killed her spirit and passion and left her a bitter old woman that blamed her husband for her life going wrong.Her husband (finally) realized that and made some efforts to get back together. He did that by building her a pond, in order to remind her her old free self. However, that ironically ended it all, since it was too painful for her to remember how she was (comparing to what she is). That was the saddest thing, to Sophia, since building a pond for someone who loved to dive was ironically sad and showed such lack of understanding, that it was almost disrespectful. And so they argued. She did try to make amends but it was too late. Her husband, partly because of disappointed and partly because of quilt, left her.And something last If you wanna watch more stories about americal quilts that hide really fascinating stories, then you must read the books in the Shenandoah Album by Emilie Richards.

It is not difficult to fall in love with the many characters and tales in this movie. From the tragic and beautiful tale of how Anna had her baby, Marie- Anna.

They fail to give the male players any depth, leaving them rather two dimensional.

Me, I want them to show a picture of the cast AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM, showing who's doing what. Unless you point to her and say, that's Ryder, I wouldn't know her at all.Of course, this movie answers the question can men and women be friends? I guess they can't if they are heterosexual, but I know gangs of gay men and women who are very devoted friends - mostly, because the women know they aren't going to be hassled-off-to-bed by the guys. If something happens, that's a plus. It also answers the question can ordinary people be faithful to their spouses, and that answer is announced with a blasting NO! We like to say it's women's lib or the liberally modern attitude for today. Heck, all of the great classics are about infidelity, huh? Just wasn't as blatant as it is today. This is demonstrated by the pretty swimmer-boy who was telecasting he would become more than friends - did you see that finger on her leg ??? I truly believe the empathy between Bancroft and whomever that other sister was is possible. Many more of that kind of relationship going-on that is known, or talked about. Perfectly believable they both would come to realize we are all too sexually riled-up and forgiveness makes life beautiful. Why some were surprised that the sisters smoked grass between them is more of that they're old syndrome younger people carry today - pot has been around for a long time ! I've watched this movie twice and kinda enjoyed it - the colors were nice for cinematography; I really didn't pay that much attention to the score. How can you praise the script and direction if you're disappointed in the finished product? Maybe I should read the book and let it go at that. If there were any great acting or promise of Oscars in this film, it all escaped me. I like talky movies, but these stories were far too undeveloped to make any impression. I was totally surprised that Maya Angelou found the perfect, young, black man at the end of the rainbow, then got pregnant by a white nincompoop. Was she just gettin' the air under that tree?

This sweet and touching drama is the story of these group of women who help Ryder through a rough batch as she decides whether or not to return to her fiancé (Dermot Mulroney). Ryder learns each of these women's stories, usually involving the men in their life, and each of those tales surrounding their influence in their parts of the quilting will be an influence for her as she discovers her own destiny.The Oscar Winning Burstyn and Bancroft are gems together as sisters, facing their own past as Bancroft married the love of Burstyn's life and watched the two of them fall back together. In spite of that, the bond between the sisters never bended, and influenced Bancroft, a powerful artist in her own right, to use her anger in her art in creating a special wall. The dignified Maya Angelou tells of her aunt's own quilt, which surrounded the crow that lead her to the love of her life. Esther Rolle has a powerful cameo in flashback as this aunt. Angelou then tells how she fell in love with the young white boy who left her pregnant and how this brought her into the lives of Ryder's family. The sweet Jean Simmons gives a poignant performance telling Ryder of how her artist husband couldn't help his own infidelities and how she came to accept him for who he was, but how destiny has changed her own plans. Then, Alfre Woodard, as a spunky Haitan woman, tells of how she never allowed herself to become trapped by a man, something she sadly regrets but realized was beyond her control.Each of these women have something powerful to offer, but perhaps the most powerful of these characters is the former champion diver played by stage legend Lois Smith who is both feared and admired in the community and gets a great final scene to show how far she has come. A terrific ensemble in a lightly plotted drama shows that less can be more in creating terrific art.

Ryder is very appealing as well. The weakness of the movie is Ryder's men. Both are very underdeveloped. Mulroney is just bland, while Schaech's character is completely defined by his well sculptured body.

It's sad to see Jean Simmons, who was once a fine actress as well as an intriguing, voluptuous beauty, reduced to this; on the other hand old actresses only get better the problem is there are so few parts for them, and it's hard to bare all those wrinkles. Ditto for the other Grand Dames here who fret about and wallow in their past loves while spying lustily on the loves of others.I saw this to study Winona Ryder's face. She plays Finn Dodd, a Berkeley grad student writing her thesis on the lives of the quilt makers while debating a marriage proposal. Sometimes she seems to be posing, and at other times I find her as subtle and as natural as a great actress. As beautiful as she is, I found myself wondering if her interpretation of a selfish and duplicitous young woman was more a projection of her own true heart than a demonstration of any acting skill. She certainly doesn't give the slightest hint that she cares about the loves and heartaches of the quilt makers she seems totally absorbed in present titillations and in the working out of the pre-matrimonial angst. But it may be that that is the reality of who her character is, and if so Ryder plays her to a perfect fit.Totally captivating is scene in the orange grove where the 26-year-old Finn gets laid by mesomorphic Leon who provokes her to a swooning imitation of a Victorian maiden being touched for the first time. (Winona's face is very sexy.)In a sense the Darwinian nature of the human animals depicted here is correct, and on that level director Jocelyn Moorehouse is having a good laugh on all of us. Her assertion is that what humans really practice is serial monogamy, an insight from evolutionary psychology increasingly accepted these days. Her answer to the vexing question, Can men and women be friends? is clearly no. From a woman's point of view-and this film is clearly from a woman's POV-I suspect she is correct.The quilt symbolizes the human institutions and the social and political bonding that enable women to collar their animal nature and live in harmony with others.Memorable are the oaks and the orange groves and the rolling hills of the California countryside; a black crow that hops; a wind devil that tumbles a white plastic chair and blows the pages of Finn's thesis out the door; and an old Ann Bancroft stoned on marijuana and cognac.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Let me preface this by saying that it isn't that this film doesn't have a high powered cast of fine actresses. It does. It's not that the direction isn't completely competent and appropriate for this sort of sentimental subject matter. It is. My complaint about HTMAAQ is its total embrasure of traditional gender roles and the message it sends to young women.Basically, smart and sexy but confused young Finn (the always-appealing Ryder) has a decision to make Does she finish her Ph.D and enter the world of academia, or marry her nice-but-slightly-chauvinistic longtime boyfriend, who is VERY anxious for the baby action to begin? Well, this is a Hollywood picture made during one of our most conservative decades, so don't you just know what that decision will be?Finn spends the summer listening to the narratives of her grandmother's little coffee klatch. These stories mostly involve how their lives were made better by men (even the really nasty ones), marriage (even the unhappy ones), and of course childbirth. These yentas manipulate our Finn something fierce, and when a huge wind from nowhere (or is it God?) blows the pages of her dissertation all over town, Finn sets out and finds...her devoted man just a-waitin' for her. At movie's end, Finn presumably decides it's time to fergit all about that there professorin', settle down and have some babies.The problem with this film is obvious. It sends the strong message that women depend on men for their personal growth and very self-definition, and hints strongly at that oldest of lies, the inherent superiority of full-time-wife-and-mommyhood. In all, HTMAAQ is romantically filmed, well acted and doesn't require a lot of critical thinking. Pat Robertson couldn't have come up with a better infomercial for our culture's barefoot and pregnant ideal for women. I give it my Golden Barbie Award for gender stereotypes and utter vapidity.
