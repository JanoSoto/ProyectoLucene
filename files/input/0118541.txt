This is a good film. Nothing special or brilliant, but it does what it sets out to do which is to make you laugh - and it does so much better than most films of its kind.I started watching this expecting to change channels quite quickly. I only gave it a chance at all because Joe Pesci was in it - which is never a bad asset for a film. What happened was I found myself smiling quite a lot, and then laughing quite a lot. Not uproariously or uncontrollably. But out loud, and more than once.Pesci is good - but so is just about everyone else. And the script is wickedly funny too. It's much less predictable than most of its kind, There are twists which are genuinely surprising and interesting, and the film stays pretty fresh (even though in truth it's probably 20 minutes too long).I'm quite a harsh marker, so a 6 from me is quite a compliment for a film like this. Well-written, nicely-paced, silly without being annoying, and containing some funny performances and a lot of good moments, you will like this one if you give it a chance.

Of course on the airport his bag is switched with another one.Not all the gags and jokes are good. There are some very predictable and embarrassing ones. Not only embarrassing for a great actor like Joe Pesci, but also for the guy who came up with them. However, there were some terrific ones as well, the best perhaps is the dream sequence.

Pesci tortures two of Cameau's college buddies while Cameau and his girlfriend deal with the eight heads. Plot boils down to chasing about eight heads and attempting to replace them. Director Tom Shulman seems to be quoting from old style comedies but fails to provide a payoff. A dream sequence involving singing heads is inventive but perhaps another director could have brought greater substance to it. Pesci is a capable actor but his satire take on his gangster roles are hardly inspiring here, and the ending painting him as some sort of nice guy is revolting. Andy Cameau is embarrassing as he and his girlfriend, played by Kristy Swanson run about aimlessly to solve this sick dilemma.

I guess you just have to go with the concept here the same way you go in to see something like Snakes on a Plane or Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter. The idea is just so far fetched that you have to see it through to see how it all plays out. Joe Pesci is the right guy to pull off something like this, he's a lot like the character Tommy DeVito he portrays in 1990's Goodfellas. His name is Tommy here too, so maybe he's the same guy, who knows? He's got a scene here that reminds me of yet another oddly titled flick, Throw Momma From the Train when he heaves George Hamilton's mother out of the car for being a bit overbearing. Look, no one's going to confuse this with being a great movie in any way but it's relatively entertaining if you like Pesci and his wise guy manner. With George Hamilton and Dyan Cannon both pushing sixty when the film was made, you have to admit they made a fine looking couple. Story continuity takes a bit of a beating as the picture progresses but I don't think that's what one looks for in a picture with a title like this. So don't even bother wondering what ever happened to George Hamilton when the picture ends.

They will ask themselves, Why does the tone of the movie keep changing? Sometimes the movie is a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's high-energy farce. Sometimes (actually, most of the time), the movie's tone is kind of flat. I'm not sure why the tone kept changing. Maybe it was a consequence of the lower budget - although the movie never looks seriously cheap, it has the appearance of being hastily shot with not much thought put through it. (And while most of the movie is set in Mexico, it's pretty obvious that it was not shot there.) However, even if a more consistent tone had been generated, the movie would still suffer from a screenplay with a number of flaws. Although Pesci's character has a deadline, he obviously goes past this deadline with no consequences. The movie keeps dropping plot elements and bringing them back after a long time has passed. There are plot holes, and the last third of the movie, when all the characters are together, becomes somewhat confusing.I will admit that I did laugh a few times, mostly at Pesci's behavior and one-liners. And it's nice to see George Hamilton in a major studio movie again, though he is mostly wasted. But while the movie's flaws didn't aggravate me greatly, at the end I muttered ehhhh to the 95 minutes I had just watched.

The movie, therefore, was too light for a good dark comedy (give me Very Bad Things, or Dr. Strangelove any day of the week), and too dark to appeal to the mass audience.  It will only appeal to a small segment of the population.For instance, when the heads start singing Mr. Sandman in a dream sequence, it is too ridiculous not to laugh, yet too disgusting for many.  Another aspect of the movie that I did not like was Pesci's character had a conscience.  He is supposed to be this hard-boiled criminal, but has a heart of gold?

At this young, tender age I innocently believed that all comedies were created equal. If a film wanted to make me laugh, it would make me laugh - no questions asked. Truth be told, I can't even remember why I rented it. Perhaps it was because Joe Pesci was in it; if he was funny in HOME ALONE, then surely he'd be funny here. And the movie would be a blast as well.As it turned out, I was right on only one count. Pesci is wonderful in 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG, playing his sadistic mobster shtick to the hilt. However, a little bit of Pesci goes a looooong way halfway into the picture, I realized that his brand of dark comedy had seeped into every comic situation, rendering the movie a sordid mess.I have nothing against dark comedy, but 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG doesn't so much push the envelope as rend it asunder. There is so much vulgarity and mean-spiritedness that I actually began to pity the characters, trapped as they were in their little 1950s sitcom universe from Hell.Joe Pesci notwithstanding, every character in this movie is a loathsome stereotype. We have the naive young man, the squeamish girlfriend, the clueless father, the ditzy wife, the crotchety old grandma, etc. And let's not forget all those hot-blooded Italians and sneaky Mexicans.There was one - only ONE - point where I really surrendered myself to gales of joyful laughter. It was the great comic set-piece wherein Pesci's mobster is asleep and dreams that the eight severed heads of the movie's title come to life and begin singing Mr. Head Man (to the tune of Mr. Sandman) like seasoned recording artists. Then their headless bodies crash through the wall and begin to strangle our hero. I laughed my proverbial butt off at this surreal comic masterpiece. Then the scene ended - and I went back to being not amused again.At the end of the movie, one of the characters tries to make up for nearly two hours of bleak vacuum by spouting a barrage of head puns (Stop a-HEAD, Anyone need to use the HEAD?, etc.) and other corny jokes, some of which were, admittedly, quite clever. But, as they say, it was too little, too late.On a scale of 1-8 heads, I give 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG a small section off the smaller ear of the smallest head in Tommy Spinelli's bag.

Although this movie reminded me of both, but in here it's one hell of an original one where the rhythm is highly hot, the backgrounds are nice, the atmosphere is like everything  masterfully light. (Joe Pesci) is on the top of his game, how he looked so charismatic more than ever, and of course his comic performance is flawless. All the rest presented their best despite that they all weren't as good as the lead. Maybe the music wasn't creative inasmuch as traditional which mostly done nothing but overstating the performance, the ending was that unconvincingly fast, and of course the matter of being disgusting.. However it's the late 1990s ! So after a cinematic history of hunting a duffel with important papers, diamonds, money, or anything polite.. It's about time to chase heads (god knows what could be chased after, but I can wonder !). (Robert De Niro) is being spoofed in here at the scene of (Are You Talking to Me ?), and nothing is odd since (Pesci) spoofed himself in here also where he was smashing any payphone like his character in (JFK &#x96; 1992). The only thing to complain about that when (Joe Pesci) is talking about retirement afterwards from being a gangster he really did it yet as an actor in real life ! As he didn't make something during the next 11 years except (Gone Fishin' - 1997), (Lethal Weapon 4 - 1998), and a guest appearance in one very short scene at (The Good Shepherd - 2006) directed by (De Niro). The smartest of it all  (Pesci) throws the nasty blabber mother-in-law out of the van over the mountain, it's classical as it seemed like everyman's dream of any unstoppable nagger comes insanely true !, seeing (George Hamilton) without his famous hair at the closing credits, another dream comes true. The musical nightmare of the heads singing a sick version of Mr. Sandman, that summarizes the whole beauty of it. True that in movies' stories nothing is totally original though here the plot definitely was, along with the wonderful condition that this movie leaves you with.

Pint-sized Joe Pesci of Goodfellas plays Tommy, a combustible, crew-cut, wise-guy who must deliver a duffel bag of eight heads to a vengeful crime boss. Basically, the mob chieftain insists on verifying the contents for himself. Andy Comeau co-stars as a clean-cut college kid named Charlie, with a duffel bag of duds, bound for a weekend in Mexico with his cute girlfriend Laurie Bennett (Kristy Swanson of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and her stuffy parents. Dyan Cannon and George Hamilton play Laurie's mother and father Annette and Dick Bennett. Tommy and Charlie take the same flight out, sit next to each other, but don't hit it off. Guess whose bags do the duffel shuffle in all the airport chaos. When Tommy learns he has snagged the wrong bag, he heads off for Charlie's college fraternity house. He tortures Charlie's two pin-headed med school pals Ernie (David Spade) and Steve (Todd Louiso) who cannot tell Tommy a thing because they know nothing about Charlie's plans. How much laughter can you generate from of a scene where a thug snaps a wet towel at two naked frat boys? Meanwhile, in Mexico, David's future mother-in-law, Annette Bennett (Dyan Cannon of Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice) discovers the grisly contents of the bag and turn into a basket case. Charlie and his girlfriend try to lose the heads, but nothing they do works. Thieves steal Dick Bennett's truck fro them, and a coyote snatches one of the noggins. Dick winds up in a Mexican hoosegow after two heads show up in his baggage at the airport. Eventually, just as Tommy is about to snuff the frats, Charlie calls. Charlie and Tommy agree to get their heads together. By this time, writer & director Tom Schulman has devoted half of the movie to time spent in Mexico on the labored comedy of characters up to their ears in head games. The lowbrow plot gets even more complicated and less humorous. Tommy finds out that Charlie might have let a couple of heads roll, so he forces Ernie and Steve to help him come up with two replacement craniums.While all of this is happening, two more mob guys trail Tommy across the border. It seems that the headstrong crime boss is pretty head up waiting for his heads. Bennett's mother, a chain-smoking battle ax, shows up, too. The trouble with 8 Heads is that Schulman spends too much time bringing Tommy and Charlie together. A good comedy of errors depends on nimble timing, witty humor, and a snappy story. 8 Heads squanders too much time on plot filler and gets a little too mean-spirited, particularly when Tommy spews profanities galore. The confusion that guillotines the best laid plans of the heroes rarely elicits a laugh. Tommy looks like a headbanger who wandered in from a Martin Scorsese bloodbath.You know you're in trouble at a comedy when the movie allots more time to the exposition than the gags. You know you're watching an empty-heded comedy when the movie characters resort to jokes about the film. You know the movie-makers are desperate when the resort to a dream sequence. They have the heads warble a tune in Tommy's dreams, while their headless bodies attack him. Pretty soon you notice, too, that the laughs get to be fewer and far between. When one of the characters suggests a better plan than what the writer gave to the star, you know you're in a bad movie. Charlie criticizes Tommy for not flying the heads out on a privately chartered jet. Sure, the heads would arrive intact, but there would be no comedy. Anyway, it shows what a numbskull Tommy is. You'd at least mark your bag if you were toting around severed body parts, right?Compared with the wise guys that he impersonated in Goodfellas and Casino, Pesci's errand boy Tommy is just plain cranky. He loves to smash phones and brandish his giant automatic pistol. Tommy makes a terrible hero because he's never sympathetic and he is much too stupid. Indeed, it is fun to see a couple of 1960s era stars like Cannon and Hamilton co-star in a 1990s film, but they're wasted in stereotypical supporting roles. Hamilton phones in most of his lines to his mother, trying to persuade her not to visit their motel. Spade sleepwalks through a role that demands very little of his enormously dry talent.8 Heads in a Duffel Bag belongs to the corpse comedy genre. Even Weekend at Bernie's 2 was one head and one body about this multi-cranical farce. Pesci fans will wonder why he gave his nod to this skullduggery.

You should also see Gone Fishin for that matter.

He's just as funny as ever here, but the material he uses is not quite as funny as it could and should have been.  Joe Pesci plays a gangster named Tommy Spinelli, whose current job is to deliver the heads of eight powerful gangsters to a man in San Diego who will accept them as evidence that their owners are dead.  Unfortunately, Pesci's duffel bag is switched at an airport with an identical bag owned by Charlie (Andy Comeau, who is heading to Mexico for vacation with his fiancee. What he doesn't know is that his fiancee, Laurie (Kristy Swanson), is no longer sure she wants to marry him. Under the influence of her alcoholic mother (Dyan Cannon) and deeply tanned father (George Hamilton), she has changed.  Spinelli has exactly 24 hours to find the eight heads. Using clues in Charlie's bag, he visits Charlie's fraternity house and tortures two of his frat brothers (David Spade and Todd Louiso) to find out Charlie's vacation plans. (Which is a funny scene, in which Spinelli makes the two kids put on their stethoscopes and bangs the metal pieces together, hurting their ears. Needless to say, they talk.)  Meanwhile, in Mexico, Charlie has discovered the heads in his bag. Spinelli and the fraternity brothers fly to Mexico for the climax, which involves at one point a bunch of heads along with arguing about whether it's murder if you thaw out a cryogenically-frozen person. Joe Pesci holds this movie together on his own. The other characters don't seem to be very dimensional, and while Pesci's Spinelli isn't as deep as, say, Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas, his streak of humor makes up for this.8 Heads in a Duffel Bag should have worked better than it does. On (most) occasion(s) the laughs cease to exist, but when they are there, they can be quite funny, if a bit contrived.

These simple basics, that already were the inspiration for many lame comedies, are completed with further slapstick story lines like the hunt for replacement heads (when some of the original go missing), neurotic mothers-in-law and dumbass mafia guys. The first 15 minutes are so filled with delightful black humor and witty one-liners (Joe Pesci is in great shape) that they give you impression you're in for a swell comedy. Unfortunately, 8 Heads in a duffel Bag quickly turns into an overly hectic and unoriginal time-waster, better fit for TV. Joe Pesci can act like his old self again completely and who else could portray a loud-mouthed mob courier?
