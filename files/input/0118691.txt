Secondly, everyone who gave this movie a bad rating needs to stop rating movies altogether.  What's not to like about this movie that is charming, cute, innocent, and funny??  Fran Drescher may have been type-casted right off the Nanny, but who cares!!???!!  What did you expect her to act like in the film!?!  Were you expecting an oscar worthy performance!!!???  Did you think she was the next Gwyneth Paltrow, or Julianne Moore???  If you saw the previews and have half a brain, you would have known exactly what to expect.  I had no expectations for this movie (nor should anyone have) besides a good laugh.  And that's exactly what it delivers.  Fran is absolutely perfect for the role of Joy Miller and she is even more charming and funny in this movie than Sandra Bullock is in Miss Congeniality (another great movie by all accounts, and I'm not downing the always fantastic Sandra).

Her character Joy Miller is the Nanny all over again...but this time she has been hired (mistakenly) to teach the four children of a eastern-European dictator.  She has amazing comic timing and plays well of off co-star Timothy Dalton, who is a wonderful President of Slovetzia, the tiny (made-up) country that most of the movie takes place in.  He is at once a pompous and loveable character...his transformation from Beast to Man is a delight to watch.  The plot is a mixture of The Sound of Music, The King and I, Beauty and the Beast, and a kind of twisted Cinderella...but it all meshes together for an endearing (though very predictable) movie.  A change from Tim Dalton's usual dramatic/spy movie genre...who knew he could be so funny?

She brings the trademark we know so well to the movie - her nasal voice and pre-occupation with the trivial stuff, but she also brings a kind of sensitivity we've never seen before in the Nanny series.I quite like some of the scenes - how she teaches the kids what she knows (airline miles), the massage scene, the home-coming, and a lot of others that just seem to be made just for her.

It has the usual mushiness and fluffiness that other American rom-coms have (although this one is set in Eastern Europe) and it's accompanied by a nice soundtrack. However, what really sets this one apart is the delightfully funny Fran Drescher. Her character is no different from her unique persona as Nanny's Fran Fine but even so, her wit, charisma and comic timing are perfect. Those who find her annoying in 'The Nanny' would most likely hate this movie but for me, this actress makes it somewhat likable. Timothy Dalton as the beautician (just kidding) is quite adequate (his fake accent is hilarious) and both actors share a good chemistry. The rest are just okay, mostly gap fillers. There is nothing path-breaking about this movie but if one is a fan of Ms. Drescher then why not give this a try if you've got nothing else to lose?

Those outfits (in Joe's chauvinistic voice) OH, YEAH!!! That big '80's hair. And that voice (except when she got whiny)??? Uh-huh-huh! Uh-huh-huh!The Nanny was a good show, though not great. It was raunchy and funny, though, to me (and maybe this is me being more old-fashioned than I'll admit), raunchy sex jokes do not go together with family entertainment. Thus, I was always convinced that it was in a bad time slot. NBC doesn't show Law & Order at 800 (or 700 if you're in Mississippi like me).Nitpickiness aside, when I heard that she was doing a movie titled The Beautician and the Beast, I was quite skeptical. I didn't think that it would be any good. But I sucked up any doubts I had and saw it anyway.I have to admit that, while it's not the best, it's not the worst, either. I actually liked this movie. Granted, the movie is VERY dated (for the most part, Communism is dead), quite predictable (can you say The Nanny?) and can get downright stupid (what's with the chicken?).But it can also be funny, like when Joy, Fran's character, gets the workers to strike, in the tradition of Norma Rae, thus angering Boris Pochenko, played adequately by Timothy Dalton. And there were a lot of raunchy references to her relatives, i.e. one of her aunts having to have facial hair removed. And, without giving anything away, I thought the begining was really cute as well.Not to mention that I was really impressed with a scene near the end of the film where she stands up to Boris. To me, it sounded as if she was really acting, speaking past her quirky voice and speaking the lines with gusto. That may explain how she got a part in a Woody Allen movie, even if it's a bit part.This film isn't for everybody, especially if you're put off by Fran's voice. And, though there are no sex scenes, there are benign sexual references, not to mention mild language. Others might say bring the whole family, but I wouldn't. While *I* think she's funny (like I said before), I believe her humor is too raunchy for family entertainment. And some of her humor deals with generalizations, which may explain why you don't see her being compared to Julia Roberts, Jennifer Lopez or Rene Russo, strong women who aren't afraid to be one of the boys.

Fran showed more depth of character and independence in this movie than she did (or was allowed to do) in her TV series. Throughout, she is pretty and sexy and dressed to catch attention.

I suppose this all pretty well explains why I enjoyed The Beautician and the Beast.Fran plays almost the same familiar role, except instead of Mr Sheffield we have President-for-Life Pochenko of Slovetzia (Tim Dalton). He's an old school dictator and a disciplinarian as a father; however, she eventually captures his heart and gets him to change his ways. His oppressed children love her, of course. Think of Maria and Capt von Trapp. None of it is realistic, but that's part of the movie's charm. It has the same kind of humour as the television show, plus a good deal of gentle ribbing of Slavic countries and dictatorships. I watched the film on TV in Croatia, so I don't think they mind.I see this movie is rated rather poorly here on IMDb.com. It also didn't do well at the box office. Don't let this influence your decision to watch it. If you like The Nanny, you'll enjoy this movie too.

One evening, the classroom catches on fire and Joy saves the day, hustling everyone out of the building. Her beautiful picture ends up in the local papers. It just so happens that a minister from the eastern European country of Slovetzia is looking for a teacher for the ruler's children and he hires Joy, not realizing that she teaches cosmetology alone. Only after the two of them land in Slovetzia does the truth come out. Never mind, Joy tells the public servant, she will do her best to teach those kids. The country's leader, Boris (Timothy Dalton), however, is a no-nonsense guy who rules his family and his country with an iron fist. Indeed, Slovetzia is depressingly similar to the Soviet Union at its worst. Boris is struck by Joy's charm and beauty but insists there will be no goofing off in the classroom. The children are sweet but one daughter, especially, longs for a bit more freedom. Can Joy bring a touch of democracy and levity to the dismal country? This darling little film will please both fans of romantic comedy and those who love Drescher. If The Nanny was your cat's meow, you will adore this film that came out years before, for it is strikingly similar. Indeed, Drescher and Dalton make a dynamite combination and are very pleasing. The rest of the cast is adequately pleasant. The costumes, especially Drescher's, are quite nice and the scenery and ruling palace are lovely. As for the script, it is funny and touching and the direction has energy. Therefore, if you love those comic tales of affection, skip the beauty parlor and head to the video store instead. You can get your hair done another day but you need this little jolt of sunshine, on film, immediately.

To watch them is like watching Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in I Love Lucy. Especially when Boris (Dalton) speaks in bad sounding English and Joy (Drescher) mimics him. Dalton's transformation from beast to 'prince charming' is, as always, believable. He also gets the laughs and looks yummy at the same time. Fran is also in her element, because in a movie such as this (vs the sitcom 'the Nanny') she gets a chance to show us her serious side--and she is as believable as when she's zinging those classic comic one-liners. The movie also shows off Dalton's ferocious and highly energetic fencing skills, which is another trademark of his. The high tension built up by Dalton is only brought down by Drescher's light-heartedness and wit. It plays out extremely well with more confrontations to come. And, there's no swearing!Laughter is the best medicine to beat the blues. So, I say enjoy the fairy-tale it's meant to be and get ready to laugh out loud.

However, after actually watching it I found it to be surprisingly good. Fran Drescher plays Joy Miller who is a beautician in New York City. Timothy Dalton is Boris Pochenko, a brutal tyrant of a small Eastern European country (Slovetzia) who has mistakenly hired Joy to teach his four children. His Prime Minister, Leonid Kleist (played by Patrick Malahide), insures that Boris rules with an iron fist. Joy arrives and becomes instrumental in introducing much needed change. More importantly though, she changes Boris for the better as well. Now, while this plot is extremely predictable, the comedy is anything but that as there are many surprises written into the script that are simply hilarious and I think the writer (Todd Graff) deserves a lot of credit for this. Likewise, even though Fran Drescher was nominated for a Razzie Award for her performance, I can honestly say that it was totally undeserved. I found her performance to be both witty and refreshing. I also liked the way she and Timothy Dalton worked so well together. The massage scene in particular was especially amusing. In closing, I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie and well worth the time spent.

I am also a big fan of Fran Drescher! I miss seeing her more often also. She is so beautiful and such a talent - and so very good at being funny. Neither of them disappoint in this movie. They are wonderful!Life is so full of stress, sadness, loss, tragedy now, more light hearted, comedic movies like this are needed sandwiched in to take us away and be entertained in fantasyland for a while.

Neither does Oz, Narnia or MiddleEarth.****THEN SOMEone was pretty critical of Timothy's accent being very bad; Timothy does nothing bad, including accents. BUT, IF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T EXIST, HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE ACCENT IS BAD??? I thought it was wonderful.

Its touching, worrisome at times...and cute, I swear she gets the most precious expressions.-With all due respect and targeting no one in particular, it seems in our world today many people have become so jaded they can't enjoy a great, light hearted hilarious romantic comedy that is CLEAN, without calling it cheesy or corny. IT IS NEITHER. I choose not to believe in those concepts. People have just gotten so much more afraid to show emotion and care for each other and we need more of that and perhaps more movies like this would unconsciously encourage it.Timothy is at his usual flawless best, playing both sides of the ill tempered dictator, whose ego seems large enough to have its own zip code you can't get to from here; and who thinks things are just hunky dory with his people, but are they?; to his other self -the gorgeously handsome man,with that deep sexy voice, which is more apparent when he isn't yelling or fussing about something.(And I HAVE to say he is handsome both with mustache and sans mustache). I think the movie is written very well, and when he first starts to become- challenged by Joy Miller's lessons for HIM, and goes out amongst his people - well, just wait and see-its truly a priceless, clueless moment for him, (We get to watch him as Tim pulls the cluelessness of this guy off SO well, chest puffed up, strutting, smiling and waving as if he does it every day...) And quite a shock for the people.Fran is terrific and gorgeous too, and I think the pairing of those two was sheer genius and they make a beautiful couple in heart, spirit, and yes,look. I know I was jealous of lucky Fran AND the mythical couple and it took me away to that place all women who love romantic stories love to go - where YOU are the female lead character!This is a GREAT MOVIE AND ITS NOT JUST A CHICK FLICK EITHER, GUYS - if you like comedy I recommend it to you also and there IS Fran.

I have only watched five minutes of the pilot episode of the nanny, as well as the closing minutes of a number of episodes and have decided that I don't particularly like it. The Beautician and the Beast is basically the Nanny made into a movie, with a few things altered. She isn't sacked from a beauty parlour, but is brought into the home of a really rich man (actually an Eastern European dictator) as a nanny. The movie is quite funny in parts but a really do not think much of Fran Dresure (sp?), especially how I heard the comment that her character in this movie is exactly the same as her character in the nanny.This movie makes numerous assumptions about 'decadent American society' in which it destroys. Rather it attacks the eastern European dictatorship and makes America look like a wonderful place. The promiscuous American is destroyed with Fran's character she is not interested in guys until the right one comes along, and it is obvious that it was going to be Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), and as the movie draws to the close the idealistic Hollywood ideal of love is emphasised in the most sickening way.The movie blatantly has a go at how these communist nations allegedly altered history to suit themselves. Stalin allegedly did this to make him look like he was really close to Lenin when he was not. America subtly does this with their claims that World War 1 started in 1917 and World War II begins in 1942, the years they became involved in both wars. This is done more as a joke than as an attack, because now communist has gone and everybody can live happily in the marvelous freedom that a democracy brings. Yet Fran is extremely cynical about democratic politicians as she quotes they're politicians, you can't trust them. Beautician and the Beast is really a remake of Sound of Music with the music replaced with comedy. The movie blatantly steals from the original with the clothes made out of sheets. There are a lot of similarities, a nanny coming in to take care of a very powerful man's children. In Sound of Music he was a Nazi commander while in this movie he is a communist dictator.The last interesting thing to note is when Pochenko is addressing the peasants from a balcony. They scream and cheer at his words. He then walks into the building and Joy Miller (Fran Desure) walks out and thrusts her arms into the air and the crowd cheers. This strikes Pochenko with the fact that it is not him that they cheer, but rather anybody who stands there. Fear is thrust onto people whereas respect is earned.

It's very clean cut, and innocently funny with no sex jokes or anything like that.  It's light hearted and leaves you with a smile on your face.  So, for families who do have Family Night, rent this one.  It's something the whole family can enjoy! o) "},{"Title":"The Nanny goes to Eastern Europe","Date":"28 July 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  The Nanny is a great sitcom and I love it.  But this movie was just The Nanny set in Eastern Europe.  Predictable but cute.  I liked Timothy Dalton's character because it was a different look at him.  The character was gruff but he played him a comic twist which he looked like he enjoyed.  I would like to see Fran Dresicher in something besides The Nanny especially since the series in now over.

I would say it wasn't the best movie but it ain't the worst movie either.  It is not that exciting to watch and it not a show I can watch over and over again.  But over all it's an okay movie.  I would recommend you to watch this show just once and see if you like it.

She takes the job of teacher to a despot's children, and all the predictable jokes and  predicaments follow neatly in their prescribed order. I've seen worse, but it wasn't a very watchable film.

She'll re-mould him from being a stere0typical stuffed shirt and everyone will love her. The kids will fall in love with her and she'll be their rock. Eventually the dictator will stop living in denial and finally marry her, go through a few formal embarrassing situations and in the end they'll have boy and girl twins.I just miss the desperate dictator's assistant, her banter with the cheeky butler and the mother who drops in every five minutes to eat something.

It comes near to heroism, when I imagine that Mr. Dalton had to stand close besides when Ms. Drescher opened her mouth, and THIS VOICE came out. Well, it sounds like a terrific mixture of tonsillitis, adenoids and a tin bucket. Although I could have changed the language of my DVD to german, because Ms. Drescher¬¥s german voice is not half the drama than her own, but I felt a kind of paralyzed, like in a horror film, when you know that it¬¥s not to stand but you can¬¥t close your eyes. Although Mr. Dalton is one of the most excellent actors we have, I found two points 1. The scenes with that sleeping youngest son This was more than acting - it was a natural born father! I loved that, because it¬¥s impossible to act this intensive warmth when you don¬¥t have it inside.2. This kissing-scene with Ms. Drescher It was obviously hard to act this scene, because it looked like he wanted to be on north pole this moment. And I can understand it!All in all, the story is an all-american fairy-tale, and ok for a rainy sunday afternoon.Oh, Ms. Drescher Talk to the hand! (It¬¥s got no ears!!!)

Even Eastern European dictators might find it hard to find much to complain about. Indeed, so lame is this film I was amazed to learn it was intended for a cinema release, although in my part of Slovetzia it seems to have gone straight to video. Actually, this is a pretty harmless way of spending an hour and a bit if you can accept that this is basically a vehicle for Fran Dreschler, and that, presumably, she has some fans in America who both like her and know who she is.Dreschler plays a beautician who gets mistaken for the new tutor of an eastern European dictator and ends up importing consumerism and the American way of life by stealth to the previously contented communist kingdom of Slovetzia. I say communist kingdom because on the strength of this film some Americans don't seem to know the difference between the two. For those of you unfamiliar with Slovetzia, when Errol Flynn was alive it used to be called Ruritania, but later changed its name under communism. These days it is populated entirely by British actors, some of whom attempt mildly Russian accents. You may be as surprised as I was to learn that the tyrannical ruler of Slovetzia is none other than Timothy Dalton. You may remember him from the 1980s when he used to be James Bond. At one point he was even well regarded as a serious Shakespearian actor. What happened to him after leaving the secret service, you might ask? Well, I don't really know, but it can't have been pretty. Somehow he ended up playing second fiddle to Fran Dreschler. I know, a sad end for a man who saved the world at least twice.

Humor for those who cannot think. It is just another adventure of the illiterate nanny from Brooklyn, that is always more boring than the previous adventure, who should have been fired years ago. I won't spoil the work for you, watching it will spoil your day for you with much more class. I ranks right down there with the garbage from the Wayans brothers, John De Bello of Killer Tomatoes fame, Santa with Muscles, and like visual vomit. I give it a 2 and a half. I could actually go lower but it is hard to believe that there are actually efforts in cinematography that are much worse than Fran Drescher in her over played nanny role. Woody Allen, Monty Python, Marx Brothers, Peter Sellers, now there are the experts of comedy worth watching.

First obvious answer is - when you do not laugh. Improved answer - when your only laughs are about the way the movie is made. 'Beautician and the Beast' comes very close to this. The film starts actually from a good idea, kind of a remake of 'The King and I' in a post-Communist European dictature. However what could have been the subject of a good comedy with romantic and political nuances is completely spoiled by the series of not funny gags, previsible plot line, and stereotype characters lacking any comical value. However, the bigger harm is done by the incredibly bad acting. Fran D. is competing for the worst acting that I have ever seen on a big screen. Her acting is beyond the lower level one would expect in TV sitcoms. The rest of the cast are just bad, and look kind of uneasy to have been involved in this film. I felt robbed of my two hours at the end of the film, and sorry not to have gone to sleep earlier (or chosen a different channel). "},{"Title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen !!!

WRONG!BRR,it still gives me the chills thinking back of it.Everything about this movie sucksthe acting,the story,everything!First of all the actingFran Drescher is probably one of the most annoying people ever and not only because of that nagging voice.She just can't act! And they probably chose her for the role since she did nothing more in that terrible sitcom The Nanny and maybe cause she should be beautiful.(NOT!) Timothy Dalton then.Not a bad actor,yet in this movie he puts on an accent that makes no sense at all.It always freaks me out that those Hollywood movies use those over the top accents for Russians or Germans or whatever.It is quite insulting to the natives of those countries,if you ask me.The story is even worse,cause there actually ain't any! Woo,an American chick goes to Slovetzia (!?!?!?) to brainwash a so called dictator and the entire country in the Western ways.Just like Bush does nowadays in Iraq (only Saddam was a real dictator). The tale offers no surprises at all and ends with the two lovebirds kissing on the street,how sweet (uch,uch).Yet,the way that Ken Kwapis (a really legendary director) shows us the way that Eastern Europe lives is extremely narrow minded and very insulting,almost barbaric. Everybody in Slovetzia is an idiot yet the holy American girl saves the entire country with her capitalistic ways.No wonder that a lot of non-western people hate America,just look at this movie.By the way I don't hate America,I just hate the Bush-government!The cliches in this movie were too much for me.The dictator(a bad Stalin look-a-like),the American girl who changes it all,the children who want to become like her. Every cliche of the McCarthy era are shown without any shame.The witch hunter would be proud!For a close look at the egocentric and narrow minded look on the world by some Americans,watch this movie.1/10 (Currently number 4 in my bottom top 10 list) "},{"Title":"What the ****?","Date":"29 November 2002","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I'm sorry that I had to give this such a high rating but there were no negative integers available.
