[{"Title":"Why Are The Winds And The Waves So Restless?","Date":"31 January 1999","Score":"141 out of 148 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, History","Review":"  On Sunday 7 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet in its moorings at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  At the time, no state of war existed between the two nations.  An ingenious pre-emptive strike, as the Japanese 'hawks' saw it, was condemned by the world as one of the greatest acts of treachery in modern history.Tora! Tora! Tora! meticulously traces the build-up to Pearl Harbor by examining the diplomatic, military and intelligence events and developments on both sides.  The film is unimpeachably even-handed, telling both sides' stories simultaneously, and interleaving the Japanese and American versions with intelligence and an almost total absence of jingoism.Japan's warmongers considered their country to be trapped by history and geography.  As the industrial nations surged forward in terms of prosperity and military might, Japan was in danger of being outstripped, having few natural resources of her own.  If Japan was to compete with the USA and USSR, she would have to 'reach out' for the raw materials available in southern Asia and the Pacific, but this would mean confronting the USA, the great maritime power in the Pacific.The film explains all this very well.  We learn that the Japanese have an age-old tradition of striking against their enemies without warning, and that air superiority is the new doctrine.  The brilliant Japanese planners such as Genda (played by Tatsuya Mihashi) have grasped the lessons of the European war and know the vital importance of naval air power.  By 1941, battleships have become a liability - slow, lumbering dinosaurs which invite attack and cannot defend themselves against aircraft.  The way forward is mobile air power, and that means aircraft carriers.  If the Japanese can catch the American carriers at Pearl Harbor and destroy them, then the war will be won before it has properly started.The Americans take a fateful decision to send out their carriers on reconnaissance missions.  This strips Pearl Harbor of protection, but paradoxically ensures that Japan cannot win the war - no matter how spectacular the success of the surprise attack, the mission will fail if the US aircraft carriers survive.Throughout the build-up, the Japanese navy chiefs such as Yamamoto (So Yamomura) have a snippet of classical Japanese poetry on their minds If all men are brothers, why are the winds and the waves so restless?  They take this to mean that it is the rule of nature for man to attack his fellow man.  By the end of the film, Yamamoto has abandoned this view and now believes that We have aroused a sleeping giant, and filled him with a terrible resolve.The film catalogues the accidents and mistakes which combined to make Pearl Harbor a worse disaster for the USA than it need have been.  American aircraft are bunched together in the middle of the airfield in order to reduce the risk of sabotage near the perimeter fence, but this helps the Japanese bombers to destroy them on the ground.  Radar equipment cannot be placed in the best locations to give early warning, and in any event the radar data are misinterpreted when they predict the attack.  Because the attack falls on a weekend, it is difficult for middle-ranking officers to contact military and political chiefs, and the contingency plans are inadequate.  Radio Honolulu broadcasts through the night to guide a fleet of B-17's to Hawaii, inadvertently acting as a navigation beacon for the Japanese warplanes.If the painstaking build-up to the attack is a little slow and ponderous, it is certainly epic in scale, and when the action erupts it comes as a mighty climax.  The tension is palpable as the Japanese planes take off from their carriers, black against the ominous dawn.  What follows is a breath-taking cinematic coup as Pearl Harbor is ravaged.Verdict - A historical account of almost documentary accuracy culminates in vivid action scenes.  A marvellous film.

Considering I have had 34 years to study and learn about the war since the film first was shown, I still maintain it is almost unbeatable in terms of realism and historical accuracy. An added attraction for me has always been it's total lack of a love interest. Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor, T!T!T! is not complicated by any silly love stories. While by recent standards the movie may seem slow paced and plodding, the details of the events leading up to the attack is gratifying to see and actually educational. The attack action is thrilling, well paced, and in its use of models, actual planes and other equipment,is extremely realistic with few distracting anachronisms.

TORA! TORA! TORA! seemed the perfect choice. Recent movies these days depressed me, but thanks to TORA! (and Clint Eastwood 's HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER), my enjoyment in watching movies returned. TORA! is an absolutely excellent film packed with incredibly well done acting and emotion and an overall feeling that leaves you blown away. PEARL HARBOR has quite a bit to live up to after seeing this. The special effects produced in TORA! are completely out of this world (even after thirty years!). More credit goes to how well documented this story goes. The Americans and Japanese did a tremendously exceptional job of recreating the entire events leading up to and including the Pearl Harbor attack. Being a Canadian, I was confused a couple years ago when the local paper announced that the number two (of the top 100) event of the 1900's was the attack on Pearl Harbor. I completely understand now and quite frankly am amazed at how both sides felt throughout the entire ordeal.Simply put, TORA! TORA! TORA! deals with all the events, mistakes (both minor and MAJOR), people involved and attitudes leading up to and during the air raid on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Though not shown, we even have the general feeling of the U.S. President and the Japanese Emperor. Nothing is missed in this movie. It is as close to the actual depiction of Pearl Harbor you can get.For 1970, the special effects are absolutely astonishing. Very little looks fake, and nothing looks over done (like many CGI effects do these days). When the first American battletanks are struck, the explosions are incredible. When the Zero crashes into the building, the explosion is eye catching. Everything is unbelievably excellent. The acting is also first rate, how the Americans handle the warnings of a Japanese attack (they're nuts) was supremely well laid out. How the Japanese carefully planned the attack on Pearl Harbor was frighteningly well thought out. Next credit must go to the music. Jerry Goldsmith has to be one of the greatest composers of all time. The suspense created on the morning of December 7 just before the attack is still hair chilling thirty years later. Nothing seems to be wrong with TORA! except the fact that it is a little too long. A couple times, I was hoping that the attack would just begin and get over with. My patience quickly subsided with that music score and with the Emperor's poem. Very little is wrong with TORA! TORA! TORA!. It is a definite must see for anyone curious about how war works, how mistakes are made and how people respond to such attacks.

I do not personally care for films that warp an important historical event to suit a formulaic date-flick format (a certain travesty involving a big steamship comes immediately to mind). If I go to the movie theater to watch a historical account, then that's what I want to see. _Tora! Tora! Tora!_ is exactly that, and more; it very nearly puts you right in the middle of the conflagration.It continues to be a source of total wonder for me that _Tora! Tora! Tora!_, a movie made nearly thirty-two years ago, is so expertly presented.  The reason for this is twofold usage of lesser-known character actors to keep plot distraction to a minimum, and the usage of vintage working ships and aircraft to keep the realism to a maximum. These two elements merge together to produce what amounts to a cameraman in a time machine filming the actual events on site.Since this was a collaborative effort between both US and Japanese film studios, the numerous switches between scenes will give you a good look at the differences between directing (and acting) styles. I am constantly amazed at the boldness of the content for a film released in the US during the Vietnam War, and only 25 years after the Pearl Harbor attack itself; compared to the rather wooden Martin Balsam and Jason Robards, Takahiro Tamura's Lt. Commander Fuchida is replete with a charisma I would never have expected from The Enemy. The Japanese side of the tale is laid before you so well that one is sent into the minds of the people involved, a rarity for American war films. (Sometimes it goes a little bit over the edge -- Admiral Yamamoto's comment I know the Americans are a proud and just people is a mistranslation -- but the general mood is accurately conveyed overall.)And then there is the beautiful and sometimes chilling scenery. The attack scenes themselves are eye-popping and brazen enough -- an awesome effort given the technology of the period -- but my personal favorite scene is the Japanese lead strike force's departure from their aircraft carrier. Those of you who purchase the DVD version of the movie should crank up the volume at this point. This is a piece of film that most probably can never be shot again REAL aircraft flooring their REAL engines and taking flight from a REAL ship of war, against the backdrop of the early dawn, one after another, until the sky is alive with what looks like waves and waves of warplanes. Although the aircraft and ships used were modifed American stock, the flags, uniforms, and color schemes are all authentic... resulting in a spine-tingling spectacle of Japanese pilots plunging headlong into what was ultimately a disastrous mistake. They are depicted as human beings, as they should be.It is an astoundingly accurate presentation of a dark moment in history for both the US and Japan, free of pretense, pandering to the audience, big-bucks megastars, lovey-dovey sappiness, and computer-generated pixels. You don't *need* any of these things to create a fantastic movie; all you need is history, which we all know is stranger -- and scarier, and more engaging -- than fiction. _Tora! Tora! Tora_ should be in every movie fan's library.

Tora Tora Tora is based on actual events leading up to this avoidable tragedy, notably the bureaucratic bungling and complacency from the top down which allowed the Japanese attack to succeed.Throughout this well done production, the story in true chronological sequence shifts between the two opposing sides with full subtitles giving the role played by each leading actor.The viewer is given a clear concise unfolding of events with the part of the code-breakers importantly emphasized. The attack is quite breathtaking in parts with several scenes closely resembling or being actual footage taken.Ironically the breaking of the Japanese naval code by U.S. Intelligence gave the Americans every opportunity to correctly contemplate the next move of their adversary, but a desire for utmost secrecy by the Roosevelt Administration and the top brass of the Navy and Army restricted the transmission of clear and proper communications necessary for the Pearl Harbor commanders, Admiral Kimmel and General Short to make sound objective judgments regarding their respective commands.Both men were treated shabbily by their superiors in the aftermath of the attack, were relieved of their command, and for decades thereafter had to endure the shame and responsibility placed on them in allowing this occurrence to happen.This movie does a lot to exonerate them from their part in this terrible disaster.P.S. I had the great honor of meeting bugler Richard Fiske personally, (USS West Virginia) with a colleague of mine when we visited Pearl Harbor in March 1997, (plus autograph),and had our photo taken with him. It is one of my enduring photos of this great sailor who gave his time unselfishly as a volunteer survivor, at the base, to give two second generation Australians the respect of knowing that we met a man who belonged to a nation which contributed to the success of winning the Pacific War.

I was pre-kindergarten at the time, but have a good memory. Naturally, I've read extensively about the attack since.Speaking personally, the attack in the film sounded real, though our mother kept me and my sister inside for much of the attack (we had to go outside to get evacuated from our quarters).But that aside the film mirrors historic events closely. However, (possibly a minor spoiler or two follow) there were some little points that had been added for the audience's sake.The MAGIC machine, which was breaking the Japanese PURPLE cipher, did not have to be explained to either officer, but one did, so the audience would get the drift of what was happening. (The actual machine was the greatest cryptological feat of World War II, greater than Enigma, because it was developed from scratch by Frank Rowlett under the direction of William Friedmann.) The film was based in large part from the books of Professor Gordon W. Prenge, an historian who specialized in Pearl Harbor. Prenge interviewed many of the principals in the action, on both sides, and became friends with several.This is the best film on Pearl Harbor. I got tapes for my mother and sister, both of whom shared my reaction to it.

The film is balanced insofar as it's perspective, being told from both the Japanese and American sides. The storyline begins pretty much with the decision by the Japanese government that, unless negotiations with the United States were to take a decidedly different direction, there would be no choice but to go to war. It then follows the planning of the attack by Admiral Yamamoto and his staff. Concurrently, it shows that the negotiations between the two countries was not going well at all (from the Japanese standpoint). Depicted are, sadly, the absolutely dreadful decisions made by the US Commanders at Pearl Harbor, the ignoring of evidence that an attack was imminent, the lack of coordination in communications that resulted in huge delays in receiving crucial information and, lastly, ignoring the incoming Japanese raiders after they were spotted on American radar on their way in. The actual bombing and combat footage is very well done. The acting is superb by the entire stellar cast. Overall, if you want to know how a tragic event came to be, this film will explain it. It is historically mostly correct, although some artistic license was taken, for sure. Overall, an excellent production!

I also loved the acting in it. Martin Balsam and Jason Robards should have been nominated for their performances as Admiral Kimmel and General Short, respectively. Also, I wonder how much different it would have been if Akira Kurosawa had directed the Japanese scenes as he originally was supposed to. I also wonder if the fact that it dealt with one of the darker chapters in American history had something to to with its poor box office showing on this side of the Pacific (ironically, it was a box office smash in Japan). However, it is still a great film and I especially loved it at the end when Yamamoto made his famous comment I fear we have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with terrible resolve.

Perry forced open the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate that governed Japan to take a reality check and open trade with the outside world. In less than 100 years Japan became an industrial power, every bit as formidable as any western country and was able to attack the country that forced it open.Our Far eastern foreign policy from then until 1941 was simply trading concessions with both Asian powers, Japan and China. When they became rivals in Asia we and other countries had to choose up sides. Alternately we favored China and Japan, but in 1941 U.S. sympathies in Washington and in public opinion was favoring China. The island chain of Japan is notoriously lacking in natural resources. Even the United Kingdom which it is often compared to has deposits of coal and iron and that created the British steel industry. Japan has to import and in the age of imperialism, they became every bit as imperialistic as any of our western countries, maybe more so because their need was greater.Note during the film of Tora Tora Tora it is remarked that the U.S. Fleet in Hawaii was like a dagger pointed at Japan. When the island country of Hawaii was formally annexed to the United States and the Phillipines acquired after the Spanish American War at the end of the 19th century we became rivals in the Pacific to the Japanese. And imagine if the Japanese who were most anxious to annex Hawaii themselves had done so. The dagger would have been at our West Coast. Of course the poor Hawaiians had little to say about any of this.All that has to be factored into what you are seeing in Tora Tora Tora. That and more is what led up to the events that are meticulously recorded in documentary style. Unlike the later film Midway which spoiled a good account of the battle with a personal story, Tora Tora Tora does not waste any of the viewers time in that regard.The participants are there in all their flaws. Admiral Husband Kimmel who made the fortunate choice of sending out the aircraft carriers which was an act that may have eventually won the Pacific War for America is played by Martin Balsam. Nevertheless he took the fall for the attack as did Chief of Naval Operations Harold Stark played by Edward Andrews.One very luckless man was Army commander in Hawaii General Joseph Short played by Jason Robards, Jr. who was in real life in the Navy and at Pearl Harbor. Short made the fatal decision to put all the aircraft at Hickam field in the center of the field because he was afraid of saboteurs. The better to bomb them from the air.Three members of FDR's cabinet are portrayed, George MacReady as Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Leon Ames as Frank Knox the Secretary of the Navy. Franklin Roosevelt being the wise leader he was and knowing that our eventual entry demanded bipartisan support chose a pair of Republicans in Stimson and Knox. Would that our current president had that kind of foresight.George MacReady who usually portrayed polished villains is a good guy here and has one of his best screen moments as the Japanese envoys are ushered into his office AFTER the attack has begun to issue Japanese diplomatic demands. Tora Tora Tora should be shown in schools as a great piece of well acted documentary film making if that's not a contradiction in terms. It won an Oscar for Special Effects which are out of date compared to the later Pearl Harbor movie, but still done well. Catch it if you can by all means.

The book describes how the pilots in crews of three, zoomed down over the mountains behind the city, over the pier, and dropped torpedoes at a breakwater 300 yards away. The movie had all these details. Throughout, it was accurate even down to the exact wording of communications and quotes from the various people involved.I loved how the Japanese directed the Japanese parts and vice versa for the Americans. It really told both sides of the story.Technically as a film though, it has limitations. Some of the models used are kind of cheesy, but some are actually pretty good. But hey, it was 1970, this is before Star Wars even. And a lot of the acting is pretty wooden.If you're looking for great special effects, and not much substance, see Pearl Harbor. If you're interested in the story, the why, and figures involved in this historic event, definitely see Tora! Tora!

Told equally from the Japanese point of view (actually, more), it reflects a joint Japanese-American effort to stage the events leading up to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack itself.  Martin Balsam plays Admiral Kimmel, supported by a good cast portraying the key U.S. figures, but closest to a central personality (there really is none) is Admiral Yamamoto (So Yamamura), the architect of the strike.  Tora contrasts his views on naval/air strategies with those of the Japanese Old Guard, and emphasizes his doubts about the notion of war with the U.S.From the American side, apart from Kimmel and U.S. Army General Short (Jason Robards), the principal characters are decoders Colonel Rufus Bratton (E.G. Marshall) and Lieutenant Commander Alvin Kramer (Wesley Addy) -- actually, in both cases, more so than Short.  Tora gets straight to the point -- no good love stories (From Here to Eternity) or inane ones (Pearl Harbor) get in the way.  The only mention of the subject comes when Kramer, as the ability to trust anyone is being questioned, is asked whether he trusts his wife, and states, as a matter of fact, I do.  Good, let's get down to business.Unlike in the plastic Pearl, in which oil is the 10-second explanation for the bombing, the Japanese are treated in depth.  The warlike spirit is shown, but Japanese are not all saber-rattling fanatics, and are willing to consider peaceful alternatives.  Aside from Yamamoto,  important figures are strategist Admiral Genda; naval task force leader Admiral Nagumo; and air strike leader Lt. Fuchida.  I won't bother to name other Japanese actors, but suffice it to say none is Toshiro Mifune; for whatever reason, many (including myself at one point--well, I was once his neighbor in Tokyo) seem convinced he is in Tora.Tora being chiefly a chronicle of military facts, there is no appearance from symbols of state President Roosevelt, though his advisors figure prominently, and Emperor Hirohito, and only a brief one of hawkish Prime Minister Tojo; his predecessor Prince Konoye, whose desire not to have war with America is eclipsed, is given more focus.  The issue of Roosevelt's advance knowledge was rudimentary in 1970, and is not the sort of thing the film sought to treat anyway.  Amen, read that last clause again, those who criticize unfairly some aspects of the movie.Kimmel is portrayed more sympathetically than Short, who comes across as somewhat brusque and brassy and makes a major strategical error by keeping U.S. planes together in the airfields to guard against sabotage in Hawaii by Japanese locals.  From the navy's viewpoint, problems were perceived, but a principal difficulty was simply that there were not enough ships to go around, aside from the problem of generally underdeveloped mechanisms of defense, such as radar.  However, the movie also shows, more subtly, that Kimmel was not up to the task.The earlier part of Tora focuses on piecemeal strategic points without completely tying them together.  However, there is much to cover, so it is difficult to provide contexts and explanations for everything.  What we do get is presentation of the most important strategic issues, and America's unpreparedness.  As the time of the attack approaches, Tora takes advantage of its better opportunity with events, as opposed to strategies the Japanese submarine, the radar warning, the telegram, other communications failures, bad luck with weather.  It clearly sets forth the near-term facts behind America's failure of prevention--just tell us what happened.  But ultimately, the biggest blunder is on the Japanese side, separate from the attack itself.  Admiral Yamamoto's and Admiral Halsey's contemplations fittingly wind down the dramatic recreation of the shock and surprise of the attack.There are beautiful scenes of Hawaii, too; indeed, Pearl edges out Tora only in sunsets.   The sea and blue sky, islands and mountains, Hawaiian music at military clubs.  The Japanese planes take off in dark early dawn, nice aura, then a striking rising sun precedes beautiful dawn settings and the attack.Sorry to be so narrative, but to do so is fitting in reviewing this very narrative movie.  There are no dash and elan, no good guys or bad guys, and in fact, no protagonists or antagonists.  Expressions of anger are not terribly intense and are fleeting, no intense passions are worked up.  The closest thing to a hero is Colonel Bratton, whose importunations to accept his warnings are legitimized only too late.Tora turns the trick for viewers with a more straightforward than sensationalistic approach who want to see a good, intelligent story; uncontrived people; an excellent extended battle staging yet no cheap special effects; no blood and gore; good flow.  I am a big fan of Lawrence of Arabia, and tho I ultimately see all its scenes as justified, I admit it had moments of drag, in both the first and second halfs.  Some people think Tora drags at times, but it never drags for me.  Besides, it is much shorter than Lawrence and many other epics.  Fair enough, some simply do not like this type of movie as much as I do.  But the attack on Pearl Harbor itself is one of the most dramatic events in military history and certainly U.S. history, and that helps carry the day.  Geopolitics, strategy, unpreparedness, codebreaking issues, miscommunication, before a war, then a sneak attack -- John Wayne not needed.10 out of 10.

As a historical drama it is almost perfect. Based on Gordon Prange's book of the same name, the film draws on Prange's 30 years of official USN research to draw some interesting and thought-provoking questions about the mistakes made by both sides in the lead up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.For the history buffs it even raises some questions which are not part of most people's understanding of how and why it happened the way it did. For the general public it puts all the basic points of the attack into one neat, interesting package. Some characters have been combined and events changed slightly to aid production but nothing of any real significance is altered.The Japanese sequences were originally intended to be directed by the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa but when the producers realised that those parts alone made up four hours of screen time, the trouble started and Kurosawa was replaced. The acting is solid but unremarkable, as one would expect from a film of this type.The battle sequences are, for the most part, beautifully done. The producers spent cubic dollars converting old trainers to look like Japanese fighter and attack aircraft and succeeded brilliantly. Only the real oficianados can tell them apart. The flying is fantastic and it looks brilliant against the Hawaiian scenery.About the only thing missing, and probably a salient reason for its lack of real commercial penetration, was the lack of a love angle.By contrast, it is amazing to me that Pearl Harbor, made some 30 years later, was so bad in comparison. Had the producers actually watched this film before making such a turkey, they might have actually learned something. Tora, Tora, Tora! is a film which could be shown to any history class with few concerns as to its authenticity.

Tora! Tora! is a vision from both sides of the coin, not just the American one.Pearl Harbor is more a love story in its context and has only one vision, the unilateral and unnecessary patriotic American one. This is not history as it should be told.Tora! Tora! Tora! was the codename given by the Japanese fleet to its carrier pilots to start the attack on Pearl Harbor.This is far less a shooting war movie, than an actual historic recreation of facts happening on a certain month, week, day and moment in 1941.Everything is told, from the bureaucracy involved (slow at that, as usual), to the actual military decisions on both sides and on the ground.The attack, when it comes, is a majestic recreation that, once watched side by side with the actual documentary footage available, makes you realize that were it in black & white, one could not distinguish its differences. That's how accurate it is!Expenses were not spared at all in doing this recreation.

I actually have it on DVD and never watched it. But Fox played a few war movies on Veterens Day and I watched it again. First I love war movies. Not the soapy Pearl Harbor type movies, but a real nuts and bolts war movie. On seeing this movie for a second time a I noticed a lot of things I didn't see the first time. Little thing like the submarine trying to sneak into Pearl Harbor and how our ship saw it and blew it up. I never knew that happened. And the aftermath in which a call is made to the base commander and all he can say is ask for confirmation because these things happen all of the time. I wanted to smack him. It is incredible how a lot of middle men actually prevented word about the attack getting to the right person. Such as the guys who pick up a plane formation heading for Pearl Harbor and the men who received the message just brushing it off, and not conveying it to the correct person. Or how the Wesley Addy character had to run around DC trying to talk to anyone who would listen to no avail. Or the man who has direct access t the Commanders after getting concrete evidence and decides not to call the commander at Pearl Harbor but wants to run it by the President first. It is amazing how middlings actually held the fate of PearL Harbor in their hands and blew it. I also admire way they show the Japanese perspective. I love movies like that because it shows that the other side are soldiers like we are and are committed to their cause too, right or wrong. It humanizes them as it should. All Quiet in The Western Front was one of my favorite novels and movies because it was told through the eyes of a very young German recruit. I see how they are all psyched into going to war as they do here to young men and when they fight they see this is not what they signed up for. There was no side stories, thank you, because they ruin all war movies. This is a very good war movie. And it gave us a inside view of the steps leading to the Attack. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see good movie about Pearl Harbor without an foolish love story or side stories.

Left out, mostly because it had not yet become publicly available, was the information that the White House, the State Department, and the upper echelons of the military kept from Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.

Pearl Harbour is shown as an American debacle, and a terrible Japanese mistake. Having read a number of books on the subject (Day of Infamy, At Dawn We Slept etc.) I believe this is the most accurate depiction of the events. There is an incredible tension in watching fallible human beings - not plastic heroes - cope with momentous events. In some ways it reminded me of 13 Days(2000), but without it's successful conclusion. Richard Fleischer has had a spotty career but this is one of his best, combining his documentary-realistic style (as in The Boston Strangler(1968), Compulsion(1959), 10 Rillington Place (1971))and his taste for spectacle (as in The Vikings (1958)). Fukasakus work I am not so familiar with, but it can be compared to sympathetic treatments of the Imperial Army by other Japanese directors- Ichikawa's Harp of Burma(1956) and Kobayashi's The Human Condition(1959). There are a number of British and American  war films that attempt to show the Japanese troops as more than Tojo and his band of bug-eyed monkeys (a quote from a John Wayne film), such as Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai(1957), John Boorman's Hell in the Pacific(1968), and Spielberg's Empire of the Sun(1987).Just as TTT was criticised for it's even-handed approach, so too were these films. Here in Australia, the Pacific War also causes much angry debate, mainly due to the Australian POW's who died in Japanese captivity, & the Japanese bombing of Darwin (our Pearl Harbour). I think TTT was unpopular at the time for another important reason. TTT was a film about an unprepared world power - the USA - being defeated by an underestimated and implacable Asian foe in a daring sneak attack. TTT was released 2 years after the Tet Offensive (1968) in the Vietman War, and must have seemed uncomfortably close to home. Hollywood in the late 1960'& early 1970's, shied away from films depicting the Vietnam War (too divisive, too downbeat, too controversial etc.), but were OK on films set in another time tackling similar themes and questions. Films that are obvious metaphors for Vietnam include Altman's MASH(1970)(Korean War as Vietnam War); Penn's Little Big Man(1970)(Washita River as My Lai, Little Big Horn as the Tet Offensive); Robert Wise'Sand Pebbles(1966)(1920's China as Vietnam); Ralph Nelson's Soldier Blue(1970)(Indian Wars as Vietnam) and even British films like Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade(1968)(Crimean War as Vietnam). I guess people can only watch so much defeat, which is why Patton(1970) was welcomed. Even though it begins with an American catastrophe (Kasserine Pass), it ends in victory. "},{"Title":"Powerful!

I was fascinated then, and not even a military history buff as I am now. but over the years, I've come to appreciate an effort well-done. On the scaled of this film, to have built full-scale mockups of Nagato and Akagi and huge models of Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, and all the rest is stupendous work and it really shows in the finished film. My comment, based on having seen that turkey Pearl Harbor which from this point on I shall refer to as PHew, one can really understand the difference between full scale models and CGI for special effects. Sure CGI can give filmmakers incredible abilities to create anything they want and make it do everything, but it's so obvious that CGI is used, it's very transparent and forgettable. The blowing up of USS Arizona in TTT was far and away more stunning and realistic than a computer-generated one in PHew. Remember 'Titanic?' A real, full-scale ship is what did the trick and made it come to life. PHew was a waste of film and money, and an insult to the men and women show survived and died that December day. As for the few shots of 'John Finn' the intrepid lone machine gunner who shot down a Zero and damaged others at Kaneohe Bay NAS, the depiction is a bit off. Finn wasn't behind a sandbag revetment, and he wasn't bandaged up during the fight. How do I know? John Finn is my neighbor, here in East County San Diego and I've talked with this fascinating old veteran many times. Even at over 96 years of age, he's sharp and interesting to talk to. He too, prefers TTT to PHew. BIG surprise. This film also shows a cautious, reluctant Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam) and acerbic General Walter Short (Jason Robards) as being unable to save their commands in the weeks prior to the attack. They had tried to be prepared, but failed to take the right action, despite their correct intentions. Washington's diplomats, politicians and senior military are depicted as being complacent and not taking the threat of Japanese aggression in the Pacific seriously. This is partially true, and FDR is said in some accounts to have been holding back on critical information which could have warned of the impending attack. History is still debating this. But the truth is, Kimmel and Short were made the scapegoats for the attack. They didn't deserve that fate, and I see them as casualties, just as the more than 1,200 other men and women killed that day. Soh Yamamura, who portrayed Isoroku Yamamoto, does a credible job of handling the role of a man who was targeted by US forces during the war as the leading villain in the attack. Yet he wasn't totally in favor of such action. He was forced by the General staff, particularly Hideki Tojo, to hit the American fleet and keep the US out of Japanese aims in the Western Pacific. Yamamura's brooding scenes give the admiral emotional weight. BTW, did anyone notice not one of the P-40 fighters flown by Lt. Welsh or Lt. Taylor flew in the streets of Honolulu? And they didn't bring down the entire Japanese Naval Air Service? Funny thing, even though it's not as visually exciting as PHew, it's far better and more believable. My feelings about this film are this It's not perfect, but no one has ever done better since. Nine out of Ten.

I remember when this movie first came out in Birmingham. It was advertised as a special event, you had to special order tickets for it. My mother and I went to see it on a Saturday afternoon, and, even though I knew what was coming, I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. Based on the books THE BROKEN SEAL and, if I'm not mistaken by a book of the same title as the movie, it tells the story of Pearl Harbor very well, from all the events leading up to the attack to the day of infamy itself. This is not historical fiction, this does not try to juice things up with a tear jerker love story. This is an unsentimental, meticulous look at actual events leading up to the attack as told from both the American and Japanese perspectives. Jerry Goldsmith's score to this movie is the most emotionally gripping I've ever heard. For soundtrack buffs, it's available on CD, on a double bill with the soundtrack to PATTON.I have seen several movies about the attack on Pearl Harbor. There is PEARL HARBOR (which is a piece of crap), IN HARM'S WAY, and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. There is even a Pearl Harbor sequence in THE WINDS OF WAR. These latter three movies are good, in fact I have DVDs of IN HARM'S WAY and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, as well as TORA TORA TORA. But this is by far the best of the lot and it gives you the straight scoop without any politically correct BS thrown in. One emerges from this film emotionally drained, as you feel the fury of watching our airplanes getting bombed while trying to take off. Your heart aches as you watch a lone American airplane in a dogfight with a whole squadron of Japanese fighter planes. An excellent film. 10 out of 10. I don't give that lightly, either.

And, very, very few war films try to explain the events leading up to it. This drives ex-history teachers like me nuts! However, Tora! Tora! Tora! is an amazing film because they tried so hard and the film feels so complete. Of course the filmmakers had to make a few adjustments--such as converting American T-6 airplanes to look a lot like Japanese planes and recreating Japanese ships because they'd all been lost during WWII. But they TRIED--and I appreciate that. And again and again, the film stresses details--details that might bore some viewers but make history nuts salivate!So why am I giving this movie a 10? After all, I almost never give such a score to a movie. In addition to the two huge pluses above, the movie excels because it does not burden itself with superfluous love stories (such as in The Battle of Britain) nor does it give way to sentiment. It is almost like an actual recreation of events as they unfolded-- brought to the big screen in epic fashion. All in all, probably the best war film of all time because of its attention to detail, scope and accuracy.Apparently, Roger Ebert HATED this film for the reasons I loved it.

The story follows faithfully to the events (from both American and Japanese perspectives) that unfolded in a straightforward (but sometimes boring) manner. Another major factor is the focus. Tora! does not dwell on distracting subplots, such as a love story, to move the film along. The slow pacing of the film in the first half needs improvement though.While none of the extensive cast gives a stellar display, the technical aspects of the film surely steal the show. With visual effects still in its infancy, the recreation of the actual attack on Pearl Harbour can be summarized in one word - 'Spectacular!'. Realistic (although less exciting than Michael Bay's version) and absorbing enough to make any viewer gaze in awe, and admire how filmmakers could achieve that much in the early 1970s. Tora! Tora!

Whether there are inaccuracies in the telling, for dramatic purposes, I'm not sure--but it does seem to be even handed in its treatment of events.Although the cast is an impressive one, there are no single performances that stay in the mind. Instead, the viewer is aware of the vast scope of the story and the series of events that took place just before that fateful day--which is as it should be.The Japanese segments held more fascination for me than the American sequences, for some reason. The pacing of the first two-thirds of the story is on the slow side. Not until the last forty-five minutes does the film come to life with an absolute sense of realism in its display of the bombing raid both from the air and on the ground.Technically, the film is a superb example of '70s film-making. All of the battle scenes are extremely well done for maximum effect.Yamamoto's final words serve as a chilling reminder, the kind of remark that still holds true in today's world where the U.S. is fighting a war against terrorism which, hopefully, has aroused the sleeping giant (the U.S.) to the extent that we will eventually triumph over our enemies who want to kill us as we were the victors over Japan.As a history lesson, this is a very valuable film indeed.

In the context of a film of this type, it is far better than listening to overzealous actors mumbling their lines so as to get the proper effect.The directing is good. Battle sequences are well executed and look good, given that the film was made in 1970. One must appreciate the amount of work that must have gone into those scenes. Furthermore, that strange Hawaiian feeling creeps into the film at certain points as well, which is a nice touch.The editting crew must also be given due credit. The film shows us what is happening at several crucial but disparate places simultaneously during the lead up to the attack. As such, the scenes revolve invariably from the Admiral's office to the General's office, to the Japanese embassy, to the decoding room, etc. This sets the film on an even tempo that allows the viewer to follow what is going on at a good pace. I do have one gripe about the editting, however. There were no captions to keep us informed on the exact chronology of happenings, except the well-known date of December 7 1941.As an outsider, I am not weighed down by national pride when I say that this a gem of a film that overwhelms the viewer with its sheer honesty. Patriotic Americans might find it hard to like it (but there are certain scenes that seem to be made to satisfy these viewers as well, like the American fighters planes that were not at the base when the attack occurred).

Tora! as an overblown spectacle. They are wrong. The immensity of the film is perfectly in keeping with the immensity of the logistics required for the attack and the immensity of the attack itself. The production values are high, the colors vivid and crisp, and the special effects, 30 years after the film's release, are still state of the art. There are scenes from the attack on Hickam Field whose realism and spectacle are astounding.The casting is wonderful, with Jason Robards and Martin Balsam playing the star-crossed General and Admiral who would have to play the patsies for the negligence of higher ups. There are few truly secondary roles in this film, for almost every element of the story is crucial to the progression of events. Thus, secondary roles like those of E.G. Marshall and Wesley Addy are riveting, because of the extraordinary situations in which their characters are placed.We are also given intimate access to the Japanese side during planning and preparation. Because this is a co-production between Americans and Japanese, the latter are portrayed without caricature, as people who believe in the cause which is inspiring this dastardly attack. I don't know any of the Japanese actors, beyond a few familiar faces, but they are every bit as engaging as the Americans.We know what is going to happen - that Pearl Harbor will be successfully attacked by the Japanese - but so skillful are the direction and the characterization, and so authentic is the historical reconstruction, that we are easily transported into the moment rather than being dangled above it, as if we we watching a documentary. Unlike Pearl Harbor, which insults every man and woman who served in World War II, Tora! Tora! Tora! in its powerful, unadorned way, pays them tribute.

What this movie lacks in special effects it makes up for in plot and detail.  This film shows both sides of the attack and puts little spin (as far as I can see) on the events that unfolded in 1941.  What makes this movie so great?  First, the Japanese speak Japanese, not English.  Second, the events that lead up to the attack are real (again, I am not a history major so I don't know everything that happened).  Third, real planes!!!  Many modern war movies decide to please the English-speaking audiences and all the dialogue that is needed is done in English rather than in the native tongue of the character.  Tora! Tora! Tora! uses both English and Japanese, adding another layer of realism to the film.  For all of you who can't read subtitles, learn to.  It might get a little tiresome, but after a while it becomes second nature.Unlike some war movies that use a famous battle as a backdrop, this film builds up to the battle with precision.  There is not false story woven into the plot to attract viewers, it is a truthful account of what happened.  This movie also gives justifications for what happened.  Pearl Harbor just throws out Yamamoto's quote about 'waking a sleeping giant,' but this movie gives the detail that this was because the Japanese ultimatum was handed in after the attack took place instead of before.  Done in the 70's, this movie used real planes and real stunts.  Modern movies tend to computerize many of the attacks and squadrons.  This movie uses real planes doing real things.  Does it really matter if the pilots are flying in front of a screen?  And, how many times do you need to see flaming fuselage rush at you?  A classic war movie, dated by many of today's standards, this film is excellent in showing the build-up and attack on Pearl Harbor.  If you want to see a movie about the attack, watch this movie, but be prepared to not see any fancy special effects.  It might look like a regular PBS documentary on what happened, but it is still good.  If you like to see what really happened - without Hollywood hype shoved in your face - then this is a movie to see.  I have heard many people mention that this is THE movie about Pearl Harbor, and I agree with them.  10/10 "}{"Title":"A realistic look at the events at Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into WWII.","Date":"16 January 1999","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, History","Review":"  Tora!

We even thought there was something wrong with their (the Japanese) eyesight because their eyes were shaped differently (we called them slanted). This was my generation, and it was more so for the previous one. That is why TTT did so poorly when it premiered across America. There were still a lot of hard feelings abounding (watching the film as a child, the audience around me roared every time a Japanese aeroplane was shot down).

Made by Fox, it was an attempt to emulate the success of its previous epic World War II film The Longest Day but it is not on the same level. My major criticism of the film is that it is slowly paced. It is too long at 2 hours and 28 minutes, particularly since the attack does not begin in earnest until 1 hour and 50 minutes into the film.The first hour and a quarter of the film, give or take, is very effective as we are shown both the Japanese planning the attack and the Americans' lack of preparation for it. These scenes are filled with a great sense of tension, foreboding and a terrible inevitability. The American sequences are very well directed by Richard Fleischer - as I said in my review of Soylent Green, a master at maintaining tension - while the Japanese ones are handled equally well by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku. After that, however, it becomes a bit of a drag until the planes actually arrive at Pearl Harbor. I didn't really feel that I needed to see multiple scenes of said planes or the Japanese fleet in the process of travelling to Hawaii. I don't think that they really added anything to the film, to be honest. The scenes of American mismanagement and bureaucracy prior to the attack were far more necessary to the plot but they were not done as well as the similar scenes in A Bridge Too Far. I liked the fact that the Japanese scenes, which comprise almost half the film, are actually performed in the relevant language as it gives the film a great sense of authenticity. I had never seen in a film wholly or partly in a non- European language before so that was interesting. Although there were too many flying scenes, they were nevertheless spectacular, as were the often deeply affecting battle scenes when the attack finally began.The best performance in the film is given by Sō Yamamura as Admiral Isokoru Yamamoto, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. He orders a preemptive strike on the US Pacific Fleet as he believes that destroying it represents the only serious prospect for victory. Even so, he does not share the optimism of senior Army figures and politicians who long for war with the United States. He is personally opposed to the war on the grounds that it would be disastrous for Japan. The Emperor Hirohito, who is not depicted in the film presumably because he was still alive and still reigning when it was made, has no desire for war either. However, they both find themselves on the losing side of the argument. Yamamura does an excellent job of depicting Yamamoto's conflict between his loyalty to his country and the realities of sound military strategy. Since I do not know a word of Japanese other than tora, I found that I paid more attention to his facial expressions than I usually do and they played a major role in conveying that conflict. At the end of the film, Yamamoto observes, I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. There is no evidence to suggest that he ever actually said this but it is difficult to disagree with the sentiment.On the English speaking side, the best performance is given by Martin Balsam as Yamamoto's American counterpart Admiral Husband E. Kimmel. He is depicted in the film as a good man and a competent commander whose ability to perform was severely constrained by the incompetence of others and bureaucracy. Kimmel is under severe pressure for much of the film but manages to keep a level head throughout. Ten days after the attack, he was relieved of his command and demoted. He retired in disgrace in 1942. Played well by Jason Robards, General Walter Short is treated less sympathetically in that he is depicted as an obstinate and often short-sighted man. He is shown to be more concerned with the risk of sabotage than outside attack. In a plan that backfired drastically, he orders that the planes be positioned in the middle of airfields so that they would be safe from sabotage. Unfortunately, he might as well have painted giant bullseyes on them.The most sympathetic characters in the film are perhaps Colonel Rufus Bratton and Commander Alwyn Kramer, played by Balsam's 12 Angry Men co-star E.G. Marshall and Wesley Addy respectively. On the night of December 6, 1941, they make a valiant effort to alert the US authorities that an attack is imminent, having learned of it from decrypted Japanese messages. However, their warnings are not taken seriously until it is too late. The film also features great performances from Joseph Cotten as Henry L. Stimson, Eijiro Tono as Admiral Nagumo, James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, Edward Andrews as Admiral Stark, Leon Ames as Frank Knox, Neville Brand as Lt. Kaminski and Takahiro Tamura as Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the attack. Fuchida is the only major character who was still alive when the film was made. After the war, he settled in the United States. I can't imagine that he went to see the film though.Overall, this is certainly a very enjoyable film but it never reaches the level that it should. It should have been edited more tightly as it is about half an hour too long. Still, it is the best film that I have seen on the subject of Pearl Harbor.

The sophistication of the screenplay is such that I thought it was from the mid-eighties, at least. The multitude of human, social factors involved in the U.S. failure and the Japanese (partial) success is given due consideration in the movie, as scenes with numerous political and military figures on both sides characterize the forces involved that lead inevitably to the attack. The sceenplay is thorough, relentless and intelligent. To make-simple and accessible a very tangled situation with many cross-currents and short circuits is a testament to the skill of the producers of this movie. I was very impressed that the producers were able to somehow manage scenes with period-correct ships and aircraft. I did not know there were that many Zero's, Kate's and P-40B's airworthy back in 1970. I'm not sure how they did it. The scenes on the runway are some of the most thrilling I have ever seen in cinema. I need to say that I think more time should have been devoted to the sailors trapped below decks. I know there was a fleeting scene where-in someone yelled The hatch is jammed, but there should have been more, considering, perhaps especially, the travail of those trapped inside the U.S.S.

Although a bit long (144 minutes) it offers perspectives from a number of people who were either involved in the circumstances leading up to war or were personally affected by the decision. While historically correct for the most part I think it also bears mentioning that it also includes some opinions which have endured since this event that might not be as accurate as some people may believe. For example, many people have blamed Major General Walter C. Short (played by Jason Robards) for his decision to crowd the American airplanes together on the airfield which made them a very easy target for the Japanese dive-bombers. However, this decision was based on a logical assumption that sabotage from Japanese agents was a far greater threat than an actual surprise attack prior to a declaration of war. And while the movie presents his concern it also continues the unfair portrayal of incompetence which he had to endure until his untimely death 8 years later. He was eventually exonerated by the United States Senate in 1999. Be that as it may, this was an exciting film to watch with some very good action sequences and special effects. As a matter of fact it won the Academy Award that year for its special effects. That said, this movie should definitely interest those who enjoy films of this type. Above average.

Tora! Tora!' is literally like looking through a window into history itself. Dim-witted viewers may prefer Michael Bay's awfully written and poorly directed chick-flicked version of the story from 2001, which is a travesty and an insult to those who were there. I'm fine with that. If they want to watch Michael Bay's 'Pearl Harbor' while they breast feed their three year olds and release their pet pythons into the Everglades, I'm perfectly cool. But to those who prefer thoughtful films with realistic action, careful direction, and scenarios that make sense, comes an underrated masterpiece. That underrated masterpiece is 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'. Not only does it successfully tell the true story of Pearl Harbor in a documentary-style fashion while managing to keep the audience interested, but it also succeeds as a film where 'Pearl Harbor' does not. 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' has the most realistic battle sequences ever filmed, the greatest special effects in a war film, the greatest movie sets ever built (Which include an entire recreation of the Japanese Battleship Nagato, an entire section of the USS Arizona's stern, and the flight deck and bridge of the Carrier Akagi, meticulously accurate, although the bridge is on the starboard side rather than port as it was in real life), the greatest sound effects in a war film other than those of 'Platoon'... Need I go on?In short, it is a spectacular and realistic film that sticks fully to the facts, rather than speculation or fiction, or romantic nonsense like Bay's film does. It tells the TRUE STORY of Pearl Harbor... The story of the Japanese military leaders and admirals who carefully plotted the attack out, the generals, admirals and officials on the American side who failed to heed the warnings and allowed it to happen, to the courageous and determined Japanese airmen who carried it out, to the equally as courageous and determined American soldiers and sailors on the burning airfields and sinking ships who tried to repulse it.It does have some very minor inaccuracies, like the wing shapes and markings of the A6M Zeros, or the model of the B17s being flown by the American airmen coming in from the mainland, whom the Japanese were tragically mistaken for by the radar boys at Opana Point. It also shows sailors evacuating the USS Navada via rope ladders or simply jumping, which never happened. It also shows the destroyer USS Ward as a modern, post-1945 vessel, rather than the antiquated, WWI-era four-funneled destroyer she actually was. And, less noticeably, the Japanese Carrier Akagi's bridge is on the starboard side, rather than to port, as it was in real life. But this doesn't matter, since the film's film's portrayal of life aboard a Japanese Carrier, as well as the technical details involved, are still paramount. But, other than these few, minor glitches, everything else in 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is at least 99% accurate, from the way the USS Arizona looked when she exploded, to the moment in which Adm. Husband Kimmel (played wonderfully by Martin Balsam), said It would have been merciful had it killed me, when a spent round of ammunition smashed through the window of his headquarters and scarred his jacket. No film has ever shown the suffering and terror experienced by those who were there better than this film, from the burning corpses strewn across the decks of the Nevada to the horrific sight of the Arizona being consumed in an explosion that killed more than a thousand men in an instant. When watching the film, you can almost smell the burning fuel and feel the concussion of the bomb-hits. You can feel the jubilation of Cmdr. Mitsuo Fuchida in his B5N High-Level Bomber, high above the jagged Hawaiian hills, when he sees the U.S. fleet totally asleep and waiting for his flight to sink it, and the dismay Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto must have felt when he found out that his primary targets, the U.S. carriers Enterprise and Lexington, were out on a training exercise and out of the range of his own fleet.'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is a realistic, terrifying, and fascinating film that every American should see, and a fine tribute to the brave few, on both sides, who were at Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the morning in which America's hopes for peace in the Pacific capsized like the USS Oklahoma.

Albeit for a few others, but - tora, tora, tora, showed both sides of the coin with the Americans, and the Japanese at how a message was lost in the chain of paper flow for General Marshall to read too late.Roosevelt I think deliberately did this to spite the Japanese in bringing America into the war. Because of this, he halted all trade agreements from Japan, (Which was against the war rules act) and used preliminary means to stop the radar contact to go through as planned. This inevitably meant that the USA, and their government was to become the unwilling victim, by order of the president in secret, to hoist the troops into the war.Japan's emperor himself saw this coming, and wanted nothing to do with the war. Yet as with all joint chiefs, and war mongrels the heads of state were nothing more than pawns. Since roosevelt was already part of the banking cartels he knew how prosperous war can be. With confusing messages from each department, nothing was really established until the fateful day at pearl harbour.By rights, each department head was warned in some way or another, yet with all the surrealistic chains of command, nobody really knew what was happening. For me, this film had shown at how ignorance with the president showed his true colours. To make money at the expense of military men and women, to become the hand of the devil in order to sacrifice those few thousand men at pearl, along with the majestic ships that were docked there.I don't think war in any shape or form is human, but when a man who runs a country uses those around him like a pawn for his own gains, then he should have been the one to drop the two bombs in Hiroshima, and Nagasaki in person. Not by some unmoral decision to get bombers to do it, and fly back home. Roosevelt was a coward, he goaded Japan, even went as far as to make sure all orders were from General Marshall, and nobody else. But since he knew what the General's official routines were, again used someone for his pleasure.Tora Tora Tora, will live on as a great example at why even the Japanese generals, albeit a few of them were so opposed to attacking Pearl. Even the war. With the film midway all it was, was just a bunch of actors made to look good against a fake backdrop of many scenes in WWII. This movie however, was brilliantly made, with wonderful, although horrible acts of war. Explosions, flight scenes which takes my breath away, and the ocean scenes. Not a lot of music was played, which to me made a great impact.All in all, I have to give this film ten stars, for the cast, the action, a great story for both sides, and above all the implication at why war is so unnecessary. Even the emperor himself was opposed like I mentioned before. I highly recommend this to anyone over age 14. You will be surprised by its remarkable scenery, and grandiose scale.

Even the rumblings from Adolf Hitler in Germany meant nothing to the U.S.&#x97;for a while, anyway. When Japanese emperor Hirohito ordered a surprise attack on America's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941, however, America woke up to a new kind of reality, as the war was bought to their very doorstep. This was the story told with frightening accuracy, from both sides of the conflict, in the multi-national 1970 World War II epic TORA! TORA! TORA!Based on Gordon Prainge's book Tora! Tora! Tora! and Landislas Farago's book The Broken Seal, this well-mounted movie, which, at a cost of $25 million, was among the most expensive films made in Hollywood up to that time, focuses, on the way the Imperial Japanese navy prepared to do what its emperor was ordering of it, and the way the American military staff in Hawaii were trying to understand what they were up to. The truth of the matter is that America and Japan had both been at odds for some time over various issues regarding China and control of commerce in the Pacific at the time; both nations had been devastated by the Great Depression. Negotiations between the two countries were going on between the two for much of 1941; and if Japan could not get what it considered a fair deal from a country that was still largely considered isolationist and inferior in the eyes of the world, then it would take it all by force. As far as the American military was concerned, there was no indication that a sneak attack of any kind was imminent on them; and it was assumed diplomacy would work things out. It then came through a deciphering of secret Japanese communiques that an attack was under way; but by the time the deciphering was in the hands of the Pacific fleet staff, it was too late. Pearl Harbor was virtually destroyed in a matter of two hours; numerous battleships, including the Arizona, sank to the bottom; and almost 2,500 people were killed. It was the greatest single loss of life in any attack on the United States...until September 11, 2001, of course.It would have been tempting for 20th Century Fox, the studio that funded and distributed this film, to make it a jingoistic piece of propaganda and paint the United States as the victim (even the 2001 blockbuster PEARL HARBOR, a near-enough remake of TORA! TORA! TORA!, flirted with that); but, like on its 1962 classic THE LONGEST DAY, it avoided doing so. Instead, thanks to the participation of two prominent Japanese directors, along with veteran U.S. director Richard Fleischer (THE BOSTON STRANGLER; FANTASTIC VOYAGE), the film looks at the events leading up to December 7, 1941 from each side of the conflict, with the Japanese, including their revered Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Soh Yamamura), anxious to strike but knowing full well what it may mean for their empire in the end, and the Americans misreading Japanese intentions and disregarding the numerous warning signs until they are backed into a corner. The film gives equal credit to both sides, as befitting as accurate an account of history as Hollywood can muster.Featuring the Oscar-winning special effects work of L.B. Abbott, A.D. Flowers, and Art Cruickshank, TORA! TORA! TORA! also features solid actors like Jason Robards, Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Cotten, E.G. Marshall, Richard Anderson, George Macready, James Whitmore, Wesley Addy, Leon Ames, and others rounding out a fine cast, along with Goldsmith's always dependable scoring genius, which here combines American and Oriental themes in a unique way. By avoiding the romantic sub-plots and the gung-ho theatrics of the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced and Michael Bay-directed PEARL HARBOR, TORA! TORA! TORA! makes itself stay truly memorable, and will certainly make the viewer wonder just how certain wars throughout history get started. In the case of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to six months of victory for them in the Pacific before they were ambushed at Midway in June 1942, it was a combination of misreadings, misunderstandings, and (on the part of the Japanese) the nerves of riverboat gamblers that made history happen. And as TORA! TORA! TORA! makes abundantly clear, such is often the way history gets made.

Tora! is the Pearl Harbor story. The real story, not a fictionalized Hollywood romance which just happened to be taking place in Hawaii in 1941. No made up characters, plot lines or melodrama here. This is the real deal, the story of the men whose decisions and actions led to a date which will live in infamy. As such there aren't going to be much in the way of surprises. There's an inevitability to the film, everyone knows how the story ends. But the film still manages to be compelling, dramatic and entertaining. For a nearly two and a half hour long movie in which you know the ending from minute one that is no small feat.Tora! Tora! Tora! is in a way two different films, the Japanese one and the American one. The two movies within this one movie have different writers, directors, cinematographers and actors. This could have easily led to a very disjointed feel. But things come together rather smoothly. The two stories fit together remarkably well as they proceed along their parallel tracks, destined to come together in the skies above Hawaii on December 7. While there are a few recognizable faces in the cast there are no real stars, no characters who obviously stand out from all those around them. This is a case where the story is the star. The plot, not the performers, drives the film forward. Which is not to say the performances are not good, they certainly are. Each actor, American and Japanese, plays his historical part more than well enough to let you totally buy into the story. You see the decisions the true-life men made and realize how all the small decisions led inexorably to one of the most significant historical events of the modern age. On such small details can history turn. If there can be any complaint with the film it is that the buildup towards the day of the attack can be slow at times. There's an awful lot of historical information to get across and often the same information is shown twice, from both the American and Japanese perspective. But a somewhat slow pace is a small price to pay for the painstaking historical accuracy the film achieves. It would be hard for a documentary to tell the Pearl Harbor story any more truthfully or any better. And however long the film took to get to December 7 the final payoff is no doubt worth it. The film's conclusion, inevitable though it may be, is breathtaking. Action on a grand scale, a powerful ending to a thoroughly compelling film. "},{"Title":"USS Yorktown in TORA! TORA!

But one can hardly fault that considering the wealth and breadth of material to be covered. I think it was insightful to show both the US and Japanese perspectives in the film. It helps one better understand the motives and strategies of both sides. The first half views more like a documentary. It's not until the last half that the action really gets going.I think all the actors did a fine job portraying their characters. I'm glad they forewent casting big name heartthrobs and instead opted for lower key character actors. I think it was also a good decision to have the Japanese speak in their own language for a more realistic depiction. However, if subtitles bore you, this probably isn't the film for you.It's interesting to note that this film was a flop when released in the US but was a huge success in Japan. This ties in with the fact that the US Navy office was inundated with complaints that they allowed US service persons to participate in the filming - they felt it glorified the Japanese aggression and showed the US as bumbling idiots that were unprepared.

You won't find better action footage in any WW II film and there's plenty of it too! We (Americans) clearly got our behinds tromped during the Pearl Harbor invasion but, because this is an American film, that facet of actuality is slightly played down, (micro victories by individuals are featured to counter our overall demise), as is Roosevelt's alleged desire to enter the war minimized, (my 90 year-old aunt asserts that FDR was Satan himself, I think mostly due to how our family members, during the conflict, were fruitlessly lost and suffered as POWs).In any event, the scenes herein shift between Washington D.C. political activities and those of the Pearl Harbor principals. Of course, the Japanese planning and action sequences are similarly featured.The film is shot in letterbox and runs 144 minutes in length. Excellent color saturation, with great casting (bulging with big period stars), top scenery, believable script, 70 mm cinematography, and awesome sets all contribute to the aggregate success of this exceptional film. It's all very realistic and not hokey in any sense. A lot of the footage, where the Japanese are speaking, is subtitled in English but it's well-done and not at all distracting. Compare it to the German subtitles in The Longest Day.I can't convey enough good comments about this movie. If you are even just a casual movie viewer of common genres, you'll probably much enjoy this well-made historical film, albeit some dramatic artistic license was tastefully invoked by the directors, Richard Fleischer, Kinji Fukasaku, and Toshio Masuda .I do recommend that you have the movie Midway, (a sort of historic Act II), ready at hand to watch following Tora!

No Japanese battleship survived the war but in the opening credits of Tora that's a Japanese Navy battleship. They made a life size mock-up !

For example, the PBY aircraft that was being flown was a later version, but none of the aircraft of the type that were actually at Pearl Harbor survived to when the movie was being filmed.There were also some minor issues with uniforms but I can't remember all of that, except for the scene on the U.S.S. Ward where enlistedmen are on the bridge in working uniforms and not whites. I was told that was a definite error in the peace-time Navy.An earlier comment about how the aircraft carrier scenes were filmed. The production company rented the U.S.S. Yorktown and flew the aircraft off of it. The Yorktown was decommissioned about a year after the movie was filmed.If you look closely in the background, there is a destroyer with an American flag. Further behind the destroyer is a Russian trawler who came along for the ride.Most of the aircraft that are seen being destroyed on the ground are mock-ups built for the express purpose of being destroyed. That's why they look so real.The battleships U.S.S. Nevada and the U.S.S. Arizona are one in the same. It was a full sized model that was mounted on a barge. It was used as the U.S.S. Nevada for the initial attack and then for the run across the harbor.At the end of the filming, it was destroyed to similate the destruction of the U.S.S. Arizona.Another interesting point about the movie, the scene of the B-17 landing on 1 main wheel is real. The plane had a hydraulic failure during the filming and was forced to land on 1 main wheel. The plane was heavily damanged but was repaired and flew again, but not until after the movie was completed.

You will learn that Akira Kurosawa was the original director of the Japanese scenes, and why he was fired (there are several really amusing/telling anecdotes here).  TTT stands up to the passage of time, because it so consistently presents itself as docudrama.  I recently rented The Guns of Navarone, on a nostalgia kick, and could barely sit through it, though I thought I remembered liking it when it first came out.  The special effects were terrible, the acting was overwrought, the big scene where the traitor is revealed (literally) now lacks punch, etc.  But TTT's action sequences are as good as anything you see today, and really better, because what you see on film REALLY HAPPENED (planes explode, shoot machine guns, etc.).  The even-handed moral tone is actually quite refreshing, portraying the Japanese military characters in a reasonably realistic and sympathetic manner.  The American characters appear quite flat (compare TTT to Thirteen Days, for instance), but you can't have everything.

I want to add here that this was a fine film of a great and terrible event, and certain aspects stand out for me.The very professional Japanese Navy was depicted accurately and with deserved respect. The internal conflicts within it between carrier and battleship advocates was also shown, as was Jap. admiral Nagumo's lack of decisiveness and rigidity in not launching a second wave to knock out the U.S. dry docks and oil storage facilities on Oahu island. The responsibility for the surprise in Washington was left unclear (it still is to large degree), although the film does tend to the accumulation of bad luck hypothesis rather than a diabolical plot. The inclusion of FDR (not in the movie) would have been inappropriate it would have been a distracting impression and he was not directly involved in the operations  - unless you believe FDR was diabolically pulling all the strings behind the scenes!The battle scenes were quite good, but the USAAF did not just have P-40 fighters in Hawaii, the only fighter depicted in the movie. The planes used to depict Zero fighters looked nothing like the real Japanese fighters (I guess it couldn't be helped). The capsizing of the USS Oklahoma was not shown, nor were there any good full shots of US battleships; I suppose that too couldn't be helped, but it was vexing. The destruction of the USS Arizona was well done. These are of course minor complaints.  I also wish the cast was a little stronger, and characters like Yamamoto and US Adm Kimmel, whose career ended after the attack, were better drawn. The film covered so much territory that many characters seem to be superficial. But that too is a minor complaint. I saw this movie initially at a packed large theater in Times Square and there was great reaction and involvement by the audience. It's a heck of a movie, and I just wish that Midway was made in a similar style with Japanese characters portrayed by Japanese actors speaking Japanese, not American actors of Japanese descent speaking English!

As thousands of Pacific veterans can attest, they were serious, committed warriors, not cartoon characters.The World War Two generation in America regarded Pearl Harbor as a dastardly event, a sneak attack that was ethically the lowest of deeds. It contrasted sharply American ideal of fair play (a fatal liability in combat, an ugly truth that's seldom depicted or discussed in films and literature of and about the period) and fed the vehemence of the American  people's terrible resolve, as Yamamoto put it.  That Japanese, a race too many Americans regarded with fear and suspicion, had accomplished it, further fueled American fury and determination.But militarily the Japanese were doing what historically they do best striking without warning to catch the adversary off guard and, if possible, defeat him with one decisive masterstroke.  If you're from another country, or if you're an American able to put your cultural baggage aside for the duration of the film, you gain a grim appreciation of just what a tatical masterpiece Pearl Harbor was, and how quickly the Japanse realized their strategic failure.Watching this film, you also glimpse how forward-thinking the Japanese were in naval developments, grasping the potential of naval air power over battleships.  (It's little known that in 1941, Japan's navy, particularly their naval air force, excelled America's in quality and quantity.) Even more, you discover how constrained Yamamoto's opportunities were.  He was essentially reduced to doing the Army's bidding rather than projecting power as a true blue-water naval force should, and he knew full well that against the might of America, the best he could do was to buy Japan a little time.To watch the Japanese cast members portray their roles is to see a valuable window on the Japanese warrior ethos in particular and Japanese culture in general.  For the Japanese, Pearl Harbor was the largest diplomatic and military gamble ever undertaken.  Its enormity manifests in the Japanese Navy officer corps' tension and emotion in scenes of planning and executing the strike. This tremendous acting is easily lost in visual translation for many Westerners, but it's palpable for those more familiar with the Japanese.

Rather than using the pending Japanese attack as the backdrop for a fictional romance, Tora Tora Tora faithfully recounts the events leading up to December 7, 1941, and then offers a chilling portrayal of the attack itself. In spite of being over 30 years old, the effects used during the attack scenes are excellent, and create the feeling that one is right there as they happen. The performances are solid although unspectacular, which seems appropriate. Clearly the desire of Directors Richard Fleischer and Kinji Fukasaku was to let the events speak for themselves, and in this they succeeded. The movie is told from both the Japanese and American points of view, and one of the better aspects of it was that the scenes on board the Japanese fleet were shot using the Japanese language, rather than having the Japanese speaking English with Japanese accents. I felt that this added to the authenticity of the movie. The confusion, miscommunication and poor preparedness of the U.S. is truthfully recounted, as is the division between the military and political machinery over various issues the choice of Pearl Harbor as the base for the Pacific Fleet, and the decision to transfer navy resources from the Pacific to the Atlantic.There are a few scenes that drag. We spent an inordinate amount of time watching Japanese Zeros taking off from the deck of a Japanese carrier and it's somewhat difficult to establish the timeline of the movie, particularly in the first hour or so, but overall this must surely be the definitive movie version of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Everyone interested in the day that will live in infamy should watch this.9/10 "}{"Title":"A Powerful Production","Date":"9 March 1999","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, History","Review":"  While Patton was the superior WWII film to be released in 1970, Tora! Tora! Tora!, a meticulous recreation of the events leading up to, and the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, is a fine film in its own right and is one of the best WWII epics.  The cast, on both the Japanese and American sides is excellent, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is powerful, and the special effects by 1970 standards are quite competent.I have only one complaint though, and that revolves around the strange decision not to depict Franklin Roosevelt in this film. Many people have said that Tora suffered at the box office because it left audiences too depressed upon leaving.  This could easily have been rectified had the producers recreated FDR's Day Of Infamy speech to Congress and recreated the wild, enthusiastic cheers of a determined America declaring war and vowing revenge and total victory.  But Roosevelt is nowhere to be seen in this film, and I don't think there's a legitimate excuse for this.

It doesn't attempt to add any fictional characters to the extent that this is possible or add steamy love scenes (2001's Pearl Harbor, I'm looking at you). The lesson here is never underestimate your enemy, and how easy that is to do when layers of bureaucracy are in the way, layers of bureaucracy that just can't believe that a nation of people that Americans then thought racially inferior would actually decimate Pearl Harbor to the degree that they did. Did you realize that in 1941 many Americans thought that Asians had poor eyesight because of the shapes of their eyes? I didn't learn that from the film, but it helps explain why so many prewar dramas were aimed at the Germans while the Japanese were practically ignored.Central to the plot is that U.S. Army Col. Bratton (E. G. Marshall) and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer (Wesley Addy) decipher the Japanese Purple Code and from the messages that they intercept, believe that attack is imminent. They pick the wrong week, but they have the right idea. As the warning goes up the chain of command so many things go wrong on the American side. Key generals or people reporting directly to the president are out riding horses or walking their dogs or doing what people do on weekends. Finally, Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark (Edward Andrews) is notified and urged to call Hawaii, but no, he says he wishes to call the president first. He asks everyone to leave the room. After everyone leaves Stark is staring at the phone but it is not clear if he ever called anyone. Why??? Meanwhile, Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam) is quite afraid of attack in the months leading up to December 7, but his reaction is counterproductive. He orders all aircraft placed as close together as possible so they can be easily monitored for acts of espionage. That's fine, but it also makes it easy for the Japanese to destroy all of them with a few bombs.The morning of December 7th, two ordinary soldiers are ordered to be up bright and early to man the new Radar Center that is only operational from 4AM to 7AM. They spot the entire airborne Japanese contingency via their equipment, inform their superiors, but are told it is probably just a malfunction - go have breakfast! And on and on it goes. When the Japanese planes finally do appear over the top of the harbor everyone believes they are American planes until the bombs start dropping.I haven't mentioned much about the Japanese mistakes, but there were a couple of doozies. The first being that the Japanese - due to a slow typist - did not deliver their ultimatum to the Americans in Washington until AFTER the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The second mistake is mentioned in the final line of the film, delivered by General Yamamoto, whose idea it was to stage this attack in the first place. He mentions that many think that the Americans are soft, that they love only luxury, that they are not hard and war-like as the Japanese are but he mentions he fears We have only awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.Something never mentioned in the film that helps explain some of the inertia on the American side is the anti-war and isolationist sentiment that was prominent in America up to Pearl Harbor itself. WWI was looked back upon as a gigantic waste of time and lives, and America was just emerging from a decade long Depression. Perhaps if Harold Stark never made that phone call it was because he thought that the Japanese dropping a few harmless bombs on Hawaii might get Americans into the fighting frame of mind necessary to fight a two front war. I don't think from anything I've ever read that anybody right up to Roosevelt believed that the Harbor and its contents would be completely destroyed.If you've never seen it, please do. And realize it was meant to be as close to a documentary of what actually happened as possible. Highly recommended.

"},{"Title":"Epic history as it should be made","Date":"23 February 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, History","Review":" Tora Tora Tora is one of the best war movies & historical dramas ever made. It has the ability to create an incredible tension, as events leading up to the attack unfold; which is all the more remarkable for a rather straightforward retelling of a historic event that everyone has at least a passing familiarity with. Tora is actually 2 movies in 1. The Japanese side, filmed in Japan using Japanese actors & crew, and the American side. Producer Elmo Williams & director Richard Fleischer then edited them together, showing the unfolding events as seen from both Japanese& American eyes. Reading the backstory of this production, I found out that 20th Century-Fox's Darryl Zanuck had been interested in this project back to the time he made The Longest Day, but several issues(including Zanuck's celebrated Cleopatra that nearly bankrupted the studio) kept it in project stage for years. Also, Japan's premier film director Akira Kurosawa (best known for The Seven Samurai) was originally engaged in writing & directing the Japanese portion. Considering Kurosawa's immense talent, it's odd that reportedly both Richard Zanuck (who took over running Fox from his father) and Elmo Williams were hugely disappointed with the rushes that were arriving from Japan. According to several credible sources, Kurosawa shot hours of footage, but Fox found they couldn't utilize any of it! Apparently Kurosawa was given large reign over writing the Japanese storyline, and took it off in directions Fox didn't like. Finally Kurosawa was fired, and they brought in a couple of journeymen directors to get the story in the can! One of the things which made for such realism was the Japanese built 2 life-size ship models/sets - of the carrier Akagi & the battleship Nagato (respectively, Nagumo's and Yamamoto's flagships) for filming key scenes. I've read where these 2 huge models became big tourist attractions while the Japanese sequences were being filmed. They were built right on a beach so that in the distance the ocean would be seen. I've been unable to find out definitively what happened to these giant sets, but I assume they were broken-up after filming was completed. I recall that in an issue of Sea Classics magazine after the movie's release it was reported that some of the large models of U.S. battleships used in the filming (in the 25-30 foot range) were being auctioned off. For the USS Arizona, they actually built a full-scale mock-up of the stern of the battleship, which was placed in battleship row not far from the Arizona Memorial.Tora also benefited from being made near enough in time to WWII that many old U.S. aircraft could be used in the film, and many old prop trainers were modified to serve as Japanese types. The special effects still hold up rather well, considering this was pre-CGI. I found many of the attack sequences (esp. those on the airbases) more convincing than the CGI used in 2001's Pearl Harbor! And, as far as story goes, there's simply no comparison. Tora! is realistic, and yet does manage to briefly show the exploits of the 2 real Army Air Force pilots who managed to get airborne and down some Japanese planes (Lts Welch and Taylor). There's no Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett dogfighting among the battleships' masts or airfield hangers, or playing chicken with each other to lead Japanese planes to crashing into one another! Special credit must go to the ensemble character of the cast. Fox avoided making a spot the star picture, such as their own The Longest Day, and concentrated on character and story. Some quality old actors (such as George Macready, Joseph Cotton, and Leon Ames), secondary types such as Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, and James Whitmore; and stalwart character actors like E.G. Marshall, Wesley Addy, Frank Aletter, Richard Erdman, Richard Anderson, Neville Brand, and many more. While many of the actors bear no more than a passing resemblance to their real-life counterparts (such as Balsam to Adm. Kimmel), George Macready is very close to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, as are the Japanese actors who play opposite him as Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu. One of the best-rendered and powerful scenes is where Hull receives the Japanese ambassadors just after he gets word of the Pearl Harbor attack. He gives them an icy dressing-down, then folds his hands and stares down at his desk as the Japanese depart. Another is the much-remembered scene at the end where Admiral Yamamoto points out to his assembled officers that the attack came 55 minutes BEFORE Japan's declaration was delivered in Washington, and tells them that he fears all they have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve. The movie ends with a somber restating of the main theme, showing a troubled Yamamoto gazing out over the sea, then dissolves to the flaming, smoking wrecks at Pearl Harbor, as the end credits role.Composer Jerry Goldsmith, one of the true greats of Hollywood, must get much credit, as well. Goldsmith was the master of percussion (such as his unusual but effective Planet of the Apes score), and used percussion to create a Japanese-themed score that helps build tension. Such music follows intel officers E.G. Marshall and Wesley Addy as they try to get someone in Washington to believe an attack on Pearl Harbor is imminent. No where is Goldsmith's mastery of setting score to scene better displayed than the final scene before intermission, where Adm. Stark (Edward Andrews) is at his desk in Washington, hesitating about whether to phone Hawaii with warning of the attack or not. We hear his desk clock ticking louder and louder as he looks down at his desk calendar with the iconic Sunday, December 7, 1941 date, and Goldsmith adds strings, which joins with clock ticks, steadily rising to a crescendo. One of the last chances to warn the Navy in Hawaii is draining away. Dynamite filmmaking and film scoring!

Forget PEARL HARBOR, TORA! TORA! TORA! is the real deal, a definitive retelling which makes all other versions of the story completely obsolete.Be warned this is a real slow-burner of a film, with lots of politics and bureaucracy and stuffy guys in suits chatting together in rooms. It's worth persevering with, though, because the pay-off, when it happens in the final hour, is well worth the wait. You can see why this film was so expensive to make, because much of the attack is done for real, with real planes throughout and real stuff blowing up. Even the use of miniatures is unobtrusive when it does happen.To be fair, the cast don't have a great deal to work with it's one of those ensemble productions where there are a few too many characters and none of them have time to make much of an impact. So if you're a fan of Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten et al, don't go into this expecting to see much of their work. In fact, the Japanese actors feel like they're the ones giving more naturalistic performances throughout as they get a chance to be more emotive.I especially like the way that the film slowly reveals a catalogue of errors on the part of the Americans, as the viewer gradually becomes aware that the attack wouldn't have been quite so unexpected had earlier signs and warnings been heeded. Altogether it's a great movie, one that rewards close attention with a fantastic pay-off.

It does not take the truth and corrupt it , as the overblown Pearl Harbor does, inventing a romance and inflating the Dorie Miller story so that Cuba Gooding Jr. could have more to do. The actors look like military people, not like the ones in Pearl Harbor who probably never served, unlike Jason Robards, who plays Gen. Short and was a actually a Pearl Harbor survivor, and Neville Brand, who plays Lt. Kennedy, and was a highly decorated WW 2 combat soldier. The build-up to the attack is long, what might say too long, and absolutely accurate, but it does slow down the movie. Unlike Pearl Harbor the movie which focused on three main characters, Tora, Tora, Tora gives a bigger canvas but does not leave us with any memorable performances. So in many ways, its strengths could be also classified as weaknesses.

To me the balance of both sides is well done.  Some of the characters over did it but it still it was great.  What I mean by overdoing it is that characters talk too much.  The special effects were very good espacially for being back in 1970.  Even though the effects we have now days are much more advanced and more realistic.  The scenes in the movie were absolutely marvelous.  In every scene the background looks real.  The battle scenes were not that great but yet,  the movie kept its focus and that's what I like about it.  I highly recommended it.

The one historical element left out of the movie is the Japanese spy system that identified the targets. This attack was probably the most pivotal event in the twentieth century. I believe that the movie suffered from too many characters and too much attention to accuracy in detail.

I sometimes watch this movie just to try and work out how they achieved their special effects.I found the events before the attack very tense and suspenseful. American military intelligence had cracked Japanese radio codes, and they were aware something was about to happen but didn't know where or when. They also had to convince their superiors of their suspicions.Surprisingly, this movie didn't do well when first released, and I often wonder why. I wonder if the docu-drama format, and lack of personal story-type snippets (like they used in The Longest Day) makes this movie a little dry for people who don't have an interest in what happened at Pearl Harbour or military history.

Tora! Tora! is three parts boring history and one part action movie.  If the movie's only goal was to be a drama about the attack on Pearl Harbor then maybe they would be right, but this is primarily a documentary.  We see all the mistakes, from the seemed a good idea at the time to the truly monumental, that led up to the attack.  Reality doesn't conveniently fit our notions of plot and drama, but does let us see why events happened as they did.Matters aren't perfect, as I've heard the Japanese bombers were attacking from about 10,000 feet, not off the deck as portrayed, and some of the ship scenes are obviously models, but considering the film's effort to be factual it can be given a little leeway.Some scenes stick forever in my mind, such as Yamamoto's words at the end about what the attack may have accomplished, and somberly walking out on the deck of his massive battleship, knowing it will all be swept away in the battles to come.  That last scene was more powerful than all the action sequences before it, and I think playing Yamamoto was one of Toshiro Mifune's best roles.  This is also a film that probably couldn't be made today, for two reasons.  First is there simply aren't enough serviceable World War Two era aircraft to make the flying squadrons coming in for the attack.  (Yes, I know the Japanese planes were built from American trainers--but those trainers dated from about the same time period.) Today, as with the awful Pearl Harbor movie last summer, everything would be CGI effects.  But no matter how good the special effects are they can't really catch the feel of a real airplane doing the same thing.  It's amazing they were able to do this as late as 1970, and the closest movie I can think of for a similar effect of real aircraft flying in the scenes is The Blue Max.Secondly is the film makers of the time could make a historical movie and simply tell the story.  Today it seems the set designs are perfect and the special effects get louder and more explosive, but the key elements are warped.  Too often we get characters and plot points changed to fit conventional standards of political correctness or exaggerated ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave.  It's a real shame as movies like Tora are few and far between.  The only thing that could have made this one better is if Akira Kurosawa would have been able to direct the Japanese segments.  As it is I rank Tora up with one of the top five war movies.

If you want to see the Bruckheimer/Bey version (reimagining?) of what happened, go rent Pearl Harbor. they've even thrown in a love triangle, for the benefit of those guys who love big explosions, but who's dates might not.

Actually, this is a very meticulous account of what happened on that fateful day. If you don't like documentary type films, go see Pearl Harbor. It's all here, from the band playing moments before the first Japanese wave struck, to the dramatic sinking of the Arizona. The climax of this film is the attack on Pearl Harbor but what really makes this effort shine is how the preceding events are portrayed. You can see the conflict between Japanese hawks, who want to go to war, and doves, who still seek a peaceful resolution. The film makers also did not feel the need to detract from the significance of the event (as Bey did) by ending the film on a jingoistic note by skipping 6 ahead to when Doolittle and company raided Tokyo. In doing so, Bey ignores several significant events related to the war (the capture of the Philippines, etc.) in order to give the film a Hollywood ending. Be forewarned, Tora! Tora! Tora! does not tell you what happened after Pearl Harbor.

If he had been, Tora! Tora! Tora! might have ended up as a bloated three- hour epic about a love-triangle involving Admiral Yamamoto, Admiral Kimmel and Tokyo Rose, with the attack on Pearl Harbor tacked on as an afterthought.Fortunately, he wasn't. The film we actually have takes a very different approach to that taken in Bay's Pearl Harbor. There are no fictional love stories, indeed virtually no fictional characters at all. Rather, the film documents the Japanese preparations for the attack and the efforts of the Americans to understand what the Japanese were planning. The title (meaning Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!) is the Japanese code-word used to indicate a successful attack.Although some well-known Hollywood names took part, including Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten and Jason Robards, there are no real star parts; this is very much an ensemble cast. One thing that struck me was how little James Whitmore, who plays Admiral William F. Halsey, resembled Robert Mitchum, who played the same role in Midway from a few years later; neither actor, in fact, looked much like the real Halsey. Any actor playing a major wartime army commander such as Patton or Montgomery would no doubt be carefully made up to resemble the man he was playing, but naval commanders seem to have been much less well-known to the public than their military counterparts, so such realism was presumably thought unnecessary. In many ways the film does not address the most interesting question about the attack, namely the question of why the Japanese leadership decided to take such a reckless gamble in the first place. Emperor Hirohito never appears, and General Tojo only appears briefly. The Japanese part of the film concentrates upon Admiral Yamamoto and his predecessor Admiral Yoshida, both of whom opposed war with the United States. It is implied that some Japanese leaders considered the Americans to be a spiritually corrupt, cowardly nation who would be unwilling to carry on fighting once their Pacific Fleet had been destroyed. It is also implied that the Japanese suspected the Americans of plotting an aggressive war against their country, especially after the Pacific Fleet was moved to Pearl Harbor from its normal base in San Diego, and therefore began planning a pre-emptive strike of their own. The film, however, never comes down definitively in favour of either explanation, possibly because it was an American&#x96;Japanese co-production and the Japanese film-makers might have been unwilling to explore their country's responsibility for the war in too much detail.The film is more interesting when considering events from the American viewpoint. Contrary to popular opinion, the attack did not come as a complete surprise. The Americans suspected the possibility of a Japanese attack, having deciphered a key Japanese code which allowed them to read diplomatic communications. Remarkably, the Americans actually fired the first shots of the day when a U.S. destroyer sank a Japanese submarine trying to enter Pearl Harbor, but reports of this incident were not passed to senior commanders while more junior officers awaited official confirmation.The film, in fact, tries to rehabilitate the reputations of Admiral Husband Kimmel (I wonder if Mrs Kimmel ever used to refer to my husband Husband) and General Walter Short, the two officers who were made scapegoats for the disaster. The Americans certainly had enough information to anticipate the attack, but owing to a combination of incompetence and mischance this information was not passed to the two commanders on the ground until it was too late. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck described the film as taking a revisionist approach which showed what really happened on December 7, 1941.None of the many individuals depicted here emerge as really interesting characters; I suspect that this is more a film for the military or history buff than for the general viewer. As such, however, it works very well, and the action scenes showing the attack are extremely realistic; the aerial dogfight sequences will bear comparison with those in The Battle of Britain from the previous year. I greatly prefer the sober, documentary approach taken by Zanuck and director Richard Fleischer to Bay's overblown, turgid love-story. 7/10 "},{"Title":"An excellent dramatisation, but still quite onesided","Date":"21 December 2013","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, History","Review":" The thing that stands out in this movie is the half hour long battle of Pearl harbour. This movie is a historical recreation of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour and it is incredibly close to the actual events. It more of a documentary done in the way of a film. The thing is that there are quite a few issues which are of historical significance in this film and that are explored. They are the relationship between the United States and Japan, the US unwillingness to go to war, and the arrogance of the United States into believing that nobody would even consider attacking them, and finally how the people at the top did not realise the extent of the threat while the people at the bottom could inevitably see it coming.The first time I saw this movie was in year 11 during Modern History. The thing that stuck out was the length of the attack on Pearl Harbour, and it was really cool. I remember this one sailor firing this huge machine gun at Japanese planes. Another scene is where a Japanese plane flies over a parade ground, and the reaction of the commander there is that it was some American fly-boy being funny - that is until it drops a bomb.The issue behind the events were in regard to dominance of the Pacific Rim. The Japanese wanted to establish a Pacific Empire, but the problem was that America considered the Pacific Ocean to be theirs, and there was no room for the two super powers to share. The Japanese were feeling pressured by the Americans with their war in China, especially since they ceased trading with them forcing them to either push the Americans out of the picture or to move into South-East Asia. They chose the second option but the Americans reacted very badly to that so they decided that they needed to move on the Americans.The thing that gets me is that throughout the movie we see the Americans as being the good guys and the Japanese as being the facists. What we do not see is the way that the Americans treated the Negroes, the Mexicans, or even the Indians. This was not a war of good against evil, but rather two superpowers fighting over something that they did not want to share. The Americans condemned Japan for its actions in China, yet no mention of the American's actions in their land against the Indians - first of all invading their territories and then displacing them into reserves and even assimilating them. The Negro issue regarding slavery had been sorted out, but they were still considered second class citizens. The American Secretary of Defense condemned the Japanese Ambassador for his nation's actions and made him look like a bad boy, but it is more like a bully forcing a weaker kid to admit that he is the bad person and that the bully is the good person. In my books, nobody is good or bad, but we are all as corrupt as everybody else.The next issue I will address is the belief that America would not be attacked, which I will combine with the difference between the generals and the people at Pearl Harbour. Constantly we are shown how nobody expects Japan to attack. The first event is when the planes in the airbase are grouped togeather to prevent sabotague, yet wise commanders realise that this is bad because an attack could wipe them all out - which it did. Another incident is when the planes are spotted on Radar, but they are ignored because they must be American planes. Nobody was expecting that Japan would make such a bold move, though evidence pointed out that it would happen. The Americans had cracked their codes and were receiving all of the messages. They knew that a fleet had moved out but did not act on it. They had even sunk a submarine just outside of Pearl Harbour, but considered it to be nothing, especially since there was no hard evidence. This couples with the unwillingness of the US to go to war that they would rather ignore the signs in hope that they would not be dragged into a bloody conflict.The one thing that slightly irritated me is that President Roosevelt is never shown (though neither is the Japanese Emperor). It is as if the president is some sort of god symbol who cannot be portrayed on screen. It is probably not that, but that they did not want to go to the effort of trying to find somebody who looks like Roosevelt. It also gives the impression of the generals running the show and that the president simply says yes or no on the really important decisions, but only receives the information that the general wants them to know.This is a good movie. It is historically accurate and as such is a great movie to watch to try and understand the events leading up to Pearl Harbour. It is decidedly pro-American but that is what one should expect when approaching an American movie. "},{"Title":"A blockbuster built around facts.

For example, the movie showed the battleship California being abandoned before the Arizona had blown up.  In actuality, the California wasn't abandoned until around 900 a.m. which was well after the Arizona had blown up (it was the burning oil from the Arizona which forced the evacuation of the California). Also, the movie showed the bomb which destroyed the Arizona crashing into its stern, when in reality, it forward.  Another error, was when the acting captain of the USS Nevada said he would beach the ship over there.  In reality, it was Adm. Furlong who ordered him to stay clear of the channel for fear of the ship sinking and bottling up the fleet.  One more error appeared toward the beginning of the movie when Adm.

The Last Year,'80(TV) was very ill informed and was not capable to utilize his great ability to assist in stopping the blood shed! There was too much Red Tape and America did not really want to get involved with Japan, as well as fighting with Nazi Germany!  Joseph Cotton,(Sec. of War, Henry L. Stimson),Niagara,'53 and E. G.

The Japanese Air Force was short on fuel for their planes, and they were just able to drop their bombs and if they ran out of fuel, they flew their planes into the ships and buildings in order to accomplish their mission. The Japanese Aircraft Carrier was able to get them as close as they could, but fuel was a problem for the Navy & Air Force at the time.  As early as 1937, the Japanese Nation invaded China, where they did horrible crimes against the People of China, The Rape of Nanking was remembered in the War Crimes Court after the War.  This is a very good film about WAR, and I hope and pray that WAR among people and Nations will come to an END!  Unfortunately, Harry S.

It is well-made and it is definitely interesting as American and Japanese film-makers collaborated to tell what really happened at Pearl Harbor. The events leading up to the attack are given lots and lots of background while the attack itself is pretty impressive considering this film was made in 1970. In all there may be a little too much information as the film is slow-moving in some areas as the big-name cast sometimes distracts from the actual message the directors wanted to convey. Overall the film is a near miss. The split between the American viewpoint and the Japanese viewpoint makes for some innovative film-making but too many times the film has more of a voyeuristic feel than the feel of watching a motion picture. In other words, there is just too much reality sometimes as the most boring of sequences are prevalent throughout and this makes the film way too long. Tora! Tora!

But after two weeks of shooting, he was replaced by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku, who directed the Japanese sections. What would have been different? Roger Ebert felt that Tora! Tora! Tora! was one of the deadest, dullest blockbusters ever made and suffered from not having some characters to identify with. In addition, he criticized the film for poor acting and special effects in his 1970 review. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, was similarly unimpressed, noting the film was nothing less than a $25-million irrelevancy. Now, I can see where Ebert and Canby are coming from. Indeed, it is long, and has no main character. From the point of view that movies are entertainment, this is not a good movie. But I think the film has somehow transcended that. I first saw it in school as a way to be introduced to Pearl Harbor and World War II. Did I fully comprehend what I saw? No. And is it 100% accurate? Probably not.

One of my hesitations which turned out to be completely unnecessary was a common complaint I have with war films - they often throw in some romantic element completely unnecessary for the historical record to receive it's proper treatment. Case in point, 2001's Pearl Harbor which also concerned itself with the Japanese attack that ignited our engagement in World War II. With Tora! Tora! Tora! I was impressed with the near documentary story telling style, offering an inside look at both the Japanese and American approaches to an impending conflict.I recently happened to catch the original full version of the 1943 documentary December 7th, commissioned by President Franklin Roosevelt to help explain what happened before, during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A good deal of what's shown in that film provided key elements in the subject movie being discussed, with particular emphasis on the number of Japanese living on the Hawaiian Islands. One of the military leaders mentions it here, I think it was Lt. Colonel Bratton (E.G. Marshal) but if not, please excuse. The reason I bring it up is because the film incorporates quite clearly any number of Japanese characters in civilian roles, particularly in military offices as well as domestic help, including General Bratton's own houseboy. The fear of local Japanese sabotage was always quite clearly in mind by the powers that be.The movie offered a couple of surprises, the primary one being that no stock footage of the actual Pearl Harbor attack was used in the production. I thought that might have been an element. Another surprise was that even though the President was mentioned a number of times, there was no actor employed to portray Roosevelt. I thought that was kind of interesting, particularly since FDR almost immediately convened Congress to declare war at the time. But then again, the movie was depicting the day of and not the aftermath.As far as the actual battle scenes, the recreations for the film are simply staggering in an era before CGI and mesmerizing special effects. They aptly convey the horror of war and the chilling resolve of the Japanese kamikaze pilots to inflict a mortal blow to America. Though it wasn't specifically mentioned in the picture, the actual attack lasted just ten minutes shy of two hours, and delivered a devastating blow to America's naval capacity in the Pacific. What it led to was Japanese Admiral Yamamoto's (So Yamamura) prescient observation that the Japanese Empire had awakened a sleeping giant. The march of history was about to be changed for the next seventy years.

The actual attack is just as spectacular, but the poorly directed pre-attack scenes now look quite professional, whereas in cinemas all the instant information dialogue of the movie's first half (stiffly delivered across the 70mm screen), failed to make any impact. Fan spotters, however, are still going to be disappointed. Joseph Cotton has a minuscule role, while both Jason Robards and James Whitmore have only a mite more footage. Fortunately, Martin Balsam turns in his usual capable job as Kimmel, but the real star of the American segment, apportioned by actual lines and amount of footage, is probably Wesley Addy. Nevertheless, for those who like spectacular scenes of destruction on a grand scale, the movie will be a godsend. It's odd to see an anti-Japanese movie co-produced by a Japanese film company, but that's what we have here. What we do not have however, are all the anti-American scenes seen in the movie's theatrical version in which reports of the imminent attack by USA spotters are ignored by the stupid officers in Honolulu. Some of these scenes are still in the DVD film, but not all of them. Half the staff at base command should have been arrested and court-martialed, but as far as I'm aware, they were not!

Despite the extensive damage inflicted on the US battleship fleet this was ultimately largely irrelevant.For anyone interested in the origins, execution and aftermath of the PH attack this is a great starting point. There is a wealth of information on the internet, both truthful and fanciful for anyone wanting to learn more but this movie provides a better grounding than any documentary I have seen.

But for a good essay on this specific historical event, no movie (that I've seen, anyway) does better justice to Pearl Harbor. It really is both an American and Japanese coming to terms with a very important historical event, with both of them taking the time to acknowledge just how much they messed up. Pearl Harbor was one of those events both stunningly planned and disturbingly coincidental. A different move in any different direction could have created a massively different outcome. In a way, that retrospect makes Tora! Tora! Tora! a little too knowing, as any time a decision is made by a character on-screen, the connotation is that that decision was directly causal to a specific outcome as to what happened, whereas other outcomes that decision caused are not explored because they no longer have the significance of what-could-have-been but only what-actually-did.This is the type of movie where every penny of a big Hollywood budget went on screen for good effect. The actual attack is both stunningly detailed and entertainingly spectacular, but even the inclusion of real stunt people so close to the explosions and actions makes a very realistic effect and helps give emotional scale to the attacks. The madness and confusion in such a well-coordinated and planned out action is a beauty to behold in and of itself.This is a fantastic movie and a pretty good essay revealing the workings and design of a now infamous event. Sure, it's not without its over-simplifications (the cryptography lab, for instance, is laughably small for the type of work they were doing), and as always any specialist will probably find nitpicks, but for the casual viewer it's much better than anything else I've seen out there. I mean, From Here to Eternity is a great movie but one does not learn a whole lot about the actual operations of the attack (because that's not its focus), and Pearl Harbor is stylisticly pleasant to look at but is maudlin and ridiculous (mostly because I think Bay was aiming for a sort of Titanic-esquire love story to give it more seriousness, and failed miserably).

But the material given to the masses is just plain poor.Four days from now my nation, the United States of America, will once again ponder briefly that December 7th some sixty-years ago, when my parents and their parents were witness to the times that shook this nation to its very foundation, and was met with the traditional strategy of war conceived and execute by Imperial Japan's military elite.Why some of the big names in film reviews have given this film a pass is beyond me. It truly is. Those people, Americans even, seem to miss the point; the event portrayed in this film IS the drama that takes place. So what exactly happened? Let's start with the historical material.Japan's expansionism to create is Economic Prosperity Sphere by trying to thrust its jingoism on East Asia as a whole, has brought the eyes of the world upon it. It's military adventures into Korea and China have seen some of the most horrid atrocities perpetrated by soldiers on common citizens since Ghengis Kahn. I remember hearing an interview with a former Japanese soldier who was in China during Japan's occupation of the coast. He tells of how he and his comrades bayoneted a screaming baby, and tossed it on a fire and laughed. It made me sick. The sexual enslavement of Korean women, the wanton brutalization of a people by a foreign power has nary been equaled since the age of the Roman Empire.But, for all this, the United States did not go to war with Japan. Nations go to war only when their interests are threatened. So it was that Japan saw US sanctions (largely an oil embargo against Japan) as retribution for their actions in China, which is exactly what that sanction was all about. The solution, seek out a new source of oil in the South East Pacific.Ah, but the American fleet is stationed at Hawaii, and can deploy to the Philippines at a moment's notice. In fact, said fleet is seen as a dagger (or samurai sword) pointed straight at Japan. Solution; execute what the Pentagon would call in Cold War parlance as the pre- emptive-first-strike-initiative; i.e. attack the forces at Hawaii, specifically take out the carriers to deny naval aviation assets, then seize the oil in the south east pacific, and fortify so that when the American's rebuild their carrier forces you'll be ready for them.This plan, of course, hinges all upon sinking (or putting out of commission) the US Navy carrier task forces. It was not to be, and the Japanese lost by winning the first battle of Pacific Theatre. Or rather, not wining it as they had hoped and needed to win.The drama we see unfold in the film is the drama of international relations. It's the story of how tiny cogs in a giant clockwork are relevant on all levels. One could call the exposition in this film The Application of the 'Butterfly Effect' in the Second World War, for we see how small seemingly insignificant actions taken and not taken by various actors resound throughout the film, and tally to the ultimate and final climax.Cinematically this film is outstanding. Not a singly shot is wasted. Some of the SFX may look a little poor here and there, but beyond some minor split screen work and a few models for the Japanese Navy, everything else IS REAL. The stunt work in this film is insane. It is outrageously stunning to see stunt men get close to pyrotechnics the way these guys did. Or to see stunt pilot fly a few feet off the ground as they strafe some target.I missed the film in the theatre, but saw it every time it hit the airwaves; specifically on December 7th, usually on KTVU Channel 2 in the San Francisco Bay Area.The acting is outstanding. Not overstated, but dramatic where needed. The actors hit their marks superbly. I think Jason Robarts flubs a line with the STIVIL population instead of the civil population, but you hardly notice it. In fact, maybe he meant to say that... sort of him channeling a real human speech flaw from the former Army chief at Hawaii. There are many a familiar face in this drama, and some not so familiar, but who would become well known.This is not a guy film. I mean, it is, but only in the sense that it's men who are leading and taking part in the action. This is a time of men, and how their decisions and actions will effect the world for the next one-hundred years (possibly longer). Even so, I would be hard pressed to find a single woman, make that fully mature (emotionally, physically, psychologically) woman who doesn't find this film fascinating on all levels.Through all the destruction and diplomatic intercourse, you have to ask yourself, were you General George Marshal or Chief of the Army Tojo, would you have done any different in their shoes? If you were Admiral Yamamoto, would you have defied Tojo, appealed to the Emporer, or done your duty? How important is it to you that your people survive and/or win out over another people? Because that's what this film ultimately asks the audience.Is war worth it?That's something only you can answer for yourself.Tora Tora Tora makes no pretense about answering such a weighty question, but shows the short comings and long term effects of decisions that makes a certain day forever live in infamy.

MASH obviously went on to inspire Robert Altman's fizzling career and an equally empty-headed TV show.  Catch-22 is more concerned with insanity, but hasn't inspired as many follow-ups.  Kelly's Heroes is obviously in tune with Three Kings and many more recent movies while Patton is a grandiose precursor to Saving Private Ryan.  Both are less-than-liberal patriotic attempts of denouncing war.  As for Tora! Tora! Tora!, the Discovery and History channels have descended from it.  Descended being the key word.Tora! Tora! Tora! resembles The Longest Day in that it is about an event and not about people.  There is no suspense, no character development, no plot twists or plot holes.  Anyone with a history book can follow along and stay two steps ahead of the story.Nonetheless, Tora! remains Hollywood's best attempt at being impartial without being stupid like We Were Soldiers.  You can see many cases where Michael Bay tried duplicating or enhancing many shots, all to lesser effect.  CGI is a poor substitute to the extensive model work here, it is far more convincing and realistic.  The camera is wonderfully manipulated to take full advantage of all the powers and shortcomings of the production, but do not create the same atmosphere as Patton.Enough of the pyrotechnics, Jerry Goldsmith creates an interesting parallel score.  Traditional oriental music with the Japanese, more Western style with the Americans.  He even adds some militaristic pomp for the Hamburg Pact signing.  The editing is tremendously subpar, though.  The ambition that Fox put into this is remarkable given the time of release.  No wonder it bombed...it condones war under certain circumstances.Overall, between Tora! Tora!

In fact, this is way too slow, and this leads to a drag and then to a boredom. Another obvious moment that stands out is a deliberate detached, withdrawn, subdued and hushed attitude to all the procedure. It seems that we witness some cold, steady spectacle of death, but with no real compassion or misery. The whole attack scene is shown with all sheer reality, brutal honesty and shocking detail, but still it is done so that we feel not much but some detachment off the suffering. As if we see the whole war through a thick pane of glass. One huge drawback is a relatively weak performance by almost all the actors, and it often hurts and leaves a gaping Why on our lips. What else can we say? Watch this as a real curio and a example of later Pearl Harbor kitsch to come, with all its prolonged battle scenes and hammy love line, and also watch this as a curious instance of a decent but still underdeveloped movie with a great potential but missed details here and there.

It is truly a film to be rivaled, and not many should step up to challenge this film of an even greater grandeur scale. No film should look to Tora! Tora! Tora! without reverence and a genuine thankfulness that we are alive enough to see a film such as this. Thank you.

Yes, there might be no improbable romances in Tora! Tora! Tora! but the depiction  of the attack is far superior in Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor showed that people died horribly in the attack or suffered terrible injuries. The attack in Tora! Tora! Tora! is just a lot of exploding ships and the scenes at Wheeler Field where P-40s are destroyed as they attempt to take off just seems to aim at sensationalism. I wonder if, in the scene where the P-40 blows up and its propellor goes bouncing across the runway, the propellor was rigged to come flying off while the engine was racing in order to create a more sensational effect. There is a very brief scene where sailors are shown trapped below decks in a sinking battleship but they are quickly rescued and sailors with their clothes on fire are rapidly doused. I'm not saying the film should have been gory but it should have shown what a terrible event Pearl Harbor was. The run up to the attack is a very staid history lesson about the diplomatic exchanges that were taking place between Washington and Tokyo. When the attack does begin there is some tension but the treatment of the attack is somewhat flippant. Geisha girls are seen waving and calling to the pilots of the Nakajima B5N2 Kates as they engage in practice torpedo runs and a Japanese angler grumbles about Navy pilots attracting geisha girls but frightening the fish. Other instances of flippance are the scene where the formations of Japanese aircraft form round a Boeing Stearman from a flying school, where an Aichi D3A1 Val flies over two US Navy officers and one of them threatens to report the pilot for safety violation and then it releases its bomb and when the B-17 pilot comments what kind of air traffic control is this when he flies into a formation of Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeroes. A publicity brochure for the film says that the producers sought to cast actors who strongly resembled the historic figures they portrayed but only the actors playing ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu bear a really close likeness to the people they are portraying (though there is an uncredited actor in the scene in the Berlin Chancellry who is absolutely spot on for Ribbentrop). Martin Balsam is not really like Admiral Kimmel (though having said that, Colm Feore who plays him in Pearl Harbor isn't that like him either. And he's also about 20 years too young) and the Japanese actor playing Tojo has too much hair. The real Tojo looked a bit like an oriental version of Alf Garnett. I think this film aimed at making entertainment out of a terrible event and, as I said, it disregards the terrible loss of life. After one time it was shown on BBC television in the early 1980s a woman wrote into the  Sunday Post newspaper and said the film would not be a pleasant experience for the relatives of those who lost there lives. It's an event which still reduces old people to tears and Michael Bay's film is a tribute which shows Pearl harbor and war in general as a terrible experience.

Tora! Tora! is well made but lacks any real human element. This prevents it from being a really good film as opposed to just an average war flick. On the positive side, this is one of the most painstakingly researched war films of the era. It comes across as being possibly the most accurate out of any. Every character and action here really did happen, and the character descriptions at the bottom of the screen (something done first by The Longest Day) helps with the understanding. Its very well directed and a good film to watch if you're doing a school project on the topic.What it lacks unfortunately is any human element. I was never able to get caught up or find any excitement for the majority of the film. The characters are all from textbooks and underdeveloped (with the possible exception of Jason Robards). The cast is superb and tries their best with a lot of uninteresting characters. For scholars this will be fascinating. For the average movie goer, it will be dull.The film only really comes to life during the final attack. This is when we get the full understanding of exactly why this was a day that lived on in infamy. Its one of the most impressive and tense sequences of a battle ever and manages to be so without any bloodshed presented on screen. Overall, Tora! Tora! Tora! is flawed as a film if not as a history lesson. Its still much better than the abyssal Pearl Harbor.

Attack! Attack! is too imbalanced-a war film to be anything above mostly interesting at best and a tad plodding at worst; its first 60 minutes of dialogue and general recounting of events leading up to one of the more important, more infamous, events of the 20th Century does eventually give way to wall to wall second unit material as the deadly 1941 attack on the American Navy at Pearl Harbour plays out. The attack itself on Pearl Harbour as a historical footnote has, in the past, made for odd transition from real life to cinema screen. One could feasibly argue that the team behind Attack! Attack! Attack! had little alternative but to depict the overall narrative of will they/won't they, as trouble brew in Europe and tensions between The States and Japan seemingly intensify, as they did how else does one construct the tale behind (and then the consequent attack of) said Naval port? One approach is to first and foremost make a character drama in the mould of From Here to Eternity or Pearl Harbor, before having the attack proper play out in the final act; other films (albeit I know them exclusively through name and reputation) deal with it through respective lens' of comedy and moral dilemma in 1941 and The Final Countdown.It is with this in mind that I identify the difficult means by which to depict the underpinning narrative of the Pearl Harbour ambush, Attack! Attack! Attack! coming to form a sort of docu-drama without the docu.; a film apparently sticking so true to how these true-to-life American and Japanese military dignitaries acted that a shorter project having the actual personnel in front of the camera giving us their accounts would've been more interesting. I see the film's hypothesis as one that details War not as a state of Hell and madness, but as one exclusively of madness - doing so through its retelling of the terrible misjudgements that were made in order to induce this state. Characters react to information without the conviction required to actually do something about it; they anticipating the terror, but do not ever seem to have everyone reading from the same page, whereas the half-hearted and inherently vain mind-sets of either side are encapsulated in the Japanese's ultimate mistake to have the gall to go through with this kamikaze operation, but not being brave enough to go the whole distance and finish the enemy off when you've come this far anyway.The film's immediate beginning is loud and dramatic, a crash over the soundtrack as the title flies towards us with a sort of whooshing noise &#x96; eventually giving way to two Japanese aircrafts whirling around in the air near to one of their own Naval bases, thus instilling that sense of surprise or being caught off guard in lieu the nature of what will go on to be depicted. Indeed, for all of that during its sudden opening, it is worth pointing out just how calm the film is actually for the most part; there are men, in offices, speaking and relaying exposition. Enforcing varied difference between the two sides are the often static Japanese, who stand around robotically donning plain clothing. By comparison, the Americans are up and all over the place with a great deal of camera movement reinforcing the overlying atmosphere of nervousness and uncertainty as they fear the apocalyptic unknown may be coming.But the film has a balanced agenda throughout in its depiction of both the Americans and the Japanese, something that never feels more concurrent than during its opening sequence a conversation involving a Japanese admiral and how his policies clash with that of potential European allies The Nazis, not to mention the internal problems between the Navy and Army in which they disagree on the potential of going to war. It is here the Japanese are depicted as wary or threatened or even scared. They take note of the Americans moving their huge Navy fleet to the remote Pacific outpost of Hawaii, and react. Recall, if you will, that this is at a time when Hawaii was not yet an American state, so for the Japanese to observe the Americans manoeuvre this firepower to, what I think, was just a collection of neutral tropical islands in the middle of the ocean, you can get an understanding of where they were coming from.If pacing is the issue, director Richard Fleischer does his best to try and make it otherwise with the very early introduction of a top secret decoding room wherein Japanese messages are tapped. On the wall beside it sits an exclusive list of those permitted entry while as the film wears on, and the attack nears, only then do the various people on that list begin to have their tales depicted. That is to say as each personnel, whose presence in the room that will ultimately bring about the realisation the Japanese air force are about to induce the very reason The Second World War shifted in its overall dynamic, gradually appears for their depiction, we sense the rushing through the ranks of those on screen surging as the historical deadline approaches and these people charged with foiling it can't quite nail their task. To the extent of the film being a burning, brooding drama of unavoidable tragedy, it works and I find it hard to speak overtly negatively of it because I was mostly absorbed in spite of the run time and in spite of knowing the ending.

It's competently directed. A monumental amount of money was spent on it. It's as historically accurate as the limits of commercial film making allowed. It's about an event of great magnitude. The director considers it one of his best films.So why does it fall short of expectations? Maybe because the expectations are too high, given the effort that went into the production. After all is said and done, it's an attempt to recreate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and make a movie out of it. It's not the attack itself.We all realize that great care and lots of dough were lavished on the sets but they look cheesy nevertheless. The models are identifiably models. And historical errors abound, due to simple carelessness. The bombers and torpedo planes can pass, but the AT-6 Texan trainers do not look or fly like Zeros. (This is one instance in which CGI would have been a genuine help if used -- properly, not in the zany way of Pearl Harbor.)There's nothing wrong with most of the performances. The tension associated with the raid is forcefully conveyed. And there is one scene, in which the commander of the Japanese Air Group wordlessly shakes Fuchida's hand and Fuchida pauses for a moment, then smiles glowingly before mounting his airplane, that is thrilling. In small parts, Richard Anderson is a little too obvious, and poor Neville Brand is unbelievable as anything more than a flabby ex-actor. Jason Robards, by the way, who plays General Short, was a third-class radioman in the Navy at Pearl Harbor during the attack and actually copied the transmitted message, Air Raid Pearl Harbor. This is no drill. Soh Yamamura, as Admiral Yamamoto, is given a great line at the end of the film. I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. The line is so good, so portentous, so apt, that I've seen it attributed to Yamamoto as a direct quote, when in fact it was written expressly for the movie. It may become one of those factoids that, having been invented for fiction, are passed on as fact. The thumbs up and thumbs down gestures after gladiator brawls are in the same factoidal territory, having been invented on the spot for a silent film.It's not a bad movie, not poorly done, and it's light years ahead of Pearl Harbor. But there are enough errors of judgment in the direction, and a few in the script, to render it disappointing. Richard Fleischer actually believed that if you captured a P-40 careering out of control from five different angles and exploding spectacularly, scattering debris everywhere, the viewer would not realize it was the same incident being filmed from different angles and so could be used repeatedly. The viewer realizes and even feels a little cheated and condescended to.

Tora! premiered in late 1970, the critics went on a bomb-and-strafe mission. The movie was deemed an expensive dud, a costly waste of effort and money. Old-fashioned classical narratives were not in vogue during the Counterculture era in Hollywood. Indeed, when viewed within the historical context of the late '60s, Tora! Tora! Tora! does seem a throwback to a much earlier style of war-film. All that's missing is a rousing Max Steiner musical score to punctuate the action.The veteran director, Richard Fleischer, does try to make the film seem hip and anti-authoritarian. He exposes a laundry-list containing one diplomatic blunder after another, all of them leading up to a failure by America's power-structure to prevent the inevitable surprise air-attack &#x96; the movie's big set-piece. As a result, generals, admirals, cabinet-officers &#x96;- the entire elite &#x96;- are made to appear as incompetent as those in Dr. Strangelove. Tora! Tora! Tora! has that smug, cynical what-if-this-had-happened-instead-of-that appeal that can often cripple a historical film, especially one that purports to expose the Real Truth behind America's day of infamy. In this movie, the Japanese fare much better. The actors impersonating Yamamoto and company don't play their parts completely straight. While they may pose as disciplined, dedicated, and spirited warriors, they're never fanatical, never too stiff, and always quick with a joke. Still, the clever competence of the Japanese makes their American counterparts resemble Keystone Kops in army drag. Even Fleisher's direction is bested by his Oriental opposite-numbers, Fukasaku and Masuda. (According to Fleischer's autobiography, Akira Kurosawa was originally hired to helm the Japanese scenes. He proved such a tyrannical boss on the set, however, that the producers let him go after only two days of shooting. This might explain the loose, relaxed attitude of the Japanese actors.) And then there's the surprise raid itself. Certainly, it's an impressive staging. But to what purpose? Why did Richard Zanuck find it necessary to back this film and almost take Daddy's Fox Studios into bankruptcy? Besides, when compared to John Ford's documentary, The Battle of Midway (1942) -- a movie that's an act of bravery in itself -- Tora! Tora! Tora! is an emotional blank. It piles on its points of irony effectively; yet in the end, it conveys all the excitement of a burial detail &#x96; with just as much panache.

Tora! drinking game you can play. Take a slug of beer every time someone in the film opens or closes a door. Take another when someone puts a piece of paper in an attaché case, or picks up a phone.

Just don't drive after, or your car will look like that PBY that got caught on the runway at Hickam Field.Tora! Tora! Tora! is a Japanese-American co-production about the attack on Pearl Harbor, according to this film something of a co-production itself. The Americans were bull-headed about keeping an embargo against Japan, moving its fleet from San Diego to Hawaii in response to Japanese aggression in China. As one Japanese officer says, That fleet is a knife leveled at Japan's throat, meaning the only thing to do about it is to bomb the U.S. Navy into scrap metal by means of a surprise attack.Tora! Tora! Tora! emphasizes the courage of the Japanese forces, the idiocy of the American leaders, and the disappointment of not catching the Americans even more by surprise i.e. with their carriers in the harbor as well. Not surprisingly, the film was a big hit in one country and sank like the Arizona in the other.The film even goes out of its way to excuse the sneaky nature of the Japanese attack, suggesting a slow typist at the Japanese embassy kept the U.S. from getting a declaration of war (as Admiral Yamamoto later puts it) minutes before the attack began. In fact, the message being typed was just breaking off negotiations; Japan waited until late December before formally declaring war, as if it still needed saying. But in keeping with the script's no-fault agenda, this is obfuscated in favor of comments by Yamamoto about having awoken a sleeping giant that never in fact took place.Give the Japanese some credit They are a lot easier to watch in this movie. Both sections of the double narrative suffer from repetitive, awkward exposition scenes (No wonder you decided to call it Operation Magic! codebreaker E.G. Marshall says, with all the subtlety of Rick Moranis' Dark Helmet turning to the camera and asking Everyone got that! in Spaceballs), but at least the two Japanese directors, Kinji Fukasaku and Toshio Masuda, give you more interesting backdrops and some impressive martial pageantry to break up the tedium and help you stay interested until the fighting breaks out 90 minutes in. On the American side, Richard Fleischer shoots people walking in and out of rooms.Neville Brand and James Whitmore are the only standouts on the American side, while the Japanese cast led by Soh Yamamura (Yamamato) and Takahiro Tamura (Fushida, leader of the first assault wave) get across what little energy the film has until we get to the attacks themselves. These are impressively staged both from the air and water, and you feel a sense of helplessness and power that eyewitness accounts of the attack, however eloquent, never quite convey. It's just that it takes too long getting there. I've never before been in the position of wanting American ships to hurry up and sink; it meant the movie would be over that much faster.
