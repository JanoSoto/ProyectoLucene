[{"Title":"Schwarzenegger and De Vito (both!) steal the show in Twins.","Date":"20 March 2002","Score":"26 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Arnold is back as Julius; the result of a secret genetic experiment to help create a better human being. He has lived a sheltered life on a distant tropical island and has no real practical experience with real life issues; especially with dangerous situations involving criminal activity. He has matured into a kind of naive innocent not unlike anyone you may have found in the proverbial Garden of Eden. His desire to trace his roots leads him to the big city where he soon discovers he has a twin brother named Vincent (expertly played by Danny De Vito). Vincent was raised in an orphanage and subsequently has led a life of crime; he seems to favor car theft as his main source of income. These two soon meet and the antics from then on are nothing but hilarious. Arnold attaches himself to Danny like a puppy dog and is very determined to help and protect him. Together, they seek their birth mother as well as get into all sorts of amusing and sometimes potentially dangerous situations. But don't worry fans; with Ah-nold around what could possibly go wrong? Just remember to add this VERY funny movie to your collection of comedies on DVD and remember to pay (or avoid altogether) those parking tickets! Or get a bicycle! Or a scooter! Just don't forget the pop corn!

But his stiff delivery actually works in his favour for this film, and he makes a great double-act with Danny DeVito.Arnie plays Julius Benedict, and is the result of a top secret government experiment to create the world's most physically and mentally enhanced human being. Six men who were model citizens, like athletes and scientists were chosen to contribute a sample of genetic material. Mary-Ann Benedict was chosen to carry the baby. But instead of giving birth to one baby, she had twins.Julius was taken to a tropical island in the South Pacific where he was educated and cared for. By the time he was 35, he can speak up to twelve languages, holds degrees in biology, chemistry and physics, and is an expert in the martial arts. When he is told he has a twin brother, Vincent, he decides to leave the seclusion of the island to find him.Vincent (Danny DeVito) had a completely different upbringing than Julius. He was taken to an orphanage in Los Angeles, where he eventually ran away. By the time he was 35, he is up to his eyes in debt, loan sharks are after him, and he is now in jail.When they finally meet, they are both shocked that they look nothing alike, and are almost completely different in every way. Julius is very naive, and has a big heart. Vincent is a selfish hustler, who has as much taste for women as he does for money. Despite their differences, they try to track down their mother, and learn more about each other in the process.Arnie and DeVito have a terrific chemistry, and director Ivan Reitman made the wise choice of putting the two of them together. Its clear in their scenes together that they enjoyed working with each other. Scenes such as Julius saving Vince from a loan shark, and Vince teaching Julius how to dance are definite highlights.Reitman adds more into the film with a subplot about a stolen engine Vince wants to sell. Honestly this doesn't contribute anything to the film, and the most interesting things are Julius and Vince's exploits.Arnie manages to be convincingly awkward as he deals with the outside world for the first time. DeVito is perfectly cast too, and he shows what a great actor he is by being dramatic as well as sarcastic. Interestingly, when Reitman paired them up again in Junior, the magic wasn't the same.Although not on the same level with Reitman's Ghostbusters or Evolution, Twins is very entertaining, and is carried almost single-handed by Arnie and DeVito.

It had some really nice comedic moments with both Arnold and Danny, they were both so naturally funny and clicked so well together, you'd almost believe they were related, they were so in sync.It's about Arnold and Danny being separated at birth, it was meant for only Arnold to be born and just turn into the perfect human being, he pretty much is, he's kind, sensitive, funny, and disciplined. But there was a side effect and all the badness was born into Danny, Arnold learns he has a brother and flies to New York to see him. Arnold is more obvious as the one who wants a family while Danny is just trying to get his way out of debt with the Mafia.Twins is a fun little comedy that I think anyone could enjoy.

They took the sperm of six of the world's most accomplished atheletes and scientists, mixed them together and impregnated a woman, Mary Ann Benedict. Soon her sons were born. They were supposed to be identical twins, but unfortunately when the embryos split up, they did not come out equal. The first born son, Julius, was taken away by Werner and raised on a tropical island.He grew up into a gentle, muscular giant. He led the good life, while he twin, Vincent, was abandoned and taken to an orphanage. He led the bad life. He became a bad gambler, a womanizer, and was always up to his butt in debts. He was always under the impression that his mother had abandoned him, which just wasn't true. All their lives, Julius and Vincent had no idea they were twin brothers, but when Werner spelled it out for Julius, he headed to the USA to find Vincent. He arrived in Los Angeles and began his search, while Vincent stole a BMW and sold it to a chop shop guy. The Klane brothers (loan sharks) also hastled him on a daily basis.         Soon Vincent lands in jail due to he had over 200 unpaid parking tickets. Julius comes to visit him. He tells Vincent everything and he totally doesn't believe him. He convinces Julius to bail him out then he abandons him. However because he was his twin, Julius follows Vincent and saves him from the brutal Klanes. Vincent then heads to boost a Catillac, but unbeknownst to him, two guys had planted the Catillac there because they intended another man, Webster, to boost it. Vincent got there first and drove off. Unbeknownst to him, a very top secret device was in the trunk; Vincent and Julius stop at the super market where they run into Vincent's girlfriends, Marnie and Linda. Linda takes a shine to Julius; Julius wants to find their mother, but Vincent declines. So the next day while Julius runs into one of his fathers, Vincent discovers the plot surrounding the car and the device in the trunk. The device was for Beetroot McKinley in Houston, Texas. Beetroot tells Vincent he'll pay him $5,000,000 to deliver it to him. Vincent, speechless, jumps in the Catillac but is immediately stopped by Julius, Marnie and Linda who wanted to come along, so the four hit the road. Julius wanted to stop in New Mexico first to further trace their back history.       Julius and Vincent learn more about their mother and Julius get's his first love making experience with Linda. Soon they gang arrives in Houston where they first start looking for Mary Ann, only they learn she had died. They left feeling distraught but unbeknownst to them, the woman who told them was in fact Mary Ann. At one point, Vincent is so over come that he jumps in the car and abandons Julius, Marnie and Linda and delivers the device to Beetroot, who is soon killed by Webster. He then tries to kill Vincent, but it's Julius to the rescue. Vincent pulls a lever and a mile long chain begins dumping on Webster, marking the end of him. Well, Julius and Vincent go into business together and eventually meet their mother and all turns out alright.        Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are good together. Also in the cast are Kelly Preston and the late Trey Wilson, whom we all know as Nathan Arizona from Raising Arizona. Schwarzenegger and DeVito starred together in another film, Junior, which was also directed by Ivan Reitman. I don't think it's a sequel to Twins, but then I haven't seen it. I plan to soon. But anyway, if you're a fan of Arnold or Danny or both, then I recommend Twins! It's double fun!

The idea is simply terrific and works extremely well. A smart handsome athletic man is the twin of a short dumb criminal, comedy conventions all over and will guarantee to leave you chuckle all the way through.The story is very simplistic and easy to understand. As well as being categorised in the comedy genre there are many emotional ideologies contained within the hit film. There are many family issues raised by the characters and love is a central theme in this relaxed plot.The whole film is about the brothers and how they get along. De Vito plays the sluggish criminal Vincent who finds it difficult to accept his brother and Arnie plays the very enthusiastic brother Julius who is always willing to do everything he can. Having two different types of characters allows the tension and excitement of the film to boil up and engages the audience into watching the humour but also the emotional ideas contained. It is very heart warming and will bring a smile to your face as some actions are completely ridiculous in a humorous sense but the ending is also very special for many people. There are many 'brother' conventions. De Vito is willing to help his brother into the world and teach him the things he knows as is Arnie.Through the use of this partnership the plot is very consistently funny with more speaking humour than physical but some dancing scenes involving the pair towards the end are very humorously memorable.The idea of juxtaposing two completely figures in Schwarzenegger and De Vito was sheer movie genius. It conveys great humour throughout and through this bizarre partnership audiences will be able to appreciate the comical ideologies put forth but the director of 'Kindergarten Cop' and 'Junior'.De Vito completely outshines the terminator who we all know can't act but some of his scenes with Kelly Preston are very funny.Though the partnership was great it was a shame De Vito and Schwarzenegger got together again for 'Junior' which was terribly unfunny and predictable throughout and this 1988 hit completely outshines it in every aspect.The use of each character's personalities makes this film what it is and is therefore a much watch for anyone who enjoys family jokes.A very relaxed comedy with chuckle-some jokes worth watching for the whole family 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Beautiful film","Date":"16 January 2005","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" This was a great film. The story is of a man (Julius Benedict, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) who grows up on a tropical island with a scientist, and knows nothing of modern society. Then one day he finds out he has a twin brother in L.A. He was also told that his mother died giving birth to him and his brother. When he gets to L.A. he finds his brother, who appears to be nothing like him, sort of an opposite person entirely, although they share some things in common. Julius is very pleasant, sensible, intelligent, Vincent, his brother, is a petty car thief and always getting into trouble. Julius goes looking for where their mother lived and finds she is gone. He finds one of his 6 fathers, but not his mother. He is given an address in New Mexico to find a scientist who was at his birth. (Julius was part of a secret govt experiment to produce a superhuman man). He goes with his brother Vincent to find the scientist, who tells them their mother is alive and well and living near Santa Fe. So they go off looking for her, find her but don't realise it, as she thinks they are tricking her. She was lied to as well, being told that her son was dead, and nothing about the twin son who was born 1 minute later.Add to that some villains chasing the brothers as Vincent is driving a stolen car with a secret jet engine stored in the back, and some comedy along the way, and some magnificent scenery along the way.I thought the relationship between the two twins was great, very well done, and believable. What they said about being a family was very moving. And at the end it all works out well.An excellent film about relationships, family, and what is important in life, and about how to do the right thing, when at the end the twins do the right thing and get rewarded.I recommend this film. If you view it as a violent movie about beating the criminals, it can work on that level, if you view it as a comedy it is quite good too, but as a film about family and relationships is where it really works best, view this with an open heart.

Ivan Reitman is masterful at bringing humor into this film without it becoming silly; along with providing an edgy under-toe throughout the film. For all those who complain Arnold can't act, they need to watch this film. While I'm not a huge fan of De Vito, he provides a cynical realism to the film along with some of the more humorous moments.Re-united after several decades of separation, twins Julius (Schwarzenegger) and Vincent (De Vito) Benedict set out to find the woman who was the mother in the lab experiment that created them...and unbeknownst to Julius, Vincent wants to deliver a stolen engine to a buyer in Texas....an engine that a ruthless hit man is looking to get back by any means necessary. While Schwarzenegger and De Vito were pretty funny (above average for Schwarzenegger and classic De Vito), the hit man was my favorite. He was not your stereotypical bad guy at the time and Marshall Bell brought out the geek in him. Sadly it's something many media have now tried to create a stereotype of... all attempts have failed.Overall rating 8 out of 10.

Julius is the intelligent and athletic twin, a product of a scientific experiment, while Vincent turned out to be a forgotten, short low-life, who is on the run from loan sharks.Schwarzenegger and DeVito were funny as the the mismatched brothers, great in chemistry and is sure to send some laughs your way. Schwarzenegger sheds his tough-guy image you used to seeing in his action movies, since he wants to be sensitive to the plight in wanting to reunite with his brother and ultimately find their birth mother. But, you still see his strong, physical self at work as he throws a bunch of bad guys around.DeVito's characters can be excruciatingly annoying at times, but he does have some redeeming qualities in the latter half of the movie. The plot is slow at times, but does pick up steam in the second half. Acting was OK for the most part and you get some nice action-packed scenes.

I think this holds to be very true in families, even with the separated by birth dilemma. Arnold is directed well and plays the gentle giant with an intellect well because he is very smart. Note how Arnold never took the brash, arrogant, bad guy character which all muscle guys were typically cast as and stuck in this genre.

If you love Arnold Schwarzenegger and comedy then you're going to love this film a great cast, movie and director absolutely amazing a must see for the whole family. They are working on a sequel it would be good to see Arnie and Danny back together but the film will probably be a box office bomb and critics will hate it like they did with Dumb & Dumber To so i think they should stick in this one and never make a sequel.

Schwarzenegger is truly believable as the lunk-headed fish out of water who makes his way to America and discovers that his long-lost twin brother Danny DeVito is a small-time crook with plenty of trouble of his own to contend with.The film has plenty of laugh out loud moments and Schwarzenegger's goofy, idiotic charm fits well with DeVito's sharper, more cynical wit. Yes, there's some sentimentality here in the form of the search for the long-lost mother, but overall this is solid fun, especially when chronicling the twosome's constant outwitting of the various bad guys (including TOTAL RECALL's Marshall Bell) out to get them.

With an acting performance we have rarely seen before and a plot that we would never expect, the film serves to be fun and it's exactly what it does, well kind of. I felt it was a safely kind of OK film but nowhere near being good, here is why I felt that way about it all.The story is absurd but fun and although I did feel it was a bit crazy it served to be entertaining for just over an Hour and a half. It isn't that funny is fair to say and the comedy part lacks, but hey even when it is trying to be humorous, it is still fun anyways. Finally on the plot, we already gathered it is crazy, but it has heart felt moments where you actually do feel for them slightly, the ending can take that away a bit but still show's us there brotherly love.Arnold Schwarzenegger actually does this role without killing people, he does it with his massive frame, big fists and short shorts? ,yes it sounds like he has gone mad but he actually does OK here and is one of the only emotional performances Arnie has ever done. Danny DeVito is fun as his twin and is also down on his luck a lot, he plays these parts the best in my opinion and obviously the way that one twin is massive, one twin is small makes for some fun and great circumstances.Ivan Reitman at the directing helm does a good job and for such a difficult comedy to do with such absurd circumstances, he does a fine job indeed. I felt the script is the weakest part of this movie with some horrible lines that just serve to annoy the viewer rather than make them laugh, whether or not the lines are delivered right by the actors is up to you but for me it is the screenplays fault. I actually enjoyed the cinematography which although is typically 80's in it's shots, works really well and most street scenes and car scenes are done beautifully well.As I said before, the film isn't so funny and if you want big laughs then this isn't for you, it tries it's hardest at times as well but misses the overall mark of the film. I also did feel that although I said the acting was OK and Arnie's best, it still isn't that great, and even for a comedy which can sometimes escape with bad acting, the acting here is kind of emotionless and stale, AT TIMES. One more thing is the crazy idea all together which doesn't work THAT well but ah well, just have fun with it.People who enjoy good and fun movies with a little heartfelt emotion intertwined within should like this as well as those who like a movie where the actors just look like they had fun making it. Arnie fans may be left disappointed if they are expecting violence and armed gangs, he does used violence about once or twice in this but he is no Commando by any means in this film.Overall I'll give it a 6/10 because I did feel it was safely an OK- ish movie, albeit it is nowhere near being good let alone just OK but it still is entertainment and these two actors together on screen at there best and funniest. I would also say to watch it as rumours of a sequel are flying around now and again so just sit back back and enjoy the ride, even if it is a little bumpy.

This movie starts out silly and you wonder why everyone likes it and that it starts to pull on your heart strings, you laugh at the silliest things, Arnold's Julius endears himself to you in a way only great movie characters can and same with Vince. The film is one of those movies that lives and breathes the feel of the 80's generation which also leaves you feeling nostalgic and when its all said and done you feel so good and you're smiling and you had a great time. How can anyone not love this movie? It is easy to see why it did so well, why its considered a cult comedy classic and why it launched an unlikely comedic career for Schwarzenegger. Of course the film isn't brilliant...it is what it is. It is meant to be fun and sweet and funny and it nails everything that it tries to be. If you go in expecting some sort of feat of cinematic brilliance then you will be disappointed. Although ironically it is sort of brilliant in the way that it has become so timeless and is so perfectly made for its genre.I love Arnold Schwarzenegger. His action is timeless but his comedy proves how big his personality and on screen charisma is. He is adorable, endearing and very nearly brilliant as the perfect physical specimen who is as naive as they come. He almost immediately makes you love him and its truly a great performance. Danny Devito was the perfect match for him. They are twins like you would not believe...and you won't believe it. Their chemistry together is near perfect and absolutely makes this film what it is. Devito's sleazy, low life Vince wins you over with his endearing quirky personality. Kelly Preston and Chloe Webb are Vince and Julius's love interests. Both are good and serve their purpose but they really don't stand out. They are there to support Devito and Schwarzenegger and they do exactly that. The rest of the cast are basically mobsters and villains to support the story. They are good but again you won't really see any stand out performances. But it doesn't matter because this film lives and breathes the twins and they are absolutely perfect!! Ivan Reitman is a legendary director in many respects. He has helmed many of the great cult comedy classics especially in the eighties. He just as this incredible knack for capturing the feel of the audience of that time period. You watch his films and they are everything that the eighties stood for. Twins has everything..action, comedy, heart...and I will even admit that I just about almost teared up at the end of the film. That is impressive for a comedy to make you feel so attached to characters that are zany and ridiculous. The entire concept of the movie is so outrageous (like a few of Reitman's pictures) but you never doubt it for a single minute. You are caught up in the story and you're having a great time!! This one is going in my permanent watch again and again rotation because it is just fun. If you want a throwback comedy or are in an eighties sort of mood...this one is an absolute must!!

Strange, then, that I've always enjoyed him far more when he gets himself into the light comedy genre. Twins (in which he co-stars with Danny Devito) is certainly one of those light comedies, and as usual Arnold does well with it. It is light. The story is rather silly - which it's intended to be, so that's not a criticism. Schwarzenegger and DeVito play the Benedict twins (Julius and Vincent respectively.) Julius was the result of a scientific experiment to create the perfect human being. The experiment worked well on Julius. He's peaceful, centred, and very spiritual in a way. Nothing much bothers him. He's been raised on a deserted island with the scientists who ran the experiment - told that his mother had died giving birth to him, and not told a very big piece of information. After he was born, his mother had given birth to a second child who had been immediately put in an orphanage in Los Angeles. Fascinated by the thought of having a twin brother, Julius (with no experience of the real world) sets out to find him and to bring his family together.Schwarzenegger was great in the role. He played the part of the naive, innocent Julius discovering the world for the first time perfectly, and he's quite funny at times. Some of the fun in the movie, of course, simply comes from the contrast between the twins - the big muscular Julius, and the short, fat Vincent. These guys are twins? Vincent got the raw end of the experiment. If Julius turned out perfect, Vincent is a guy with a questionable past - a guy owing big money to loan sharks who steals cars. At first, he doesn't quite believe Julius is his brother, but he's willing to take advantage of the situation, so big Julius becomes in effect his bodyguard. (If you mess with me, you mess with my whole family he says to one of the loan shark's collectors after Julius has knocked him senseless, as he defends his beloved brother.) But the relationship grows, especially as the two start to seek out the mother they believe is still alive.Supported by Chloe Webb (as Vincent's girlfriend) and Kelly Preston (as her sister who falls for Julius) this is a pretty funny movie and a fun movie to watch. Adding unnecessary romances to a movie usually doesn't do much for me, but in this case the growing relationship between Julius and Marnie (Preston) highlighted the innocence of Julius, as he has no sense of how to make this relationship work. The movie chooses, unfortunately, to end on a rather silly note. Yeah, it was a silly movie, but (without giving it away) I didn't think the ending added anything to the story. Still, though, it's a good movie, and another of Schwarzenegger's very enjoyable comedic romps.

He later finds out that he had a twin brother and goes off to search for him. They meet and of course DeVito's character does not believe him, but through the course of the movie they get to know each other and all that sentimental stuff. Granted, DeVito's character is a bit rougher around the edges and remained a bit that way even at the end of the film. This movie is a comedy by Arnold and does not contain all that much action in it, but it still has its moments of action as they must evade a super hit-man and some guys trying to claim some money from DeVito's character.

The requisite gang of thugs is in hot pursuit.Schwarzenegger does his best as a comic naif, but it's chiefly because we've seen him in so many grim action vehicle that his innocence and optimism seems charming. Being a scalawag comes naturally to DeVito and he's fine in the role. The two girls are dispensable except that the stunning playmate Arnold picks up along the way is Kelly Preston, who is given to the stylish and sexy hair styles that Queen Noor of Jordan once favored.It's effectively directed by Ivan Reitman and the locations are colorful. Some incidents are more amusing than others, but none flub it entirely and the kids ought to enjoy it as well as mild-mannered adults -- unless the kids start asking those adults, How do you make twins? There are scenes of sentiment and shallow sorrow that will engage all eight-year-old girls who are watching.

Arnold and Devito make a great on screen pair, and the movie makes good use of the obvious physical differences comedically I think.I always remember Twins as the first movie that displayed the softer side of Arnold. To the date, his movies were mostly action flicks of the sci-fi, fantasy, and crime ilk. Twins would be the first of three Reitman comedies that Arnold would star in showing a kinder, gentler, and funnier side that I think worked well. Devito was a great support beam for this new experiment, and the two created some memorable moments together.The premise isn't as far fetched as it might seem on the surface. Arnold is artificially created in a lab using the DNA of several men who excel in different fields. This DNA is used to artificially inseminate a volunteer woman. The idea is to create a perfect man and it works splendidly for Julius (Arnold). Unfortuanely, the unexpected twin brother, Vincent (Devito), is born soon after with none of the genes of his multiple fathers, as they were all used up on Arnold.The two are separated at birth from each other and their mother, who was told that they both died during labor.

The movie is basically about Arnold looking up his roots while Devito is trying to deliver an object worth five million dollars. There are many funny scenes and some action to boot.

I don't think I'd ever actually seen Twins properly until recently and when I did see it, I still felt a certain wave of recognition; a certain emotion when everything was said and done and the closing shot faded out to the credits. Twins is a film that evokes a certain fondness from its viewer but it doesn't do so in a manipulative way; consequently Twins does it in a way that probably won't make you shed tears but won't have you labelling it 'cheesy' or anti-climatic and this is clever film-making proving that it has aged well.I was surprised at how much I could read into Twins. It's true to say that the film allows the narrative to take over once everyone gets going and sorts themselves out since it takes on a road trip approach &#150; from this point on. However, leading up to this point Twins manages to combine humour with deadpan humour; violence with censored violence; family values with self values and manages to integrate Western philosophy and ideals into its aesthetic. The idea is one that although holey, remains interesting and seemingly original Julius Benedict (Schwarzenegger) has been living on an island away from civilisation; kept adrift from any sort of values be it Western or otherwise which is why his introduction to American life is so clever. Julius discovers he has a twin brother in America and so sets off (in a rowing boat at first) to find him. I find it smart and somewhat political that Julius has been kept away from any sort of 'life' and is a better product of his society than any country in the world could ever teach him to be. America in this film is portrayed as a somewhat lowly and nasty country full of liars; criminals; antagonistic people and apparent mad-scientists who like to experiment with human milkshakes. Julius comes to America strong, well educated, well built and seemingly naïve hence when we see a montage of him in the U.S. for the first time; it's as if a child in an adult's body has been let loose on the streets.Julius' introduction into Western society is just as humorous as it is fascinating to read into. He sees and experiences things he has never come across before; a real fish-out-of-water. The film's montage deals with America's love of food as Julius eats pizza slices and hotdogs, even sharing one time with a tramp which also highlights the homeless problem America may have been experiencing back then. He gets an introduction to clothes, technology, fast food, Western iconography when he compares muscle sizes with Sylvester Stallone a dominant hard bodied piece of American iconography given the time this film was made 1988 and during the Cold War when Ronald Reagan was in power. He's also given harsh introductions to violence and sex; these two occurring in the same scene one after each other. After a brief discussion with a guy over some mannequins advertising lingerie; an attempted mugging occurs but unwillingly and somewhat naively; he is up to the task of dealing with it. His second 'introduction' to sex in the Western world comes in the form of looking at a magazine; a few seconds later he bumps into Marnie Mason (Preston) in a one in a million chance encounter it's no coincidence that this is the girl he will fall for and vice-versa and it's no coincidence that he was looking at a Playboy literally seconds before their meeting.But Schwarzenegger isn't the only star in this film. Danny de Vito plays Vincent Benedict in arguably and unfortunately; his best role behind The Penguin in Batman Returns, four years later. De Vito is quite the opposite in fact he's the binary opposite of Julius short, cocky, confident and a bit of a criminal; all of which are set up through a series of funny set pieces. But that's the joke two people who are the exact opposites of one another in terms of physical appearance and yet are twins. Director Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame reminds us that these people are related by having Schwarzenegger and De Vito play out scenes during which they mimic each others activity simultaneously; resembling perhaps a Marx brothers film or otherwise &#150; I wonder how much funnier the takes that didn't work turned out.Twins is a film that knows its place in the pyramid and never dares to be anything bigger or smarter than what it actually is; entertainment. Both brothers' adventures and mishaps leading up to the point it becomes a road picture are played out in an entertaining manner even if I found De Vito's 'wrong place, wrong time' route funnier since it involved incorrect identity and had that criminal element whilst Schwarzenegger's was mostly him attempting to find who his family is which in itself was very heart-warming. Twins is a film that hasn't dated as far as entertainment goes and although it makes couple of clumsy mistakes towards the end regarding getting everyone in one place at one time to do battle with the antagonist, Twins will suffice as a piece of clean yet emotionally effective entertainment.

The sight gag never fails to please, the character similarities and contrasts work very well, the brothers' quest is an adequate plot, the female leads both work well (and Kelly Preston is always sufficient to bring a dead man back to life), and DeVito's character has a nice development arc, as they say ultimately, the story is about Julius redeeming Vincent.The sentiment feels real and is never overdone.Oh yes, and it's funny, too.

(spoilers)","Date":"26 February 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" One of the strangest things in the world is watching Arnold Schwarzenegger, Der Gropenfuhrer himself, play a meek, sensitive, mild-mannered virgin. It's somehow not quite of this Earth. It's kind of the equivalent of watching Cliff Richard play Gene Simmons in a no holds barred biopic, one where we get to see the Peter Pan of pop service more than four thousand women with his piously pure pecker. It just doesn't seem right.But despite the knowledge that we now have about The Governator &#150; that he's a serial groper as well as a purveyor of sweaty sausage fests &#150; he's pretty good in Twins. He's got the big muscles, the dopey grin and, of course, he's got the comedy accent &#150; listening to him sing is a joy in itself (is it too late for an album? He could be the new David Hasselhoff. You ain't gonna rack and roll no more). Plus he doesn't take himself too seriously, which helps.And how can you not enjoy a film where Arnie is declared to be a physically, mentally and spiritually advanced human being? The whole idea is so ludicrous (much more so than him being Danny DeVito's twin brother) that you can't help but go with it. And like I said before, Arnie is well aware of how silly the film is and he plays up to it well.My favourite Arnie bit has to be the scene where some bloke on a motorcycle tries to mug him. The man tries to grab his briefcase but Arnie keeps a hold of it and the bloke crashes to the floor. I did nothing. The pavement was his enemy. Magnificent! And almost as good is Arnie's post-coital face after Mrs Travolta has nailed him. He looks like a man who stared too long into the abyss. And how could I forget his speech about logic? You have no respect for logic. And I have no respect for those who have no respect for logic. You're a very stupid person. And of course after this he hurls a huge man into an elevator &#150; a juxtaposition the likes of which we've never seen before or since.But as much as I love Arnie in Twins, he's not the best thing about the film. And that distinction doesn't go to Danny DeVito either. No, the best thing about the film is Marshall Bell as Webster. I love this guy. I want him to get his own franchise (or at least his own sitcom). I mean, I know Danny DeVito kills him at the end, but since when have such technicalities prevented a piece of creative genius? I can just see it now I'm Webster, the hilarious exploits of a happy go lucky, batshit crazy hit-man. I'm telling you, it would be a huge success.But of all of Webster's great moments, his introduction is the best. I'm Webster! Just two little words but two words said in such a manic, unhinged, bonkers sort of way that I'm rendered helpless with laughter. And I love how freely he uses his silenced handgun. He kills two office-bound knobs and then he kneecaps the useless Klane brothers. Webster, you sir are an American hero.But enough of the Webster love; Danny DeVito deserves some praise too. He has many great moments (using handicapped children as a means of manipulation, the look of disgust on his face when he discovers that Arnie is a virgin and all the poontang he gets &#150; he may be meagre of stature, but he's doing something right) but there's a little throwaway moment that I like more. It's the bit where he comes out of a clothes store holding a cardboard box. Just don't say they're cheap, these are quality socks! There really isn't enough sock comedy. And then the conversation he gets into with the policeman is priceless too You're parked in a handicapped zone. Do I look normal to you? And on top of the comedy, how can you remain stony-faced when Danny is told he's a piece of crap, that he's genetic garbage? And then when Arnie says that they can be family. You wont be alone anymore. We can be a family. I don't know about you, but I'd be proud to be related to Der Gropenfuhrer. Hugs all round! But of course, towards the end, the film does veer from the realms of tolerable sap to sickly schmaltz. Momma! But at least after years of dumbly assuming that the end was a mistake, I've finally realised that the five million dollars that became four wasn't some horrible continuity mistake but an acknowledgment of the fact that the brother's skimmed a million off the top of the money they returned. I always thought they were stupid, but it seems like I was the fool. Oh well, at least I've got my quality socks to cry into as I contemplate the years I wasted trying to figure out why the filmmakers overlooked such an important detail.

Getting a younger, and more widespread audience here would ensure that more people would come to love Srnie, and he would be the greatest movie star ever.Arnie plays Julian, a twin separated at birth from his brother and mother in a dubious experiment. Once he reaches a certain age he decides to go in search of his lost brother and mother, but he is not an ordinary guy. He is a genius, a muscular giant with great fighting ability, and is naive and innocent when it comes to women, the outside world, and crime as he was brought up in a tropical paradise. His search takes him to America and to a big city. Eventually he finds his brother Vincent, who was the 'failed' half of the experiment. He is small, weak, and a small time crook and womaniser, but street-smart. Vincent is going to be killed by loan sharks unless he can come up with some money fast, but when Julian interrupts, beating up the bad guys, Vincent thinks he can use Julian as protection, even though he does not believe they are brothers. However, they search for their mother anyway, as Vincent is making one last deal to save himself. They grow to like each other, and Arnie falls for Marnie, the sister of Vincent's girl. The mob are on their backs, and Julian will not stop till he finds his mum.The film works because the chemistry between Devito and Arnie is perfect. The script is also very sharp, with plenty of jokes, room for action, and with a charming quality too. The cast is good, and all seem to have a great time making it. Arnie's one-liners are present-'The pavement was your enemy' and 'You forgot the third rule in a crisis situation', but the rest of the humour is good too. The way the twins are so different, yet act the same, doing the same things at the same time etc. Arnie's singing on the plane is great too.

Most of the humor is derived from aforementioned qualities, as well as the naiveté of the former. Like other 80's comedies, such as the Look Who's Talking series, this isn't entirely clean, or OK for children to watch. While the sexuality is toned down to the point where someone who doesn't know what it is won't actually realize it, they're still beyond what a number of parents would consider OK to show their off-spring. The comedy never gets to be childish, in spite of silliness and one or two downright *painful* punchlines. The two stars do well, and when Scwarzenegger gets to let loose the muscle, it tends to be entertaining. Danny is genuinely funny when at his best in this. This movie seems quite happy to provide eye-candy for both genders. The pacing is usually good.

If you think the casting of Schwarzenegger and DeVito is amusing as a little and large combo then you'll probably like this.  If you think it dumb then you may not appreciate this.

The plot is largely meaningless &#150; a mix of the two taking a secret engine across country while looking for their mother.It really is all incident as it is only used for tonnes of fish-out-of-water jokes most of which are funny if not hilarious.  Mainly it works because of the casting of the lead two.  DeVito plays the sleazy one very well but the best one is Schwarzenegger.  He isn't a great actor but he merely plays a big naïve lump of muscle.  However what he does do is allow himself to be sent up very well.  Whether it be him making little knowing jokes (`I'll be back' or comparing muscles with Stallone on his Rambo poster) or just being the straightman to DeVito's set up jokes.  Preston is pretty but quite removed from the action (with the exception of showing a REAL nice ass in the bedroom scene!) and Webb is just plain annoying for most of the film.  The only member of the cast that is of interest outside of the two leads is an early performance by David Caruso, and guess what?  He still does that cocked head, tough talking New Yorker thing that he does in every other film.Overall the plot is senseless and is really meaningless to the success of the comedy.  The jokes are nothing special but are amusing in a tried and tested way &#150; it's only when they need the plot to work that it all looks a bit flimsy.

It is a poor comedy tied together with a very poor plot. Okay, not all Reitman movies are this bad, Kindergarten Cop is quite reasonable, and funny, but Twins is not. It is a movie that consists of a poor attempt at humour based around two shallow and clichéd characters.The whole premise of this movie is that Arnold Schwartzenegger and Danny DeVito are supposed to be twins but as they look completely different, nobody believes them. This joke works, well it doesn't work. Instead it is trying to drag humour out of something that was probably funny when we first saw it, but is not funny any more.The two characters, Julius and Vincent, are supposed to be opposites, yet twins. They were both the product of a genetic experiment. Julius was raised on a desert island and is very strong and smart. He is also very naive. Vincent was raised in an orphanage and is short and not that intelligent, yet he is very street smart. Thus the movie comes down to these two solving problems, one with his strength and intelligence, while the other with his wit.This is a reasonable premise, except the movie is dragged down by the characters interacting. This is not a problem except that all of the characters are quite shallow. Marnie is basically a blonde bimbo who is attracted by Julius' strength and doesn't really seem to care about his intelligence. In fact, the whole idea of sex and love is degraded to pure lust in this film.Twins is a dull and boring movie. It does not seem to have any idea of what type of movie it is. It begins as a search for a long lost brother, then into some sort of conspiracy movie, and ending as a road movie. It is not consistent, and the final scene is just so corny.

It's a ridicules and unlikely combination, which at the same time is the very best element of the entire movie.But besides the original refreshing concept is the movie any good? I tend to say no. It is a movie that mostly relies on just its concept and not really that much on the story. The story is quite formulaic and typical '80's comedy stuff. Meaning that it also has a villainous criminal side-plot and love interest(s). Beside the two main characters, the rest of the characters are pretty shallow and uninteresting. Yet the movie manages to be entertaining and fun enough to watch thanks to just its silly concept alone.It's obvious that Schwarzenegger is no talented comedy actor. It's fun to see how he makes fun of his own image but it doesn't feel really natural. But then again, in what other movie does Schwarzenegger show he is a good actor anyway? DeVito is obviously the more talented actor of the two. He times well and he plays his character convincing. The movie also has some other good supporting actors.It's not really a movie with some great and memorable comical moments, with the exception of some fun moments with Schwarzenegger and DeVito. that are a direct result of its unlikely concept. But aside from its concept, the movie isn't really a memorable one.The movie does have a good message in it about family values and accepting each other, without ever going to over-the-top with it, or gets too overdone.

This caring voice-over contrasts so much with the sinister look of the lab, and the music gives a much sadder feel to what is already present. I think the idea of putting two physically opposite actors together and deciding to make them twins works in this film, especially considering that the plot tells us they have genetically modified origins. Julius' odd upbringing - isolated on an island - and its after-effects are obvious very early on. He asks for a manual when asked to drive a car somewhere. You get a sense that everything is so novel to Julius - even eating an ice cream (a shot which is beautifully lit). As you wouldn't, he hasn't the first clue about romance. Vincent, of course, is totally opposite, and you know this in just a few scenes. The brothers' scenes are often juxtaposed to show this. I especially like Vincent's expression in the third rule in a crisis scene.The bionic hand when Julius' briefcase is nearly stolen is inspired - he pulls up his would-be muggers on such things as wearing motorcycle helmets. The fire extinguisher scene is so wonderful in showing how shady Vincent is and how good Julius is - Julius doesn't even hate Vincent when he rejects him. In fact, even their names seem to suit the characters. The relationship between the brothers is interesting. Vincent suddenly shows a united front with Julius, strangely enough when Julius deals with someone who is hounding his brother. Although they are twins, Julius acts like a much older brother as they learn more about their past.Some of the dialogue in Twins is brilliant. Oh, I like nuked food! is such a great line from Julius, and Vincent's I liberated this from my file at the orphanage says so much about his personality in just a few words.

They were big action star rivals at the time which is why its not Arnolds character 'Julius' laughing at Stallone, its Arnold! which is why it always makes me laugh. Also when when Schwarzenegger is singing 'yakety yak' very badly is funny. Also the 'I've only been driving an hour!' line makes me chuckle simply because of the way he says it. The other jokes are a little too obvious which feels like its really meant for a younger audience.

It turns out Vincent is in some major trouble with not only a group of bookies but he's also stolen a valuable item that has a hit-man after him. TWINS is far from a perfect movie but the story idea is so charming and the two leads so good that you can easily overlook the various flaws. It goes without saying but the main draw to this film are the two lead actors who really get a chance to shine in their parts. I think it's fair to say that the story itself isn't the strongest and that the majority of the charm and laughs come from the two actors who are obviously having fun playing brothers. Both Schwarzenegger and DeVito appear to be having the time of their lives and both really turn on the charm playing such opposite characters. Who would have ever thought Schwarzenegger would have been able to play a book-smart dork? The actor is amazingly good here because he really makes you believe that he's this character and his comic timing throughout is very impressive. DeVito can play a smart aleck jerk like no other. I think what DeVito does so well here is that this character is a real jerk and someone that it would be easy to hate but the actor is just so charming in a snake way that you can't help but love him. Seeing the two actors together really makes for a good time and especially the scenes where they're bonding like the stuff in the bedroom where they're dancing together. The support cast is pretty good as well with both Kelly Preston and Chloe Webb doing fine work as the love interest and you can also spot David Caruso and Heather Graham in small roles. Character actor Marshall Bell is also quite good in the role of the bad guy. The majority of the laughs come from the differences in the twins but we do get quite a few classic gags including one where Schwarzenegger compares himself to a Stallone poster. Another classic bit happens when the two first see each other in jail. With all the charm and heart, it's easy to overlook many of the flaws including the fact that it runs on way too long and I think the bit with the Bell character could have been left out. With that said, the poster pretty much shows you what the film is all about and if you're a fan of the two stars then this is still a must see.

One day he discovers he has a twin brother who lives in America. Julius decides to go there to try to find and meet his long lost brother, from whom he was separated at birth. Turns out his brother Vincent (DeVito) is comically much smaller than him, plus very different. Initially Vincent isn't interested in his long lost brother, but when he realizes he may be able to use him to help him get out of trouble, he lets him hang around. This brings us some of the lighter moments of the movie as the big goofy Austrian tries to learn American culture. Eventually the two grow closer and start to work together. Will they find their mum? Will Vincent's troubles with some bad guys bring about his death? It's funny how in the 80's you could get away with putting a movie out like this, let alone it becoming a smash. These days producers are less shameless in how they try to see how desperate and predictable the movie going public are, generally by bringing out totally unwarranted sequels (see Legally Blonde, Miss Congeniality and the in-the-works Oceans 13). Another popular one is putting tough guys in kids movies. I'm getting pretty disillusioned with movie going these days. It started with the candy bar prices, then the ticket prices, now it's the actual movies. I think I've gone to see less than 10 in the last year, and this is from someone who loves rushing to see a long awaited movie. Nowadays I go to Star Video and hire stuff from the last 20 years I didn't get around to seeing. I put most of the blame on Meet The Parents 2 "},{"Title":"Twins","Date":"22 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" This was the first of two films that brought director Ivan Reitman (Evolution), Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito together, the second being the pretty silly Junior. Anyway, two non-identical twin babies (second not expected) were born as part of a top secret scientific experiment to create an advanced human being. Many years later after being told he had a brother, good natured, naive and intelligent Julius Benedict (Schwarzenegger) decided to travel to the city where his brother is, to find him. Vincent Benedict (DeVito) is his dim-witted, money hungry and easily-annoyed brother, and after a while Julius convinces him to let him stick by his side. Throughout the film after this they search for the mother, Mary Ann Benedict (Bonnie Bartlett), have get-together moments with their girlfriends, Marnie Mason (Kelly Preston) and Linda Mason (Chloe Webb), and go up against Beetroot McKinley (Trey Wilson) and Webster (Marshall Bell), because Vince stole a car with a priceless piece of machinery in the boot. This film does not have as many laughs as any traditional comedy, but it still works as a great sentimental family film. The song Twins (at the end) was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

Nothing special about this one. A stupid story, hiding behind Arnie's huge biceps.     4/10  "}]
