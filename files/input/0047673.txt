[{"Title":".........just like the ones we used to know.","Date":"11 August 2005","Score":"69 out of 73 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derri√®re and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.

And here's the interesting thing I don't disagree with most of the individual carps. Yes, the movie is a piece of fluff. Yes,the usually dependable Danny Kaye is a bit weak in his performance. Yes, the plot mechanism for inserting many of the production numbers is lame.  Heck, even the continuity is poor...I myself have discovered three noticeable continuity fluffs. But here's the thing.  The movie works, anyway!!! Bing and Danny nevertheless make a likeable Mutt and Jeff duo. The supporting cast all holds their own, from a radiant (and surprisingly voluptuous) Rosemary Clooney, to the astoundingly agile Vera Ellen, to Dean Jagger's Patton-like General Waverly...they all hit their marks very well. The plot-line is unbelievable.  Who cares?  This is a feel-good Christmas Movie, for cryin' out loud!  The production numbers are sheer fun, the plot doesn't get in the way of all the beauty and great music, the actors are obviously having a good time, and we're all allowed to window-peep on the shenanigans.  This is the PERFECT movie to put on after Macy's Parade, while all those who don't like football are helping prep for the big Turkey Day meal.  You sneak a bit of dressing or cranberry sauce, and watch a production number.  The plot is so user-friendly, missing five minutes here and there doesn't hurt. Treat yourself.  Discover why millions of views have made this movie a holiday favorite, despite the critics' opinions! "},{"Title":"I'm dreaming of...

Have since the first time I saw it! Sure... some may classify it as simply a feel-good movie, but what's wrong with that?  Some may also classify it as pure schmaltz, but the movie truly does have it's sad points... like the priceless look on General Waverly's face whenever he enters the room where everyone who had been under his division is awaiting his arrival!The movie has a truly wonderful musical score, not to mention some VERY kick butt dancing!Bing Crosby is charming as Bob Wallace, a calm and reserved, yet witty and delightful and wise-cracking, and somewhat cynical kind of guy. Bing truly performed to his greatest.  And his vocal talent is enormous, not to mention evident throughout the entire movie!  It's a real treat to see him crack up when he and Danny Kaye are performing their rendition of Sisters!Danny Kaye is hilarious as Phil Davis, the foil to calm and cool Bob. Phil, too, is full of wise-cracks, and very intent on getting Bob to settle down. Danny gave such a life to his character, portraying him like no other! His best one liner was when a young blonde with voice like nails on a chalk board says to him (after his phoney engagment to Judy) I sure wish it would happen to me!) to which he replies So do I!Rosemary Clooney is absolutely riveting as Betty Haynes, the older of the two Haynes sisters.  She is the most calm and most subdued.  She is looking for her knight on the white horse in life.  Rosemary played Betty to the fullest, making her every bit as believable as you could imagine!  And that voice... GOLDEN!  A gift from God!  It's a true treasure to see her in her solo Love (You Didn't Do Right By Me).  She's absolutely marvelous and extremely talented.Vera-Ellen is refreshingly delightful as Judy Haynes, the younger and more naive Haynes sister.  Judy is also the dreamer of the two.  Vera-Ellen does a wonderfully through job of portraying Judy!  She is a perfect foil to her older sister.  And those dancing stems... to see her dance in numbers like Mandy and Choreography is a real treat!  How ANYONE could ever dance as well as she is beyond me!  She really did a great job in this movie, even better than her performance in On The Town with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Betty Garrett.A GREAT MOVIE!!!!  GREAT CAST CHEMISTRY!!!!  GREAT MUSIC!!!!  GREAT DANCING!!!!  WATCH IT AND YOU WILL SOON BE DREAMING OF A WHITE CHRISTMAS!!!!

But I confess to having loved it from the first moment I saw it nearly a half century ago.  I, too, like many, make it a point to view it every Christmas season, along with much better holiday fare such as It's a Wonderful Life, The Wizard of Oz, and Miracle on 34th Street. 	I think, contrary to many folks, that Danny Kaye succeeds in the second lead role better than Fred Astaire did in Holiday Inn, and while he isn't given an opportunity for his patented zaniness, he adds a thoroughgoing charm to the role that sometimes the rather stiff Astaire lacks. 	Rosemary Clooney is lovely in the rather thankless role of the practical sister and was at the peak of her genius as a pop singer, Vera-Ellen does her usually charming thing, and Crosby!  The master implants his genius in virtually every frame.  In supporting roles veteran character actor Dean Jagger is splendid as the general, while Mary Wickes steals every scene she's in as the nosy hotel housekeeper, Emma. 	The singing and dancing are first-rate (even without Astaire), and the songs by Irving Berlin are among his very best, including a number of tunes written especially for the film.  One that never ceases to charm me is the trifle, Snow, sung by our four stars in the dining car of the railroad train bound from Florida to Vermont.  What a magical moment, among many in this thoroughly delightful, if flawed, jewel.

The plot is very thin, and seems to be written just to hold the musical numbers together, but it makes for a very enjoyable movie indeed.  Viewing this film has become a holiday tradition in my family, and it is great fun to quote memorable lines and sing along with Bing, Danny, Vera-Ellen, and of course, the incomparable Rosemary Clooney. We have a theater here in Austin that regularly shows classic films, and the year they screened White Christmas, there was a packed house, and everyone sang along with every song and yelled out lines, sort of like Rocky Horror Picture Show without the dressing up.  White Christmas is just a fun movie, and I highly recommend it for holiday viewing.

My apologies, Alistair! My all-time favorite Christmas was, is, and always will be, White Christmas. First of all, there's that wonderful Irving Berlin score. Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep and Sisters have become standards, of course. But, towering above them all, is Bing Crosby's definitive performance of the beloved Christmas favorite that he practically owned. All the performances are top-drawer, what with Bing, Danny Kaye (In a role meant for Donald O'Connor), Rosie Clooney, Vera-Ellen, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes, who, as you can see here, was playing nasty old things even when she was a nasty young thing!Corny, syrupy, kitsch. Perhaps it is all of that, to some. But, to unashamed sentimentalists like me, White Christmas will always be THE all-time great Christmas movie, particularly when viewed by the whole family, on Christmas Day, in front of the fireplace.God bless Bing, Berlin, and company, for making a lot of Holidays that much happier, including those of the Sorrentino family!

He shows a light touch that helps make this a cherished film for movie fans of all ages. Based on material by another great team, Norman Panama, Norman Krasna and Melvin Frank, the movie is light as a feather. The film is sort of a variation on the theme, let's put on a show, or even, if we stage it, they will come, we know how it will end, but we feel good, and enjoy it even though we know the plot by heart.The main reason for watching, besides Mr. Berlin's wonderful tunes, is hearing those standard songs delivered by the likes of Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, who were at the top of their careers. They had such wonderful and melodious voices, they enhance the songs they interpret. The story is just a pretext to bring together the talented principals plus Danny Kaye, Vera Ellen, Dean Jagger, and the marvelous Mary Wickes, in a film that will delight anyone, anytime, but especially at Christmas.

"},{"Title":"Slick, Schmaltzy Holiday Charmer","Date":"27 December 1999","Score":"14 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":"  A slick, schmaltzy, sort-of remake of `Holiday Inn' (1942),  `White Christmas' lacks the sass and sparkle of the earlier film.  It's also lacking Fred Astaire, though Danny Kaye is in there trying. Bing Crosby seems a tad long in the tooth for his role as a marriage-shy song and dance man, and the whole movie is permeated by the suffocating post-war insistence on everyone marrying and settling down.  This movie also falls under the `bigger, louder, better' philosophy the Hollywood film studios espoused in the early &#145;50s to combat the growing competition of television.The thin plot (old army buddies Crosby and Kaye team up with a sister act, Clooney and Vera Ellen, to save the destitute Vermont ski lodge of their former commanding general, Dean Jagger)  padded out with various romantic complications is only an excuse for the Irving Berlin numbers.  Crosby gives a nice, relaxed rendition of `Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep' and everyone comes through on the finale, a show topping performance of the title number, complete with Santa outfits and girl ballerinas.  Of the production numbers, the simplest are the more noteworthy.  Clooney and Vera-Ellen offer a straight version of `Sisters', a song that became the delight of a generation of drag queens and female impersonators.  Crosby and Kaye reprise it in makeshift drag (Kaye getting to do a bit of his manic schtick and Crosby game but clearly uncomfortable).  `Mandy', the big centerpiece of the show the gang puts on at the ski lodge (naturally it's a musical review, that hoariest of Hollywood musical cliches), is a bit of a mess.  But it comes complete with &#145;50s Rococo sets, a bevy of chorus boys in tight pants, and Vera-Ellen rising out of the floor.  And what was it with Irving Berlin and ersatz Minstrel Show nostalgia anyway?  `White Christmas' has a similar number &#150; in blackface! &#150; that was routinely excised for TV showings.  Kaye's big number, `Choreography' is a lame would-be satire on the serious `jazz ballet' then popular on Broadway and in such films as `Words and Music' (1948).  A far more deft exploration of the same idea is the `Girl Hunt' number in `The Band Wagon' (1954), starring Fred Astaire.Speaking of Astaire, compared with `Holiday Inn', the dance routines in `White Christmas' are unremarkable. Vera-Ellen does get ample opportunity to show off her lithe physique and slim waist, and her waltz with Kaye to `The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing' is nicely done.   Probably the best dancing in the film is her rehearsal of the `Abraham' number with a well-built male dancer.  It has the snap and brio the other numbers just miss.Clooney's lush voice is a nice compliment to Crosby, though she is stuck with the role of the `sensible' sister (in contrast to Vera-Ellen's schemer).  Her fledgling romance with Crosby keeps getting stonewalled by misunderstandings and false information.  She does get a juicy torch song, `Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me' ,which is given a deluxe presentation with a quartette of black-clad chorus boys in a posh NY nightclub.  (One of them is George Chakiris, later to star in the 1961 film version of  `West Side Story'.)Production wise, the film is colorful and lavish, with sets ranging from a very artificial looking WW II battlefield to an expansive, al fresco Florida nightspot adorned with a gigantic aquarium.    Amusingly, the Vermont inn's architecture seems inspired by the Connecticut country retreat of `Holiday Inn', with some pseudo Swiss touches thrown in.  The general's housekeeper (reliable screen veteran Mary Wickes) aptly describes the d√©cor as a `Tyrolean haunted house'.  Edith Head's costumes run the gamut of &#145;50s fashions for the ladies, from tailored suits through full-skirted `New  Look' dresses to sleek, form-fitting evening gowns with huge flared hems.    This was the first feature released in the wide screen Vistavision process, and the film makes good use of the space in its compositions.  The highlight is the scene when Crosby and Kaye first realize that the long awaited snow has arrived in Vermont, in time to save the general's investment in his ski lodge.  They throw open the barn doors at the rear of the stage, revealing a wintry landscape with a horse-drawn sleigh just coming into view.  It's a lovely shot, charmingly artificial, and a good summation of the cheerful, escapist mood of this film.

This film is so harmless and revered that it can't really be seriously judged against usual criteria.  It is a fun and cute musical comedy, and it is really corny unrealistic but then again so were most musicals in the 1950's.  Add a heavy dose of Christmas cheer and you have what is probably one of the most loved Christmas movies of all time.  One thing I can commend it for is that although it is essentially a remake of `Holiday Inn', they blessedly didn't stoop to the god-awful level of the `Abraham' number at any time during the film.  I also cannot help but laugh every time I see Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye's rendition of Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen's `Sisters' act.Sure it's corny and saccharine, and yes it has some really mediocre musical and dance numbers, but White Christmas does indeed succeed at what it seemingly sets out to do  Instill nostalgia for care-free times and engage even a little bit of the `Christmas Spirit' in most viewers.

Flash forward a few years and the two soldiers (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye) are now successful Broadway entertainers. They fall for a nightclub sister-act (Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen) and the foursome spend Christmas in Vermont at an inn that just happens to be owned by their beloved old colonel (Dean Jagger) who's down on his luck.This wonderful musical is my favorite Christmas movie; it's sentimental and sweet and has four hugely talented stars. The Irving Berlin songs are upbeat and lovely and, of course, the classic White Christmas tugs at your heart. Bing plays the sensible, hard-working guy who funnyman Danny is always trying to marry off. Rosemary is a sensitive singer and Vera-Ellen is a dazzling dancer. They have such a good time together that viewers can't help but be carried away by the pure joy of it all.This movie is firmly-rooted in the fifties, purely G-rated and many call it corny, but I love this kind of movie. I can't count the number of times I've seen and yet it's never gotten old for me. The actors are beautiful, the romance is innocent, and the happy-ever-after finale with everyone dressed in red and white amid gently falling snow is unforgettable. If you like movies the way they used to be made, you'll love White Christmas.

Well, me for one, so with the snow thick on the ground for the first Scottish white Christmas in 9 years, what better time to break my duck...Personally I'd have preferred to have seen its predecessor Holiday Inn with an in-his-prime Fred Astaire in the Danny Kaye part, but that will have to wait for another year. Besides I like Kaye and while he gets a few dances alongside Vera Ellen and her impossibly thin legs, he's principally there, of course as a less sour Bob Hope to old Bing's holier-than-thou straight man.The story is of course hokum on a stick but I'll temper any cynicism with the thought of the relevance of the tie-in of Christmas to soldiers to the US cinema-going public of the time, not only so soon after the end of the Second World War, but with the then current war in Korea under way (isn't that always the way with wars, they just keep on coming).The four stars all act engagingly, with good support too from Dean Jagger as the revered major-general and Mary Wickes as his owlish receptionist, although I would carp that some of the song and dance routines are fairly unexciting, the movie does look awfully set-bound and it was a shame to see some fairly obvious lip-sync-hing on the big numbers. I also didn't understand why in the resolution of the misunderstanding of Crosby's motives in staging the big holiday pageant at their old commander's financially ailing resort, the director missed the chance to show the dawning of the truth on mistaken messenger, Wickes, but by the time they open up the gates to let in the snow and the familiar strains of THAT song by the conclusion, there isn't a dry eye in the house.Irving Berlin's soundtrack is as ever, tuneful and pleasing, with the wit of the lyrics of his army songs, in particular, highlighting an underrated part of his talent. The photography is beautifully colourful and old maestro Micahael Curtiz unobtrusively and efficiently bringing this slight story to life.All in all, a pleasant release from today's wears and scares and I hope that anyone who watches it in the future gets to do so to a snowy backdrop outside, like I did as it somehow adds to the lustre of the film.

Granted the plot, what there is of one, is rather thin, it is splashy good fun directed by the dependably versatile Michael Curtiz with several Irving Berlin standards and four superb variety performers in their prime. As much as Capra's film is an annual tradition, it is really this film that I look forward to the most of all the holiday classics.The storyline focuses on two former soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, both song-and-dance men who become best friends when Davis saves Wallace from a falling building during WWII. After years of post-war success on Broadway and the nightclub circuit, they become reconnected with their gruff but lovable former army commander, General Waverly. The general now owns a Vermont ski lodge, but he is treading water financially since there is no snow as Christmas approaches. As it turns out, the Haynes sisters, Betty and Judy, are playing the lodge during the holidays, and of course, romantic entanglements ensue all the way through the big finale when all four star in a show that they hope will save the general's lodge.All of this seems rather incidental to the musical numbers showcased in the then-revolutionary widescreen process called VistaVision. The most relaxed of actors during this era, Bing Crosby plays Wallace with his natural √©lan, and he croons the classic title tune early on and leads the group sing of the same song at the end. In contrast, Danny Kaye plays Davis with his mercurial style intact, though compared to his other films of the period, he is relatively subdued here. With her smoky, silken vocal skills on display, Rosemary Clooney plays Betty, Wallace's love interest, with aplomb and complements Crosby easily on Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep). She also delivers a nice torchy Berlin tune with Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me despite some silly man-choreography.I have to say the most impressive performer of the quartet is Vera-Ellen, a phenomenal dancer who was the equal of Astaire and Kelly at her peak. She makes even Kaye look good in their musical duets - The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing and the amusing Martha Graham riff, Choreography. However, her best numbers are with dancer John Brascia - the elaborate Mandy number where her pliable, slender frame seems to be everywhere on the screen, and the brief rehearsal number, Abraham, where she and Brascia snap, pop, clap, kick and swing with unerring military precision. It's worth noting that her singing is dubbed by vocalist Trudy Stevens, which is pointed out by Clooney on the less-than-informative audio commentary track in the DVD package. Much better is the 16-minute retrospective interview with Clooney where her natural sense of humor emerges.There are other numbers worth mentioning in the movie - the duet, Sisters, done first straight by the women and later by the men as a comedy routine in half-drag (Kaye steals this bit handily with his over-the-top clowning); the foursome on the vintage Berlin Snow and Gee, I Wish I was Back in the Army; and of course, the title tune at the end. Way over on the sidelines, Dean Jagger lends his warm dignity to the role of the retired general, and Mary Wickes plays Emma the housekeeper in her typically sarcastic manner. Special mention needs to be given to Loyal Griggs's vibrant Technicolor cinematography, which makes the entire movie look appropriately like a bright red candy box, and the print transfer in the DVD almost fully captures the original visual quality. This is undemanding entertainment and a dependable holiday classic that feels like a favorite well-worn blanket.

Sure, it's a corny flick, but it works because it touches people at an emotional level; it's easy to overlook the few noticeable gaffes. As cheesy as it is, it's perfectly easy to suspend disbelief and go with it; we get caught up in the story, and we like the people in the film.

As they sing, the camera pulls back and over the tables to show different people at each table rising to toast each other.  It is a remarkably  poignant scene for me.  Friends toasting old friends.

The songs are catchy and the dancing is good, but that does not explain the special something in this film.  For some reason, all of its elements combined make for a heartwarming, spirit-lifting experience.  Holiday Inn is often compared with it and is very similar, but I find White Christmas to be far better in music, story, acting, and, most of all, it is MUCH FUNNIER.The film's low points include the song about snow and the minstrel show, both of which are almost intolerably corny.  High points are the song about dancing and the Abraham number, which showcase Vera Ellen's dancing genius.I think the best way to view White Christmas is as a period piece.  It was made in a time when funny, light musical comedies were standard fare.  They have since fallen out of popularity, but this film is a great example of one.  If a person is picking between this and Holiday Inn, I would recommend watching White Christmas every time.  I would only recommend this movie to women.  It is not a man's movie and no man should ever be forced to put up with it.So, if you are a woman, make some cookies and cocoa when its cold outside, wrap up with a blanket, and put White Christmas in the VCR or DVD player.

There will be spoilers aheadThis musical is designed as a vehicle for the music of Irving Berlin, starring Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye as old Army buddies, with Kaye saving Crosby's life during the war. The opening musical number takes place during the war in their unit, at the company Christmas show, to celebrate their commander, who's being rotated out of command.Flash forward and the two are now prominent in show business, with a company of their own. The sisters (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) of one of the men from their unit contrive to get an audition of sorts when Vera-Ellen sends them a note telling them of their act at a club. Through a series of improbable events (the plot is like cotton candy-sweet but insubstantial) the four wind up on a train together and headed to the same inn in Vermont.The inn is owned by the former commander (played well by Dean Jagger) and the inn isn't doing well, given that there's no snow. Again, through a series of plot contrivances, a show is planned for the inn, with an invitation to the men of their old unit, at least those who can do so, to come up to Vermont to express their support for their old commander.As this is a romantic comedy, the quartet pairs off, Crosby with Clooney and Kaye with Vera-Ellen. The course isn't smooth, but true love wins out in the end. There's a Hollywood ending and all's well in the end.None of that really matters, because the chemistry between the leads is fantastic. Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen look perfect together in The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing, Crosby and Kaye work well together and Crosby and Clooney are perfect as a couple.This film is available on disc and is well worth watching.

In the mean time, they become romantically involved with a sister act, played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera Allen. There is witty comedy and old-fashion romance, provided by the four stars, and scores of toe-tapping musical and dance sequences one after the other.While this movie can be whimsical and some of the musical numbers can drag on at times, the story about the actors going through highs and lows to try to save the inn, with their romantic relationships intertwined in the process, is pretty entertaining to watch. The part where all four sing White Christmas together is my favorite scene - rich and vibrant in song helped by a children chorus, and a spectacular background containing a large Christmas tree and a beautiful snow scene.Again, I'm not a fan of musicals.

Falling in with two lovely sisters, Betty & Judy, the boys plan to put on a variety show with the girls to entice people back to the lodge. But misunderstandings and romantic leanings are not going to make this at all easy.Enduring, perennial, simple and beguiling are all words fit to be associated with White Christmas. It's directed by Mr Reliable, Michael Curtiz, features songs from Irving Berlin and stars Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen & Dean Jagger. Filmed in Technicolor, it's also notable for being the first film to be shot in VistaVision think wide-screen process. In truth the film is thinly plotted and doesn't remotely feature some of Berlin's best tunes, and I dare to be a touch more critical-the VistaVision is wasted on the studio led direction. Yet it's such a charming and heart warming film it feels churlish to let the negatives negate the overriding feeling of having been cheered after a viewing.So although it's not the brilliance it perhaps should have been, it's ultimately a picture that still reels in new viewers nearly 60 years after its release. That's something that is hard to argue with. So enjoy the title song and the likes of Sisters, The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep & Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me.

Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic.

Honestly I love the ending with the general. It really gets to me. On the other hand I loved both Crosby and Clooney's characters, but I did not buy their relationship and its development. That would be the biggest complaint, but it captures a memory that reminds of me of home more than most other movies. Honestly I really think there is a lot wrong with the movie, but it personally it creates a comfort zone for me that reminds me of what it means to be part of a family. It sounds corny, but I am sounding more corny each day. Good movie and Crosby just shines in a way that men don't shine anymore.

Do the authors realize that this movie wasn't made in the 21st century. All movies made then, particularly the musicals seems somewhat strange in today's setting. But this was a very good movie and it doesn't matter if there wasn't a lot of fake snow, or, if virtuoso acting performances weren't given by some of the greatest acts of the day.Danny Kaye is perhaps in the top ten of all time film performers and perhaps the most multi-talented man who ever graced the screen. Vera Ellen is a dancer matched only among women by Cyd Charisse. Bing Crosby, other than singing one of the greatest Xmas songs of all time (I won't say best, even if it is the best selling) was a wonderful comic actor whose work here is of the same quality as it was in the Road movies. Rosemary Clooney, perhaps the least of the entertainers, was the best actor of the bunch. But, guess what, you critical Scrooges -- the movie was about the music and the dancing, not the plot or the fake snow or the acting.I missed this point once myself watching Oh Brother! Where art thou? I told a friend the next day after I watched it that it wasn't all that funny a comedy, but, strangely, I couldn't get the music out of my head. He said, you idiot, it's all about the music. Huh? I rented it again. What a great movie once I had my head on straight.So here's your Xmas assignment.

This movie made of Irving Berlin songs both old and new, also stars Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes with some familiar bit players like Herb Vigran and Grady Sutton. Also, George Chakiris, best known as Bernardo in West Side Story, is a dancing extra here. The story of two former army buddies-turned-musical-partners who meet a two sister singing act that's on their way to a lodge owned by the general of the former army pals is just a contrivance to put together various songs to fit in certain segments. Good musical performances abound with some of my favorites being Choreography with Kaye and Vera-Ellen making fun of Jazz-Ballet and the Count Your Blessings duet with Crosby and Clooney. While I said the story is pretty contrived, I also was mostly willing to go along with most of it as the performers made it all go down easy with director Michael Curtiz lending a brisk pace throughout. The now-classic song White Christmas was probably better handled in Holiday Inn by Bing some 12 years before but still, it's a good way to both begin and end this wonderful showcase to Mr. Berlin that's become a holiday classic for the last 50 years. P.S.-The picture that Vera-Ellen show of she and Clooney's brother that served with Bing and Danny is that of former Our Ganger/Little Rascal Carl Alfalfa Switzer!

This film was shot in color & wide screen & it still looks plush & alive even now. The way to watch it is when Turner Classic films is running it in wide screen too. This film is one of the only times Danny Kaye & Bing Crosby worked together & it is a shame it did not happen more. They are delightful in this film. Rosemary Clooney & Vera Ellen are too. This Paramount production was one of the most expensive they produced the year it was released & it was also number 1 in the box office.While the story is very simplistic by today's standards & even when it was released in 1954, it doesn't matter. You put your brain away & enjoy this holiday film as a rare chance to see some veteran performers from the World War 2 era entertain you. There's lots of musical numbers & dancing from the era of the big musical. All of it is well staged, & the music is at the height previous to rock & roll era. If your into old films, go back to the mid-1940's when Bing Crosby did the song White Christmas for the first time on film in Paramounts Holiday Inn as there are a couple of comparisons to note. First, Bing sings the song solo in the first film where in this 1954 version the entire ensemble (cast) sing it together. Second, the Holiday Inn is the same set used for the Pine Tree Inn in the second film. Paramount saved some money on sets there. Funny, Crosby gets demoted too in a way. In the first film he actually owns the Holiday Inn where in this film, his former Major-general owns it. The scripts between the 2 are quite different too. Fred Astaire is in the first one in 1942 too. In a way, some folks consider this an inferior remake to Holiday Inn, but to me there are vast differences in the films. White Christmas fits the era it was made, as 1954 was a feel good era where every problem was always being solved. An interesting thing about this film, it incorporates the power of the television media into the plot already in 1954. Most folks then did not realize how far that power would grow into todays national fixation where if something is on TV, too often people believe it as true. Back in 1954, people were still intelligent enough to know when something was not true on its media. That is why you don't care about a strong story line in this film. Everything is fake, but back then fake was fine with people, as long as it was harmless & entertaining.

I happen to like the film, Holiday Inn, very much, and I like this film as well. But,the characters are different, the plot is different, and so are most of the songs.Both films are holiday classics. Each film can be judged on its own merits.There is one additional comment I'd like to make. Irving Berlin was a shrewd businessman as well as a great composer. For various movie studios, he'd pitch ideas for films (using his music of course and getting film credit above the title), and then not only write new material but revive some of his old songs. This was a very smart way of making money by re-popularizing mostly forgotten songs. By the way, the composer makes money every time his song is played on radio or TV.Not only is White Christmas an example, but also Alexander's Ragtime Band, Blue Skies, Easter Parade, and There's No Business Like Show Business.

It was the scene where Rosemary Clooney has been misinformed about what Bing is going to do to promote the show and she slams a chair on the stage and walks off. This was at a time when new Wide-Screen Movies were going a-muck and this was the first movie presented in Vista-Vision one of the many to come our way such as Cinamascope, Super-Scope, Cinerama, and Todd-A-O just to mention a few. So, we know the movie and how entertaining it is, but there is a little history behind it and one of it's stars.Rosemary Cloony, born and raised in Maysville, Kentucky, started singing here in Cincinnati, Ohio with her sister Betty on W.L.W. Radio, and then eventually Rosemary went to New York City and then eventually to Hollywood where she made a few films, but White Christmas was to be her most well known and successful film of her career. I remember when Rosemary made her debut in the movies in The Stars Are Singing and we were having exams in High School, so after the exams a friend of mine and I went to the Albee Theater and saw her walk in through the Vine Street Stage Door to the theater. Then between showings she got on the stage, sang some songs and talked about how it was so amazing to see herself on that big movie screen. So, years later, Rosemary's brother Nick would be our news anchor at W.K.R.C. television and then his son George Clooney, Rosemarys nephew, would make his mark in Hollywood as an excellent actor. Wonder where he got the talent from? So, Rosemary was on Tom Snyders Show on T.V. and he said, I guess you're very proud of George, aren't you? And she answered, Oh, yes! But when he first came to Hollywood, all he wanted to do was sit on my couch, watch T.V., and drink beer. So, I had to kick his ass out of the house tell him to get a job! So, back to White Christmas One thing that people don't know is that Donald O'Connor was originally scheduled to play the Danny Kaye part but couldn't so he eventually played with Bing Crosby in the remake of Anything Goes, and since Vera Ellen never really had a good singing voice, her voice double was usually Anita Ellis and for Call Me Madam, Carole Richards, who dubbed mostly for Cyd Charisse, but for White Christmas, when Vera Ellen is singing, that's really Rosemary's sister Betty Clooney dubbing for Vera Ellen's singing voice. By the way, Vera Ellen was born and raised in a section of Cincinnati, Ohio called Norwood! We can count our blessings that we have such wonderful entertainers from this city, including Doris Day, George Chakiris, Tyrone Power, and there's a rumor that Roy Rogers was born on the waterfront, and of course, the Looney Clooney's including George!

It is also something suitable for young children, as it it creative and sentimental, without being completely saccharine-sweet.Rosemary Clooney is excellent when she sings Love, you didn't do right by me; the staging is very 50's, and kitschy.

Others have described the story and script as a straight-forward happy experience, and it is just that. It could've been conceived any time of the year, but as it is, the story bookends two Christmases over the span of ten years. After it settles into the current year of the film, it ends with a luminous Christmas Eve snowfall. Simple, uncluttered magic. The film *is* sentimental and a bit schmaltzy, and that doesn't hurt it one iota. And while Bing Crosby is the star of this one as well as 'Holiday Inn,' I don't entirely buy that this is a remake of that. (No other holidays are mentioned in this film.) But it does have the late Rosemary Clooney (a siren of beauty *and* song) playing nicely off Crosby, especially in the duet Count Your Blessings, as well as comic genius Danny Kaye- who is especially fine in the satirical Choreography and his glamorous, Astaire-like dance with Vera-Ellen to The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing. The film's one sour note is in its leaden third act. It rolls along at a marvelous light-hearted pace for roughly 70 minutes, the principals all approaching their material with an ever-so-sly wink to the audience and each other. (Snow is especially lovely, with the group's 4-part harmony on the train tempered by their deadpan comedy at the less-than-climactic revelation of the 68-degree 'winter playground.') Then a sickeningly small misunderstanding- which could've been resolved in 5 minutes instead of the final third of the movie- slows everything down. But that's nitpicking. Few things on earth can match the joy of a tapping Vera-Ellen or the pair of Crosby and Kaye on the brink of giggles as they lip-sync Sisters in their rhinestones and feather boas. Would've liked more singing by the gorgeous Clooney, and more than one dance with Kaye and Ellen (but I understand that to be a compromise from the producers, who originally planned for Fred Astaire- and then Donald O'Connor- to be in Kaye's role).

So what is it about White Christmas that gets our hearts pitty pattering for the Christmas season to unravel itself? Besides the fact that it has a wonderful score, wonderful actors/actresses/dancers etc, and positive message, it's hard to understand how anyone could dislike a movie such as this.Though White Christmas is in fact one of my favorite Holiday movies, I have heard others say they didn't like it on grounds of it not being a Christmas movie, or that it has no Christmas worthy message. To all this I beg to differ. White Christmas has more to do with Christmas or the holidays than one would think. I mean, what really is the true meaning of Christmas anyways? Besides being a Christian holiday, it's also the season of giving. For doing things for one another for the sake of humanity, and that's exactly what this movie portrays.Alright so the real only Christmas thing about the movie is the beginning and the end, but think of the basic principle that serves as a catalyst up to the final tear jerking moment of the film.So let's rewind. Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) are two soldiers serving under General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger) who is retiring from the army near the end of WW2. Under lucky circumstances Phil saves Bob's life during an unexpected air-raid leaving Bob obliged to make it up to Phil, who's one kooky idea is to team up with Bob in show business. The result being that they both become the infamous Wallace and Davis stage act.Along the way they meet The Hayne Sisters, who are the sisters of a fellow army buddy of theirs, and also just making a name for themselves as a performing sister act too. Phil wants Bob to settle down, so he tries to pair up Betty (Rosemary Clooney)and Bob, whom are both head strong, responsible and stubborn, while he finds himself getting whisked away by Judy (Vera-Ellen) Betty's younger, more impulsive sister.All of this happens within the first 45 minutes of this movie, but the story really doesnt go into effect until they all four decide to go to Vermont together where the Hayne sisters are to perform at an Inn that is in fear of going out of business. Ironically enough the Inn belongs to General Waiverly, who was Wallace and Davis's role model and mentor during WW2. From that moment on Phil and Bob decide to put their fame to good use, and help the ol' General out by sending for their stage show and crew, to use the inn as a rehearsal center. They rebuild the place, build a killer stage with an ochestra, throw the Hayne Sisters into their act, and bring on a ton of publicity for the General's Inn. See...the big reason the Inn is going under is because the unseasonably warm weather is keeping the snow away, and that's where the money is supossedly. Everything seems to be going rosey, or so everyone thinks, until the General, who's getting anxious again decides to go back into the army, only to be turned down because of his age. Or so the movie lets on to believe.Danny and Bing decide to give a pitch on television to all the men who served under the General during the war in hopes that they would come out to Vermont on Christmas Eve to pay their respects to the General to let him know how much he meant to them.And as the finale of the movie appears up on screen, those last tearjerking 10 minutes. You see the General get the best gift he ever could get.Of course there are moments that are so cheesy that they ooze velveeta all over the place, but all in all it does show you what this movie is about. The rewards for doing things for other, and giving them experiences that they will never forget.I guess I enjoy this movie so much because it comes from a time when things were simpler. Both of my Grandmother's love Bing Crosby so it's nice to sit down and watch a movie that isn't coated in sex and scandals or violence. Where real entertainment was with music and singing and dancing. The music, and colors, and morals portrayed are a kind of dying art. And regardless of whether this movie IS as Christmasy people want it or dont want it to be, it should just be watched as a whole. A simply wonderful film.

I really liked Holiday Inn as well, but I like Danny so much better than Fred Astair (if we're comparing the films and their very loosely similar stories).  I liked Rosemary Clooney and Bing playing off of each other (I just wish that Rosemary's vocals could have been included on the soundtrack.  Her version of Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me is wonderful) and Vera-Ellen (though maybe not the best actress) makes the dance numbers pop through the screen.It might have been bigger and louder to compete with TV, but this is a great movie no matter how you cut it.

It is a pleasure to watch, and as the cover of my DVD says a lovely classic,in which dreams come true. The events work out well, in a credible way. Since the narrative unfolds in show business, all passions can be readily supported by magnificent sing- and dance-acts. The atmosphere of Christmas is captured extremely well, with Christmas trees, holly, snow, bells, Santa Claus costumes, and a cozy fireplace. Don't expect any references to the little child Jesus. The theme is the power of the old-boys network, in this case the strong bonding between the soldiers of a company, that fought during WW2. The general is a real peoples manager, and is adored by (most of) his subordinates We'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go. After the war he starts a hotel business in Vermont. Since he can use some publicity, his former subordinates Bob Hope and Danny Kaye, who are successful entertainers in show business, decide to do their rehearsals in the hotel. In addition they organize a giant reunion for the company there. It is actually not a dream, but good fun and nostalgia and re-bonding. On their way Hope and Kaye meet two sisters, Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen, and all experience love at first sight, in a compatible way. Even this is credible, considering the reputations of Hope and Kaye. In short the general, the four stars and the audience have a wonderful and self-assuring time. Luck reaches its climax, when suddenly the snow starts to fall. Snow in Vermont, this ensures a busy season for the generals hotel. Will the dream continue? Will luck last? Who knows? The hotel may well establish itself. Concerning the relations between Hope-Clooney and Kaye-Ellen I am not so sure, because from the start they look a bit shaky. But don't worry, thanks to their networks replacements will soon be found. All in all, the film White Christmas is a lovely film to watch in the domestic circle, during the darkest days of the year.Will the film itself last? The small number of reviews is astonishing. But it is indeed mainly the film of my parents, in a time when music and dance were still appreciated by the cinema spectators. Perhaps at that time the people craved for simple happiness, after the Depression and the war. I have inherited a liking for musicals and operas, but clearly the genre has become obsolete, at least in this shape. Modern people get bored by an indulgent narrative, that is devoid of any lessons of life. They expect drama or satire. It may well be, that White Christmas is a product of its period, that can not stand the judgment of time, and is eventually banned to the archives.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for nostalgia, but this one appears to have aged rather poorly, perhaps for no other reason than the passage of time and changing tastes.Probably the thing that works against the film the most is the choice of songs that have nothing to do with Christmas or the holiday season. Yes, there's the title song and repeated lines from 'Snow', but what's up with the 'Mandy' dance number and the 'Choreography' routine. Rosemary Clooney's Carousel Club song, Love, You Done Me Wrong seemed particularly troubling, even though it momentarily fit her situation with the Bingster. Also, another poster on this board had it right about What Can You Do With A General - I actually picked up the video sleeve to remind me what I was watching.Apart from the actual story, there's no reason not to admire the talent on display by the principals. To my mind, there's no finer singing voice than Bing Crosby's. Danny Kaye is spirited as Bing's partner, but he does tap that arm a bit much in the later going. Clooney's charm manages to come through her reserved character, but the showstopper if there is one would be Vera-Ellen in that 'Mandy' routine, watching leaves one almost as breathless as she should have been while doing it.Except for the title and the packaging, White Christmas has no claim on the truly great holiday films like It's A Wonderful Life or the Alastair Sim A Christmas Carol. The only thing I WOULD like to know is if Emma (Mary Wickes) ever DID resign from 'Busybody's Anonymous'.

In 1943 he had made the film Holiday Inn with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, as song and dance partners who split when Crosby decides to leave the act, and Astaire tries to settle down with the woman in the act that both men loved. Crosby turns his farm in Connecticut into an occasional bed and breakfast inn that is opened only on twelve national holidays, and produces special shows for the guests on those nights, with Marjorie Reynolds as his new partner. Astaire (after getting the heave-ho from his girlfriend) shows up with their agent (Walter Abel) and tries to romance Reynolds away from the inn and Crosby.Eleven years later Berlin decided the time was ripe for a remake, and originally planned to have Astaire in it again (it would have been the third Crosby-Astaire film, with Blue Skies as the center one). Astaire could not be in the film, and eventually the role went to Danny Kaye. One wonders if the original script of Holiday Inn would have been used or a version of it. As it was, the new film was also set in a New England inn (in Vermont this time), and the story borrows a shade or two from Berlin's World War I musical Yip Yip Yaphank as well as his World War II war morale film This Is The Army.Now Crosby is prominent singer and performer who was drafted and is a Captain in a regiment near the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. The Major General commanding is Dean Jagger, although as the film begins he is on the verge of retiring. However, Jagger is present when the men, led by Crosby and assisted by energetic and talented private Danny Kaye, put on a Christmas show. Shortly afterward, Kaye saves Crosby's life when he knocks him out of the way of a collapsing brick wall, and suffers an injury. Crosby, as a promise, agrees to sing a song Kaye composed (as a duet - so Kaye has to sing it too) in his first performance after the war. As a result Crosby and Kaye become partners - eventually becoming like Rodgers and Hammerstein producers of shows as well.They meet a pair of singing and dancing sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney) in Florida, and end up with the girls in the latter's next booking at an inn in Vermont. The inn looks like it should be a success, but it is on the verge of bankruptcy, especially as the temperature has been too hot for snow in December. Also the inn is run by Jagger, assisted by a young granddaughter and Mary Wickes. The plot of the film runs into two slots - will Crosby and Clooney and Kaye and Vera-Ellen get together, and will they be able to Jagger become successful without hurting his pride.The film may have started as a clone of Holiday Inn, but it stands on it's own feet well. There is a nasty taste left in viewing Holiday Inn, with Astaire as bounder - villain willing to break up Crosby's romances because of his own needs. WHITE Christmas does not have that. Kaye is willing to remind Crosby about the act of saving his life from time to time, but he actually is quite protective of Crosby's interests, including hoping to help Crosby settle down with a proper wife (though, oddly enough, he never thinks of marriage himself). Their care for Jagger's plight is also well accepted by the audience. Compare it with Walter Abel's constant looking for some type of long term show-biz contract to take to his clients (especially Astaire in fact Abel continuously works for Astaire's benefit at the expense of Crosby in Holiday Inn). In short, the motivation of the leads in White Christmas is far more admirable.The tunes in White Christmas were actually far more memorable than the ones in Holiday Inn, except for Easter Parade and White Christmas.They include a revival of the song Mandy which had been sung in Eddie Cantor's film Kid Millions in 1937. The one real negative I found was that in White Christmas the lead-in to Mandy was a number glorifying minstrel shows. I doubt that African-American today would appreciate that number very much. But at least it was not done in black-face, as the Abraham number in Holiday Inn was. Somehow both films would have been different regarding those film sequences today if they were being remade.

Compared with Frank Capra's 1946 masterpiece IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE , the 1954 Paramount musical is a negligible trifle. I suspect what compels people to watch it year after year has more to do with nostalgia than anything else. WHITE Christmas is ultimately an enjoyable , even moving experience because it evokes a simpler , more innocent time. Produced less than a decade after World War 2 , the picture's screenwriters use the memory of the war to give the story some dramatic weight but most of the movie is a succession of musical dance numbers , some better than others. With song contributions from Irving Berlin , most written expressly for the movie ( the exception being the title song , which originally debuted in 1942's HOLIDAY INN ) and with great vocals by stars Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney , WHITE Christmas is really a must -see. Its hackneyed plot about two war buddies who form a song and dance act , meet a sister act , fall in love and then help save their old Army general's failing Vermont Inn is pure cornball. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play the song and dance team of Wallace and Davis with great verve , with the same kind of chemistry that distinguished the Crosby and Hope Road movies Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen compliment the two men beautifully , Clooney with her rich , expressive singing voice and Ellen with her considerable dancing pyrotechnics. These powerhouse talents can't supplant a woefully weak script but they do manage to take your mind off it often enough to enjoy all the professionalism involved. WHITE Christmas is the work of many seasoned professionals , starting with prolific director Michael Curtiz , a veteran of the silent days who went on to helm the Academy Award winning CASABLANCA among other notable entertainments ; the venerable Irving Berlin , whose songs , even the lesser ones that fill this movie , are never less than enjoyable ; the wonderful supporting performances of Dean Jagger , the epitome of the grand old army man , and Mary Wickes , the nosy but lovable Innkeeper. The movie became the biggest box-office hit of 1954 , opening in October and playing to full houses right through the New Year. It garnered only one Oscar nomination , not surprisingly for Mr. Berlin , who penned the lovely lullaby Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep. Rosemary Clooney was showcased not only as a splendid singer but a first rate actress as well. And of course Berlin's masterwork , the movie's title song , was given two terrific renditions , one sung by Crosby near the battlefield accompanied by a plaintive music box , the other a rousing Technicolor finale joined by the entire cast and chorus. WHITE Christmas is overly -sentimental , often silly and sometimes even preposterous. But it's a hard movie to fight. If you are feeling the least bit sentimental and start to watch this holiday staple , for better or worse you'll most likely succumb to its ragged charms.

I HATE reviewing classics because who am I to say whether it is good or not because just out of sheer respect and longevity, obviously timeless classics are so for a reason. So I am strictly going by how it made me feel. White Christmas was cute, and it was fun and it certainly has plenty of song and dance routines for those 50's and 60's dance movie fans. The problem is that I just found it sort of ho hum. It never really takes off, I found some of the performances rather sluggish and certainly the pacing for the movie was sluggish. It did not need to be two hours long by any stretch and it just felt like it went on and on with the same concept. Secondly I don't think this really had to be a Christmas movie. Obviously it was built off the insane success of the Christmas song classic White Christmas but the entire film feels like Christmas is an afterthought and almost forced into the story. It would have made a much better comedy-romance without the Christmas theme.Bing Crosby is a brilliant singer and this is the first time I've seen him acting and honestly I didn't think much. I thought his performance was wooden and monotone a lot of the time until he sang which of course is amazing. The romance focusing on his character felt lost because he just looked so unimpressed most of the time and just really not the acting type I think. He looked even worse next to Danny Kaye who is nothing short of brilliant as the boisterous and loud Phil Davis. Kaye steals every scene between them and is just more comfortable and so much more charismatic on screen. He had some edge about him and some machismo but delivered his lines perfectly. Legendary singer Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen are the sisters that capture the two guys' hearts. They are good, but I just didn't feel like they were great. The chemistry between the four of them was just okay although I thought Kaye and Ellen had better chemistry than the other two. Dean Jagger and Mary Wickes play decent roles but quite small, definitely supporting characters.The dance numbers are splashy and elaborate and fun to watch. However, after the first two you'll feel like you've seen it all before. Even some of the songs just feel like the same thing over and over again. The ending of the film was actually what really got me. It was a great ending and almost brought me to tears which is pretty good considering I thought the rest of the film was just all around average. I love musicals and this one just felt like it didn't try hard enough. But then I have to repeat what do I know because this is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time. I know that this won't make a permanent spot in my Holiday rotation, it just didn't impress me but I would never presume to tell anyone not to watch a classic, it simply didn't impress me at all. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Thought it would be better.","Date":"17 December 2011","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" I liked the movie a lot.

The songs are catchy (a little TOO catchy) and the script is memorable (and predictable). But it seemed like the studio was trying very hard to throw a script together after they realized the actual song White Christmas (sung by Crosby in Holiday Inn) was a huge success.The memorable actress in the film shouldn't be Rosemary Clooney, but her 'sister' Vera Ellen. Clooney masks a great performance with awful lip-syncing that's not convincing even for a two year old, as well as a romantic lead role that she doesn't come out with until the very end of the film.Danny Kaye is a joy as usual, as is Bing Crosby with his mediocre acting but very entertaining singing voice. Kaye (in my book) is a greater Hollywood gem than Crosby who should have been the leads in many films, however he seemed to do better as the 'comic relieving sidekick.'

It's `White Christmas,' directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen.  One of the most popular films of 1954, it opens and closes with the title song, while in between it's filled with one great musical number after another.  It's just after the Second World War; the popular General Waverly (Dean Jagger) has retired to run an inn in Vermont, while a couple of his men, Captain Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Private Phil Davis (Kaye) have gone on to fame and fortune in show biz.  During a Christmas break from their successful show in New York, Wallace and Davis follow an up-and-coming act known as `The Haynes Sisters' (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to Vermont, where they discover their former commander is in trouble; there hasn't been any snow this year, and no snow means no business at the inn for General Waverly.  But not to worry; with Wallace and Davis on hand, as well as the Haynes sisters, the General's problems are as good as solved.  It's just a matter of figuring out exactly how to go about it, which-- and, of course, it's not much of a surprise-- they do.  And along the way the audience is treated to some spirited and memorable production numbers.  They just don't make &#145;em like this any more, and it's a shame.  Because this is pure entertainment, and one great show.	Veteran director Curtiz, who directed his first film in 1912 in his native Hungary, consistently demonstrated his versatility again and again with films ranging from `Yankee Doodle Dandy,' `Life With Father' and `Casablanca,' to later fare such as `King Creole' in 1958 (which starred Elvis Presley).  And with this one he certainly proved that he knew his way around a musical.  Granted, it was hard to go wrong with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney and Vera-Ellen on board, but there's a big difference between delivering a finished product and making a great movie; and this one definitely falls into the latter category.  The story is solid, and Curtiz makes the most of the talent at his disposal.  Bing is at his best, and the antics of Danny Kaye are a joy to behold, as are the delightful song stylings of Rosemary Clooney.  But with all that talent on hand, the single element that truly takes this film to that higher plateau is the presence of the perky and winsome Vera-Ellen.  	Thought by many to be the best dancer ever to be a part of the studio system, Vera-Ellen is an absolute delight in this film.  Though she couldn't sing (her singing was dubbed by Trudy Stevens), what she could do on a dance floor more than made up for it.  Whether it's the `Sisters' number with Clooney, one with Danny Kaye or just with the guys in the chorus, she is mesmerizing to watch.  It may be a style that defines another era, but when she's dancing-- like Gene Kelley-- it's a timeless proposition and becomes entertainment that belongs to the ages.  It's just such a joy to watch someone like Vera-Ellen do what she does best.  It's transporting.  And when you consider that she is but a part of the equation here, it's easy to understand why this film remains so popular to this day. 	The wonderful Danny Kaye gives a terrific performance here, as well.  It may lack one of the tongue-twisting numbers he was famous for, but he still has ample opportunities to showcase his many and varied talents, which he most certainly does.  There was never any question that this was Bing's picture, but he couldn't have asked for a better second banana than the charismatic Kaye who, like Vera-Ellen, is virtually spellbinding when he's doing what he does best, which is just about anything he does in this film, whether it's singing, dancing, mugging or just throwing out a line to Crosby.  	Clooney's part may not be as flashy as those of her co-stars, but she sure can sell a song, and whether it's a solo or a duet with Bing or Vera-Ellen, there's no doubt that it's another of the many strengths of this film.  And she mixes well with the laid-back Bing who, though clearly the star of the show, demonstrates his generosity as an actor by always allowing and never begrudging his co-stars their time in the spotlight.  Crosby was a star and he knew it without having to prove anything; he also knew there was plenty of star dust to go around, and because he let it his movies (this one included) were all the better for it.  	The supporting cast includes Mary Wickes (Emma), John Brascia (Joe), Anne Whitfield (Susan), Richard Shannon (Adjutant), Grady Sutton (General's guest), Herb Vigran (Novello), Johnny Grant (Ed Harrison) and Percy Herbert (Train Conductor).  Thoroughly entertaining in the truest sense of the word, `White Christmas' is an engaging, enduring and uplifting film that will whisk you away to a magic place in your heart and in your mind.  It's so refreshing to take this journey to a time that may not have in reality been any easier, but at least seemed simpler and somehow less convoluted than our present era of `political correctness.'  A time in which films like this one were not only able to be made, but were subsequently welcomed and embraced by audiences everywhere.  Today, we have `Harry Potter,' a new kind of magic and a great film in it's own right; but there will always be a place for Bing and his bunch, because theirs was a magic all their own, the kind that's lasting and immortal.  And it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

Crosby and Kaye? Rosemary Clooney looks good and sings beautifully, and Vera-Ellen performs at her usual high-energy level (in several scenes she's paired with George Chakiris for dances that are clearly beyond Crosby and Kaye's skill level).The entire plot of the movie is that the sad-sack Dean Jagger is now sad because he's running a hotel instead of being a general in the army. Crosby and Kaye decide to put on a show to cheer him up, and Rosemary Clooney somehow becomes convinced that they are trying to embarrass him. That's it. Who cares? I guess. The musical numbers are pretty good, mostly dug up from Irving Berlin's endless box of old numbers from his Music Box Revue days.

For the rest of the running time it's a rather typical Hollywood musical of its era warm, good-natured, with lots of well-choreographed dance and singing routines, and a feel-good storyline. It's not my favourite of its type - I'm a sucker for Gene Kelly - but as a Christmas musical, it shines.Bing Crosby is the obvious draw here as the film belongs to him throughout, but the supporting cast are effective too. Danny Kaye has a fairly difficult role I reckon, playing second-string to Crosby, but he comes off as amiable enough. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen are fine as the singing sisters. Like many of its type, White Christmas flags a little in between the songs, but the musical numbers are well staged and likable, so there's little to complain about overall.

Because of this recording I made back then, I memorized the lyrics to all the songs, and most of the dialogue. When the VHS tape came out, I bought it, and right now I'm watching the remastered DVD on my wide-screen high def TV. I've also seen the movie in theatres a couple of times over the years. You'd think after all that, I'd be tired of it. No way. It's hard to say what makes this movie magical. So many people have written about it, here, I don't have much to add. One of those times I saw it in a theatre, I was walking up the aisle behind a couple of young guys and one of them was saying he had never seen Bing Crosby before. I thought he was fantastic, he said. What a charming guy! Try to picture this film with someone other than Bing in the lead. It's the only time Bing and Danny Kaye did a movie together, and the only reason is that Donald O'Connor fell ill and the replacements considered - reportedly, Fred Astaire and Bob Hope - weren't available. Yet Bing and Danny make a really compatible team. It's too bad they never tried another musical together.The casting just works. Think about how it wouldn't work at all if Bing had been paired with Vera Ellen, or Danny with Rosemary Clooney. Bing and Rosie got together on several albums as well as a radio series and later a concert tour. Their personalities and voices go so well together. And Danny and Vera had been together on the screen before, too. Dean Jagger is perfect as General Waverly, as is Mary Wickes as his housekeeper, Emma Allen.And the script is great! The plot may be thin but when the dialogue is as smart, sharp and with-it as this is, a fussy, complicated plot only gets in the way. This is a musical, after all. Norman Krasna, plus the writing-producing-directing team of Norman Panama and Melvin Frank (employed here only as writers), give the stars so many good lines! And these pros do such a fine job of making it all seem very natural and like it was all happening for the first time. Rosie proves she has acting as well as singing talent - watch how she listens and reacts in the most spontaneous way. And, like Bing, she had a marvelous speaking voice as well as a singing voice. Since Danny Kaye replaced another actor, he doesn't have as much of his usual shtick to do and, more interestingly, he doesn't play as neurotic or offbeat a character as he usually did. Just a regular guy, for once. He's still very funny, but he's more of a charming, good-looking leading man. And even though he is, technically, the second lead, he's just as strong as Bing and therefore doesn't seem like he's in support at all. It's his picture too.Vera-Ellen doesn't actually have all that much dialogue compared to the other three leads, but she does make her scenes count, has a believable relationship with Clooney as her older sister (Rosemary was actually younger), and is clever with Kaye. Her dancing is of course terrific, and she gets several numbers, with either Kaye or John Braccia (who seems to have been hired when Donald O'Connor was out), or both. Watching this so many times, I've started to notice a few errors in continuity. For instance, when Bob and Phil get on the train and are told by the conductor there are no more beds to be had, but they're welcome to purchase tickets and sit up all night in the club car. Then they pass the drawing room that was going to be theirs until Phil gave the tickets to the Haynes sisters. The Haynes sisters are in it. The boys then proceed to the club car, the Haynes sisters join them for some food, and a song (Snow)...and the next scene is in Vermont. The next morning? And we now see the interior a sleeper car, Phil and Bob entering, with Betty and Judy getting ready to leave their bunks, having spent the night in an upper and a lower! How did they get there? What happened to the drawing room? Did Bob and Phil end up back in it, rather than staying up in the club car? If so, how did the Haynes sisters score bunks, when there were none available on the train to begin with? Seems like they cut out a scene. Of course it doesn't make sense either than Phil has packed, and is now wearing, a long a furry coat, winter hat, long underwear, etc. He didn't get to purchase any of this stuff before boarding the train in Florida. But don't think too hard about it. As Alfred Hitchcock often said, It's only a movie. Anyway, this one is beautifully staged and directed, with melodious songs by Irving Berlin (including maybe his last great one, the gorgeous Count Your Blessings), fantastic Edith Head costumes, and terrific orchestrations by Van Cleave. All filmed in crisp VistaVision and Technicolor. What are you waiting for?

It starts on a battlefield in Europe in the winter of 1944, and a soldier with a beautiful singing voice gently voices a prayer for a white Christmas that perhaps says more about the state of mind of the troops than any terrifyingly violent action film could say. The movie ends up being about finding love, self and some measure of contentment in the period after the war, and for that it packs more feeling than it first appears. For all of its clunky moments, it helps us find a meaningful Christmas. "},{"Title":"A classic Christmas film and top selling song of all time","Date":"29 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" Irving Berlin's White Christmas movie almost was a classic when it came out in 1954. That's because the title song had been out for 12 years, and was made hugely popular after its first use in the 1942 film, Holiday Inn. It won the Oscar that year for best original song. The song already had broken sales records and was an annual Christmas favorite. So, even with as long as it took 20th Century Fox to make the film, the movie was seen as a sure-fire hit musical and comedy romance. The delay was mostly in trying to fill the role of Phil Davis, played by Danny Kaye. Fred Astaire declined the role and Donald O'Connor became ill just before shooting began. Perhaps providence had a hand in the delay, because I don't think any long-time movie buffs today could imagine anyone other than Danny Kaye in that role. The movie premiered Oct. 14, 1954, and became the top moneymaking film for the year. It had $12 million in box office sales (about $105 million in 2014 dollars). The second highest grossing film that year was The Caine Mutiny, at $8.7 million. Moreover, the record sales of the song continued to ring up. According to Guinness World Records, Bing Crosby's recording of White Christmas holds the world record as the best- selling single recording of all time. As of 2014, Crosby's recording tops 50 million, and the total sales of White Christmas by all recordings tops 100 million. Today this movie endures, along with It's a Wonderful Life, as the two 'must' original films on all lists for annual family viewing over the holidays. Without a doubt, this is the best musical of the season. Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol is the third movie that is on most lists for annual viewing; but viewers have a choice of several different renditions to choose from. Any of four of those are very good. What's not to like about White Christmas? It's a wonderful story of the early musical play versions where the entertainment is the profession of the stars. The plot is very good, with some sub-plots interwoven. It's a nice romance and light comedy of the everyday life variety. And it has wonderful music, singing and dancing. This film is packed with talent. It has 17 songs &#x96; all written by Irving Berlin, and several dance numbers. The songs are a mix of previous numbers and entirely new ones. Several were Berlin hits that are still played today. Some have been used or can be heard in movies in the 21st century. Besides White Christmas, these include Heat Wave, The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep, and Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me.Kaye has a couple dance numbers and one with Vera-Ellen who shows her dance talent in several other numbers. Rosemary Clooney plays half of the Haynes sisters act (as Betty) with Vera-Ellen's Judy; and she's also the romance interest with Crosby. Other top cast members include veteran actors Dean Jagger, Mary Wickes and Sig Ruman. Two future stars are in the music and dance cast &#x96; Barrie Chase and George Chakiris. This wonderful film never wears thin for viewing year after year. The songs and dance numbers will always entertain any audience. And the story is a nice holiday tale of friendship, romance, kindness and fun. It's a classic that families will enjoy for generations to come.

Originally performed by Bing in the 1942 film Holiday Inn, it wasn't long before Hollywood realised that the song was a sure-fire winner and it has become the most recorded Christmas song in history. So it's only natural to produce a film based around the song, right? Well, not exactly - this glitzy musical does indeed feature Bing and the rest of the cast singing the song but it offers lots more besides such as unexpected comedy, a suitably schmaltzy romance and more Irving Berlin numbers than a Michael Ball compilation.Teaming up during World War 2, singer Bob Wallace (Crosby) and entertainer Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) form a highly successful double-act touring the US with a variety of shows once the war has finished. After meeting fellow double-act and sisters Judy (Vera-Ellen) and Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney) and helping them escape from their landlord, they move to Vermont and unwittingly stay at a hotel ran by their former commanding officer, General Waverly (Dean Jagger). But due to a lack of snow, the hotel's future is under threat and Bob hatches a plan to help his old buddy out. Phil and Judy, meanwhile, begin to hatch a match-making plan of their own...It's easy to forget that musical movies like White Christmas are part of a long-ago era where the films would stop altogether for a song and/or dance routine. Watching it today, I was amazed at the leading cast who were so incredibly versatile - Crosby and Clooney were amazingly talented singers, Kaye had a subtle but effective sense of comic timing while Vera-Ellen was an astonishingly flexible dancer but all of them could do so much more. Having never seen a movie with any of them in before (I know, shoot me!), it was a stark reminder that Hollywood today is a much less talented place than it was back then - hard to imagine who could be recast if a remake was forthcoming. But it shouldn't - the film's enthusiastic cast and exuberant musical numbers make this film a winner. The plot might be little to write home about and the obvious homage to the aforementioned Holiday Inn might be lost on most modern viewers today. And call me soft but the relationship between Crosby (who was in his fifties) and Clooney (still in her twenties) felt a little icky, given the obvious age difference. I guess some things in Tinseltown never change...But despite being cornier than a Jim Davidson joke, White Christmas just about pulls it off through a combination of old fashioned talent and unadulterated festive cheer. It lacks the magic of my favourite yuletide film It's A Wonderful Life and if you've got younger viewers with you then I suspect the film's pace might make them wish for the likes of Elf or Frozen. But if you've grown up with it, I can see why this holiday staple has bowled you over. If Chicago was a bit too stagey for you (and frankly, I didn't enjoy it at all) then settle down and enjoy this nostalgic slice of vintage Hollywood glamour. They just don't make 'em like this any more...

It's mainly about the singing and dancing, which is all top-notch. The plot is kind of thin, but it is sweet and sentimental. This movie was a product of America's greatest generation, and it is a testament to the fact that that generation truly was better, in every sense, than the generations that followed. It sad that the stars of this movie are all gone, and this probably is true of most everyone who had anything to do with it. Every aspect of the production quality is first-rate. The film quality is superb and has not deteriorated, as evidenced by the superb picture quality on a modern HDTV. Sound recording has improved since then, but the sound quality is as good as it needs to be. Just a thoroughly movie, that allows you to relax for a couple of hours and forget about whatever it is that you worry about. There are no shoot-outs, robberies, rapes, ax murders, or autopsies. It is a sad commentary on where we have come in the sixty years since this movie was made, that Hollywood movies and television shows need to have those elements in order to be financially successful. Well, not always, but more often than not. Call it fluff if you want, but in spite of being fluff, and partly because of it, White Christmas is a unique, special movie, pretty much in a category of its own, and without question one of the better movies that was ever made.

I watch this film almost every Christmas, and let's face it -- Bing is the focus of the film -- and he really was never better. For one thing, watch his face carefully during some of the musical numbers...he's visibly having fun. I'd have to say that at least in terms of film, he was at his absolute peak here, doing rather nicely in the dance numbers, and of course in the singing department.But aside from that, this is one of the best musicals...and it didn't come out of MGM. Paramount did this one up big! The Technicolor and Vista Vision (the first of the latter) are stunning.Despite having a fairly large cast, there are really only 6 main character. Bing and Danny Kaye play a song and dance team that headlined after the end of WWII, but it's especially interesting to see how nicely and sentimentally the battleground scene was filmed. Danny feels Bing is lonely, and is intent to match him up with a woman. Along comes the sister-singers -- Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen (although in reality, Vera-Ellen's numbers are dubbed, in part by Clooney herself!) As with many romantic comedies there are a number of misunderstandings, taking the story from Florida to the winter wonderland of Vermont...where there's now snow. Where they bump into the boy's old General -- Dean Jagger -- now a floundering lodge owner. And his nemesis is housekeeper Mary Wickes.Bing was wonderful in movies, and especially so here. I seriously dislike Danny Kaye as a performer, but I do admire this performance, including his wonderful dance number with Vera-Ellen (The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing). Rosemary Clooney was delightful in her somewhat spiteful character, but it all ends in romance, with a few spats in between. Her specialty number Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me is terrific. Jagger is at his most ingratiating here, and it was in this general time period that he did some of his best supporting-actor work. Vera-Ellen's dancing is stupendous, and it's easy to see why some consider her the finest of the female dancers.And then, of course, there are the Irving Berlin songs White Christmas (which opens and closes the film), The Old Man (a sentimentally wonderful tribute to the general by Crosby and Kaye), Sisters (by Clooney & Vera-Ellen, and then hilariously reprised by Bing and Danny), The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing (which includes a wonderful dance routine by Kaye and Vera-Ellen), the imaginative Snow (with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney & Vera-Ellen), I'd Rather See a Minstrel Show/Mister Bones/Mandy (Crosby, Kaye, Clooney,& Chorus; although it shows off Vera-Ellen's legs in a way that betray her anorexia); the timeless Count Your Blessings (by Crosby & Clooney; just why did Eddie Fisher's recorded version become the hit?), Choreography (by Kaye, and the one number in the film I despise and fast forward through each year), the sentimental What Can You Do with a General? (Crosby), and the nifty Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army (Crosby, Kaye, Clooney & Stevens). I'm not sure there has ever been a better cluster of Irving Berlin songs in any one movie (although, admittedly, some are recycled, including the title song).All in all, a smash film that was the top-moneymaker of 1954, and still wears extremely well. I treasure it!BTW, the Blu-Ray version of this is (for the most part) a real quality transfer...wonderfully vivid.

Basically a remake of 1942's Holiday Inn where the title song from this movie was introduced (and deservedly won an Oscar), it adds color, camp, and Danny Kaye to the familiar story. Danny takes over in the role Fred Astaire played in Holiday Inn, and his character adds comedy into the mix, some funny, some cloying. Technicolor loves Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, and they wear all sorts of gorgeous gowns. Unfortunately, this mixture of pastiche and Technicolor ends up being an extremely mixed bag that brings huge smiles in some scenes, rolled eyes in others.The campiest moment comes with the duet of Sisters, first seen with Vera-Ellen and Clooney, and later repeated by the mincing Crosby and Kaye. The later version was apparently done as a gag and kept in the film. A big production number saluting the old minstrel shows features the tackiest of jokes and the ugliest of costumes. It worked great in Kid Millions in 1934, but in the post war world of 1954, it is a major groaner of a number. Even duller is Kaye's Choreography, as pretentious as it sounds. He does get a nice duet with Vera-Ellen, The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, while Crosby and Clooney get to sing the beautiful Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. Clooney gets a good solo moment with Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me, a mediocre song which becomes better simply because of how she sells it.As for the Christmas sequences, they open and end the film, hence the reason for the title. Dean Jagger plays the retiring General who moves to the aforementioned Holiday Inn after the end of World War II, and is given a rousing send-off. Mary Wickes shines as his housekeeper, but then again, doesn't she always shine no matter what film she's in? The two major Christmas songs are the title song, first repeated by Crosby (who introduced it in Holiday Inn) and later utilized for the lavish finale where the hotel walls open up like a Broadway set. I guess you're supposed to really feel the Christmas spirit when this happens, but had the whole story surrounded the holidays rather than just the opening and conclusion, I would have been much happier. A minor little number, Snow, celebrates the season nicely, but its not one of Berlin's better songs. Michael Curtiz seems an odd choice for director of a big, elephantine musical. This was a busy time for Irving Berlin as he just had another catalog of his songs done on screen (the much better There's No Business Like Show Business) and the previous year's Call Me Madam, both with Ethel Merman. So while he may have been considered, as Jerome Kern called him, American Music, he was represented elsewhere. This musical certainly has its fans, and while I applaud much of what is in here, I have to consider this one a missed opportunity, much like Crosby's next remake of an old film of his, Anything Goes, where the same studio forgot that it was based on an old Cole Porter hit, and equally as disengaging.

IN THE OLDEST and most steadfast tradition of Hollywood, the production crew took various bits and pieces from the previously successful movies and mixed them up a little, hit the plot from a little angle and, Presto! We have a new film.OTHER THAN THE two elements from the technological guys, there is nothing really new. The scientific guys came up with the wide screen, VistaVision; which was Paramount's answer to 20th Century-Fox's Cinemascope. To this they added the most beautiful Technicolor work imaginable. IN THIS CASE, it was Paramount Pictures that took some of the musical numbers from Irving Berlin's HOLIDAY INN. They then relocated in time and space to a Connecticut resort hotel, post World War II (in approximately real time, 1954). It was placed at that time of year leading up to the Christmas Season.ADDING SOME ROMANCE for the two male leads, Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, in the persons of Singer Rosemary Clooney and Dancer Vera-Ellen as a pair of sisters, the story had its proper 1950s rationing of titillation and S-E-X.AND WHILE WE'RE on the subject of the principal Male players, we'd like to run this one idea by you.

As a railroad train buff, I'd just like to comment on the scene when the gang is traveling by train from Florida to Vermont. The railroads they most likely would have used would have been either Seaboard Air Lines, Atlantic Coast Line, or Florida East Coast to at least New York. Then they would change railroads again to the New Haven to Boston and eventually Vermont. Instead, the director used a clip of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe's (ATSF) San Diegan passenger train as it raced along the Pacific coast between Los Angeles and San Diego. Then the film quickly showed a Southern Pacific train with Black Widow F units leading old heavy weight passenger cars speeding along near Beaumont Pass (Banning,CA) where, if you look quickly, you will spot the snow covered San Bernardino mountains in the distance. While it's not accurate as far as the railroads Hollywood could have shown here, it's still fun to see both these trains in color speeding along from so long ago.

That's because it is filmed in breathtaking Technicolor and the then-new wide screen process of VistaVision. Also, the soundtrack is an early attempt at hi-fi stereo, involving both magnetic and optical elements. O.K. the story is thin A successful song and dance team travel from Florida to Vermont because Danny Kaye plays matchmaker for Bing Crosby. They happen upon their former Army general who now owns a Vermont ski resort on the verge of failure due to no snow and no business. So, naturally they bring their entire New York Broadway show up there, at great expense so the general will be a success. A grist mill and barn are transformed into a theater. A full set of lights and rigging are installed. (Sure, anyone can install a full set of counterweights for curtains and scenery--it's a snap!) The songs range from wonderful to awful. The worst Choreography and What Do You Do with a General...? The awkward Mandy and Abraham are minstrel numbers done without blackface make-up. (Thank God!) Several great songs Count Your Blessings, The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, Snow, White Christmas, and more. Several cameo performances including the funny and beautiful Barrie Chase. (Mutual,I'm sure)Why does this film work? Well, Vera-Ellen is fantastic, sexy, and wow!...can she tap dance! Michael Curtiz is a brilliant director. The cast is fabulous. Most of the production numbers are great and the film plays like a variety show--uneven, but with some showstoppers along the way.Production shortcomings Obviously filmed entirely indoors on soundstages, the battlefront scenes look entirely artificial. Vera-Ellen is painfully-thin, so Edith Head costumed her in over-sized clothes and bulky sweaters. Bing is almost the same age as the general. Why couldn't they get the real Ed Sullivan? The ballet children in the finale look unhappy. (I suspect a very long production-day (or days) with several re-takes.)Amazingly filmed in only three months, a great movie musical anyway! Fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. A beautiful presentation which has made millions for Paramount in video sales.Holiday Inn (now available colorized) is actually a better film with better songs. (In that film, Bing Crosby is on the verge of bankruptcy because his dinner-show inn is failing.) Note Fred Astaire passed on White Christmas because he didn't like the script.

Here (though not for the first time), Crosby croons the title song as an entire film is built around it.  The plot is very thin, almost a throwback to the Hey!  Let's put on a show in the barn!-type of Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland films.  Here, Crosby and war buddy Kaye have developed a major variety act and, as a favor, help out Vera-Ellen and Clooney who find themselves in a jam.  The latter two are Sisters (as the song says.....and SAYS throughout!) who are booked into a ski lodge that has no snow in sight!  When Crosby and Kaye find that it's owned by their old general (Jagger), they decide to draw crowds with a huge Broadway-level show at the lodge.  A few minor romantic connections and complications are sprinkled in between the lavish musical numbers.  Casting is downright bizarre with relation to the script, but somehow the actors pull it off. Crosby, at 51, is way too old to be playing a recently discharged soldier who just hasn't found the right girl to settle down with and have nine kids!  He gives the film his patented slick performance (and there's a lot of make-up here!)  Kaye, in for an eleventh hour-departing Donald O'Connor, does a decent job.  He and Crosby do a somewhat uncomfortable number in partial drag with Crosby practically cracking up near the end of it.  Clooney, though younger than Vera-Ellen plays the older sister.  She is paired with Crosby who is twice her age.  Her stellar voice is given a decent workout on several songs and she's a lovely, natural presence in the film.  Vera-Ellen is undeniably talented as a dancer and really gets to strut her stuff here.  However, she is ghastly thin, with a waistline that gives new meaning to wasp-waist.  Her costumes all come up to her chin (and it was later revealed that Edith Head had to costume her this way to cover up a neck that was practically ruined by anorexia.)  In fact, it's rather sad to think that the stars who worked so hard to provide a charming, pleasing, perennial film fought such harrowing demons themselves.  Aside from Vera-Ellen's anorexia, Clooney suffered a nervous breakdown, Crosby had a tumultuous relationship with his sons and Kaye was reported to have some difficult sexual proclivities.  But, in any case, they left a colorful, sentimental film behind which, for many, is a yearly must-see.  Not every song is a stunner, but enough of them score a bullseye to make this worth viewing.  Also of note are Jagger's sentimental turn as the retired general and Wickes' busy-body housekeeper.  There are some nice costumes throughout, but none more dazzling than the ladies' long red gowns with white fur trim at the end.  It all ends as one would hope and no one is going to strain his brain trying to figure out the storyline, but for a cup of Christmas cheer, it hits the spot.

Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen go to bed at night in full shining make-up and styled hair.

His countless awards, movie ticket sales and television ratings indicate that a lot of people like him in a number of things. Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney have nothing to do with the picture's failings, either. This is Bing Crosby's film, and he carries it off with the assuredness of an accomplished performer. But with the obvious exceptions of Technicolor and VistaVision, this is not a marked improvement over Holiday Inn, where he previously costarred with Fred Astaire.

Sadly, I cannot, at least not very much. Set mostly post WWII, this one has Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye as discharged army buddies who make it big in show business, eventually winding up in a far-too-balmy Vermont (for December) trying their best to help their retired general (Dean Jagger) to make a go of his debt-ridden inn. Bing is the driven one, Kaye more the playboy, with Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen falling into line as the sister act/plot device that ushers in the clich√©-ridden romantic complications. A noble effort to be sure, the film struggles mightily to overcome its paint-by-numbers script and leaden direction, but all to no avail. Lacking even a modicum of genuine on-screen chemistry between Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, this bloated, lugubrious mishmash simply staggers from one over-produced dance routine to the next, literally at times 'stopping the show.' Yes, there are a few shiny bobbles to be found thanks to Bing's excellent vocalizing, the multi-talented Danny Kaye's sharp comedy timing (and hoofing), Vera-Ellen's superb dancing, and costumes icon Edith Head's wardrobe expertise. But that is it! All too often Bing Crosby looks decidedly uncomfortable and out of place, Rosemary Clooney appears to be auditioning to be the next Hitchcock 'ice-blond' and Michael Curtiz seems to have been bizarrely seized of the notion that 'sledgehammer directing' was the only way to ensure musical comedy success. Oh where was Stanely Donen when we needed him. Being a lover of musicals, and genuinely respecting the many great talents involved in this enterprise, it makes me very sad to come on as the Grinch with this one.

The movie does have a good resolution and a wonderful ending. What stands out to me is the attitude that there should be concerning Christmas.

For starters, this semi-remake of HOLIDAY INN doesn't hold a candle to anything in that movie. Every single item in the earlier film is much better than anything here so director Michael Curtiz isn't able to match anything. That wouldn't have been a problem had more simply been done here. There's no question that there are some good dance sequences as all four stars really give it their all. I think it would be fair to say that Kaye and Very-Ellen steal the film with their various dance scenes, which are clearly the highlight. There's also no denying that both Crosby and Clooney sound terrific together and they also have a nice spark that works in the romantic scenes. The biggest problem with the film is its screenplay, which is just one clich√© after another and it just never sparks to life. It also doesn't help that the majority of the Irving Berlin songs just seem like a poor imitation of something he would write.

Of course, Crosby sings and he is great, but as an actor his face is quite expressionless and he seems very stiff with the other actors.The comic relief to his straight man is Danny Kaye, who comes off more as whining and annoying than funny. They do sing and perform well together, but I got tired of him rather quickly. The ladies are Rosemary Clooney and Vera Allen, again both good at dancing and singing but needed help in the acting department.One other thing that bothered me about this movie is that it didn't seem to have the warmth and sincerity most Christmas movies do. Films like It's A Wonderful Life penetrate deep to our feelings and really make us care for the characters and their situations. This story feels more like a complete set-up in order to get these four to sing and dance. Even then, I wasn't real impressed by the numbers, particularly one rather unnecessary one that feels taken right out of Monty Python.I would still recommend others to see it if only for the final act which is both emotional and lovely.

And, when the duo meet two musical sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney), Danny and Vera just decide that Bing MUST marry Rosemary---just like that! Not surprisingly, there are MANY bumps and misunderstandings along the way--as, after all, it IS a very formulaic relationship. What is not exactly formula, however, is the parallel plot involving Danny and Bing's old commander--the General. The General is running a hotel in Vermont--but it's failing due to unusually hot weather. So, the four decide to get together and perform a show--just the sort of thing Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland would have done a decade and a half earlier.The film has a lot of pluses and minuses. As I mentioned above, the film is easy to predict due to its strong use of traditional film formulas. However, the actors did a nice job with what they had. My biggest complaint about the film were all the song and dance numbers. There were just too many and many were quite forgettable. Several could have been cut and more emphasis should have been on plot--but, considering how successful the film was, what do I know? I just know that today the film is a bit sluggish because of this. You cannot trim the title song, but a bit of trimming would have tightened up the film and kept a better pace. Overall, it's uneven but enjoyable.

Nor is it a rejuvenation of spirit story, like one expects with Christmas movies.  It's a musical, and a comedy, and a romance, but it isn't really a christmas movie.It's really best as a musical, part of a genre of films in which a plot is contrived in order to string together a catalog of songs, usually from one composer.  The result is seldom a great film (Singin' in the Rain being the notable exception), but in this case, the end product is entertaining and pleasant.  The comedy is fitful and sometimes annoying; Bing Crosby was in his full-blown hepcat phase, and the stupid lingo gets old fast.  Danny Kaye was (fortunately) subdued here compared to his solo comedies.  Because of their personalities, the men don't fare as well as the ladies in the romance department either.

There is no deeper message here, except I suppose some general one should help each other out- thing. The main story is too silly, and so are the two love-stories, the ending is too predictable, and apart from the title number there is not really much Christmas spirit to it.I find the two women entertainers very mediocre and uninteresting, and it does not surprise me that they never became great stars on par with their male co-actors. Danny Kaye is fun to look at I suppose, but I have never been a fan of him. Bing Crosby is the only one who lifts this production! He is as always very likable - he seems so decent and wholesome, and you become glad and full of hope when you see him. (Of course I have no idea if he was such a wonderful person in reality.)

The Sisters number is a classic and congratulations to the guy who persuaded Bing to leave it in the picture.

Plots would usually be flimsy and repetitive, and most of the effort would go into spectacular musical presentations. Even though it's now looked on as a rather outdated way of doing things, the backstager gave us many of our finest musicals &#x96; the Busby Berkeley pictures of the early 30s, the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers vehicles, and more recently the Arthur Freed production of The Band Wagon. As with any picture, it's all about getting the key elements right&#x85; or wrong as the case may be.The story of White Christmas is appropriately light, just enough to make an excuse for a string of musical numbers, allow for some romance between the principle players, as well as a bit of post-war nostalgia. It was perhaps this latter that made White Christmas such a big hit in its day, although it's a bit too underdeveloped to really wring out any emotion for audiences who don't have that context. The director Michael Curtiz was never really at ease with the musical genre, instead focusing more on bringing clarity to the story. He makes a rather noble effort, using smooth tracking shots to keep various character story arcs interlinked, but really there isn't enough of a story here to warrant that. And although Curtiz was a master at lifelike and meaningful crowd-shots (as best witnessed here in the final scene) he fails to make best use of the neat Bob Fosse choreography, and just distracts us with a lot of pointless dollying in and out of the musical numbers.Of course, cast matters massively in any picture like this, and Bing Cosby is always welcome &#x96; a wonderful singer as well as a fine actor. But he's underused on both counts here, appearing older, tired, and without the spark that he brought to his pictures in the 30s and 40s. Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen make lacklustre support, each one of them looking like second choices (which was more or less actually the case). Here and there is a hint that Clooney might actually be a great dramatic actress. If that's the case she's wasted here. On the non-musical side of things, Dean Jagger surely has the most important job as an actor, as he has to carry that poignant strand in the picture. Fortunately he manages this with naturalism and sensitivity. Beady-eyed musical fans may also spot a promising young George Chakiris (Bernardo in West Side Story) as a backing dancer in a couple of numbers.The title of this picture would naturally have us thinking of this as a Christmas movie. However, despite its theme it really lacks the cosy, glowing feeling of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, or even the less openly Christmassy Holiday Inn, in which the title song was first heard. But here White Christmas (the song) just comes across as another little presentation &#x96; it's far from being the heart of the picture. Irving Berlin was one of the finest songwriters ever to lend his talents to Hollywood, but unfortunately White Christmas (the movie) sells him short.And on that unseasonably gloomy note, here's wishing all IMDb users a merry and bright Christmas ;) "},{"Title":"White Christmas","Date":"7 January 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" Bing Crosby's most well-loved and Oscar winning Christmas song came from the film Holiday Inn, it became so popular, director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Mildred Pierce) was given the job to make a whole film out of it. Basically, in World War II, after leaving the army, Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) team up to become successful song and dance stage act, and also manage to get into Broadway as producers. In a night club, Bob is introduced to the Haynes sisters, Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney, George's aunt) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) who also sing and dance on stage, who end up following them all the way to a small Vermont lodge. Bob and Phil are really surprised to see their old commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger) as owner of the lodge, but he isn't having much luck with business. They come up with a plan to save his business with a song and dance act they created for Broadway, but brought to the small lodge instead. Obviously things don't go smoothly, there is a rift forming between Bob and Betty, even when they were originally smitten, and happy Phil and Judy try to get them back together. Eventually the whole show is brought together for a big surprise for Waverly as all his soldiers come to the show, and they sing and dance their Christmassy show with the snow falling outside. Also starring Mary Wickes as Emma Allen, John Brascia as John, Anne Whitfield as Susan Waverly and Sig Ruman as Landlord. Some of the dance sequences are fun to watch, and songs like The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Geee! I Wish I Was Back in the Army are catchy, and the performances are alright. It wasn't a bad film in any way, I did enjoy myself, and I can see why it would be given four stars, but the best part is indeed Crosby's treasured song, for that I would probably watch it again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments.

Holiday Inn (1942) introduced Irving Berlin's White Christmas, which won the Oscar for Best Song. It also plotted the story of a country inn only open on holidays, and, of course, starred Bing Crosby with his pipe and Fred Astaire as his dancing co-star. The non-singing though not bad dancing Marjorie Reynolds was cast as the female lead in what seemed to be Paramount's attempt to make a star of her in the same style that had recently failed with Mary Martin, who returned to Broadway to made show biz history.Another film, Here Come the Waves (1944), had twin sisters (played by Betty Hutton) who were a singing act and who each got respectively paired with the film's male stars Crosby, as a successful crooner, and Sonny Tufts, as, well, Sonny Tufts, as all of them go off to win World War II. The twin sisters element gave Betty Hutton the opportunity to play one sister as serious and the other in Hutton's popular bombastic style.These elements more or less combine in White Christmas, a typical movie musical enhanced by Technicolor and the new widescreen process VistaVision, which I believe Paramount initiated with this film. White Christmas never really interested me much, but I always liked the number, The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing, danced by Vera-Ellen and Danny Kaye.Rosemary Clooney's performance, however, grew more and more interesting with each viewing. This woman was not only strong but angry. About what is not so clear, but can be read as pre-women's movement discontent that somehow had seeped into a mainstream Hollywood musical, and may have been one of the reasons Clooney's film career lasted only several years. (Audiences' growing dissatisfaction with traditional movie musicals was also a factor.) Clooney and Crosby perfectly balance each other and I find it interesting to imagine them in a more serious film attempt at mid-1950s male/female relationships, although sometimes these unexpected subtexts play more successfully than a feature film which is often cursed by having to be serious drama. Still, I liked Crosby in the lesser known drama Little Boy Lost from this period while I've never been able to sit through The Country Girl, even with William Holden.

I watched it as I watch any and every movie i.e. with the best of intentions and hoping to like more than I dislike. On paper it had plenty going for it beginning with the score. Given that it's a Berlin score we know going in that 1) there will be a healthy slug of his back catalogue melded to a handful of new material and 2) that there's absolutely no danger of us mistaking it for Porter sophistication, Hart wit, Arlen verve and that schmaltz and sentiment will be the order of the day. That's fine. No one's trying to put anything over on us, we know it's going to be The Sound Of Music without the nuns and the kids so let's sit back and let it unspool. Crosby is usually a good bet and when he's teamed with Astaire he's an even better bet. Fred couldn't make it this time around so after trying everyone else they finally settled for Danny Kaye which would also be fine but not, of course, Slyvia Fine, with whose words and music he is most comfortable. It was probably asking too much to expect Kaye to play it straight so we keep getting the Kays schtick whether we like it or not. Rosemary Clooney is adequate as one of the female leads but Vera Ellen has never quite convinced as leading lady material and nor does she here. For acting we have Dean Jagger who is so good he tends to overbalance things. Pleasant? Sure. Engaging? Well ... Painless? More or less.

The love interest is provided by Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney.I've seen this multiple times (once in a brand new print at a repertory theatre)--and I've never really liked it. It starts off great with Crosby singing the title song to soldiers during WWII--that scene really works and is quietly powerful--but then the film falls to pieces. The script is--to be nice--pretty terrible with a totally predictable plot and tired comedy. None of the actors are given roles to play. Kaye seems lost and Clooney and Ellen try to inject life into their characters. Jagger is also far too mild-mannered to play a tough Army general. Only Crosby with his easy-going charm and Mary Wickes (with the few funny lines) really pull off any acting. The songs are pretty unmemorable--What Can You Do With a General has got to be one of the all time worst songs I've heard in a movie. All the sets look impressive--but they're very obviously sets--especially the outdoor ones. And there's no snow or anything Christmas-like until the last 5 minutes! This film does have its good points. It was the first film shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process) and the movie takes full advantage of it with a few elaborate production numbers in bright beautiful Technicolor. Also Kaye and Crosby do have a funny number in drag (sort of) and the beautiful, bright color and some interesting costumes keep you mildly interested. All the singing is good and some of the dancing is just incredible (especially with Ellen).But all in all this is too long (a half hour could have been chopped off), too slow and too badly written for me to like it.

Other than the ending, there just isn't much holiday atmosphere to be found. Secondly, every five minutes another song or dance routine is thrown into the mix. With SO much music, it's only logical that there's gonna be some padding and this flick is loaded with lousy songs... What Do You Do With A General, Sisters, Gee I Wish I Was Back in the Army. Ugh. The only worse piece of work by Irving Berlin was Mr. President in 1962 and that was truly horrid.Then there is the right-wing, militaristic theme we see everywhere in this picture. Sure, you can't avoid it with a plot device like a retired general, but the flag waving would make even Fox News fans want to hurl red, white and blue.Other things about this picture are disturbing... Vera Ellen's high neck-wear (to hide tell-tale signs of her bulimia) and her emaciated waist and legs, the ridiculous romance between a young and pretty Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby who was well into his 50's by this point. Bing's absurd hep-cat language. It's as if we're just supposed to ignore all this stuff because it's a big budget, technicolor songfest by happy, shiny people. Look at Bing's reaction shots and he looks like he's about to fall asleep. And watch him at the end of the film. He looks like a retired clown in that red outfit.There ARE some bright spots. The title track is one of the best holiday songs ever and Bing acquits himself well. The dance sequence with Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen is done very well and Kaye doesn't get his due in this picture. But these things just can't make up for a movie that wants you to suspend disbelief, but can't pull it off. Once something gets rolling, the next three scenes fall far short. I cringe when I see Bing talking to his old army buddies about how great things were in the war, it's just so fake. No infantry man in the history of the planet ever walked, talked or felt that way about the hell of combat. Then there's Dean Jagger's haggard, old General routine, always falling into military jargon that sounds false and hollow. The way the old troops cozy up to him at the end of the picture is nauseating - not because there's anything wrong with those patriotic feelings, but because the script can't pull it off.This movie just doesn't gel and you're really pulling for it to do so, but it just never comes. Star power alone isn't enough to make it work because this movie believes in its own falsehoods. It really DOES think its a great, classic musical. It really DOES think its funny and it really DOES believe that WE will believe the convoluted plot devices, laughable romantic scenes and terrible dance routines with Crosby-Kaye. Really? We're supposed to believe that a vaudeville team is the hottest act in show biz in the mid 50's? Elvis, Chuck Berry, Martin and Lewis and Little Richard might beg to differ. Look, really LOOK at how un-entertaining the showbiz schtick really is. Bing and Danny don't really entertain much at all. Why this horrible movie is a classic is beyond me. I guess it's because it's supposed to be. Not enough for me though.

"},{"Title":"another Holiday Inn...NOT...","Date":"14 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":"  If it weren't for a few good song-and-dance routines, some great looking scenes at a Vermont lodge, and the fabulous Rosemary Clooney delivering some real professional song numbers, 'White Christmas' would be a forgettable, routine bit of Holiday fare.The trouble is--even though everything is all prettied up in technicolor and the cast includes four pros like Danny Kaye, Bing Crosby, Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney, there is an artificial flavor to the sugary script--as well as a weak performance by Danny Kaye who is usually so non-stop great.When the Irving Berlin numbers take center stage everything is all right--but the minute they're over we're stuck with the dreary plot that begins in a highly artificial stagebound set supposed to be a war zone and ends in an equally artificial and artless manner when a barn door is opened to reveal the fake snow of a Vermont winter while our stars wear their Santa caps and do a reprise of the title song. It's all so obviously contrived and manipulated to bring tears in celebration of a plot to have the retired General and proprietor of the lodge (Dean Jagger) honored by fellow servicemen. Too much false sentiment cannot dim the charm of some of the song numbers, however. The film's greatest strength are the Berlin tunes sprinkled throughout Count Your Blessings, The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing, Sisters, and a wonderful torch number performed to the hilt by Rosemary Clooney (the title of which escapes me at the moment!)The most surprising moment of the film occurs when Vera-Ellen and Danny Kaye dance gracefully to The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing, the kind of number one would expect Fred Astaire to do with such ease. But Kaye is exceptionally talented here, matching the professional moves of Vera-Ellen with verve and fine form. It's too bad the rest of his performance lacks his customary comic flair, except for the in drag routine, Sisters, performed with an uncomfortable looking Bing Crosby.Way below the standards one expects from a film directed by the great Michael Curtiz. It sure has a handsome look to it in technicolor--but except for a few good Berlin tunes, the story is as phony as the artificial snow the size of tennis balls that falls at the finale.

Michael Curtiz was never a great director in the way Hitchcock or Hawks were - he never stamped his own mark on the material he was given.  But he was an inventive craftsman, always prepared to enliven and sometimes deepen the most generic of subjects with pace, good humour, an inherent sense of drama and elegantly complex camerawork.  The hothouse intensity of MILDRED PIERCE seemed to exhaust him, and after a decade of brilliance, which included THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD and CASABLANCA, he settled down to untiring hackwork, which, while easy on the eye, was indifferent to inspiration or interest.WHITE CHRISTMAS is better than most, its predictability and dubious ideology made palatable by likeable leads, the title song, and a plot with a degree of complication.  The opening sequence is a bit of a pleasant surprise.  In the middle of of a shell-shocked wilderness during World War Two, Captain Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Private Davis (Danny Kaye) are entertaining the troops with energetic, Christmas Eve vaudeville on a makeshift stage.  A group of senior officers drive up; the incoming general deplores the lack of discipline and demands that the soldiers are prepared for inspection.  The outgoing general Waverly (Dean Jagger), a soft-hearted grouch, gives him wrong directions to extend the show a little bit, and after some manly sentimentality, Bing sings 'White Christmas'.  The straining for pathos is obvious, objectionable and irresistable.  Later, during a bombing, Davis accidentally saves Wallace's life.  The latter is a famous singer in real life; Davis calls in the favour so that they become a double act.The war over, Wallace and Davis become a huge success, first as performers, than writers, than producers.  Immensely rich, but lonely, Davis keeps trying to set Wallace up with bimbos.  Tricked into watching a sister double act, Betty and Judy Haynes (Rosemary 'aunt of George' Clooney and Vera-Ellen), the pair become smitten, and an extended double romantic plot ensues, with all the usual, enjoyable twists and turns.  This is bound up with a putting-on-a-show plot, when our heroes try to help Waverly, who has bought a snowlodge in a Vermont that stubbornly refuses to snow.It would take a more cynical viewer than me to reject this cosy fun.  There is something very traditional, almost Shakespearean about the film, in which plot and incident are subordinated to the celebrating of the titular feast day.  In this way, WHITE is less a narrative than a pageant, in which difference and difficulty are set up only to be ironed away in a finale of reconciliation.  It is a strangely secular pageant though; spirituality or the birth of Christ don't get a look in - this film, as much as Coca Cola, embodies the very American dereligioning (sic?) of this most fundamentally religious of festivals.There is much that is difficult in this.  It IS a very white, exclusionary Christmas, that only has room for the talented, beautiful, rich, heterosexual (even if Bing and Danny go ill-advisedly drag) and white.  This is only to be expected in a Hollywood film of the 1950s, and WHITE is a highly revealing marker of American ideology of the era, and, through nostalgia, our own.  What is worse is that this is all underpinned by a celebration of the military, which is hard not to see as a sycophantic tribute to President Eisenhower.  Early on, Wallace joked that it would be impossible to find a Democrat in Vermont - this had seemed like mild satire; by the end of the film, it's a relief.  The militarism isn't scary a la Riefenstahl; the soldiers are regular Joes, shabby, jokey.  In WHITE's penultimate number, the easy-going army life is favourably compared to the vicissitudes of real life, but this only normalises and makes acceptable the uncriticised adoration of the military that the plot crises work towards.  In the same way, the seeming criticism of capitalism in Wallace and Davis' unselfish deeds only serves to vindicate it.  Only capitalism can afford to be philantropic enough to achieve the selflessness it does.As a musical, the film is a complete failure.  Its critique of the American need for performance to conceal reality is half-hearted, while it admits that its own power as a genre has been much diminished by the emergence of television, which, strange for a 50s film, is not an object of fear.  WHITE  is little more than an excuse to string together some Irving Berlin numbers, few of which are very memorable, and many of which sound like advertising jingles.  Curtiz directed one great musical - YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, a model of vibrant invention - but is completely lost here.  Although made at Paramount, WHITE bears all the marks of a Fox musical - vulgar sets; flat compositions; dull rendering of movement; the substitution of noise and clutter for originality and style.  MGM were the only studio in the 1950s who could make musicals - Minnelli used sets and colour to create emotional depth; Donen had a way of pulling off the most elaborate sequences with clarity and truth; Gene Kelly burst forth with vigour and ideas.  A second-rate MGM musical puts everything here to shame - all the big dance numbers are lumbering because Curtiz does not know how to film them.  The two male leads are fine Crosby has an inoffensive croon that puts you at ease, even if you'd never listen to it as MUSIC; he is a relaxed comedian in whose company you don't mind spending a couple of hours.  At the risk of losing my cool, I have always adored Danny Kaye, his physicality, his facial movements, his voice and vocal gymnastics, his versatility.  He is totally wasted here - the one or two sequences (eg the fall down the stairs) showing what might have been.  The girls are bores, but could it be any other way.  I watched this on Christmas Day after dinner and it was perfect.  I don't think I could have swallowed Tarkovsky.

Among my rude comments this time were You don't think I'm repulsive, do you? - Not next to Bob Dole you aren't.(while the old woman is handing out glasses of champagne) Champagne? - Yes it is.(at the train station) Betty left this for you. - Dear Judy, an alligator bit off my head.As for the sign telling people not to leave cigarette butts and ashes lying around, you just have to blur the scene a little bit to make it say butts and asses. That's an immature thing to do, you say? Well, White Christmas is a pretty immature movie.As for that comment about Stephen Colbert. When a remake of the horror classic Black Christmas (considered by many people to be the very first slasher) got released a few years ago, he asserted that it ripped off this movie. In his right-wing commentator persona, he declared something like, if anyone's going to get chased by a psycho killer, it should be Rosemary Clooney. I wonder, would it have swayed his opinion either way to remind him that Rosemary Clooney's nephew stars in movies like Syriana? I should say, however, that George Clooney had a fine-looking aunt.What I mean - as a joke, natch - about carousels taking over is this. A few days ago, I saw the 1956 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel (which I heckled). The next day, I saw Carosello napoletano (Neapolitan Carousel in English, it was one of Sophia Loren's early movies). Finally, this movie contains numerous references to carousels. Next might there be a movie in which carousels come to life and go all Freddy Krueger on everyone? Yes, I admit that this review barely makes any sense. I just like to do this when reviewing these kinds of movies. I don't like Bing Crosby one bit, while I consider Danny Kaye a genius. But a really cool Christmas movie that I recently saw is Silent Night, Deadly Night; an appropriate one with Halloween approaching. I also recommend the original Black Christmas. "},{"Title":"D'oh!

No, that's one of many, many problems. But where to begin? How about a boring, insipid plot and script, pretentious and boring, without an ounce of humor or cleverness.Flat, uninspired characters, written as if the writers had a gun held to their heads to create a plot for these four actors. Yuch.Staging, musical direction, off the sappiness scale of dullness and lack of inventiveness. Kind of a portent of those awful TV variety show specials of the late 1960's. Ugh.Predictable ending? How about sickeningly predictable ending. But then, who cares? If you are still watching this mess to the end you deserve it. And, as much as I love Crosby, Clooney, and Kaye (Vera Ellen doesn't belong on the same planet as these folks, though here it hardly matters) I can't give this film more than a two, and that's a stretch.For the people who luv this film, I'm sorry. To the people who haven't seen it, stay away. This is not what classic Hollywood musicals are about.

During the trip, they show a train racing along, in the Orange and Yellow Santa FE (West Coast) colors. A minute or so later they show another train... Silver and blue, then they are seen getting off an old green Pullman car.The girls are occupying the guys sleeper room and every available space on the train is taken... Why then, a few minutes later, are they sleeping in berths along the corridor?When they arrive in Vermont, a red station wagon with a white roof pulls into the station, magically it becomes a tan colored, wood paneled wagon.The movie ok okay, I guess... fantasy fluff... The best part of the movie is Barrie Chase with her lines... Mutual, I'm sure and the Well I like that, not even a kiss my foot or have an apple We roar with laughter every time she opens her mouth. When she dances off with the fat guy, the look on her face is priceless.Mary Wickes is also wonderful in that movie, like everything else she does.Bing Crosby...eeeeeew!!!Danny Kaye...just there for a paycheck and the free buffet.Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney... 2 men in dresses who were the inspiration for a thousand drag queens over the years.Watching R. Clooneys acting made me wonder if she was doing a clinical study for Lithium or Prozac. She was truly awful. That black dress she wore in her Love, you didn't do right by me number was probably a true inspiration to John Waters in designing a dress for Divine.Aside from that... It was a decent flick.

Having heard little about White Christmas other than knowing it is a classic and knowing the Christmas song by Bing Crosby, we eagerly brought this one home.SPOILERS TO FOLLOWWe are both curious as to how a movie can be considered a Christmas classic (and even have a title with 'Christmas' in it) when, of the 120 minute running time, only approximately 7 minutes of actual Christmas events/songs are included.  The other 113 minutes consisted of bad acting, horrific editing and above all... really bad music, singing, dancing etc.I apologize to people who actually love this movie (and there appears to be quite a few!), but please, what exactly was the point of this movie?  Was there a heart warming message?  I guess one can argue the soldiers reuniting to honour the General at the end did attempt to tug at one's heart strings, but what else was there?  It appears to me that whomever approved this project was looking at showcasing Mr. Crosby's 'White Christmas' song.  It is sung at the beginning and end of the movie and as mentioned there is not much in between.I don't mean to disrespect the legends associated with the film.  My wife & I are not fans of musicals and I was aware that the majority of the film would be music & dancing.  The problem here is that it is considered a Christmas movie and I disagree.  I thought that there would be Christmas songs throughout and that just isn't the case.  Sitting through 2 hours of this is my own personal movie Hell.

It's really disappointing when you seek out what you presume to be a holiday film and get something non-festive like this. But I'll tell you something - I was somehow attracted to the young Rosemary Clooney throughout the film (go figure; and heck, there had to be SOMETHING to keep me awake)... but no, this one I'll never want to see again.
