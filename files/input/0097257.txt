[{"Title":"The Jeff & Geena Trilogy","Date":"28 April 2004","Score":"36 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":"  Former real life Hollywood couple Jeff Goldblum & Geena Davis made 3 films together, two of them comedies, one of them serious. The first film, also the film where they met, was the horror movie spoof Transylvania 6-5000 (which I keep looking for but can't seem to find), in which Jeff played a reporter sent to Transylvania to follow a story with partner Ed Begley Jr. and Geena played a sex starved nymph who was convinced she was a vampire. The 2nd one they did and also the only serious one was the 1986 remake of The Fly, in which Jeff played a good natured but lonely mad scientist who turned into a giant fly monster (that looked nothing like a fly and something more like a killer praying mantis) and Geena played his journalist lover. Then after boldly going where no Hollywood couple had ever gone before in said remake of The Fly, they returned to light hearted comedy with our film here Earth Girls Are Easy.I've often theorized that the reason celebrity couples do films together is because it gives them a chance to spend time together and work together (seeing as how the hectic Hollywood schedule tends to keep people apart for long periods of time) and because studios can cash in on the respective fan bases of both stars. Well, for what it's worth this is a hell of a lot more fun to watch than most celebrity couple films.Anyway, in this their third and final film together, Geena plays a beautiful but romantically unhappy manicurist Valley Girl who's doctor boyfriend Ted is cheating on her and Jeff plays the blue furred ringleader of three furry aliens, the other two being yellow furred Damon Wayans and pre-movie stardom red furred Jim Carrey (with his hair dyed blond!). Furry aliens Jeff, Jim and Damon crash land in Geena's pool the day after Geena discovers how unfaithful Ted's been and the sight of them understandably throws her for a loop. With their ship down for repairs the boys will have to stay with Geena and, doing her part for interplanetary relations, takes them to her ditzy manicurist cohort Candy (Julie Brown, who also helped write the film) to give the guys make overs so they can pass for Earthlings. Guess what? Geena eventually falls in love with Captain Jeff.In an unrelated subplot that never quite went anywhere, Julie Brown's character fell for Jim Carrey's alien. Watching this back when it was made, who would have guessed that Jim Carrey would eventually go on to become one of Hollywood's biggest comedic stars and possess a career that would overshadow stars Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis?May not be brilliant comedy but like so many other comedies of the 80s this is still a reasonably funny, good natured romp with the cast making the most of it. Geena's easy to like and Jeff's a good straight man to the wild antics of Jim and Damon, who both appear to be having a good time as the nuttier aliens. I don't know why people keep saying bad things about Jeff's performance here, as his quirky style makes him an ideal alien stranger in a strange land and manages some of the film's best bits, like when he uses his love touch to get two cops stuck on each other. There's also a funny scene where Jeff offers to make love to Geena to make her feel better about herself and get her mind off her cheating boyfriend and she tries to explain that them making love might not work on account of the fact that he's not of the Earth so not everything may work the same way and the whole time he's undressing off camera and then she gets a look at him and his equipment and just sort of trails off. Of course, she has to make sure he doesn't get the impression that Earth Girls Are Easy.Bit of a shame that Jeff & Geena's marriage didn't work out.There are also some funny musical bits.Mac is Mr. Right? - Jeff Goldblum as Mac "},{"Title":"...and so was this movie....","Date":"1 September 2004","Score":"28 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":"  It's cute....  it's bouncy....  it's fluff....  but it's mindless entertainment for a few hours....

No, there's nothing plausible about 90% of the plot, but nor is there any pretense of such, so it's not something worth angsting over. Three fuzzy, colorful aliens crash their little yellow ship into the pool of a young, somewhat vapid Geena Davis, who has recently discovered that her MD. fiance is cheating on her. A quick shave and styling at her friend's beauty parlor transforms the three into less hirsute versions of Goldblum, Carrey and Wayans. Having assimilated at least the appearance of human beings, the aliens enter the world of 80s California, and wackiness, along with the necessary romance, ensues.As 80s flicks go, this is better than, say, Weird Science or Back to School, though not up to par with things like Caddyshack or A Fish Called Wanda. Nothing essential to go out of your way to see, but certainly worth catching sometime  "},{"Title":"A joyous romp - fluff, but Really Good Fluff!","Date":"6 July 2007","Score":"20 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" Sadly a few jaded commentators (including the late redoubtable Halliwell) seen to have taken this movie far too seriously...pay no attention! This movie mas made as a zany fluffy comedy, and it succeeds admirably at it. With talents like Gina Davis, Geoff Goldblum, the young Jim Carrey and the multi-talented Julie Brown amongst others how could it fail? Memorable moments include the aliens' learning isolated English phrases from commercials and old movies - limp and hard to manage has become a family in-joke; the like,-totally-cool-to-whatever-outrageous-happens surfer Woody (Michael McKean); the makeover; and Julie Brown's song, now a classic on Dr Demento, Because I'm Blonde.For anyone who complains the special effects are cheesy - they're _meant_ to be! This is in part a spoof of the 1950's aliens-come-to-earth B movies, so watch closely when the space ship arrives, hovers over the trees, and does its forced landing in Davis' pool it is a triumph of reproducing the authentic 1950's effect, not a poor attempt at 80's FX tech! All in all the production values, cinematography and direction are excellent throughout and support the fine cast and writers to produce one of the most delightful light comedies of the 80's.Don't miss this charmer. See it when it comes around on TV. Rent it, or buy it and show all your friends. Just be sure you're in the mood for comic nonsense, not Dostoyevsky!

Story At 11.","Date":"11 July 2004","Score":"14 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":"  'Earth Girls are Easy' is a B-52's kind of style musical. Well, it's sort of a musical. It's sporadic musical numbers and dance acts that have to keep this movie plugging along. If you know the Julie Brown song, Earth Girls are Easy, then you know the story. Clueless Valerie (Geena Davis) of the Valley discovers that her idiot fiancee, Ted (Charles Rocket), is cheating on her about the same time that some aliens crash land in her swimming pool. With Ted gone, she doesn't mind entertaining a few aliens (Jim Carey, Damon Wayans, and Jeff Godlbum) for a while. Actually, the results are pretty funny, since basically she tries to get them to assimilate to 80 Californian culture as she knows it. She first does by shaving off their hairy exterior so that they look like humans (of course). It sure doesn't occur to their blonde, braindead Valley Girl friends, that there is something wrong Wiploc, Zeebo, and Mac (especially considering that they repeat everything people tell them and don't say much else) so long as theyre good dancers, party animals, and good in bed, of course. In the course of everything, including her creepy fiancee trying to weasel his way back, Valerie falls in love with Mac (played by her then-husband, Jeff Goldbum). It is an amusing little romantic comedy that seems to have taken some cues from Susan Sneideman's 'Making Mr. Right' which you might also enjoy if you like this movie, although that is not quite as funky in the B-52s sense of the word. Not that the B-52s had anything to do with this movie, either, but I think they are most closely associated with the style of comedy and atmosphere I'm referring to.This is not a movie for everyone, obviously. Earth Girls are Easy is a funky 80s b-comedy recommended for real 80s fans, though it'll probably appeal more to us female audiences. Just waste your brain, wax your board, and pray for waves!

Now the arrival of the three extra-terrestrials will change Valerie's life forever.As a sci-fi comedy, some occasional singing scenes make this film also fit the category of musical. Although this is not exactly a profound story, it is light-hearted, colorful, energetic and successfully made for the purpose of entertainment.The whole film is a hilarious party, if you're in the mood to relax, to lay back and to kick off your shoes without wanting to explore some serious issue, then you'll have a grand time watching this. The scene Valerie destroys about everything in her house after she sees her fiance with another woman was skillfully filmed and acted in a very funny and original way, while Valerie sings I've lost my faith in you.As Valerie, Geena Davis beautifully portrayed this cheerful, optimistic, lively and strong woman. Jeff Goldblum played Mac, a charming, maturer, steadier alien while his fellow travelers Wiploc and Zeebo (played by Jim Carrey and Damon Wayens respectively) are wackier and more fun-loving. All the characters in this movie are likeable and the film itself is just as interesting.

Their efforts to get laid are punctuated by the humorous pop songs of Julie Brown (of I Like Them Big and Stupid fame).One look at the cast, and you know this is going to be good comedy. Jeff Goldblum was a big star when this film was made, but Jim Carey and Damon Wayans steal the show as hormone-stoked space guidos (they were both unknowns at the time).

She's a riot and her songs are great. Music video director Julien Temple maintains a brisk pace throughout. This is a colorful, bubbly comedy that I think will appeal to a variety of viewers.

There, sexy salon co-worker Julie Brown (as Candy Pink) gives the men a make-over. They look normal, but still act funny. Davis is attracted to Mr. Goldblum, but doesn't want aliens to think Earth Girls Are Easy. Ms. Brown thinks Mr. Carrey's long tongue looks fun and Mr. Wayans' dancing stunt double gets a work-out. This hilarious film is one of the best-written comedies about American pop culture - with an emphasis on the 1980s. Brown with co-writers Charlie Coffey and Terrence E.

The songs are well written and genuinely funny, the comic pacing is nicely zippy and the situation could hardly have more camp appeal, combining space aliens, makeovers and Valley culture into a goofy, fun mix. The look of the picture is a major plus, with everything having a sparkly quality to it, and the slightly goofy 50s appearance of the spaceship is a definite plus. Geena and Jeff are an attractive, easy to like couple, and carry off the fairly absurd premise (a whirlwind interspecies romance) disarmingly. One major weakness with the picture is an inability to find screen business for Jim Carrey, who has a few fine moments, but his unique gifts for mimicry and physical comedy are largely wasted.

It's always popular with customers who enjoy watching it as they browse, comment on how young Jim Carrey looks, and ask What on earth is this? as they get to the checkout counter. That's because its such a great looking film. The vibrant color palette with its bright primaries and 80s rehash of 1950s aesthetics is inspired production design.

She was beautiful and cute at the same time and funny, with a tall hot body. Why did she just sort of vanish????When I re-saw this film I could see why it wasn't a hit. It's a bit too loose and wacky. The direction by Julian Temple is too slack many of the jokes just misfire and go past unnoticed because the staging is bad. He seemed to have taken just one take of each shot. The musical parts are badly put together and the music (which I still love) pretty weak.

I'm an Earth Girls addict, without a doubt, and you'll become one too, after viewing it at least 3 times.

Its ours when we watch it and can take these things on any terms we desire. If you are like me, and take Barbarella not seriously, but as something important, you will do the same here.Its not quite in the category I follow of filmmakers directing their lover, but its close, as we know these two are lovers in real life.It asks a lot of the viewer, to believe the story, what with the props and costumes. But its precisely the same degree the characters on the screen are asked to believe about each other and the nature of love.

I just saw it again, and it is getting better all the time. You really need to see it twenty or thirty times to catch all the brilliant jokes and one-liners, as they fly so thick and fast. Who was crazier, Julie Brown the writer or Julien Temple the director? Probably both. This is the most wacko comedy you can imagine, probably the most anarchic thing since 'A Night at the Opera'. The reason the film works so perfectly is because Geena Davis was the only actress who was absolutely made for the part. She slipped into it like 'something a little more comfortable'. When Geena Davis was born, they wrote in invisible ink on her forehead 'This is the one for the aliens.' She didn't even have to be abducted, they came to her. There they are, sitting around her house and her pool in L.A., talking backwards and eating the fish out of her fish tank. Geena plays Valerie, who is really bright 'I know Finland. It's the capital of Norway.' This film is so over the top, it's from outer space. Well, what did you expect? Julie Brown is staggering in this film. She is so funny, you need life insurance to watch her. Her songs are stellar, but then so are the aliens, not to mention their starship. 'Cause I'm a Blond' is a classic song. I'd really like to read the lyrics over carefully, as it's one of the funniest songs ever written, performed with enough gusto to bust the lens. The humour of this film is so broad, it slides off the sides of the screen. Hilarity Incorporated, that's what it is. They had to be crazy to make this, we know we're crazy to love it. Let's hope that when the aliens finally do come (I mean the other ones, who aren't here yet), they watch this movie to learn how to act towards us. They could do worse than go to Geena's house for some sushi. After all, her main concern is that the aliens won't 'think Earth girls are easy'. No problem. You should see the girls on Venus.

A good woman is hard to find. So much so that even aliens from outer space travel the galaxy to find them. Our three intergalactic space studs crash their spaceship in Geena Davis's swimming pool after catching a glimpse of her sunbathing. Our three furry friends can't party in the valley while looking like oversized stuffed animals. So they get haircuts and California makeovers that drive the ladies of the 80's wild. Our three extraterrestrial superhunks are Jeff Goldbloom, Damon Wayans and Jim Carrey. Geena Davis is not without her problems. She is about to marry a doctor that is more interested in playing doctor with nurses that look half as good as she does. She soon finds that Mr Right is from another planet. Earth Girls Are Easy is a very over the top, funny and blatantly 80's sci fi comedy. For what it is, it is a good movie and is very amusing, insane and campy entertainment.

You'll be cheating yourself if you don't see it. (I never get tired of seeing it, once every year or so. And it's one of those films I've felt the need to show to all my friends because it's too funny!!!)To those who might be deterred by the bad reviews on this site I think the bad title is probably what led many to avoid the film years ago and what has led many on IMDb to give it bad reviews (I suspect these were knee-jerk feminists who reacted to the title and not the film itself which was written by a woman and is woman-sympathetic). The bad reviews are terribly unfair and not in line with the cutting edge comic tour de force here - lampooning not easy women (about which it really has nothing to do with) but the shallow California scene of its time.And for the feminists who missed the point the FEMALE wins here!!! Get it???It's the male lead who's the bad guy. That's for starters. And any woman who dated a jerk is going to LOVE this movie - because the jerk gets his (I don't think I'm giving anything away here, because the movie is about much more than this). (Yet men like myself won't be offended by this fact; there are, of course, jerks of both sexes and they DESERVE to get theirs!)I have to wonder whether those who gave this movie anything less than a very good review actually saw the film or just hated the title. There are some very very funny scenes here - including Julie Brown's Cause I'm a Blonde song vignette, which is hilarious and memorable (and a song you won't ever forget!!!). A very young Jim Carrey is off the charts here, too, yet he's just one of a super-talented cast of heavyweights who score big in this film (his talents as an impressionist especially shine here, for example). You absolutely have to see Michael McKean in his role as the dumb California pool guy and Damon Wayans as Zeebo!!! These are comic performances that are among the very best on film and there are a wealth of vignettes you'll be referring to in conversations for years to come - so many I couldn't list them all here (the doughnut scene, for instance - the mention of which won't give anything away for those who haven't seen this - and the disco scene, which lampoons discos more than any other movie scene ever).Plus, this is heavyweight actor Geena Davis' best comic performance ever - and she's so endearing in this role. I don't think this fine actress has ever been filmed as lovingly or beautifully. Jeff Goldblum (then still her husband), too, puts in a solid job as a romantic lead and even gives realism to an out-of- this-world character (and the love and chemistry between him and Geena is palpable). The only bad thing about this film is the title. And it has NOTHING to do with the film! Yet I think it scared a lot of people away from seeing it. What a shame!!! This is a great comedy - super-inventive and funny and you absolutely have to tune out the bad reviews and see it!

Director Julien Temple doesn't seem to know how to shape individual scenes (such as a frenetic dream sequence) for comedic impact--and he shows no sense of satire (the musical moments are flat).

True, this material does date the movie considerably, but if you are nostalgic for the era you will welcome this material. It also helps that the movie is extremely sunny and upbeat, with likable performances from the cast.The movie is undeniably fun at times, but there is a big flaw that should have been worked on before filming started. The problem is that there is very little story here. The events of the movie unfold very slowly when the pace should have been more snappy and the story more substantial.

Luckily for them he is arrested and that night Mac comforts, and sleeps with, Valerie.

As one can tell from the summary this is not a serious film and that is without having mentioned the frequent musical numbers that occurred during the film. The acting is good enough though and it is clear that everybody involved knew they were making something silly. The special effects are of a fairly low quality although I suspect that was deliberate given the designs of the spaceship.

Gena Davis was very attractive in this one as she was simply gorgeous in the 80's as this is one of two collaborations with her and Jeff Goldblum, The Fly being the other and vastly superior film. This one is about three aliens that crash land in a gal's pool as their ship is really small and they can grow to match the inhabitants and this also saves a lot of money on effects as now you do not have to build a huge spaceship. The aliens start out as really colorful furry types, however once shaved down they look pretty much like humans.

What this strives to be is a colourful, bright and breezy sci-fi comedy with an all-star cast riding high at the peak of their careers. What it turns out to be is a mess of stupid dialogue, dumb comedy situations, and a general lack of cohesion all round.I was hoping this would be a musical along the lines of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, and yet as it turns out the songs are few and far between and seem to have been included just to pad out the running time. Geena Davis is given little more to do than parade around in either her underwear, her nightdress, or a bikini, and even though she looks great this film hardly stretches her acting abilities. She plays a frustrated housewife who embarks on an odd adventure when a spaceship containing three aliens crash-lands in her swimming pool.Jeff Goldblum plays the lead alien and is probably the best actor in this, adding some of his kooky charm, even though he isn't given much to work with all things considered. A pre-fame Jim Carrey plays another of the aliens and is irritating as ever, making weird noises and doing stupid stuff all the while, like an overactive child. The special effects are adequate, but there's no real content here, no lessons learned. The whole film is just an example of '80s excess at its worst.

The Fly is a movie with very dark themes, but Earth Girls are Easy is a very light-hearted comedy with a few songs in it.The ridiculous plot centers around three furry aliens who land in Davis's swimming pool, and subsequently get a makeover so that they look just like humans. They soon turn out to be well-behaved and nice and go on to charm everyone, including Davis.The acting is over-the-top, Davis especially delivers a terrible performance, and Jim Carrey does no better in an early role. However, the movie is colorful and charming, and its cheesy 80s soundtrack ensures it has a cult following.Decent entertainment, but by no means a good movie.

Catching her boyfriend at home playing with a nurse, the disgruntled Valerie gets the surprise of her life when a spaceship crash lands in her swimming pool. The spaceship's crew (played by Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans), haven't had any shore leave in a long time. Not wanting to cause too much of a stir, Valerie takes the alien trio to her best friend Candy (played by Julie Brown) who owns a beauty salon. After Candy transforms the furry trio into believable human males, Valerie finds their captain, Mac (Jeff Goldblum), very attractive. Wild things happen when the alien trio are taken to a dance club and letting them drive in California traffic! The fact that this film is also a musical only adds to the humor as there are several original songs by Julie Brown!If you enjoy remembering the excesses of the 1980's and New Wave music, you will probably enjoy this film!

Although I have a great respect for eye candy where it is used effectively, many of us need only think back to the unending sequence of films from the Confessions, Porky's, Spring Break and similar stables to be thankful that this phase was not prolonged into the nineties. EGAE probably deserves respect as one of the films which, I assume deliberately, helped the industry to turn their eyes to other things than just candy. Other than this it would be hard to respect it for very much today, but it is still easy to enjoy it on its own terms as a totally zany romantic comedy with a story in which anything goes. It also claims credit as a work of sci-fi and as a musical - both of these claims are pure baloney. Today it is hard to find many moviegoers who regards it as more than a historical anachronism, and a plain bad film. But a significant proportion of these same moviegoers would rate it as an enjoyable film that they would be prepared to watch again. Its creators would probably be very happy with this consensus, they were not attempting to create a future classic - only to create a comedy which would succeed when it was released and would give them a great deal of fun whilst making it. We can still share much of this fun today!

It has a PG rating, though the whole movie is basically about hooking up with alien guys. There's also scenes of adultery, some sexual nudity, and references to drug use. This movie makes women seem like adult little girls who don't know what they want and allow people to use them. It makes men look like shallow sex addicts who care about nothing else. I was a little insulted that they would expect me to suspend my disbelief when they took the aliens to a salon and made them look just like attractive beach guys, I mean come on. There are also random song and dance numbers thrown in the midst of this romantic slapstick comedy love story thing. This is definitely NOT for kids, and seems really vapid and immature for adults. I didn't like any of the characters either, which made this movie feel lifeless and uninspired. "}{"Title":"Wears out its welcome","Date":"21 March 2004","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":"  I understood that it was meant to be a campy, B-rate hybrid between comedy, sci-fi, musical and romance and it starts out well.  I liked the opening musical numbers, and there are even some laughs to start out with, like in the scene where Geena Davis tries to spice up her sex life with her fiance.  But after a while, the movie wears out its welcome and gets too campy for its own good.  I'm able to suspend the disbelief of the aliens having their hairy bodies shaved and appearing human--it's a quite creative idea--but I wasn't able to forgive other goofy plot holes, like the aliens landing on earth with no knowledge of the English vocabulary and imitating the lines they hear from movies and TV shows, and in no time they speak the language fluently.  I love the fish-out-of-water idea of aliens appearing as humans and walking the earth, because it's a premise that can go quite far, as we've seen in the sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun.  What makes the idea so funny is that the fact that no matter how different they act than the average human being, the people around them simply think they're stupid humans rather than aliens.  And it's a believable paradox, since a minority of people believe that aliens exist and an even smaller minority believe that they walk the earth in the form of humans.  Once the movie arrives around the 1/2-hour mark, we're faced with flat sight gags and horrible cliches.  However, I did enjoy Julie Brown's musical number, 'Cause I'm a Blonde.  I still cannot get the song out of my head, and I'm faintly humming it at this moment.  Geena Davis is a fine actress, who I don't see much of anymore, not to mention she's very beautiful.  She helps boost the film's merit a couple notches.  Jeff Goldblum looks like he walked onto the wrong movie set.  I don't think I've ever seen him look more bored in a performance.  Maybe he just wanted to re-team with Davis, after having worked together in The Fly.  Earth Girls Are Easy definitely has its fun moments, but after a while that fun dissolves into sheer stupidity.

The whole story is just a joke, I really wanted to enjoy it, but it was just too over the top for me to get. I don't know, maybe if I were younger, but it just seemed to silly to really get and laugh at. But I admit, I did laugh a couple times and it seemed like the cast enjoyed working together. But I'm still in awe of why Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis were married. Doesn't that seem like the weirdest couple? D They just don't match in my vision of what a good couple looks like.It's an incredibly dated movie. But you have a baby Jim Carrey, who would've thought he's come this far? If you could go back in time and tell people that he was going to become a huge and popular actor, they'd probably laugh in your face. Basically Jeff, Jim, and Damon play these three aliens who crash down into Geena's backyard pool by accident, Geena promises to get the pool drained but it can't be fully dry until the next day, so she must find a way of getting these aliens to be like humans while trying to mend her broken heart of a very bad relationship. But Jeff knows a good way of putting her heart back together. D Jim and Damon just have a good time in town and the beach figuring while they're on Earth, they might as well check out the babes! Anyways, while it gets a few laughs and you have some fun with it, it just gets a little stupid and cliché. But if you enjoyed this movie, I'd recommend Encino Man probably. It had that feeling to it, so I'm going to be nice with the rating. It's just a silly musical I think if you are in the right mood, you can enjoy. So, sit back with the popcorn... or not, and go on a ride with Geena and Jeff. To their planet, where people found them to be a cute couple.3/10 "},{"Title":"This movie will change your life","Date":"27 January 2009","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" This is probably the greatest movie I have ever seen. Intelligent, profound, anachronistic, this is the kind of timeless classic that defines a generation and lets us know, as human beings, where exactly we are in the universe. Not only that, but the bright neon colors and happy noises amuse my little brother, who unfortunately has an IQ of 70. Julie Brown should have won an Emmy, a Grammy, a Tony, an Oscar, and a Peabody for her performance. What I like about this movie is that it is not dated at all. Big hair, late 1980s music, and Geena Davis are always in style, no matter if its the 1790s or the 2050s. The only thing that troubles me is, if Geena Davis is so smart, how come she can't pick good movies to be in anymore?

The cartoonish appearance of the aliens and the laughable fact that they have a human appearance once their pastel fur is shaved off is a joke. This film as a whole is boring and immediately forgettable.Given the fact that alien beings, if they do exist, could be in virtually ANY form (and almost definitely not a humanoid form), I find it difficult to believe that the aliens in this movie were nothing but hairy humans. At some points their mentalities seem infantile as they vainly try to assimilate into the human lifestyle, and then you have to acknowledge the fact that they were able to learn the English language in its entirety in a matter of hours. One of them even becomes romantically involved with Valerie (Geena Davis), and seems to know all of the problems that arise in romantic relationships. I can't stand movies like this!A valley girl in California is sunbathing in her yard when a spaceship crash-lands in her swimming pool. That's another thing, by the way; a spaceship capable of interstellar travel and yet small enough to fit in a swimming pool? These guys should have tried to get jobs designing compact cars. A bunch of hairy aliens emerge from this little bitty ship, and Valerie becomes friends with them. She and her friend CANDY (as respectable a name as any) decide to shave them and find that they all resemble mediocre (at the time, at least) Hollywood actors. Their adventures into the world of Southern California provide for a couple of uncertain and unconvincing laughs, yet mostly serve to bore and annoy. Have you so far heard any reason to watch this film? That's because there is none. To make matters worse, the film was partially a musical. I don't have anything against musicals, but it was bad enough that the aliens figured out the human race in a matter of a day or two, now we are asked to believe that they like to sing and dance on the beach. Besides that, some of the songs seem to have been thrown in for no apparent reason (Because I'm blonde comes immediately to mind). Maybe I am being too harsh on this film, but I watched it mostly because I had never seen it and I am a huge Jim Carrey fan, and I was just hugely disappointed. The target audience for Earth Girls Are Easy is incredibly immature, so if you are out of elementary school, I would suggest that you avoid this one.
