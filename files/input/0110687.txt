[{"Title":"I Confess To Seeing This Movie In Theaters As a Child . . . Twice","Date":"12 May 2010","Score":"40 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" I just thought I would get that confession out of the way and into the open. Yes, I went to see this in theaters twice when I was 11 years old. I could list to you the excuses I have, such as the fact that my parents paid for my ticket, and there were only six theaters in my local multiplex at the time, and I had already seen Forrest Gump. I could go on. The truth is that when I first saw a matinée showing of this film with a friend, neither of us thought it was a bad movie. Then I went to see another matinée showing a few days later on a rainy day with my brother and a babysitter, and they both hated the film. Not disliked, mind you, but hated it. They weren't the only ones. In the sixteen years since the film's release, I have heard nothing but bad things about it. It was released on VHS once, never on DVD, and Roger Ebert's review (I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it) is now more famous than the movie itself.As a kid, I knew North wasn't a perfect film. In fact, its major flaw was (and still is) the major cop-out (and frankly lazy) ending that I won't give away. However, I thought it was enjoyable enough, it had a creative (but highly unrealistic) premise, and I liked (and still like) Elijah Wood. Before seeing the movie again after so many years, I wonder what I missed about it in the first place that other people didn't. After seeing it as a 27 year old, I wonder how I could have missed these things to begin with.I think what disappointed people the most about this movie was the fact that it had an all-star cast, a likable lead, an accomplished director (Rob Reiner) who had not directed a bad film before this one, and was based on a book written by Alan Zweibel, one of the original Saturday Night Live writers (who also wrote the screenplay). I haven't read that book, but the idea of a child leaving his parents is more sad than funny.Wood plays a child named North who is a stellar student, athlete, and actor, yet he is worried that his parents don't pay enough attention to him simply because they ignore him while arguing one night at the dinner table. His successful legal divorce from his parents causes a contrived media circus resulting in kids having control over their parents. Such a revolution is spearheaded by North's acquaintance Winchell (Matthew McCurley), a journalist for his school's newspaper who reminded me then of Stuart Minkus from Boy Meets World but now reminds me of Dick Cheney. In an even more contrived circumstance, Winchell becomes head of a major corporation, and plots to kill North when he decides to return to his original parents.Throughout the film, North goes around the world searching for better parents. He stays with various sets of adoptive parents. They include a couple in Texas (Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire) who dress like cowboys you find at the Ice Capades, Alaskans (Graham Greene and Kathy Bates) who send their elderly father (Abe Vigoda) out to sea to die in an archaic ritual that hasn't been practiced in 150 years, and Hawaiian parents who are all too eager to show North's rear end on a highway billboard. It makes me sick writing about these jokes, so you can imagine what it's like to watch it.Seeing this as a kid, I never took these plot points seriously, perhaps because I never thought about divorcing my parents. Seeing it again as an adult, here's what I missed that was so bad about the movie the awful ethnic stereotyping that came in the form of tasteless one-liners and myopic character depictions. The worst came in the form of Kathy Bates putting on a blackface equivalent to play an Eskimo. I cringe now at the terrible joke made by the Hawaiian Governor Ho (Keone Young) about his wife (Lauren Tom) and her inability to procreate Hawaii is a lush and fertile land. In fact, there is only one barren spot on all of our islands. Unfortunately, it's Mrs. Ho.. If I were Mrs. Ho, I would have kicked him in the balls.We've all done foolish things as children. My foolish thing was the 12 dollars that went to waste from seeing this movie twice (although they were both matinees, so I saved some money). The important thing is that I know better now, and I reviewed this film recently before writing this review. This rule should apply to every amateur critic on this site the way you remember movies you saw years ago is not the same as the way these movies actually are.Siskel & Ebert declared North the worst movie of 1994, and looking back, their reasoning was good. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? No. Worse movies came out in 1994 (It's Pat The Movie and Exit To Eden come especially to mind), and any movie written or directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer make North look like Citizen Kane, and I doubt Ebert would disagree. However, there's no question that there's only one barren spot in Rob Reiner's directing career. Unfortunately, it's this movie.

This is painfully stupid, unbelievably offensive and never actually funny.

I'm not sure I'd say that Elijah was one of them at this point, but then again, all the child performers in this are annoying. There is brief moderately strong language in this. The DVD has a trailer and about about ten minutes worth of interviews with the director and cast. I recommend... well, not this, not for anyone.

If you are, DO NOT see the movie.  All the language here is taken directly from the movie.Roger Ebert hated, hated, hated this movie, and while I wouldn't go as far as to say that, this certainly ranks as the worst (by far) Elijah Wood movie on record.  The quality of such an actor as Wood or Bruce Willis can't overcome the fact that North has absolutely no idea what kind of movie it wants to be.At first glance, North seems to be a kids movie.  The plot, in which the title character searches for the ideal parents, is a child's dream.  The main characters (except Willis' guardian angel role) are either kids or stupid.  The message is a simple one about what constitutes a true family, and only a child would be unable to determine the exact outcome within the first thirty minutes of the film.  North feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon.But do kids movies have sex jokes?  Do kids movies talk about men having blood in their stool or boys balls sticking to their legs in hot weather? Do kids movies have children utter words like asshole?  Do kids movies have the main character apparently get shot in the head?  It's one thing to have elements that will appeal to adults, but those elements shouldn't force parents to cover their kids' ears.North is a bad movie.  Parents (and everyone else) be warned.Grade D-  (a few good jokes and the always lovable Wood, but this is a movie that never should have been made) "},{"Title":"A Monty Pythonish-style social satire the US couldn't take.","Date":"19 March 2002","Score":"22 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" This is the closest Hollywood has come to doing a Monty Pythonish spin of American society (at least until the SOUTH PARK movie); but unfortunately it was made at the time when America took itself far too seriously and was too priggish to handle satirical jabs; especially compared to British, Australian or Canadian societies. It took the success of animated TV series like The Simpsons and South Park in order to get America to lighten up about itself. (It is very telling that most American critics enjoyed the poke at French society, yet couldn't stomach anything closer to home. It is also interesting that the only classic US geographic stereotype not included here is hippyish Californians!)The movie isn't without it's faults. The assassination scene in particular feels like a stock Hollywood action scenario that's been tacked on at the end. And the use of a pre-pubescent boy in a provocative advertising commercial is quite tasteless. But most of the time, this consists of well-staged comic set pieces with the tongue-in-cheek feel of a usual stand-up routine. My fav line is So THAT'S why we had to stop 47 time!; which is delivered with zeal - especially in the original theatrical release (you have to see the story to geddit). And it also has in the Texas scene one of the best staged musical numbers in modern American cinema (along with MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING). It is also interesting to compare the fictional critical reaction to North in Fiddler on the Roof to the real-life critical reaction to Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE/A.I.The movie deals with two central concepts. The first is the stock presentation of the young whizz-kid genius common at the time, with the attendant attitude that the World Owes Me a Living. (The prime dramatic example is Wesley Crusher of the TV series Star TrekTNG). The second, related theme is the way that in the 80s and early 90s, Hollywood (and to a lesser extent America generally) tended to think of children almost purely as undersized adults - with the attached responsibilities and privileges. This film isn't the only one to deal with this; other examples include BIG SHOTS, THE LITTLE RASCALS, HOME ALONE 2 & 3 and even the TV series Uncle Buck. Attitudes have changed slightly since; Hollywood's notorious backlash against child actor Macaulay Culkin, and real-life incidents like the young girl who crashed piloting a plane across the US, and the grade-school boy who was suspended for kissing a girl have caused America to re-think the issue somewhat.Prior to this movie was the film IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES starring a young Drew Barrymore; and though it handled a child's divorce case a lot more crassly and tastelessly, it didn't receive nearly half the critical outrage this movie did. Even more amazing; an almost identical storyline was revamped (read ripped off) in the film RUSHMORE; and though it's a lot more pretentious and ponderous in its delivery, the critics lauded it. Apparently having a whizz-kid neurotically stalk a grade-school teacher (among other things) is more critically commendable than having him learn there's no place like home. Go figure!One of the regrettable outcomes of this movie is that talented actor Elijah Wood went from playing broad-ranging all-rounder variety of roles leading up to this film; to playing almost exclusively standard rote grungy drama roles afterwards. I half-suspect he's been put off comic roles for life; and quite frankly I wouldn't blame him - though it seems a crying shame! He showed a great deal of range and personality as a kid; and the Hollywood system squelched it!In summary; this is a flawed, but still widely under-appreciated satire of America's more eccentric social mores; which the American general public (and professional film critics in particular) weren't maturely sophisticated enough to handle.

Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his guardian angel (Bruce Willis).I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping on any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of North, the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could North be? Or more accurately put how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like?Well... North is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the philosophical narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clichés that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where North really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect).Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that North is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life.I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is North the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

Kids don't get out of their homes when their parents are molesting them, beating them, and neglecting them, and North gets out because his parents don't let him run wild like he doesn't have any?  The movie is just lame.  Maybe it's amusing to 10 year olds who think that parents should let them do whatever they want, but the world just isn't like that.  So get over it.

The Easter Bunny, or a man dressed as the Easter Bunny (Bruce Willis) came and sat down beside him. North told him his troubles and they talked a while. The man then left North with his thoughts.       His friend Winchell, the editor of the school news paper, prints a story about North wanting to leave his parents and search for a better pair.

Judge Buckle rules in favor of North, but then adds that he must choose a new set of parents by Labor Day or be put in an orphanage. Soon, North received letters and airline tickets from people all over the world so he set off. First starting in Texas and meets Ma and Pa Tex (Reba McEntire, Dan Aykroud). Life sounds promising, until North finds out his new parents want to fatten him up to make him like their first son, Buck, who was enormously fat and killed in a stampede. North thought it over and decided he didn't want to follow in Buck's enormous footsteps so he leaves and heads to Hawaii and meets his new parents Governor and Mrs. Ho. Life here looks good until North sees a bilboard of himself with an octopus pulling his bathing suit up and down revealing his bare hiniey. North left and headed for Alaska. His new Alaskan parents seemed nice until North learned about Flowing which was an Eskimo ritual in which an elderly Eskimo, who is too old and/or weak to contribute to society, he's placed on an ice float to head out to sea to die. North witnessed his new grandpa (Abe Vigoda) being flowed. He suddenly realized his deadline was drawing very near so he headed to the airport to continue his search.        Back at home, Winchell and Arthur Belt held rallies that helped kids get the best of their parents; North traveled to Japan, France, Africa and Amish Country but they didn't seem like suitable homes. He finally arrived in Bedford, New York and met the Nelsons, Ward, Donna, Bud and Laura. They seemed like a terrific family, but North just didn't feel right with them so he left them. Back home, his real parents have awakened and send North a video tape saying they want him back so North heads home, care of a Fed Ex driver. It seemed this man was following North around the whole time! North ran towards his parents then he suddenly awakened in the mall. It had all been a dream! The Easter Bunny man drove him home. It was that man who seemed to be following North around in his dream. When he get's home, his parents tell him how worried they were about him and it seemed they really did care. North was glad to be home.        I don't know why this movie got such bad reviews. I thought it was a great movie! Great music by Marc Shaiman and good acting by all!

Underneath this facade is a film that like a shark hiding below the surface waiting to strike at unsuspecting victims. I can now see why the late Gene Siskel described this movie as first class junk and trash.North is what can be described as a perfect child and has a perfect life, except in one area his parents (Jason Alexander and Julia Louis- Dreyfus). North feels his parents do not appreciate him or pay him as much attention as they should. We are shown this by his parents not paying attention to him at the dinner table while they are in a heated argument. This one incident leads to him suffering in other areas of his life, including in academics, acting, and sports. North goes to his secret spot where he talks with a man in an Easter Bunny costume (Bruce Willis) and then decides that he will divorce himself from them. With the help of his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz), a Lionel Hutz-esque lawyer who unlike Hutz from The Simpsons is very unlikable and unfunny. The other person who helps him out is his friend Winchell (Matthew McCurley) who with Belt is planning on using North's story to have children take over.North wins the case and travels across the world to places like Texas, Alaska, China, France, and New York, with the stereotypical representations of the people going from seemingly innocent comedy to downright racist and hurtful. North meets an array of parents including Texans (Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire) to a nice New York couple the Nelsons (the late John Ritter and Faith Ford). Along the way, North realizes that what he really wants is to be with his real parents and goes to meet up with them.At the same time, a subplot goes on about the illogical and incomprehensible plan of getting children to take over and put Belt in office. The kids act like evil geniuses while the adults are bumbling buffoons who go along with this or are so frightened by the idea of their kids leaving them that they will bow to their every demand. Their plan, even in the film's universe, is illogical and wouldn't work. Going along with this plan are strangely a number of adults, including a hit man named Al (Robert Costanzo) who is tasked with taking North out so he does not return to his parents. Al lies in wait while North finally reunites with his parents and is shot, only to discover that the film sank to the level of having it's events all be a dream.Another large problem with the movie is the character of North. North wants to divorce himself from his parents because he says they are selfish and only care about themselves and leaves the other possible parents he meets for reasons like they are uncaring like with the set of parents in Alaska (Graham Greene and Kathy Bates) and so on. All of the problems that North finds with his parents and the other potential parents are all with him, too. He thinks the Alaskan parents are uncaring when he just dumped his real parents and he thinks his real parents are selfish while he is an egotistical little brat who thinks he is the greatest thing ever. He leaves his parents claiming their disaffection with him is ruining the rest of his life when it must not have been all bad if it just started taking a toll. Also, all we know is that he wants to leave them after they would not acknowledge him while they were in the middle of an argument at dinner. He is exactly what he hates. This is in no way the fault of Elijah Wood. Wood is a quite talented actor but no actor, no matter how good could pull this role off.The film is littered with talented actors like Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Dan Aykroyd, etc., but none of them manage to save the movie or put in a performance that makes the film bearable, and you can't blame them based on the material they're working with. The humor is unfunny and racist at times, the premise is hurtful and heartless, and the lesson at the end is one we could learn from watching the far better and far more entertaining film The Wizard of Oz.This film is the three H's hateful, heartless, and horrible. Gene Siskel described the movie as first-class junk and claimed it made him feel unclean. He was being too nice. North is a horrible movie that will make you feel horrible inside instead of heart-warmed like you were obviously supposed to be.

He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge.North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque cliché family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home.Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now.I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be.Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

After having seen it for the second time in 10 years, I must agree that I was not as amused as I was the first time.North is a major cheat. In the first half hour it comes up with a pretty nifty premise but then it doesn't have the guts to follow through. It has nothing to do with most of the characters being broad caricatures or the fact that most of them are kind of stupid. (Will there ever be a part for Jon Lovitz where he is not a sniveling toady?) Most of the characters may not be funny, true, but the thing is that after years of seeing parodies like Airplane or Naked Gun, you sort of become very jaded and seeing the little kid, Winchell play dictator isn't as funny as it must have been if the movie came out in the 50's.North is a pretty bad movie one of the reasons comes at the end. It's as if the writer got stuck for an ending and then decided to give up. Watch it and you will know what I'm talking about.Another reason it's bad is because of Bruce Willis. I don't mean because his performance is awful but because he is tremendously not funny, something that is hard to say about him. Hudson Hawk looks like an Oscar caliber performance compared to this. He is flat (probably written that way) but it is his funny costumes that's supposed to carry his comedic weight. At that it bombs.So I hated this movie too, I guess, but it is not the worst movie in history. Elijah Wood is pretty good and individual episodes are quite amusing (Dan Aykroyd as a Texan). It's just that ending I can't stomach.

So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep.

Even though I've never always agreed with them, they are probably my all-time favourite movie critics. These two have blasted some of the worst movies of all time. This includes Kazaam, Batman & Robin, and even Bio-Dome! So when I heard Roger Ebert say this about North I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. I hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it. I had to watch it. Seeing Ebert being so harsh on this movie was so hilariously fascinating! So when I found this movie on Netflix, what did I find?Oh.....GOD!!!! THIS is now officially the worst movie I've ever watched. Mostly because of how cold the characters were, and how insensitive it was to so many different racial stereotypes with such offensive jokes! On top of that, there were even some bad jokes referring to pedophilia! I mean, this was 1994! HOW DID THIS MOVIE EVEN GET MADE???? Oh, and I'm not done yet. The plot seems simple at first, with a boy named North divorcing his parents and travelling around the world to find new ones. No harm in that, right? Well, by the end it gets so needlessly complicated. (SPOILERS....if you care that is) North heads back to New York after realizing that he can't find better parents. (Which is weird, since that family with John Ritter, Faith Ford, Scarlett Johansson and Jesse Zeigler was near- perfect for him! I'm not kidding!) So what's with this plot to assassinate him? Is this really necessary? Also, did they need Bruce Willis to appear in the forms of the Easter bunny, several ancestors from around the world, and hell, even a FedEx driver? It makes you wonder how this movie didn't destroy his film career. One more thing I need to talk about, and that's the twist ending. The whole thing turned out to a dream. A DREAM. I mean, this twist has worked in other movies before, but here it just feels cheap. Even though I obviously couldn't care less about the story, I felt cheated!(Spoilers end here.)In conclusion, after watching North, I think Roger Ebert was being too nice to this movie. That's how awful it is. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't stress that statement enough.

I realize it's usually considered a cop out, but it ties everything together so perfectly, and it is even strongly implied. Once you realize it's a dream, everything is from the point of view of a child, making the blatant stereotypes work, the strangeness and ridiculousness work, and a suspension of disbelief is no longer required. The story is simple and odd, just like many dreams are, and in my opinion, it's quite enjoyable to watch. Characters- The characters aren't too complex or established, but they're entertaining and quirky. North is fairly bland, but it's the strangeness of the rest of the characters, and his interactions with them that is so interesting.Comedy- I'm aware a lot of the comedy falls flat, but a lot of it works as well. There is a good bit of surreal comedy, some subtle comedy, and a huge amount of over the top comedy. I'd say about half of the jokes work, and while it is awkward when they fail, when they succeed they always get a laugh out of me. Imagery- There is a lot of strange, surrealistic imagery, which is strange for a kids film- a lot of people dislike it, but I find it refreshing. Tone/Atmosphere- There is a blatant tone of strangeness, just like a dream would be. It's just an all around quirkiness that makes the movie work, and while there isn't much in the realm of atmosphere, it's very tonally consistent. In conclusion, maybe my opinion has been completely warped by nostalgia, but I think it's a good movie. It's fun, quirky, and ridiculous, while also being simple and likable. It's by no means perfect, but I recommend you see it.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of things, wrong and unpleasant about this movie. The movie was often panned by many critics for its humorless jokes, adult content, racial insensitivity, ethnic stereotyping, cold-hearted characters, references to pedophilia and incomprehensible plot with an awful twist ending. I do agree with them, but I find myself, defending the movie, more, because it's told in the eyes of a trouble, often neglect, young child, North (Elijah Woods) who wish to have better parents. Without spoiling too much, I believe there seem to be more, to the film, that it's stating out. Based on the novel, North The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel, the movie started out with North having a panic attack, and begins to lose consciousness. Call it a depressing fan theory, but I really think, the whole movie secretly is about North's final thoughts. He either about to die, or in a coma-like dream, wondering if his parents honestly love him. It wasn't his parents in a coma, it was him. This would make sense, why his secret spot looks like self-made purgatory, and why his guardian angel (Bruce Willis) comes out, as the Easter Bunny. It's a hint to the idea of resurrection. North is stuck, there, until he can come to terms, if he wants to live with his parents or not. This would explain, why the rest of the story is told in a child-like view of the world. Everywhere that he visits, is shown like a cartoon, stereotype matter. It's ironic that North is his name, because everybody that follows a compass believes North is prime direction, but it wasn't until North step out his borders, that the film shows how little, he knows of the world, and how truly directionless, he is. There is a scene that explains, that North fails in geography that somewhat, proves this theory. Still, all these fan theories, doesn't excuse the movie for how stupid the movie is. There are scenes in the movie that are so obnoxious that it was a bit unbearable. The worst for me, has to be the musical number in Texas that I found annoying, ripping hard to rip away 1959's TV show Bonanza and 1978's show, Dallas. The whole journey of racist insensitivity was a bit rough. The most offensive, has to be the whole Eskimo 'flow' scene. At least, all the characters kinda stand out. It's so weird, seeing so many big names actors playing insulting characters. I really think actors like Kathy Bates, Reba McEntire, Dan Aykroyd, and others probably fired their agents after seeing their performance in this film. Other actors seem not to care too much for the film, and just wing it, like Bruce Willis, Richard Belzer & Alan Arkin. Then, there are those actors that play it as if they were just, doing another Seinfeld episode like Jason Alexander & Julia Louis Dreyfus. Some actors really did, put some work into their characters, such as John Ritter & Elijah Woods. It's also worth noting that the movie even has young Scarlett Johansson in a minor role. The movie took friendly jabs at film and televisions references, such as the squeaky clean 1950's family suburbia, 1954's Father Knows Best, 1957's Leave it to Beaver, and 1960's Andy Griffin Show. It downright, nearly parody them in the Nelson sequence. Other good things about the film, is how the movie was shot by cinematographer, Adam Greenberg. The opening with all the snow-globes, foreshadowing North's adventure was pretty cool to see. This movie is the film that got me, hook on collecting snow globes, so thank you for that. A lot of work, also went into the exotic sets. My favorite has to be the Eskimo village, where everything looks like it's made of ice. It remind me of the Flintstone, TV show, with its fantasy juxtaposition of modern everyday objects with that of ice world setting. That was pretty cool. The movie made great use of all the locations. It was breath-taking beautiful. One thing, I have to say, was amazing is the theme song from Marc Shaiman. It was so whimsical, but charming. Despite, the all-star cast, and a good director at the helm, North will probably be, most well-known as the film that got famous film critic Roger Ebert super-ass mad about. No doubt, about it, North will continue to receive aggressively negative reviews. Is the movie, the worst thing, out there? No. I have saw worst. Overall It's bad, but it can be 'so bad, it's good', somewhat watchable, if you turn off your brain. Check it out, if you want to, but I don't recommended, unless you want a headache.

It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie quirky and charming and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be so bad it's good. Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch.

Not that he's abused or anything (his house looks like it costs a million dollars, and it's all paid for by his father's job as a pants inspector and the pants inspector jokes are just the first in the long list of cheesy one-liners this movie is filled with) but his parents commit the great crime of not paying attention to him at the dinner table.And then there's what follows, which is North's journey to divorce his parents who are so shocked to hear the news that they both fall into a coma (and for some reason are later put on display at a museum) and the judge tells Noth he needs to find new parents before the summer is over.This journey takes North to Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, and onwards, where North meets auditioning parents, whose character portrayals take ethnic stereotyping to point that is so desperate and over-the-top that it makes you want to puke (seriously? Kathy Bates putting black-face on to portray an Eskimo? REALLY??) Every character in this movie is stupid, vulgar, and cold-hearted to the point of sadism.

And what is the point of Bruce Willis's character? He's supposed to portrayed as a guardian angel who follows North along his journey, (being portrayed as an Easter Bunny, a cowboy, a beach bum, a FedEx driver, and a sleigh driver) but he's incredibly unhelpful and only serves to throw in some phony pseudo-philosophical gems of wisdom dabbed with more lame jokes.The best parallel I can make with this movie is to compare it to that Rebecca Black's notorious music video Friday.

He travels to Texas, Alaska, Hawaii, Amish country, Africa, China, France, and Illinois. Part of the humor in this movie is the ridiculous views North has regarding the cultures in these various locations. His conceptions of these places are over the top, stereotypical, and, yes, maybe offensive to some. But, young North's dream world does not upset me because I am positive that all children aged 11 have some crazy ideas regarding different cultures.Of course, while North is gone his friend, the power-hungry journalist Winchel, uses North's emancipation to create an empire in which children rule. Winchel threatens that the situation will get ugly if North decides to return to New York and his natural parents.The movie has many stars in it, and it's clear that they had fun making this movie. My favorite, though, is Bruce Willis, who acts as North's guide along the way.I don't know if adults who have never seen this movie will appreciate it due to its narrow, childlike view of the world, but I loved it as a child and still enjoy the movie today.

It can't be the direction, it can't be the terrific actors's fault because their acting in the film is OK, and the movie is certainly not boring. It's the script. The script in this movie is meant to be laugh out loud hilarious and while sporadic jokes and events throughout the film are mildly funny most of the writing is embarrassing and uncalled for. Many people are blaming Reiner and the cast members for what went wrong with North and I'm sorry to disappoint you but I can't blame any of them. Sure Reiner may have chosen to direct the movie but because writer Alan Zwiebel chose to write this as unfunny and more or less a kid's movie with an adult mind that is the only way Reiner could direct it. I guess it could be an embarrassment for Reiner because he finished directing his most successful movie A Few Good Men a great film then followed up with a lousy film like this one. Maybe Zweibel needed a famous director like Reiner to direct his lousy writing skills. Of course this movie is now famous because Roger Ebert hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. I think Ebert was overreacting about hating it but I can certainly agree with him that the jokes in this movie were not funny and totally wrong-headed for a children's film. This is the kind of film that should be appealing to children 8-10 years old and Rob Reiner can make a children's film. He had success in this category with The Princess Bride. But do children's films contain jokes about testicles, sex and have an eleven year old say asshole and damn it.? And how is seeing the star of Die Hard in a bunny suit funny? More or less the idea of a kid shopping for a new set of parents may have been funny in the 1950's but it certainly isn't funny in the 1990's. North is a bad movie yes, but it is not worth hating. Ebert and everyone else who has told you this movie is deplorable is wrong. It is bad but is not so awful to where you would have to shut the movie off from your television set and the distributors should release a DVD at some point. If you want to see a good children's film by Reiner take The Princess Bride and skip North (if you can ever find it anywhere) but if you choose to watch North for whatever reason remember you may not like it but you don't have to passionately hate it like Ebert did.

The plot seems harmless enough, but that is just a cover for this movie's true evil. The story follows North, played by Frodo (Elijah Wood), a boy who emancipates himself from his parents (George and Elaine from Seinfeld) who he feels do not care about him. He gets this idea from, and I am being completely serious here, Bruce Willis in a rabbit suit. He has a year to find a new family or he will be put in an orphanage. So, he travels to such as Texas, Hawaii, Alaska and Africa, where a slew of unfunny ethnic jokes and horrible stereotypical racist displays of native cultures. Even the ending, where it turns out, in the most chiche of endings, it was all a dream, still infuriated audiences, even though it shows that this archaic display of racism never happened in real life.

Don't get me wrong, that movie is awful also. But with a premise as ridiculous and stupid as this, it's truly doomed from the start.The film revolves around a boy named North(young Elijah Wood) who feels neglected by his parents(Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss). So he hires a lawyer(Jon Lovitz) to disown him, and he goes around the world looking for new parents, which include a cowboy couple, Amish people, and Eskimos. Meanwhile, this annoying kid, really annoying, is practically taking over the planet, and trying to persuade other kids to disown their parents.Half of Hollywood is in this movie, and do you know why? No, seriously, I'm asking you.

Largely, they're absolutely right. But they also have at it in regards to the premise, and I would disagree with that. I actually think this is a pretty good concept for a family film. The writing is where this movie falls flat on it's face.There's nothing wrong with a fantasy-comedy film about a boy who sets out on an world trip to find the perfect parents. Nothing at all, unless it's this movie. North has got to be one of the most culturally insensitive, factually inaccurate, and stereotypical films I've ever seen. The entire problem with how the different cultures are depicted is that they're written as if this is a parody film. No, this is a FAMILY COMEDY (we'll use the word comedy pretty loosely here). Not a parody film. Big difference. This movie in no way purports to be a parody, nor does it attempt to draw that type of audience. That Rob Reiner would have released such a film really shocks me.These are the biggest problems, the inaccuracies and cultural insensitivity. Not for this type of film, not for it's intended audience. It's actually pretty appalling. Sure, I get what the writers were trying to do, the direction they were trying to go in. But that's not enough. Not when the end product is a cold-hearted insult to several different cultures. It's as misguided and stereotypical as a minstrel show.On top of that, this movie simply isn't very funny. Again, you get how they were TRYING to be funny. But you see it fall absolutely short.I have no beef with the concept at all. Had this movie been written in an entirely different manner, they'd have had a solid film here. It even has some solid star power. Nothing holds this back from being good more than the absolutely atrocious script. A script which seems to think that it's an entirely different film for an entirely different audience. And that leaves this movie with very little to make it worthwhile.

The story is based on the novel North The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as This is Spinal Tap (1984), Misery (1990), and A Few Good Men (1992).The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day &#x96; a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!. I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.)The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is! I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

You really felt cheated by this revelation? You couldn't figure it out for yourself?

Bruce Willis, Dan Ackroyd, Jason Alexander, Jon Lovitz, John Ritter, Annette Bening, and of course the director Rob Reiner are all in this film, which tells you this was not some of sort of cheap indie film made with lemonade stand money. Willis in particular keeps popping up as a different character, of course recognized by North, but never explained why he's there, other than to be cute. He keeps insisting he's someone different every time. At first, the movie didn't seem terrible, only just stupid, until Willis first appears--in a bunny suit. And then it goes downhill from there, plunging into the depths where many Ed Wood and similar fair are sitting on the proverbial ocean floor of bad cinema. The premise is the idea of a kid wishing to divorce his parents. He then travels to more parts of the world than all the Indiana Jones movies combined. I guess what people found offensive in this film is the stereotypes of the many potential parents North meets on his quest for the right parents, both foreign and domestic. Over-the-top oil Texans, vain Hawiians, drab Amish, bead-wearing Africans, and the creme-de-la-creme, French enamored with Jerry Lewis. But the award for the most offensive part has to be the heartless Eskimos who send poor dear old gramps onto a piece of ice to float into oblivion. When North asks about why they are doing this, they reply it's his time. Sort of reminded me of the bring out your dead bit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail where are an older man is being brought to the cart insisting But I'm not dead yet! Back at home, to pile on absurdity to more absurdity, North's parents have fallen into comas. But that's not the absurd part. They are on display in the Smithsonian Institute as the longest simultaneous coma in medical history. At the same time, kids all over the country are forcing their parents to be slaves lest they get a court injunction to divorce their parents like North. Starts making Ed Wood seem a little more intellectual. I read that Reiner at one point thought that Ebert's review of this film was not as harsh if you read between the lines, I know this is not true based on him saying that unseen demons took over his fingers as he wrote the review making his say he hated hated hated this movie. While Roger Ebert deplored this movie as being offensive (and possibly ranking it lower than Plan Nine from Outer Space), I found the resulting product how I would imagine if Ed Wood had been given a budget to direct a comedy. Some of the jokes are so bad they are funny, but funny for the wrong reasons. The jokes are so over-the-top which makes them sort of obviously sarcastic which is what makes it funny. Kind of in the same way lines from Plan Nine are funny, make you sort of half-life because of the sheer absurdity of it. The only line I found slightly original was the idea that adults could only go to R-Rated films if accompanied by a kid.But you know, I think every great film talent has to be in and/or make a truly God-awful movie, or you really aren't a heavy hitter in the industry. Spielberg made 1941. Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty made Ishtar. Christopher Lloyd was in Baby Geniuses. Reiner's turn with North. Remember, Razzy Awards are never easy to win.

Like I said, I found the movie interesting if nothing else.And to the reviewer who called this the worst movie ever, I say this you don't know the worst movie ever until you've seen the dreadfully boring Baryshnya-Krestyanka, which I saw while in St. Petersburg, Russia, last semester. If in fact it's based on an Alexander Pushkin novel, then Pushkin must spin in his grave every time someone watches that movie. The only way that I kept sane while watching it was by throwing out comments like on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (and then when I wrote a review to turn in, I dedicated the review to Bob Denver, who had died a few weeks earlier). My point is, even that last reviewer would have to agree that North looks like Citizen Kane compared to Baryshnya-Krestyanka.So that's my take on everything.

My Mom rented it from a video store I and I watched it when I had to flu. Perhaps it was because I was sick that enjoyed this movie, or perhaps it was because even at a young age I knew I loved absurdity. The crux of North is that it is a child's fantasy it doesn't make sense, it's dialogue is illogical and it's a little disturbing. However, recent sentimental or children's fantasy (Series of Unfortunate Events or Big Fish) are using techniques that North was using years ago. I won't make the assertion that this movie is avant garde, but if it was perhaps a little ahead of it's time, it'd certainly explain the slating it's receiving now. North has stuck with me for 8 years, and only now do I want to watch it again. Children's fantasy should do this; it's like Phoebe singing to the children about promiscuity, why lie to children?

Another Stand by Me this ain't.  Perhaps those involved would point out in their defense that most of the plot was just a dream North had, yet a sensitive viewer, especially of a supposedly wholesome children's or family film, might well be offended by its brazen exploitation, to the point of caricature, of regional, national, religious, and racial stereotypes.Another characteristic of this film I offer more by way of observation than criticism.  James Kincaid in his book Erotic innocence the culture of child molesting analyzes with particular insight how American cinema frequently appeals to its audience's repressed yet obsessive pedophilic interests.  This is a tradition of long standing in our fair land, going back at least to Shirley Temple.  While I do not recall whether Kincaid mentions North in his discussion, this film is a striking example in support of his argument.  We are invited repeatedly to view both North and Winchell, his young adversary, as sex objects.The most overt and notorious incident is, of course, the Hawaiians' proposal to advertise him openly as such. It stands to reason, doesn't it if a state were known as the home of nearly unclad eleven-year-old boys (one famously delectable and available boy in particular) who might be fully bared at a moment's notice, its residents should feel better about themselves and more loyal to the state, and others will move thither.  But there is much besides.First is the premise of the plot a boy needs love.  His parents don't give him enough, so he goes looking for someone to love him more, or in another way.  He even goes looking in Times Square, for crying out loud.  Many other children agree with this sentiment, to the point of political uprising. The most sympathetic and understanding mentor he meets in his odyssey is, rather than another parental couple, the Easter Bunny character (in his numerous incarnations), who has no desire to adopt him but who does, several times, take him for rides-- even though he is what one might call a stranger.These structural suggestions are well reinforced by the cinematography.  See North suspended from his crotch all-but-nude in a hang glider, or Winchell and his mentor enjoying together the sensual pleasures of a massage parlor.As Kincaid points out, acknowledged pedophiles don't need a black market of X-rated erotica when Hollywood has learned to cater so slyly and abundantly, under PG or even G ratings, to the unacknowledged predilections of their upstanding neighbors in middle America.

He then decides to divorce them, and go on a quest to find a better set of parents. It is a fun, family film, with a heart-warming ending, and it really does do a great job of filling all of the normal family film credentials. It has an issue, confrontation, problems, solving, trouble, and triumph, whilst remaining a genuine story. It truly was overlooked, and though it was nominated for the raspberry award, it didn't win, thanks to another Bruce Willis film (Color Of Night), which should tell you that it's really not all that bad.

The Showgirls of family films.Now here is a movie so wrong-headed, wrong-hearted, wrong-made... so wrong, you'd think the old axiom of a broken clock that's right twice a day would prove. But nope. Doesn't. By a long shot. One of my most depressing experiences as a child was seeing Rob Reiner's North. In fact, as extensive internet research has shown me, it was a painful experience for many as children and stayed with him throughout adulthood.One of the worst movies of the year. One of the worst movies of the decade. One of the worst movies ever made. One of the worst ever. And when I say worst, I'm comparing it to things like the Plague, Holocaust, World Hunger, AIDS and Leperocy.Elijah Wood is a wonder-boy who is constantly ignored by his parents despite his best intentions and efforts that make most parents beam like the sun with pride. He spends a lot of time feeling ignored and sits in a chair in a furniture store at the mall to think. He decides he deserves better parents than the ones he's got (who doesn't?) and divorces them.He travels all over the globe and finds surrogate folks which are not right for him. Not loving, caring, nurturing... or very funny or interesting.His best friend from school is enthusiastic about the divorce and gets the word out to all parents that children deserve better and thing better change or else.I was actually in physical pain watching how badly the film's plot is handled.While it is a thrill to see Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus together as a married couple and action legend Bruce Willis in an easter bunny suit... believe me, it doesn't last. The bad outweighs the good. Oh, HOW the bad outweighs...The big-name celebrity bit-players are many Aykroyd, McEntire, Lovitz, Willis, Greene, Vigoda, Belzer, Stein, Godunov, McGillis, Ritter, Johansson and Arkin; among others.Films with a big-name cast doing walk-ons is kind of tricky. Often this leads to a bunch of actors embarrassing themselves in bit throwaway roles for a quickie paycheck and the sake of work. It all really depends on the film itself; the screenplay and director.When a film with such a high pedigree of actors and filmmaker, Mr. Rob Reiner, you have to wonder why this whole damn thing went so incredibly wrong. And then kept going. And going and going. I am reminded of the legendary quote, Only those who dare to fail greatly, can achieve greatly. And just about all who flaunt this picture have achieved greatly at one time or another. So... there you go. The Ying to the Yang.The result can be Traffic. Or the result can be Even Cowgirls Get The Blues. You know, it's funny. When I first saw the trailer, I thought to myself, Wow. This looks like a good movie. I'm gonna see this one.And yes, the trailer damn well made this look like a good one. It just goes to show you... advertisements can make anything look appealing. Hey, remember Babe Pig In The City? The ads didn't make the movie look like much. But the movie was... wow.Hey, come to think of it-- I would like to advise to everyone who was unfortunate enough to see any more of this one that what they used for the trailers (so much as a frame more) to go out and rent Babe II.It's an ideal antidote. Of course, you may need a few days of bed-rest and antibiotics right after seeing North, but after that... please... don't let this one put you off movies. Or any of the truly gifted people who were associated with this abomination.Wood is one of the most talented actors ever to grace the business and the man seems unable to do a bad job on screen. Just check out Radio Flyer for evidence. But hey, like I need to tell you, right? But while his acting is on-par with Brando, Guiness, Hopkins, etc; not every movie to come his way compliments his talents. Just after the disastrous misfire The Good Son, this one floated it's way into theaters like a chunky, nutty, crooked turd after a whole year of improper diet. Adding further insult to injury.Seriously, I actually picture Jesus H. Christ himself on the cross, thinking to himself, I died for this... ? If I'd known, I wouldn't have bothered. We all make mistakes, even colossal ones. Even the best of us.Hell, especially the best of us! Disney was an anti-Semite, L. Ron was a pedophile, R. Crumb is a racist and misogynistic sycophant. And I myself...In summary, North is a childhood trauma that refuses to be repressed. For many, including myself. Don't let it be yours.Still, we are all mortal. We are all human. We all make mistakes, we stumble, falter. No one of us are infallible. Rob Reiner has delivered us When Harry Met Sally, The Sure Thing, This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and The American President. Surely, can't we forgive North? Only those who dare to fail greatly can achieve greatly. And Reiner has clearly done both. Let us at this as one of humanity's greatest follies... and try to find laughter in it. Not at the movie itself, which is clearly impossible, but at the movie's expense. Laugh, my children. Laugh, not with, AT, you see.OK, Mr. Reiner. You are officially forgiven. I already look forward to your next effort behind the camera. May you achieve as big a piece of the rock as fellow '70's-era actor-idol idol Ron Howard.

I really think some people use these film comments as an excuse to vent their frustrations at their spouse or their boss through their ridiculous tirades. I'll try to present an intelligent and useful opinion of this fantastic movie.Cherubic at 11-ish, Elijah Wood delivers an astounding performance for an actor of his age as North, a model child who doesn't like his parents, not because they don't let him do everything he wants to, as one reviewer wrote, but because they're negligent and self-absorbed (I believe there is a difference). He wins at court, not because this is a political drama, but because this is a FANTASY. It's a perfect example of Expressionist film An Everyman character with a journey, a quest to prove something, including a character that represents guidance and purity of thought and mind, with a resolution and a moral. See this film for what it is people. It is a FABLE, the fact that the revolution is led by kids is just a symbol. It could be dogs or infants for that matter. It's not even a fable about negligent parents or abused children, it's about finding out who you are and where you belong. Honestly, it even has spiritual overtones to it.Bruce Willis I find does his best work opposite kids (check out the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Mercury Rising, the list goes on). The supporting cast as the alternate as well as the original families are top-notch. I particularly enjoyed Jason Alexander, Jon Lovitz, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Reba McEntire's performances.What confuses me is how Siskel and Ebert could rate this the worst film of 1994, with its brilliant script, stellar cast and incredible look and feel. I usually agreed with their reviews (that is, until Roeper came along). So see this movie, try not to be overly-intellectual, like I know many people love to be, and try to actually learn something rather than be constantly entertained, although North does both.  I strongly recommend this for parents and children alike.  The BRIEF language is somewhat offensive, so parents can use discretion if they must.11/10.

Nothing could go wrong with this, right? Right?	But the movie you'd have would be North. And apparently things did go wrong. Many...many things. Or possibly the only thing that went wrong was the story chosen. The story is about an 11 year old boy named North (now how could a movie NOT be funny with such an unusual name for a character?), played by a pre-Frodo Elijah Woods, who feels his parents are mistreating him because they don't pay attention to him. So he gets a lawyer, who he finds literally chasing an ambulance, haha, and divorces his parents. Now because he's such an overachieving little wretch, letters come pouring in from families who would LOVE to have North as a part of their family.	Bruce Willis plays...well I don't really know WHAT Bruce Willis plays. Whatever he has of a character is too useless to be a guardian angel. He doesn't really DO anything. He first shows up in an Easter Bunny costume (the movie just keeps getting funnier and funnier) and sits next to North in his (North's) secret spot, a chair in the middle of a department store. Now, maybe Alan Zweibel's definition of 'secret' differs from mine, but shouldn't a 'secret spot' be a spot that nobody else knows about? I'm pretty sure at least a couple people noticed that, GASP, there's a chair in the middle of the department store.	Watching North is like receiving a shotgun blast to the crotch, stretched out over 87 minutes, only without as much permanent damage. Some of the people involved have done so many other great movies that I can forgive them for this. However, Alan Zweibel has not only done nothing of note besides this, he wrote the story this movie was based on. The script is the sole reason this movie is bad. It certainly isn't the actors; it's not the director, Rob Reiner. The plot twists, or attempt thereof, are lame, and the final one is just insulting to anybody who has the misfortune of watching this movie.	Avoid this movie at all costs.

But done in an expounding way too, so that children actually learn something from it. What child doesn't think of ranches and cowboy hats when thinking of Texas? Or icefishing and sled dogs when thinking of Alaska? The movie provides children with the enriching experience of travelling the world in a playful manner whilst dealing with the question Are other parents really better? As North eventually finds out, the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and the heartwarming ending will thaw even the most callous of hearts. Adults will enjoy this movie too, with all its quirky political humor and references to earlier films like Citizen Kane and even The Last Emperor. My personal wish was that I'd found out about this movie earlier. Sadly the market has been cluttered way too much by conventional uninspired titles such as Home Alone that keep gracing our television-screens ad nauseam and we're all so distracted that we have failed to appreciate this little gem. This film is so much better and deserves a lot more attention. Elijah Wood once again proves to be a superb actor, and it's amazing how seamlessly he fluctuates between adult humor and childlike jokes even at such a young age. After all, this was the early 90's and this mere fact provides the movie with a certain open-mindedness that would have been impossible to achieve in this day and age. The stereotypical way in which the different cultures are displayed would have run into major problems today with various groups undoubtedly deeming it to be intolerant or maybe even racist. But back then this was all OK and why not! The movie is a great medium for children to be edified and the peculiarities of the cultures portrayed in and outside the United States will certainly stick in their minds for the rest of their lives. It's fun! This movie deserves a big two thumbs up and I'd recommend it to anyone, it's a great movie for the whole family.

So it was with the reviews for this movie. I find that virtually every consensus opinion on IMDb is right on. When faced with a choice of movies to see I will often refer to this site to get a feel for which is the best selection and rarely am I mislead. Well, the record continues however, unfortunately, I ignored the warnings and watched this AWFUL movie. I just figured that with a cast like this and the direction of Rob Reiner that there had to be more to the movie. Boy was I wrong. What a waste of time and celluloid. AWFUL..Stay Away.

You have no idea how bad it is unless you see it. Still i suggest you don't, cause you'll totally regret it. The only funny thing about the movie was the scene with Bruce Willis in a pink bunny suit. Yes, I laughed at that scene. But that's it, all the rest is cr*p. Even the story is unbelievebly stupid a kid, upset at his parents, wins a trial and is free to choose the ideal parents, for a period of 3 months. Can you believe that? Ha... Well it's the worst movie Bruce Willis ever starred in and i am still amazed and surprised that he got involved in this sh*t. I used to appreciate Bruce for what he did but with this film he got a huge black ball in my eyes and i don't like him as much as before. Well it is totally pointless to stay and write here all the stupid scenes of the movie and everything that went wrong with it. Why? Because that would mean i'd have to write the whole script.  Ahhh I still can't believe how bad this movie has been! Unbelieveble! Just don't watch it!!!!!  Vote 1 out of 10.

Maybe it's because of Roger Ebert's bad review. I'd never heard of his review, and I'm glad I hadn't because I enjoyed it, and found myself laughing at quite a few points. Every time I watch it, I'm surprised at how good it really is, and how great an actor Elijah Wood is at such a young age. I also love Bruce Willis' character in this movie. He pops up in the oddest of places, and is a delight. It's such a shame that people don't give this movie a chance. So I'd say, if you like kids' movies and a bit of light comic relief, forget the reviews and give it a try.

SPOILER ALERT!!! Its all a dream. This is unfunny and poorly written garbage. The only positive thing is that it is family friendly. Except for the fact that it instills cultural stereotypes in the minds of impressionable children. If you are looking for a good movie for kids and parents to see together seek a different film. I am extremely surprised that it is rated as high as it is. Ebert and Roper have said in their review that it was the worst movie they saw in their 19 years of reviewing. Also they hated every minute of the movie. This slop should not be viewed. Better and funnier children friendly films have come out since then and this relic of the 90's should stay buried.

Its an excellent film which is also educational. The diversity of the cultural background Wood faces is eye-opening yet exciting! Its a movie worth watching! The first Elijah Wood movie I've seen, became a fan ever since! The name North is also synonymous to the traveling part. This comedy/family movie is not to be missed! I've watched it once and i'd watch it another time (if only i could get my hands on the DVD). Apparently Scarlett Johannsen also made an appearance in the movie (she was 10 at that time) worth catching a glimpse of the talented actress during her childhood debut. Watch it!!

When I walked out, all I could say was I actually handed over money to SEE this thing???!!!! It was HORRID! The acting left just about everything to be desired (Wooden is an insult to wood... Concrete-ian?. The plot stunk... I think Rob Reiner watched Dallas way too much for his plot twist at the end. Speaking of ends, the Hawaiian Tropic billboard parody had the whole theater (no more than 20 people) groaning in pain! The only redeeming feature of the movie was Bruce Willis (and this was during the period he was churning out garbage clones of Die Hard and was playing one character for the most part in all his films). The fact he was a relief in the movie as the Easter Bunny (Yes, that is not a mistake... he was the easter bunny) for me speaks volumes for how bad it was.I am a fan of bad cinema, but I don't think even MST3K could redeem this movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a -273.16 centigrade (Absolute 0 for you non-science types).

Here'swhy the movie is told from the point of view by a negelcted 11-year-oldwho is looking for a new family. The book is told from the point of viewof a 40-year-old comedian in the body of a 9-year-old. This movie iswonderful! Elijah Wood is good as North. Jon Lovitz plays Arthur Belt toperfection. Robert Costanza is good as always. This is one of BruceWillis's better roles, not only as the Easter Bunny, but as Gabby theranch hand, the beach bum, the sligh driver, Joey Fingers, and theFederal Express truck driver. Also the performances of Dan Aykroyd, RebaMcIntyre, Graham Greene, John Ritter, Kathy Bates, Julia Louis-Dreyfus,Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Faith Ford, Abe Vigoda and everyone elsewere scene stealers! I think the book sucks probably because I listenedto Rob Reiner read it on audio tape, that's probably why it sounds likea little kid talking like a middle aged comedian.
