It got panned because it couldn't live up to the first Ghostbusters. Well, what could? The first one was so original, so enormously popular than any sequel was bound to fail as far as matching it.This second Ghostbusters was just fine, very entertaining and it was nice to see all the main characters back. It had a little nicer feel to it and was more family-friendly language-wise, so it even had some things going for it the first one didn't have.The other major different in this sequel was watching Peter MacNichol, who reprized his Renfield-type character from Mel Brooks' Dead And Loving It comedy with Leslie Nielsen. Here, MacNichol plays Janosz Poha, another wacko with a thick Eastern European accent. He is hilarious, and elevates the enjoyment of this film. Otherwise, the rest of the cast plays and acts just as they did in the first film, which means you'll get a lot of laughs out of them The story just isn't as intense, that's all. No, it can't equal the original, but.....The bottom line is this Don't try to compare the two films. If you enjoyed the first, you'll like this.....period.

Nothing can come close to the gleaming perfection of the first film but damn it, the sequel works in most places. It's chiefly because the movie is just so damn entertaining! It's still mostly watchable despite its flaws and misjudgments about what the filmmakers may have seen as an apparent mean-spiritedness in a lot of people during the late '80s.True, comedian and star Bill Murray still steals the show whenever he gets the chance and he also gets some of the best lines, and he's just so gosh-darn funny as a leading man. Screenwriter team/co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are also in top form, and it shows in their wily and hilarious script. Unlike the first picture, though, it seems like they took the family-friendly route and didn't feel like building up to the oh-so-apocalyptic tone of the first film (even though Ghostbusters was still pretty funny aside from the occasional dark tone).And also, director Ivan Reitman knows their material and it looks like the filmmakers made the wise decision of bringing back everybody from the original film, including Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis. It's been five years since the first film (a title card confirms it), and it seems that most of New York City doesn't even remember who the Ghostbusters are and what they did for the city. Everyone in the city is miserable and the opening moments confirm that as well. After being almost bankrupted by countless lawsuits and being unable to practice their trade because of a judicial restraining order, the boys are reduced to moonlighting in other fields, such as catering to the needs of spoiled yuppie children at their birthday parties, a task that neither Ray Stanz (Aykroyd) or Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) take pride in.Egon Spengler (Ramis) is the only one of the original Ghostbusters who seems to have actually moved on with his life. Peter Venkman (Murray) hosts a television show called The World of the Psychic, a show that apparently draws in modest ratings but no respected psychic will appear on his show because they think he's a fraud. Anyway, things get underway when the boys discover that nasty pink slime of supernatural origin is discovered building up underneath the city, something that old friend and Venkman's old flame Dana Barrett (Weaver) realizes first hand when the slime attacks her infant son, and it's an investigation they have to do on the down-low because of their current legal situation.This slime, they learn, feeds off the misery and stress of a downtrodden New York City, and it's only getting stronger as the holidays are approaching. But because no one believes in ghosts anymore, their task is even more difficult. Well, after ghost-busting the two ghouls that crash in on their trial hearing, we have no choice but to be ready to believe them. They're back in business, all right - with cynical Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) answering the phones and Louis Tully (Moranis) on the books - tracing the source of their ghost-busting investigations to a 17th-century Moldavian tyrant named Vigo the Carpathian who wants in on the 20th century, and has possessed museum curator Janosz Poha (a hilarious Peter MacNicol) to go out and kidnap Dana's son so he can have a body so he can live again.One thing Ghostbusters II provides for the viewer is solid entertainment, which is what any good sequel should do. It would be impossible for this movie to any way live up to the original, so you can't blame the filmmakers for at least trying (trying is italicized). It would be pointless to say that the acting is good from our players, but my God, they're good and again in top form. The special effects are still pretty impressive, even from their early ghost-busting capers, to a finale where the boys are actually able to walk down the streets of the city in an animated - yes, animated! - Statue of Liberty (yes, Lady Liberty has sprung to life, and good thing she's on our side!). And even the R.M.S. Titanic (don't ask, just watch) pops up too.Ghostbusters II hasn't been particularly well-received, even despite its more family-friendly tone and message about the folly of mean-spiritedness. But it's just a good sequel, nonetheless, not bad, not superior to the original, maybe on par with the original, but it's just really good fun.8/10 "},{"Title":"Followed the first one too much.","Date":"7 April 2003","Score":"32 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This sequel to the successful movie Ghostbusters was itself, pretty successful.

The story of the slime was pretty good and it was funny seeing them do kid's birthday parties (though I doubt a kid at that time would have watched He-man cartoons).  In the end this movie suffers from the fact that it follows the basic structure of the first movie so there is nothing really different about it.  You have them investigating something, you have them dispatching a ghost, then you have the musical interval, then you have them locked up (in a loony bin this time), then you have a building taken over by the head ghost, and finally you have a giant thing walking through New York.  It just seems to me that with ghosts and other things, you could come up with a totally original and funny script without having to follow what worked in the previous chapter.  It is a shame too, that another Ghostbusters will probably never be made.  It would be interesting to see it, considering all the advancements in special effects.

It is also a known fact that people talk about a sequel, commenting that it was either better or worse than its predecessor. However when it comes to the sequel for &#145;one of the biggest films of the 1980's', that being Ghostbusters II, the fuss was not so big and the talk was not so loud, about it being good or bad. Although it was made a while ago, Ghostbusters II has many nostalgic moments, which makes me wonder why it is was not a hit. When Venkman says &#145;Sometimes, weird things happen, someone has to deal with it, and who are you gonna call?!', you know it is time once again to call on the &#145;Ghostbusters'.Five years after waging a war on slime that cost New York City millions, the Ghostbusters find themselves out of business--until an ancient tyrant, preparing a return to the Earthly domain through a river of slime under the city and his portrait at the Manhattan Museum of Art, sets his sights on Dana Barrett's baby as the new home for his wicked soul! With the help of the Museum's possessed curator, he plans to turn New York into a really scary place to live! Now only the Ghostbusters can save New York City, by turning paranormal pest control into an art form!The surprising part about this film is that almost every aspect from the first, returned to do it all a second time. Director Ivan Reitman does a grand job in directing Ghostbusters II. I am certain that he wanted to make this film as similar to the first Ghostbusters as he could, considering that formula seemed to be very popular with many movie fans. The screenplay was once again written by two of the stars of the movie, that being Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis. They certainly put a lot of thought into the humour being presented, which made this film seem very original and funny. If either of these areas of Ghostbusters II were a failure, than I am sure that this film would not have been anywhere near as good, as I thought it was.I was glad to see all the cast back for a second time. The way we see the Ghostbusters five years on is very amusing. With two of them doing parties and being a joke, one doing a TV talk show and the other being a psychologist. Bill Murray still added that funny touch to the movie, with his character of Venkman being outrageous, which made the movie funny to watch. All the other Ghostbusters characters were good once again. Stantz, Spengler and Zeddemore are as they were before, smart or as silly as ever. Breaking up this team would for me seem an injustice.The supporting cast was also good. Dana Barrett was performed well again by Sigourney Weaver. Dana is a woman whose life always seems to be troubled by paranormal pests and a man by the name of Venkman. Joining the cast is &#145;Ally MacBeals' Peter MacNichol, who is the zany character of Janosz Poha, Dana Barrett's possessed art boss. I also found it clever to have the characters of Janine (Annie Potts) and Louis (Rick Moranis) return as lovers, as this adds a bit of spice and variety to the story. Furthermore, Dana's baby Oscar was a cutie, and by the end of the movie was an integral character to the makeup of the story. Add in the return of Slimer, which although he was not as funny as I had hoped he would be, put a smile on my face every time I saw him.  There are some very funny scenes and lines in Ghostbusters II. I like how the movie starts, with Dana's baby carriage just taking off by itself. Then you also have the funny courtroom scene, where the Ghostbusters are charged as guilty of their crime, then in the next instant are tackling ghost in the courtroom, by the judge's requests! At the end of this scene the guys remark &#145;Two in the box, ready to go, we be fast and they be slow'. Yet when we see a river of slime under the city, which can cause people to turn evil, you know that the fun has returned again. Then for a cop to exclaim that &#145;the titanic has just arrived', was a very game scene to create in a movie, but very funny as well. Only the Ghostbusters could get away something like that. Furthermore, to top the first movies &#145;Marshmallow man', the scene with the &#145;Statue of Liberty' was very ingenious and makes for a hilarious time, as I wanted to see what would happen next.I can not remember if this was a big movie back when it was released in 1989. I am surprised if it wasn't, as it was everything that you could want from a sequel, and that little bit more. Although it was not as good as the original, I still had a fun time watching the Ghostbusters a second time around and is must-see for fans. With great special effects, funny story and roles from all involved, Ghostbusters II is not as bad a sequel as some would have you to believe. What's more, I was reading the other day that there was talk of Ghostbusters III. Part of me is a little disappointed that this film never made it off the ground, because just imagine all the fun that we have missed out on seeing.

And its not hard to understand why. It had a fantastic idea. And matched it with the perfect cast to turn the No 1 box-office hit of 1984 into an enduring classic.Then five years later, the cast and production team returned for this sequel. But unfortunately, as is often the case of sequels, they seldom live up to their predecessors. Ghostbusters II is lacking in the energy and drive that propelled the original, something that reflected the box-office takings. Part 2 seriously underperformed compared to Part 1. They just couldn't repeat the same magic twice.All the cast are back, and Ivan Reitman is again directing, but there's nothing terribly original about this film. Its just a retread of the first, with only a few novelties thrown in for good measure.There is a bit of poignancy in the early scenes. Time has not been kind to the Ghostbusters. Because there is no Ghostbusters anymore. When they saved the world from the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (the only one who doesn't return for Part 2), they also put themselves out of business.Venkman (Bill Murray) now hosts a psychic cable show for fraudsters. He knows he's a fraud, but at least he's honest about it! Ray and Winston (Dan Aykroyd & Ernie Hudson) are reduced to making appearances at kiddie birthday parties. And Egon (Harold Ramis) has gone back to standard scientific research.But trouble is brewing on the horizon. And again its Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who brings the team into action. Dana now works at an art gallery, and one of the paintings she's restoring is possessed by the spirit of an evil dictator, Vigo. Vigo wants to return to the physical world, but he needs to possess a child to do it. And he's chosen Dana's baby boy, Oscar.Add to that a river of slime running beneath the streets of New York that feeds off the bad vibes of the people above, and we have another apocalypse on our hands.Its a bit hard to pinpoint why Ghostbusters II disappoints as much as it does. There's just no life to it. Its all perfectly watchable but it never raises anything more than chuckles while Part 1 induced aching sides. The cast are all present and correct, but even they go through the motions.You can tell Bill Murray is coasting his way through the part. Something that's not a pretty sight to see. When Murray is engaged and attuned to material, he can turn in a fantastic performance. But when the material doesn't interest him, his laid-back nonchalance turns sluggish. Something that seriously undermines the film as a whole. Films like the horrendous Scrooged and the utterly tedious The Life Aquatic.Ernie Hudson is once again moved to the sidelines, but at least Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are given a bit more to do this time. The one thing in the film's favour. The only complaint I had with Ghostbusters was that all the best lines were given to Murray. And Aykroyd and Ramis were a little upstaged. But they're given quite a few witty one-liners here. And Egon is especially funny, who gets some cracking wry observationsWell Peter was borderline for a while...then he crossed the border.Its nice to see Sigourney Weaver back, but she isn't given much of a chance to shine. She's just reduced to playing the cuddly working mum. And the film could have done without Rick Moranis. He overplays the Woody Allen shtick to the point I wanted to strangle him.And we get a really grating performance from Peter MacNicol as a foreign curator who works at the gallery and gets possessed by Vigo. Shame because MacNicol is usually capable of great things. Just watch any episode of Ally McBeal. But here he's wasted in a part that's beneath him. And that scene where he runs through the night-sky with a pram is just plain silly. The film's best scene is when the Ghostbusters end up in court for blacking out the whole city through illegal drilling (which is a bit preposterous). Its the one scene in the whole film where it manages to recapture the spirit of the original. Everyone is given plenty to do. Quips rebound back and forth like a tennis match. An hilarious turn from Harris Yulin as a fire and brimstone judge. And it all culminates in a dazzling showcase of special effects work when two ghosts from the judge's past return to seek revenge. Classic!But elsewhere the film is thoroughly routine. The effects work is just as good as you'd expect. But the big climax with the Statue of Liberty walking through the streets of Manhattan, an obvious attempt to rehash Mr Stay Puft is not nearly as thrilling as it should have been. And I never once believed it was a statue come to life. Just somebody dressed up to look like it.Ghostbusters II has its moments, but it moves in fits and starts. The two story lines of the painting and the slime never converge. Something it tries to achieve but never quite manages. And Oscar is a McGuffin purely designed to move the plot along. Nice gag at the end with the new and improved painting, but overall Ivan Reitman fails to deliver. Something that would become a depressing habit with him.

Ghostbusters II should have opened with a huge set-piece (ala James Bond) and then launched the title screen. We have seen these guys set-up, we have had the origin story, they were cheered by the city after saving the world from 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together mass hysteria!Get the point?Instead the movie stumbles over the starting line by announcing that they were sued by everyone in New York for blowing-up Spook Central and were labelled as frauds. Yeah, because conjuring up a very tangible Marshmallow Man and Gozer's voice booming all over Manhattan is easy to pull off when you're a conman. Not only that but the team have disbanded and Dana has married someone other than Peter. In five years she dumped him, married someone else, had a kid with him, and was dumped herself when he left to go to Europe. That timeline seems a little tight.A portrait of a gruesome medieval warlord being brought to a New York museum coincides with a viscous, psycho-magnatheric river of slime materializing beneath the streets. All of the hate and anger in New York has became tangible and is giving Vigo the Carpathian power from his painting. He wants to inhabit a newborn on the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve and thus take over the world some time later. He's hardly Gozer. Vigo does pretty much nothing for the whole movie and his motivation to become a 90s baby doesn't exactly frighten us.Where is the darkness? This movie is far too light-hearted, helped none by Randy Edelman's lame score which is absolutely no match for the power of Elmer Bernstein from the first movie. Lazlo Kovac's is gone, by Michael Chapman does a fine job in his place, with some truly wonderful wide shots and camera blocking featuring up to six characters at once. GBII has great anamorphic photography but the darkness is not there and it is needed.It satisfied me as a kid, but I can't help but be disappointed at the numerous missed opportunities when I watch it as an adult. It should have been more. It should have been much, much more.I also find it odd that for a film that has a climax set on New Year's Eve there is not one mention of Christmas. And what's twice as weird, or just plain lazy, is the fact that the real life building that became Spook Central in the first movie is visible during the montage scene. All the had to do was point the camera in another direction or use a matte painting to alter it back to its fictional appearance.

Regardless of all these factors, Ghostbusters 2 is easily one of the best sequels ever produced in motion picture history.This movie takes place fives years after the events of the first Ghostbusters flick. Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston have been given a judicial restraining order by the entire New York community. The order strictly forbids them performing services as ghost busters. You see, even though they saved the world from utter destruction at the end of GB1, they caused a lot of damage to a high-rise apartment building located near Cenral Park. However, the boys reunite after Dana has a scary and mind-boggling experience when her infant son, Oscar, is mysteriously taken away while in his carriage out on First Avenue. After some investigation and deliberation, they decide to jackhammer a hole in the middle of the busy intersection. When Ray goes below like a worm on a hook he discovers a river of pink slime flowing heavily under the city. Later in the movie, the find out that the slime is the living embodiment of the bad vibes and negative feelings that have been generated over time by the citizens of New York City.Right now I would like to elaborate on what is perhaps the most memorable sequence in the entire movie the courtroom scene. Following their late-night excavation on First Avenue, Peter, Ray, and Egon are arrested for willful destruction of public property and causing a blackout over the entirety of New York City. The three of them are put on trial in a court of law presided by Judge Stephen Wexler. Wexler's nickname is The Hammer. This is so because he is a constant gavel banger and screams at other people just for the fun of it. Therefore, Judge Wexler is very sadistic, arrogant, and closed-minded. He also has a very lousy temper. As a result of his hot anger towards the guys, the pink slime in the jar present in the room bubbles like crazy and eventually unleashes two gigantic apparitions the Scoleri brothers. The judge recognizes them because he himself gave the brothers the death penalty for murder a long time ago. The two ghosts now want to kill him. All this chaos forces the judge to eliminate their restraining order so that the two ghosts can be removed from the courthouse. They succeed and the Ghostbusters are back in business.Ghostbusters 2 is truly a magnificent motion picture! The courtroom scene and many other moments will have you laughing like a maniac. This movie, like the first one, will forever remain to be a favorite with me.

Ramis & Aykroyd c-wrote the screenplay and it's a sequel to the hugely successful Ghostbusters from 1984. Plot follows on from the first film but five years later and sees the Ghostbusters disbanded after being derided as frauds and handed a bill for the damages incurred as they saved the world! However, a new supernatural threat is bubbling down in the sewers of New York and now more than ever the Ghostbusters are back in vogue.It was probably asking too much for this sequel to be as sparkling as the first film. More so when one considers that there was a 5 year gap in between and a new decade was soon to arrive that firmly had no place for 80s nostalgia. Oh Ghostbusters 2 was a success, very much so, but after the rush of fans wanting some more from the kooky parapsychologists had died down, the feedback was very mixed from fans and critics alike. Understandably so since everything about this sequel is tired. The characters look bored and lack the expresso timing that was once evident, especially Murray who is badly underused here, and more troubling is that his Venkman, the best thing about the original film, is reduced to being a normal type bloke. That's criminal, because the spirited stuff falls to Aykroyd and co and tho they be solid pros, they ain't got Murray's wit and mannerisms.The story too is weak. Featuring a seventeenth century tyrant and the inevitable rise of spooks unbound. Thankfully, tho, the effects are at least of the high and gloopy standard set first time around. And there's some tight gags in there for the knowing Ghostbuster ear. But repetition hangs heavy throughout, Ramis & Aykroyd seemingly not grasping that what worked in 84 will not totally transfer well to a new crowd who are now older and wiser. There's also the distinct feeling that this film is more about a cast get together to make some easy cash than enticing in a whole new audience. Peter MacNicol is a welcome introduction to proceedings as Janosz Poha, while more of slimer (who is now real cool) is never a bad thing. But the magic is gone and Ghostbusters 2 just comes off as shallow and dangerously close to soiling our love of the first picture. 4/10 "},{"Title":"The worst sequel I've seen so far","Date":"8 July 2012","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Review":" In 1984, 'Ghostbusters' came out to be ranked 28th in The American Film Institute's top 100 comedies of all time.

How do you make a sequel ten times better then the first? You've got to go bigger. Sometimes you lose the relationships with sequels that are from the original that are unexplained. You lost a bit of the relationship between Peter and Dana. Without those relationships the film and script would make more sense.

It simply cannot compete with the original movie, which, while similar to many films, still had that air of originality that this film simply lacks. Ghostbusters did launch a franchise of its own (with T-shirts, toys, a computer game, an animated series, as well as two sequels) but there does come a time when a concept falls flat, and there are movies that simply do not need a sequel.As can be expected, after saving the city the Ghostbusters have been forgotten and relegated to appearing at children's parties and dodgy TV shows. Dana has moved on, had a baby, and been married and divorced, and basically the city now considers them a bunch of frauds. It is amazing how quickly people forget, especially since ghosts were running about the city, but I guess that as time passes, people relegate these things to delusions and dreams.However, such is a city like New York, that there are always going to be more dangers, and when some force attempts to steal Dana's baby, the Ghostbusters are called back to investigate. However, during their investigations (which involves digging a hole in the middle of a New York Street) they are arrested and brought to court (and a court that refuses to believe in the supernatural) to face trial. It is then when the ghosts reappear, and suddenly those whom people had rejected are brought back to the forefront.In one sense, this film continues the theme of science trumping faith, however it also shows the nature of the fickle society, and the Ghostbusters are fools to accept it (or maybe they are simply good hearted people). After being stuffed around by all those who suffered losses after the last event, they are more than ready to come back and help their city in need (and one wonders if they will reject them again once the bad guy is defeated). There is a further concept of the positive and negative vibes of the city. It is mentioned a few times that the city is full of bitterness and hate, however they come with the symbol of liberty to break this cycle and thus dissipate the energy that is driving the bad guy.It is a bit like that in this world where hatred and bitterness tends to swell up making life ever more unpleasant for people. It takes a life time to build a reputation and a moment to destroy it. However, as anger and hatred build upon each other, forgiveness cuts through it like a knife. I have seen, and even experienced, how the desire for revenge corrupts you on the inside, but an act of forgiving those who wrong you can free you from those chains to enable you to move on and grow.

However the writer/director chose to make a well-paced sequel without trying to do to much.    The writing focuses on wise one-liners that work pretty well keeping in line with the wittiness of the first film. The love angle between Lewis and Janine was a little silly and overwrought and took away from some of the adventurous feel of the first film. The sequel also lacks that us against them vibe that made the first so enjoyable. However I applaud the writer/director form very playfully staying within the same story and not trying to do too much. The special effects were virtually unimproved on from the first film but this gave an air of normality to usually bloated sequels. The romance between Murray and Weaver was amusing and the performances of all the cast were on par with the first. Also Vigo made a much more scary and funny villian than the pathetic Zule creature from the first.      Although it cannot create the fun and excitement of the original Ghostbusters II will not disappointment fans of the first films sly humor and cheesy/entertaining action.

This is Ghostbusters. And the last person to be a father is Venkman. And no, I don't think that the humour resulting in his inability to cope with marriage is a good premise for the film.So the whole thing started badly. Lucky for us they were not afraid to repeat some of the stuff from the first plot regarding the ghosts themselves, although the whole idea of being able to give slime both a positive and a negative polarity only confused me and was never really explained.Anyway, the bad guy is pretty good. Too bad he is not made more prominent and that so much time is wasted on Venkman's crumbling relationship with Dana. Also, there is a problem with the pacing. While Ghostbusters had a wonderful, natural flow, Ghostbusters II is disjointed and comes across as a series of episodes - some funny, some not so funny. The climax is no match for the climax of the first film and the whole thing ends too quickly and through some lazy writing - or perhaps the problem was a limited budget.In any event, I can't shake the feeling that this was more of an attempt to make some more money than to amaze and please the audience.

If they were good, they probably would have refused to make this steaming pile of slime. If they were lucky, well, their luck ran out this time. Ghostbusters 2 is thoroughly uninspired, pointless, full of plot holes and is a mere semblance of the original's fine craftsmanship.The movie makes no sense. For starters, as with a lot of sequels, it starts out with people who were living happily ever after at the end of the first movie. If they were still living happily ever after, there'd be no point to this crappy follow-up, so of course somewhere since the end of the first movie, stuff happened and no one's happy any longer, including the audience. And, as with many sequels, they decided to take some elements of the first movie and have the audience choke down a ton more of it. Somehow, they got the idea that slime was really funny in Ghostbusters so let's make the slime a star and parade it endlessly across the screen. The premise seems to be that there's a river of negative emotion, in the form of slime, under NYC that runs towards, for no particular reason, and terminates at a museum with a really big painting of a sixteenth century whack job. So, we have the slime and we have the bad guy and they seem to be related. There's slime, and there's a bad guy... and there's slime&#x85; and a bad guy. I give up. Now, the bad guy, rather than come back to life as a full grown evil overlord who will rule the world, decides that he should grab some baby from someone (conveniently, Dana just happens to have one) and manifest his evil presence inside it and in seventeen or eighteen years, he'll be ready to rule the world when he gets out of high school. I smell an Oscar. Heh Heh.The movie starts out with bold letters telling us Five Years Later. Uh huh. Five years after, I guess, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man victory that, apparently, turned out to be a flurry of lawsuits and career ending bad vibes when the city woke up the morning after and realized it hadn't gone to bed with Mr. Right. Oh well, I guess when we saw all of the cheering New Yorkers admiring the ghostbusters in the first movie, we were MISTAKEN! Dana and Bill's character (that's right, I don't even CARE what his character's name is anymore) didn't get married because Bill has problems with the whole commitment thing. Then, Dana married some other guy who we never see and know nothing about who impregnated her about a year before this sorry excuse for a movie begins and then he moved to London. I guess he had commitment problems too. At least the baby didn't pop out of her chest but I digress. The rest of the movie is more like a series of SNL skits that have little to do with each other. A lot of the actors who graced the first movie showed up for this one. The mayor, the accountant, the secretary who just magically shows up and becomes one again once the slime patrol regains its credibility, the slime guy who slimed Bill Murray in the first movie.The movie is absolutely full of plot holes and stuff that happens for no particular reason. Rick Moranis was an accountant but now he's an attorney who has no courtroom experience. Later, he somehow hooks up with Annie Potts (the secretary) who is interested in him for no apparent reason and they get down in Dana's apartment. It gets worse. At what passes for the movie's finale, he has his own ghostbuster uniform and his own proton pack. Annie packs him off to wander the streets looking for a ride to the museum and finds the slimer is driving the bus. OK, where's the exit? The original ghostbusters, in the meantime, have commandeered the Statue of Liberty and animated her so that she trudges off to the museum too, with the busters riding in her head. OK, so the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man couldn't do this movie because he had a previous engagement, right? I mean, if they're going to create one ridiculous, nonsensical plot hole after another, surely they could have glued Stay Puft back together, yeah? What other giant thing can we have walking down a busy NYC street smashing police cars inadvertently? Never mind that she's metal and could only manage to waddle incoherently towards the target. We animated her so now she's not metal. Fine, whatever. These two train wrecks converge on the museum. Liberty smashes the sky light. Oh goody, another lawsuit for Ghostbusters 3 if they can talk the studio in to financing it. The overlord shows up, makes some faces. The slime shows up and, well, slimes some faces. In a final bit of stupidity, Rick Moranis's character stands outside with a crowd that has appeared out of nowhere to sing Auld Lang Syne. In an amazing bit of timing, since he's in no way in communication with the actual ghostbusters, Rick shoots off his proton gun at the same time the other ghostbusters do and saves the day, er, night, er whatever. Happy New Year, New York, New York.At this point, I'm having an out of body experience as this horrifyingly bad movie has sucked the will to live out of me. Oh my god, Bill. I've got news for you, dude, Garfield wasn't your biggest mistake after all! Perhaps drinking heavily before and during the movie would have helped. Anyway, the baby is safe, Dana is in love with Bill Murray's character again and the whole motley crew oozes it's way in to the sunset, er, moonset, whatever, to continue their happily-ever-after-or-not lives.

They investigate the strange occurrence & along with the other Ghostbusters Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) & Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) discover a huge river of the pink slim running under the city, a pink slime that feeds off negative emotions & there's plenty of them around New York. This discovery coincides with a huge resurgence in supernatural activity in New York which allows the Ghostbusters to reunite & reopen the business, they discover that an evil 16th Century tyrannical sorcerer named Vigo (Wilhelm von Homburg) is about to be re-incarnated so he can take over the world... Who ya' going to call to sort it out?Produced & directed by Ivan Reitman this is to date the only sequel to the huge hit that was Ghost Busters & while not as good is still a fine film. The script by stars Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis reunites all the old cast although the inclusion of Rick Moranis' nerdy character Louis Tully seems rather forced & unnecessary. However on the whole the film works very well, is good fun & provides plenty of light hearted entertainment. Obviously the scare factor isn't high as to appeal to he kids but there's still plenty of ghost's, ghoul's & slime to go around. The comedy elements are amusing enough, the interplay between Stanz & Spengler is quite funny & Murray's sarcastic Venkman still raises a smile. The story this time around is what lets the film down I suppose, there's not really enough here to pad out the almost 2 hour running time & the connection between the pink slime, Dana, her baby & Vigo & how it all ties to the Ghostbusters is somewhat thin to say the least, it never comes together with any great conviction but the film moves along at a nice pace & as I've said it provides lots of good, clean entertainment that's fun to watch.Director Reitman does OK but I got the feeling while watching it it borrowed a lot of ideas from the original especially the end where the Statue of Libery walks through the streets of Manhattan which is almost identical to the end of the original with the Marshmellow Man causing havoc. Considering this was made in the 80's I was actually rather impressed with the special effects & thought they were very good except the ridiculous scene where the villainous Peter MacNicol is flying through the air dressed as a nanny complete with pram which looks awful. There are some good scenes, the fur coat that comes alive, the ghost train, the Titanic arriving & lots of other ghostly goings-on.Technically the film is great & has that big budget Hollywood polish about it, the effects are good & the famous Ghostbusters theme is used once or twice. The acting is fine although I'm not sure about MacNicol's performance as he has a highly irritating accent & he annoys.Ghostbusters II is a good sequel that I enjoyed a lot although it's not as good as the original but there aren't many films that are in my opinion. Well worth a watch if your looking for some scary light hearted supernatural fun, definitely recommended.

It has some sparkling dialogue and has improved the special effects, not an easy task. If you liked the original, you will enjoy the sequel. But it is hard to face the facts that the original will be remembered as the classic, no matter how much money Ghostbusters II makes.*Plot* (Maybe Some Spoilers)The story picks up five years after New York city was saved from the evil Gozer by the Ghostbusters. But they were sued by the city for the excessive damages they did and are now starting over. Ray Stanz (Dan Aykroyd) has his own occult bookstore and teams up with Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) to entertain as Ghostbusters at kiddie parties. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) has his own TV show, World of the Psychic, which is completely garbage and disrespected. Only Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) manages to continue working at the university. The trouble starts when Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), the woman the Ghostbusters saved in the original and Peter's ex-girl, goes to Egon for help when her carriage spins out of control on its own, pushing her young son Oscar (from a previous marriage) through the bustling Manhattan streets. After some investigation, Ray, Egon and Peter find a river of pink slime running under the city. They test it and realize that it is being created by all the negative energy of the city, which it feeds off of. The slime is being harnassed by a sinister maniac named Vigo from hundreds of years ago, represented in a painting at the museum where Dana now works. Soon, ghosts are back running rampant through the city, the slime is overflowing, and Vigo is planning to take human form! Who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!*End of plot*I really enjoyed the first parts of the movie, where it showed what the Ghostbusters had been doing for the last five years. It reintroduced the characters perfectly, which is very important in a sequel. All the actors are back in top form I especially liked that Ray and Egon were more loose in this movie and somewhat less technical. Winston also has more scenes than in Ghostbusters. But some things you shouldn't change Bill Murray is still hilarious as Peter Venkman.However, some characters were reintroduced poorly. The first time we see Janine (Annie Potts) is when she answers the phone at Ghostbusters HQ, announcing that they are back. She also has a new love interest in Louis Tully (Rick Moranis). But in the first film, Janine had a thing for Egon and Louis for Dana. Why is Louis Tully hanging around with the Ghostbusters? The only time he helps them is when he represents them at a trial, if you call that help. Janine had some great scenes in the original, but she has none here. In fact, my favorite scene with her was during the end credits, where she carries off some ghost traps after the boys return from bustin'. It is never explained what she or Louis did during the five year absence of the Ghostbusters.The plot is actually a little bit more focused than the original, which was more of how the Ghostbusters got in business and less about Dana's problems (until later). The sequel keeps things focused on the slime, Vigo and only lets slip a little with Dana and Peter's romance. Thats another thing I had trouble with in the beginnning, Dana says to Egon that she would prefer that Peter would be left out of the investigation into the carriage phenomenon. But when he gets involved, Dana seems too easy she initiates the first moves when she and Peter go out to dinner (which she agrees to quite quickly). Considering the way she describes her relationship with Peter directly after the events in Ghostbusters, this seems quite suspicious. But getting back to the plot, it is more focused, but a little ridiculous. Its fun to see the Ghostbusters have fun testing out the mood slime, but later, *SPOILER* when they spread the mood slime all around the Statue of Liberty and have it parade down Broadway using the positive energy of the New Year's Eve crowd, it gets a little silly. *END SPOILER*It can't quite match the original scene for scene. The first film had classic scene after classic scene. While the sequel has a few good ones like the trial and testing the slime, the scenes underground when Ray, Egon and Winston are searching for the source of the slime is quite poor, along with the Dana and Peter dinner scene. It doesn't help that these two are intercut.But lets get down to the good parts. The movie still has the classic one-liners or t-shirt lines that the original had. Peter is still given the best dialogue, but the banter between all of the Ghostbusters is quite good, especially Egon and Ray. The special effects are improved from the first, whose were excellent. Again, the writers (Aykroyd and Ramis) and director (Ivan Rietman) make you believe in the outlining premise of ghosts in Manhattan. You may question the details of the story but the world that is created is very believable.In closing, the film is not as scary as the first, even though that was not very frightening to begin with. Also, kudos to Peter MacNicol for his funny performance and great speech and mannerisms.For Ghostbusters fans, this is a must see. For others, see the original and then make up your minds whether or not you would like Ghostbusters II. The film had the bad sense to open one weekend before the box-office champ of 1989, Batman. With a great box-office intake of $112.5 million (but poor compared to the original film's $238.6 million in receipts) and 11 years past, it is unlikely that Ghostbusters III will ever come to pass, although Aykroyd says he is working on a script. But who knows? Harrison Ford is gunning to make Indiana Jones IV at age 58 and 11 years after the last entry.In any case, enjoy.

I was a big fan of Ghostbusters when I was nine or ten.  I eagerly awaited this film and saw it the day after it came out.  I was not disappointed.  Of course one reason was that I had a crush on one of them (as I mentioned in the comments on the first film), and I still won't say who.  But an interesting new twist was added to the mix... a baby!  I have always loved babies, so this was one of the coolest things they could have done.  Incidentally, as is documented here but is not common knowledge, the twins who played Oscar were twin nephews of the late John Denver, and one even has his birth name.  The twins  have never been heard of again (talk about a way to chronicle a child's early years though).  I often wonder what they look like and what they're up to.  They would have to be about 12 years old now.   I now own this movie and I'm glad that even though my interest in Ghostbusters has diminished and that embarassing crush has faded away, one of the reasons I always loved this movie was because of just how cute Oscar was.    Of course the storyline and the special effects were outstanding (they went with ILM this time)... but the pivot to my enjoyment of the film was the baby.  But that might just be me.  They do this alot in movies, though;  make a child the target of evil.  But in this one, it's not overdone.And many people say it wasn't bad, for a sequel!

The lack of imagination, the reworking of the same old plots of the first film and, despite an impressive Titanic piece at one point, the overall restraint on special effects.The best part of the film was the courtroom scene where Louis hilariously referenced the first film when he declared that the Ghostbusters helped him after he was turned into a dog which lead to a climax with criminal ghosts The Scoleri Brothers going on a rampage.Everybody involved were really up for it (though I thought Janosz's voice got irritating after a while) but either the dialogue seemed poor or the delivery just didn't seem right, therefore missing as much as hitting with the wise-cracking. Oh, a heck of a lot of posturing was involved too. Four people having little to do in the film certainly had a lot to say for themselves, lol.The emotional attachment between Peter and Dana was unnecessary and mere plot padding as Venkman's wise-cracking attachment to her child ruined the character's credibility. I always felt that Venkman's goal in life was to avoid responsibility and emotional attachment so the plot development didn't feel right. I do get the feeling that Hollywood producers say; You know, we need to add forty extra minutes to the film what do we do? I know, let's add a romantic subplot.The Statue of Liberty scene was almost a remake of The Stay Puft Marshmallow man in the original film only this time the perspective was reversed. Instead of a bad marshmallow man lumbering about the city at the end we have a good Statue of Liberty lumbering about the city at the end. I guess the film was pretentiously talking about karma but I'm not sure the message was successful.Finally, Vigo was very lethargic when he finally crept out of the painting. I was wondering at one point whether he had emerged at all, lol.Some trivia for you...* The psychiatrist was played by Brian Doyle Murray - Bill Murray's brother. He again teamed with Murray in the film 'Groundhog Day' (which Harold 'Egon Spengler' Ramis directed).* In the scene where the effects of the slime was affecting New York, the people were running out of the cinema. The film that was showing was called 'Cannibal Girls'. That was referring to the first film Ivan Reitman directed in 1973.The film is passable on any other level but I was hoping for something much more than I got.

Mainly the scene's with the three Ghostbusters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are extremely fun to watch but also the Rick Moranis scene's are highly fun, also thanks to the dialog he had been given.But no, it's not the perfect sequel. The movie and its story take itself a bit too serious at times, especially towards the ending. The movie is also a bit too much horror like. The movie gets quite scary at times, also due to the seriousness in the movie. A movie like this one should be mainly fun to watch and shouldn't pretend to be more than that. The movie also lacks a great spectacular finale.

Sigourney Weaver keep's the role of Dana and Rick Moranis continues to give body and talent to the bumbling Mr. Tully. In this film, the company will be re-activated to face a new danger, the evil Lord Vigo (Wilhelm Von Homburg), a medieval warlord who resurfaces in New York with the darkest intentions.As expected, the booming and highly profitable Ghostbuster's quickly spawned a sequel. However, contrary to the bad reputation of this kind of films, this sequel reasonably maintain the level of the previous film, despite being sentenced to didn't become so popular. It's the curse of any sequel to a film that reaches such popularity. In fact, both the technical team and central cast are inherited from the previous film, holding the responsibility very well, although Murray can't have been so funny such we already know how he will behave. In addition to the natural predictability, perhaps the smaller laughter guilt is also the politically correct, a barrier that shouldn't be exceeded in family comedies, but that was tight in this film compared to the first one. In addiction, Peter MacNichol comes in the role of Dr. Janosz Poha, a completely new character that gave a breath of fresh air to the film. Years later, MacNichol will redesign this character in another movie, in Leslie Nielson's company (Dracula Dead and loving it). The special effects continue to be important part of this film, although apparently become more subtle than the first one. The soundtrack is, perhaps, one of the biggest disappointments. Apart from the leitmotiv Ghostbuster's ever popular, it doesn't bring almost nothing remarkable.Although this film suffer from common ailments to most sequels, especially those that were made to resoundingly popular films, it manages to works well and please the majority of the public who saw and liked the first movie.

And I'm sure there were many who didn't take the Ghostbusters sequel too seriously either. But who could blame them back in 1989.Sure it has its issues. The villain's modus operandi has devastating effects, but his method of using a baby's body as a vessel to come back from the dead is played off as silly. Although it doesn't intend to be, it can't help it. The levity of the film is that strong. In this one, all the guys are back and they have to stop the evil Vigo the Carpathian--who is trapped in a painting--from coming back from the dead and ruling the earth. Weird things start happening all over town, as the ghostbusters discover that all of New York City's negative energy has been compiled into slime in the sewer system and is acting as a portal to bring back evil spirits.It isn't easy for them, as they are faced with adversity that doesn't make much sense. They go from being the popular saviors of the city, to all of a sudden no one believing in ghosts anymore.Ultimately, the film lacks any real depth. Character issues are heavily introduced but never resolved in the end. It gets a little lost in that department, sure.But there is a charm that carries over from the original. In fact, I find this one just as funny. The talents are far better utilized here, other than Bill Murray, who is just as good as he is in the last. Peter MacNicol is an especially great addition as the oft-confused foreigner, Dr. Janosz Poha, who curates the art museum where the evil painting is being kept.The first Ghostbusters movie is fantastic. It's legendary. But it shows its age quite a bit. Ghostbusters II may not be as iconic, but it holds up a little better.

In addition, if you're not able to take an underrated supernatural horror flick comedy from the 80's, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Ghostbusters II (1989) is very underrated and hated by so many people and fans of the original movie, including Billy Murray him self. After this movie was released Billy Murray was very disappointed and not happy how the movie turned out. I know this movie is not a comedy like was the first one, it was more dark than the first movie it was scary. Bill Murray had a terrible dialogue in here. Which I understand him, why he is upset over this movie and he said he will never make any Ghostbusters movie ever again. Anyway I enjoyed this movie and like it a lot. I still found some fun moments in it. I don't think it is that good as the original! The original will always kick-ass for me. Unfortunately I don't think, I still have the VHS tape anymore in my video collection. I still and lucky have the original flick on Blu-ray. This is the film that introduced me into becoming a fan of the Ghostbusters and the animated series The real Ghostbusters (1986). I am sorry about a lot of fans been upset and Billy Murray, but still I think he could have made a potential in the third sequel, that Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis come up with! R.I.P. Harold Ramis November 12th, 1944 - February 24, 2014. I respect the actor, he wanted to play one more time Egon Spengler, which I think my favorite character of all time.I was reading the reviews people had left and I think that this was a great movie. Not only did you have the same humor and elements from the first film, you had all the same actors reprise their role. I remember seeing some sequels where some of the good characters weren't back and it was not just as good. I thought the effects were more crisp than the first film as well and I remember this one seemed to creep me out when I was little (see Subway scene). Overall, an excellent film and I will always cherish my proton pack! I think this was more scary than the first one. I remember as a kid I could never get to sleep after watching it. I would always have nightmares of Vigo The Carpathian. I heard Murray crap on it as well which is a shame. This definitely holds up as a solid sequel the same way Wayne's World 2 did.Things I didn't like in this movie I think the bigger problem with the movie is it's kinda a reboot/sequel. They have to get their business back, Peter is trying to get with Danna. I kinda wish they just kept them in business but half of what they make goes to paying off the damage they did at the end of the first one since they got sued. This movie shouldn't have been scary, a baby been kidnapped from the ghost. It should have been a comedy like was the first one, I do agree with Bill Murray about it. Because the first one was not a scary movie, it was funny too and it is my favorite all time flick ever! The movie also has parts that kinda leave you scratching my head saying, WTF were they thinking. The Ghostbusters are forgotten in this movie, the only, only person that does have a heart in this movie n my opinion is Billy Murray. In my opinion Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson did a wonderful job on acting and playing on their respectful characters. I didn't like that Ghostbusters where thrown in to nut house, Vigo throw the baby on the floor, Ray was possessed by Vigo, the bath tub wanted to eat Dana and Oscar. The movie has a plot holes a lot in and too much slimmer and does not make any sense. Sorry guys those are the problems I just don't like in it.Things I like Rick Moranis as Louis Tully I think the actor did a great job, but his role was completely different from the first movie. In the original classic movie he was an accountant, but in this movie he is lawyer who on end of the film transformers him self in to a Ghostbuster and I love that he went there to help his friends to defeat the slime.The courtroom scene is awesome and The Statue of Liberty walking through New York to the tune of Jackie Wilson's Higher and Higher is undoubtedly one of the best scenes in the movie. Despite what people say, the gags in the 2nd film are aplenty. Sure, it wasn't big of a classic as the original film was, but it wasn't that bad! It was very different! It had a new villain that came from a painting, more screen time for Janice and Louis, more funny dialogue, good special effects and a great soundtrack. It was definitely better than it's reputation has gotten from the fans and critics. The movie is good on it is own, but does not beat the original film! 6 out of 10 for me.Ghostbusters II is a 1989 American supernatural horror comedy film, produced and directed by Ivan Reitman.

The damage they did to the city resulted in several lawsuits and the eventual disbanding of the ghostbusters. However, the boys are forced to rally when a 15th century demon named Vigo has targeted Dana Barrett's baby.Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have constructed a viable screenplay which borrows a lot from the first film, but doesn't really rehash and, with the help of Bill Murray's loopy charm as Peter Venkman, make the film feel like a vacation to your hometown where you're catching up with old friends.Sigourney Weaver is again an intelligent damsel in distress and Rick Moranis and Annie Potts provide some giggles as they reprise their roles as Louis and Janine. Also enjoyed David Margulies' return as the mayor, Kurt Fuller as his slimy assistant, and Harris Yulin as a judge with a very short fuse.Though the film provides laughs and the same first rate special effects the first film did, I found it hard to get behind the film because the whole idea of a baby in danger was very unsettling for me and made it hard to fully commit to what happens here. And even though it might be considered nitpicking, I couldn't get past the fact that the Ghostbusters vehicle had the logo for the second film painted on the side and the film does have more endings than necessary, but it is a fairly entertaining ride and as far as sequels go, I've seen a lot worse. I've heard rumblings that plans are in the work to revive this franchise, but without the late Harold Ramis, that would just be wrong.

Venkman is now hosting a show talking to dubious psychics, Spengler is still a scientist, carrying out experiments that some may consider unethical and Stantz and Zeddemore have been reduced to performing in front of unimpressed children. Meanwhile Dana is working at a museum where a painting of Vigo the Carpathian of Moldavia, an evil sixteenth-century ruler. When the pram containing Dana's baby runs out of control and stops in the middle of a busy New York street she suspects evil forces and contacts the Ghostbusters. They dig up the street and discover a river of slime running through a long-disused subway tunnel; slime that feeds on the negative emotions of the city's inhabitants. This isn't their biggest problem though; Vigo is back and he needs a baby for his spirit to inhabit; Dana's baby Oscar. It won't be easy; the team will have to deal with officials at city hall and take control of a New York icon before they are victorious.After the success of the first film a sequel was inevitable; it is just a surprise that it took five years. While I don't think this is as good as the original it is still a lot of fun and it was great to see the characters back again. No time is wasted introducing the characters to it really would be wise to watch the first film before watching this. In some ways it is more of the same; the team must fight against the authorities, New York is invaded by ghosts and Dana is in trouble; although this time it is her child who is in danger rather than her. This isn't too much of a problem as the formula works. The cast do a decent job; not their best work but still solid enough. There are plenty of good laughs to be had throughout the film as well as quite a few child-friendly scares. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the original but don't expect it to be quite as good as that classic.

I decided to give the sequel a chance and while I found it marginally better than the original, there were one or two weaknesses such as the rap song that sounded like a rehash of Ray Parker Jr's 'Ghostbusters' and the proton streams and Dana's television looking outdated for 1989.Despite these flaws, the special effects of the ghosts were very well done and the dialogue was somewhat funnier than that in the original. Standout moments include the Ghostbusters having moved on to different career paths at the beginning, the opening of pink slime oozing out of a crack in the road, a nanny ghost swiping Oscar from Dana and the climax of the Statue of Liberety stomping around New York City with the Ghostbusters sitting inside her crown. Other advantages are the original main cast returning, references to the first film, the music score sounding pleasant to begin with then becoming tense and powerful during scary moments, Rick Moranis's acting being more subtle than his over- acting in the original, the change in Dana becoming a mother and the use of Ray Parker Jr's signature song being better than the rap rehash of it. Overall this is the first sequel that is an improvement over the original since 'Toy Story 3' and it is funnier and more evenly-paced than the original as well. 8/10.

There really wasn't anything that they really needed to add to make the Ghostbusters II fresh and original. So there was no bothering with new material, they just kinda stuck with what worked in the first movie.The other thing is that the first movie was geared towards adults, but in the time between the first and second movie there was the Saturday morning cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters. So in light of that success, there had to be a taming down of the naughtiness that fueled bits of the first movie. Basically they had to make a PG sequel out of a PG13 movie. They also had to, at least to a degree, put the characters of the movie version in line with the characters from the cartoon. I think that if it weren't for the animated series, this movie might never had been made and certainly would not have had much success at all.But if you can deal with both those setbacks, the movie isn't completely terrible by any means. Just mediocre. Bill Murray looks bored throughout, but in an odd sort of way that actually kinda works for Peter Venkmann. Everyone else has fun with the movie, and the foursome are a much more balanced ensemble than the last time (I like that they give Ernie Hudson a little more to work with than the first movie). The whole evil painting scenario is a little ridiculous and as a villain isn't too bothersome, but Peter MacNichol makes a fun and memorable not-quite-so-evil lackey sidekick. For the most part the gags work and baby Oscar is adorable. I loved this movie as a kid and it has those late 80s nuances - like the Bobby Brown theme song - that make it kitsch-y enough to take me back.

As much as I wanted to see some of the same stuff in this second film as I did in the original, I hoped there would be more differences in the sequel than there was. I can't say I was completely disappointed because the same great cast was back at work with the same humor.I hate to see original cast members not reprise their roles in sequels because I think it breaks up the continuity of the cast, so I was glad to see the same cast back for more action. Ghostbusters II was not quite as funny as the first film nor was it quite as dramatic as the first movie, but it was okay because I enjoyed watching Bill Murray and the rest of the gang in action. At the end of this movie, I hoped they would have made a third sequel because I enjoyed the previous two and felt there was more avenues to go. This series still had something to offer.

Some of it is funny, but the quantity and quality of the jokes do not come close to matching the original.One of the criticisms of the first film was that the characters were too cold and mechanical.  This sequel makes the characters more likable and well-rounded, but in so doing, the attitude of the film has been diluted.  A lot of the original film's New York sarcasm and cynicism has been toned down.      Another problem is that the script recycles far too much material from the first film.  Once again, bureaucrats want to shut down the Ghostbusters.  Once again, the Ghostbusters plead their case to the mayor.  Once again, they are incarcerated while ghost activity hits a frenzy.  Once again, there is another big thing that lumbers down the streets of Manhattan.Some have said that the sequel was aimed at a younger audience, since the Ghostbusters cartoon began airing in the five-year period between films.  Still, I felt there was enough potential for the series to continue.  If a third installment ever gets made (unlikely at this point), it would probably get a major overhaul, with new actors and a new location (the Ghostbusters go international, perhaps?).

It has some sparkling dialogue and has improved the special effects, not an easy task. If you liked the original, you will enjoy the sequel. But it is hard to face the facts that the original will be remembered as the classic, no matter how much money Ghostbusters II makes.*Plot* (Maybe Some Spoilers)The story picks up five years after New York city was saved from the evil Gozer by the Ghostbusters. But they were sued by the city for the excessive damages they did and are now starting over. Ray Stanz (Dan Aykroyd) has his own occult bookstore and teams up with Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) to entertain as Ghostbusters at kiddie parties. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) has his own TV show, World of the Psychic, which is completely garbage and disrespected. Only Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) manages to continue working at the university. The trouble starts when Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver), the woman the Ghostbusters saved in the original and Peter's ex-girl, goes to Egon for help when her carriage spins out of control on its own, pushing her young son Oscar (from a previous marriage) through the bustling Manhattan streets. After some investigation, Ray, Egon and Peter find a river of pink slime running under the city. They test it and realize that it is being created by all the negative energy of the city, which it feeds off of. The slime is being harnassed by a sinister maniac named Vigo from hundreds of years ago, represented in a painting at the museum where Dana now works. Soon, ghosts are back running rampant through the city, the slime is overflowing, and Vigo is planning to take human form! Who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!*End of plot*I really enjoyed the first parts of the movie, where it showed what the Ghostbusters had been doing for the last five years. It reintroduced the characters perfectly, which is very important in a sequel. All the actors are back in top form I especially liked that Ray and Egon were more loose in this movie and somewhat less technical. Winston also has more scenes than in Ghostbusters. But some things you shouldn't change Bill Murray is still hilarious as Peter Venkman.However, some characters were reintroduced poorly. The first time we see Janine (Annie Potts) is when she answers the phone at Ghostbusters HQ, announcing that they are back. She also has a new love interest in Louis Tully (Rick Moranis). But in the first film, Janine had a thing for Egon and Louis for Dana. Why is Louis Tully hanging around with the Ghostbusters? The only time he helps them is when he represents them at a trial, if you call that help. Janine had some great scenes in the original, but she has none here. In fact, my favorite scene with her was during the end credits, where she carries off some ghost traps after the boys return from bustin'. It is never explained what she or Louis did during the five year abcense of the Ghostbusters.The plot is actually a little bit more focused than the original, which was more of how the Ghostbusters got in business and less about Dana's problems (until later). The sequel keeps things focused on the slime, Vigo and only lets slip a little with Dana and Peter's romance. Thats another thing I had trouble with in the beginnning, Dana says to Egon that she would prefer that Peter would be left out of the investigation into the carriage phenomenon. But when he gets involved, Dana seems too easy she initiates the first moves when she and Peter go out to dinner (which she agrees to quite quickly). Considering the way she describes her relationship with Peter directly after the events in Ghostbusters, this seems quite suspicious. But getting back to the plot, it is more focused, but a little rediculous. Its fun to see the Ghostbusters have fun testing out the mood slime, but later, *SPOILER* when they spread the mood slime all around the Statue of Liberty and have it parade down Broadway using the positive energy of the New Year's Eve crowd, it gets a little silly. *END SPOILER*It can't quite match the original scene for scene. The first film had classic scene after classic scene. While the sequel has a few good ones like the trial and testing the slime, the scenes underground when Ray, Egon and Winston are searching for the source of the slime is quite poor, along with the Dana and Peter dinner scene. It doesn't help that these two are intercut.But lets get down to the good parts. The movie still has the classic one-liners or t-shirt lines that the original had. Peter is still given the best dialogue, but the banter between all of the Ghostbusters is quite good, especially Egon and Ray. The special effects are improved from the first, whose were excellent. Again, the writers (Aykroyd and Ramis) and director (Ivan Rietman) make you believe in the outlining premise of ghosts in Manhattan. You may question the details of the story but the world that is created is very believable.In closing, the film is not as scary as the first, even though that was not very frightening to begin with. Also, kudos to Peter MacNicol for his funny performance and great speech and mannerisms.For Ghostbusters fans, this is a must see. For others, see the original and then make up your minds wheter or not you would like Ghostbusters II. The film had the bad sense to open one weekend before the box-office champ of 1989, Batman. With a great box-office intake of $112.5 million (but poor compared to the original film's $238.6 million in recipts) and 11 years past, it is unlikely that Ghostbusters III will ever come to pass, although Aykroyd says he is working on a script. But who knows? Harrison Ford is gunning to make Indiana Jones IV at age 58 and 11 years after the last entry.In any case, enjoy.

Winston has always been my favorite Ghostbuster and for good reason too.  He's not a scientist like the other three, but a working class individual that I can, as well as other people can, identify with.My other problem was with how slow the movie started.  There was not any action until about 40 minutes in the movie.  The time before this was just implications and suspense building.  That is all good, but for forty minutes?  It becomes tiring.

As well as spawning a hit cartoon series, this sequel was made five years later.  The plot, in its basics, is simply a remake of the original.  But this one, whilst never quite capturing the grand feel of the first movie, is slicker, funnier and scarier than the first movie.  Even the soundtrack is on a par with the first one.The Ghostbusters are now unemployed having been sued into bankruptcy after their adventures in the first film.  Their leader, Peter Venkman(Bill Murray) is now fronting a chat show programme called World of the Psychic, science boffin Egon Spengler(Harold Ramis) has returned to University where he continues his research, Raymond Stantz (Dan Ackroyd) runs an occult bookstore whilst entertaining kids at parties with fellow Ghostbusting chum Winston Zeddemore(Ernie Hudson).Meanwhile Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver), the woman they saved from demonic possession first time round, is now a single mother and working at an art museum, where again she becomes the target of unwanted supernatural forces, this time from the ghost of a haunted painting who wants to possess her baby.  That and a river of slime flowing beneath New York see the return of the Ghostbusters.The plot contains alot of engrossing set pieces the pre-credits sequence featuring Weaver's baby in a runaway pram, a courtroom face-off between the Ghostbusters and a pair of demonic ex-cons, an eerie sequence set in spooky subway tunnels, the crowd-pleasing scene with a walking Statue of Liberty and the gloriously messy final showdown.There is plenty of fun and frolics to be found here and, in addition to the above characters, Annie Potts and Rick Moranis return in their respective roles as overworked secretary Janine and nerd Louis Tully, who now works alongside Janine as an accountant for the Ghostbusters.  An odd and funny romance develops between the pair.  Also returning is Slimer, the green ghost who slimed Venkman who gets a few brief but funny scenes.One of the interesting differences between this and the first film as whereas the acting in Ghostbusters was very subtle and laid back, here nearly everyone is quite happy to play it more over-the-top and they seem to be enjoying themselves more as a result.This can well be said for the newcomers to the series.  Kurt Fuller plays the weaselly, disbelieving Mayor's aide, the team's political adversary who tries to have them committed.  Harris Yulin has a wonderful turn as a nasty courtroom judge and Wilhelm Von Homburg makes a much more frightening villain with his bulging eyes and harsh, booming voice.  Also on hand is Peter MacNicol as the museums curator, with an effeminate manner and sporting a strange, untraceable foreign accent.With the baby around, the love scenes between Murray and Weaver are alot more tender and less sleazy this time.  As a result both actors take a more sympathetic approach to their roles.The effects department have gone into slime-overload for this film the stuff is literally everywhere (the 'Busters even use it as a weapon in the film's final scenes).  There is also plenty of good music to enjoy with a moody soundtrack from Randy Edelman and songs from Oingo-Bongo and first-film theme-master Ray Parker Jr.Together the two movies comprise one the best film franchises of the Eighties.  It's a pity the much-promised third film now looks like it may never come to fruition.

It has a different style and flair from the original, which isn't a bad thing.  In fact, it benefits the film in many positive ways.  The only gripe I have is the music score continuity.  Elmer Bernstein's score for the first film fit Ghostbusters to a tee.  I was sorry to see his contributions missing in the sequel.  I see he has two other selections for the year 1989.  I can only assume he wasn't available.  This really is a minor gripe, especially since Randy Edelman provided a fine score for the film anyway.  That said, I again throw in my nod to director Ivan Reitman and his remarkable cast & crew for making us scream and laugh at the supernatural one more time.  Fantastic followup.  I can only remark how much this film makes me yearn for a third outing.  Unfortunately, it appears things aren't looking too well for getting the ball rolling on it.Mr. Aykroyd, you've got this fan's support.  For what it's worth, I would love to see Ghostbusters III.  I sincerely hope you can find some way to cut through the red tape.  This is a great film series.  It deserves another addition.

As much as I wanted to see some of the same stuff as I did in the original, I hoped there would be more differences in the sequel than there was. To that extent I was disappointed.  However, with that said, I can't say I was completely disappointed because the same great cast was back at work with the same humor.I hate to see original cast members not reprise their roles in sequels because I think it breaks up the continuity of the cast, so I was glad to see the same cast back for more action. Ghostbusters II was not quite as funny as the first film nor was it quite as dramatic as the first movie, but it was okay because I enjoyed watching Bill Murray and the rest of the gang in action. At the end of this movie, I hoped they would have made a third sequel because I enjoyed the previous two and felt there was more avenues to go. This series still had something to offer. I was sad to see that the series had only two movies.I suggest that everyone check this film out at their local video store for a night of laughs and fun.

And even with the reputation most sequels have (at least nowadays, when they are cranked out with the soulless annual consistency of the Saw films), I think everyone expected something a lot better than what they got. As an 8-year old kid weaned on episodes of The Real Ghostbusters 6 days a week, and an ardent fan of the original film, I wasn't doing any complaining in my local theater back in '89; and I'd be lying if I said it didn't have a special place in my childhood.But after nearly two decades of depreciation, Ghostbusters II, well, just looks plain inferior to its predecessor. While making an earnest attempt to be an authentic sequel (catching up with the boys 5 years after their duel with Gozer), the film is afflicted with several missteps that smack of desperation 1) the inclusion of a weird-accented gallery owner (Peter MacNicol--Bean); 2) the expansion of Rick Moranis's gawky accountant character; 3) the placement of a child in peril (in this case, Dana Barret's infant); and 4) an 'up-with-people' theme that feels more than a little silly.Granted, the film has Ivan Reitman's assured direction, Richard Edlund's superb FX work, and the presence of the original cast on its side. There are, as in the original, some comedically inspired sequences Ray, Peter, and Egon doing a construction-worker shtick; a courtroom scene presided over by the bellowing Harris Yulin; and the Statue of Liberty walking through downtown New York, powered by an old NES controller.As for the plot a portrait of a Carpathian ruler named Vigo takes possession of MacNicol in order to obtain a child so that he can be reincarnated on New Year's Eve. And while the original Ghostbusters had a plot that was just as--if not more--ridiculous, we went along with it anyway, because the flipside-world presented on screen was so damn convincing (as were the performances). In this sequel, we are constantly snorting in full awareness of how damn ridiculous it is. The writing, insofar as comedy and plot is concerned, is regrettably slack and underwhelming (and isn't helped by the high standard the original set).I don't know...there are good things in Ghostbusters II. It has a great cast (Bill Murray's delivery is always good for a few chuckles), the visuals are still cool, and it gives purists some candy to chew while holding vigil for Ghostbusters 3 to be greenlit. If you're like me, it will coast along on nostalgia value alone--a quality diversion that won't leave much of an impression.

The sequel has its moments but not nearly enough of them and it leaves you with the sense that you've seen all this done before and done better. There's really nothing new or compelling here. Same premise. Ghosts in New York City, Ghostbusters called in to deal with the problem. Been there, done that.All the principal characters from the first film are back and we pretty much just start all over again. At the start of the sequel the Ghostbusters are out of business but they will soon find themselves back in action battling, I kid you not, a river of pink slime oozing beneath the streets of Manhattan and a ghost trapped in a painting. The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man it isn't. Anyhow this pink slime and our not-so-friendly painting ghost get their power from the negative energy in New York City. If people would all just be happy everything will turn out just fine! The heck with blasting ghosts, let's just have a contrived musical number and make all the New Yorkers sing and then everything will be great. Hoo boy. Can't we just go back to blasting things? Please?There are a few good comic moments here with Bill Murray again providing most of the highlights. Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, Weaver, Moranis...they're all back and their performances are fine. It's just a shame they didn't have a better story to work with. All the charm and originality of the first movie is missing in this paint-by-numbers sequel. After the success of the first movie a sequel was inevitable.

The success of the original and the cartoons series must have had a push in this.  Rick Moranis is wasted from being a real person in the original (that might be a stretching description) to a poor sap delivering some of the worst one-liners in history.  Harold Ramis is a parody of himself in the original, remember how humorless he was?

For one, the tone is all over the place; the humor seems written mostly for kids, while some of the scenes are downright creepy (sometimes more so than the first movie). Meanwhile, the story repeats the same formula of the original, the bad guy needing an infant doesn't make sense (wouldn't he need an adult human, instead?), inconsistent costume upgrades, and odd character quirks. Like I said, nitpicking. And if taken far enough, said picker could easily be grouped with the hater category (whatever that means). But I like this movie. It remains a highlight of the mythic Summer of '89, and it holds up pretty well. As a Ghostbusters movie, it's pretty flippin' watchable, with genuinely funny lines and some cool ghost-busting effects. It really is a thrill to see these guys suit up again.

While it seems trendy these days to mock this film (Bill Murray hates it, but I don't see why; he gets a fair bit of screen time) it's certainly no worse, and a lot better, than similar modern fare.The film has two ingredients that help it entertain the cast, and the supernatural elements. Cast-wise, all the big-hitters are back Ramis, Ackroyd, Hudson, Murray, Weaver, Moranis and Potts. They share a good camaraderie, and lots of funny quips and one-liners. Nothing to dislike here.Secondly, the ghostly stuff. The river of sentient slime flowing through the sewers is a FANTASTIC idea; I only wish they'd made more of it. Vigo isn't as an imposing a villain as in the first film, but he's not bad, and there are some good effects of his forehead bulging from the canvas. Okay, so Peter MacNicol is awful, and there's a slightly rushed/shoddy feel to the last third of the film, but for the most part I liked this one...not loved it, like the first, but liked it well enough.

It was a roller coaster of charm, thrills and wit for all ages. Following the film there were plans to make it a TV series, but the funding simply wasn't there. Instead it was made into a series of animated series aimed for the kiddie audience that about half of the movie was intended for. Mind you the animated series was respectively dark for its time and in order to bring more humor into the series, the producers brought in a comical sidekick in the form of one of the Ghost Buster's first spectral nemeses. A ghost referred to behind the scenes as Onionhead, but would come to be known as the gluttonous Slimer.In many ways Slimer represents the nature of favoring marketing over substance. he was R2D2 without the subtlety and about half as useful. Fortunately the writers of the sequel foresaw this issue and he only makes two useless cameos in the film and never completely embarrasses the film by making it interact with the main characters.Unfortunately the taint of marketing over substance didn't end with Slimer. The majority of the film is seasoned with similar laziness. The main characters are reduced in the very beginning to underdogs again instead of the heroes they were at the end of the first film. This eventually leads to a redemption scene in which the antagonist is a despotic judge who for some bizarre reason chooses not believe in ghosts, despite the fact that a 50 ft giant ghost was captured on live television during the climactic battle of the first film only five years ago.Also returning is Dana Barret who plays the mother of the impending victim, Oscar. In the original film, Dana was a victim because she simply lived in the wrong apartment complex. Now her baby is the impending victim because... he's cute? I have my own personal issues with the use of babies or young children as plot devices because it eliminates any real drama. Nothing ever happens to these kids (Hollywood wouldn't dare risk it) and so no legitimate dramatic tension can be established by placing them in harm's way. I'll get into the laziness of Oscar's character a little later. Dana portrays Peter's love interest again, because it would have made too much sense for them to simply still be together after the events of the first film and her character is just a little too well-adjusted for someone whose baby daddy just left her with a newborn for a job in Europe.Slightly less lazy is the return of Louis Tully and his new love interest, Janine Melnitz, whose character is disappointingly reduced to a sexually aggressive caricature. While the chemistry between the two isn't entirely absent, Annie Potts' character was better in the first film as a snarkier assistant at odds with her employers and a thing for intellectuals. Louis Tully is Louis Tully, but unfortunately for Rick Moranis, his character role this time around is downgraded by the two aforementioned cameos with Slimer.The meat and potatoes of the plot is established with the introduction of Vigo the Carpathian. A despotic sorcerer and tyrant whose spirit exists in a painting bearing his likeness. His main weapons of choice are a Renfield-like servant who is given vague supernatural abilities and is only slightly less annoying than Andy Dick and a powerful, spiritually charged sludge that manifests and feeds on negative emotions. The latter would have had a better execution if they had come up with a better solution to dealing with it other than happy, cheerful slime and serving the oldest possible cliché of objectified good versus objectified evil. Vigo's plan is to take over the world (Of Course!) and in order to do so he needs to possess a human body and that someone is baby Oscar.This leads us to the true laziness of using a baby for a plot device. Oscar's character is entirely unnecessary except to serve as a springboard to bring Dana and Peter back together because we need to revisit this relationship from the first film. Also, it is obvious that Vigo intends to begin his reign from very beginning and yet he favors a host that would be relatively defenseless and lacking in basic communication abilities. It is also seen through his actions that he could possess practically any other human so the question begs why not choose any older child in New York City from ages 8-13 instead of learning how to walk, talk, feed yourself and use a toilet all over again.Plot and general character laziness aside, the effects are decent but the music lacks the pop of the 'original' score from Ray Parker Jr (with my own respects to Huey Lewis and the News). Perhaps hip hop was not the way to go with this film.Despite its flaws, its still a very watchable and moderately enjoyable film. It still manages to produce some genuinely creepy and funny moments which is what a Ghostbusters movie should have and it was nice to see Ernie Hudson's Winston Zeddemore do more in the film than be a stand-in fourth and the main four characters are still true to form. Its definitely worth a watch or two.

To me, this movie wasn't really like a sequel. It was like Columbia Pictures decided to reinvent Ghost Busters (1984) by changing the visuals. Yes there are different things in the plot, for example, it's set five years later, Sigourney Weaver's character has a baby, and the Ghost Busters have to restore their names to New York by saving the city like they did five years before. But none of these minor changes made me feel like I was watching anything new.For the cast of this movie, all the same the actors reprise their roles. That is a good thing, because replacing actors for the same character doesn't end well most of the time; but this is not the case. You would think though the writers to this film would do something extraordinary with the characters, but no. Instead we seem to get a rehash from the first film. I enjoyed the original Ghost Busters to a point. It was funny but I did not think it was AS funny as everyone claimed it to be.As for the special effects, I felt that director Ivan Reitman had an ambitious concept and used it well. Although it still did not raise my interest of the movie to a higher level, it definitely kept me paying attention to what was happening on screen. Much of the effects in this movie deal with slime. Watching the slime ooze and sludge all over town reminded me of The Blob (1988), but in a less graphic sense. I'm curious if Dan Aykroyd borrowed this idea from that movie. I would like to know how they even cleaned the mess up. I can't tell which would have been more difficult; cleaning the mess in the first movie with the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, or the slime. I'd pick the marshmallow, at least you can eat that.Finally, the parts in the movie that were supposed to be funny did make me laugh, but still, not enough. And although I cannot count exactly how many times I chuckled, it felt like the same amount of times as I did for the first film. It still was funny but I was hoping Ghost Busters II would have turned my opinion around on the first one. Instead, it left me in the same vicinity as the first one. I did like the musical score in this film. I might've even liked it more than Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack from the Ghost Busters (1984). I really can't explain why but it has a different feeling than the one before. In the end, Ghost Busters II was not two hours wasted, but it could have been done better.Ghost Busters II will satisfy fans of the franchise but it's almost too close to the original. All the original characters are back, but it seems like nothing new was added; besides more slime.

It's fairly amusing and likable in its own right, but given the gonzo comedy minds behind it, uncomfortably safe and commercially-focused.Five years after the events of Ghostbusters, our intrepid team of spook-chasers have moved on. But when a 16th-century Carpathian tyrant tries to take up residence in the infant son of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), it's time for them to reunite and save Manhattan once again.It's really a reunion, too, with all of the Ghostbusters back from the first film, along with Weaver, Annie Potts, and Rick Moranis as uber-nerd Louis Tully, now over his dog-like infatuation for Dana. Director Ivan Reitman plays to the crowd more than he did in the first film, with flashing lights and goofy scare scenes. Even Slimer, the ever-hungry poltergeist, is back for a couple of cameos.What matters most is that Bill Murray is back as Venkman, the smug and wisecracking Ghostbuster still pining for Dana. Murray's fastball was as sharp as anyone's in film comedy at the time, and if he overplays his ironic detachment, he also throws off killer facial gestures or line readings with ridiculous ease.Don't put any of those old, cheap moves on me, Dana tells him.No, no, no, he assures her. I've got all new cheap moves.Venkman was also the prime focus of the last film, but not so much as he is here. With more special effects to deliver, more nods in the direction of merchandising (the ghost in the familiar logo now holds up two fingers), and a concerted effort at giving Ernie Hudson something to do other than be black, the scripters cut way back on Ghostbusters Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), defined roles in the first film but offering only exposition here. Since Ramis and Aykroyd were the screenwriters, I guess it was an easy call.The only scene not showcasing Murray, and the best in the film, has the Ghostbusters on trial and represented by Tully, who hilariously shows how wrong he is for the job. As a comely prosecutor played by Janet Margolin in one of her last film roles runs circles around him, Tully whines Give me a break. We're both lawyers.I laughed more in that scene than I did with any scene in the first movie. But the film's plot, once established, is a strained retread of the first movie, complete with the Statue of Liberty subbing for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. The special effects don't hold up well, a real failing for such an FX-driven feature.Was Ghostbusters II designed for the kids, for the merchandising, or both? It delivers plenty of Murray at close to his funniest, and stitches together enough good lines to keep me amused. But it never risks rocking the boat, and its efforts to reference He-Man and rap music are weak stabs at relevance that date the film today. (Exception Bobby Brown's On Our Own is a terrific improvement on the tone-deaf Ghostbusters theme.)If only Aykroyd and Ramis were inspired to use their comedy brilliance to dig a little deeper, the result could have been a Gremlins 2 or Evil Dead II-style improvement on the original. Alas, while entertaining, a paint-by-numbers feel predominates.

There were some successes which were both critical and financial, like the Indiana Jones and Back to the Future series. Seeing that Ghostbusters was on of the best loved films of the 80s and forming a spin-off cartoon then a sequel was inevitable.Five years after the first film the Ghostbusters had gone out of business after being sued by the city and state of New York. The gang had gone their separate ways. But there are called back into action after a threat emerges to Dian Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and her young son.

The also investigate the smile and the possible link to a strange painting in the New York Museum of Art.The first film was a classic to generations, the sequel is a decent effort, but nothing compared to the first film. Bill Murray and Harold Ramis still do a good comic job, particularly Murray and the director Ivan Reitman offers a steady hand behind the camera. The special effects were brilliant and storywises, there are worst and it does offer a commentary of New Yorkers. But what happens is this film falls into 2 traps. The first was going for easier visual and slapstick which was avoided in the first film. Bill Murray tries to keep his deadpan humour, but the film isn't as the first film. The second is the trap most comedy sequels fall into, repleting some of the same gags and scenes from the previous films. It shows a lack of originality.If you seen the first film you may as well watch it, but it's not as good as the first.

In both he's a hypnotized slave of the big bad guy- the difference being that here, he has a German accent or something.Alas, I have to agree with some of the other user comments that this isn't the only reason for déjà vu- Ghostbusters II is closely modelled after the original. There's another song indicating the ghostbusters are in demand; there's another jerk from the government giving them grief; they're arrested again; there's another apocalypse; they're New Yorkers' heroes again. Add to that some cheap repetition of the line Who you gonna call? and it starts to look not good.But wait, there are some honest laughs. Early on, we have a woman on Venkman's talk show talking about an alien she met- obviously a joke of a guest. There are more ghosts, and the Titanic finally makes it to New York. Winston has a bigger part ('cause he wasn't introduced half way into the movie this time). Finally, we have the villain- not a Sumerian god/goddess. This time it's a dead European tyrant named Vigo who lives in a painting of himself, wanting to escape by taking possession of a baby.

I too am a bit puzzled why the writers/producers didn't explain why Janine (Annie Potts),no longer loves Egon (Harold Ramis),and instead is in love with Louis (Rick Moranis) in this one.What happened there,did they (Egon and Janine) break-up or have a falling-out,or something? I do love the addition of some of the other characters,from Janosz Poha and Jack Hardemeyer to Dana's baby,little Oscar (who was simply adorable, especially in those yellow Winnie-the-Pooh footsie blanket sleeper pajamas he wore at the end of the movie.I had a pair when I was 4 years old myself).Of course,you have your usual ghostly encounters, the main evil,out-for-world-domination ghost,this time Vigo replaces Gozer,which wants to possess little Oscar so he can live again to conquer the world,and the ghost-busters must help Dana to get little Oscar back from Vigo's evil clutches,with the help of Lady Liberty.Of course,we also have the mayor's assistant that wants the Ghost-busters put out of business,permanently,even going as far as having them hauled off in strait-jackets to the loony-bin.Of course,the mayor has the boys released from the nut-house and the boys come to Dana and Oscar's rescue,as you might expect.I like also when the ghost-busters try to convince the mayor about what's going on with the pink 'mood' slime,the mayor says another funny,memorable line, Being miserable and treating other people like garbage is every New Yorker's God-given right........,before Hardemeyer fools the ghost-busters into being hauled off to the funny-farm.Overall,I think this was a fun movie to watch,especially if you loved the first movie and I really liked the funny one-liners some of the characters said and the premise of the evil,tyrannical tyrant from 500 years ago coming back to try to take over the world and how the ghost-busters must band-together to help their friend,and Peter's (Bill Murray's) old flame,Dana Barrett and her baby get away from the evil Vigo's clutches before he possesses Oscar's body and eventually takes over the world (once he gets out of his diapers and goes through puberty LOL),so overall I give this film a rating of 7 out of 10 stars,and I also agree with some of you,it'd be a shame if they never come out with a second sequel to this entertaining movie series.

I liked the part when the slime erupted into chaos on the streets of New York, with ghosts and dinosaurs chasing everyone around, though that part could have been much better. It would have been great to see more, like park benches chasing people, trees in Central Park turning alive and mad, cars driving away from the monsters and crashing into trees that hit back (like the Whomping Willow in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). Also would have been cool to see clawed hands popping up out of every sewer hole in the streets and whipping at people in the streets and on the sidewalks. And the more people misbehave, the worse the chaos becomes. Bet that'll change New York City people's attitudes! Although I have to admit that I have been to New York City recently and apparently noticed that New Yorkers are not as rude as I thought.

They are reunited when Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver reprising her role from the original) is once again plagued by the dead. At this point, it begins to seem that her role in life is that of supernatural punching bag, or maybe the ghosts have had the hots for her since seeing her in Alien.Ghostbusters II captures the same humor and fun as its predecessor and brings back all of the major players as well. It is great to see Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson together again. Peter MacNicol is brought on as the lackey for the ancient evil spirit bent on resurrection, providing some great comic moments. The only problem is that at points it feels too much like the first, as if it reuses some of the same jokes and situations. Fortunately, the movie never feels stale and still makes for an entertaining two hours. I'd even go so far as to say I like this one a little better than the first. It's a shame they never made a third, but, in a way, I am glad they didn't. By stopping after II, they gave the series a nice close and avoided over-killing the franchise.

What film wouldn't have trouble emerging from the wake of the original Ghostbusters. I was watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory the other day, more specifically the episode where they find an original draft screenplay of Ghostbusters 2 and toss it away when they find out that it is Ghostbusters 2 instead of the original. This struck an angry nerve in me because I adore both films equally. This film is just as hilarious and just as well written, but it has one thing the original didn't have...a heartfelt and important message.The story (for anyone that hasn't already seen it) concerns our heroes getting back into business after a 5 year hiatus following the lawsuits that were brought on by the incidents of the first film. They quickly don their gear again for another round of hilarity, fantasy and adventure. The cast are again on superb form and the fantastic chemistry between the main heroes is still there. The main enemy that the ghostbusters face is an historical and mystical figure trapped inside a painting at a New York art museum. This villain's wrongdoings coincide with the existence of a river of mood-slime flowing in the sewers beneath the city, which is where the important message comes in.Unlike the previous film, this film provides an important message that acts of human decency and generally being a good person can indeed save the world, which is true to some extent and this is elevated to fantastic proportions when the ghostbusters use the mood slime to literally transport Lady Liberty to the museum and destroy the mood slime surrounding it by inspiring countless New Yorkers. This might seem a bit convoluted but watch the film for yourself and you'll see how everything comes together. I would even say that the statue of liberty scene even rivals that of the marshmallow man scene from the first film and is elevated excellently by the song that is used.Ignore the reviews surrounding this sequel because rest-assured, it is just as funny, just as exciting and inspires you in a way that the original never did.

It still stands out as one of the best films overall and one I would watch over and over again.Five years after the events of the first film, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd, Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) have been plagued by lawsuits and court orders, bankrupting their Ghostbusters business. After Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) witnesses an unseen paranormal force and goblins start to form from a river of ectoplasmic slime beneath the city, the citizens rely on the Ghostbusters again, getting themselves back in business. Mixed in with this new horror is the evil spirit of an ancient sorcerer, which comes alive from a self-portrait on display at Dana's museum; the spirit wants to possess Dana's baby and be reborn into the world, spreading his work of terror.All the supernatural aspects in this film are brilliantly displayed, generating creepy moments to the audience. I've always thought that the mean-looking self-portrait of the sorcerer, with its eyes following Dana wherever she goes, could send chills down your spine. I just wished the filmmakers could have let the origin of the portrait remain unknown during the first part of the movie and let the tension built-up, rather than revealing it as a ghost so early in the film. The special effects for the ghosts were again nicely done. Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis did another great job on the story - exciting, adventurous and humorous. And, Ivan Reitman did another great job in the director's chair, providing us with a movie with a solid, fast-paced and exciting plot. The subplot about Dana and her baby was blended in very well with the story.Composer Randy Edelman provided a catchy music score. One of the scenes that I thought was memorably done is when secretary Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts), in her first appearance in the movie, answers the first phone call about a ghost on the loose, with the Ghostbusters music theme playing the background.Overall, like it's prequel, a great movie overall and one of the best movie sequels out there.Grade A "},{"Title":"An Excellent,Underrated Sequel.","Date":"22 January 2013","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Sci-Fi","Review":" Ghostbusters II is an excellent,underrated sequel that once again that combines great laughs,supernatural thrills,wonderful special effects and well-written dialog.

But now with Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver) in trouble with ghosts again,the Ghostbusters have to revive their business to not only deal with Ghosts,but a new villain named Vigo(Wilhelm Von Homburg,voiced by Max Von Sydow)and a pink mood slime that feeds on negative energy of the city and the Ghostbusters are the only ones to do something about it and when there's something strange in the neighborhood who you're gonna call? I honestly don't know or have any idea why GBII has a mixed reception with most Ghostbusters fans and film critics,although the film made money at the Box Office some fans and critics felt GBII didn't live up to the first film but I have always loved this movie and I think it's very underrated. The reasons why I love GBII and why it works is because it's a great sequel,the characters,the screenplay and the special effects. Doing a sequel can be a tricky thing especially when you do a sequel to a beloved classic like Ghostbusters,but director Ivan Reitman and co-writers/co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and Bill Murray manage to pull off a great sequel that I don't think was trying to top the first film,but do a sequel with things that made the first film work. Like the first film,this film greatly balances Comedy and Supernatural terror with laughs that are funny either because of the characters or the situations the characters go through or the dialog. When the supernatural element of the film comes into play the tone and eerie atmosphere of GBII is scary and is up there with the first in terms of matching the spookiness and creepiness and will have images that will frighten you and also make you laugh your head off. I guess with moviegoers a sequel is going to be good or bad,the sequel is going to be like the first film or different from the first film,it's a damned if do,damned if you don't situation and some have said that GBII is a rehash of the first film I can say yes and no to that argument. Yes because GBII has the same characters and a few scenes similar to the first and no because of the story involving pink mood slime and people's negative emotions making the slime is very creative and the villain Vigo is a great antagonist for the Ghostbusters and compared with most sequels that have came out since GBII in which some are done for a quick cash grab at the Box Office,this sequel is pretty creative and done with heart and great imagination. The main characters in GBII Peter,Ray,Egon and Winston like the first film are likable and funny showing the Ghostbusters and how they've dealt with being out of work and of business and how they make a comeback and are accepted again by the city after five years almost like nothing had ever happened in the first film. The screenplay written once again by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is well-written and funny with great scenes and dialog and creative moments and while the lines,quotes and dialog in this film isn't as memorable or classic like the first(the dialog lacks the grown up edge of the first and was toned down because of the kids and the popularity of the cartoon The Real Ghostbusters),GBII still has a solid screenplay. The Action scenes in the film are great and thrilling mixing suspense and great laughs that will have viewers smiling The special effects in the film are outstanding and wonderful and still hold up to this very day,whether it's the creepy ghosts,the proton packs or the pink mood slime. Every big budget blockbuster seems to always have that real big effects shot where the filmmakers put all of their money into the big effects shot and like the first GB,the big shot at the end of this film is big and not only is it big,it's awe-inspiring,jaw-dropping and unforgettable.The cast does a great job. Bill Murray(Peter),Dan Aykroyd(Ray),Harold Ramis(Egon)and Ernie Hudson(Winston)are excellent and hilarious once again as The Ghostbusters. Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as Dana,Peter's love interest and Weaver has a great chemistry with Murray. Rick Moranis is hilarious as Louis who is now the Ghostbusters lawyer and accountant. Annie Potts fantastic once again as Janine,the Ghostbusters secretary and has great scenes with Moranis. Wilhelm Von Homburg is creepy as Vigo,a guy who wants to rule the world. Peter MacNicol is delightfully fun and over the top as Janosz,a painter who helps Vigo. Harris Yulin(Judge The Hammer Wexler),David Margulies(Mayor Lenny),Kurt Fuller(Jack)and Janet Margolin(The Prosecutor) give fun performances as well.The direction by Ivan Reitman is excellent,brining a lot of energy and style to the film and does a wonderful job mixing Comedy and the Supernatural. Great direction,Ivan.The score by Randy Edelman is wonderful,light,effective and at times eerie and fits with the film's tone. Great score. The soundtrack also has great songs mostly Hip-Hop tracks by Run-Dmc(Ghostbusters)Bobby Brown(On Our Own and We're Back Bobby Brown also makes a cameo in the film),Doug E.Fresh and The Great Fresh Crew(Spirit),Glenn Frey(Flip City),a wonderful return of the original Ghostbusters theme by Ray Parker Jr and a great use of the classic Higher and Higher by Jackie Wilson.

Many people have commented on this movie and always say that it's underrated and that couldn't be any more true. What other movie has the Statue of Liberty coming to life and a painting of a sixteenth century king as the villain. I have done extensive study and i have finally figured out why this movie isn't treated the way it should be. Ghostbusters II was released on June 16, 1989, one week before a little movie called BATMAN came out and became a world wide phenomenon. A little known fact is that Ghostbusters II set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend in cinema history, only for it to be crushed a week later by Batman. The impact and success of Batman left Ghostbusters II forgotten and unloved, grossing 112 million dollars next to Batman's 251 million. Now that iv'e explained the reason why it's underrated, now it's time to talk about the movie.Ghostbusters II is about the group five years later since defeating Gozer and were sued into going out of business. Ray and Winston now run a occult book store and appear at children's birthday parties, Egon is now a researcher at The Institue for Advanced Theoretical Reaserch, and Peter is now the host of a TV show. Dana now works at a art museum and had a child after breaking up with Peter. A coworker of hers named Janosz is restoring the painting of a 16th century ruler named Vigo one night when it comes to life and tells him to bring him a child so he can be resurrected. Meanwhile, Peter, Egon, and Ray discover a river of slime under the city streets and are arrested and trailed for illegal drilling in public. But two ghost appear and attack the courtroom but the ghostbusters save them and are back in business.I once saw a interview Director Renny Harlin did for Die Hard 2 and said that to make a good sequel you have to be more original and inventive then the predecessor. He is 100% correct, Ghostbusters II is more inventive and original the the first, a river of slime that can be used for good or bad depending on if it absorbs positive or negative energy, a painting of a 16th century king coming to life and trying to resurrect himself through a infant, making the Statue of Liberty come to life with positively charged slime and a NES Advantage controller. All of the actors are at the top of their game and the special effects are top notch. One thing that has always bothered me is that Winston seems to disappear and reappear through the film, in the beginning we see him with Ray at the birthday in full uniform then when the rest join in to drill under the street and are on trail he's nowhere to be found but when their back in business he's suddenly back again. Another thing that bothered me is that when the Ghostbusters are in the museum fighting Vigo, Louis just grabs a suit out of a closet (like they had it their in case they wanted his help) and takes a bus to the museum that Slimer is driving. A ghost is driving the bus and his dumbass just gets on like it's ordinary for a ghost to drive a bus.The best part of the movie is when the Ghostbusters make the Statue of Liberty come to life to get New York's positive energy flowing. Has their ever been a scene in film history like that before or after Ghostbusters II, NO! The Ghostbusters also don't just use proton packs here, they take the slime they've collected and make slime packs to use against Vigo along with their Proton Packs. After seeing this movie i wanted to see Ghostbusters III, there was room left open for a third movie. At the end Louis becomes a member of the Ghostbusters so why not do a third showing him with the team. As time went along i eventually wised up and decided that there shouldn't be another sequel, the movies are fine the way they are and the series should be left alone.Ghostbusters II is a great movie and is very underrated, you should go buy this movie as soon as possible and watch it.

There is still the disbelieving mayor, the suit who wants the Ghostbusters discredited, and some bad quasi-rap songs. Despite this, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are still quite good with Murray bringing most of the good one-liners. There is always room for Bill Murray. The best reason to give this one a look is Peter MacNicol, who comes in as one of those men with the indistinguishable accent. Says Murray, Hey Johnny, where do you come from? MacNicol replies, The upper west side. While it may not be as cool as a rampaging marshmallow man, it's still a blast to see the Statue of Liberty walking the streets of New York to Jackie Wilson's Higher and Higher. If you liked the original, this is more of the same, but it's pretty good same.

I felt that the sets were warm and inviting, the lighting friendly. This is of course in stark contrast to the river of slime scenes, and the underground railway.

The first, made in 1984, which had introduced to filmgoing audiences somewhat orthodox scientists and a parapsychologist who seize upon getting their grant revoked for study on Columbia University's campus to go into business for themselves as well, the guys you call when you have a paranormal pest problem to be taken care of. It continues to be an everlasting staple of pop culture, especially of 80s pop culture. And the sequel that followed, released five years later, did much to keep up with the humor.We return five years to New York to find that the Ghostbusters business is defunct, thanks to numerous lawsuits that had ensued after the four guys combated the massive evil of the underworld and basically saved New York City. Ray (Akroyd) runs a bookstore when he's not performing as a Ghostbuster with Winston (Hudson) at birthday parties, Egon (Ramis) is doing human tests (that oddly, would not likely pass and IRB review) of some sort, and Peter (Murray) has a cable access show on the paranormal and more. Dana (Weaver) brings the group together again after an incident on the streets of the city with a runaway baby carriage reveal a river of paranormal slime flowing underground in an abandoned train tunnel. Oddly, the mayor of New York wants nothing to do with this (again, surprisingly) and it is the threat of suit that brings Louis Tulley (Moranis) back into the picture as both their accountant, attorney, and future amateur Ghostbuster. Meanwhile, the river of slime is conjuring up something bad as a painting being housed in the museum where Dana works as a restoration artist is possessed by a spirit who in turn possesses her boss, Janosz (pronounced like Ya Nosh), played very hilariously by Peter MacNichol (who suspiciously may have been the inspiration for Chris Katan's character, Mango, on SNL). Oddly, the future of the city rests with the city, who's notorious aggressiveness (at least in generalizations) may only further the evil as the slime is responsive to certain moods and will act accordingly.If you watched the first one because you enjoyed much of Bill Murray's humor, I would definitely recommend catching the sequel. It does tend to repeat much of the story flow, obviously (isn't Dana at all surprised that this is happening to her again?), and during the reformation of the Ghostbusters team, does capitalize and is aware of itself as a sequel (beginning with Janine Melzner's (Annie Potts, my favorite) yes...we're back). The end is fairly corny considering the all for one and one for all morals and the gathering of city pride by bringing to life the statue of liberty. But nonetheless, the Ghostbusters sequel does have a lot to offer by way of humor that fans of the first may continue to enjoy.

The action is great - the special effects still hold up today, mostly. But where the movie really starts to stumble is the comedy. Now, I've mentioned in a previously that, as a kid, I never really envisioned Ghostbusters as strictly a comedy per-say, and it really bugged me watching the original on DVD because they treated it like it was another Caddyshack, you know? Nothing wrong with Caddyshack, but I don't picture Ghostbusters as a Caddyshack-esquire movie. Ghostbusters 2 really forces the comedy in this regard; it feels bland, rushed, and just lame. While as a kid I might've found Bill Murray screaming at a painting amusing, as a man of 22, I can only wince in pain. It's no wonder Murray was the biggest roadblock in getting Ghostbusters 3 off the ground; Ghostbusters 2 must've embarrassed the hell out of him. It embarrasses me just to watch him. And when the movie runs out of ghost-busting action and Luke-warm comedy, it does what every lame sequel does It re-treads content from the first movie with a slight twist. Taking the role of our Hardened Skeptic in the first movie was Walter Peck, who eventually had the Ghostbusters arrested. Ghostbusters 2 replaces him with a new character who is pretty much the exact same person, except now he's the Mayor's Aide, and he has the Ghostbusters acquitted. These scenes play out pretty much exactly as they did in the first Ghostbusters, but with the aforementioned Luke-warm comedy replacing Murray's sharp wit.Although the edge on the knife has become dull, Ghostbusters 2 still did manage to be a pretty okay movie though. There are times when it hits that mixture that made the first movie a success. The movie is very watchable, but get ready for a few painful moments.

GB2 opened on June 16, 1989. When I was 3-years-old, I remember seeing promotional ads for this movie on TV. I wanted to go see this movie with my brother, but my mom thought it would be too scary for me at age 3. I never got to watch this film until it premiered on SHOWTIME in March 1990.The plot begins on the holiday season before the final decade of the 20th century. The Ghostbusters have become bankrupt over a long period of time. Only Ray and Winston are only available to entertain children at birthday parties. They are even being just as under-appreciated by little kids. One of them comes up and says, My dad says you guys are full of crap. They are mostly doing their best work as plain, ordinary scientists. Dana, whom we all remember from GB1 now has a baby son named Oscar, who was pushed down the streets of Manhattan by an unseen force. The four ex-ghostbusters investigate this problem by illegally drilling a hole in the middle of first avenue. They discover that a large river of PINK SLIME is flowing underneath. This slime causes people to act upon evil impulses, making them evil and mean-spirited. As one of the men get lowered up from the hole, he accidentally smashes something that blows out the power in ALL of New York.The four men are now go face-to-face in court. As the argument gets heated, a group of pesky poltergeists break out and cause terror. The four men eventually take care of the problem and later reclaim their fame and fortune.*THE GHOSTBUSTERS ARE BACK!* As if the problems aren't bad enough, the underground slime flow summons the spirit of a 17th Century warlock named Vigo, who is first taken form as a mysterious painting in the NYC museum of art. A local restorer (Peter MacNicol) for the Vigo painting becomes possessed by the evil spirit and tries to kidnap Dana's child Oscar, so he can be the sacrifice child of the spirit of Vigo. Meanwhile the slime begins to continue causing horrific things to happen all over New York City on New Year's Eve, and the Ghostbusters eventually have to challenge Vigo in order to stop all the madness.My favorite scene in the movie is when a mass of the pink slime oozes out of Dana's bathtub and tries to eat Oscar. I also thought it was cool when the ghostbusters made the Statue of Liberty come to life, making walk down the streets of Manhattan in order to restore all the love and freedom it needed.ILM did a great job with visual effects in 1989's GB2. The effects in GB1 from '84 were supervised by Boss Films, which I thought did a pretty lame job with the stop-motion effects and all, but did a really great job on the marshmallow man effects.The plotline for Ghostbusters II is quite a stretch, but by the end of the film, it all adds up. I still give credit for this movie, because I saw this one, before I saw the original Ghostbusters. Although the film seems to be somewhat of a repeat of GB1 and doesn't appear to have any hardcore adult humor, because GB2 needed to appeal to younger audiences, due to the popularity of the Saturday Morning cartoon series, it appears to be a well-made and enjoyable sequel. I really enjoyed the Bobby Brown songs that were included on the soundtrack as well.The Ghostbusters have once again proven that they where indeed one of the BIGGEST and BEST of 80's icons. To this day both movies are close to becoming classics.7/10 stars -- A GOOD MOVIE!

Soon the Ghostbusters are back in business as new ghosts and ghouls are on the loose and threatening the safety of everyone. GHOSTBUSTERS II hit theaters and it certainly made money but I think most people walked out of the place disappointed and while there's no question this is no where near the original I still think it has enough charm to make it worth viewing.

All of the cast members are in fine form as they have no problem getting back into the flow of things but there's no doubt that all of them are trying to swim up river because the screenplay is so mediocre that you really have to wonder what the filmmakers were doing and why they signed off on this story. For starters, the main ghoul this time out spends the majority of the film inside a painter and no matter how much they talk about his evil powers he's simply not a very entertaining character. Even worse is the final showdown because there's simply no energy or laughs to be had. The entire film comes off rather lazy as it's a copy of the first movie with only a few new things added. The familiar stuff includes Murray trying to romance Weaver. The boys get thrown in jail for their acts. Everyone calls them a fraud and they're looked at as fools until the city must come and ask for them to save it. Everything that happens in this movie will be recognizable to those who have seen the original and there's no question that the material here just can't match the first film. With that said, why do I still give the film three stars? I simply think that cast members are so good that you can't help but have a somewhat good time even if you wish what you were watching was delivering more laughs. There are still a few good laughs and the majority of them come from Murray who has no problem playing that laid back, sly character that everyone loves.

When sequels are different from the original, people complain. When they're too close, people say they're just remakes. This is why I think people generally don't enjoy the thought of film sequels.But I'll admit it. I like sequels. When they are deserving or done right, I enjoy them. When I meet likable characters I don't mind seeing them again. Now, sometimes there should never be sequels to movies with likable characters. Sometimes there can't be (what would The Usual Suspects II be about?). But sometimes, like with Ghostbusters, sequels can be a good thing.Sometimes they're done very well (The Godfather Part II, Aliens, Terminator 2, Toy Story 2, X-Men 2). Sometimes...not (Braveheart 2 -- oh, wait, never mind, that doesn't exist).To make a successful sequel, you have to be a truly great filmmaker. It takes a genius to be able to continue a story with the same characters without straying too far from the original source material, and without losing sight of the original's purpose. (That's why so many die hard fans of Terminator 3 were upset by the ending -- me included -- but hey, the rest of the film was pretty darn good as far as action sequels go.) Ghostbusters II is, I feel, a very good sequel, because it continues the story of the four Ghostbusters, while still sustaining the sights of the first film, and the humor, too. It got bashed by critics and audiences alike when it first hit theaters five years after the original, but what can I say? I enjoy it. In fact, if memory serves me correctly, I saw the sequel before the original, which may have something to do with my love of the film.The Ghostbusters (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson) have been plagued by numerous lawsuits since the opening of their prosperous business, and a court has ordered them to close down their business. But when a mysterious slime haunts Dana (Sigourney Weaver), they come back out of retirement to investigate. Unfortunately, they are arrest, right after discovering that New York City is about to be taken over by an ectoplasmic purple goo flowing beneath the city's highways. And Dana's newborn baby is becoming possessed by an evil spirit -- could the two incidents be related? Surely not.As the end of Ghostbusters had a giant Stay Puff'd man, Ghostbusters II has the Statue of Liberty. Yes, that's right, the good IL' boys enter the Statue of Liberty and walk around New York City extended high above the ground.This sounds corny, yes? Well, it is, but so was the first film. It's meant to be. Corniness is all part of the fun, after all, isn't it? Bill Murray is just as funny as he was in the first film, while Aykroyd and Ramis continue their great co-star roles. People who thought that there wasn't enough black in the original Ghostbusters will be happy to know that Ernie Hudson is in this one from the beginning.I enjoyed this film. I liked the purple goo lurking beneath New York City -- it adds the distinct silliness to the film that the first had. People can complain about Ghostbusters II all they want, but I -- for one -- think it's a great sequel to a great comedy.

Bill Murray looks bored and asleep throughout the whole movie. The romantic scenes are obnoxious as well as Bill Murrays scenes with the baby. The effects are at least better in the original al though that sucks too.A sequel clearly made only for the money.And now Hollywood dishes out a remake. With an all female cast. This has worst idea ever written all over it. I would ask why but the answer is obviously that they have run out of ideas and think they can make money of the original.

HE-MAN  and Bill Murray`s character now has his own chat show for oddballs , and talking of Bill Murray he plays the dead pan humour for all it`s worth . Very good he is too , but then we see spanners in the works , nearly all of them to do with the script . Remember in the first movie NYC was over run with spooks ? Well this seems to have been forgotten as the boys are in court facing charges of false pretence ( Ghosts don`t exist so you don`t need ghostbusters ? ) , and it`s difficult to explain the plot because the script feels more like a series of sketches rather than a cohesive story . I know the first movie wasn`t all that tightly plotted either but at least it felt original and entertaining where as here it just feels like a belated movie made to cash in on the success of the first one . It should also pointed out that since it was made in the 1980s we`re treated to pop songs over the action for no real reason except to get the audience to buy the official soundtrack album. This was a very common technique in cinema from 15 to 20 years ago but now comes across as cynical and datedSo if you saw GHOSTBUSTERS in 1989 you might have enjoyed it more than I did in 2004 .

My mom wondered why i left in such a rush. When a sequel is inevitable it usually works when its part of an ongoing story. Like star wars ,lord of the rings or harry potter. Ghostbusters was a one shot in my opinion, original and funny and you cant top it .this sequel proves that , the jokes arent funny and there are no surprises since you already know the plot going in. Bill Murray is always funny but he should have passed on doing this lame sequel. Grease 2 is another example of why you shouldnt do a sequel when the original was a one shot and cant be topped.Stick with the original. "},{"Title":"BETTER then the original!

Egon, ray and Winston are all back as the ghost busting team and are all so likable and you just want to be there busting with them. they are definitely a great team and have great chemistry as one. this time they go up against viggo the Carpathian. or perhaps HE IS Viggo!. he is the scariest villain the GB's go up against in the 2 films. nothing really scared me in the first film, except maybe slimer charging peter but even that was pretty tame. viggo is a truly scary villain, and that painting......wow. its the stuff nightmares are made of. i know that as a kid i had horrible ones of this guy. like they say, a movie is only as good as its villain, well that is true here, viggo is terrifying. and the slime also creep ed me out. the yanoosh (sp?) character is hysterical and is played brilliantly. Egon is funnier this time around, and the slime is as much a villain as viggo the Carpathian. everybody came back for the sequel, even Louis Tully, Jeanine and Dana Barrett. the special effects are better this time around and the GB's got cool new tools like the slime blower. the movie is more family friendly which i LOVE because you can watch it with kids and it will scare them but also make them laugh a lot. the first movie had some scenes that i think are inappropriate for kids (ie. female ghost scene with ray) so this film was an improvement. proves you don't have to have bad language/sexual references in a film to be funny and entertaining! it was also scarier too, the subway scene comes to mind the most. scared me so much as a kid and still does if watched at night. viggo was a much cooler villain then gozer the gozarian or those terror dogs from the first one. both films are good but GB 2 was more my cup of tea. the one liners by Murray and co. are too much LOL. and ya gotta love Egon's tech-no-talk. i find myself chuckling when i think of the word psychomagnatheric. most comedies (or in this case, action comedy) don't have message of any kind, they are just pointless. but i noticed in GB 2 that the film seemed to have a message about negativity and what it does. the slime grew powerful because of all the hate and ugliness of the city (new york, what a town) and it enabled viggo to gain power. the mayor saying it was every new yorkers right to be miserable is just the attitude that was empowering the evil slime/ghosts. but in the end the city, with the help of the ghost busters, realized that hate and anger was actually helping the evil viggo to rule the world and started to sing and be happy and start giving off lots of positive good natured energy which actually helped the ghost busters a lot in defeating the evil viggo. i thought this was such a good message for both kids and adults alike. because there is so much hate and anger in the world, and this showed what positive goodness can do to stop evil and wickedness.great sequel and i can actually say, better then the original despite what the creators/GB 1 fan boys think.

One day our fellow heroes are arrested for violating their restraining order as they prove themselves in court that they aren't frauds, however two evil spirits show up to terrorize the courthouse as they convince the judge that their restraining order is to be off and be back in business.

I think it is funnier, scarier (Viggo scares the bejeezus out of me), and much more clever. Also, I think in general if sequels are well done then it is possible to beat the first film as, in this case, you already know and love the characters so watching the sequel is like revisiting old friends. It also allows you to get straight into the plot of the movie without having to go through the getting-to-know each character parts, as we already know them from the first film. Venkman is hilarious in this film, although it is hard to beat his Yes it's true, this man has no dick line from the first film. The villain is actually slightly scary while in the first film the dog/marshmallow man are just humorous. Great plot, fantastic cast who deliver a stellar performance. Not the best film ever made, but certainly one worth watching more than once. Highly recommended.

Strangely it didn't exactly set the world alight when it was released in 1989. Why? I don't know, it certainly isn't because its a bad film because it's great. All of the top names from the original came back for this one even Sigourney Weaver. It's very nearly every bit as good as the first and much, much better than most sequels can claim to be. Bill Murray is again hilarious in this one and you might have to watch the film more than once to catch all his funny lines. Dan Ackroyd is great as is Harold Ramis who spends more time behind the camera these days. Also Ernie Hudson returns so why isn't he on the cover of the DVD with the rest of the guys? Shame on you Columbia Pictures. Rick Moranis is very funny in this, but to be honest the only time I've liked him in any films it has been in the two Ghostbusters films in anything else I've found him unfunny and annoying. The film has quite a good message too about the need for more love and friendship between people and less hatred, no really it does! I would loved to have seen a Ghostbusters III but I think that would have happened by now, I can't see there being another in 2004 with the original gang, and if it wasn't with Murray, Ackroyd, Ramis, Hudson etc I wouldn't want to see it. To make another with a younger team would be lame and I hope they don't do it. I give Ghostbusters II a 7/10.

This time around, he shares the directorial duties with sitcom writer Ivan Reitman. The story, which si apparently the answer to the title's question, is 'Ghostbusters II ????'.Despite the presence of Reitman, this one is typical Bill Murray stuff - each with a moral at the end. There is also an awesome CGI-enhanced scene that helps to close the movie with a bang. I mention 'awesome' in relation to low-budget standards, not Hollywood-type wizardry, of course.The film deals with three swindlers who start a four-digit (4D) telephone gambling scam and charge the winners 20 per cent of their takings. Things get out of hand when they encounter competition and a vengeful wandering spirit.It's about two army reservists (Ernie Hudson and Wang Lei) who take an illegal short-cut during jungle training - and end up in a nightmarish setting.The film is set during the lunar seventh month when hungry ghosts are supposed to roam the world of the living. Three siblings (played by 'usual suspects' Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Henry Ramis) find themselves being 'visited' by their late mother's spirit and start blaming her for their financial woes. However, they learn the true meaning of ancestral blessing when they embark on a road trip and...Don't expect to be scared by these ghost stories. They are meant to be funny rather than scary. The first two segments appear like comedy sketches, especially where screenwriter Ramis resorts to infantile gags and toilet jokes to keep the comedy going.Aykroyd and Murray stand out in these segments, giving their roles a tongue-in-cheek treatment that helps to set the jovial mood for the show.Of the three, the best is House Got Ghost, which is performed by Murray's regulars, Sigourney Weaver and Richard Moranis, in roles they are so familiar with. In fact the episode looks like an extension of last year's Garfield A Tail of Two Kitties in which veteran actress Jennifer Love Hewitt also played the mother. It is fitting that Murray and Harold end the movie with this one as the moral lesson will linger with the viewers as they leave the cinema. It is not one of Murray's best but still watchable.

Basically it has been five years since the events of the previous film, and the Ghostbusters, the once-lucrative paranormal removal business has become bankrupt, plagued by court orders and lawsuits, they are almost a laughing stock. Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) hosts a little-watched psychic TV show, Dr. Raymond 'Ray' Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) owns a bookstore, Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) is conducting laboratory experiments on human emotions, and along with Ray, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) is an unpopular kids' entertainer. Soon enough though divorced Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) has something strange happening in her New York apartment, and it seems that she may have a ghost trying to do something with her eight-month year old baby Oscar (twins William T. Deutschendorf and Henry J. Deutschendorf II). While Peter, Ray and Egon investigate the strange goings on in Dana's apartment, involving a high amount of ecoplasmic slime, there's something weird going on at the Manhattan Museum of Art where the painting of Vigo the Carpathian (Wilhelm Von Homburg, voiced by Max Von Sydow) has possessed gallery boss Dr. Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol). The Ghostbusters eventually get the chance to prove themselves before the freaked out court Judge Stephen 'The Hammer' Wexler (Harris Yulin), and they are back in business ready to help hundreds of people. The slime, which reacts to negative vibes from people, e.g. shouting, has spread all over the city, but Egon has invented a way to use the slime with positive vibes. In the end, after bringing the Statue of Liberty to life and crashing into the museum, the Ghostbusters, with a little help from Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) the evil spirits are defeated, baby Oscar is saved, and the whole city is safe. Also starring Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz, Ace Ventura; Pet Detective's David Margulies as Mayor Lenny, Scary Movie's Kurt Fuller as Jack Hardemeyer, Bobby Brown as Mayor's Doorman, Cheech Marin as Dock Supervisor, Ben Stein as Public Works Official, Philip Baker Hall as Police Commissioner, Kevin Dunn as Milton Angland and Twins' Chloe Webb as Elaine. The cast still do pretty well in their roles, there are some reasonable jokes in amongst the lame story and not as interesting special effects, it might not be as good as the predecessor, but not a bad supernatural comedy. Okay! "}]
