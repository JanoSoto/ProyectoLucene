Everyone is perfectly cast in this - particularly Kate Beckinsale as Flora, Joanna Lumley as Mrs. Smiling, Eileen Atkins as Judith and Ian McKellen as Amos.  Rufus Sewell makes for great eye-candy as Seth, and the virtually unknown Maria Miles is adorable as Elfine.  Aunt Ada Doom, played by Sheila Burrell, constantly reminds us that There have always been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm, and although it's probably best to keep it that way, she's in for a few surprises.  Flora's dealings with Mr. Mybug, hysterically portrayed by Stephen Fry, are alone worth the price of renting this movie. Flora's decision to go to Cold Comfort Farm after her parents die sets the tone for the rest of the movie; it sounds Interesting and appalling...the others just sound appalling!

Why? Simple it is hilarious, has a star-studded and perfect ensemble cast, and is a beautiful adaptation of an equally, if not more hilarious, book. When one thinks about this movie, one always returns to the cast and how well-suited they were for their roles. Kate Beckinsale fits perfectly in the role of London d√©butante Flora Poste who, like Jane Austen, could not endure a mess. Ian McKellen plays his role to fire and brimstone perfection. Rufus Sewell is remarkably well suited as the smoldering Seth with his brooding eyes and husky, outdoors-y sentiments. Eileen Atkins plays the extremely depressed, reverse-Oedipal mother of Seth in all her exceptional oddness. This is but naming a few of the fabulous cast members that fills this film. The film itself is beautifully filmed and beautifully acted. I would highly recommend it to anyone who 1)enjoys subtle British humor and 2)just enjoys an all-around excellent film.

It is not a Jane Austen story, but it is a sort of genial romance/comedy of manners (set in the early 1930's?) with a plucky, bright, but penniless heroine. The book it was based on was actually a parody of Gothic romance fiction. Even though this movie is played for laughs (and has many), it still manages to make you care for the characters. Everything works here and (editing, cinematography, performances) and you really appreciate what the director, John Schlesinger, managed to do on a probably skimpy budget.This movie was the first I ever saw of Kate Beckinsale and I thought she was fantastic in it. I remained a fan for a long while, even though her subsequent movie performances (and choices) have been awful. She finally lost me with her recent laughable turn in Van Helsing. Nevertheless, she WAS good in Cold Comfort Farm, so if you're no fan of Beckinsale don't let that dissuade you from seeing this movie.Other standouts in the cast are Eileen Atkins, Rufus Sewell, and Ian McKellen who is screamingly funny as a fire and brimstone preacher.This film is definitely worth having on video or DVD in that it bears up very well to repeated viewings. I've seen it at least 5 times since its release, and my estimation of it rises with each viewing.

In fact it's an amusing romp, largely because all the actors are letter perfect -- not easy with a broadly satiric story like this one. Flora Poste's romantic notions actually produce positive results with the loutish Starkadders, such as matching the etiolated Elfine with her true love and sending the smoldering Seth off to become an American film star, while Flora herself ends the movie linked to her own very suitable suitor. Dialogue and motion picture scenery cannot reproduce the exquisitely sly writing of Stella Gibbons, however, so if you liked this movie, by all means read the 1932 book.

Often these movies rely on a central character who is magical, or has great charm and a love for life, but Flora achieves her ends through pure English practicality, and it is very amusing to see someone approaching misery as a mess to be cleaned up. Flora, excellently portrayed by Beckinsdale, is pretentious and rather smug but also well-meaning and likable. In a way she seems to be the personification of British imperialism, although that's probably a bit of a stretch.Much of the fun of the movie is the ridiculous level of misery and squalor represented by Cold Comfort Farm, which is a parody of the sort of grim worlds one can find from writers like Dickens. Eileen Atkins does a great job, but then they all do. The only real weak point in the movie is Mybug, who seems completely unnecessary. Perhaps he was a significant character who served some purpose in the novel, but here he is just this annoying peripheral character, and had he been cut entirely out of the movie it would have been all the better for it (although I generally like Stephen Fry). In spite of that, an excellent film.

If you come to this doomed 'ouse, what is there to save you?- Judith Starkadder in COLD COMFORT FARM.The child in question is the lone offspring of one Robert Poste (deceased) and, as we are soon to discover, Poste's progeny, Flora, is hardly one in need of saving. Orphaned in her budding womanhood, nettled by the golden orb of an unrealized literary career, Flora strikes out from the discerning (or snobbish) urban sophistication of London ( leaving behind her good friend Mary and Mary's invaluable manservant, Sneller) and heads for the bucolic splendor of the Sussex countryside to lodge with her relatives, the Starkadders, and find herself.She finds instead a muck-begrimed tumbledown estate wherein resides a ready-for- Hollywood womanizer (Cousin Seth), an estate-coveting farmer (Cousin Reuben), a daffy romantic (Cousin Elfine), a too-loving mother (Cousin Judith), a 'vengeful god', proselytizing father (Cousin Amos), and an iron-willed matriarch (Greataunt Ada Doom). There's also a smattering of Lambsbreath (Adam) and a smidgen of Hawk-Monitor (Dick).Inside the Starkadder fold Flora encounters a resistance to dish washing modernity (the twig versus the hand mop); the rumor of an unmentionable misdeed once perpetrated against her father; the oft-cited permanence of the Starkadders on their environs; and the matriarch's frequently mentioned trauma after having witnessed a particularly odious occurrence inside the outdoor log pile storage facility (...something nasty in the woodshed). Undaunted, Flora presents a cool brow and an almost impervious demeanor plus an extremely persuasive power to influence. Within COLD COMFORT FARM, where high fashion and applied scientific reasoning smash headlong into arrested sociological development and stunted personal/ familial growth, tear-inducing laughter is the order of the day.As mentioned in the comments of others, Ms. Beckinsale, clad in her natty period togs and radiating a winsome, unflappable aura (while also projecting a strangely prepubescent vibe), hasn't had as good a role since Flora. Meanwhile, those master thespians, Freddie Jones, Ian McKellan, and the inimitable Eileen Atkins nearly go mad with delight as they burrow gleefully into their characters. Rufus Sewell's Seth smolders hilariously while Stephen Fry's Mybug, soaked in nature's fecund blessing, blusters uproariously. This sort of comedy of manners and cultural collision required an intelligent, perceptive and witty director. John Schlesinger (DARLING, 1965) fit the bill gloriously.

This is an excellent and very earthy adaptation of Stella Gibbon's 1932 satirical novel (which itself is an odd marriage of Hardy and Wodehouse). Where the village pub is named The Condemned Man and the cows are named Aimless, Feckless, Graceless, and Pointless. Both the novel and its adaptation are joyfully depressing and packed with literary eccentricity and subtle humor. If you like Faulty Towers then you can expect to get off on the humor. But if you prefer Hot Shots! Part Deux, you should probably pass on Cold Comfort Farm. There are three possible viewer reactions It's not funny. I didn't figure out it was a comedy until halfway through but then I found it hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. Kate Beckinsale plays Flora Poste (always referred to by her relatives as Robert Poste's daughter), a recently orphaned 19 year old who chooses to live with relatives (the Starkadders) she has never met, at gloomy Cold Comfort Farm in Sussex. Beckinsale, even more radiant than usual, pulls off a nice characterization of the resourceful yet snobbish heroine. Like Pollyanna, she is a catalyst for positive change, but they are calculated changes. Her instinctive snobbishness (Beckinsale has a real talent for this) is played for laughs since everyone would feel a bit superior and distanced from this eccentric collection of misfits.The adaptation nicely incorporates Gibbons's subtle parody of Jane Austen romantic clich√©s, from the controlling madwoman in the attic to wood nymph poetess, to the quivering parishioners. Even the production design is a funny send-up of the standard BBC mini-series look. This is really a terrific production, doubly so for Beckinsale fans.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

The Starkadders mooch about muttering threateningly until Flora eventually sets them all on the right path to recovering prosperity. Flora is the kind of upbeat heroine who would take a hot cup of cocoa to Dracula because he is probably cold after all  that time in the tomb.

Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm.I have only been able to get my hands on one of the two sequel novels that Stella Gibbons wrote about these same characters, Conference at Cold Comfort Farm and it is not quite as good.

Great Aunt Ada Doom is at the core of their lives even when not present.Kate Beckinsale's Flora Poste is possibly too wordly wise and unflappable, which tends to blunt the sharpness of the impact of the story, causing many subtleties of the original to be lost. Too much has been done to make it into Sunday teatime TV viewing.  It might be useful to compare it with earlier versions if they can be found.

An example of this was Flora's marvellous conversation with Mr Mybug (Myerburg) in the coffee shop (especially regarding D.H. Lawrence and Branwell Bronte). While many films spoil a book, I believe this film makes the book even more enjoyable to read as Kate Beckinsale's depiction of Flora (as well as the performances of the remainder of the flawless cast) add texture to the already colourful characters.

It can get rather dry, so dry that it's simply not funny(like the novel LUCKY JIM), but when it works, it's great to watch, and it works here.  A friend of mine said while the book may have been a parody of Dickens, this film can be seen as a parody of Merchant/Ivory, and I think he's right.  A couple of people who have commented have compared Flora Poste to Emma, and I'll have to admit that never occurred to me, but it seems apt.I see I'm getting literary here.  Well, yes, this movie is literary(after all, Flora aspires to be a writer), but never in a condescending or precious way.  Instead, it's funny and witty(which went out in American humor a long time ago), full of great characters and flawless performances.  Huge kudos, of course, go out to Kate Beckinsale, who had little to do as Hero in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, but shows herself to be quite a comedienne here.  But the supporting cast, including Joanna Lumley as Flora's friend Mary Smiling, Sheila Burrell as Aunt Ada Doom, Ian McKellen as Amos, and Rufus Sewell as Seth(also Stephen Fry and Eileen Atkins) are all perfect as well.

She tells her friend Mrs. Mary Smiling (Joanna Lumley) that she wants to be a writer but only when she's 53 after some living.

She is married to Amos (Ian McKellen) and has a womanizing son in Seth (Rufus Sewell). Flora insists on bettering the unhappy farm.This is a comedy but just not really my kind of comedy. It's based on a British comic novel from the '30s. It skewers the romantization of the English country farm life from British literature. It's a dated comedy from another era and it's British.

In Flora Poste, Robert Poste's child, Stella Gibbons created one of the enduring characters in the great canon of English Literature. Part Thoroughly Modern Millie and part Mary Poppins, this unflappable and distinctively British neo-flapper is always totally in control. She can't be bought. She can't be sold. She can't be baited (although she can be dated--but only on her own terms). And she always knows which end is up, and exactly what's what. She's urbane and hip, but she likes to preserve neatness and cherishes a sense of order Nature's all very well in her place, but she mustn't be allowed to make things untidy . . .  Sounds like Mary Poppins! And like Mary, Flora is going to enter a dysfunctional household and set things right. (And like Mary, after mission accomplished, she will fly off into the sky at the end.)It is most diverting to watch Flora repeatedly go nose to nose with the dirty, loutish and intimidating Starkadders without blinking or losing one bit of her composure and equanimity. As for Kate Beckinsale's performance as Flora, It's hard to imagine that this demure and perfectly controlled actress is the same person who will later play the sexy vampire warrior Selene who specializes in killing werewolves in the horror-action series Underworld. But perhaps the werewolves of Underworld are not so different from the Starkadders of Cold Comfort, whom she also subdues, but in a more genteel fashion, and without any blood and gore. In both cases, Kate is triumphant (and does Kate Beckinsale remind anybody else of Kate Middleton? Watch Serendipity.)Other delights of Cold Comfort Joanna Lumley as Mrs. Mary Smiling watch this familiar vivacious actress command a scene and hold a conversation with her eyes. Oh, and Joanna still has lots of it; that's her as Aunt Emma in The Wolf of Wall Street.Stephen Fry as Mr. Mybug. Pseudo-intellectual pomposity played to perfection. My favorite line let me warn you. I'm a queer, moody brute, but there's rich soil in here if you care to dig for it. His plan to write a treatise proving that Branwell Bronte was actually the author of the classics written by his sisters is hilarious.But my favorite scene in the entire movie is when Amos Starkadder (played by Ian McKellen) in his role as hellfire and brimstone amateur evangelist preacher, delivers his fiery sermon to the Church of the Quiverin' Brethren. Yes, the congregation actually quivers and shakes as Amos taunts them with the tortures that await them all You know what it's like when you burn your hand takin' a cake out of the oven or lighting one of them Godless cigarettes? And it stings with a fearful pain. Aye? And you run to clap a bit of butter on it to take the pain away, aye? Aye. Well, I'll tell ye. THERE'LL BE NO BUTTER IN HELL!And of course I must mention horrible old Aunt Ida Doom, whose refrains I saw something nasty in the woodshed and There's always been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm are the mantras that maintain her tyrannical control over the homestead--the demonic spells with which Flora must contend.

Our heroine (played by the ever fresh Kate Beckinsale) ends up changing everyone's life for the better and in the end, her own as well. But this is NOT heavy drama. This story is for pure fun and those wanting a good time, the line starts here. And let me prepare you, there are so many great phrases that are entrenched in the true to life events that you will definitely want to view this movie with several friends. The phrases will remain in jokes and be quoted by all in attendance for ... ever (as it was in the case of my family).

Mis Poste is an orphan trying to exist on ¬£100 a year allowance whilst awaiting literary inspiration. She goes to live with relatives in rural Sussex,the Starkadders,who run the eponymous Cold Comfort Farm. There is a Chaucerian vulgarity to their personal habits and jovial disregard of middle class morals which discomfits Miss Poste and she decides to lift them up a peg or two,to help them whether or not they want it - a bit like Amelie,in fact.

Miss K.Beckinsale is perfect as Miss Poste a character never actually meant to be believable,merely lovable.Like a sophisticated Fairy Godmother. Mr Freddie Jones and Miss Eileen Atkins avoid Grand Guignol by a thoroughly enjoyable hairsbreadth.

Upon arrival, she finds the family manse lives up to its name as everyone she meets seem enveloped in a shroud of doom and/or filth.

It seems there is a reclusive dowager in an upstairs room who somehow holds and iron grip on the rest of the family due to something mysterious that happened many years ago. All she will eventually say about it is I saw something nasty in the woodshed! This doesn't deter Beckinsale's character as she weaves an air of trust and optimism among the family members who begin to look to her for answers to their dilemmas. Does she get to the crone who saw something nasty in the woodshed? I'll never tell. But let me add this - this movie ain't no Pollyanna.

It's a rollicking good comedy with a laugh-out-loud collection of Dickensian characters (the doom-stricken Starkadders, the rustic Adam Lambsbreath, and the upper crust Hawk-Monitors).  Certainly the film is very over-the-top and silly, but it's light-hearted fun - a welcome alternative to the glut of psychological, heart-wrenching, blood-and-guts fare on the market.      The Starkadders live on the bleak acres of Cold Comfort Farm, where the cows are barren and the sows are farren.  Into this gloomy and eccentric setting comes young, 1930s-modern Flora Poste, who sets to winning the hearts and minds of Cold Comfort's inhabitants, and dragging the Starkadders into the twentieth century.  Along the way she manages to rearrange and enliven her own life too.      Kate Beckinsale (prior to her arrival on the scene of big-budget American flicks) is a likeable and chirpy young lady with a talent for organisation.  In the supporting roles, Joanna Lumley is delightfully sarcastic as Flora's incongruously named aunt, Mary Smiling, who has a rather unusual hobby.  And Ian McKellen is a real scene-stealer as the fire-and-brimstone preacher of the Church of the Quivering Brethren.      The plot revolves around Great Aunt Ada Doom and the 'narsty' thing she saw in the woodshed nigh on 70 years ago.  There is also the mysterious wrong perpetrated on Flora's father by the Starkadders sometime in the dim and misty past.  So it is a tad frustrating that the audience is never let in on either of these secrets!  But these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise an excellent comedic romp, with some interesting and atmospheric cinematography.  A very good (and very British) laugh.

Flora Poste is the city heroine of her own Jane Austin plot in this movie. After being orphaned, she decides it's her calling to happy up or marry off (well off) all of her relatives, when she goes to live with them on their once-was-gentry but now dilapidated county farm.

Given this material; the propensity of the English to believe it's their job to tidy up rooms, regions and nations, matched by the arrogance to subjugate and condescend to anyone they deem untidy over the centuries; it seems like the movie could be a drag. As a story it's been told one too many times... but a light touch and a off-kilter tone make it an enjoyable fable. It's a fond allegory of empire.Robert Post's child w/o hope of fortune but with great confidence in her world-view, takes on a rural situation out of boredom, works absurdly positive miracles, and sets things right, handily rescuing everyone from their self-constructed cages; all while reckoning with the gravitas of an unseen Miss Havisham in the room off the landing While Flora has no humility of her own, she does have manners; and with those, she pushes a bunch of maladaptive family members to a place they can unload their baggage by rediscovering humility.Making it all more bearable, the urbanites (played by Lumley and Beckinsale), typically snide and unlikeable, instead are awfully pleasant when they condescend. A few lines still make me smirk. It's not good to be dewy-eyed around smart people, but you can always secretly despise them is given a bright, cheerful delivery by Lumley. While perfectly serviceable as an unspoken rule of etiquette, it sounds quite absurd when uttered. A house-man who develops a admiration for his dish-scrubber, ...me and my little mop always makes me laugh.Manners come into play everywhere. Ruben's change from a gruff beast to a sweet fella is nicely done. A late scene in which Miss Post must gently rebuff his proposal has a sublime, light touch. Strangely, after countless viewings where I simply admired the writing, it made me tear up for the first time today. The cast all does expert work, making most of the movie look effortless. Lumley's bespoke Miss Smiley could make for a good movie on her own.The film was developed for British TV which explains a regrettable gag here and there, and some resolutions that are just too pat. Schlesinger replaced somebody else as director at the last minute. As director, it feels like he's confident in the material and just gets out of the way. I think there are just slight problems that prevent it from becoming a classic. Aunt Ada saw something nasty in the woodshed a few too many times. But there is an abundance of pleasures in it. The way manners are voiced... the ramshackle design of the old farmhouse.

She gets more than she bargained for. First of all, the farm is really a farm, with cows, pigs, horses and barns. Second, it's a sprawling, dilapidated affair, which one character refers to as the house of Usher. Third, the place is cluttered and filthy and no one cares. Fourth, the half dozen or so residents are just as filthy as the floor and seem to have been inbred for generations. Finally, they are apparently ruled by an old madwoman who sequesters herself in an upstairs room and mutters about having once seen something nasty in the woodshed.Now, these are all very queer characters and each in his own way is a fit case study of psychopathology. Perhaps the most interesting is the preacher, who carries on in the local church, the walls of which are spritzed with lurid graffiti, about how much hell hurts. Did you ever burn your finger? It hurt, didn't it. And what did you do about the burned finger? You put butter on it. Well, friends, THERE IS NO BUTTER IN HELL. Man, there is material enough for a dozen novels.There is a problem with a movie so filled with nuts though. It reminded me of a movie I'd worked in, Crimes of the Heart, written by Beth Hemsley, about three quirky sisters, any one of whom would have provided a viable narrative. But Crimes of the Heart, like Cold Comfort Farm, really has nowhere to much go.In this movie, Kate Bekinsale -- a fantasy of pale and vulnerable beauty -- straightens everything out. People wind up married to those whom they should marry. A half-hour, off-screen chat brings the old crone to her senses and she takes off for Paris. The farm ends up in the hands of the most capable of its workers. Bekinsale literally sails off with the handsome young aviator.Afterwards I felt as if I'd visited a mother who trotted out a handful of lovely children, had them rattle off an idiosyncratic and brilliant version of the Trout Quintet, and then shuffled them outside to play. Gone in a twinkling.It's interesting without being particularly well constructed. Loved the characters, some of them anyway, and almost fell asleep waiting for the happy ending.

He later renounced that theory and decided that such dreams were manifestations of suppressed desires and emotions. The subject never actually sees what was nasty and the woodshed is not real, either.Modern psychotherapists, for the most part with minimal training, have gone back to Freud's original theory, but the supposedly 'repressed memories invariably are so far-fetched as to violate fundamental laws of physics. Ada Doom's memory, for example, would probably have a woodshed with many rooms, stairs both up and down, windows, etc., all fitting within the small exterior of the building. The something nasty would include people who may well have been dead at the time, or who were far away, or who never existed at all. The ax implies murder and human sacrifice, a manifestation of feelings that she was mistreated by her own parents (or maybe Robert Poste). The dark wood-stains and shadows imply blood. The interior of the woodshed is dark, mysterious and quiet, as of a horror lurking there -- a hidden truth that no one can face.The movie, made during the height of 1990s witch hunt, parodies people who use memories of imaginary (or even real) events to control everybody around them. Interestingly, earlier productions were made during similar cultural periods. The 'something nasty' can represent anything from incest to fear of financial ruin to communism.The nasty memories, probably of fictitious events, manifest themselves in the untidiness of the Starkadders. The farm is practically in ruins, despite the fact the Starkadders are wealthy. Everything is all loose ends, hidden secrets, unfinished business. Flora Poste represents the traditional Freudian therapist, one who sees through all the junk of the mind and starts putting things in order by forcing people to see the truth about themselves and their situation, to stop dwelling on events (which are imaginary anyway) of the past and which have absolutely no bearing on the present. The Starkadders, one by one, have a paradigm shift away from suspicion, secrecy, and guilt to productivity, optimism, and adventurousness. They no longer live in fear.The movie ridicules fear and guilt. They are not just 'untidy,' they enslave us, tie us down, and keep us from reaching our full potential. Flora Poste represents the whole woman, idealized. She fears nothing for herself, despite the fact that she is the one character that actually has serious problems to deal with. Orphaned, virtually penniless, with an uncertain future, yet she could not care less. Unlike the miserable Starkadders who are helpless despite wealth, position and power, Flora Poste is the master of her own fate despite her lack of all the advantages the the Starkadders have.The movie allows us to laugh at our fears and shortcomings, and encourages us to take control of our own destinies. What is not to like about it?

The viewer is asked to believe that a well brought up but penniless orphan (Kate Beckinsale) comes to live with relatives who mostly despise her and hate one another and who want desperately to leave this wretched, filthy, gloomy farm but cannot do so because of a tyrannical recluse of a family matriarch who is holed up in her room, consuming enormous quantities of food -- and in the course of an hour and a half, the plucky young orphan has transformed the lives of everyone on the farm, including the matriarch and the gloomy, mad cousin who invited her to come live with them because of a unexplained but terrible wrong done to the young woman's father by this family. Kate Beckinsale is outstanding in the role of the orphaned young woman and Ian McKellen effortlessly steals the picture from everyone but Beckinsale in his role as a fire-and-brimstone preacher whom Kate's character persuades to leave the farm to his eldest son and pursue his mission of preaching his terrifying gospel to the world. The picture has its moments, mostly because of Beckinsale and McKellen, though there is also a wonderful bit involving a Hollywood producer friend of the young orphan's who is persuaded to visit the farm and make a movie star of the lecherous younger brother. Mostly, however,Cold Comfort Farm is thin gruel and not nearly as amusing as the people who made it seem to think it is.

I honestly don't think that this movie captured the fun of the book in the way that the earlier BBC version did.I actually found it a bit tedious, rather than fun, and they left out some of the best lines, really, for no good reason. I found that it got rather boring toward the end, and didn't really manage to give a sense of Flora Poste's STRUGGLE to change Cold Comfort Farm--it all changed too easily, and so one didn't really have the nice tension will she succeed?--she wins over everybody far too easily, and I think a good deal of the story is probably incomprehensible without knowing the book first.So--my verdict is find that wonderful old BBC version with Alistair Sim and Rosalie Crutchley and Faye Compton--and treat yourself to the book, which is the sort you pull out again to enjoy afresh, years later, and catch this one if it comes on TV, but don't go out of your way for it.

This is meant to be a spoof of the novels of such writers as Dickens and Austen. It is described as a comedy, and the way the actors deliver their lines certainly suggests that the dialog is dripping with wit. The only problem is that there is nary a single chuckle to be had from the humorless script. With hardly a plot to hold one's interest, it soon turns into a dreary bore. It is based on a popular comic novel from the 1930s; hence the humor is either dated or the screenplay does not do justice to the novel. It's a shame because it has a good cast that seems to be really trying.

Perhaps this particular effort was lacking in some cohesion that might have held my attention. Although the characters were certainly characters and the incongruities certainly incongruous, nothing about this movie satisfied my curiosity. The cast was terrific and their acting was quite good but the storyline seemed unhinged. If a lot of the book was omitted the movie didn't prompt me to even consider reading it. I was left with the uncomfortable feeling of having watched a bunch of oddities that somehow were never properly connected. And the denouement (a final part of a story or drama in which everything is made clear and no questions or surprises remain) was completely useless in that regard since it left me with more questions than I had before.

The acting was dismal, the story line unengaging, the direction indifferent, and the all-too-frequent attempts at humor pathetically lacking in comedic chops. This so-called star, Kate Beckinsale, could not act her way out of an amateur troupe, at least to judge from the shallow characterization here. Stephen Fry was bad, bad, bad, as was Joanna Lumley. Only Ivan Kaye as Reuben Starkadder deserves any kind of accolades. He was the solitary believable member of the wasted cast. I kept waiting for Cold Comfort Farm to get off the ground, but it just wallowed in its own mediocrity. Even the music was ill-conceived. At one point, a lengthy excerpt from Max Steiner's Gone With the Wind soundtrack came out of nowhere, an embarrassing anachronism worthy of another clunker from the past, Baz Luhrmann's horrid Moulin Rouge! Please don't invest your hard-earned money in this misguided project. You will regret it.

With no options or ambition (except to experience life and become a writer), she goes to live in the country with distant relatives. Upon arriving at the dilapidated farm, she finds its inhabitants are all gloomy, filthy, wretched oafs, so naturally she sets about improving their lives.This basic plot has been done before, most notably in Amelie, but this BBC movie is terrible. There's no humor, the characters are all off-putting, and the changes Flora brings about - including turning a spaced-out na√Øf into a debutante, a deranged hermit into a fine lady, and a bumbling farm hand into a Hollywood star - are completely unbelievable. As Flora, Beckinsale is flat and tiresome and the relatives are reduced to English hillbillies. This is a tedious and unappealing movie.

I don't think it has ever had much of publicity, which would explain why it is so unknown to the public. But of course you can find it on this website and all I read about it is that it is perfect, an absolute gem, the best comedy ever... Well, I'm afraid I can't completely agree with that. Yes it is good, but it wasn't brilliant and somehow it was never able to really keep my full attention.Even though the movie has been made in 1995, so only 10 years ago, it feels a lot older. That's not only because of the subject (the story is set in the 1930's), but also because of the humor and the way everything is told. It seemed to me like if this movie was made in the 1950's nice to watch, but a bit too honest. The humor can be quite dark from time to time (which I really like), but somehow the entire movie isn't as sharp as I hoped it would be.The movie tells the story of the 20 year old Flora Poste, recently orphaned and left with only 100 pounds a year, who wants to become a writer and who is in desperate need of money and inspiration. She sends letters to many relatives and ultimately decides to go and live with the Starkadder, some distant relatives who live on Cold Comfort Farm. It is said that the farm and everybody living there is doomed, in reality it is the old grandmother who doesn't allow her family to do what they like to. As a real matriarch, she decides what the members of the family will do, but gradually Flora takes over power and makes her relatives see that there might be a better life...The acting is OK, but the story is a bit too black and white in my opinion. Of course, you could see this as an extra point of comedy, but I think it would have been better if the differences and contrast between the rich people living in the city and the poor people on the countryside were a bit less pronounced. Anyway, that doesn't mean that the movie isn't any good or not watchable. I still give it a 6.5/10.

However, aside from the old matriarch beating everybody with a newspaper, I did not find one funny scene to laugh at.I won't criticize the acting because the performers do a fine job in their acting abilities. But, the story is unbelievable by American contemporary standards. I can't conceive of any American family which would relegate themselves to such constant misery by living on a farm what is falling apart. The characters would have left the farm for the city long ago and Robert Poste's child would have showed up to a half-empty farm. Likewise, the characters are too dirty living. Unwashed faces, dirty clothes never cleaned all make for an interesting scene if it were a war movie with the people in the mud in combat. But, for day to day living it seems that even in the 1920s people cleaned their bodies and clothes.Well, as Flora Poste flies off into the sunset in an open cockpit plane, All's well that ends well.I think this story would turn out better if it were a stage play rather than a movie. It has stage possibilities!

However, a favored friend of mine wuthered on about this, so I decided to watch it.The bottom line, I  probably should have read the Austen first. But I really have no desire to do that still... Then again, my wife, who loved Pride and Prejudice  (firstly on page then secondly on Firth) couldn't quite muster enough interest to stick with this film. A possible litmus test may be how funny you find the family name Starkadder.If your reaction is Oh heavens, what a laugh... or really any thing that starts with Oh heavens... then you are likely going to love this film. I'm not trying to fan this film with such dainty praise...it's meant to be a whimsical film. The characters are realized in a way that's more suited to the stage than to the silver or plasma screen in my opinion. To be fair, it was apparently a made-for-TV movie...in my estimation it might have been a better made-for-radio-play.I suspect this film will grow on me over time, and while I won't bust a gut now on it...when I am ready to titter...I'll reach for this. And I do expect tittering is probably a good 10 to 20 years off... Even at this point, I did enjoy a blubbery, blustery Ian McKellen, and Harry Ditson as the star-maker rain-maker from Hollywood. Others have mentioned those, but above all I could have used more of Trevor Baxter...that's who did it for me, the butler!Of course, in this sort of drama, the butler as part of the underprivileged class is allowed to be smart...even smarter than the upper class women. Meanwhile the men are buffoons or hunks and preferrably both. I would have killed for at least a cad, a rapscallion or a ne'er-do-well!I'm kidding..that honestly is not what prevented me from enjoying this film more. Actually the golden orb mocking of a very fresh-faced Kate Beckinsale was a nice laugh at the expense of her wrought dreams of writing. The film does use that tried and true repetition for comedic effect at times...with awareness to have all of the Starkadders roll deaf eyes when arch-matriarch Ada Doom started on one of her spells... I guess I'm more of a fan of odd juxtapositions for comedy, along with family dysfunction (or other societal expectations) twisted through neurosis and out the other side. This kind of plays upon that, but from another era...and exaggerated out of any sense of proportion.In retrospect, I can envision a pretty funny film, but watching it the first time, I never really fell under its powers. My destiny was the only one Robert Poste's child could not quite chart. Not to say I didn't appreciate the approach (in America I fear we would have cast Goldie Hawn or Fran Dresser in the lead role, sacrificing blithe beneficience for ditzy blundering...)That would have got a negative 3 from me, this I gave a6/10 "},{"Title":"No plot.
