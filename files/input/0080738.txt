Delaney is on his last case tracking down a psychotic serial killer while also dealing with his bed-ridden wife (a warm-hearted Faye Dunaway) that's dying in the hospital from an unclear disease. How these two threads are connected isn't really garnished, other than to give the lead character more emotional weight and progressive depth. Instead it just comes across as depressing and somewhat pointless. It manages to hold you there, but not much really happens in this slow-grinding thriller as Frank Sinatra's wearily brooding performance is determined, but filled with melancholy heartache. Ambitious, but unfulfilled and too long toothed is how you can describe it. The narrative just feels incomplete, like it was aiming for something more profound (like the symbolic use of the cross) and mysterious (the killer's motive) but it came away rather puzzling and affected in its intentions. The grungy New York setting is painted with darkness, dreary atmospherics as there's a killer randomly leaving his victims with a hole in the back of their heads. A lot of the running time (and at times it does drag) has Delaney working the case, starting with very little. Putting in the hours, strenuously gathering info, seeking help outside the police force and thoroughly digging in as his personal life begins to crumble. The focus on his sick wife does very little for the story, but it takes up a fair amount of screen time. When Sinatra isn't mugging the screen, there's some able support in the cast; Martin Gabel, James Whitmore and Joe Spinell added some much needed life. David Dukes makes for an effective loony, but his icy character was just felt too one-note. An interesting, but sleepily underdone dramatic thriller.

If you're thinking that gives the ending away, don't look for an obvious conclusion.To his credit, I guess Frank Sinatra did not want to end his film career with Dirty Dingus Magee. He wanted to end his film with the serious part, unfortunately The First Deadly Sin messes up the telling of a potentially good tale.Frank Sinatra is days away from his retirement as a Detective Sergeant and a strange murder has been assigned to him. A man apparently selected at random is killed with an unidentified weapon that is just driven into the top of his skull. A little good detective work and he finds their just might be a pattern of killings.It's all in identifying the weapon and it's an unusual one at that which I won't reveal. A professor in medieval history played by Martin Gabel helps with the hunt and later on he's joined by the widow of Sinatra's victim, Brenda Vaccaro to help with the hunt.They're helping because Sinatra's new captain is one total jerk played by Anthony Zerbe. Maybe I'm missing something in Zerbe's performance, but I would think that an ambitious guy like Zerbe plays would instead of pooh-poohing Sinatra's ideas would think that this guy if he is on to something with this serial killer business. And if he's right Zerbe will get all kinds of accolades for figuring this out in his precinct and even more if the doer is apprehended. It's an absolutely impossible role and poor Anthony Zerbe can't do much with it.All this while Frank's wife Faye Dunaway falls ill to a misdiagnosed kidney malady. She spends all her time in the hospital and Sinatra visits her at breaks in this case.Frank delivers a very good performance in a role similar to the one he had in The Detective. He's supported by the rest of the cast very well, except with Anthony Zerbe's impossible role. Besides who I've mentioned look for a really nice turn by Joe Spinell as the mendacious doorman where suspect David Dukes lives. His role is similarly undefined, we really never learn why he's doing these crimes.

Delaney - a New York City police detective weeks away from retirement, who gets caught up in a murder investigation that his commanding officer (for reasons I never clearly understood) would prefer him to leave alone. Sinatra's performance, though, was really the only thing that made this movie worth watching. The story of the search for the psychopathic killer wasn't all that interesting, and while the subplot revolving around the illness of Delaney's hospital-bound wife (a rather simple role played by Faye Dunaway) took up a fair amount of screen time, it also added nothing to spark the movie, except perhaps to ground Delaney as a loving husband. Delaney does come across as a sympathetic character for the most part, although he's a cop willing to go to any lengths (legal or otherwise) to get this killer. Aside from that there was one very effective scene in which the curator Langley (Martin Gabel) goes to a hardware store trying to figure out what the murder weapon was which added some welcome comedy relief to this otherwise rather poorly structured and poorly paced movie, which I would frankly have to say was one of the least exciting and least interesting murder mysteries I've ever seen.

It doesn't make a lot of sense, but there's some tension built up in between the general scenery-chewing of Sinatra and others. One wonders exactly what made Sinatra think this was a good idea- he appears pretty bored throughout the film, perhaps shooting for a Philip Marlowe weariness and falling very short. The overall tone of the movie emphasizes the darkness and bleak surroundings of the city, and admittedly the lighting and tone is very dramatic. Sinatra plays a senior police officer in New York who is just about to finish up the job and retire when a strange random murder appeals to him and he becomes the only cop who sees a pattern. His wife, played by Faye Dunaway, is hospitalized throughout the film and Sinatra's character visits her frequently to try and cheer her up as well as criticize the doctors for not doing enough for her.The supporting cast fills in lots of gaps here and makes this fit in, albeit very strangely, with the NYC exploitation style that was current at the time. The great Joe Spinell shows up as a doorman, James Whitmore as the coroner, Brenda Vaccaro, Robert Weil, Eddie Jones, Victor Arnold and even a one-second appearance of Bruce Willis in his first film role. We see the horribly typical subtle racism of Jews and Latinos in New York City being displayed by stereotypes, as well as other policemen shown as haggard and corrupt, merely to contrast with Sinatra's white knight character. Sinatra is shown as the anachronism within the decay of the city- none of the police seem to be able to make any difference, so it takes Sinatra's illegal activities to reduce the story to a simple good vs. evil struggle. Sinatra is so bizarrely set in the story he dresses up like Bogart with a cocked Fedora and even is shown digging up an old Luger to carry in another scene. We never understand why he is so antiquated or what the point is of contrasting him in 1980 Manhattan.Too many misshapen ideas clog this film-- for instance, why exactly is Faye Dunaway in the hospital throughout the film? There is an insistence on a religious overtone throughout the film (besides the title, there are crosses displayed everywhere)that is never explained. Anthony Zerbe phones in a quick appearance as a police captain who tries to reel in Sinatra, who is retiring in mere days from decades on the force. If it weren't bad enough that Zerbe appears needlessly drunk in this scene, his character is supposed to be a no-nonsense captain and when Sinatra asks if he can stay on the case, Zerbe basically says sure, whatever. The two people who break down the murderer's identity are bizarrely the curator of the renowned Arms & Armor wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the wife of the murderer's first victim! Sinatra merely leaves the scene to let them do the work, appropriately showing his seemingly little concern for the plot of this film.The First Deadly Sin is a very confusing film with more loose ends than a thread factory. Sinatra picked a very odd piece of work to make his last starring role and there must be some interesting story behind what happened with this obviously well-budgeted film. Sinatra was never an amazing actor but this is just a mess.

But personally, I thought that the movie was quite riveting almost all of the way through. Sinatra, in a comeback lead performance after a long absence (though it turned out this was his final lead role in a movie), is very good as a close-to-retirement police officer. He plays the role with appropriate weariness that shows his character has seen it all, but at the same time shows another side to his character, one that is dedicated to his job and wants to exit without any loose ends hanging. The heart of the movie - the mystery of a serial killer - is also well done. Now, I will admit that the mystery unfolds at a VERY slow pace, a reason that many people here cite in their disappointment with the movie. But while the investigation unfolded slowly, it felt realistic to me - most investigations by the police in real life unfold at a careful pace. Also, the slower pace made it very easy to understand the unfolding investigation - there are no confusing portions. Well, maybe there is one confusing part. I won't say what happens at the climax, except to say that Sinatra's ultimate action seems a little out of the blue and doesn't seem to fit what we've seen of his character before that moment. Though this surprise does prevent the end of the movie feeling like the endings of other police investigation movies. Give this movie a chance... though maybe wait until you are in a patient mood to fully appreciate it.

Pretty soon it becomes clear that there's a serial killer at work and the detective must try and find out who it is even though he has no one behind him.THE FIRST DEADLY SIN turned out to be Sinatra's final theatrical starring role and it came ten years after his previous turn in DIRTY DINGUS MAGEE. The film was originally released to rather mixed reviews and it ended up not doing too well at the box office and in all reality the thing has pretty much been forgotten in time. It's really too bad the film turned out so mediocre because with a few fine touches it really could have been something special.As it is the film is only worth watching thanks to the excellent performance from Sinatra. The actor had played a detective in some of his late 60's films so it's clear that Sinatra was comfortable playing this type of role. It's also clear that the age of Sinatra here had him showing off a certain calm and patience that we didn't always see to him. You can really see the actor slowly working and carefully planning out the characters moves and I think it really makes for an excellent performance. The actor has such a presence on the screen that it's impossible to take your eyes off of him.The supporting cast includes nice work from James Whitmore, Joe Spinell and Brenda Vaccaro. Faye Dunaway plays the role of the wife and in all honesty she has very little to do outside of acting sick and laying in a bed. This here is the biggest issue with the movie because whenever we flash to her hospital scenes it pretty much kills everything and the film comes to a crashing halt. What's so bad about these scenes is that there's nothing that really happens. Sinatra gives her a flow several times. They talk about the same thing (a house) and there's just nothing here that adds anything to the plot.It also doesn't help that the direction by Brian G Hutton is so deadly dull. There's no visual style going on. There's never any tension. The movie has a very cheap feel as if it belongs on television. What's worse is that it's pretty out-of-date with the times as it seems like it should have been made a decade earlier. They just don't do anything with the material and even the killer is rather boring.THE FIRST DEADLY SIN is worth watching because of the excellent performance by Sinatra but sadly there's not much else here.

A more mild and mellower Frank Sinatra did make the movie interesting then it would have been in playing his age,65, and not trying to be at least 20 years younger in the role he had. As for Faye Dunaway all she did during the entire movie was go in and out of consciousness and try to look pretty, but as white as a sheet, during the entire time she was on camera. As for David Dukes as the zombie like serial killer Daniel Blank his name, Blank, fit the role he had in his zombie like actions through the entire movie. The biggest surprise is in the end when he finally opened his mouth and told the reason for his murderous actions which made as much sense as the cannibalistic and real life serial killer Jeffery Dhamer reasons for murdering his victims did.

Sanders actually gave them sequential titles 'The First Deadly Sin', 'The Second Deadly Sin', 'The Third Deadly Sin'. The series died before Sanders ran out of sins.Frank Sinatra was occasionally an inspired actor, although always an undisciplined one. (He snagged the great lead role of Billy Bigelow in the film version of 'Carousel' -- Sinatra would have been brilliant in this part -- but then dropped it when he learnt that the film was going to be shot in two different screen ratios, and he would have been required to do all his scenes twice.) Sinatra's Academy Award for 'From Here to Eternity' was well-deserved, and in my opinion he should have got an Oscar for 'Von Ryan's Express' too, and possibly for 'Suddenly'. However, Sinatra apparently ran out of energy (and talent) before he made the movie version of 'The First Deadly Sin'. This was Sinatra's last starring performance; apparently he'd planned to develop a franchise series based on Sanders's novels, but this movie was such a clanging flop that no sequels were made. Two later friends of mine had worked (before I knew them) on the crew of this film; they've told me that the production was a nightmare, plagued by wrong-headed decisions.Delaney (Sinatra) is hunting a serial killer while Delaney's wife (Faye Dunaway) struggles with cancer. These two plots never interlink, nor does Sinatra convey any sense of a man torn between two priorities. He just shuttles (in slow motion) between police procedural sequences and hospital sequences.The killer is known to the audience, so it's no spoiler when I tell you that the murderer is Daniel Blank, a wealthy playboy who has no particular motive for killing random Manhattanites he just kills 'em for the hell of it. With an ice axe, no less. The killer is played by David Dukes, who filmed his scenes in Manhattan concurrently while starring on Broadway in 'Bent', in which he played an inmate of a concentration camp. Dukes's head was shaved to a tight crew cut for his stage role, but this coiffure was inappropriate for his film role as a murderous playboy, so Dukes plays his scenes in a hairpiece. Which would have been fine, if the film chose not to call attention to the hairpiece. Instead, we get a stupid sequence in which Dukes's hairpiece flies off while he sinks the axe into a victim's skull. Then we get a bad dialogue scene later, explaining why the playboy has a crew cut and why he wears a wig to cover it. Hell toupee. My friends on the film crew told me that the wig fell off by accident, and then the dialogue was inserted so they wouldn't have to shoot a retake. Frankly, Dukes's performance quite fails to impress me given the handicap of his inappropriate hairstyle, the casting agent should have chosen another actor (with more hair) instead.We get an utterly pointless scene in which Sinatra swots up evidence with two civilian volunteers, of the sort whom real police call 'cop groupies'. One of the volunteers is played by Martin Gabel, an American actor who spoke with a pronounced mid-Atlantic accent. (In real life, Gabel described himself as 'affected'.) Gabel's accent was useful in some other roles, but here it's just distracting.SPOILERS COMING. Sinatra's (very slow) race to find the killer occurs during the week before Christmas, but this has nothing to do with the plot. And the film was shot in late summer, worse luck. (The exterior scenes in this movie show very little snow.) As New Yorkers know, every year during Christmas season -- and *only* during Christmas season -- the Empire State Building's upper floors are lighted green and red. While 'The First Deadly Sin' was shooting principal photography, Sinatra's production company paid some bucks to Helmsley-Spear (the Empire State Building's landlords) to wire up the Christmas lighting a few months ahead of schedule. This *would* have been a very effective device for an exterior shot of Sinatra in midtown Manhattan at night, with the Empire State Building glowing green and red in the background. Instead, after all that trouble, we merely get one quick insert shot of the Empire State Building's upper storeys, lighted in the appropriate colour scheme but with no surroundings -- no context -- at all. This shot occurs immediately before the death scene.Ouch! The death scene. After nabbing the killer, Delaney goes to visit his wife in hospital. This scene is beyond awful. Sinatra reads aloud from an old-time children's book about two little girls named Sunny and Honey. He reads this awful text in a voice so lethargic, he seems to be on meds. Dunaway remains utterly inert through this scene, at the end of which Sinatra realises she's dead. Of boredom, most likely. Fade out.I sat through this rubbish only because I know two people who worked on the tech crew. I'll rate 'The First Deadly Sin' just one point in ten.

Seeking to distract himself from his personal troubles, he becomes deeply involved in trying to solve a series of murders and stop the killer.The story is based on a novel by Lawrence Sanders, who wrote a series of Deadly Sin mysteries. It provided Sinatra with his final starring role in a film, and he plays it well. As the worn-out aging cop, he is effective and moving in several scenes. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't play fair with its audience regarding the killer and it never reaches the tension necessary to be more interesting as a thriller. Thankfully, Sinatra is in nearly every scene and has some nice interactions with supporting players like James Whitmore, Brenda Vaccaro and Martin Gabel.It's David Dukes' killer that we never really get to know. He's alternately bold and weak, and we are never given any insight into why. In a more exciting thriller, we might overlook that flaw, but here it makes the chase a little less interesting. However, as I said, the Sinatra scenes are plenty and they are well-done. For example, there's a nice scene where he buys ten minutes to snoop around an apartment to look for clues. And the scenes with Whitmore's coroner and Gabel's curator are nicely played.Had the makers of the film, which include executive producer Sinatra, been more in-tuned to the serial-killer aspect, they may have balanced out the film a bit more. Also, Faye Dunaway is wasted in her role as the dying wife. She's fine acting her scenes, but has so little to work with that she's almost non-existent. Some complain about the down-beat ending, but I feel that it fits well in the context of the film. As it is, First Deadly Sin represents a solid, yet somber, final star vehicle for Frank Sinatra.

The screenplay artfully removed all the interesting story weaving; the jumping back and forth from killer to cop; the character development and motivation.The movie is so fragmented I doubt anyone who hadn't just read the book will have any idea what is going on.  Especially so with Delaney's helpers and the approach to solving the crime.  This is no doubt one of the reasons current novelists try to keep approval rights when their books are converted to screenplays.The only bright spot, if you catch it, is a young extra named Bruce Willis who walks through one scene.My advice?  Don't bother with this one.  Read the book.

Sinatra's strong presence virtually lifts it out of the ordinary.

To me the novel gives equal time to Delaney and Daniel Blank (hey, what a name for the killer), but this film focuses on Delaney and his problems.I envisioned an actor like Brian Dennehey playing Edward Delaney, a big man with a good heart, very intuitive, and with a big appetite for all kinds of weird sandwiches and always some good beer, not someone like Sinatra, a rather small man.Sanders is a brilliant writer of weird characters, and Daniel Blank was one of his best. Yet the whole film seems to focus on Delaney and the dying wife.I would have much liked to have seen the killer portrayed as he was in the book - a man with a good job, a very strange girlfriend, and brilliant in a horrible type of way.And so slow moving! Lesson learned, never see a movie after you've read the book.

Dunaway is wasted in this particular role as she just lies there. The actors who play the curator and the coroner are great in their supporting roles. Of course, it is Sinatra who carries this film. I probably wouldn't have watched it if he wasn't in it. The pacing is quite slow at the beginning but thankfully picks up about a quarter of the way through. 7/10, though I'll probably never watch this DVD again.

Stick with the novel. This movie is boring and will put you to sleep fast. Seems there's more time spent with Frank talking to his invalid wife in the hospital than him going after this ugly murderer who is the most pathetic screen villain I've ever seen. There's no suspense here, which is key to this genre. It plays like a TV movie all the way through and the only fun happens when Sinatra has a chat with Joe Spinell in a hotel lobby.Score, BOMB "},{"Title":"The First Bruce Willis role","Date":"14 April 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" I was a big mystery fan. Lawrence Sanders was one of the many authors I read, and The First Deadly Sin was a great book. But, like all good books, they usually don't translate well to the screen. This was no exception. The movie just didn't have the punch of the book. Frank Sinatra was getting old (this was his last starring role). Faye Dunaway's performance was so bad that she was nominated for a Razzie(Losing to Brooke Shields for The Blue Lagoon). He didn't have any lines, but this was Bruce Willis' first film.This movie would certainly have turned out differently if the first director had been able to stick around. Roman Polanski had been hired but was dropped when the scandal broke about his statutory rape charges.

Sinatra is definately the highlight and gives a good performance in a role that fits him well.  Faye Dunaway definately needed more screen time but her performance was quite good in the scenes she had.  I am a huge Faye and Frank fan so I may be a little prejudice.  It's pretty good.  I hate to admit though, I have been nervous around hammers ever since! "}{"Title":"Hypocritical vigilante sleaze","Date":"30 December 2008","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Sinatra financed this movie and starred in it, so he is wholly responsible for it, and it shows just what a ghastly gangster-fascist he really was, because --- as no one on this board appears to have even noticed --- it wholly endorses police murder.With the notoriously whitewashed De Menezes and Dziezinski police killings, plus scores of taser deaths, fresh in our minds, we should be calling for this film to be withdrawn from circulation, including from lending libraries. What validity is there in a film that shows its hero taking a death sentence into his own hands, and executing a villain with impunity? Sinatra is supposed to be an Irish detective-sergeant nearing his retirement when serial killings occur. Perhaps the Irish theme explains the prominent Catholic crucifixes on display in various scenes. Or perhaps they are just proto-fascist totems for the vigilante faithful.This film not only endorses repellent values, it is utterly idiotic, with Sinatra conducting a series of interviews to arrive at the screamingly obvious fact that the crimes were committed with an ice-pick. The blindingly blatant ID of the weapon takes him several days, and involves an improbable character undertaking part of the investigation on his behalf. Ridiculous! In an unrelated series of scenes Faye Dunaway, his much-younger wife, is expiring from complications arising from a kidney removal. This gives Frank ample room to display his inability to act, which we have to add to his inability to judge a script or to embrace civilised values.When he summarily executes the killer, this moronic cop (who took a week to identify an ice-pick), transgresses all police regulations, civil and moral law, but all he has to do is turn in his badge and he walks free.An utterly contemptible monument to a disgusting man and the hideously violent and sociopathic circles he moved in. Avoid completely. "},{"Title":"Ill-conceived, but watchable crime story.","Date":"7 January 2003","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Sinatra gave his final dramatic performance in this unusual detective film.  It's unusual because of it's concept which integrates the search for a vicious killer with the agonizing slow death of Sinatra's wife (Dunaway.)  The result is hardly uplifting, but is at times interesting.  Things get off to a repellant and uneasy start.  The opening music is ridiculous and sounds like it belongs in a Zucker brothers parody or some other spoof.  It's unnecessarily overheated and hyper-dramatic to the point of laughter.  Then the killer (Dukes, who is immediately revealed, so there is no mystery on that level) strikes lethal, bloodless blows while the audience is treated, without warning, to intercut shots of skin and organs being sliced and cut (scenes from the wife's surgery.)  This is purportedly meant to be clever and symbolic, but it's just distasteful and unappealing...an idea that was probably brilliant for the best-selling book on which this film is based, but doesn't work as well on film.  From there, Sinatra, with the help of some unlikely assistants, works to track down the killer while maintaining a bedside vigil over his wife.  Sinatra gives a very low-key performance, at times to the point of near woodenness, but his presence is so strong that he escapes with his dignity mostly intact (his shifting, Friar Tuck toupee is not exactly an asset.)  Fortunately, he's surrounded by lots of colorful and chatty New York caricatures who take over the verbal action much of the time.  Dunaway was roasted for her sometimes hysterically funny work as the dying wife.  The part is awful, she is 26 years younger than Sinatra which doesn't help, and she has to endure a variety of horrific, inconsistent make-up and lighting effects.  Something that is her own fault is the use of her pet costume designer Theoni V. Aldredge who was responsible for making Dunaway look ridiculous in several late 1970's films (The Champ and Eyes of Laura Mars in particular.)  Here, Aldredge dreams up a jaw-dropping, endless array of ugly, pale nightgowns which do nothing to suggest the artist character that Dunaway is playing.  Dunaway's actual acting is effective at times, eye-bugging at others...anything to make an impression in her scant screen time.  If this is what she was being offered, no wonder she did Mommie Dearest a year later!  The role should have been cast with an older, strong, but less box office actress than her (Lauren Bacall, Janet Leigh?)  Dukes has his own moments of hilarity as the deranged killer.  Though he is obviously acting his behind off, he comes off as a dangerous, unhinged Pee Wee Herman a lot of the time.  What makes the film interesting is the observation of Sinatra's struggles to get anything done in a mostly uncaring world.  He is powerless to save his wife and, if he follows the rules, is powerless to stop Dukes' rampage.  Great acting support in his cause is provided by Whitmore as a cranky coroner, Gabel as a fussypants museum archivist and Vaccaro as the wife of one of the victims.  To reiterate What worked in the book just doesn't happen correctly on film.  For this story to have proper flow, the wife's role should have been incidental, even comatose, and not have as much screen time.  Every time Sinatra makes a stop at the hospital, the film goes off into la la land.  **SPOILER**  Though Sinatra obviously, pointedly  realizes at the end of the film that his wife has expired, Dunaway is clearly seen breathing (not lightly!) right up till the credits!  This is an amazingly sloppy bit of acting and directing/editing and threatens to ruin the entire denouement!
