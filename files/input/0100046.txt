It's not being said to make people feel guilty over something that they probably never took part in, but to educate people in what most public school systems DON'T teach about.  As someone of primarily Native American descent who considers themselves pretty educated about Black history, I myself was very shocked and saddened at the brutality that Black Americans had to face (and still do at times).  A picture (or movie) is worth a thousand words.  This movie would be educational to everyone who views it.  I would definitely recommend this movie to others.

Her changed attitude comes about as a direct result of her Black maid, a woman of deep moral principles named Odessa Cotter (Whoopi Goldberg).Odessa normally would take the bus to work. But she supports the boycott, and therefore chooses to walk the long distance from her shabby house to the manicured, suburban Thompson home. Yet, despite several incidences wherein Southern whites display their hatred of the boycott and of Blacks in general, Odessa, with the support of her own family and her religious faith, maintains a respectful and thoughtful attitude toward Miriam and the Thompson family. The story is told in retrospect, from the viewpoint of Miriam's daughter, Mary Catherine (Lexi Randall), who was seven years old at the time.There is nothing subtle about this slow paced story. It is forceful and frank. The overt hatred by Southern whites toward Blacks is palpable. In no character is this odious racial superiority more evident than in Miriam's cigar chomping brother-in-law, Tunker (well played by Dylan Baker).But Miriam and Odessa relate to each other as individuals, not as members of some group. Perceptive and sensitive, Miriam comes to understand that Southern racist attitudes, those feelings and emotions she grew up with, are passed down through generations. You just don't question it, she tells Odessa, apologetically.Both Miriam and Odessa are multi-dimensional and sufficiently unique to give the story depth of characterization. The acting is fine. Whoopi Goldberg in particular gives a great performance, along with the always reliable Sissy Spacek. The film's production design and period costumes are credible. Lighting is subdued. I liked the background gospel music, but I could have wished for even more. We're Marching To Zion not only is a great gospel hymn; it's also the film's theme.Technically well made, The Long Walk Home has value mostly as historical perspective on an important contemporary social issue. As such, the film's message is just as relevant now as it was fifty years ago.

They had lives to lead and families to raise and the film focuses on their daily living and how they lived it with this larger situation going on around them.This choice of direction brings us into the story much quicker because it focuses on the people and the impact the situation has on them.What stays with me is the subtlety and how small gestures can have a great impact.My favorite movies are about people.

I don't how people could tolerate such brutality and quasi-fascism like Whoopi Goldberg's character had done in the movie. Nothing is neither sugar-coated nor pious and romanticized for your viewing pleasure. In the Long Walk Home, you can feel the hell of the Black residents especially the maids and midwives right down to their aching feet. You can feel the anger and hurt and fear of Cotter's children when they were encountered and attacked by three racist youths in a city park. You sense the burning hatred of white community ready to counteract the issue of Civil Rights and the bus boycott during Christmas dinner where the senior Mrs. Thompson clearly spewed her bigoted opinion at the table and at the very end of film not only that you felt like you were one of the protesters there on the scene, being taunted and insulted. Spacek's character shows a glimmering sense of naivet√©, intelligence, a sense of hope and influence that the resistance to segregation had on a growing number of whites at that time. However, it seems to me that she is the token white sympathizer that most of these films have, although necessary. It's sad to see only the younger Mrs. Thompson and her daughter the only non-racist white people in the entire movie who bothered to question the segregationists. Sometimes movies like these are too brutal for the senses. It makes you ashamed that you live in America. It could be a little too overpowering. Therefore, why couldn't the director add a little sour cream into this 7-alarm chili by adding a scene in which Mrs. Thompson is not the only non-racist by have other women and children explain why they do the racist taunts and bullying because they if they don't join in the bullying festivities then they'll become targets/victims just like Mrs. Thompson and the Cotters.The characters for the most part were very convincing three-dimensional people, not stereotypes, clich√©s, thrown into the mix to inform the audience You are in 1950's Alabama! The dialog has a tendency to punch your face and grab hold while doing so, refusing to be politically correct and soothing. This movie makes shocks you, intrigues, and makes you angry at all almost every other white person in the film. And it will! Trust me! LWH has the power and the punch and accuracy that the rather corporate -sponsored high school history lesson with a Disney Channel heart Ghosts of Mississippi seemed to be lacking.

I watched this in U.S. History class and I wasn't expecting much from it. The true story civil rights movement genre is prone to a lot of problems with being biased, unrealistic, and overly dramatic. Also, the movie of this genre I'd seen most recently was Selma Lord Selma (the Disney one, not the one that came out this past winter) and it delivers one the worst possible versions of the civil rights movement. However, The Long Walk Home gave me a pleasant surprise by cutting down on the genre clich√©s for the most part. It isn't perfect, but there isn't too much to improve on.The primary thing that sets this apart from other black history movies is that it's character driven rather than event driven. Usually the story is weakened by the less cinematically pleasing sequence of historical events that the movie is based on. Here the story was more concentrated onto a few individuals and was driven by their interactions. The only real historical event depicted was the climax with the white mob. This was main thing that made this movie good instead of great for me, because the whole climatic scene felt pretty clich√©d. I know that it would have been a big deal and involved a lot of courage, but it still turned me off a bit.The two main characters are Odessa Cotter, the black maid, and her white employer Miriam Thompson. Miriam is probably the more prominent character because of her arc from indifference to support of the boycott. Odessa joins the boycott by walking to work every day and doesn't go through any change, but remains a solid and believable character. Miriam's husband Norman and his brother Tunker are the antagonists of sorts since they oppose the boycott. The other minor characters consist of Miriam's daughter, who is also the narrator, and Odessa's husband and three kids. The way Miriam and Norman are written are what really set this movie apart for me. I had kind of been thinking that the southern white population of the time would have a bigger reason for segregation than blind racism, and Miriam and Norman provided the answer. Neither of them are really racist, but Norman's fear of the general white population pressures him into joining the anti-black movement. Similarly, Miriam's fear of Norman leads her to remain neutral, and therefore safe, in matters of race. I thought that was great, not only because it made for better characters, but also because it showed the white population's faults without completely demonizing them. That's not to say that racism isn't wrong, but it does show true racial equality.The script was pretty well written in terms of having a good story structure, B+ dialogue, and not going overboard or holding back too much with the discrimination scenes. The acting was fair, and might even be disappointing since you have a couple of bigger name actors. I don't know how historically accurate it was, but I doubt there are any inaccuracies that will make people mad.The movie doesn't make any huge anti-racism statements. Racism isn't completely gone in America in the sense that blacks are still generally associated, whether justly or not, with the more run down and dangerous neighborhoods. That said, I think most American's can agree that racial equality has and is becoming more prevalent.So if you want a civil rights movie, I would recommend this more highly than most. There's a lot of dialogue, which might be something to be conscious of. It's not bad as a family movie. There's a little violence and obviously a bit of racial profanity, but nothing you can't let your fourth or fifth grader watch. So give it a shot unless you absolutely hate historical movies. Overall Rating 7.4/10.

Taking place during the bus boycott of 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, maid Odessa Cotter (Whoopi Goldberg) resolves to walk but her employer Miriam Thompson (Sissy Spacek) decides to drive her for at least a couple of days of the week to her house. I'll stop there and just say this was quite an inspiring, if intense, drama about how oppressive it could be during that time if you were not only the wrong color but also the wrong gender, that is, if you weren't a white male. I mean, the way Miriam's husband Norman (Dwight Schultz) and his younger brother Tunker (Dylan Baker) felt threatened by the whole thing makes one wonder. And the way Odessa's teen kids, Selma (Erika Alexander) and Theodore (Richard Habersham) were almost completely defeated by those white teen boys definitely gave me a pause. Not to mention how openly bigoted Miriam's mother (Gleaves Azar) said her opinion in front of the help was so blatantly appalling to see. What gives one hope is not only the way Miriam and Odessa communicate with each other, but also the way the narration of the grown Thompson daughter Mary Catherine (voice of Mary Steenburgen, Lexi Randall as a child) assures us how poignantly inspiring the whole time was. So on that note, The Long Walk Home gets a high recommendation from me. P.S. Ving Rhames-several years before his star-making turn in Pulp Fiction-portrays Odessa's husband Herbert with hair. Richard Habersham was Eddie in Do the Right Thing the year before. Younger brother Franklin was played by Jason Weaver who would later be the singing voice of Young Simba in The Lion King. He's also, like me, a Chicago native. And Erika Alexander would become Cousin Pam on The Cosby Show after making this.

The actors chosen (especially Goldberg and Spacek) did their jobs extremely well, and the movie contained the subtle comparison of black families to white ones.The film's plot, set during a Montgomery bus boycott led by none other then Martin Luther King Jr himself, is historically accurate and emotionally involving--at the end of the film the audience find themselves angry and confused and relieved all at the same time. Overall, the movie, though not merited much by action scenes or intensely dramatic turbulence, is definitely worth seeing.

Usually, movies in history class could put you right to sleep. However, this one was much, much different.  For the first time, everyone in class was awake and watching the television screen.  It was an amazing movie that really helped us better understand what life was like during the bus boycott.  I had never thought that blacks would have trouble getting rides then--I just never thought about it from someone else's angle before.  This movie really helped me understand a different time period.  When the bell rang to go to next period, most of the class stayed and lingered a few minutes to catch the end of the movie.  A few of us even had tears in our eyes.  Don't miss this movie--it is fantastic.

I have always been bought up in mixed society and looked at everyone the same but to see this movie and see how people were treated was a real shock to the system.Direction/acting was all spot on and you really do feel for the cast in a lot of the scenes.Probably would not recommend this film to everyone, however i would class it as a worth see if you flick past it on the TV.

It wasn't right for black people, to be treated, because they're different. They should have the same rights, to ride the bus, vote and attend school. The 1960's were when the civil rights took place. The country was changing. Blacks have always voted here in Arkansas, even before my time. I didn't like Sissy's husband's brother, who was a bigot. I'm glad he slugged him, for slapping his wife. "}]
