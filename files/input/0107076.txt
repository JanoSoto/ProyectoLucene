Jesus wept, what the hell does it matter whether such is possible or not? Is the freeway chase in THE MATRIX or TERMINATOR 3 likely? We go to the movies primarily to be entertained....to take a step into a world where reality takes a rain-check half the time! HARD TARGET is right up there with Van Damme's best work, and yes he DOES work. Personally I consider it his best film. Being Woo's first American outing, he creatively put a lot into this. Although scaled down, I found it equally as entertaining as FACE OFF, which like BROKEN ARROW, offered insane, impossible but FUN action sequences.HARD TARGET is a stylistic film that although admittedly ripped off from THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (but so too was THE RUNNING MAN and DOGBOYS) delivers some superb sequencies. Van Damme is NOT wooden, he's not one half-bad Cajun with a real bad attitude. Matter of fact, HARD TARGET succeeds because it has that one vital spark necessary to any worthwhile flick - interesting characters!  Vosloo (Before THE MUMMY) is absolutely great as Henriksen's right hand man. A professional killer with no shred of decency.  Er, thats what a killer is SUPPOSED to be!  When he utters that line Randall, Randall, Randall! you just know that Randall is about to have a real bad day! Henriksen chews up the film as the soul-less Fouchon....he even goes out with class... Oops!Yancy Butler is not one to ignore either. Spunky little thing who took her charisma to another level in DROP ZONE! And dear old Wilf Brimley as Chance's reliable and feisty Uncle. He almost steals the film.If you don't like this one you're really hard to please and if you wanna complain about Van Damme's acting again? for God's sake go watch THE ENGLISH PATIENT.

It is! BUT, it is also a very entertaining film, kind of ripoff of the old Most Dangerous Game storyline....and, if you can suspend belief for 90-100 minutes, you'll be vastly entertained....and that's the name of the game, folks.Some of the action scenes are outrageous and big-time Rambo mentality, meaning an entire arsenal that could wipe out a small country is used against our hero and never seems to kill him! People are being shot in the streets but no is ever around in the middle of the day but the killers and victims? Usually that stuff annoys me, but I didn't seem to mind in this movie. In fact, it fits.Despite the lack of credibility, Van Dame standing on top of a speeding motorcycle as it heads towards an onrushing car, and later dodging all kinds of pretty neat weapons as he tries to help Yancy Butler, is just fun. John Wood-directed films tend to be ridiculously exaggerated and loud, so that's what you get. I am not a fan of many of his films, but I am of this one. It's pure macho madness with a Lance Henriksen doing what he does best be an incredibly-nasty and brutal villain. An added bonus in here - a real hoot - is old man Wilfred Brimley as Van Damme's French uncle who comes to his nephew's aid.Add a great blues soundtrack and you have a great film to feed your male hormones with when needing to be fed some gratuitous violence.

Lance Henriksen is great as Fouchon and Arnold Vosloo equally as good as accomplice Van cleef.

Hard target was shoot with very little time and then re-edited 7 times (count'em- seven!) to finally pass the censorship (yes, I'd call it that!) and STILL, after assumably at least half (?) the flavour taken out, it's still one tough cookie! Maybe frustrated at the censorship, Woo has later on stayed on the safe R-rated waters in Hollywood, not even trying to top himself (And again, STILL remaining the best bet when it comes to directing some serious action!)Hard Target puts Jean-Claude Van 'Damage' against one of the always trustworthy screen villains, Lance Henriksen, and his pack of urban-commando (all black outfits, combat vests and MP5's) goons, and that's all you need to know! IF you think the going gets a little boring on the way, wait for the final 20 minutes, which will give you an adrenaline rush worth your while!BTW, if anyone knows where I could get my hands on the 116-minutes (any shorter will not do!) uncut Director's cut, I'd be happy to buy a copy, preferably DVD (but also VHS will do; we're talking cult classic here!)

It is far from this, but only if you see the full uncencored version, which is available in the UK for people who own PAL video machines. I think that this is John Woo's best American made work. Better than Face / Off, which was well filmed but lacked the Woo stylised violence to keep your interest up. But Hard Target has plenty. Certain people believe that the end gunfight in the Mardi Gras graveyard is among Woo's best visually. The flurry of quick bloody violence is overwhelmingly adrenaline pumping, Van Damme pumps the bad guys with more bullets in 15 minutes than Desperado did in two hours! The American Version is quite mediocre compared to the UK version, the US version contains less violence and if you look in the goofs section most of the stuff ups are due to the violence being edited out. I do know where you can get your hands on a rough cut of the 116 minute version but it is a bit of a waste of time, due to the fact that there is no colour (except a greeny tone) and most of the 20 minutes extra are just talking.If you think Van Damme is a bit of a let down, he isn't really. He may not be able to act, but Woo has made him look as cool as ever, seing Van Damme run around with two hand guns is cool, This movie runs on Van Dammes precence.Give this film a chance, get the UK version for a better time.I give this 5 outta 5.John Woo rules the earth.

His first film, Hard Target, came out in 1993, to minimal critical and popular success. Many criticized Woo, and it took him over 3 years to put out another movie, Broken Arrow (1996). It wasn't all Woo's fault. For one, during filming, Jean Claude Van Damme wouldn't listen to his directing. Yancy Butler once said John would tell him to use the guns, but Jean would just go back to kicking. Woo found interesting ways to counteract this, and invented a awesome combo of martial arts and gunplay. Woo finished principle photography, then the movie was edited and submitted to MPAA for rating. The movie was issued a NC-17. Woo wasn't happy, but agreed to trim down some of the violence, and that he did. The movie was reissued, but still not refused. Universal Studios then took the film, cut it themselves, not trying to fight the MPAA, and released it. Some violence was trimmed (more arrow hits in Binder's death and some people being shot more than shown), and a sex scene was removed as well. The movie is still Jean Claude's best and one of Woo's best. The martial arts scenes are excellent, as is the gunplay. Jean Claude has one of the greatest stunts in history involving a truck, a motorcycle, and a flip. As for the plot, nothing special, just a new version of The Most Dangerous Game. Good acting from Van Damme (!), Butler, and Lance H. make it easier to swallow as well. All in all, it getsSeven outta Ten.        P.S. Here's to hoping they release a director's cut DVD!

Today! Take on a new and different approach. If you don't know what that means, John studied Dance, the flowing Asian style dancing and has used it, (I guess like football players study Ballet) using it in the shoot-outs and fighting scenes to add an element of grace and flowing movement to the stories's scene. Thank God, that he didn't do the camera-shot over kill thing with the story and the shoot-out confrontation scenes in this. But as for this action story, I was all for this one! I truly enjoyed all the characters right down to the 'crooked' medical examiner, with the stress related nervous cough. The sleaze-bag o peddler, getting homeless to distribute his business sleazoid 900 number pamphlets, door to door no less. It won and award and was nominated 5 more times! I liked Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude) in this New Oleans feature, he really came through. Next to the movie that a late friend of mine wrote (TIMECOP 1994) this has got to be the most powerfully enjoyable bang-up Van Damme movie, that exists, I say.The area is questionable and dirty, some of it's residents are seedy in operation, yet there is a certain beauty that surrounds them in Oleans. Bravo for the cast of outstanding players, Henrikson as the primary villain, I loved that about this movie, he plays the piano in the movie beautifully, for real, on reel. Mr. Vasloo before 'Titanic' he is a great villain partner, who is agile and deadly. The chase is on and they are all scrambling to stay alive and out of destruction's pathway. The accent from Van Damme, which is always with him, was an irreplaceable addition, to the taste and the culture of the country there. The music, yeah, it was the right music for the job! Playin' C.C.R how ya not gonna love that, when you're all the way down there? Jean Claude had just come into his-'own'acting craft style but, did not seem to go on above it too far after 'Hard Target' was made. His career seemed to settle down not too many years after as well. Although he is still making movies, some aren't bad either. He is a decent action hero, that can do different roles, with a good but limited ability.But for this Woo film, I am applauding his best efforts, he stayed on a strong course with it, fine, fine actors and a good and gritty dirt in your teeth type of story, that brought Wilford Brimley as the wilderness 'Uncle' . The uncle with the explosives! Where was he when I was growing up? I could have really used em'. I rated this one highly, and recommend it as a great kicker of a fast paced manic action movie! Four kicks!!!!

And the factor behind these? John Woo! John Woo has proven himself the answer on providing greatness to Van Damme, and it's obvious that Van Damme's films that followed, simply lacked goodness.With Woo on the helm, we get to see Van Damme doing those Woo signature-action like double-gun firing, action slow-mo, dangerous stunts, revealing views, and the back-to-back 2 side camera view...you name it. Van Damme himself said that this was the most creative action film he's ever done, and you'll see why.Regarding the story, the plot seemed simple on paper but John Woo added twists and gimmicks to transform the simplicity into interest. The cast is highlighted by Lance Henriksen's role as the bad boss, and he adds quality acting and voice to this film. Yancy Butler however, does not make a good lead lady here, and I always thought of other actresses replacing her.John Woo's action scenes are very defined here, and thanks to those slow-mo scenes, you get to see Van Damme REALLY HIT HIS ENEMIES...as opposed to seeing him move too fast in other films, which made you wonder if his kicks were real or not. In addition, he did some dangerous stunts on his own, which adds authencity to his action figurre. Van Damme needs to team up again with Woo. The films that followed this were simply lacking of quality (The Quest) or lousy (Double Team). It's easy to realize that Hard Target is more of a John Woo-film than a Van Damme-film. Van Damme, in my opinion, is better-off with Woo as director simply because his best is brought out. Since this film is Woo's US debut, this film is like a preview of things to come...meaning Broken Arrow, Face/Off and the ongoing blockbuster Mission Impossible II! You'll really see how far Woo went from this debut.Definitely worth watching! Hard Target is not John Woo's best, but it's Van Damme's best film ever! This is where you see Van Damme in his greatest action, and thank Woo for that!

It stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lance Henriksen, Yancy Butler, Arnold Vosloo and Wilford Brimley. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.New Orleans and ex-merchant marine Chance Boudreaux (Damme) is struggling to gain employment on account of some muscular indiscretions. However, after saving Natasha Binder (Butler) from the hands of robbers, he is offered some work by her that pays handsomely. The task is to find out where her father is, a homeless ex-forces man who has mysteriously disappeared. It's a search that leads them to a sick urban safari being run by Emil Fouchon (Henriksen), the prey? Man!After pushing the boundaries of action cinema in Hong Kong, it was only a matter of time before John Woo got lured to America to dabble in the dollar. Hard Target was his first American movie, which in spite of the studio being nervous about his hiring (Sam Raimi was on standby should it implode) and cuts being made on demand for a certificate rating to open it up to a wider audience, it worked out well. It was a financial success, even though there was the inevitable mixed reviews from critics and today it rightly is held in high regard amongst action movie die- hards.OK! Nobody could seriously claim it's a titan of cinema, it's an absurd story derived from The Most Dangerous Game, the acting is of the usual Van Damme kick assery standard (JC pouts and mumbles, Butler is terrible, Brimley is miscast, Henriksen so over the top we almost lose him from our vision) and preposterousness reaches new levels. Yes it's a dumb fun action movie where leaving the brain at the door is a requisite. But what action delights await the faithful, what grace and style does Woo bring to the mayhem, it's a visceral thriller that once it gets the plot initiations out of the way, unleashes beautiful carnage that thunders the chest royally.Can violence be lyrical? In Woo's hands yes, certainly. The action film is one of the most maligned in cinema, but there is great artistry to many of them, to that end Hard Target scores incredibly high. The stunt work is amazing, the choreography of the fight scenes, with Van Damme showing his wonderful skills, are exquisite sights for the action film fan. Woo's tricks involving slow-mo, freeze frames and juddering close ups all get worked out here, quite often forming part of another ballet of bloodshed. Woo and Van Damme were a good fit, the film rocks for those so inclined for such kinetic malarkey, and not even The Muscles from Brussels' mullet can spoil the enjoyment. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Maybe Van Dammes best action flick","Date":"2 July 2003","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  	This is one of Van Dammes better films.

He doesn't look like him and the hair piece on him looks like he's wearing a coon skin cap.

She checks with his now wife, being that he broke up with Natasha's mother when she was a child, and she learns that he lost his job at the factory where he was working. She enlists the help of a female police officer who tells her to check at the homeless shelters. She checks there, but to no avail. She does, however, meet a man named Elijah Roper (Willie C.

He tells her that if he sees him, he'll let her know.After being hasselled by some men, she is aided by Chance Boudreaux, a seamen who works down at the docks. Needing someone to help her find her way around the city, she enlists his reluctant help, by offering him a few hundred dollars, which he needs to ship out fro the docks, or else his boss won't let him. Chance and Natasha stumble upon a deadly game of cat-and-mouse where men with no visible family are given a money belt, and given a designated area to get to. Get there, keep the money.

However, I caught this one and I have to agree that this one does stand with Die Hard and Lethal Weapon as an action classic.  John Woo's first American film is probably my favorite of his (aside from Face/Off) and his talent really shines through and makes the film.  The pace is tight and constantly moving and whenever the action scenes come in, their beautifully done, and helped out by a nice cajun/blues flaovored score.  I really liked Chance's theme music.The cast is perfect for this kind of movie with the ever-reliable Lance Hendrickson playing the rich-boy baddie who gets his thrills (and his cash) from hunting down and killing bums.  He plays a heartless fellow in this one and he's good at it.  Arnold the mummy Vosloo, plays his sidekick Van Cleef and delivers an equally evil performance.  I guess my favorite was Wilford Brimley as Chance's uncle. The man is great.If I can enjoy this movie enough to watch it more than a couple of times (which I have), then I'm sure that almost anyone can.  It's a very admirable effort from one of Hollywood's most gifted and original directors and it is sure to please more than just fans of the genre. The only thing that may turn some people off, is the graphic violence.  No, it's not quite a gore-fest, but still, some of the scenes are pretty harsh and wouldn't fare to well for the squeamish.  I'm mostly talking about the hunting scenes.    Good stuff here, now if I could just find the unedited Laserdisc, I'd be in Heaven...

This was Woo's first American film, dealing with a group of rich businessmen that pay to hunt homeless men across urban wastelands.  When Van Damme gets involved he himself becomes hunted until he turns the table on the hunters!The main problem with this is that it feels like Woo-lite.  It only has occasional touches that make you realise that it's a John Woo film.  In terms of being a Van Damme movie this stands out as one of his better projects, despite the terrible haircut he has to wear all through it.The story is quite lame and you don't get that excited about it.  The action scenes are good, although some of them are not at Woo's level.  Van Damme's performance is as wooden as it always is and he only really does well in the action scenes, Henriksen is good as the bad guy and hams it up accordingly and Vosloo is good as his side-kick, however the majority of performances are only so-so (but then this is an action movie after all!).Overall the film is a solid action flick but lacks the full stylistic touch of Woo. "},{"Title":"Competent action thriller","Date":"2 July 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" As with many action movies, Hard to Kill's strengths and weaknesses are fairly simple to analyse. It's a competent action thriller, notable for some stylish action scenes that have John Woo's touch; one particularly memorable example is when Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) quite literally blasts a bikie thug out a window with a shotgun and a petrol can! These moments pretty much make the film worth seeing by themselves, despite the usual weaknesses in the plotting and JCVD's ever wooden countenance. As JCVD himself noted however, viewers paid the money to see him waste bad guys and he does plenty of this - sometimes in more inventive ways than expected (using snake traps). It very much makes the film worth seeing for action buffs, even though I'm reluctant to give a really high rating based on this alone.The plot is not too extraordinary a homeless veteran gets murdered by a team of mercenaries led by Emil Fouchoud (Henriksen) and Van Cleaf (Vosloo), after which his daughter Nat (Butler) comes looking for him and commissions Boudreaux, a homeless Cajun merchant marine (!) to help her out after he rescues her from marauding thugs, raising the ire of the mercenary team. A few plot holes are obvious (shouldn't this mercenary team have been dealt with a while ago, police strike or not? Why is JCVD made a CAJUN?), but it works well as a vehicle for blowing stuff up and killing people. The dialogue is pretty standard stuff some profanity, some hilariously cringeworthy lines (don't worry about Randall; he's all ears!) and some macho stuff. As for the acting, the villains are better than the heroes. Of course, when JCVD is your hero, that's bound to be the case, with his unconvincing delivery. He has recently shown that he is capable of acting, but he was a long off that in 1993. Still, English is probably his third language (after French and Dutch); Yancy Butler has no such excuses, being quite wooden in a role that doesn't demand that much. Vosloo and Henriksen are much better though. Vosloo has that quiet menace that always makes him a good villain, while Henriksen goes from menacing and purposeful to merrily nuts as Boudreaux causes him more difficulties than expected. Even Wilford Brimley is amusing as Chance's crazy uncle, reeling off some zany lines. In the end, Hard Target is not a great movie, but it's a competent action thriller with some nice stylistic touches from John Woo during the action scenes. Henriksen, Vosloo and Brimley compensate somewhat for JCVD and Butler, but you still shouldn't watch this film for the acting and especially not for the plotting. Action fans generally don't really look for either that much though, so that's alright. Movie-goers looking for a bit more will probably like some of the style, but won't find that much else.3/5 stars "},{"Title":"One of the best Van Damme movies.","Date":"20 November 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" First saw this movie when i was buying a video of Maximum Risk,which is a decent Van Damme film.So i watched this film and was not disappointed,i was entertained throughout the whole movie.The action was practically non-stop.The storyline is decent enough with ruthless business men hunting homeless war veterans,and the street-wise Chance Boudreaux was going to find out sooner or later,to bad for the bad guys.The action scenes are spot on.When Van Damme first appears,you just know the s**t is going down.In roughly the first half hour of the film sees a fight at a café in which Van Damme breaks a guys arm it is brutal.As the film rolls on,we discover Chance's background and how he himself has experienced the streets.Lance Henrickson is great as the Emil Fouchon chief bad guy,you just love to hate.And Arnold Vosloo as his sidekick Pick Van Cleef was great and funny at times.You just know when he utters the words Randall,Randall,Randall that Randall was in for a very bad day.Wilford Brimley as the enjoyable and funny uncle Douvee.The tag-line for this movie is Don't Hunt What You Cant Kill and the bad guys should have realised this.This is a decent and enjoyable Van Damme film.

As it turns out, her father isn't missing, necessarily, he was a victim of a malevolent gang of human hunters. Led by Fouchon (Henriksen), and with his second in command Pik Van Cleef (Vosloo), they get their kicks (and get rich) letting weekend warriors pay them to go on the ultimate hunting expedition for man! But they meet their match with the fearless Chance, a man they cannot kill. Along for the ride is Chance's uncle Douvee (Brimley). Will Chance get his chance at glory? Or, to the human hunters, is he just another HARD TARGET?Hard Target is hands-down one of Van Damme's best. It's explosively entertaining and lives up to the promise of a Van Damme and John Woo team-up. It's everything a combination of those two men could be and should be, and doesn't let the audience down.Once again, this is classic 90's action fun from the golden time when Van Damme movies went to the theater. Back then, we remember joking with our friends that because there's so much slow motion in this movie, if it was all played at regular speed, the film would be about 20 minutes. And it's true, there is a lot of dramatic slo-mo, but it's all for the best. And Van Damme and others get a lot of unnecessarily portentous entrances and exits, which just adds to the style of Hard Target, which is just a tad bit off-kilter. But that's far from a bad thing. It separates itself from its many competitors that way.Besides Van Damme and his absurd hair, the cast assembled for this is just killer Lance Henriksen is great as the baddie who's so bad, even his piano-playing is evil. Vosloo is also adept at being bad, and his quasi-Scottish (?) accent, well, accentuates his sinister glares. Yancy Butler gives a bug-eyed performance who always seems surprised at the proceedings. But top marks must go to the great Wilford Brimley. In a strange role for him, the barely-intelligible, bow-and-arrow toting, horseback riding uncle is truly lovable and you root for him, even though he doesn't appear until late in the film. That's a tribute to Brimley that the audience can grow to love him so quickly. This movie puts a twist on the time-honored Most Dangerous Game (1932) idea. The formula's been tried before, with varying degrees of success, in everything from Death Ring (1992) to Avenging Force (1986). But Hard Target has plenty of awesome moments, including the extended climax in (what else) an abandoned warehouse. Never one to be afraid of wasting bullets, Woo pulls out all the stops in an extended feast of overkill. It's over-the-top fun everyone should see.On a technical note, the British DVD is longer than the American cut, including more violence. So try to track that down if you can, for the complete picture.Go down to the bayou tonight for some high-octane, high-quality Van Damme at his absolute best.For more insanity, please visit comeuppancereviews.com "}{"Title":"Had potential","Date":"17 December 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" HARD TARGET (1993) is a stylish, B-grade action/thriller directed by Hong Kong director John Woo (his first U.S. film).Hard Target stars Jean Claude Van Damme as an ex-military loner named 'Chance' whose ordinary life as a merchant sailor is interrupted by 'Natasha' an attractive innocent (Yancy Butler) who's come to New Orleans to look for her father.Unbeknownst to Natasha, her father (played by Hard Target's scriptwriter) became homeless and was enlisted by a group of ruthless entrepreneurs that organise human 'hunts' for the pleasure of privileged individuals. Hard Target's first half has a certain amount of depth and social conscience (for an action film). For instance, a homeless man 'Roper' (Willie C. Carpenter) is gunned down in public after no one will help him. But Hard Target's second half (where it moves from the city to the swamps) degenerates, at times into downright silliness and has a rushed feel. The finale in the abandoned warehouse filled with old Mardi Gras paraphernalia was meant to be somehow meaningful, but it's not; it's just a finale in an abandoned warehouse filled with old Mardi Gras paraphernalia.Hard Target is a reworking of a much earlier film 'The Most Dangerous Game' (1932) about humans who kill humans for sport. However, I believe Hard Target got ideas from the James Bond film 'Moonraker' (1979); check out the scene where Jaws chases Bond's contact through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Hard Target's scriptwriter (Chuck Pfarrer) probably thought no one would notice.Although it doesn't excuse Hard Target's failings, Woo was reportedly forced to edit Hard Target because of the violence (and it was edited again by Universal Studios).Hard Target was later released on DVD with most of the action and violence restored. Hard Target's still not as violent as some of Woo's earlier Hong Kong efforts e.g. 'The Killer' (1989), 'Bullet in the Head' (1990) and 'Hardboiled' (1992).And since Woo's action films rely on shoot'em ups which would be too violent for a mainstream U.S. film, Hard Target suffers accordingly. Although Woo's vision may have been compromised and even with most of the action and violence restored, Hard Target's still at times pretty silly e.g. Chance swinging from ropes in the finale and Chance's hillbilly 'Uncle Douvey' (Wilford Brimley) doesn't help the situation either. And the way some of the less important baddies wear black baseball hats as if they're there just there to be shot, beaten or blown up. Also, there's this flimsy plot device about the New Orleans police department going on strike which head baddie 'Mr Fouchon' (Lance Henriksen) and his team use as their opportunity to conduct a hunt in New Orleans. In 'Robocop' the police strike was plausible because in that film the police had been taken over by a private corporation. But in Hard Target, the police strike doesn't ring true. Hard Target makes attempts at being topical e.g. Mr Fouchon refers to the war in Bosnia as an opportunity that allowed him and his men to conduct some previous hunts; therefore it would've been better if Hard Target had been more even toned and not allowed itself to mix violence with attempted humour. Woo's next U.S. cinema release was the disappointing 'Broken Arrow' (1996) and then the overrated 'Face Off' (1997) followed by the box office flop 'Windtalkers' (2002) and the forgettable 'Paycheck' (2003) then back to China to make the epic 'Red Cliff' (2008).Woo also continued his U.S. career directing a made for TV action flick 'Blackjack' (1998) starring Dolph Lundgren and a two hour pilot movie for the Canadian TV series 'Once a Thief' (1996) which was a reworking and Woo's same titled 1991 Hong Kong movie as well as producing 'The Replacement Killers' (1998) and 'The Big Hit' (1998).Although Hard Target is marred by silliness and implausibility, it's first half has a certain depth. That, coupled with it's polished look; it's style and some of it's action scenes, could lead you to believe you're watching something more than a B-grade action film.If Hard Target had more thought put in and stayed within the confines of the city, it could have stood out as a solid memorable and hard-hitting action film.

Both are extremely long and John Woo style! The first one is more stylish and Woo tried to imitate some images or ideas in his following movies, because it was really good. This sequence starts with an unforgettable event that makes you angry against Cleef. There is a great bike chase scene, he shot a similar scene in Paycheck, but it was nothing. In another scene, Van Damme and Pik Van Cleef shoot each other, but there is a glass wall between. John Woo used this idea in Face/Off, but it was too short (a few seconds!) so unsatisfying.

This was a sleeper hit, when it was release in August of 1993. It is also one of Van Damme's better features (Despite his silly long hair in the picture). The premise is familiar but that's not the problem in Hard Target. Director Woo really went overboard with the slow-motions here, which half of the time wasn't needed. There's moments, because of the slow-motions in the film... it's played for unintentional laughs unfortunately. But Woo certainly knows how to entertained the audiences by creating good action sequences and excitement during the last 40 minutes of the feature.On the two disc set of the recent Quadruple Feature from Van Damme Fight Pack.

The best thing about Hard Target are actually the lead villains played by Herniksen and Vosloo are good in it. It is probably why the producers of the movie... Sean Daniel and James Jacks (They produced entertaining cult features like Dazed and Confused, Mallrats and Tombstone) were impressive with Vosloo to hired him as the main villain in the two Mummy movies.

Fans of Woo's movies will appreciate this more than others.

Although the plot is run-of-the-mill and does somewhat disappointingly dissect the action sequences, it does not really matter because it is the action that is worth waiting for. It is ridiculously over-the-top, in a good way though, violent, entertaining and at times hilarious. Van Damme is actually pretty good in this film, playing a really hard bastard. He is perhaps helped by some decent characterisation, but this perhaps favours the two villains most of all with Henriksen excellent as usual, playing the snarling, evil villain and Vosloo pretty amusing as his cocky, over-exuberant right-hand-man. It helps they are given some decent lines even if the script isn't the most polished in the world but no doubt is it set instead on catering for the action. Although convincingly handled, the action scenes do however, require some suspension of disbelief and a view that doesn't hint towards gritty realism. So what if no one never reloads, so what if the police and public are never around, so what if it takes Van Damme thirty bullets to kill one man, this is simply an action film and nothing can be taken for granted in this genre. Besides if the action is as greatly entertaining and stylistically done as this then you can easily forget the films mishaps and general lack of narrative qualities.7/10 "},{"Title":"Not Woo's best here, but it could've been worse (and better)","Date":"2 July 2002","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  John Woo, after striking gold in action cinema in Hong Kong, came to Hollywood in the early 1990s in search of success here. His first film, Hard Target, came out in 1993, to minimal critical and popular success. Many criticized Woo, and it took him over 3 years to put out another movie, Broken Arrow (1996). It wasn't all Woo's fault. For one, during filming, Jean Claude Van Damme wouldn't listen to his directing. Yancy Butler once said John would tell him to use the guns, but Jean would just go back to kicking. Woo found interesting ways to counteract this, and invented a awesome combo of martial arts and gunplay. Woo finished principle photography, then the movie was edited and submitted to MPAA for rating. The movie was issued a NC-17. Woo wasn't happy, but agreed to trim down some of the violence, and that he did. The movie was reissued, but still not refused. Universal Studios then took the film, cut it themselves, not trying to fight the MPAA, and released it. Some violence was trimmed (more arrow hits in Binder's death and some people being shot more than shown), and a sex scene was removed as well. The movie is still Jean Claude's best and one of Woo's best. The martial arts scenes are excellent, as is the gunplay. Jean Claude has one of the greatest stunts in history involving a truck, a motorcycle, and a flip. As for the plot, nothing special, just a new version of The Most Dangerous Game. Good acting from Van Damme (!), Butler, and Lance H. make it easier to swallow as well. All in all, it getsSeven outta Ten.        P.S. Here's to hoping they release a director's cut DVD!

All his trademarks are here- slow motion action, stylish violence, tough but quiet male characters, and a ruthless bad guy. It is not up the standards of his early work, or as good as Broken Arrow, but with a strong cast it remains a solid action movie and very entertaining for people who like this sort of thing.Van Damme stars as Chance, a tough drifter looking for some work. He sees a young woman being mugged by a gang of crooks and wades in, destroys them without breaking a sweat, and leaves. The young woman, Natasha, played by Yancy Butler is in town trying to find her father who has disappeared. She decides to hire Chance as a protector and help her find her father. They find out that he was homeless and in an attempt to gain some quick cash entered himself in a deadly game run by local sadist Emil Fouchan- Lance Henricksen. He has a team of criminals who are taking advantage of the lax policing in the area, and they hunt helpless humans for sport. He gives his victim the chance to get to a certain point in the city while he chases them with a gun. This is what happened to Natasha's father, and when Chance becomes involved we know there is going to be fireworks.Henriksen here hams everything as the bad guy but is still very good and enjoyable to watch. Van Damme tries to more cool than any of his previous roles and Woo certainly gets good results from him. Butler is excellent as Natasha and steals most scenes, and the rest of the cast is adequate. The action is not as stylish as other Woo films, and we get the sense he is easing his way onto the Western audience. There are some wonderfully over-the-top scenes though, and everything works well. The simple story is also effective, leaving room for the main draw- guns, kicks, explosions, and killings.7.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"John Woo's best American import.....","Date":"14 September 2003","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  Definitely one of the best films of its kind of all time.

And yes, Jean Claude Van Damne is not one of my favorite action stars (Schwarznegger, Stallone, Willis, Snipes, and Seagal all rank above him in my book), this movie is still great.  Van Damne plays Chance Boudreaux, a homeless merchant sailor who teams up with Yancy Butler to solve the case of her missing father.  Turns out, her father had fallen prey to an international baddie who travels around and offers bored rich guys the opportunity to hunt homeless men for thrills.  Lance Henrikson plays the hunter, squeezing as much sleeziness out of the role as possible.  Henrikson's character is aided by his equally-sleezy lackey, portrayed by The Mummy's Arnold Vosloo.  Anyways, Van Damne and Butler soon discover the truth behind Henrikson's little safari game, and they themselves become the hunted.

All of those elements make Hard Target one of the better Action Films of the 1990s that is John Woo and Jean-Claude Van Damme at their best.Set in New Orleans,Louisana,Hard Target tells the story of Chance Doudreaux(Jean Claude Van Damme),who is asked by Natalie Binder(Yancy Butler)to track down her War Veteran Father who is homeless. While looking Chance and Natalie clash with wealthy man Emil Fouchon(Lance Henriksen)who hunts homeless people for sport. Now,it's up to Chance to take down Emil once and for all.Released in 1993,Hard Target is a terrific slam bang Action-Thriller that was a Box Office success for Jean Claude Van Damme and was John Woo's first Action film in America after making brilliant and unforgettable Action classics such as The Killer(1989),Hard Boiled(1992),A Better Tomorrow(1986)and A Better Tomorrow II(1987)in Hong Kong,China with actor Chow Yun Fat. And while Hard Target isn't as good as those films it's an outstanding and memorable movie and is one of the better Action films of the 1990s. For 97 wild and fast paced minutes Hard Target is pure,nonstop entertainment from start to finish and is a film I have always enjoyed and liked ever since I saw it on home video back in the mid-1990s and was the film that introduced me to Action master John Woo and is an Action movie that was made strictly for Action fans and John Woo fans because this movie has all of the trademarks you would see in Woo's Hong Kong films and his later movies such as Broken Arrow(1995)and Face/Off(1997)gun and hand to hand fights,explosions,use of slow motion and an over the top style that just works. Hard Target is the kind of Action movie that never stops to accomplish it's goal and that is to put viewers on the edge of your seat with excitement and thrills and Hard Target does it with a vengeance. It's a shame that John Woo and Jean Claude Van Damme never worked together again because together they seemed like a great fit for each others styles. The main character and hero Chance Boudreaux is a memorable character and an Action hero in the truest sense of the term and is the kind of character where his Actions speak louder than words while having a good mullet. Also,Chance uses his fighting skills and his wits to out do the bad guys who do the bad thing by underestimating and getting in trouble because of it. When Chance beats the bad guys and outsmarts them It's the kind of movie where the storyline isn't always strong and there isn't a lot of depth with the characters there is enough dialog and scenes with the main characters to keep the viewers interested. One of the main reasons to watch Hard Target is the Action scenes. The Action scenes in Hard Target is exciting,intense and is done in the classic John Woo style with attention to detail and where pretty much everything is big whether it's the gunfights(with one and at times two guns)or the explosions(with cars,buildings and at other times with motorcycles)everything in Hard Target is pushed to the limit and beyond like in Woo's Hong Kong films and while the scenery is changed from Hong Kong to New Orleans Woo's Action is still the same. What I also liked about Hard Target is the New Orleans locations which still looked beautiful despite the violence all around. The ending of Hard Target is amazing and filled with tons of Action and excitement that never stops and will have you cheering. A sensational ending.The cast is wonderful. Jean-Claude Van Damme is terrific as Chance,with Van Damme being charismatic and kicking butt at the same time. Lance Henriksen is wonderful and memorable as Emil Fouchon,with Henriksen stealing every scene he's in. Arnold Volsoo is fantastic as Pik,Emil's right hand man. Yancy Butler does a great job as Natasha,a woman who needs Chance's help. Wilford Brimley is outstanding as Uncle Dovee,Chance's Uncle. Kasi Lemmons is fine as May Mitchell,a cop. Willie C. Carpenter is sensational as Elijah,Chance's homeless friend. Chuck Pfarrer(who also wrote the screenplay)is good as Douglas Binder,Natasha's homeless Father.The direction by John Woo is outstanding and stylish,with Woo constantly moving the camera and showing close-ups,zooms and freeze frames while doing a great job with the Action scenes. Amazing direction,Woo.The score by Graeme Revell is fantastic,thrilling and matches the film's tone. Great score,Revell.In final word,if you love Jean Claude Van Damme,John Woo or Action Films,I highly suggest you see Hard Target,an excellent,underrated Action-Thriller that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

After the astonishing success of Bloodsport (reviewed by this humble scribe in the IMDb) the actor, the Muscles From Brussells, banged out two additional films which, added to the aforementioned breakout role, constitute perhaps his true legacy. They were TIMECOP (also reviewed here) and this opus, HARD TARGET. Some might argue that all the films he has done since have only served to cheapen or dilute his body of work. Were he able to respond, I am sure JCVD himself would argue that an actor has to eat, and all those other films served that specific purpose. No matter. Bloodsport, simply one of the best martial arts films of all time. The plot structure could be taught in film school. TIMECOP, one of the smartest riffs on time travel ever, with a performance from JCVD that actually seems more acting than fighting. And HARD TARGET, with the incredible John Woo behind the lens, Yancy Butler (of WITCHBLADE fame, a cult hit) providing the pretty face, and Arnold Vosloo (of MUMMY fame) proving yet again that the South African accent is the scariest dialect on the planet -- you have a recipe for non-stop action, intrigue, fisticuffs, explosions, stunts, general mayhem, and -- to quote a TV show from the 50s -- a rollicking frolicking good time.

It was his first American movie and one must say that in a lot of ways it is a disappointment. I am not saying that it is a bad movie, but it seems that the creative genius that is John Woo is seriously hindered by the capital focus of the American market. Us Westerners like movies with happy endings and movies that do not challenge us to think. This movie is action but its action is not beautifully crafted within a movie with real characters struggling in a real world.Hard Target is set in New Orleans during a police strike, though this does not seem evident. A group has set itself up where they hire vagrants to run 10 kilometers with $10 000 while they are being chased by hunters. These vagrants are not supposed to have any ties, but unfortunately they chose somebody who does. When his daughter comes to New Orleans to find him dead, she starts asking questions, and brings Van Damme in to help her.The plot is good, but the thing with Woo's movies from Hong Kong is that it is about the characters struggling with themselves and the bad guys were simply around to make their life even harder. No such struggle occurs within this movie. Van Damme, who is simply a sailor that happens to be good at martial arts, is not able to play a character with any depth. Personally I do not think much of his acting ability, and people really only watch his movies to see his moves - and they are not even martial arts. The only reason Van Damme can do these moves is because he is a dancer.The movie plasters John Woo as being the director and attempts to attract people to the movie on this fact. The action is good, and the imagery used is typical of John Woo. He is a brilliant director, but is even better when he is not restrained. I feel that this film is let down in the fact that there is no character struggle in this movie. The characters are not anti-heroes, which is one of the aspects that elevates Woo movies above the others. It is not until Face Off that John Woo's American movies began to stand out.There are two things that seem to form a part of Woo movies. The main characters either begin as friends but slowly drift apart until they are fighting each other at the end, or they are apart and through the struggles that they face, they are drawn together and realise that they need to help each other. Face Off is a completely different idea where the good guy suddenly finds that he is the bad guy and cannot do anything about it. A Bullet in the Head, Too Catch a Thief, and Broken Arrow are examples of the first type, while The Killer and Hard Boiled are examples of the second type. Hard Target doesn't fall into either category. The characters do not entertain me as their struggles are purely action orientated and as such it doesn't grab me as Woo's other movies do.

When Natasha Binder comes to New Orleans to find her estranged father she has no idea that her search will lead to the uncovering of a sinister group who are arranging for rich psychotic businessmen to hunt former combat veterans who are down on their luck. Her father was one of their victims and they are determined not to be exposed. Luckily Natasha has employed unemployed veteran Chance Boudreaux to help in her search. When Emil Fouchon, the group's leader learns what Boudreaux can do he decides that he will be their final quarry in New Orleans; Boudreaux is determined to turn the tables though and lures Fouchon and his group into the bayous which is his home territory.This isn't the sort of film that is going to win major awards; it was never meant to be, there are also plenty of times where ones ability to suspend disbelief is stretched to the limit&#x85; that doesn't matter though; this film is all about fighting with martial arts, guns, grenades and even a bow and arrow. Jean Claude van Damme puts in one of his best performances as Boudreaux and Lance Hendrickson is great as usual as Fouchon. Other notable performances come from Arnold Vosloo as Pik van Cleef; Fouchon's South African right hand man and Yancy Butler who looks suitably scared as Natasha. As one would expect from John Woo the action is spectacularly choreographed with plenty of slow motion and John Woo's trademark disturbed doves flying everywhere.

A close second I would place Die Hard 1 or 2 ( either one ) and Steven Segal's Under Siege would take the bronze in my book. Anyhow, going back to John Woo's masterpiece, I know that from a critic's perspective Hard Target falls short in most of the categories by which a cinematic masterpiece is analysed the plot has as many holes as the lunar surface, the characters are weak to say the least and there's no real conclusion to this hole gun duel festival. That being said, I cannot give enough praise to a masterpiece that's rather shaded today. John Woo is a genius, and you can see it here also, it's not just the Matrix style bullet dodging, he knew how to use all the potential in the background story hobos, broken-down veterans, pimps, gangsters, cemeteries and other southern influences which give that romantic feeling and set a perfect world where the hero can steal the show. It's pure edge-of-your seat blockbuster movie. By the way, I'm not as big a Van Damme fan as I used to be when I was a kid, I can see his limitations as an actor almost in his every film, but here, as a french speaker ( his belgian heritage was perfect ) with curls and a rather artistic wardrobe he was awesome (you kinda' get tired of watching his muscles work every second on screen). The villains were also epic in their perticular performances, I have always liked Lance Henriksen. In conclusion, with great sorrow, I'd like to say that they don't make them like they used to, you woun't see this kind of cinema work in our days very often.

And we also have two great villains played by Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo these two have to be the most evil pair of villains to ever be in an action movie as they just show no mercy of torturing or killing people they even make jokes about their victims while killing them.But what really makes Hard Target Special is the action scenes, considering this was John Woo's first American film he really put a lot of work into the action, and he has never repeated the insanity and unrealistic nature of it ever since, and the reason for that is Hard Target was not received well by the critics, the critics complained that it was ridiculously over the top and unrealistic, as well as criticizing the plot, and considering that it was made by John Woo, who's films prior to Hard Target are masterpieces of Hong Kong drama and action, and the critics were just appalled by Hard Target.Overall But I think Hard Target was a great movie, the critics were just expecting way too much, did they not notice that Van Damme was the star?, when you go to see a Van Damme movie you go to see him do what he does best, Beat the Tar out of people, so as a Van Damme movie it's definitely impressive in terms of Quality, The action and stunts are great, the villains are brilliant and the plot may not be original but it holds the movie together nicely, and it's definitely the last of the old school John Woo action style which John Woo had to water down in his later American films Because the critics and some of the general public didn't buy his style of action, But I highly recommend Hard Target for any hardcore action movie fan out there, just sit back relax don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun. 8/10BTW The best version of the film is the Region 2 and Region 4 DVD release as 5 minutes of action has been restored, it may not seem like much but trust me it makes a huge difference especially in the final shoot out. with a good surround sound system it'll be one hell of a ride!. But i just hope that one day we'll get a true director's cut of the film.

It's definitively the best of his Hollywood movies and it might even be his best ever.Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a bad ass as usual. The only difference is that he plays a homeless bad ass in this one. He tries to help Yancy Butler's character find her lost father, who was also homeless. When he turns up dead, Van Damme starts to investigate how he died. He soon finds out that he died in a hunting accident. Thats when the movie really starts to pick up some speed and the second half of the movie is pure action.The main bad guys in this movie are really great. What else can you expect when they are played by Arnold Vosloo and Lance Henriksen. In my opinion Lance Henriksen is one of the most underrated actors out there, and he gives a fantastic performance as the boss in this one. The story is simple but good. Despite being a simple story it is not a story we've seen used over and over again. Even if many movies have had bad guys chasing the good guy, we haven't seen the good guy hunted just for sport all to often.John Woo is a really good action director and that shows in the second part of the movie. Many of the action spots in this movie is copied right out of The Killer and Hard Boiled, which Woo made during his Hong Kong days. It doesn't matter because now we get to see them made with Hollywood money and that is nice when it's done right. I also like the fact that all the stunts look doable, and that is nice compared to the CGI crap they make nowadays.The final shootout is one of the best ever. In this we get to see Van Damme outnumbered 20 to 1 in a old warehouse. That's when we get to see John Woo do his best work. This is the way action movies should be made!

The thing that makes hard target so awesome is that it is truly is a john woo movie ( i hope that you seen the unrated movie). Johh woo directs this movie as if it is one of his hong kong movies, yes i know Van Damme is the star but let's give Van Damme some credit this is his best movie that he has done, no Street Fighter and Universal Soldier 2 or Derailed or... i think i made my point. Van Damme is good in the role and yes he does wear what is maybe one of the worst haircuts in action movie history but he does at least try to act i think that he is trying to do. Yes the movie is a B film but then hey is not Darkman is not True Lies,(really a great action movie but really what in the world is up with that plot) John Woo turns the B story into the film's favor almost giving it a Sergio Leone like feel to it and directing each scene like if it is one of his hong kong movies. The Camera is always on the move the action scene's are directed with care (no Micheal Bay shaking camera work here thank you very much) and the movie is a little slow after the start but really kicks high gear in the movie last hour which is wall to wall violence and bloodshed( which really is not a bad thing). Oh yeah another great thing or not really is the Yancy Butler who really adds nothing to movie but look sad or upset or what ever she trying to do but hey john woo has never truly been a great women director just like sam Peckinpah never was, this is a guy movie and on that note it must be said that Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo who turn such awesome performance's that they are clearly having fun and it seems that they knew that they were filming a john woo movie not a van damme movie.I know that john woo had a budget of around 15 million dollars and woo makes the full use of it. On final note i did say that hard target is or could be the best action movie on the 90's before you people say what the, i know woo directed hard boiled about a year before and that he did face off about 4 years later, but common Hard Boiled is one of the greatest action movies of all time and Face Off is a great movie not just a action movie.Hard Target B+.

That's when I went and bought what are probably his best and most decent movies.I must say Hard Target must be his best ever, followed closely by Wake Of Death and Timecop. Basically it's a remake of The Most Dangerous Game. But, oh boy, it does work as an action film! Had this been directed by somebody else then John Woo, this would have turned out only average for sure! But Woo brings something more to the story and the film, an action style known as heroic bloodshed and it features many of Woo's popular trademarks. Pay attention for overkills, white doves, slow motion and stylistic violence! This films action is like Henriksen described a ballet. It makes this film a piece of art to me.Van Damme is very decent in his role as Chance Boudreaux, who is an ex-recon and silver star. Van Damme certainly convinces. Along for the ride are praised actor Lance Henriksen as the leader of the manhunt operation that hunts poor people who are mostly ex-military and charismatic actor Arnold Vosloo as his sadistic sidekick.

This is a ¨Sui generis¨ version from ¨The most dangerous game¨,it's a vivid recounting of Richard Connell's famed novel ,adapted previously in the 1932 classic(Joel McCrea,Fay Wray) by Ernest B Schoedsack and by Robert Wise titled¨Game of death¨ and by Boulting titled ¨Run for the sun¨with Richard Widmark and Jane Greer.This theme has been filmed many times since and utilized as a plot for countless television and cinema argument.The picture displays suspense,tension,thriller and non-stop action for 94 minutes .Breathtaking set pieces action well staged by John Woo with bound and leaps while are shooting.The film is set in New Orleans streets,marsh,bogs of Louisian and into abandoned factory, where is developed an overlong and incredible final duel.Special mention to pair sadist baddies,Henriksen and Vosloo,they're an excessive maniacal, exaggerated villains,they're the best of the film.John Woo direction is good ,he moves well the camera with spectacular scenes ,but doesn't match with his Hong Kong vehicles(Bullet in the head,The Killer,A better tomorrow I and II),John Woo followed with a successful American career(Broken arrow,Face off,Mission impossible II,Windtalkers).The motion picture will like to Jean Claude Van Damme fans and cinema John Woo-enthusiastic "},{"Title":"Hard 2 please","Date":"2 April 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" You could count on the fact, that many fans would be hard to please.

No, Van Damme is not getting better, but he is getting better movies and better support.This is the American film debut of John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off, Windtalkers). It has a real story, although it has been told about a dozen times beginning in 1932 with The Most Dangerous Game. More rich and bored looking for thrills. This time they are hunting for people - homeless paid to take part in a sport they can't possibly win. Van Damme discovers this while investigating a disappearance for Yancy Butler.

"},{"Title":"Absolute cheese","Date":"5 March 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" John Woo's most... interesting venture into Hollywood was also his first. Now whatever the stories about the making of this film, even if Woo had complete control I seriously doubt the film would have been any better, seeing as though Van Damme didn't develop acing skills until very recently. I actually think that the film would have been worse had Woo had complete creative control - pretty much all the action is excellent and if he had attempted to do anything focusing on performance with JC it would have gone tits up. Therefore - and despite John Woo being my favourite director - I think the Van Damme cut we got instead is the best this film is going to get. Sure there is the work print version which is like twenty or so minutes longer, but (from what I have heard - I haven't actually seen it) only a few minutes of that was action and violence, the rest being character or story driven stuff which, quite frankly, I don't give a smeg about, and which would have been impossible to do with his lead.What we're left with then is a film where Van Damme gets to say really silly things like Now take your pig-stick and your boyfriend, and find a bus to catch whilst posing like a bad dude. Plus he gets to kick the absolute crap out of a lot of people, and shoot even more. Also, about those posing shots, I'm guessing Van Damme had control over the music as well, as it is always guitar masturbation whilst Jean Claude and his mullet look out over the horizon.Some of Woo's trademarks remain however, although some have been modified a bit. The hero dealing vast amounts of death with a pistol in each hand is still there and, shock!, we even see him reload; the explosion propelling someone along the floor ready to murder is there; even the opposite window gunfight from Hard Boiled is there; and even the doves are there, although there is only one and it's a... well, pigeon.Regardless, Hard Target is a truly amazing film about a man and his hair cut fighting a war against cheese. Plus, not only does Lance Henriksen feature prominently, and not only does he have what is probably the best death scene ever, not only that, but his coat catches fire and he keeps on acting, refusing to let petty things such as third degree burns get in his way.Hard Target is without a doubt my favourite of John Woo's American films (even though Face/Off is clearly so much better) and is indeed a personal favourite of mine when it comes to cheese cinema.I think about the only complaint I can muster is that we don't get to see Van Dammes's tight arse.

Before that, I already like Van Damme movies like Kickboxer, Double Impact and Universal Soldier. But this is Van Damme and Action at it's finest. Right after this, I had to see other John Woo classics from Hong Kong like The Killer, A Better Tomorrow and Hard-Boiled (most violent movie ever made) Hard Target was part of the 3-picture deal Van Damme made with Universal Studios in his glory days. The other 2 titles were Timecop and Sudden Death. After that, it went slowly downhill for him (Derailed was the absolute worst). The follow-up to Universal Soldier, The Return was supposed to be his comeback, but flopped at the box-office. His only descent movie in the (what, 8-10 ?) years was Wake Of Death, the rest is forgettable.But back to this action classic action movies will only work if you have great and believable bad guys Lance Henriksen was perfectly cast, as well as Andre Vosloo as the ice cold killer Van Cleaf (his best role to date, and I include The Mummy). The supporting cast was also excellent, the dialogue was great and often darkly funny. The plot was exciting, interesting and very well put together. Director John Woo is famous for his camera angles, his trademarks (twin-gun action, doves which represent peace in war sequences) and of course the action sequences itself. the martial arts scenes were efficient, the stunts on the highway were amazing (hey, it's entertainment, not reality..) and the shootout was -and still is- the most explosive action sequence I have ever seen. After this U.S. debut, Broken Arrow was pretty good, Face\Off was great and I personally liked MI 2, which was somehow overrated, but the final half hour was Woo in top form. T H E D I R E C T O R 'S C U T  Yes, it does exist - The opening scene is different (and better) since the 'montage-mistakes' are now resolved. - The motor chase sequence an extra scene involving a car crash. - A romantic scene between Van Damme and Butler was cut to keep the pace going. - Final shootout some extra scenes can be seen, some depend of what version you have seen there were already different cuts made, depending on where you live. (European was uncut Theatrical, some American versions were cut, German was not cut but plainly Butchered, UK versions were different). - The ending different ending. It was originally redone because it just wasn't Van Damme enough (no final kicks). Personally, I like the Theatrical ending better. Universal still didn't release the Director's Cut (come on, the public DEMANDS it !!) but it can be found on the net. An early Screener, not the best quality, but that's all there is for now. If you like action, but not Van Damme, give this one a change anyway, you will NOT be disappointed...

They give their bored wealthy clients prey to hunt down and kill in this umpteenth variation of The Most Dangerous Game. It's rife with poetic violence thanks to director John Woo's always flashy style, but don't look for some sort of deep, thought-provoking experience because this is the type of genre film bent on showing bodies being shot to kingdom come and lots of slow-motion gunplay with explosions galore. That stuntman for Van Damme is quite amazing although the wig he's saddled with isn't too convincing.Van Damme portrays Chance Bourdreaux, a man who gets involved when assisting Yancy Butler's Natasha Binder..a woman searching for whoever murdered her father. It all leads to Emil's business and how he likes to use those somewhat skilled(..and desperate)in how to survive often finding war vets and the like. What Emil never counted on was a real challenge in Chance who seems indestructible and flat-out hard to kill. Soon, Chance and Natasha are on the lam. Wilford Brimley portrays Uncle Bouvee, a dear ally to Chance and knows how to shoot an arrow from his bow with a marksman's skill.This film has lots of of what you expect from an actioner from a director known for setting up amazing sequences of bullet-infested violence, but there's little real time in this for character development. Seems most of the attention was devoted to how Van Damme could kick a guy while shooting him at the same time, or how to find various ways to shoot a person. Then there's the awesome sequence where Henriksen is really on fire when he removes his coat..THAT was stunning and I personally commend the actor for staying in that moment even as it was life-threatening. Fun, in a brainless sort of way, but doesn't hold up next to Woo's masterworks with Chow Yun Fat, HARD TARGET is merely an ant stomped under foot against HARD BOILED or THE KILLER. Henriksen and Vosloo are great as the heavies, though.

In new New Orleans, she finds out that there is a police strike and the only way to help find out the mystery of who killed her father is to team up with tough guy, Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme). Chance helps her find out that her father has been killed by an orginisation who hunt people down.HARD TARGET is very low on character development (which obviously means that John Woo did not write the film) but with Woo's direction, he makes the film fast paced fun.

It contains decent acting from Van Damme and Lance is awesome as the bad guy. Arnold Vasslo is also enjoyable as a henchmen.

Van Damme looks somewhat bored throughout the film and his lines are sometimes unintentionally funny, but he knows how to deliver with his fight scenes. It's also good to have John Woo when it comes to the shootouts, the final one being very impressive. As I said before the main reason for watching this film should be the action sequences.

This movie reminds me of the much-hated, yet mind-numbingly Hard ass(just like van damme's character is told he is in the movie Cyborg)film Last man Standing.

I love his real stunt action but I've always been ambivalent to his slow motion film style. To me, it slows the pacing and reduces the tension. If done too much, it gives an artificial feel to the action. I often admire the stunt work without admiring the film work. Van Damme is playing a Cajun which excuses his accent somewhat. There is nothing great about the story or the acting. I love some of the stunts but even they start to wear thin.

Of all Van Damme movies this one of his, is the best of Van Damme ever and I absolutely love it to death. It is my John Woo's favorite action flick of all time, that I love to death. This is a prototypical good action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a unforgettable and occasionally with a good storyline. To action junkies, this movie is an easy 9, because the only thing that really matters is that the action is superb and the other elements, if not stellar, don't detract enough from the action to really make a difference. There are no CGI in this movie, the stunts are all performed realistic. The gory violence of Hard Target is a big screw you to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, but these are the same guys who hand out 90% approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge &#x96; The gore in Hard Target isn't just randomly thrown in either. Splitting the difference, I am getting an 10/10 -- an outstanding score. For been so good action movie I am an action junkie myself and I enjoy this film I have always fun with seeing this action packed awesome movie from Hong Kong director John Woo. I love this movie to death it is my favorite action movie!! Hard-Target is the ultimate John Woo / Jean-Claude Van Damme collaboration. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Chance Boudreaux, a former US Force Recon Marine who has fallen upon hard times and who is hired by a woman to find her father who had gone missing in New Orleans. In the course of their search, the two discover they are involved with a deadly game where homeless veterans are used as high-priced prey for hunters. The screenplay was written by Chuck Pfarrer, a former Navy SEAL turned screenwriter. The thrill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug, and the more intense the rush, the higher the price. International superstar Jean-Claude Van Damme teams up with world-famous action director John Woo for this electrifying thriller that WGN Radio hails as Easily one of the year's best films! Van Damme is the target of an evil mercenary (Lance Henriksen) who recruits homeless combat veterans for the amusement of his clients - bored tycoons who will pay a half a million dollars to stalk and kill the most challenging prey of them all Man. Laced with dark humor and slam-packed with electrifying action Hard Target is a must see for action fans.Now, when I say works, I mean launches thousands of bullets, slugs, and explosive projectiles into THIRTY of mercenary tycoons baddies. This film has a RIDICULOUS amount of gunplay. Pretty much everyone you see on screen dies at some point. Those that don't die often come perilously close to dying, before getting up and moving on as if nothing had happened. The gunmen in this film have magical powers that enable them to fire about 100 rounds from a Beretta clip without having to reload. Billy Bob (David Efron) runs while carrying the Street Sweeper and lunches a rocket on the cabin and blows it up. They are gun fire, gun plays, explosions and even martial arts in this action packed style everywhere. For my self I think is one of Jean-Claude Van Demme's best movies he ever made. A lot of people are considering, Bloodsport and Kickboxer of one of his best films, I Consider Hard Target--John Woo Style best!!! Lance Henriksen is very underrated actor of his work for everything he does in his movies, he perfectly executed his character Emil Fouchon as the main villain and a mercenary leader. The man can act and he did a great job, in the warehouse and when was the final showdown between Chance and Emil, Lance Henriksen's coat accidentally caught fire. He never broke character and he continued to act further filming the scene while he pulled off the coat and threw it away. That was just outstanding performance. I enjoy the most famous line from Lance Henriksen's character Emil Fouchon after Uncle Douvee blows his own house with a dynamite and Fouchon says that line to the cowboy standing in front of their car. A f****** buffalo. Arnold Vosloo is also underrated actor who plays Pik van Cleef he did a really pretty good job as the villain and Fouchon second mercenary henchman.The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a movie's typical crazy stuntman; firing the Beretta 92FS 9mm while standing on the seat of a motorcycle and crashes in to the car.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect John Woo-Van Damme style -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and hand guns weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait for the live grenade dropped in Fouchon's pants and the biggest detonation sequence.

I drifted off a bit towards the end, but the whole thing was just superb. If you looked at that script on paper you would just go yeah, and...? but John Woo completely takes it and turns it into something made of fire and music. OK, a lot of it is cheesy, but in an enjoyable 90s way, with probably the most amount of slow-motion I've ever seen in a film, more camera movement than if you attached a GoPro to a excitable puppy for two hours, an incredible number of explosions and some great dialogue (in particular I liked Wakey, Wakey... you fat f***! and You are a f****** buffalo!) Van Damm is excellent. He is really able to handle the emotional side of the story well. Sure, he's not Marlon Brando, but he is WAY better than what passes for an action star these days. I mean he is pretty good at times to be honest, despite having little to work with. Anyway, the main thing is that he kicks a few people really hard and ends up in a vest doing back-flips through fire. I mean that's all that really matters in life, isn't it? Notable castings include Lance Henriksen (an absolute pro), Arnold Vosloo (menacing and really creates a wonderful secondary bad guy), Yancy Butler (gorgeous and exciting) and character actor Wilford Brimley who is doing a French accent so terrible that you would think his prep for the role involved watching the German dubs of the Peter Sellers Pink Panther movies.

Whether it is the killing of an innocent lion Cecil by Walter Palmer or some rich human beings killing other less fortunate human beings, killing in any form is not only unethical but also highly reprehensible. In 'Hard Target', the very act of 'killing' becomes the backdrop of a story about how some ruthless human killers are brought to ruin by a clever fighter who outsmarts them in every possible manner. This is a film about intelligent people. Some intelligent villains who use all their cunning in recruiting innocent victims for their sadistic pleasure. Poverty is a curse for human society. It is evident here in full force as poor homeless people are trapped by rich people to sacrifice their lives for a handsome amount of money. The screenplay of this film has been written by former Vietnam war veteran Chuck Pfarrer. He also plays an important role in this film as a homeless tramp whose killing triggers a flurry of additional killing where evil plans of some corrupt rich denizens of New Orleans are revealed. Wild Target is a pure entertainer where free flow of adrenaline is clearly visible. Watching this film, one would feel as if a viewers is compelled to watch a high speed game of chess where moves have to be made quickly with great reflection. Wild Target would go down in history book as Hong Kong director John Woo's debut film. He doesn't disappoint as he has been successful in blending an existential theme with a contemporary topic whose relevance is of immense use to all of us.

She becomes concerned for his welfare when she discovers that he has stopped writing to her. Natasha files a missing persons report on her father, but finds that she hits a brick wall because her father was of no fixed abode. Due to a combination of being unfamiliar with the area and not knowing where to start looking for her father, Natasha decides to employ the services of out of work sailor Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who had rescued her earlier from a bunch of street punks. Chance agrees to help her, but initially the reason is only so that he can pay his debt to the boat company. However, the more that Chance and Natasha learn about her father's disappearance the more dangerous it becomes for both of them and they quickly find that there is more to his disappearance than a simple missing persons enquiry.This is another example of a film that you will enjoy more if you just switch off your brain and don't think about it. The story isn't entirely original and the narrative is unclear and messy - once you learn who they're pursuing, why they pursue them and the money involved to participate you may well end up scratching your head. Hard Target is also predictable and isn't as gritty or tense as the premise will have you believe. Having said all that if you take it as it is and don't think about the above things too much then there is enjoyment to be found here. That being said, where this film is at its best is in other technical areas; the martial arts scenes are well choreographed and very stylish, the direction is very crisp and for the most part the set pieces were great to watch (even though a lot of these set pieces were totally ridiculous). The film moves along at a brisk pace and I'll admit that I was never bored whilst watching this film.One thing this film is guilty of being is Cheesy - I'm unsure whether this is the effect that Woo was striving for, but come on!!! An early scene shows Van Damme appearing in the middle of the road (as if from nowhere complete with cheesy music). Then later he appears from behind a moving vehicle again with obligatory cheesy music. I was waiting for Clint Eastwood to appear in the next scene complete with poncho, cow boy hat and Cigar. It all sounds bad and it was, but I think that it was so bad that it was good - I found it to be funny/stupid rather than annoying/stupid.The acting was pretty shoddy (with the possible exception of Lance Henriksen). Wilford Brimley was pretty good fun as Chance's Uncle Douvee but sadly he wasn't given much screen time. Arnold Vosloo was OK as the Henchman, but he seemed to have an accent that came and went at will.All in all, it's not a bad film and as far as entertainment goes it's great, but the reason I've given it half marks is because the story is weak, unoriginal and predictable and the acting for the most part was laughable. Worth watching if you're an action/martial arts fan or a John Woo fan, but for anyone else you may want to look elsewhere .

It's a John Woo film. 2. It's got Jean-Claude Van Damme. 3. It's got Jean-Claude Van Damme teaming up with John Woo in his first ever American film. 4. John Woo's first ever American film is freaking awesome (though doesn't compare to his earlier work. Or Face/Off). 5. Van Damme punches a rattlesnake in the face. 6. As if the first five things weren't enough to get you interested, Lance Henriksen is the villain.A group of mercenaries (led by the fierce and intimidatingly likable Lance Henricksen) are hiring homeless 'Nam veterans to run across New Orleans to the river for $10,000. Only catch (which they learn once they're there on the spot) is that they will be chased by a client who hired the mercs to lure them in. The movie starts with one of these clients chasing across town and eventually killing a homeless man JUST as he reaches the river. We see this happen to another poor guy later on, which provides us with a good and thorough explanation of how these guys work they simply wave the money in these desperate men's faces and pressure them into hastily signing a contract, which ends with them not getting rich, but getting dead.If only they'd read the fine print. )Anyway, Natasha, the daughter of their first victim comes to town looking for her dad, and she recruits Chance (Van Damme) to help her out. Unfortunately, they learn the truth, and Lance and his buddy 'Imhotep' (no, Arnold Vosloo is not actually called that in this movie) start hunting Chance and Natasha across New Orleans with an army of goons.After hearing a lot of crap about John Woo's American films, with the exception of Face/Off, I was a little hesitant before checking this movie out. Especially since Van Damme is a hit-or-miss actor where he can be a riot to watch or a pain in the eyes (and ears). Here, he was pretty good, and so far this is my favourite Van Damme movie (though I admit I haven't seen more than three so far--it sure beats Timecop and Expendables 2). John Woo and Sam Raimi (whom I suspect had a firm hand in directing) bring us an ultra-violent, ultra-fun action movie with plenty of corny dialogue, cool stunts, loud and explosive gunfights, trademark Van Damme kicks, a memorable villain (seriously, Henricksen was AWESOME), and a minor semblance of a plot to hold it all together.It's outrageous and it's stupid and it's just too good to pass up.

We wonder why director John Woo is having them try to kill the man with arrows. The camera shows flying arrows in extreme close-up, which seems to be the reason. Arrows unrelated to these are used later in the film. Next, we see attractive and often very wide-eyed Yancy Butler (as Natasha Nat Binder) arrive in New Orleans. She is in town to search for her missing father. Demonstrating some Michigan naiveté, Ms. Butler allows local thugs to see she carries a substantial amount of cash. They decide to rob and (presumably) gang-rape her. Luckily, scraggly-haired handsome Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Chance Boudreaux) is around...After Mr. Van Damme uses his martial arts and muscles to beat up Butler's attackers, she hires him to help find her father. And, the plot thickens. Hard Target is a variation of the hunting adventure most familiar as The Most Dangerous Game (1924), written by Richard Connell. It provides Van Damme and director Woo with a good plot. Notably, screenplay writer Chuck Pfarrer also appears as the man being shot with arrows in the opening. One hair-raising highlight has Van Damme evading Henriksen and his henchmen on a motorcycle. The action picks up in a big warehouse full of pigeons and Mardi Gras paraphernalia. There is good support from Arnold Vosloo and others. The stunts are well staged and there is a refreshing lack of romantic interest.****** Hard Target (8/20/93) John Woo ~ Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lance Henriksen, Yancy Butler, Arnold Vosloo "},{"Title":"A Popcorn Entertaining Movie","Date":"8 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" For many who have seen Michael Bay films, and most of the action/comedies this film combines both of those things and you will be amazed.

The characters I can say are memorable but some things about the movie makes it weak which is why it got mixed reviews. Examples are like there are too many explosions happening that aren't even suppose to happen like in one scene Chance blows up a guy by pouring oil on him and then setting him on fire and he explodes, HOW! Unless he was holding dynamite or something. Also there are to many scenes focusing on the bad guys which are pretty scary because there is this henchmen who helps his boss kill people and in one part when one of there men are not following his orders the henchmen cuts of his ear, thank gosh it's off screen.My last thoughts on the movie it's not a great movie but it is a good one and it's kind of close to being popcorn entertainment cause there are many actions scenes that are awesome. I recommend this movie for people who likes action, adventure, and suspense. Another thing that makes this movie good is that,Super Mario makes an appearance I don't know what happen to his hat but it's also the first time Mario uses a weapon.

The film's plot is ridiculous and it gets over- violent to the point of being unpleasant, but it's all worth watching for Lance Henriksen's gleefully villainous show-off.

The story is tailored to feet the marketable features of the actor, and you have all the elements that surround this sub genre of action, which is action built around an action figure, in the Stallone tradition (but in this case with different moves). Also, i was never very fond of Woo's stylish approach. It's the style itself that bothers me, So, this would naturally be a time spender, a forgettable experience. Something you could watch on a well spent evening with a couple of already nostalgic 26 year old guys who grew up on this stuff.Now, my last comment was on a film i thought i'd hate, and that i actually enjoyed. This motivated a protest from a reader who's my friend and usually trusts my judgement, but based on that comment is starting loose his faith. I suspect i'll just make it worse with this comment, but i actually enjoyed some things in this film. Those positive things move around two things cinematography and sets.The first great thing is how we get into the film, the very first shots, a rainy night in a staged New Orleans, where a man is being hunted. The shots of the empty streets, from the pov of this man, these are great portals to the film. We have all the references in this first sequence New Orleans, the moody jazz, the Leone/Eastwood western environment (Vosloo character is even named Van Cleef!). These 3 elements meet Mad Max and the rules of that world, lawless, fertile ground for outlaws and maverick justice makers. We are transported into this world in the first few minutes, that's great, and i think we should credit Woo for how he conceived the entrance.Than of course, Van Damme gets in and this necessarily becomes closer to another of his typical films. Yet there are some very good uses of the city's streets, and 2 other sets that i'll take with me one is the house of Douvee, and its fragile robust look in the middle of the Louisiana. The other one is the final stage where the final fights occur. Now this last set is a fundamental piece for the success of this Good-Bad films. It usually is a well thought set, but not necessarily interesting. This one is, with all the props, all the colours, all the New Orleans mood transported into a film set. It's quite good.The action scenes themselves are boring and vulgar, even according with what was being done than.My opinion 4/5http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"Fast-paced enough for us to overlook its frequent absurdities","Date":"16 October 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Hard Target was the first American film directed by the Chinese director John Woo. The basic premise is that there exists a group of wealthy men who, tired of hunting animals, are prepared to pay up to $500,000 for the excitement of hunting and killing human beings. Their targets are selected from among the unemployed, homeless down-and-outs of New Orleans, normally former servicemen as their military training makes them harder targets to kill, thus affording greater sport to those pursuing them. (Hence the title of the film). Perhaps unusually for an action thriller, this one touches upon social issues in its clear concern for the plight of men who have served their country bravely but now find themselves rejected by society.The hero is Chance Boudreaux, an out of work Cajun merchant seaman who becomes involved with a young woman named Natasha Binder. Natasha is searching for her missing father, who it turns out was one of the men killed by the hunters.The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme (aka the Muscles from Brussels), who had followed another European former bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to Hollywood in the eighties. Neither man initially possessed any great acting talent, but by the early nineties Arnie had greatly improved his dramatic skills and he made some decent films, such as True Lies, during this period. Van Damme, however, showed no such improvement, and his performance in Hard Target is a characteristically wooden one. The Louisiana Cajun aspect to the film seems to have been deliberately contrived to allow Van Damme to play a character whose mother tongue is French, while keeping an American setting. (No American audience is going to want an action-adventure movie set in Paris or Brussels). The one thing in his favour is that, apart from Wilford Brimley's cameo as Chance's eccentric elderly uncle, the rest of the cast are no better, including his love interest Yancy Butler (aka the girl whose parents couldn't spell Nancy).The plot will not bear any too close inspection. We are asked to believe that the villains are not only ruthless but also ruthlessly efficient and well organised, able to conduct manhunts though the streets of a major city without anyone noticing. They also appear to have half the city's police and officials on their payroll and to have at their disposal enough firepower to wipe out a regiment. We are then asked to believe that, when confronted with what should be the fairly simple task of killing an unemployed drifter he proves to be more than a match for them and that when confronted by the hero they suddenly and miraculously lose their previously infallible ability to hit a moving target.And yet as an action thriller this is not a bad one. John Woo and other directors of a similar ilk are lucky that the action-adventure genre does not always require Olivier-calibre acting or coherent plots; if it did, most films of this type would be completely unwatchable. Woo gets the important things about this film right; the action sequences are well handled and the film is fast-paced enough for us to overlook its frequent absurdities. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Like most reviews I liked everything except Yancy Butler - who?","Date":"22 December 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" There are so many solid performances here - often from the peripheral actors who help make the dockside & street setting of much of the story believable.

Now this is the kind of movie you find late at night on TV, and many will go and watch it, it seems on the outside a good action thriller directed by a known director and starring an action legend. The only problem for me was, it isn't very good and that action legend isn't either.Jean-Claude Van Damme is that action legend and for me he is poor here, his character works in the story well though and if watched in the right way, his performance can be ignored. The plot as said is like a cat chasing a mouse, expect the mouse is a human in New Orleans and the cat or cats should I say are the very rich paying to chase them down. A unique take on an action movie but so unrefreshing that I can't give it credit for having uniqueness here.The director I mentioned is John Woo who's first ever American movie is actually well done, but only from him. With a poor script and acting and a plot that does hardly any favours, this is one movie where I feel kind of bad for Woo. He as I say does it nicely, he seems to know what he wants from the actors but they don't pay him back, the villains of the show are the real star actors with Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo being the best, not great for the bad guys to outshine the good.I'll give the film credit where it's due, and it deserves it in terms of the stunts and choreography it has, Van Damme does excel with his high leg kicks and powerful head smashes, but don't worry, the violence isn't too crazy for those who dislike it. The one thing that really again hurts this movie is the editing, the strange camera shots then coupled with edited shots of people, it makes the action scenes seem like some crazy movie that makes no sense, or maybe that's what it is possibly.Whatever your view on action films there is no denying this is not how to do them, Woo gives it a go as I said and does it well, but problems hamper this throughout. It's the kind of movie that I have come to expect though I mean there aren't many action thrillers similar to this that actually turn out good, even the best of them are usually only average. This I feel just needed a bit more heavy action, more fighting but with less insane death defying stunts that make this even more hard to believe. I think it is crucial John Woo is not remembered in years to come for films like this, and to be fair same with Van Damme, both can do much better.Overall I felt it is a bad movie as you might guess, but it isn't awful and not by quite a bit. It's a piece of film where you can watch it and not be too bothered by it, you won't finish with it and decide to smash things in anger about it, but you may just feel this should be more clinical. A big shout out to the man in my first paragraph Wilford Brimley, makes an appearance albeit for not too long but he is funny and his accent and jokes make the the movie kind of more fun than dark in his certain moments.

Although not his best, (it is one of his best) it was certainly a solid start. No better way make a great action film by having one of the hottest action stars in the world, Jean-Claude Van Damme. This was around the time that Van Damme's acting level was at par with other action stars such as Steven Seagal, but Van Damme was more versatile than him. Van Damme's role is a stereotypical tough-guy, drifter; greasy mullet, unshaven face, earring, long dark coat, ripped jeans. It is similar to Chuck Norris in The Hit-man a few years prior. Everybody praised the action and bashed nearly everything else. I'll admit, the story is weak a young woman (Butler) hires a homeless merchant (Van Damme) to help find her father, who was murdered by a group of thugs (lead by Henriksen and Vosloo) who hunt and kill drifters for sport. It is after they discover what happened to her father that the plot becomes stale. But that is just when the violence really starts to take off. And the violence presented in such an artful way that only John Woo can do. Because believe it or not, action can be done in an artful way. There is tons and tons of violence (actually one of the most violent movies I have ever seen) done in a fun and exciting fashion. With a 90's look and music incorporated, it is only natural that this would be one of the best action flicks of the decade.

But I dare you as a guy not to have fun with it","Date":"4 April 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Hard Target is such a blast of a midnight movie that I can almost forgive it for being at times, most times, so warped and awful. It's got some dialog that will have you ripping your hair out ala Dr. Scratch'n'sniff on Animaniacs and may have you doing a MST3K even if you're just watching it by yourself. It's a surprise that a major studio would let anyone direct a movie like this, but it's a credit then that not only John Woo had the back-up from his catalog of bad-ass Hong-Kong flicks but that he had the back-up of Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert to go on and just go totally bonkers with over-stylization. It's an American debut that just flips the bird and does what it wants, and for those looking for a completely tasteless action movie that sometimes makes no sense and at best it will make any guy remotely fans of action movies giddy as hell and occasionally slack-jawed.I should repeat it this is NOT a good movie. Some of the dialog is just so... it's hard to say it exactly, so here's a quote  If you understand me, just grunt. Actually, that's one of the better lines; just wait until villain Lance Henrikson is going completely bat-s*** in the last fifteen minutes of the movie and just spewing out whatever comes into his head! But hey, let's face it, if you come to John Woo's film of a Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle you're bound to just want to get blood, lots of it, and enough explosions and intentional dove shots to make even die-hard fans of the HK flicks go nuts. But even as it gets ridiculous, and there are some REAL moments like that (punching out a snake, synchronized explosions including the French uncle's own house, any given motorcycle stunt) it's never less than totally entertaining.Indeed, compared to a more serious effort like Windtalkers or something, John Woo is having a lot of fun as a filmmaker, finding new ways to explode and have his stunt and FX crew waste a perfectly good set to smithereens as his actors make out what is a totally bonkers live-action comic-book. Van Damme is about as bad-ass as possible throughout, whether doing an inane and illogical stunt or reciting his lines of dialog (Nat, like a bug?), and it shows signs of promise that he didn't live up to in the 90s. And there's even a small chunk of time, the sequence where the black veteran is being chased through the graveyard and through the New Orleans streets, that Woo gets a solid, non guilty pleasure scene that works totally on its terms.The rest of the time though, Hard Target is violent in such a way that has now become something of an over-used standard with super-ultra-mega violent productions; you can see its influence most directly recently in Wanted and in Snyder's direction in 300 and Watchmen (the latter quite out of place with the Woo touch). But at the same time Woo is already such a pro at his own way of doing a super-over-mega stylized action movie, loaded with cranes and dollies in the small scenes alone, that it's no wonder when we see the first slow-motion dove go across the screen Van Damme comments simply, Yeah. Hard Target is like taking three or four beer bongs in a row surrounded by hordes of drunken buddies and maybe some naked women - it's not something you would make a habit of, but you got to try it once, just once, depending on the frame of mind and age and excitement of the scene.

Chance & Natasha must be silenced so Fuchon sends everything he has after them...Three significant Hong Kong action director's first American films have starred Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ringo Lam made the average Maximum Risk (1996), Hark Tsui made the hilariously crap Double Team (1997) while John Woo's first US action flick was this, Hard Target. I'll say it right now I think Hard Target is a fantastic full-on 90's testosterone fuelled action film the likes of which they don't make anymore, there are two versions available the US 'R' rated cut & a 3 minute longer European cut which since I live in the UK will provide the basis of my comment (there is also a 116 minute director's cut & a 127 minute workprint version available but neither have ever been officially released & only exist as illegal bootlegs). The script by Chuck Pfarrer who plays Douglas during the opening sequence takes itself pretty seriously & is an overblown fast moving ultra violent action filled piece of nonsense that is a fabulous way to spend 100 odd minutes, I must admit I also liked the lack of cheesy one-liners & quips which were popular in action films around this time. The basic story is alright but hardly anything original as one could say it's a modern retelling of The Most Dangerous Game (1932) but there's nothing wrong in that & there are some super action scenes, JCVD doesn't get much dialogue, the character's are pretty good & it moves along like a rocket. It's not perfect as it's as far fetched as a lot of these 90's action films are with death & gravity defying stunt work that you just can't take seriously but what the hell Hard Target is one hell of a ride with bags of unnecessarily gratuitous violence (the best kind!), explosions, vehicular mayhem, shoot-outs, glamorous weaponry & JCVD killing endless amounts of bad guys, what more do you want?Director Woo has had to tone things down a bit here but some of his trademark style still survived, the obvious inclusion is the slow-motion doves & birds along with JVCD blowing people away with a gun in each hand & reflections of bad guy's in glass. The action is well staged although the motorbike bit is silly as JCVD drives a bike into a jeep & then jumps over the top of the jeep & lands behind it all in slow motion, I don't know how they did it because it obviously wasn't CGI but it does stretch the credibility a bit. Most of the violence & gore is just the sheer amount of times people get shoot but someone has half their ear sliced off with scissors, a rattle snake has it's head blown off & there are some martial arts fights as JCVD kicks butt.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 (apparently JCVD was paid $3,000,000) Hard Target is well made & has high production values, the action scenes, fights & stunts are impressive although Graeme Revell puts in another bland action film score. The acting is alright, JCVD does OK but thankfully he doesn't get much dialogue & I'm not sure about that hair-do either, Butler makes for a suitably attractive female companion while I rather fancied Kasi Lemmons who played Detective Mitchell & thought she was unfairly killed off, the always excellent Lance Henriksen makes for an intense & memorable villain.Hard Target is a a classic 90's action flick & probably JCVD's best along with Sudden Death (1995), so that's it really if you like over-the-top ultra violent actions films with a touch of style & a cool villain then Hard Target could just be what your looking for.

All his trademarks are there. For instance the over-use of slow motion, the love of bad guys on motorbikes and of course the worst of them all the white doves! I once heard the explanation that John Woo liked the white doves because they were a symbol of peace, strangely put from a man who makes movies with higher bodycounts than most.The story here is your standard-fare b-action. Van Damme is the benevolent stranger who helps a young woman search for her lost father. First he does it for money, then (of course) he does it for her and their survival. So, what raises this above the bar when it comes to action films?Well, first of all the movie looks better than most of Van Dammes other films put together (despite his terrible hair-style). If there is something John Woo does know, it's how to direct action scenes that look great. And Van Damme is in good form beating, kicking, shooting and maiming people left and right. Also Lance Henriksen and Arnold The Mummy Vosloo are very entertaining in an over-the-top way as the bad guys.So, despite it's flaws Hard Target is an entertaining ride. I would definitely rate it as Van Dammes best performance so far, and the way things are going for him now it's likely this is the best performance he will ever have a chance to make. I rate this 6/10 for effort, style and a pace that never makes it boring or slow. Also Van Dammes emotional moment of explaining how hard it is to live on the street is an entertainment gem.

They were all masterpieces, with an emotional or sentimental tale with realistic characters, interspersed with amazing action set-pieces with slow-motion gunplay, double-gun action and ballet style choreography, with hidden messages of peace drilled into the conflict.However, Woo was given a contract to make the move to mainstream Hollywood movies - being the first Asian director to have that opportunity.  Naturally, Woo grabbed the oppurtunity and made this, his debut Hollywood film.But the conversion isn't brilliant.  Sure, 'Hard Target' maintains Woo's jaw-dropping action, and it still has all his trademarks, but it drops in the character department.  All of the characters are almost emotionless, maybe due to the overall bad acting.  Jean Claude Van Damme, as usual, is wooden but impresses in the action scenes.

The Killer, Hard Boiled, A better tomorrow 1 and 2 are just four of the twenty-two films he had directed in his homeland. Now America wanted him and what America wants, America gets.

They wanted Mr Woo's high impact style but they drew a line in the sand and this was something Mr Woo had never encountered before.

But during the course of their investigation they discover a game of death in which rich folks hunt the homeless.Apparently Woo wanted Kurt Russell in the lead, but with Van Damme's sub-par skills draining fun from the film the best performances come from the always brilliant Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo as the main villain and right-hand man. Mr. Woo's gunfighting and action SHOULD also make the film more enjoyable, though compared to his original vision, a 116-minute epic, the final cut is butchered 97-minute could-have-been.

Aside from the Garbage Picking, Field Goal Kicking, Philladelphia Phenomenon, it is the only movie to sweep the Oscars. JCVD won his record setting 4th Best Actor Oscar, the movie was also the eigth Van Damme film to win Best Picture (another record).When discussing a motion picture of this merit, it is difficult to deconstruct both the cultural messages and themes that the text addresses. Feminist critics have criticized the movie for its portrayal of women. The film, they assert, presents a view of women that seems to imply that they are weak and in need of assistance from Alpha Males, such as JCVD. While their assertion is correct, that very portrayal is highly accurate. It has now been established as scientific fact that women are meek and unable to perform the most menial tasks, aside from meal preparing, fetching me a beer, and sexing me up. Therefore, the film's assertion, while annoying to feminist critics, is correct and, therefore, inherently insightful.I don't really feel like talking about the movie or its themes anymore, but I will say this JCVD is the greatest actor of all time. His character in this movie sets a new standard for Hollywood Hunks. At one point, he grabs a flaming board (possible homosexual imagery). At another point, he does this tough thing with his leg and alluding to packing heat. He also surfs on a motorcycle. Van Damme is clearly an actor able to choose his roles, and write a great story. His roles are constantly new and unique, and destroy the viewer's standard perception of what an action movie is or isn't.I would like to take this opportunity to speak about an issue that affects us all. President George W. Bush is a fool. He rarely, if ever, has any sort of idea what he is talking about. The man, along with his Christian Coalition cohorts, is hijacking our country. It is unbelievable that he got reelected. What we need is new leadership in the form of Fidel Castro. Fidel has created a communist paradise on the island of Cuba. That's right, I'm anti-Bush and pro-Castro. At the very least, we could help the USSR regain its formal glory. The Soviet Block changed the face of the world, primarily for the better. As I understand it, as long as I don't swear, I can talk about Castro as much as I want, so I will. Castro has been leading America for years now. And that is why he is evil. It's like 1984, dudes. Castro is having us believe that America is the enemy, as is Cuba. It's absurd. The workers of the world must unite and bring down Castro. Bush will lead our new America, and prepare the world for a new world order.Congo is also a pretty good movie. My friend Kevin wrote a review of that movie that is insightful and witty. It is the romantic comedy of the year. The movie stars Ben Afleck and Matt Damon as two star crossed lovers. Their familes, however, have been rivals for years. After Romeo kills Tybalt, he is banished and he and Juliet end up both dying for us all. After Jesus was crucified Andy was born.

It is a testament to how big Jean Claude Van Damme really was in the early nineties. He was a master of the action/Martial Arts film. Nearly every scene in this film feels like a spoof...a joke and yet its not at all. I am actually surprised Van Damme would do something like this given his ego because couldn't he see just how ridiculous it was. Its like the ultimate spoof of the 80's action genre. Who better to do it than John Woo? I constantly hear how legendary this director is but I often wonder if this opinion too is a joke. The guy almost killed the Mission Impossible franchise with ridiculous hair, constant slow motion camera tricks, and ridiculous hero analogies. And here we have Hard Target with the exact same MO. Hair, slow-mo, hero analogies all over again. Some day I might have someone watch this film and tell me how many times he goes into slow motion which is not dramatic in this case or even remotely cool but instead looks ridiculous, hokey and dumb. Especially when your hero is sporting a greasy, stringy mullet. Now all this being said, I'll be darned if this isn't some sort of bizarre cheeky entertainment. Maybe because its laughable or just how incredibly outlandish the action scenes are. The scene with Van Damme standing on the seat of a dirt bike, shooting bad guys and then rolling over the top of their car...is just too ridiculously legendary to not be cool. This is the stuff Chuck Norris wishes he had under his belt.Jean Claude Van Damme is not a great actor, never was. But there is no arguing his chemistry in the 90's. There is just something slick and cool about that enormous ego that he has. His character in Hard Target is just about portrayed as God-like. He has this untouchable, swoon at his feet persona that it so ridiculous that its fun to watch. Yancy Butler is the stereotypical required female partner to Van Damme. She does alright and certainly has the deer in the headlights look down pat. She literally looks 90% of the time like she is on an infomercial that is selling Jean Claude Van Damme and she wants it! Her longing looks and open mouthed gaping is hilarious. Their chemistry is okay but really sort of unnecessary. Lance Henriksen is actually the perfect action hero villain. He has the look down and he a cold blooded horrifying killer. He probably has the best role in the entire film. He is a very worthy action film villain. Not to be outdone Arnold Vosloo is a brilliant right hand man to Henriksen. He could have easily been the lead villain in his own right. He is equally as cold and calculating and you get two great final battles when Van Damme takes them on. Wilford Brimley makes a cameo as the obligatory old man that the hero cares about.John Woo gets constant praise from fans for being a brilliant action director but his style is always the same and is so awkward at times. He has to be the king of overusing slow motion and when you pair it together with Van Damme and this story it just makes it even more cheesy. Now all this being said Hard Target has found its niche. Twenty years later and it can sit comfortably in action classic status. You can laugh at it and marvel at the action scenes. Plenty of explosions and gun fights and non-stop action especially towards the end of the movie. I can give them kudos for actually creating a solid story even if its a little cookie cutter and predictable. Ultimately Hard Target is nothing but sheer entertainment no matter how you take it or look at it. Nothing wrong with that but it certainly makes a lot of grievous errors in film making and they should just be lucky that it will likely continue to achieve cult status amongst action fans and Van Damme junkies. 7/10 "},{"Title":"A lot going for it *personal top 100*","Date":"31 March 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" ... but Claude Van Damme is not it! Not a fan, here, of a guy who has more wood in him than the Bastoin forest. Maybe I'm just not a karate fan it always seems to me that by the time you've finishing spinning and getting your leg up, any adversary could have laid you out, end of. The slow-motion sequences just make me want to give the guy a Coors Light, so he can take his pay check and get out of there. Seagal is a much more engaging actor for me, and his Aikido seems more credible. However, I find this movie an enjoyable ride!Firstly, the premise is powerful and interesting. Sick gun-loving sons- of-bitches run a business which stages real-life hunts of some poor wretch who 'will not be missed'. They always take care to choose somebody with a fighting background, like a Nam Vet, just to give them a bit of a challenge. The script makes an effort to lend this credibility by explaining that 'trouble spots' in the world are always chosen for this, and they move on from country to country after each 'hunt' to evade fallout.Secondly, some of the characters are extremely strong, particularly the villains. Lance Henriksen is always good value, and here puts in a wonderfully hard-assed and droll portrayal of the 'Director' (for want of a better title).Legendary movie quote #33 Now you know why we insist on payment up front. LOLHis side-kick, 'Pik', is a superbly sadistic piece of work by Arnold Vosloo. He doesn't overplay it, yet leaves the viewer in no doubt as to his nature. He has a quiet and chilling business-like manner most of the time, but when time comes for an execution you see what a hobby it is for him, with the twinkle in his eye. The two lead females are sympathetic and credible characters, especially policewoman Kasi Lemmons.Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the 'lovable' but ridiculous Uncle Douvee. I guess he was injected into the final phase of the movie to lend a sprinkling of humour, but imo it did not need it. We already have the two main good characters to engage with, and the movie should have been allowed to stand on its gritty and punchy violence and the quite disturbing aspects of human nature. We really care if some of these characters live or die, even the psychos! In a downtown New Orleans scene, one of the 'hunted' is totally unable to get anybody to help him, which made me really angry. All too believable, and really lent credibility to how the company gets away with it.Uncle Douvee... jeez. If you can get past the image of this old fool playing the hero, then fair play to you (maybe I need to 'lighten up'). If you can get past the attempts at a French (or Belgian, whatever) accent by the very American bit-part actor Wilfred Brimley, then you were not getitng properly into the movie in the first place. Sorry to pick on him, but for me it really grated. It's all the more sad when you remember him in his straight-up role as a mafia henchman in 'The Firm' believable and exactly the tone called for here.Bit-part is what it was, though, and the strengths of the movie outweigh the weaknesses. I would have loved to see Harrison Ford or even Bruce Willis in the Van Damme role - with the every-guy credibility and minus the slow motion, please!

This movie was an interesting piece that definitely had potential and does keep a person in anticipation.  After the first watch, however, you find the movie becomes a bit lackluster.  It seems there are certain movie writers & makers that won't expand a movie line or rewrite it to allow a more thought through plot and storyline.  To cover Van Damme's french accent, they incorporated into the script a cajun background and try to allow an american action hero to emerge.  While that makes sense, the story tends to slow at that point and a cheap quick action sequence immediately follows.  No foreshadow required there.  Going back to where the movie had potential, we see homeless military veterans being used in a sport hunt, where they get a large sum of money if they win, in which a corrupt group of individuals get their kicks murdering, regardless if the veteran really wins.  This offers the development of a hero who emerges among them, but has done some detective work on the situation and has a different thought in mind than running away with the cash.  My thought is a different actor should have been cast, or rewrite the script as this taking place in another country.  I don't agree with others that this was a total flop as this brought in a new way of viewing a domestic villain vs. domestic hero, yet again, writers need to break out of the mold and realize not all plots can be condensed in 90 minutes or less.This movie is definitely worth renting once or twice, but add to your collection if you're either a Van Damme fan or you like the hard to find action movies.

The only differences lie in construction, cast, and execution.Hard Target sits in the middle of his films on my ranking, right below The Killer, Face/Off, and Bullet in the Head because it has a very dominant visual impression.  In some respects, this is leagues beyond what Woo did in Hard-Boiled...even the casting is better.  Broken Arrow was stagnant, Hard-Boiled was nihilistic overkill, and A Better Tomorrow was rotten pulp.  They all have the same style but some go more overboard than others.Double guns, doves, hospitals, throw gun, diving, male camaraderie, leading lady in distress, honor codes, heartless villains, all of these elements make up the Woo method.  They are implemented in scripts by ignoring intelligent plot development in exchange for throwing in another action scene.  The Matrix suffers from this disease, so do the Terminator movies.  Die Hard doesn't have this problem because the advancements are logical and don't come too quickly.Story means nothing in Woo's movies, even The Killer is a messy, cliche plot.  It's his cinematography and choreography that set him apart from such hacks as Michael Bay, Walter Hill, Jan deBont, and John McTiernan.  In many cases you can see where Sam Raimi liberally borrows from Woo's style and vice-versa.  Compare Hard Target to Army of Darkness and you'll see many obvious and subtle comparisons.This is Van-Damme's best movie and that statement means absolutely nothing.  The man is a prop like the hundreds of other weapons that populate Woo movies.  Lance Henriksen, who has fallen to this level of film either because he doesn't adapt many methods or because his agent is terrible, creates a rather dull character.  The script doesn't do many justices to any actor, it's just a set-up.  Using Nicolas Cage hasn't been a wise move on Woo's part, Tom Cruise was even worse.Overall, Hard-Target emphasizes the better elements of Woo's method and uses fewer of his weaker ones.  It is a dumb film, but highlights his self-referential style.  However, being an action director is lowest-common-denominator territory.  Why hasn't Renny Harlin made a version of The Usual Suspects?  2.5 out of 5 stars.

One of the world's best directors of action actually directs some action! All of a sudden Hard Target turns into something very special indeed, with some of the best set-pieces I have seen in a film of its type. The plot takes a walk and everything explodes. Jean-Claude Van Damme is not the best of actors but he has something approaching presence when he's beating people up. The action here is so ridiculous it's untrue. At one point Van Damme stands on top of a moving motorbike and...well, I'm not going to ruin it, but it's pretty good stuff. What was so bad it was just bad in the film's first hour becomes so bad it's now funny. Woo has a tendency to show everything in slow motion. I'm talking everything, even stuff that doesn't matter. Why? It looks terribly self-indulgent but ends up being all the more entertaining. Van Damme sports a horrible mullet that blows gently in the wind in slow motion during any silly profile shots. Lance Henriksen's bad guy is so incompetent (ignoring the good advice of his henchman to quit while he's ahead), especially in the film's big finale, that he becomes good value to watch. The scene when a snake is punched out is genuinely hilarious.Woo, however, does stage violence purely for violence's sake. In one scene, Van Damme's Chance Boudreaux (stupid name) shoots a guy twelve or so times, and for no real reason, does a flying kick and boots the cigar out of his mouth, just so that Woo can capture another smart looking slo-mo shot. The same goes for one bit when Chance kicks another guy in his face, making his cheeks go, well, funny looking. Just watch it, it's really surreal. The final twenty minutes are a peach, with non-stop death and even more slow motion, though also with huge lapses in logic. My advice on this film is to avoid the first two-thirds, then sit back and enjoy the excellent final forty minutes. Finally, Van Damme cannot act, though everyone knows that.

Wow, what is there to say about this movie, it certainly was released in 1993, 1993 was a great year for Alternative rock, not that this movie has any Pavement songs or Dinosaur Jr. or Nirvana songs, stuff gets blown up though, a sh*tload of stuff like homes and vehicles and in several instances even people get blown up. That's quality film making!

I haven't seen many of his extensive list of Chinese films, except for Hard Boiled, which I found less than impressive, like the spectacularly disappointing Windtalkers. Hard Target is his first effort in Hollywood, until the far superior Broken Arrow and Face/Off. The movie bears striking resemblance to Surviving the Game, although can't be accused of stealing the idea, since that movie came out the following year.Sadly, this movie plays like a lot of bizarre action movie experiments strung along a thin and uninteresting plot. There is some goofy and distracting slow motion used during the fights, which had a strange charm in Kickboxer but just look odd here.The story is mainly about a couple guys who provide an opportunity for wealthy people to hunt and kill someone, for a cool $500,000. It has always been the privilege of the few to hunt the many, the villain explains, although the movie goes on to show that the few, to the contrary, hunt the few. That is until Van Damme's perfectly named character, Chance, becomes the hunted, in which case it is the many hunting the one. And not doing such a bang-up job of it, either (It appears your trophy is ripping us a new orifice!).The setting is New Orleans, which for some reason seems to be totally deserted (except for a single scene that I can think of at the moment), giving the movie a cheap soundstage feel, and features a paper thin movie villain who's only bit of personality comes from his sidekick. I can't remember his name so I'll just call him Imhotep.Huge amounts of money are mentioned throughout the film, I suppose to remind us that we are dealing with people who think nothing of $500,000 or $750,000, but when you toss in numbers that big it just starts to feel fake and contrived, like in Sudden Death, where the bad guy wanted to steal something like $2,000,000,000. Why not $20 billion? Or how about a bazillion? That would be exciting.As I said, the plot is unimportant. Ultimately we get a situation where Chance is being pursued by the bad guys, although this time not some rich lunatic who wants to feel the power of killing another man, but by about 20 guys who get in on the hunt for $750,000 each. I can't remember if they were charged that much or paid that much, but it's telling that it really doesn't matter, neither situation would work. Why would anyone pay that much money to kill someone? And even if they would, where does Fouchon (Henriksen) find these guys? And there were more than 20 of them, so if he's paying them, why would he blow more than $15,000,000 just to kill one guy? Clearly there is not a lot of thought put into this screenplay&#133; Anyway, we get a lot of action clichés, which sadly seem to be something that John Woo is really good at. I especially love the scene where Chance punches a rattlesnake in the head and then bites off its rattle, so that the bad guys chasing him won't hear it rattle just before it attacks them. Truly bizarre, but unique, to be sure. There is also a scene where Chance kicks a gas can (that is clearly almost completely empty) at a bad guy, and then he shoots it and it explodes like it was full of nitro-glycerine. Hey, maybe it was.Ultimately, the movie culminates in the same shootout we've seen 1000 times, except that this time it's not just an old warehouse, but an old warehouse full of what appear to be parade floats. I hadn't seen that in a movie before. It's a unique set, to be sure, but if nothing else, the cartoonish villain (a criminally misused Lance Henriksen) ruins it when he loses his temper and starts firing pot shots at the floats, which explode like fireworks. Then there is the matter of the anonymous motorcyclist bad guys, who are dressed from head to toe in black and literally pop up exactly like pop-up targets to be easily picked off one by one, just like the bad guys did in Windtalkers.John Woo always overdoes his gunfights, and here is no exception. Every bad guy literally gets shot 10 or 12 times (except for Fouchon, who gets shot about twice as many times), but at least Chance remembers to reload, pulling one clip after another out of the back pocket of those skin tight jeans.If nothing else, at least the movie provides a brief educational lesson about military hardware near the end. You may not have known this before, but evidently you can just untwist a live grenade like a soda bottle to diffuse it. Imagine if that knowledge fell into the wrong hands! The movie ends with a Creedence Clearwater Revival song that has appropriate lyrics for the movie but is otherwise totally out of the blue and musically just doesn't fit. The rest of the soundtrack seems to have been inspired by Van Damme's hair, which is probably the most memorable thing about the movie.In his first American action effort, John Woo swings&#133;and misses...

No, Hard Target is as routine as it gets for a Van Damme flick...Directed by the inimitable John Woo, Hard Target once again sees JCVD (Jean Claude) up against a host of bad guys who have taken a remarkable dislike to him. Nancy Butler, whoever she is, plays the token chick caught up in the shebang. I'm not sure if Jackie Chan films stole this format, or if it was the other way around, but suffice to say everyone gets in bother and JCVD, as per usual does 'an Arnie' and kills everyone and saves the day. We *know* this is how JCVD films work so this isn't exactly a spoiler - no, the excitement is seeing how he does it...sort of. Lots of martial arts, lots of guns, and lots of imaginative ways of killing people. It's pretty well directed by the debutant Woo, who went onto much better things, namely the excellent Face Off, and the not so better MI2. Plenty of action and loud explosions are his forte, and he certainly starts out here as he means to continue.In terms of acting it's pretty appalling, with the vast majority of 'actors' really struggling to put 2 coherent words together. The exceptions to this are the always classy Lance Henrikson as the main Big Boss Bad Guy (tm), and the surprisingly effective Arnold Vosloo as Van Cleef, his bodyguard/business partner type.Overall, it's Van Damme. We know what we get here.

The blood flew pretty close to what it probably does in real life, all actions had consequences, and nearly no one was a cardboard cutout. For years, I've been listening to folk grouse about Hard Target being a misfire, a mistake, or just simply not worthy of what came before (one of the most irritating examples they love to throw up is Hard Boiled, a good, solid HK movie, but not up to the hype too many folks have given it). Curiousity finally got the better of me and I decided about four months ago to see for myself. What I came away with was the belief that this is a doughnut film, weak to non-existent center surrounded by strong elements all around (the original Under Siege is a similar such film).But, before I go into the single biggest defect in this film, let's start with what the film got right. Chuck Pfarrar's script isn't too original (going back to that short story classic, The Most Dangerous Game, in concept), but it carries the premise solidly and believably enough. The real New Orleans is a city of complicated and crooked political crosscurrents, which, with its surrounding bayous, makes it the ideal manhunting ground. Woo's direction captures the sense of the place very well, making it as much a character in the story as the human players (one could argue that he did the same for Hong Kong in his earlier films). Genre veteran Lance Hendrickson brings his patented smoky, suave menace to bear on the twisted game warden who's been organizing and making a killing, so to speak, off his inhuman enterprise. Not that he's without human qualities (his piano playing sequence and small smile of admiration for Roper's decision to take it from the front are the best examples), but definitely not a guy one invites to dinner. Arnold Vosloo, as his sociopathic second-in-command, Van Cleef, seems to relish the role, playing him as a svelte animal whose only joy in life comes from inflicting death, the messier the better. Future Witchblade Yancy Butler is a little too believably naive and helpless as the woman looking for her father and later his killers. That said, she does redeem herself with one memorable event towards the end that brings to mind a similar scene in Hard Boiled. Finally, Wilford Brimley is a treat as the old Cajun moonshiner out to help his nephew at any cost. You gotta respect a guy who's willing to blow his own place up just to get the bad guys.Perceptive readers may have already guessed where I've been going with this, but I'll say it anyway. The single biggest flaw in this film is its star, Jean-Claude Van Damme You All. This could have been the best film of his career...if he actually had any acting talent to begin with. It's a meaty role, a Cajun merchant marine who did time in the Marine Recon and now needs the cash of finding Butler's dad to get back to work. As written, he's tough, he's clever, he's likable. As played by Van Damme...well, let's just say that Woo did not get the Belgian equivalent of Chow Yun Fat. His accent, for once, isn't a problem, but his line readings are. He could have been reading a prescription bottle for all the emotion he put into them. Plus, he never manages to convince me that he's actually smart enough to come up with any of the very clever ways of offing the hunters that come into play. It makes his reported clashs with Woo over the film look even more petty than they already are (Woo probably found the MPAA more reasonable, by contrast). In short, he is the hole in the doughnut for this film.It's really kind of sad that, but for one major flaw, this film could have become a classic of the action genre. Sadly, as things stand, it can only be called a missed opportunity.

As a result his career took a nosedive (forgettable films like Sudden Death, Timecop, and Knock Off).The action scenes were long, overdone and comical, the motorcycles on the bridge were just too much for me.  The hand-to-hand combat was edited down for censors; the fact that the fightscenes looked so violent, yet we don't see it. and the most obvious fact...urban thugs with guns, money and trucks can just rampage through a major US city, after another urban drifter.The story is basically about, Yancy Bulter searching for her deadbeat (and homeless) father in the Touristless New Orleans French quarter, and enlists the guideship of a Cajun drifter with a mullet and trenchcoat(Van Damme).It seems the NOPD is on Strike, so crime is raging.  A tough richboy (Lance Henriksen, in a memorable role), along with his guntoting sidekick (Arnold Vosloo with hair) and their goons participate in a sport of hunting down unsuspecting victims after chasing them up and down the streets.After a series of explosions, car chases and trainjumpings, VD and Butler are now the new hard targets.  But why?I saw this movie when i was 14 (way back in 1993), i was dissappointed then, the only scene I vividly remember was the rabid rattlesnake (and quite fake looking) on steroids.  I recently saw it again on tv, and I remembered why I disliked it.  John Woo tried so hard to give this what would otherwise be a high-octane bloodfest some heart and sole, but instead he gives it a mishmash of overacting, too many explosions, and not enough good guys to balance the bad.On a positive note, I did like the little scene where Van D. sees all the innocent people die deaths that were not supposed to happen.A good movie for TBS, but nothing more.

Or maybe blame should be placed on the screen writers who didn't write a fully charged action film that knew it was an action film (a la Face/Off).  Personally I blame the choosing of Van Damme to play the hero - he doesn't suit the wandering, long-coat wearing, lone-wolf hero that he plays in this film - he suits the action hero (a la Sudden Death). The film also moves at a snail's pace, and doesn't go anywhere until the end, where in typical Woo fashion, everything blows up for no reason. For example, there is one scene that has me in hysterics - Van Damme is riding a horse, and there is a guy in a chopper shooting at him as he rides through the forest - now the guy is a professional, and yet can't shoot the guy - not only that, as the bullets bounce off the ground, they turn into sub-explosions for no reason!Anyway, some people may enjoy this, but I certainly didn't.  Perhaps the martial art scene's could have been more involving and perhaps if I really cared about Van Damme's dull and tedious character I might be more engaged about this film - but I'm not.  Instead I felt bored and unsatisified throughout.Overall 2/10.

So, oh well, I took it and payed.And, well... It's not a bad movie. It is very clear from the beginning that this is a movie by Woo. But it's not a good movie either. The main reason is that Woo really needed a better plot and screenplay to follow. The actionscenes are (not surprising) amazing. The first one is cool enough to give the entire movie a ten. And the (to say the least) powerful ending is just incredible. The directing and editing is then high class. But the rest of the movie is not as great. Acting almost overall sucks. Van Damme is not as ultra-bad as usual, but to say that he's good is a big overtone. The rest of the acting is uninteresting and bad. The rescue is then Lance Henriksen. Even though he's going auto-pilot with this bad guy-role he's hilarious. What HARD TARGET needs, except from better acting, is a script. The plot hardly change, and the screenplay is just too boring, it's as simple as that. And the fact that the acting isn't good, makes you care very little that the girl's father is murdered. The first hour is way too slow to be a movie by John Woo. Nothing happens. All that happens is that they always come too late to the murders and that they find out what the audience have known all along... You're father is dead, honey.

With Van Damme as the star, I guess they wanted to do more hand to hand combat instead of the gunplay that Woo is famous for.  Well the movie suffers for it.  Wilford Brimley doesn't help things either.  At least Woo had a reason for making this movie, as it got him known by American audiences.  This one doesn't approach Woo's earlier works like Hard Boiled or The Killer, and neither is it up to par with his later American movies. Only see it if you are a die hard Woo or Van Damme fan.  4 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Oh-well..","Date":"15 April 2000","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  Van Damme movies are for the sometime acquired taste...(for me it varies like eating a holiday meal from a cafeteria..?)I saw this one for two reason's 1.

Unfortunately, Chuck Pfarrer's shallow script jettisons the heartfelt melodrama of Woo's Hong Kong output (BULLET IN THE HEAD, HARD-BOILED, etc.) and concentrates instead on action for its own sake, demonstrating a singular lack of trust in Woo's ability to court American sensibilities. The director's visual style remains largely intact, however, including his obsessive fascination with weaponry and gunfire, while Van Damme replaces Chow Yun-fat as Woo's stateside hero of choice (the action star is rendered exquisitely beautiful by Russell Carpenter's worshipful camera).Needless to say, the action scenes are choreographed with grace and conviction (Van Damme never punches an opponent when a flying kick will do the job just as well!), and Henriksen makes a formidable villain (performing his own fire stunt in one of the film's most breathtaking sequences). But the scenario rings entirely hollow, despite fine production values and a capable cast, including heroine Yancy Butler, boo-hiss henchman Arnold Vosloo, and Eliott Keener (BORN WILD) as a sleazy porn merchant who suffers for his association with Henriksen. Look out for the witty visual homages to both LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) and OPERA (1987), demonstrating Woo's mastery of the visual medium and his appreciation of movie history.

The director shoving the most insulting stunts down our throats, that reminds me a movie he would later come to direct.  Um, let's see. . was it Mission Impossible 2?There is one similarity that is absolutely hilarious!  Both of these movies contains laughable motorcycle stunts.  MI2, Tom Cruise dragging both feet next to the bike before leaping 20 feet into a mid-air collision.  Yeah, right.  Hard Target, we get treated to Van Damme STANDING UP on the seat of the bike (which by itself is stupid enough) but then the bike continues to go perfectly straight, AND he shoots the bad guys with perfect aim. Now, I don't know how stupid they think the general public is. . .but apparently it's enough, that he would reprise the bike stunts for MI2.  I guess he didn't get the memo, the first time.

Has anyone ever noticed how any two randomly picked Van Damme/Steven Seagal films are indistinguishable ?? Small American town, check. Powerful scumbag villain who terrorizes over the whole town with his pack of goons, check. Inept cops, check. Tough guy who is indestructible & wont bow down before anybody, check. Standard issue damsel-in-distress/sex-machine with blue eyes & long hair, check. Guns, knives, martial arts, slow-motion, chases on foot, chases with dogs pursuing, chases in gas-guzzling SUVs', explosions, ALL check. This has all become boilerplate B-movie material since Patrick Swayze's 'Road House'.This film still actually has a fan following, which is beyond belief. Dwayne The Rock Johnson also made a movie obeying the exact same template. I think it was called 'Walking Tall' or something like that. This film also stars Lance Henriksen as the villain, who stares into a mirror while playing a piano. Henriksen didn't get one decent role after Aliens, which is a pity. An interesting fact is that the Governator has not EVER made a film following the above template, which is quite an achievement.I've again begun watching 2-3 bad films a day. Exams have really begun.

More than enough space and time, for that type of snakes to sunk his teeth into your arm or hand. Rattlers and Puffadders are extremely strong type of snakes and very quick. I've heard of a man standing with his bike on one and the snake pulled himself out underneath the tyre. They also have a strange way of biting with a reverse angle. I've seen it with my own eyes how they can pull them self out of a mans fist and start biting left, right and center. So if he thinks he will get away holding a snake like that... Good luck to him. Because he wont... I just don't want to be around when he is playing with snakes. Especially Rattlers.

The scene is set in French-ish New Orleans to cover up Jean-Claude's silly Belgian accent. But let me reveal that the producers don't fool anyone It is easily spotted that monsieur Damme's accent is caused by lack of acting talent. So goes for the rest of the cast, especially miss one-face-expression Yancy Butler, who plays the movies  annoyingly heroine. The only ones having a good day are the pyrotechnicians and the stuntmen who are nicely choreographed by John Woo in the films end sequence.
