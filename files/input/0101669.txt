[{"Title":"Classy Modern Noir Fantasy","Date":"18 April 2005","Score":"62 out of 69 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Although he received tremendous praise for his memorable film production of Shakespeare's HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN was the film that really introduced actor/director Kenneth Branagh to mainstream American film, and for a time he and then-wife Emma Thompson were the most celebrated acting couple since Olivier and Leigh. The marriage did not last, but fortunately this film did--and I say fortunately, for although it is somewhat forgotten today, DEAD AGAIN is an overlooked jewel of a film classy, noir-ish, stylish, and very memorable indeed.The story is fanciful. In the late 1940s noted composer Roman Strauss was convicted of murdering his noted pianist wife Margaret, and was sentenced to death. Some forty years later, a young woman suffering from amnesia falls into the hands of a no-nonsense Los Angeles private eye--and under hypnosis she recalls not her immediate past, but the lives of Roman and Margaret. Is this reincarnation? Is she Margaret Strauss? Is the private eye to whom she is attracted but of whom she is also strangely fearful the reincarnation of Roman Strauss, Margaret's killer? Is history repeating itself? Scott Frank's clever script makes for a fast-paced, twisting, and fascinating plot-driven film--and it is flawlessly played by Branagh and Thompson, who assume dual roles as the 1940s Roman and Margaret Strauss and the 1980s Mike Church and Grace. The supporting cast is also excellent, with memorable performances by Andy Garcia and Derek Jacobi--and a truly exceptional cameo by Robin Williams, who here for the first time demonstrated that his talents went far beyond comedy. The shifts between past and present, nightmare and reality are exceedingly well done, and although the plot becomes more and more fantastic the entire film is so perfectly executed that one buys into it every step of the way.If DEAD AGAIN has a flaw, it is that some of the twists and turns are predictable--but in the film's favor I must admit that it sweeps you along so quickly that you seldom have time to analyze that failing while you actually watch the film. It is also to a certain extent a one trick pony film; the film is at its most powerful upon a first viewing, when one is oblivious to what is coming. But even so, it is tremendously effective and it holds up as well today as when it first appeared on the big screen. The current DVD includes little in the way of extras beyond commentary tracks by producer Lindsay Doran, writer Scott Frank, and director-star Kenneth Branagh--and these are as hit-and-miss as commentary tracks usually are, but they hit more often than miss. The picture and sound quality is overall very good. Recommended!Gary F.

It begins as a mystery, develops into a romance and ends up very thrilling. It is also Gothic, film noir, sometimes melodramatic and often humorous an unusual mix that really works. The opening credits show 1948 news stories about symphony conductor, Roman Strauss (Kenneth Branagh), who was executed for murdering his wife, Margaret (Emma Thompson). The film was in Black and White. Then the film switches to the present and to colour and we find Emma Thompson in a Catholics boys' home, mute and suffering from nightmares and amnesia. The priest in charge elicits free help from Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh), a private detective who specializes in missing persons and was brought up in that home. Grace (a name that she and Mike use because she does not know her real name) ends up staying with Mike while he tries to sort things out. An advertisement brings Franklyn Madson (Derek Jacobi), who offers to discover her past through hypnotic regression. He ends up regressing her into a past life. At this point, if one does not believe in reincarnation, as Mike Church did not, then one can add Fantasy to the list of the film's categories; it does very well in that category also. As fate would have it, Mike and Grace grow closer and fall in love, an event that is undoubtedly made more convincing by the fact that Branagh and Watson were happily married at the time that the film was made. The style of the modern romance contrasts with the melodrama of the 1940's marriage, in which Roman gives Margaret an anklet and says, The man I bought it from explained to me that when a husband gives this to his wife, they become two halves of the same person. Nothing can separate them, not even death. That idea helped to clarify the most surprising plot twist of all, one that is disclosed visually. The plot is one of the cleverest mystery plots that I have witnessed. One is never sure of what to think. Did Roman kill Margaret? If not then who did? Many look suspicious. What is the relationship between the past lovers, Roman and Margaret, and the present lovers, Mike and Grace? The plot has many twists and turns, all of which appear to be realistic. Clues drop like rain. There are many strong roles and the acting is excellent throughout. Many actors have roles in both stories.

Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson (who were then married)each played two roles, one in the past, one in the present, with different clothes, hairstyles and accents, as part of a couple destined to be together forever.Branagh, coming off his rookie directing debut in HENRY V, did a simply beautiful job here, using the same creative team as HV (Patrick Doyle deserves especial kudos for his astounding musical score). Playing both a cynical private eye (I'm not looking for Miss Right; I'm looking for Miss Right Now) and a jealous German composer from the 1940's, he turns in two complete portraits of unusual men, while directing as well.The film didn't stay in theaters long (most likely due to studio politics), but has apparently found a new audience on video. I've loved it since the first time I saw it, in its first run (I admit to seeing it five times in the theater and buying it on video the day it came out) -- so I may be slightly prejudiced -- but from every angle -- thriller, love story, character study -- it's a winner.

Grace, Emma Thompson,has been in this Catholic sanitarium, Saint Audrey's, since she was found wandering aimlessly on the streets of L.A. With the church not being able to keep or care for her any longer due to her deteriorating mental condition the church's administrator Father Thimothy, Richard Easton,calls a former parishioner Private eye Mike Church, Kenneth Branagh. Church is to find out just who this Grace, a name given to her by the church, really is.Putting an ad in the local L.A newspapers Church is immediately contacted by antique dealer Franklin Madson, Derek Jacobi. Madson dabbles in the occult and is experienced in the science of past-life regression; regressing persons back to their past lives through hypnosis. Madson puts Grace into a trance and regresses her back in time. It's then that Grace claims that in her previous existence she was a woman named Margrate Struss back in 1949. It was back then in 1949 that she was murdered by her husband Roman. Roman was a failing Hollywood musical composer and with his money, that he inherited from his first wife back in Germany, gone he was just about to have a nervous breakdown. Romans also suspected that Margaret was cheating on him by having an affair with newspaper reporter Gray Baker, Andy Garcia. One evening Roman just lost it and took out a pair of scissors brutally murdering Margaret. This amazing revelation, by Grace, is later confirmed through old newspapers clippings that also brought out that not only was there a Margaret and Roman Struss, back in L.A in 1948-49, but that she was also brutally murdered by her husband Roman. Mike and his assistant Pete(Wayne Knight), who later in the film makes one of the most jolting as well as unsuspecting guest appearances in motion picture history, get in touch with former psychiatrist and now grocery store owner Cozy Carlisle, Robin Williams, an expert in past-life regression. Cralisle, who was drummed out of his profession for having sex with one of his patients, tells them that past-life regressions do in fact have some truth to them and what Grace has been saying under hypnosis could very well have happened to her in a past life.The movie then takes on an almost supernatural angle to it and as its story slowly starts unfolding it becomes apparent to everyone that Grace is telling the truth but there's only one slight misrepresentation in her story! Grace wasn't Margrate Struss in her previous existence and the person who was wasn't murdered by Roman! There are surprises galore in this movie about murder madness and reincarnation and an ending that will surly blow you, like almost everyone else watching it, away. The movie is so well put together that your never allowed, by it's writer and director, to realize exactly what's going on until almost the very last five or so minutes. It's then where the truth about Grace/Margrate suddenly explodes right in your face leaving you, like it did both Grace & Mike Church, in a state of shock.Crossing different lives and time periods Dead Again in its concluding moments comes to a startling and paranormal rendezvous. It's at that point when the past suddenly catches up with the present and the mind boggling results of that time/space related conjunction become truly astonishing.

Whatever the status of Branagh and Thompson's relationship at the time, they project a fantastic chemistry as lovers karmically doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again, or so we are led to believe. Branagh has a fantastic directorial sense, honed in his years with Shakespearian theatre, and the intertwining of black-and white and colour footage to evoke different time periods works to great effect. Supporting players Derek Jacobi, Robin Williams, and Andy Garcia put in excellent performances, and the serviceable plot is made transcendant by this fine group of actors. Although some of the gore is a bit heavy, it doesn't overwhelm the story, something Branagh learned no doubt from the films of Alfred Hitchcock, and like the works of Hitchcock, even after the mystery is finally sorted out, the film continues to reward with repeat viewings. So, if the last copy of Blair Witch is out, and you're looking for a bit of suspense that isn't all blood and guts, give this one a try. You'll feel enlightened.

It has an interesting story, a couple of good jump moments, and good supporting performances from Robin Williams and whatshisname who played Newman on Seinfeld. The Hitchcock homage isn't overdone, and there are some nicely-placed visual clues (although one of them is far too obvious, the others are more subtle), as well as little references to other films the actors have been in before. Derek Jacobi is soooo good at being slimy, and the entire end sequence is tense and well-edited. That said, the big twist toward the end of the movie does poke a couple of plot holes, and causes some real loss of tension at the end of the movie- placing the big revelation much closer to the end might have made a big difference in the division of opinions about this movie. Either way, it's pretty  enjoyable- well worth renting on a rainy night.

I have to go against the grain here and say that I found the movie good enough to keep me watching once I had invested some time in it, but barely. Of course it has a (now) star-studded cast, and that wasn't really its weakness. SPOILERS FOLLOWI found the plot to be all over the place. It severely tested my suspension of disbelief. Okay, the premise is one of past lives (in which two people are somehow reincarnated into spitting images of their former selves who both live in the same city along with their original antagonists) and hypnotic regression... I can live with that for the sake of the story. But from there the plot continues to test my credulity with increasingly ridiculous, and mostly pointless events and twists- Why would Franklyn risk regressing Grace in Mike's presence, thinking that she is was his former victim (hence the whole reason he approached the two himself)? What if she immediately recalled the events as they actually happened? She might not finger his present self, but she would know the truth, the dots would be easy to connect, and the whole plot would be thrown off.- While there may have been subtle clues dropped as to the actual reincarnation identities beforehand, the whole switcheroo came off to me as a late-breaking addition, and regardless, it ultimately led nowhere. It did not impact the outcome at all and basically seemed to be an excuse to get Robin William's character in another scene. Whoever was who in the past, Franklyn was still the antagonist. And as for the memories, if Grace was actually Roman, then why was she having nightmares of being stabbed in the throat with scissors? Why was she unable to speak at the beginning of the movie, and petrified of letting people into her bedrooms when she slept? Not every dream sequence of hers fell into this category (e.g. only Roman could remember the walk to the electric chair); they're just jumbled up (why would Grace remember rebuking Inga?). To maintain suspension of belief, I need some semblance of internal consistency.- Speaking of Robin William's character, at first Dr. Carlisle implies that these sorts of past lives are rare, or at least, it is rare to uncover them in hypnosis (or was rare for him to anyway). Yet, later on, he seems to be an expert in the matter, explaining how gender swapping reincarnations happen all the time.- Mike brought Grace the anklet he recovered from Franklyn's store, and that became a symbol to her of the truth of their identities. But wouldn't the anklet have more of an emotional impact on Mike, seeing as how he was the one who was actually Margaret?Some lesser plot holes, which are common movie tropes, but (a) I expect better from a director of Branaugh's caliber (even in 1991), and (b) they reach a crescendo right at the climax, making it more of a farce to me than a drama- How is it that Mike was shot, unconscious, non-responsive and near death one moment, and the next he is not only alert, but able to engage in hand-to-hand combat with Franklyn?- Why the hell was Newman delivering a pizza to Grace's apartment in the middle of the night, when earlier it was clear she wasn't expecting anyone? Maybe I missed something there, but that just seemed so random, I didn't know whether to laugh or shout at the screen (I did both).- The climactic, slow-motion, emotional showdown was just silly.All in all, I think if the movie were presented as a dramedy, it could have sold me. But it took itself far too seriously despite the numerous what the?! moments. Somebody should have switched gears in editing.

He is one of the few Brits that can assume a very authentic American accent, which he does for the Mike Church character. His co-star is fellow Brit Emma Thompson who plays the British Margaret Strauss and the American Grace. The story involves a possible connection between a murder in 1949 and present day characters. Grace shows up at an orphanage unable to talk or remember who she is. Pretty entertaining thriller. And Branagh is especially good.SPOILERS. We learn early that Margaret Strauss was murdered and her husband, composer Roman Strauss was convicted and sentenced to death. Gray Baker (Andy Garcia) was the newspaper man who we see Strauss apparently whispering in his ear right before his execution. Near the end we find out that he didn't actually whisper anything, instead he simply kissed Baker on the cheek. We also find that the murderer was a deranged young boy who was the son of the maid. He grew up to be Frankie, an antique dealer. As the story develops we begin to suspect that Mike is the reincarnation of Roman (same actor in both roles) and Grace is the reincarnation of Margaret (same actress). However, in actually the reincarnations are crossed, Mike is actually the reincarnation of Margaret and he gets the revenge of the murdered Margaret by besting Frankie. Of course, Mike and Grace, who were in love in earlier lives, rekindle their love although with cross gender tendencies. Interesting! Robin Williams has a small role as a former shrink.

And a cocky private detective named Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh) tries to help her make sense of her personal nightmare. It's a murder mystery with twists within twists overlain with a Gothic, operatic tone.Set in Los Angeles, the clever script weaves two separate stories, one from the late 1940s, shown in B&W, and the other from the current day, shown in color. This alternating B&W and color keeps the two strands separate and therefore easy to follow. The film opens with tantalizing newspaper accounts of a 1949 murder; the victim; the probable killer (an opera composer), and related headlines such as Alibi Questioned, Composer's Prints Found On Scissors, Housekeeper Testifies, and so on.Most scenes are jam-packed with information, including exposition and character traits. Clues to the murder are wonderfully subtle. A pair of sharp scissors figures into the outcome. The 1940s segment contains a melodramatic costume party. Humor augments the serious subject matter. The plot is so dense that it can be a tad confusing, which is my only real complaint. Owing to the story's complexity, the ending goes on for some 24 minutes.Visuals are terrific. I especially liked the B&W segments, slightly grainy with noir overhead and side lighting. Prod design and costumes in both periods are elaborate, detailed, and highly believable.Casting is fine, overall; Robin Williams is perfectly cast. Acting ranges from very good to outstanding. Actor Derek Jacobi does a great job as a light, campy hypnotist with a penchant for finding cheap antiques. Consistent with the operatic theme, the music is mostly melodramatic and serious which compounds the story's Gothic intensity.The viewer needs to pay attention, else be lost in confusion. The underlying puzzle can be solved but the solution surprised me. Except for a bit too much complexity, this is a wonderful film. I plan to watch it again.

They didn't spoil the fun. I still cared about the protagonists. However, in the last scene, something happens that really strains the willingness to believe. You can't have a person that is wounded to the point of unconsciousness come quickly back to life, healthy enough to engage in a VERY physical activity, without some explanation to the other character(s),thereby explaining to the audience. Example the character could say it was only a flesh wound or I was faking how serious it was or He/she didn't hit my chest; he/she could show the other character(s)the bulletproof vest....SOMETHING. When I watched the film with voice-over commentary, neither director Kenneth Branagh nor the producer nor the writer addressed this issue, as if we are supposed to accept this without puzzlement and perhaps look at it with humor. This was the only unforgivable flaw in what was otherwise a very entertaining movie, with humor, suspense, and very good acting. I disagree that Branagh does not sound American in the Mike role. He does. Derek Jacobi is wonderful as always. Emma Thompson is an outstanding actress. I am starting to wonder why she doesn't wear eye make up in many of her films.

However, it's one of those films where you grasp more with each viewing so after watching it twice I would have to say it's a decent and enjoyable thriller.Being a big Ken Branagh fan - particularly when he's in the director's chair - I was a bit disappointed with his direction here. He dithers between a Hitchcockian noirish style and his own trademark single shot takes, which jar badly within the claustrophobic visuals. He also seems to delight in ending every other scene with a shot of a pair of scissors - by the film's end, you'll be sick of the sight of them. On the other hand, the film's opening dream sequence is highly effective, as is the repeated cutting between both eras at the film's close.Scott Frank's screenplay is horribly hammy in places (Have a nice life) and wickedly funny in others (Thank you!). I guessed the main twist early on, though thankfully the plot has quite a few interesting turns to keep you guessing.Pat Doyle's score, as usual, hits all the right notes in some scenes, then does its level best to dampen the atmosphere in others.And the acting, which is good throughout. Branagh is quite charming as Roman Strauss - love that ridiculously intense conducting - and pretty good as Mike Church. He tackles two accents here, and does well with both. Emma Thompson is her usual magnetic self. Derek Jacobi's performance will leave you with a giant smile plastered across your face - it's easy to see how he was in the final shake-up to play Hannibal Lecter. Andy Garcia doesn't really DO anything, but his scene as the old Gray Baker is very good (smoking - eeeecchhh). Robin Williams is creepy, deadpan and low key, the antithesis to his usual performances. Miriam Margolyes and Campbell Scott make funny cameos.Okay, so the final showdown is a bit ridiculous, and it's a little annoying that Mike and Grace didn't completely freak out when they saw the pictures of Roman and Margaret - but overall, this is enjoyable stuff.7/10.

The couple have such an amazing chemistry (I've probably mentioned this elsewhere) and the transcendent love oblivious of time or place is conveyed perfectly.The look of this film is beautiful. It's a classy, stylish, noir thriller, with just the right blend of love, drama, terror and revenge. The film's twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat as the viewer moves seamlessly through past and present, finally coming to an astonishing and unpredictable ending. The haunting violins and piano music provide the perfect accompaniment to the classical romance and gradual build up of tension.The changing from colour to black and white adds to the 'classic' feel and is reminiscent of an age of film making long gone. All the actors do brilliantly as well as the two leads, Andy Garcia is worth mentioning along with Robin Williams. The characters are deep and well developed, and Branagh shows his prowess at pulling off convincing American and German accents.In short, this film is breathtaking, and like any good wine, improves with age.

It also seems rather goofy how quickly the concept of reincarnation and karma is accepted as a fact by virtually everyone in the movie.

Up to the showdown with it's unintentionally funny and over the top slow motion ballyhoo, Dead Again never manages to grip the viewer. The occasional funny elements don't help, either.Is this a comedy, a drama, a romance or a mystery? Dead Again seems more like a parody at times with it's goofy black and white story lines in the past. It's a failed attempt at paying tribute to Hitchcock and the whole film noir genre. Dead Again proved that Branagh might be a master when it comes to bringing Shakespeare to the screen, but he has no idea what mainstream cinema is about.

The standard layers are the story and the modern reflections on the story. Branaugh handles this expertly by casting the effort in noir and then dancing around the form. But that's not new.What he adds is the simultaneous overlay of time. So he has himself and Emma as filmmakers, them as actors, them as the contemporary characters, and the older characters, each weaving and bobbing in and out of each other. This is the kind of thing that Branaugh does exceedingly well because he can control from both directions, actor pushing multiple characters and director pulling different views and times.My only problem with the film is the underlying purpose. Branaugh makes some films with the serious intent of moving us. Then he spends a bunch of time just having fun experimenting. We don't get much from this film because the boss isn't very interested in sending us much. And it is a little offensive to open our souls and be ignored.Also, one mourns the breakup of this great team.

I was pretty surprised by the comments on this movie, everyone either LOVED it or HATED it!  I have to confess I fall somewhere in between.  I remember enjoying it when I first saw it at the now-gone Loew's Oriental, a nice old-fashioned theater perfect for such an old fashioned movie.  Although I found it not as impressive as Kenneth Branagh's Henry V, I still enjoyed it.  The acting for the most part seemed a bit over the top, but that seemed to be in keeping with the rather far-fetched story.  I didn't really try to second guess the story, so I didn't figure out the plot twists.  And what it lacked in suspense it made up for with imaginative story elements.  My biggest complaint was that it appeared that the screenwriter had watched Citizen Kane and Spellbound once too often. I have just watched my laser disc version tonight for probably the second time, and although I still enjoyed it, I noticed some rather nit-picky plot points.  Be warned--There may be some SPOILERS ahead!When Mike Church finally meets with Gray Baker, and receives a shocking revelation,  it occurred to me that strangely enough, no one bother to ask earlier whatever happened to the housekeeper and her son!  Also, Roman Strauss the composer finds his money running low, but he refuses to compose for movies, preferring to just write his opera.  I figured him for a smart man and smart enough to know movies are where the money is--couldn't he just write his opera on the side and compose for movies for the money?  It certainly would have put less strain on the marriage. I must confess I enjoyed the performances.   Mr. Branagh seemed to be having fun as both Church and Strauss, and it was refreshing to see a PI who was not a superman like the kind of characters Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger usually play.  My feeling is that after the intensity of Henry V, Branagh wanted to play (and direct) something lighter.  Emma Thompson as Margaret and Grace is both fetching and elegant as the former, and demure yet adorable as the latter.  One of the better scenes involves Mike taking Grace on a little date where nothing goes right.  It's one of the few scenes that's not played over the top and comes off rather charming.  I read in one comment that Derek Jacobi was considered for the part of Hannibal Lechter.  I would have loved to see him play that part!  His performance is bouncy and almost comic, yet in an instant he can become coldly sinister.  He certainly fooled me until the end (the first time, anyway).  I and liked how they worked in that little I, Claudius reference.I could have done without the guy from Seinfeld, but I can see how they needed such a character to give the audience story elements.  I did enjoy Robin Williams, whom I usually cannot stand, but here he departs from the kind of annoying I'm better and funnier than everyone else characters I usually see him play.  In keeping with the outlandishness of the rest of the movie, Andy Garcia's reporter does his best to stand out as a Hunter S. Thompson type reporter.  Too bad though we never see him at a typewriter.  His old man scene is another ripoff from Citizen Kane, and he looks too much like an old Henry Winkler than an old Andy Garcia, but his smoking scene is a nice creepy touch.On a technical level, the cinematography is a treat.  It's lush and elegant in the black and white scenes, and, well, light and airy and not too obtrusive in the contemporary scenes.  It's a little too dark and atmospheric in the antique shop, where the hypno-therapy sessions take place, but again it's in keeping with the fantasy element of the reincarnation theme.Also in keeping with the over the top feel of the film is Patrick Doyle's music, exciting at times while other times it sounds too powerful for minor scenes.  It does have a nice feel of excitement to it, and it would have been nice to see him work on the recent Bond films.  So overall, a fairly entertaining bit of fluff, which I at least didn't take too seriously.  I was hoping though that Branagh would move on to more substantial material, but alas, he instead did Peter's Friends and the atrocious Francis Ford Coppola's--I mean Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.

Grace is suffering from amnesia and is in a catatonic state whereby she only speaks when she yells things out in her sleep. Grace is released in to the care of private eye Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh) who attempts to try and piece Grace's life back together and attempts to get to the bottom of who Grace is and also why she is having these strange visions. Church gets some unexpected help from antiques dealer and hypnotist Franklyn Madson (Derek Jacobi). Through a series of hypnosis sessions, Grace starts to re-discover her past life, but forming these memories again comes at a cost...Dead Again has a very impressive opening few minutes; the credits showing various tabloid articles and then the opening scene with Roman Strauss (also Kenneth Branagh) and news reporter Gray Baker (Andy Garcia) was quite chilling and it also allowed Branagh to be Hannibal Lecter for a few minutes.Once the impressive opener is out of the way, the film takes a rather slow-burning approach in developing its story. Yes it is a slow film, but it's not a film that I found boring. As with any good mystery film, all the building blocks are put in place and every scene gradually adds another piece to the puzzle. As a whole, the story is engaging, suspenseful and unpredictable and I must admit for the most part I was interested in how the events were unfolding and in which direction the story was going to take. All these elements are what make the film worth watching. However...I have to admit to being taken surprise by the turn of events later in the film specifically with regards to the idea that both Roman and Margaret had been reincarnated. I mean sure there had to be some link back to their past, but this was not what I was expecting. It becomes even more ludicrous when we learn that they've been reincarnated as different genders. It's one of those twists where I praise it because of how much it surprised me, but also one that I want to condemn for being so ludicrous. However, I'm leaning more towards being positive about because it's a rather unique twist and because it did surprise me. The issue I had with this twist is that it felt like screenwriter Scott Frank was trying to force his own beliefs on to his audience. It isn't implied here that they have been reincarnated or even suggested, but we're actually told that they have been reincarnated. To me, forcing such an agenda on people based on a concept which is merely a myth or superstition is arrogant and rather silly. Don't get me wrong I'm all for exploring the concept of reincarnation and I'm all for getting people thinking about it, but to make believe that it is real is misleading to say the least. It's heavy-handedness like this that brings the film down slightly which is a shame because it is very effective in almost every other area.Despite the heavy-handed and questionable reincarnation twist, the film does get a lot of praise from me for having an involving, suspenseful and unpredictable storyline. Many of the performances here help make the picture enjoyable and the likes of Branagh, Jacobi and Thompson were all excellent - although I only found Branagh compelling as Roman Strauss and didn't think he was as good in his role of private eye Mike Church. Garcia is OK in a supporting role, Williams did OK with what he had to work with - his character was interesting, but his role was severely underwritten. Wayne Knight was annoying and for me was an unnecessary and distracting addition to the film.As it is Dead Again is a very good film, but one that could have been even better with a less heavy-handed approach.

The romance part, between Kenneth Branagh as detective in the present falling in love with the amnesiac Emma Thompson, almost brings the movie to a halt in Act 2. It runs too long and the on-screen love/chemistry is absent. However, the depiction of their love in the past, in 1948, as two completely different persons, is very good and very passionate. The past flashbacks done in black and white are more entrancing, mysterious and convincing than the present that's filmed in color. Branagh does very good work in the 1948 part of the film. This contrast is an example of the uneven character of the film. Apart from the music and cinematography, much else is uneven. This especially includes the story, Branagh's direction, and his acting.The search for identity is a common neo-noir theme, and this is at the heart of the film because Emma Thompson's character has lost her memory and is having nightmares. This story element's weakness as noir is that its origin seems to lie in the supernatural of a confused reincarnation, and that's rather opposed to or distant from what we might think of as a general condition of mankind or a general noir theme. We are simply not given to understand her predicament or see it as anything more than a one-off strange case.The supernatural here is mumbo-jumbo and confusing mumbo-jumbo at that, not even resolving its own premises and mysteries to a satisfying degree. Loose ends abound. Invoking karma and identity switches does not satisfy the requirements of a really good story. We badly need to understand the motivations of those involved. Noir and the supernatural do not mix easily under the best of circumstances.The mystery is on the simple side when all is said and done, but the attempt here is to dress it up or obscure it or hide it with various diversions. Some of these are simply not well done. Branagh is taking a page from Orson Welles's book, but as director he lacks the visual flair of Welles and falls back upon mundane staging much of the time and overly-flamboyant staging at others. Branagh does have flair at times. The thriller element in the film is minimal. The story develops our curiosity but not in a suspenseful way or a way in which we feel continuing or rising perils to the principals, until we get nearer the end.Branagh's acting is mannered. The two men he plays both beg to be liked. His accent is of course borderline, but this is and always has been true of most British actors who attempt to speak like an American. Emma Thompson in the movie's 1948 past does some excellent work, as in the scene where she meets Andy Garcia. His screen presence is typically interesting, but his enunciation remains questionable. Derek Jacobi is a high point in most movies and no exception here. Robin Williams has an unbilled part wherein he receives many closeups and provides material about reincarnation. He seems to have enjoyed doing it.This movie invokes vastly different and opposite reactions from those who are entranced by its flashiness and the story's mystery and those who see its evident imperfections. I personally found it interesting enough but not really involving and not deep. To me it's something of a curiosity. It needed more work on the story before it could even become a candidate for a great movie.

It is extremely evocative of the films of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock and the film noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s. There is a wonderful reference to Citizen Kane in the scene in which Mike Church visits the elderly Gray Baker in a nursing home for information and he repeatedly asks for tobacco, as the elderly Jed Leland did in that film. The flawless and completely engrossing script was written by Scott Frank, who more recently wrote the decidedly lacklustre The Wolverine. It is full of fantastic twists and marvellous dialogue. The cinematography is beautiful and the long uninterrupted takes, one of Branagh's trademarks, are brilliantly done, the best example being the first hypnosis scene. I have always been very nervous of knives and large scissors - perhaps I had a bad experience with them in a past life too! - so I found those parts of the film, particularly the denouement, extremely frightening. It took a few minutes after the film ended for my heart rate to return to normal.Branagh excels not only as a director but an actor too, playing the dual roles of Roman Strauss and Mike Church to perfection. The same is true of his then wife Emma Thompson as Margaret Strauss and Grace. It's a shame that they got divorced as their on screen chemistry is always electric, never more so than in Much Ado About Nothing. The best performance in the film, however, comes from Derek Jacobi who is spellbinding as Franklyn Madson, particularly towards the end of the film. He was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor and should have received an Oscar nomination for the equivalent award. The film is pretty much dominated by those three actors but it also has strong performances from Wayne Knight, Robin Williams (in one of his first completely serious roles) and Hanna Schygulla. As I said in my review of The Godfather Part III, I don't think that Andy GarcÃ­a is a great actor but he was certainly better than in that film as he was given far more interesting material in spite of his far more limited screen time. That brings me to my only real criticism of the film the old age make-up that he wore was rubbish. There is also a lovely and hilarious cameo by an uncredited Miriam Margoyles but Branagh's mascot Richard Briers is conspicuously absent.Overall, this is my second favourite film directed by Branagh after Hamlet and one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen.

We didn't ask any questions as she sauntered around Wonderland; we let her do the talking, while we, drink in hand, sat back and hoped she would get into enough trouble to provide for a hoot of a story. We couldn't put ourselves in her shoes &#x97; no one has had a tea party with a zany hat enthusiast (except maybe Liza Minnelli or some other unpredictable broad) &#x97; but we were more than willing to act as a sidekick during her so-called journey.Kenneth Branagh, more or less, asks us to do the same thing with Dead Again, a mystery/thriller/fantasy/romance/film noir (yes, it is comprised of that many genres) that spirals into the realms of lustrous cinema, defying explanation. This isn't the kind of movie that hits you over the head with its pragmatism, though; it is, rather, a sweeper in the same category of a Michael Curtiz sudser. You lose yourself in its reverie. Branagh has done something highly original here, even if it does eventually get trapped within the stickiness of its many convulsions. It takes the best components of a 1940s melodrama, the finest ingredients of a neo-noir, and concocts something simultaneously retro and modern. The results travel back and forth between head-scratching and engrossing, but remaining is Branagh's knowing eye for film, and what makes it so magical in the first place.Dead Again introduces itself with a slap and a bang of headlines. Vintage newspapers are slammed in our faces, enthusiastically announcing the murder of Margaret Strauss (Emma Thompson), a prominent concert pianist. The world has decided that her husband, composer Roman Strauss (Branagh), is guilty, and, without missing a beat, grabs him by the hand and leads him to the electric chair. If this isn't a tragic romance, then I don't know what is. The film then transitions into a black-and- white setting, moments before Strauss's death; we think we're about to get a full-blooded noir homage of The Man Who Wasn't There dedication, but not quite.Just as things are about to get interesting, bang! the sensibilities of modern filmmaking techniques fill the screen. The jump from 1948 to 1991 is startling; but even more startling are the characters we come to meet. One is an amnesiac named Grace (Thompson); the other is a private detective, Mike Church (Branagh). And no, these fictional entities are not merely the result of prominent actors playing dual roles. Mike is called by a friend to try to help Grace figure out her true identity &#x97; but things, expectedly, turn out to be much more complicated than ever expected. It seems that Grace can only recall the details of Margaret Strauss's life, and Mike, as realistic as he is, is beginning to experience similar sensations.They enlist the help of an eccentric hypnotist (Derek Jacobi) who doubles as an antique dealer. Throughout their many encounters, it becomes abundantly clear that Mike and Grace may very well be the reincarnations of the doomed Strauss's; and romance, along with danger, are following close behind.Dead Again is borderline ludicrous, but doubts arrive long after the film is over; we're kept too busy to notice a flaw. Unlike Branagh's many other movies, this is not a film only for the intellectual crowd. It is also for those who are (a) looking for a glorious romantic thriller, or (b) are huge fans of classic cinema. It's popcorn entertaining, easy to absorb and hard to dislike. Our brains are buzzing, our hearts pounding with the promise of romance, suspense. Branagh takes a number of risks (how about that unexpected ending?), considering he photographs every Strauss flashback in magnificent black-and-white and fancies the tracking shot techniques of Hitchcock. Most pay off; the twists are what weaken the film, not its cinematic techniques.But I suppose I'm only nitpicking. One shouldn't complain about such things when talking about a movie that places reincarnation at its front- and-center. Fact is, Thompson and Branagh are wonderful together (they were husband and wife during filming, after all), and Dead Again is ingenious in its aesthetic and conception. It doesn't go as deep as one would hope, turning out to be much simpler than originally expected (considering its many complications). But this is grand escapism that ties a cherry knot in our minds and leaves us intrigued.

The segments that make up 1948-1949 portion are in black and white flashbacks, and focus on the tragic love affair of music composer and conductor Roman (Kenneth Branagh) and pianist Margaret Strauss (Emma Thompson). The opening montage is made of compiled newspaper headlines and clippings that scream about the murder of Margaret (MURDER . . . TRIAL . . . GUILTY . . .). We quickly learn that Roman was convicted and executed for the scissor-murder of his wife. Roman goes to the electric chair proclaiming his innocence. Margaret had been suspicious that ominous housekeeper Inga (Hanna Schygulla) and her strange and stuttering son Frankie (Gregor Hesse) may have stolen jewelry items from Roman. But Inga had saved Roman from Hitler, so she kept her position. In turn, Roman was unhappy that his wife seemed to have taken an inordinate amount of interest with newspaper writer Gray Baker (Andy Garcia). The early 1990s part involves private investigator Mike Church (Branagh again), who has been asked by Father Timothy (Richard Easton), a priest, to unearth the identity of a woman (Thompson again) who has lost both her voice and her memory. She experiences terrible nightmares. Church had intended to drop off Thompson at the local madhouse, but after seeing conditions there he decided to put her up for a night or two. He gives her a faux-name, Grace. Helpful newspaper man Piccolo Pete (Wayne Knight) puts her photograph in the local rag. Peculiar hypnotist (and antique dealer on the side!), Franklyn Madison (Derek Jacobi) responds quickly. Now Franklyn believes that a trauma from the woman's past is causing mute amnesia. When Franklyn, with permission from Mike Church, places Grace under hypnotism, she begins to have visions from the 1940s, i.e., Roman and Margaret's life (before Grace was born). Grace soon regains her voice, but not her memory. As she begins to grow closer to Mike, she notices the similarities between their lives and the previous ones of Roman and Margaret. As she looks even deeper into her past, she begins to fear Mike, feeling that &#x96; like Roman earlier &#x96; he will eventually kill her (as he is apparently Roman re-incarnated). But did Roman really kill Margaret? At a critical point Church tells Grace, I would never hurt you, MARGARET (Freudian slip), Grace screams right away. Cozy Carlisle (Robin Williams), ex-psychiatrist turned supermarket worker, soon warns Mike that he should indeed kill Grace before she kills him because fate is what it is. There are similarities between past and present lives. Reincarnation also means that one may return in a different gender Grace could be Roman while Mike may be Margaret (heavy stuff here)! After researching, Piccolo Pete tells Grace that her real name is Amanda Sharp, an artist who lost her memory after being mugged. (Note the Salvador Dali copy of his famous painting in her spacious apartment (The Persistence of Memory). After, when Mike agrees to be hypnotized, he uncovers a startling secret. When Mike later locates the aged and decrepit Gray in a wretched condition at a nursing facility, he is told that Inga the housekeeper knew everything that went on in the Strauss household. When asked about her and son Frankie, Gray says They had opened some sort of shop . . . AN-tiques. Mike's utter surprise sets up the denouement. Under Patrick Doyle's rousing musical score, there is a grand operatic clash with slow-motion shots and with cuts between the (black and white) past and (color) present times. It is a bit pretentious, though (but dig those gigantic scissors!).Yes, the story is complicated and relies on coincidence but it is a good tale, and very inventive. Each of the plot twists is given suitable build-up that avoids viewer confusion. One gets so swept away with the yarn and buys into the story that he/she ignores the coincidences (like Mike's meeting with Grace/Amanda in the first place). The character development is at a high level, while the sets and scenes are imaginatively well-done. Acting performances are first-rate. Derek Jacobi (of I, Claudius fame) is excellent as the hypnotist with a sinister agenda. An innovative touch occurs when he puts folks under not just to obtain information about the past, but also to pry from subconscious minds the whereabouts of certain antiques that may somehow fetch him big dollars. Robin Williams, as Cozy Carlisle, believing that the world has thoroughly porked him, leaves no room for anything but the blackest of humor in his top performance. Kenneth Branagh directed, and he and his then wife Emma Thompson shared the lead roles of both eras effectively, with the nod going to the latter. Matthew Leonetti's cinematography is effective at capturing moods. Whether or not you want believe in reincarnation does not matter (this writer does not) as the film's entertainment value is high. But you need to pay close attention to the story!

There are story gaps you could drive a truck through (or at least a little roadster like the one featured in the movie.)But who cares? Thanks to Kenneth Branagh in a dual role as a classical composer and a Los Angeles private eye, Emma Thompson as a stricken waif (who may be the reincarnation of a murder victim,) Robin Williams as a certifiably insane defrocked psychiatrist currently hauling cartons in a supermarket and Derek Jacobi as an antique dealer cum hypnotist, it's well worth watching. The story spins between a headline-making homicide in 1948 and the present, changing from black-and-white to saturated color as it rolls along. I'd say more but I don't want to risk a spoiler alert by telling who did what to whom and with which -- even if I understood it. But that hardly matters; I certainly enjoyed it.

It is a little confusing to have Emma Thompson in both the past and the present.

"},{"Title":"Very Original and Enjoyable Film!","Date":"12 February 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Dead Again is one of the best films of the 1990s. It is a psychological thriller that will require your full attention. This includes the opening credits which provide critical background information. In the opening credits, you see old newspaper clippings from 1949 about the shocking death of pianist Margaret Strauss (Emma Thompson). Based on the clippings, we learn that Margaret's husband, conductor-composer Robert Strauss (Kenneth Branagh) claims a thief killed Margaret but he is later arrested for the crime after his fingerprints are found on a pair of scissors. Testimony from witnesses as well as his refusal to testify results in a guilty verdict and Strauss gets the death penalty. Most of the newspaper articles were written by Gray Baker (Andy Garcia) who visits Strauss at his request on the day of his execution. Strauss asks Baker to print that He loved his wife and that he will love her forever while getting his hair sheard with scissors by one of the guards. Baker asks Strauss why he is not afraid of death and Strauss states that he is not because things are far from over. When Baker states, But you still killed her, didn't you?, Strauss gets up and whispers something in his ear. Strauss is then escorted down the hallway to the death chamber. As Baker gets up to leave, he looks at the newspaper that was next to Strauss and notices the scissors that the guard had laid down are missing. We then see the scissors in Strauss's hand as Baker runs down the hallway yelling stop to Strauss. At the end of the hallway is a vision of Margaret Strauss and then we see Robert Strauss reach out and begin to stab her. We're instantly snapped forward into color (from black and white) and a modern day Emma Thompson awakes from her nightmare where she appears to live on the same property as where the Strauss' used to live. Now all of this happens during the first five minutes of the movie and if you're not hooked, then something's really wrong! The film goes back and forth between the past (always shown in black and white) and current day (shown in color). Suspicions abound as we piece together details from past lives and how they relate to the current characters. In doing so, we are left on the edge of our seats as new facts and twists are revealed.This is a thinking person's movie with a load of originality. If you like Hitchcock movies or you find films like the Matrix and Inception to be thrilling because of the twists and/or strong focus you must have while watching, you'll appreciate this film.

As she starts remembering more it seems someone is setting out to kill her--but who and why.Intriguing mystery/thriller with supernatural touches. The script is good and the story has many twists and turns. They do give you clues to who is doing it along the way so you might be able to figure it out. However I couldn't when I first saw it in 1991 and loved it. I STILL love it even though I knew how it was going to end. The acting is great. Branagh (who also directed) completely buries his Irish accent and is lots of fun. Thompson is just fantastic in her role. They were also great in the flashback sequences which are in gorgeous black and white. Jacobi is good too and having fun in his role.

One flaw with the film is that it is a little too long, by about four or so minutes. The other flaw I had was that I felt the ending was overdone, though not as overdone as the remake of The Wicker Man thank goodness. Still Dead Again is stylish, dark and entertaining, with stunning cinematography and film noir and Hitchockian elements, eccentric plotting, the usual twists and turns and a good script.Another strong asset was the score, the opening theme was very bombastic and haunting. The direction is decent, and the acting was fine. Kenneth Branagh acquits himself well in a very difficult dual role, one of the cynical LA private detective and the other of the composer executed for the murder of his wife back in 1949, while Emma Thompson is terrific also in a dual role as an amnesiac woman obsessed with scissors and is suffering from nightmares of somebody else's life and the composer's wife.Andy Garcia, Derek Jacobi, Robin Williams and Wayne Knight are also fine in their supporting roles, Jacobi especially. Overall, this is definitely worth watching even with its flaws. 8/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Surprisingly good","Date":"17 April 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Some movies are so complex that they become a house of cards; any slip up and the movie collapses. Face/Off, Memento, Donnie Darko are among them. Dead Again is like that, although it has nothing in common with any of the movies I've listed. This is a complex movie, and while it stretches credibility to its limits, it is for the most part perfectly coherent, and it does something that most movies are unable to do build suspense.A woman (Emma Thompson) was found trying to break into a convent. She doesn't speak and appears to be harmless, so the nuns let her stay there. But she has violent nightmares every night, and the nuns get a private investigator named Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh) to find out who she is. A hypnotist named Franklyn Madson (Derek Jacobi) offers to help, and under hypnosis, she begins revealing an interesting story from the past the high profile murder of Margaret Strauss (Emma Thompson) by her husband, Roman (Kenneth Branagh). Madson thinks it might be memories of a past life, and as the evidence piles up, is Grace (as Mike names her) now in danger?It's a very complex story, and save for one scene, it's well told. Hitchcock lovers would do themselves a favor by checking out this thriller (despite references to a murder with a pair of scissors, this isn't a slasher movie). It's a fascinating story and the suspense builds slowly and surely to the tension-wracked end.The acting is top-notch. Kenneth Branagh has what is arguably the toughest job. He plays two completely different characters, neither of which are in his comfort zone. Branagh would probably be the last person on anyone's list to play a 40's era noir gumshoe, but he acquits himself quite well actually. His portrayal of the musician is just as good. Branagh's then-wife, Emma Thompson, gives an equally terrific performance. She's an amnesiac, but we really grow to like her, and her romances with Mike (as Grace) and Roman (as Margaret) are very effective. What is really surprising is that the romance between Roman and Margaret Strauss is effective, and that gives the film another level that the film wouldn't have had if it was treated as a mere plot device. Derek Jacobi is delicious as Madson, the hypnotist. I don't want to give anything away, but Jacobi plays him in a delightfully (but effectively) off-the-wall manner. Brief, but important appearances by Robin Williams (as a former psychiatrist) and Wayne Knight (as Mike's friend at the newspaper) are also effective. Special mention has to go to Campbell Scott, who despite being in only one scene, is very good (watch his reaction shot at the climax of his scene).Kenneth Branagh is known for bringing Shakespeare to the screen. He has adapted a number of The Bard's plays successfully, including making at masterful, uncut version of Hamlet (also starring Jacobi). But his love letter to film noir is also an suspenseful entry into the genre, and the plot (from a script penned by Scott Frank) is twisted enough to bring back memories of those potboilers.Suspenseful and emotionally effective, Dead Again is forgotten thriller that should be better known than it is. "},{"Title":"Interesting diversion for Branagh and co.","Date":"2 October 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" The thrillers of the 1980s were films about dangerous relationships (a stage set by 'Fatal Attraction') - the dominant type of thrillers of the 1990s (probably thanks in no small part to the success of TV show 'The X-Files') was a more supernatural type story. This film released in the very early 1990s has aspects of both. It prefigured the '90s supernatural thriller trend by a few years, but it stands up pretty well against most of the others that followed. And, while the modern scenes are now a little dated (the film has a parallel storyline set in the 1940s), it's still quite enjoyable.Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, best known for their Shakespeare adaptations, co-star in this 80s style thriller crossed with 40s style film noir. It's highly recommended to fans of both those genres - though like most supernatural thrillers, one must suspend disbelief in the supernatural premise to fully enjoy it.Great supporting cast made up of talented character actors helps move things along, and while there are some lame attempts at humor, they're more quirky than cringe-inducing.The music score is essential to this one, so be sure to have a good stereo set up!

Partly because there are so many switches and surprises. A 40's era murder suddenly makes itself known through present-day people in a switching game of the souls, but don't judge too quickly. While you might think you know what's going on, things switch up near the end of the movie and, with one or two exceptions, you get some fun twists that make you feel as if you haven't wasted your time. That, together with good acting by all involved (though Jacobi does camp it up a bit, especially at the end) makes it a fun movie to watch. And you know the actors are having fun making it as well, which helps. I especially enjoyed the appearances of Robin Williams in his short, but memorable appearances which mixed humor and irony. One of the flaws of the movie was that he could have been used much more in the plot. The fact that he wasn't was another (disappointing) surprise.So if you enjoy surprises, you might enjoy this shell game of souls.

Well, despite the fact that some of his lines are funny, he's not playing a funny character.  He's playing a former psychiatrist, disbarred because of unprofessional conduct with his female patients, reduced to working in the meat department in a grocery store.  His eyes are desperate; his face is drawn, tired and unhappy.  You can practically smell the sour smell of flop sweat.  This is not the Robin Williams of Good Morning, Vietnam or Dead Poets' Society, for all that they were serious roles.

I suppose I should mention somewhere in here that simply looking at Branagh was enough for large parts of the movie - as well as being good-looking, he's a good actor, the kind where you can stare at his wonderful face and not have to start laughing because some of his facial expressions look so odd. You can just believe in the role he's playing. The end was so outrageous, but somehow I still managed to get into it. I was watching Dead Again the same night I watched Psycho and The Fall of the House of Usher, on a Friday the 13 movie night, so I was expecting some cheesy horror/thriller film. It was so much better than that comedy, romance, and some thriller elements. I recomend this movie to absolutely anyone, and I'm planning on buying it the next time I'm at a video store.

People keep saying how easy it is to spot the plot twists and that the ending is not that surprising.  I agree.  If you are looking for the surprise ending at the expense of actually watching the movie and getting into the characters then you might be able to pick out the surprise endings to this movie as well as others (The Usual Suspects, Sixth Sense, Primal Fear)  but you are robbing yourself of the experience.  Therefore I ask that those who read this see this top notch thriller and enjoy it.  The movie, under the direction of Kenneth Branagh, succeeds on many levels.  It works as a romance because of Branagh and Thompson's incredible chemistry.  It is a wonderful mystery with excellent plot twists.  It also works as a thriller.  Dead Again is also an original idea which is something that Hollywood is far too lacking in.

Is she the reincarnation of the victim? And has her killer also been reincarnated as her detective/lover? The paranormal hook, with the entire cast playing their earlier selves in flashback, adds an entertaining twist to the otherwise cheap but lively whodunit scenario. And Branagh, perhaps wanting to prove himself a real Hollywood filmmaker, doubles the fun by pitching the action and performances to the edge of hysteria. His phony California accent is no more convincing than his broad directorial flourishes (note the use of TV-style close-ups, even in the black and white retro-noir flashbacks), but the film never pretends to be anything more than what it is silly, sub-Hitchcock fluff for a not quite jaded summertime crowd.

Then the story begins; a woman who has stopped talking is shopped around town (L.A.) to learn why, and who she is.How on earth did everyone imagine this was Branagh's take on Hitchcock? He's really toying with Welles (and noir), specifically 'Mr Arkadin' with its masquerade and bearded Orson. But with viewers not knowing their history (about anything) and unable to communicate, you get misconceptions like that. And, it's a whodunit. How many whodunits did Hitch make&#x85; two? Instead Branagh wants to BE Orson Welles, and the camera work is noticeably fluid, but Welles worst movie (pick one, there are lots) has far superior lighting, compositions, tonal range and camera work. Welles was intoxicated by celluloid beauty and B&W helped him find it. Noir uses the screen so much better than this. Color makes peoples eyes lazy, as here. But it's easy to see why this cops out; the story is so surface-deep they may have concluded it couldn't support too much originality in the visuals. However, a frequently roaming camera does provide one remarkable, nice extended shot in the first hypnosis session.Brit Branagh has no feel for L.A., and has created a bizarro L.A. that is peopled mostly by Brits; lipless Branagh, unconventional Thompson and stagebound Jacobi; both men looking doughy. The twist here is interesting but it comes about half an hour before a solution that is beneath everyone. In the end I can't tell you at all how the twist contributes anything to the conclusion. As with most movies, the more explanation that is hurriedly provided in the climax, the worse the movie gets. I can't even imagine what people think these shallow last-minute resolutions do for them.

As such, many films slipped through the net; thus meaning that there's a lot of nineties films that never became big hits, yet were great nonetheless. When I discovered Dead Again in my TV guide, I was hoping that this film may be one of the aforementioned 'hidden gems' - but suffice to say, it wasn't. That's not to say that Kenneth Branagh's film is bad, not by any means; but it has too many problems, which stop it from fulfilling it's potential. The plot is one of those that has every chance of going wrong, given that it takes place across two time periods and features elements such as reincarnation. The plot follows the murder of Margaret Strauss, apparently committed by her husband; composer Roman Strauss. We then cut to the present, where Los Angeles private detective, Mike Church, takes on the case of a mysterious woman suffering from amnesia. In order to help her regain her memories, Church hires a hypnotist; and it soon comes to light that the woman's nightmares of the Strauss murder may be more than what they seem.I love films with original and weird plots, which is what attracted me to this one in the first place. The plot here is good; but it's not handled very well. The way that the film switches back and forward between the two time periods is ham-fisted and doesn't translate to the screen very well. It's also very difficult to really care for any of the characters, as most of the screen time is spent on building up the plot rather than spending time with the characters. The film suffers from a rather dull first half, but it really picks up in the second when the twists start to come into play. My TV guide described the film as Hitchcockian - I wouldn't go that far personally, but the twists do make it enjoyable. The film is, however, very lacking in the substance department. A film with reincarnation at its core really should be making you think; but this one is more of a straight thriller, so don't expect to have your brain taxed. On the whole, I don't recommend missing this film; but I don't recommend going out of your way to see it either. Dead Again is a film to be viewed when it's on TV and you need a film to watch.

One might say despite the fact they were married, yet I would argue that too often whatever chemistry causes an off-screen couple to hook-up simply does not translate to the movies. In fact in many cases it seems to create a negative chemistry on screen. (Think Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.) Since Dead Again is at its heart a love story, the lack of chemistry is deadly. Branagh and Thompson play two couples. The first, filmed in beautiful black and white, are an angry World War 2 refugee and opera composer and his murdered wife. He goes to the chair for her murder and we flash forward to Branagh as a missing persons detective and Thompson as a crazy mute lady with amnesia. They may be connected to the previous couple and both stories are told alternately throughout the film.The film itself (in particular the black and white flashbacks) is gorgeous, yet Branagh as a director plays too many tricks for his own good. He cribs so liberally from Hitchcock that the film threatens to turn into High Anxiety 2 rather than an original work.Without the chemistry between the leads we are left with little more than a hundred film school in-jokes and a strange sci-fi mystical story that we simply have no stake in.

A composer (Branagh) was executed for the murder of his wife (Thompson). Somehow, a reporter (Garcia) seems to have been involved but he's just a red herring. Forget him.Anyway, it's now forty years later, 1988 that is, and Emma Thompson is an amnesiac taken in by Branagh because she has no identity and nowhere to go. A hypnotist and antique dealer insinuates his way into the relationship that, as the sophisticated viewer will have already guessed, has turned physically demonstrative. The hypnotist age regresses Thompson and she begins reliving the 1948 case in which she was the victim.Branagh, a fundamentally decent guy, consults Robin Williams, an ex shrink who now runs a Carniceria.

The two are reliving the 1948 murder only the genders are reversed.But Williams is a red herring too. The whole business about karma is a red herring. And at the end, when the villain tries to murder Thompson with a pair of antique scissors -- hint, hint -- that's a lot of baloney too because Thompson has no connection with the earlier murder, as far as it's possible to tell.

All of them live in those pretentious mansions of Southern California except for Jacobi and his dear mother, who are consigned to one of those cluttered little spaces out of Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop.

I liked his Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. But Dead Again, while starting off with a good idea, went a bit too far.Branagh plays detective Mike Church. He ends up helping an amnesic woman named Grace (Emma Thompson) try to discover her past. Several flashbacks by Grace show that she and Mike are the reincarnations of two former lovers. When a hypnotherapist appears and offers to help Grace further discover her past and the cause of her nightmares, things begin to get a bit too coincidental and dangerous.Dead Again is anything but a scary film, despite it's title. Branagh uses half the film on flashbacks of the past and other on the present in order to display how Grace and Mike have a romantically tragic history. But despite this clever and poetic tale's attempts, Branagh goes to far in certain respects, where irony becomes gratuitous. I can't go into any details without ruining the film, but suffice it to say that there are a few surprises that come across as more ridiculous than crafty. These unfortunates aside, the film has some good acting by Thompson and Branagh himself. Andy Garcia makes several appearances as journalist Gray Baker. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Out of its misery","Date":"10 July 2000","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Somehow this film escaped me in the 90's. I am sorry not to still be running from it.There's a lot of talent here, not the least of which is writer Scott Frank. For his first lavishly produced script, it isn't too bad. I'm a sucker for a stylish, tight thriller but halfway through this pretender I had resorted to open mockery.'Dead Again' is utterly preposterous, without humor or connection- what intrigue there is is all artiface to prop up the nonsensical plot. Lumbering along while liberally squandering talent, on the way to a ludicrously violent, incoherent climax, several Falstaff-sized plot holes go ignored, much less explained.The director once again confirms my suspicion, that he is sub-par when without the choicest source material (ie, Shakespeare). Performance-wise, his 'aw-shucks' approach to the PI is at best neglectful, while his direction is mediocrity at its finest (for added cringes, be sure to listen to the DVD commentary).Comparison between double bills of 'Chimes at Midnight' and 'Touch of Evil' with 'Henry V' and 'Dead Again' is revealing. Where Welles showed himself to be a revolutionary interpreter of genre, Branagh just props himself up on the shoulders of giants.'Dead Again' wants to be a noir fantasy, and in trying so hard to meld those genres it's a good example of neither.

Lets see, the facts It's a film about incarnation; it's a film about karma; and the film is unlikely to end obviously.  So my guess is pretty simple yes, incarnation is at play; BUT the incarnated souls are not who they appear to be.  What, then, is the big mystery?  He's actually her, and she's actually him.  Right?  It's so obvious.  If I'm wrong about this, I will post another review boasting about how truly surprising this film is, but I'm willing to wager my own karma that I'm unlikely to be wrong in this case.Well... besides being painfully predictable, and about as suspenseful as an overweight cow during her feeding hour, the film is not an entirely terrible comedy.  The acting is not bad, the reason it looks so unrealistic is because it is extremely overly dramatic, which is not necessarily a sign of acting failure.  It would be perfectly acceptable if this were a comedy, which is exactly what this is.  Granted, it's not a great comedy, but it's not bad...  the humour is not extremely witty, but it's funny never-the-less.So, if you can watch this as a comedy, you probably won't hate it.  But if you want to take it seriously you're probably better off watching something else.Well, back to watching and waiting for the ending that's so utterly obvious to me.

As I stated in the last preview, the gender-switching reincarnation issue was as obvious as I anticipated.  But that turned out to be just a setup for the real ending.  So... I was wrong on at least that account.  I was also wrong to assume that this was merely an ok comedy, since it turned out to be quite a great one.  The ending is simply hilarious.  This works as a damn great black comedy, but for anyone to think that this was actually suspenseful... well, I frankly don't know what's wrong with you.So... for being a pretty funny comedy, I'll amuse myself and give this film a 10.  If I were taking it seriously, I'd give it a 2 at most, but serious it was not.  There's another Kenneth Branagh film that I will have to reconsider now, that film was Frankenstein, which left me with the impression that Kenneth Branagh is an incompetent fool as a director.  After seeing Dead Again, which employed an equal amount of extremely unrealistic dramatic acting, I realize perhaps I missed the point.  Like the original Frankenstein, that film was probably also meant to be a comedy.  Silly me.  Then again, probably Branagh really is incompetent, but in his incompetence manages to make fun of himself pretty well.  I guess we'll never know.Congratulations, Kenneth, you get my high marks on Dead Again for making me laugh, just don't disappoint me and try to claim that you were dead serious when you were making this movie.

Watch it and be in awe with my achievements!","Date":"14 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Always an actor/producer/director who relied on theatrical elements in his films, Kenneth Branagh is a man that I can't take seriously. This film, depending on your point-of-view, can be considered a masterpiece of suspense, a camp classic, or the worst film you've ever seen. Since it's so difficult for me to take Branagh seriously, this film is definitely a camp classic to my eyes. Despite some gripping moments here and there, the film contained so many clichÃ©s of the genre that the plot was less plausible than a Scooby Doo episode.The film is enjoyable and some plot elements are somewhat atypical of the mystery genre, but Branagh's acting and directing style are so melodramatic that the whole film seems like some sort of parody. Here Branagh relies on a stereotypical American accent and a poor German accent in the dual role of an LA gumshoe of the present and a German composer of the past. His American accent is so exaggerated that he sounds like a Canadian in several scenes! His German accent sounds like an Englishman struggling to do an imitation of Austrian actor Anton Walbrook. And, of course, there's the usual Kenny Branagh facial expressions that are straight out of Saturday morning cartoons&#151;if you've ever wanted to see Ken get kicked in the groin and see the reaction on his face, then this is your chance.The other cast members are equally hilarious despite the display of their talents in other and better films. Emma Thompson grits her teeth and rolls her wide eyes whenever she's in terror as Branagh's love interest. Derek Jacobi delivers a suave performance that's reminiscent of Claude Rains in NOTORIOUS (1946)&#133;but without Rains' subtle acting. And one scene, Andy Garcia appears in old age makeup that's hokey enough to make him resemble a Muppet. And, of course, special mention goes to Robin Williams, who delivers some hilarious one-liners despite his intentionally serious acting in the film.The plot is ludicrous&#133;but I won't spend my time writing it down. And the film's finale is so contrived and silly that you'll be experiencing laughs instead of thrills. Branagh's directing style goes overboard here, delivering some of the hammiest acting I've ever seen in a film that didn't star Bette Davis. Wait until you see what happens to Derek Jacobi! I almost died laughing.However, Patrick Doyle's music score is very good. Since Branagh seemingly attempted to imitate the incomparable directing style of Alfred Hitchcock, Doyle succeeds in delivering a music score that Bernard Herrmann would have been proud of. Special mention should also go to Matthew F. Leonetti's cinematography, which relies on the use of stark black-and-white for the film's flashback sequences.But Branagh is no Hitchcock. This film is even more enjoyable on DVD listen to Kenneth Branagh's stuffy audio commentary and hear how many times he gives a high opinion of this film&#133;and of himself. If you can't take Kenneth Branagh seriously, then the DVD is recommended viewing. Watch, enjoy, and laugh.The film is followed by a sequel, DEAD AGAIN AGAIN. ;-) "},{"Title":"Incredibly far-fetched hokus-pokus","Date":"30 September 2004","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Expecting a thriller of the film noire genre, I was quite disappointed to see an unbelievably far-fetched story, with suggestions about re-incarnation at its center. The leads, as well as the supporting cast appear instantly at ease with believing in re-incarnation, as well as the power of fate. The character of a former psychiatrist-turned-meat-cutter, played by Robin Willimas, not only instantly buys the life after death hokus pokus, but without hesitation suggests that the main character kill his wife from a former life, to beat her to the punch. Towards the end there is an elaborate multi-layered scene that is rather fascinating. It lasts about 2-3 minutes. The rest of the film is insultingly ridiculous. If you must see this huddled mess of a film, watch for how one of the supporting characters speaks with an exaggerated German accent, decades later the accent is an exaggerated British one. The identical looks of characters who died some 40 years ago (captured by LIFE magazine stories) and the present day counter parts doesn't seem to phase any of the characters. I have never seen Emma Thompson in a lesser film. A 3 out of 10 points Luke-warm thriller. This effort is forgettable. Save yourself the disappointment, I wish I had.
