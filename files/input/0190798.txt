An award winning film hailed by the critics and an exemplar for American Indie makers,  Solas will appeal most to more mature audiences into Europix.

However, if you liked Almodóvar's excellent drama you will also like 'Solas'. The two films have certain similarities inasmuch that also in 'Solas' the accent is very much on strong characterisation, profound human feelings, though perhaps a little less intense here than in Almodóvar's film. Ana Fernández is magnificent, playing just right the rather confused, unlucky thirty-five year old young woman a bit given to alcohol, not overplaying her part; María Galiana as her mother shows even at her age that she has come from good theatre, as no less does Carlos Álvarez-Novoa as the lonely neighbour. Benito Zembrano - as Almodóvar - , not only directs his film but is also responsible for the script, which is truly magnificent, especially taking into account certain Andalucian styles of speech. The Andalucian accent may at times cause a bit of a problem if you know Spanish a fair amount and watch this film without any subtitles. Try it, anyway it is well worth the effort. An excellent piece of drama which certainly deserves more recognition than it has got. Curiously both films end with a remarkably similar dedication at the end 'A mi madre; a todas las madres' - To my mother; To all mothers.

The initial themes deal not only with motherly concepts, but with desperation, alienation and loss of happiness caused by an anonymous world. The tale seems stark and slow at first, and you think, O Lordy, this is a bit bloody grim! But at some indifinable point, you're hooked! Solas is one of the most moving films I've seen. The acting, characterisation and dialogue (as far as I could tell from the subtitles) is priceless. Solas is quietly masterful, a rewarding work of passion.

Maria Galiana, as an elderly Spanish woman caught in the trap of a very bad marriage, but able to maintain her generosity and ability to love, is superb and inspiring.  Her grown daughter, played with passion by Ana Fernandez, is more sophisticated and bitter.  She has allowed herself to be used by a man, not unlike her unfeeling father, and her protrayal makes us sympathize with her, particularly when she finds she's pregnant and the man refuses to help her. And then there is the daughter's neighbor, played by Carlos Alvarez-Novia...a lonely old man with only his amazing dog for companionship.  How he and the mother establish a tender, but proper relationship is a piece of rare and subtle film-making.  I see no similarity between Zambrano's movie and the work of Mike Leigh (who apparently inspired him). Real people, yes, but the values demonstrated by Zambrano far surpass, in my estimation, those of Mike Leigh.  My highest recommendation to anyone interested in a film that has soul, without sentimentality or grossness.

Given over to LaLaLand, this would have been yet another throwaway melodrama drenched in its own soapiness. In Zambrano's hands, this low-budget gem eschews sentimentality and high-tech wizardry, digs deeply into characterization and shows us a view of the world we wouldn't know existed if we depended on Hollywood to show us. Zabrano's dialogue is just deadly accurate and very 'real'. The acting is uniformly superb, but Maria Galiana as the long-suffering, illiterate, sturdy Earth Mother is astonishing. She ambles on and off the screen with a weary, brilliant light. She has sacrificed her entire life in the service of a husband who doesn't deserve to lick her shoes. She does it because, well, that's the way it is for women of her generation.Carlos Alvarez-Novoa is equally brilliant as the the old neighbour who offers his considerable heart to the mother and to her pregnant-and-confused daughter Maria, beautifully played with passion and rage by Ana Fernandez.Both Galiana and Alvarez-Novoa give us faces and gestures of old and tired people who know too well the unfairness of life for the poor. There is a wonderful scene between the two when Alvarez-Novoa has an attack of diarrhea and Galiana insists on helping him. He resists, telling her he reeks of excrement. Galiana handles the situation as casually as she would the copious body wastes of the pigs she keeps back home in her native village. This tiny touch of humanity is the kind of scene one sees frequently in European films (and rarely, if ever, in flicks from Hollywood). Benito Zambrano has done a masterful job here. Like other politically conscious writers and directors working in Europe, he takes the reality of proletarian existence and makes it into something very real, all without sappiness. This is one terrific film.

Zambrano shows how difficult is to grow up in this outcast and bit farmer town with the leit-motiv of these three characters that join back together due to the father's illness. The father is marked rude and impolite, used to hit the wife or the daughter to show his total dominance and authority. The wife was totally subjected to this situation and the opportunity to find some understanding and heat with their neighbour is accepted with detachment by her.

Tenderly filmed, acted with understated and honest passion, and written in a way that makes you believe it. And that's the point. You really care about first the lonely old woman, then increasingly about her troubled daughter, and finally about the old man who is a neighbor living alone. What some people need, other people need to give. But they don't always know it, or if they know it they still resist, trapped by promises made or by convention.It's an interesting dose of reality that there are a couple of truly bad people here, as well, both men, both abusive in different ways to their woman. One, an older man in the hospital, remains bitter even as his health declines, and he reveals in a key passage that what he cares about is whether he was the kind of man society and tradition had expected him to be. Nothing else. It's sad, but not as tormenting as the younger selfish man who almost glories in his selfishness.What makes the movie strike deep, though, is how the women put up with this. We aren't sure if it is because they too are caught up in society's traditions, or if they have some emotional need to be abused, however that gets started. But what we are sure of is how familiar this sounds--if not in our own relationships, at least in those around us, somewhere.As powerful as this movie is, it is never overpowering, and never sentimentally driven (until, alas, the very end, which is a disappointing but understandable wrap up). What works so well is how subtle the emotional highs and lows are. It's all written and directed by people who understand what is going on in life, beyond the deceptions of the silver screen.

What happens is that all the professional movie critics will absolutely rave about a certain foreign movie, and my more intellectual friends will convince me to go see it with them.  Then, when I'm actually watching the film, it will turn out to be about physically unattractive middle-aged people smoking cigarettes and discussing abstractions.  After about twenty minutes of reading subtitles that could have been taken from a philosophy textbook, I fall asleep for the rest of the film.  This is not because I am an ugly American.  I spent my childhood in Canada, and I have the same reaction to Canadian films.  I just happen to think most foreign movies that make it to America (like most American movies that make it to America) are dull.  The reason I keep going to these films, however, is that occasionally there will be a pleasant surprise.  Life is Beautiful is a good example.  So is this film.This movie is about an old woman's first experience in the big city.  Her abusive husband has fallen ill and has had to go to the big city hospital for treatment.  The only other person in the city she knows is her daughter Maria.Maria is an overly-cynical alcoholic who hates her father.  She resents having to work as a cleaning lady and blames all her woes on being poor.  She lashes out in hostility to anyone who is kind to her and she thinks her mother's ideas about doing unto others is woefully naive.  Things get worse when she gets pregnant and her self-centered bully of a boyfriend refuses to take responsibility.The real center of the movie, however, is not Maria, but her mother and her relationship with the kindly old man who lives in Maria's building.  The old man lives alone with only a German shepherd named Achilles to keep him company.  The mother and the old man strike up a friendship, and the old man falls in love with her.  And when she visits her husband in the hospital, her husband sniffs her and tells her she stinks of other men.I found this movie extremely engaging and engrossing.  What I particularly liked was that although it didn't give in to Maria's cynicism, neither did it pull any punches as to the way the world really works.  I rooted for the mother to leave her husband for the old man, but I knew it would never happen (despite the fact that she admits that the old man is a better human being than her husband).  I wanted Maria's boyfriend (who isn't all bad) to be a good boyfriend and a good father, but I knew it wouldn't happen either.This film is touching without being schlocky.  It's heart-warming without being syrupy.  The film's only real flaws were at the very start and the very end.  At the start, I felt like I was just coming in at the middle since so much had apparently already happened that wasn't shown.  And I thought the film's last twenty minutes could have been cut to ten without losing their impact.My original stance on foreign films stays as is  they tend to be overrated by critics simply because they weren't made in a Hollywood movie factory.  But occasionally one comes along like Solas where the praise is justified.  9 out of 10.

It is basically the account of a few weeks in the lives of some personages, in the particular circumstance that the father of a family is in hospital and his wife has to move to the city to stay with him. No hint of sensitivity, or even humanity, is to be found in the ogre- like personage of the father, of whom we know through patches of conversation that is alcoholic (a vice inherited by his daughter), violent, family abuser and wasteful. To this father's attitude, the wife and the daughter adopt completely opposite attitudes; totally submissive the wife, whom might well have been depicted with an aura of holiness around her head; rebel and contemptuous towards her father the daughter, who hates him undisguisedly. Social groups are portrayed under fixed stereotypes too all affluent people are egoist, thoughtless towards others and bad; all poor people have a good heart, but life circumstances may make them behave not so honestly; all men are thoughtless, brute, women chasers, football lovers and sex-obsessed, but for one of the characters of the film, a neighbor which seems to share with the wife the gift of holiness; and all women are... well, they are a bit more fleshed out in the film and considered as individuals, rather than as a bulk indistinguishable from one another.I cannot recommend watching this film to anybody, but maybe for those whom may feel reassured in their convictions about human stereotypes in case they are coincident with those depicted in the film. Only one scene seemed to me of cinematographic value when the daughter is watching through a passing train a bag lady carrying her trolley; as the different carriages pass by we can see in very short flashes the increasing expression of sorrow, desperation and realization of the bag lady desperate condition. Ana Fernández is fine in her role as the daughter.

The centre of the film are its key characters, Rosa (María Galiana), her daughter María (Ana Fernández) and her neighbour (Carlos Álvarez-Nóvoa) and their struggle with loneliness. All three are broken people. Rosa and María's lives have been fractured by their abusive father. The neighbour's life is fractured by his very loneliness. As their interactions build, no matter how they try to avoid not being alone, a bond develops. Themes of motherhood, abuse, abortion and oldage are presented but never exaggerated or preached.The description sounds familiar but Zambrano gives it a unique treatment especially through his characters. María may not be much of a talker at work. She finds distraction in alcohol and sex and otherwise she lashes out. Rosa in contrast is quiet and mostly keeps to herself but she's a gentle person who is kind enough to offers help. The neighbour obviously enjoys Rosa's company in his otherwise lonesome life and he looks forward to their meetings.The sets and locations are simplistic but efficient. The cinematography and score are also used efficiently contributing to the flow rather than intruding. The dialogues too are simple but very well layered, especially in the way the actors deliver them. María Galiana is excellently restrained. Her silence has a strong voice and her minimal expressions convey plenty. Ana Fernández plays her part with equal conviction. She wonderfully highlights the differences between Rosa and María. Equally outstanding is Carlos Álvarez-Nóvoa as the lonely neighbour, the kind of man people often see as 'just an old man' and then forget about as he goes back to his lonely apartment.Lastly, Zambrano ends 'Solas' beautifully. I will not reveal this because the whole story leads up to it in a subtle and lyrical manner that the effect of it will be lost if I said a word more.

Although there are perhaps a dozen players it's essentially a three-hander, four if we stretch a point and include Paco De Osca's husband/father from hell who indirectly generates most of what happens with the other three, the other three being Maria (Ana Fernandez) a 35 year-old country girl long fled to the city as soon as she was old enough to escape her abusive drunken father and with little or no formal education is obliged to take a succession of menial cleaning jobs and provide a sex-object for macho Spanish males. As the story begins De Osca has just been admitted to hospital in the city and his down-trodden wife (Maria Galiana) has accompanied him and is reluctantly put up by Maria for the duration. The third member of this morose little group is widower Vecino (Carlos Alvarez-Novoa) who lives in the same apartment building as Maria and quickly attaches himself to her mother. For the mother it is a revelation to meet a man who is not only not an animal but also has finer feelings but she has become habituated to her role as doormat and when her husband is released from hospital she returns with him to their village leaving us with the impression that should her husband die she will return and take up with Vecino, who, in the wake of the mother's departure, persuades Maria not to abort the child she is carrying (the father has no interest in a permanent relationship and offers to underwrite an abortion) and promises to act as a grandfather.

Though it tends to rely on stock characters (wise, old yet lonely man, caring and efficient mother, wild-child daughter with a heart of gold), Solas retains a lot of it´s power through the well acted performances of all characters throughout.It is a film worth watching in conjunction with Pedro Almodóvar´s Todo Sobre Mi Madre, for its observation of women and their remarkable capacity to care despite the attitudes of some men, and the situations that they are placed in.  Indeed, the title does very well to explain the movie - Solas is best translated Alone, although the ending (-as) suggests it would be more accurately translated Women Alone.The action does tend to switch into the melodramatic, especially in the first half of the movie, and this may discourage those with little patience for such indulgences, but it is worth sticking through.  As a film to watch in order to improve your Spanish, it isn´t easy - but it gets easier to understand as the film moves along.Apparently, not a lot of Spaniards have seen this film, but those who have all agree on one thing - that it is muy fuerte, or very powerful, something they only seem to say about some films and most whiskies.  It is a title that is not undeserved. "},{"Title":"Sniffing dogs and fresh fish in Seville","Date":"9 August 2005","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Solas is a story that mirrors the lives a mother and her daughter María have as both have abusive relationships. When María's father is in hospital her mother stays with her daughter in Seville and meets a man (Vecino) of her own age in the apartment block. María's friend is only interested in the sexual part of their relation and immediately insists on having an abortion when he finds out she's pregnant. Mother and daughter now have to make important decisions about their future.The movie has a bleak and depressing atmosphere María has an alcohol addiction, she becomes jobless after working as a cleaning lady, hospital scenes with María's not too friendly father, Seville has never looked worse. Also most color schemes are rather dark, except for the halls in the apartment block and Vecino's apartment as it is there that consolation is found by both women. The theme of abusive relationships is nowadays hot in Spanish cinema with the recent (and more centered) Te doy mis ojos. The Andalusian dialect is well done here as many people learning to speak Spanish will have trouble understanding parts of the movie.Some symbolism is used in this movie Vecino's dog (loyalty but also guardian) is used to remind us of the disloyalty towards the father the mother experiences when she meets Vecino. María and her father sniffing on people, also demanding dog-like loyalty. Vecino's fish is fresh at first, but is later in the freezer, as is the possibility of a relationship between Vecino and the mother. And mind the name of our main protagonist María in relation to her story; her mother and father have no name in the movie; the mother played by María Galiana. The main message seems to be that nobody can be happy alone, although the irony is of course that all are alone (or lonely) because of one abusive relationship.Solas tells its story in a very slow pace, maybe to let us experience how slowly time flows for these unfortunate people. Its style is rather distant, so expect no cheap sentiment here. In the end the movie makes a time leap, but it feels as if that ending was rushed to leave the theater in a more uplifted mood. Also the ending feels contrived in a way. The same often happens with Mike Leigh's movies; take All or Nothing for instance, a movie and director where Solas has more in common with than meets the eye.The director Benito Zambrano has good storytelling skills, but lacks visual imagination when it comes to the medium of film. As he is also unable to structure the story in an interesting way, he is certainly no match for Pedro Almodóvar who has better visual skills and has learned how to structure a story. I guess Zambrano would be a far better writer than director. Solas is an interesting failure and one of the first Spanish movies in a long row I disliked somewhat. But that's also a little reassuring from the country that by now makes the most interesting movies in Europe. "},{"Title":"It's a good thing that I saw this movie when I did.","Date":"9 August 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I saw Solas (called Alone in English) at the 2000 Portland International Film Festival. It's always good to be able to see something non-Hollywood, especially considering the subject matter here. Maria (Ana Fernandez) comes from an abusive household and seeks to get away. When the father ends up in the hospital, Maria and the mother resist the idea of going to see him, but end up going anyway to see whether or not they can make amends with him.A major point is that the mother actually looks like someone who has been in an abusive relationship (in a Hollywood movie, she would probably look like Julia Roberts; or be played by her). It's a truly effective look at relationships and how they shape who we are. "},{"Title":"Skip the first 60 minutes","Date":"14 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This movie is about 3 relationships between the mother and her daughter, the mother and the neighbour, and resulting from the first two, the daughter and the neighbour. The first two aren't really that interesting, but the movie springs to light once the neighbour and the daughter start talking during a game of cards. What comes next are 30 minutes of excelent film-making which keeps you tied to your seat right through the ending. Too bad for the first (boring) hour though... In the end I gave it a 6/10.

Saw it on my laptop. I just adored this movie ...everyone in it and the way it was made. The first great thing about it was how totally simpathico I felt with the mum. The so unhollywood adorable mum. Everyone in the film reminded me of someone I know. To tell you the truth I was blubbering wreck by the end because there was so many resonances with my own life, with the relationship I have with my own daughter, with the way men behave in real life. I checked out the database for further films made by the director but there were none.???? I cant believe that after such a wonderful debut Benito Zambrano hasn't gone on to make it big in the film world. There is a gaping void out there waiting to be filled by directors of his calibre. Can I make plea for more movies in this genre please. Also on a very personal level it is a knitting movie and I am collecting them so it instantly goes into my top ten. "}]
