It stands apart from every gay-themed movie I've seen in that it's unsentimental, free of the feel-good sentiment almost every other gay movie is terrified to be without, and is a challenging piece of writing and film. It's the first gay movie I've seen that doesn't bend over backwards to excuse the fact that it's gay.This is a movie that is impossible to synopsize without giving away its biggest plot point, but suffice to say it's refreshing to see a movie that takes the depth and intellect of its gay characters for granted, and also assumes a decent level of intelligence of its audience. The movie contains complex characterizations and a challenging structure, exploring the dark side of human nature, especially the nature of those who have dealt with a number of additional issues revolving around being gay. This film begins a mile and a half past the starting point of other gay movies, who still seem stuck desperately trying to peddle a Gay is Okay agenda. The acting in this movie is also good, especially the main character, and the editing and cinematography keep the viewing experience tense and exciting.I did not enjoy watching this movie, the way one enjoys, say, Godzilla 2000. It's a harrowing and difficult film. But it's wonderful to see a movie like this coming out; one that is challenging and unsentimental, a real, thought-provoking work of film that happens to take gay men and their issues as its topic. It's a big step forward for gay film, and makes almost all other gay-themed films look as horribly amateurish, or just plain horrible, as they are.--- Check out website devoted to bad, cheesy and gay movies www.cinemademerde.com "},{"Title":"A unique film that demands multiple viewings","Date":"25 September 2000","Score":"33 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Finally! A gay-themed movie with some depth!  It is REALLY refreshing to see a movie about gay men that goes beyond their sexual orientation.  It seems that most gay-themed movies in recent years are just about teenagers coming out to their parents.  Although some of these films have been good (Edge of Seventeen for example), it is very nice to see a movie where the main character's sexuality is not the focal point of the film.  While homosexuality plays a substantial role in what Urbania is about, it is not the centerpiece of the story.  This film actually has a hauntingly resonant story, well-written and memorable characters, a terrific ensemble cast, and brilliant direction by Jon Shear in a directorial debut.I really loved how this film was directed in a non-linear fashion.  You only gradually learn why the main character, Charlie, (Dan Futterman in a great performance) is so troubled.  The climax of the film and the resolution are both heart-stopping and cathartic.  And there are many great scenes that lead up to this finale that are alternately hilarious and emotionally moving.One of the best of the year 2000.  I think I will see it again.

Like a moth to a flame he is drawn to Dean (Samuel Ball) &#150; but the question is will the flame consume him?The story is told in a disjointed series of flashbacks that means you must actually pay attention to the complex story.This is one film where the term `cinematic style' cannot be under used.  It is stylish, dark, atmospheric and intriguing from start to finish.  It is also hilariously funny at times.It was nominated for many awards and won most of them; including Best Actor for Dan Futterman at the Seattle International Film Festival. He is most well-known for his role in `Birdcage' as Calista Flockhart's boyfriend. He plays against type as the obsessed gay man determined to make this one night in his life count for something important.Every urban legend ever repeated is exhumed; and as Charlie says near the end of the film `We would be the stuff of legend.'Jordan Beswisck (Casting) and Director Jon Shear did an especially remarkable job with the supporting characters.  They slink in and out of Charlie's night like the creatures of the dark they are.  Particularly notable are Josh Hamilton as Matt the bartender, Lothaire Bluteau as the street person that has taken up residence on Charlie's door step, William Sage as Charlie's upstairs neighbor Chuck and his girl friend Clara brilliantly played by Barbara Sukowa.  What an amazing, yet disjointed, ensemble!The cinematography by Shane F. Kelly deserves special recognition it is dark, fast, enigmatic and always brilliant.The producers Stephanie Golden and J. Todd Harris also need to be acknowledged for their bravery and foresight in bringing such a difficult film to the screen.  They have the ability to see beyond the obvious to the golden moment that IS this film.This is not a film for everyone &#150; but if you possess intelligence, wit and character it is a film you must see.

I'll try to do so without revealing too much - don't want to ruin someone's initial viewing, but if I do this inadvertently, please forgive me- hence the SPOILER ALERT.Charlie is a gay man, coping with the death of his lover, Chris, killed before his eyes by thugs, with Charlie being restrained and prevented from helping. He carries the guilt with him that he could not protect his lover. He recognized a tattoo on the arm of the killer and suddenly remembers cruising him. He has (oddly enough) chosen not to reveal the man's identity to the police - he wants to take his vengeance on him personally. (You may ask why the gang left him alive if they knew he could identify them, but that's a plot point I cannot resolve).So begins a journey of a Ulysses in Nighttown as he seeks stories from the flotsam and jetsam of humanity he meets while searching for Dean, the identified killer- a hunk of a beast who delights in abusing women and gay men. The odd assortment of types he is thrown up against - or manages to avoid are a woman who seduces men, drugs them, and then cuts out one of their kidneys (a particularly gruesome and disturbing piece that opens the film); a woman who pays a bartender to expose himself, a homeless brain-damaged man, a friend who is dying of AIDS, a woman who places her wet poodle in a microwave to dry it (wrong move!), a straight couple he taunts at a bar, a bisexual tease he follows to a belligerent sexual encounter, etc.When he finally finds Dean, he begins a cat and mouse game, befriending the man while not revealing his gay identity, as he learns more and more about the hateful and abusive monster who killed his lover. Finally, he has him at his mercy, knife in hand, in an abandoned field.What makes this film so engrossing is the exceptional direction of Jon Shear, although the excessive violence left me quite queasy and disgusted, and the trio of exceptional performances - Dan Futterman (reminding me so much of Ben Gazzara), Samuel Ball, and Matt Keeslar.The romantic scenes between Futterman and Keeslar (in flashback and particularly in one set in a white heaven after life - a dream- a hallucination???) are amazingly palpable. You feel as if you are a voyeur allowed in to the most intimate of moments. How these actors achieved this connection is astonishing. Keeslar is strikingly handsome with a personality that is gentle and kind. He lets us FEEL Futterman's emotional pain at his loss by making us fall in love with him too. Ball is like an accident - incredible bone structure, containing a loathsome soul - you want to turn away, but you're fascinated to see if some part of him is redeemable. Lothaire Bluteau delivers an exceptional turn in a small role as a homeless man, Charlie befriends. Likewise, Alan Cumming is unforgettable in one scene. We wanted to see more of him. Christopher Bradley appears all too briefly in two scenes - barely a minute on screen.Futterman's emotional breakdown in the white room, confronting a lover who no longer exists, is so heartbreaking, you'll be in tears if you haven't gone there already.This is an incredibly powerful film - very hard to take - have the fast forward button handy during the violent scenes if need be. I can guarantee one thing- the images will stay with you - you'll never forget it.

Directed by first-timer Jon Shear with amazing surehandedness, Urbania tells the story of recently-singled Charlie, who has seemingly become disillusioned from society.  Shear's script, based on the play Urban Folk Tales, is a sharp and occasionally hilarious look at a gay man's search for redemption and love.  Obsessed with a man he's only seen on the street, Charlie wanders the streets, looking for love, and hoping to rekindle his past relationship.  It's a simple story, dealing with some hard issues in a non-linear way.Dan Futterman is heartbreaking in a very challenging role that requires him to gain our sympathy in spite of his problems.  On top of it all, however, is Shear, who handles this material with affection and heart.  His direction manages to be moody, atmospheric, suspenseful, and scary, all the while maintaining our sympathy for Charlie.  Thankfully, just as the film gets too serious for its own good, Shear throws in numerous asides to urban folk tales and reenacts them.  It's very funny, but in the end, it's as cathartic a film as you will see all year.  Do yourself a favor and catch this emotionally-haunting film but remember bring tissues.  You'll need 'em.

It's as if one were shadowing the lead character as he plays out the fate of a lonely and harrowing night, facing demons of circumstance as well as a few monsters he creates himself.Watching this film, I felt as if I was being forced to examine some disturbing sides of life when all I wanted to do was turn my head and look another direction.  Much like driving upon a tragic car accident, it's hard not to stare but, by the brute force of some macabre fascination that lives deep in the human psyche, one feels compelled to do just that.While Urbania is a tragedy, the content is handled with a sense of grace and humility.  During the final frames, one is left with a feeling of relief and healing, although tainted with the bitterness of loss.The direction, screenplay and style of Urbania is superb.

This movie was so fascinating I watched it twice in one weekend. I rarely do that, but this seems to demand multiple viewings. This is easily the best movie I've seen about urban legends. It utilizes a bleak urban setting to weave this popular folklore with the story of one man's night and the difficult time he has struggling to face his past and gain control of his life. Fantasy and reality are appropriately difficult to separate, just as it is with urban legends. The cinematography is excellent and innovative, the script is tight, the acting is perfect (Dan Futterman is outstanding as the lead), the character development is exceptional. This is quite brilliant, really. Like a David Lynch film, every second, every sound, every word, every image tells you something important. Finally, this is a film that (going along splendidly with the urban legend theme) questions assumptions some groups of of people have about the other (and vice versa). My Rating 9/10.

Dan Futterman is just superb in his role...this had to have been a difficult part to play but he pulls it off. Actually no one is bad but Matt Keeslar (as his lover Chris) and Samuel Bell (as Dean) deserve special mention.This film is not for everybody. It challenges you and makes you think (how many films nowadays do that?) and is very dark, disturbing and depressing. It also demands multiple viewings (I had to see it twice to actually understand it). Also there is some violence that is jarring. But, at the end, I was in tears--I've seen this movie at least seven times and I STILL cry at the ending. It's actually a happy ending (sort of) but really hits hard.Basically this film deals with love, loss and coming to terms with it. Also there are urban legends played out during the film--they DO fit in. It deals with gay relationships primarily and there's plenty of kissing and flashes of nudity.

The first time I sat down to watch this movie, it was late at night and I thought it seemed sort of wierd.  The first scene made me a bit squeemish, it didn't seem like what I was expecting, and I was being interrupted by phone calls anyway, and couldn't really give it my full attention, etc. so I thought, well, I'll put that one aside for now and think about whether I really want to watch it. Finally, one evening I was rummaging around for something to watch and I saw this lying there and said, OK, I'll give it another try.  I am so glad that I did.  As I let it play on from the beginning I found myself totally engrossed.  Turns out it's very fast moving and you have to be on the ball to get everything out of the movie.  The ending moved me to tears.  This is a thriller with a dark thread of ironic comedy woven into a very serious and moving story.  I love the writer's and director's use of urban legends. I think the film clearly illustrates how there really are injustices in this life, (ie the story of the main characters), but how many horrible injustices in society get overlooked and dismissed as trivial, through the desensitization of being grouped together and schluffed off as 'just another one of those urban legends...it didn't happen in my back yard so it must never really happen...etc.'?  But, as Charlie's character points out, s**t really does happen.  The truth is that these types of injustices happen often (whether to straights, gays, lesbians, people of color, homeless, handicapped, etc.) but it's always easy to overlook and dismiss as non-existant injustices that have never happened to you or anyone you know. No amount of denial can negate fact.  No amount of mass ignorance can void truth.  This film is not a good 1st or 2nd date movie and not a good choice for the person who has no depth of character, intellect or emotion.  But if you are someone who has the ability to think deeply and see further than the end of your nose, and enjoy reflecting on a film after you see it, you will not be disappointed.

If i could, id award ALL of those in this film. The depth, power and heat of Urbania are its real stunning feats. It plays as a hetero-flick, (at the beginning, i thought Charlie was straight,) and engulfs us in heart-warming and loving flash-backs. But towards the climax, the film reveals its true colors. Gay characters have never been played with such villanous or sinister-esque qualities. It is a slap in the face for those who think the homosexual community is weak and sissified. Futterman's brilliance for villany upheld the main idea and the motive behind Charlie's actions. I was shaken when the movie was over, shaken in a good way. If this movie had gone through mainstream release,(which it should have,) homosexuals would be seen in another light.

It also gives one the chance to see a beautiful and complex performance by Dan Futterman.But there is one scene with Futterman and Alan Cummings which shines like a tiny diamond in the center of Urbania. While the scene fits neatly and contributes to the flow of the story, it is so well written and acted that it feels to me almost like a separate entity.

Futterman is terrific as a man torn apart by grief, seeking closure through his pursuit of a rough stranger (Ball), though the reason for his odd behavior is kept back from the audience until the climax, when quarry and prey are brought together by a series of dramatic revelations. The gorgeous Matt Keeslar (SPLENDOR) plays Futterman's boyfriend with loving grace - their scenes together are warm, tender and more than a little sexy - and Shear makes the most of a fine supporting cast, including Alan Cumming (as a former party animal, now dying from an AIDS-related illness), Lothaire Bluteau (JESUS OF MONTREAL), Josh Hamilton (ALIVE), Paige Turco (TV's The Agency) and Christopher Bradley (hunky co-star of David DeCoteau's LEATHER JACKET LOVE STORY).

I'm not sure that Urbania completely avoids this, though it wins points for its indirection.The final scenes in his former lover Chris' apartment seemed like eerily prescient outtakes from today's _Dead Like Me_ or _Six Feet Under_, and the symbolism was surprisingly unsubtle.  And I would swear that that Chris' tufted off-white Mies Van Der Rohe chaise-longue was featured in this week's NYTimes.Finally, maybe it's deliberate or just me, but I thought that both his former lover and the neighbor upstairs looked exactly like tidied-up versions of the street thug and were all played by the same actor.

He sees a singer, singing and dancing.  He sees his lover, and all of his friends.  And at the corner of the party, he sees himself, having a great time.  Then he comes back into reality and walks into the comfort of his buddy. I had a great fascination of this scene.  Maybe it is because I saw this movie after the death of my greatest summer and related to the character's yearning for the better times.  I watched this while still in that early school year nostalgia, constantly thinking about those great parties that seemed so long ago.  Whatever it was, this scene instantly rang true for me. The character's ascending into the great past was shown in a way I had never seen in a movie before.  It is an honest and original way of showing how one in mourning thinks. Although he is looking back to great memories in a sad nostalgia.his loss had more to come.  His lover had been brutally murdered in front of his eyes some time after the party.  This sets him adrift into a sad routine of leaving messages on his machine, hoping he will pick up, and waiting at a bar.hoping someone he saw on the street one day, who captivated him, will walk in. One important trait about the hero is that he is a homosexual.  He is prey to a New York City jungle of hate, and flashes back to letting go of his lover's hand after seeing gay-bashers.  This frightens him, and saddens him even more when the one he waits for turns out to be one of those kind of punks. This is a rare film that fills you with an intense uncertainty until a mind-blowing conclusion.  Many will be turned off by what seems like an aimless tale.but stick through this one for an ending that redeems any negative feelings about it, for the most part. I still do have just one negative feeling about the movie, however, and the reason the ending didn't erase it is because there is an almost unrelated opening scene.  The movie contains a lot of storytelling from different characters, but one in particular involves a woman who isn't who she seems. The screenwriters felt the need to open the film with this, which it does have some relevance with the story, but I thought it branched away from the main focus of the film.which is the mourning protagonist.

Dan Futterman is wonderful as the central character, who happens to be gay.  Just who he is looking for isn't immediately clear, but his search forces him to wade through a sea of urban legends, most of which are re-enacted around him on his journey.  Near journey's end, the tangled plot (helped by non-linear editing) becomes a bit clearer to the viewer and the story culminates with it's biggest twist of all.  (BTW, if you hated the ending of Broadway's ill-fated musical STEEL PIER or a certain mega-hit suspense flick of a couple of years ago - steer clear of URBANIA.)  Although Dan Futterman and those he encounters are fascinating, I'm not sure I fully understand how urban legends fit in - other than to provide a few tingles and giggles along the way.

Mainly, it is serious, adult film with gay characters. These characters are complex and not always sympathetic; they seem real. While several of the actors are above average in the looks department, their roles are not happier for it. None of the usual cliches of gay-themed films are present. There is no drag queen with a heart of gold to fix everybody's problems. There are no incongruous, campy musical numbers. This film deals with emotional lives that, at bottom, have, in fact, little to do with homosexuality. The traumatic event--gradually revealed--experienced by Charlie is something to which anyone should be able to relate.At the center of Urbania is a finely-tuned performance by Dan Futterman. This very appealing actor has demonstrated his abilities in TV work, but here displays a range that seems unlimited in its emotional spectrum. The supporting players are high-caliber as well. Matt Keeslar has never been better, nor has Alan Cumming. In truth, there are no weak links in the cast.Intelligently written, brilliantly filmed and edited, Urbania also features a striking soundtrack by Marc Anthony Thompson, with an unconventional use of source music (Mingus, for example, in a bar scene).Urbania should be seen by anyone interested in current film. Not only in a year of mostly mediocre fare, but because of the depth and power of its cathartic resolution.

Director John Shear is to be applauded, as are so many of the supporting cast members. Dan Futterman's performance, however, is nothing short of superb. His character's range of emotions could easily be overplayed; Mr. Futterman's delivery is so dead-on that one easily gets lost in his character - we become him - even if we don't fully understand him.

It is written by Daniel Reitz, who also wrote the original play. He does a superb job bringing this sordid tale to the screen.Filmed almost entirely in New York, Shear manages to set the mood from the very beginning with dark shots in dark streets, making the mood mysterious. You're not quite sure what is happening at first, but it begins to unravel along the way and builds to an exciting and brilliant ending, which I won't divulge. See the movie.Dan Futterman is totally committed to this role and film. You can tell by his amazing and realistic performance, as a young gay man who is searching for answers. This is a far better suited role for him than the wimpish son in THE BIRDCAGE. I liked his choices as an actor and his freedom in working the nude scenes with other guys. You believed him. Along with Futterman, look for excellent performances by Lothaire Bluteau as a homeless man, Josh Hamilton as the bartender in a gay bar, Matt Keesler, as a young gay man living with AIDS, Samuel Ball, as the guy being sought (it's an unsympathetic role, and this guy manages to bring some depth to it) and Alan Cumming as Futterman's lover.

He wanders around, seemingly in a daze most of the time, but eventually we understand that this is going to turn into a revenge story where he seeks out the man who humiliated him and his gay lover.Unfortunately, Futterman's character remains ambiguous throughout. At one moment, he's sympathetic and helps a beggar on the street--and the next moment he's completely heartless in the way he treats a street pick-up gone wrong or a young couple he attaches himself to for the mere sport of abusing them with the truth about their being his upstairs neighbors who are not discreet in their lovemaking.He's such a complex person, but the script doesn't explain why he behaves as he does. At least the unpredictablility of the story is not a drawback--in fact, it helps sustain interest since the viewer doesn't have a clue as to what will happen next. It's a nice build-up of suspense that keeps the drama edgy until the final shot.All the performances are beyond reproach, so it's not the actors who are to blame for whatever shortcomings the story has. But some scenes are awkwardly staged, others deeply impressive--so it's an uneven mix of good and bad moments and sometimes guilty of style over substance.It won awards from some of the gay film societies but seems to have made not much of an impression at all on mainstream moviegoers with its homoerotic content, despite the fact that one of its characters mouths off some homophobic comments and gets his comeuppance in the end in what is basically a tale of revenge, gay style.

Not perfect, but entertaining, sexy, visually interesting, and memorable.My main comment is that sometimes, movies are not meant to appeal to all audiences. As a gay man, this movie touched on one of my greatest fears -- losing my partner to a basher, or being bashed myself. This fear is specific to gay men; although women can relate on some level, and other minority groups can relate on other levels, this movie did a great job of exploring bashing from a gay male perspective. I think it would be quite difficult for a, say, straight male to appreciate this film on a gut level, like I did. It had a lot to do with my life as a gay man, and I always appreciate that, because it's not all that common. I had a similar reaction to THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, which dealt with issues of aging and property and class and inter-generational relations (non-sexual, that is) for gay men - again, rather rare topics for film.I don't mean to say that only gay men can enjoy this film, or that it should be held to different standards, just that as the film's intended audience, I really enjoyed the story, the topic, and the film's execution. And I appreciate the rare pleasure of seeing specific feelings and situations from my life being explored on screen in an intelligent way.

The term is one used by many gay men to describe a person who commits violence against gay men.I went in to this film without knowing too much about it beyond the fact that it was about gay men.  But within just a few minutes of the opening, I understood what the situation was, despite the fancy cutting and nonlinear development of the plot.All came together for me at the end of the film, and I think Urbania is a solid, decent film dealing with a gay man coming to terms with the violence that often besets gays, particularly gays in urban environments, today.  I found it--finally--a very emotionally moving film.But the film taxed my patience along the way to its conclusion.  At first, it impressed me as just a lot of fancy cutting and unnecessarily complicated fracturing of time.  Then, it seemed as if the film was going to be just another of the sort that shows us the world through the eyes and mind of a crazy person, in this case Charlie, crazed by his grief and anger.  Next, it seemed to develop into a Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry type of film, in which Charlie was going to act out a revenge fantasy that many gay men might have--about killing a fag basher.  Obviously, the filmmaker was trying to replicate the state of Charlie's mind as we are shown flashbacks to the party scene, to the fag-bashing scene, and to other scenes between Chris and Charlie.Interwoven with Chris and Charlie's story are several urban legends.  Did this have a lot to do with the plot?  I don't think so.  At one point, Charlie said something to the effect that he and Chris may become part of an urban legend.  I assume Charlie was referring to the possibility that he would kill Dean and would become known as the gay man who extracted revenge on a fag basher.I'd never seen Dan Futterman before.  He was fine for Charlie, but I imagine he was cast because he bears a strong resemblance to Griffin Dunne, who calls up After Hours, which presents a parallel New York world to the one shown here.Samuel Ball who plays Dean, the fag basher, bears a startling resemblance to Robert Rikas, the lead actor in the classic 1972 gay porno film, Left Handed, directed by Jack Deveau and Jaap Renraat.  Rikas, like the character Dean here, also had a large tattoo (but of an eagle rather than a snake) on his bicep.  I've seen no references to Urbania invoking Left Handed, so I assume this is a connection that I'm making only because I'm familiar with Left Handed.There is much in this film for sophomores of all ages to pour over.  (And I was being a sophomore in the paragraph above.)  Some of the symbolism is obvious, and another IMDb commentator, Matthew Ignoffo, has explained some of it, so check out his notes.  Then there are those viewers who are busy speculating that much of the film is simply Charlie's fantasy, that perhaps Chris just left Charlie, that he was not murdered, and so on.  Yawn.  This is more than I care to consider with regard to this film.There is a large plot hole in this film (at least for me) If Dean had slit Chris's throat, causing his death, as shown here, this would have been front-page news in the NY papers.  There would have been a major manhunt for Chris's killer.  Thus, it's unlikely that Dean would have been hanging around the Village for Charlie to discover.  The film attempts to deal with this plot hole in one scene where Charlie looks up at a street lamppost and notices there an old poster advertising a reward for information leading to the apprehension of Chris's killer.  So, perhaps there was a search for the killer, but the film doesn't waste time on these details.  And, indeed, if Dean had been hanging around the Village and Charlie saw him, wouldn't Charlie have phoned the police?  No, you'll say; Charlie wanted to extract his private revenge.  Well, maybe so.For me, the highlight of the cast was Matt Keeslar, who, I think, is quite a hot number even since I first saw him in Last Days of Disco.  I just saw Keeslar a few weeks ago as Nils, the Swedish nerd, in Psycho Beach Party, a completely different role from what he plays here.  Matt's been hitting the gym and is in top physical form here.  He plays almost all of his scenes either naked in bed with Charlie or in his underwear.  He never shows the full Monty, but his underwear scenes make it appear there's a nice Monty there.  (Sorry, I don't mean to offend straight readers!)Playing a bartender here is Josh Hamilton.  I think of Josh as a Tony Perkins look-alike ever since I saw him in The House of Yes.  Here he has his hair brushed down over his forehead in bangs and doesn't look so much like Perkins.  He's also involved in an urban legend about a woman desperate to see his full Monty and how this worked to his advantage.Bill Sage, who plays Chuck, Charlie's upstairs neighbor, is attractive in a Ken Doll sort of way.This film has been highly acclaimed by critics.  I think it's been overpraised.  It isn't a masterpiece, though it is a solid piece of work, worth your time and admission price. "},{"Title":"Wow!

A quilt that may represent the craziness of life as well as being a stand-in for the AIDS quilt. A bar named Karma. A broken clock on the night when we gain a full extra hour of darkness. These and other symbols bring us along on a journey with the main character as he refuses to accept a painful loss. He is haunted, and may even be in love with death because of his loss.The film has laughter, horror, tears -- all presented with an unnerving, subdued power that left me stunned for a long time after watching it. This is a modern Dark Night of the Soul. I was reminded of the quote from Isaiah I gave my back to those who beat me. I was also reminded of a New Testament quote about giving the shirt off your back.The three principal characters, Charlie, Dean, and Chris (Dan Futterman, Samuel Ball, and Matt Kesslar), are the most unconventional and unlikely Christ-figures I have come across in movies -- and believe me, I've seen a lot of them!Ultimately, through the main character's dark journey, the audience learns that hatred can be transformed into a loving sense of humanity and that it takes courage not to respond to hate with hate.The film deserves all the rave reviews it has received. If my comments here seem confusing, it's because this is a movie that can't be discussed easily or simply. See it for yourself!

Anchored by Dan Futterman's outstanding performance, the 1500+ edits spin us between backstory, present story, reality and fantasy, confusing the audience only as much as Charlie (Futterman) himself is confused. When I left the theatre, I needed an hour to absorb what I'd just watched. I think people who have dealt with violence close to them will have the strongest reactions to Urbania.In some ways, this is a very New York film -- I saw it with a bunch of Toronto-based critics, and many of the lighter moments completely went over their heads. And there are light moments, which makes the next emotional wist of the knife even sharper.My only complaint -- and I guess this is a slight spoiler -- is that for a mid-size budget, I would have expected higher quality blood. 16mm captures colour and contrast incredibly well, and the blood just looked like red paint.Anything else I could say would be a spoiler. If you like getting inside the brains of characters, go see this.

Dan Futterman gives a remarkable performance in the role of Charlie, a wounded, angry insomniac who meanders through the night searching for the man who will make everything right.The story is told through a sequence of non-chronological glimpses of Charlie's present journey as well as his memory.  It is like seeing something blurry in the distance that comes into focus as time passes.  At the end, we know the whole story with striking clarity, and understand Charlie's complex network of motive and action.  This gradual unfolding of the story gives the film a mysterious quality and a constant sense of discovery.  Shear creates a remarkable sense of rhythm by masterfully juxtaposing scenes of brutal violence next to visions of sheer compassion.  The narrative is also punctuated with funny reenactments of urban legends which lend comic relief as well as a sense of familiarity.  I found these scenes to be very effective, but could see how one could find them superfluous.The film has also received praise for the technical innovations involved in its making.  I am very impressed that  the film is at the cutting edge of cinematic technology, but is not about technology.  Instead, the technology works seamlessly at the service of a very well told tale.All in all, Urbania is an truly satisfying, genuinely moving film.  It is a glorious triumph for John Shear as his first film.

It is smart, funny, thrilling and ultimately moving.  It is so much than a gay film and to call it one denies the power that it has to so much about the human condition.  Let me say right off the bat that Dan Futterman gives an amazing, powerful performance and all of the accolades that have been heaped upon him are well deserved. I also want to add that the rest of the performances are also first rate.  Also, I got to see the DVD version of the film and it is amazing. It is chock full of really great extras such as a really smart commentary from the director and several of the actors. It also has some great features (including one with Jan Brunvand an expert on Urban Legends - I have his books!!) and it sounds great.  This is one movie that didn't get a wide release last year (although it deserved it from all of the great reviews that I have seen) but this is a great chance to see the film.

They seemed to have such strength in their performances and the bonds in their characters worked so well! The romance between the 2 guys was so convincingly and beautifully played that you would have a heart of stone not to melt whilst watching it and Alan Cummming as the still mourning friend was a perfect addition.I cannot recommend this film enough....Its not easy to watch; in terms of how its put together but once you get through the initial change of style from your normal film then you will be glad you kept with it.........

No such luck. The adulation heaped on this film by the previous reviews on this website are a mystery to me. It just goes to show that if a work is pretentious, dreary, and boring enough, it will probably be hailed as a work of art. We all know what P.T.

It's a very dark and depressing film, which uses the seedy part of gay life as its canvas to draw us into a web of utter confusion. A simple interpretation suggests that the filmmakers want to strike back at the gay bashers of the world, something gay people are not usually thought capable of doing--that is, defending themselves physically from the abuse of a small percentage of scumbags that frequent the straight world. But there's probably much more involved that meets the eye here, thus making it a worthwhile movie, one that viewers can see several times the hallmark of important art forms.

It takes 1/3 of the film to discover that you care what is happening to these characters and find out that a finely acted and written film is unfolding before you. Flashbacks and imagination works well in places and a solid performance is turned n by Dan Futterman, although the whole characterization is not quite carried out as far as it could have been if the time were spent on this instead of gimmickry.

Being up on my films and what is released, it caught my interest since I'd never recalled hearing about it.I watched it. Painful. Pretty much from the get-go. The primary thing that makes any film painful to sit through, whether it's a realist or surrealist drama, is the absence of anything that would resemble truthfulness (truthfulness in behavior, truthfulness in dialogue, etc.) A filmmaker can make the most bizarre, esoteric film ever, provided there's some kind of human truth in it. If there is, the audience will be drawn in. I could not find it here. It is reminiscent of another film dealing with the seamier side of the gay nightlife scene of NYC's Village, 1980's Cruising, but at least that film had Pacino to liven it up, and more skilled direction by Exorcist & French Connection director, William Friedkin.This film is painfully vague and obtuse, making a David Lynch film seem like Sesame Street, and the dialogue is written in a way that is hard to imagine that anyone actually speaks. The actors struggle through a sub-par script, however the script may not appear so sub-par if it had better direction. But there is obvious miscasting, including the bartender and the homeless man. I've never encountered a NY bartender quite that timid or blundering, or a homeless guy that could've just as easily been cast in a Wendy's commercial (of course, he also has to stutter and be mentally challenged, though that is far from representative of a true NY homeless person). I would say if you're going to make something up, that doesn't reflect the reality of time & place, make it more interesting.I did notice that Alan Cumming was in the movie, so I waited for his (albeit brief) appearance, to see what a truly talented actor could do with a bad script. Though his scene was one of the few that was not badly written, it was still pleasantly surprising to see what a fine job he did with it. His behavior was completely believable and made for one of the few bright spots in the film.However, even though there's a painful pretentiousness to this film, (and very little honesty), I was quite surprised when I checked out rottentomatoes.com that it had gained some decent reviews, especially from Stephen Holden in the NY Times. He must've seen something I clearly missed.

The bartender getting paid a couple hundred buck to expose himself to a woman, and then inheriting a a large insurance payment when she dies in an airplane crash - OK, we're starting to stretch things a little. But, the introduction of the Urban Legends stuff. C'mon - that's clearly brought in to try to camouflage the main plot & attract a wider audience, and an excuse to name the movie something sexier than The Gay Bashing Avenger.

In a typical studio marketing ploy, the film is advertised as a sexy thriller with no mention of the fact that it is a gay movie. Most renters will feel mislead, and to imply that Urbania will be enjoyed by both gay and straight audiences is delusional. If the film-makers had truly meant the film for mass appeal, they would have downplayed the sex scenes (which will automatically repulse a large percentage of straight audiences), and spent more effort developing the characters and story line. I thought the premise of the film was quite good A man loses his lover through violence. Loneliness and guilt drive him to the edge of sanity in his search for justice. If done correctly, it could have been an outstanding film, but the director chose, instead, to depend on vague flashbacks, in-your-face gay sex scenes, urban myths that have nothing to do with the plot, and ill defined supporting characters. All the hetero males are mindless thugs. The women are all portrayed as stereotypes, none believable, and only the gay males are handled with anything resembling sympathy. It's okay if the film-makers chose to target a specific market, but let's not confuse Urbania with anything other than a marginal genre film.  A masterpiece by no means.
