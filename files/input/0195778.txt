[{"Title":"Not great, but not a bad movie that so many say it is.","Date":"11 June 2002","Score":"27 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  OK, it was my weekly free rental, so it didn't have to be great. But I cannot understand all the highly negative criticism of Here on Earth. It has a very true theme, everyone deserves to find true love before they die. However, it plays more like a made-for-TV teen romance than a theater blockbuster. But it is better than many of the teem movies made recently.Sam (Leelee Sobieski) is a small town girl whose big plans to go to UM on a track scholarship got waylayed by a knee injury. She has a boyfriend Jas (Josh Hartnett) that she has known forever, he loves her (I know you better than anyone, Sam.), but we can see there isn't the passion one expects of true love.Along comes Kelley (Chris Klein), the smart (valedictorian) rich kid who is stuck on himself, the last person Sam's sister and parents want her to get mixed up with. But there is a spark of passion there, Sam starts to feel for the first time she might find true love. You see, she has a secret. The knee injury has affected her liver and she is on a fast path to death.Kelley and Jas are like two elk competing for the one fertile female at springtime. Verbal and physical challenges, an ill-advised car chase results in a crash into gas pumps and burning down the local hangout. Both of their sentences require them to work all summer to rebuild the restaurant. Kelley stays in the garage apt.When the summer is over, the restaurant rebuilt, Sam has been laid, Jas is no longer Sam's girlfriend, Kelley just boards the bus and leaves without visiting the dying Sam. He has things to attend to, a life to get on with. However, back at home he has second thoughts, sees yellow roses planted by his deceased mum, and goes back to be with Sam. At her funeral, he reads from poetry they both enjoyed. She found true love before she died, he learned about what is really important.The story is not novel, but it still is a pretty good one. Josh Hartnett is excellent as the unpolished bumpkin, Leelee as the philosophical girl looking for meaning in her short life. But Chris Klein looks out of his league. He still has a way to go before he can graduate from his teen gross-out roles in films like American Pie.I never felt totally immersed in the film, because some of the acting and some of the dialog didn't quite ring true. However I found it to be a pleasant 90 minutes and it probably deserves a rating somewhere around 5 to 7, which is where the IMDb votes cluster presently.  To rate it a 1 as so many have, or to call it possibly the worst movie of all time are just absurd.The DVD was fine, with Dolby 5.1 sound, but the extras consist primarily of several trailers for other films put out by this company.

There is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the Rich boy and Poor boy wind up having to do Community Service as ordered by the town judge. Rich boy and Poor boy just do not get along and the Rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend. There are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. Poor Girl says, Some people go through life and never find Love, I can say that I found love and am holding on to It. You will need some tissue's if you are sensitive, there are plenty of romantic scenes and I doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end. The producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film. If you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your film.

Still, I must insist, for the common good, that you never write another screenplay as long as you live. Put down the pen, step away from the laptop! If you refuse to heed the pleading of wounded brains, I have watched a movie or two in my life, and I believe you will find my counsel helpful 1. Do not include love scenes in which overwrought teenage boys name the body parts of their girlfriends after US states. If you must pen such a scene, please do not name the breasts New York and New Jersey; it causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples. Also, it is almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying.2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes movies in order to reinforce class distinctions.3. Do not bludgeon the audience over the head with exhausted clich√©s. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain, and it cleanses them of their cares. We get it. Yes, the roses continue to bloom in Kelley's dead mother's greenhouse, even though every other plant has begun to rot. It Is A Symbol Of Their Love. It is also very painful when applied via blunt-force trauma to the backs of our heads. For the love of God, Mr. Seitzman, we get it. We all get it, all across the land. Amish people, the hard of hearing, unborn babies - we all get it.4. Do not require the actors to perform mime sequences. Ever. No, never.5.

There were so many problems with both the story and the actors that it's unbelievable that someome actually gave the go-ahead to release it. For starters, the story is lame. It is a movie based entirely on a love triangle with three unlikable characters; consequently, no one cares who ends up with who. This story moves at a snail's pace, at some points almost impossible to watch. The audience is supposed to identify with Samantha, a small town waitress who is bored with her life and her nice-but-not-so-bright boyfriend, Jasper. I can understand that. However, it's impossible to feel sorry for this girl, or understand her actions, because of the way she shamelessly chases after the rich spoiled jerk, Kelly, who looked down on her, her boyfriend, her family, and her town because they were poorer, AND the horrendous way she treats her longtime boyfriend. She runs around with Kelly, making out with him in public, right in front of Jasper's best friend, all without having the decency to tell Jasper she's cheating on him, then callously dumps him, telling him flat out she'd rather be with his enemy, then leaves him to for all she knows commit suicide or beg in the streets or whatever, because if she doesn't hurry, Kelly will leave without her. So Kelly and Sam both prove to be selfish and uncaring of who they hurt. Jasper is the only mildly likeable character, but even he is hard to watch, drooling after undeserving Sam is as bad as Sam drooling over undeserving Kelly. And by the time the climax comes, Sam is so unlikeable you just really don't care what happens to her.Finally, this weak plot may have worked(not likely, but possibly) if they had chosen some different actors. Leelee is a talented actress- in supporting roles. She has neither the charisma nor talent to carry a movie- especially a weak plot like this one. And Chris Klein (Kelly) does a great job with comedy, but he lacks the talent to make Kelly anything more than a one dimensional shallow rich guy. Josh Hartnett did okay, but wasn't given very much to go on. Jasper also comes across very one dimensional.The producers/directors/whoever was in charge clearly did not read the script, but was just counting on the casting of 2 popular heartthrobs and the soundtrack by teen idol Jessica Simpson to make this movie a success for the 12-18 female demographic. Let's hope that's what they were shooting for; if they were trying to do anything else they failed miserably.

I'll stick with the main points which plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer.Scene One Chris Klein, after having been thrown out of prep school (because he looks like a seventeen year old--yes, very believable), gives what I assume is his valedictorian speech...to a field. Let me repeat that for you--a field. I think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence he is failing to express. Klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. He is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but little more.Scene Two After some joyriding and teenage pyromaniac hijinks, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett do some damage to the local diner, of which he is forced to rebuild. Of course. Because who better to help with construction than some random moron who crashed into it/ burned it in the first place. Better yet, let's have said random moron move in on Josh Hartnett's girl, Miss Sobeski, the girl he fancies for...her equally wooden line delivery? Scene Three Chris Klein's character is making out with Leelee Sobeski's character and decides to name her various body parts after the states on the eastern seaboard. My soul weeps. Really, how can this scenario turn out well? Surely you must alienate several million people if you imply their home is equivalent to Miss Sobeski's more...erm...feminine areas. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey prompts some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is actually freakishly disproportionate.Scene Four Leelee is running. She falls down. This gives her...knee cancer. We always knew it could come back, her father(?) says. Right. Knee cancer. From tripping. Perhaps I missed something. As I said, it's been a few years. Surely I missed something. Didn't I? For the love of God, please tell me the girl did not contract KNEE cancer from falling down. That scream you just heard was my soul dying.

Its not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and at times feels a little sub-human.  The principals act like they are other-worldly, in the worse way, when they are supposed to be relating to each other and the audience. Starts out conventionally enough.  Rich kid gets new car for graduation but the dean says he can't have the car until after the ceremony.  Goes joy-riding nonetheless, and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels.  Wise-asses the waitress/girlfriend of the head yokel. Shockingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner they left three minutes earlier (aren't all diners five feet from the gas station?).They told they have to Pay The Price in court, so the only reason to get this 'fish out of water' to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to assist in the rebuilding of the diner. Worse than that, the rich kid in staying with the family of the un-rich kid..in the room above the attic.  That 'room above the attic' has rescued many a person in need of a bed..Rich kid inexplicably is treated well by the girlfriend, who never mentions to him that he nearly killed her.  This does not bode well, of course, with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained.  You don't know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls for Kelley (Chris Klein), or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it.  Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee completely intolerable, and Josh does not register much of an impression.  The character with the most life is the judge that sentences Kelley and Jasper to help re-build the diner.  She gets off at least one funny remark, which is more than anyone else does.  Everyone is so morose and humorless that you will feel a little sill if you even think of smiling while the movie is on. The ending is one way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over.  I don't enjoy trashing a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world might really love, but since I am not one, I have to.  The nicest thing I can say about this movie is that its not mean-spirited, and although it fails to compel, its innocence and home-spun, corny dialogue comes from a nice place.  4/10.

The story begins with a rivalry between a group of prep school boys and local townies that have a reckless car race that ends up burning down a local diner and gas station.  The judge sentences the two drivers to a summer of community service rebuilding the diner.  Kelley (Chris Klein) is a spoiled rich boy with attitude.  Jasper (Josh Hartnett) is a local hick with a good heart and a bad temper.  Needless to say, the two boys hate each other.  To complicate matters, Jasper's girlfriend Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) is developing a serious case of the hots for Kelley.  They begin an affair complete with dewy looks, running through fields, stolen glances and every other schmaltzy film technique ever invented.The prep/townie rivalry escalates into a love triangle with all the foreseeable showdowns and confrontations.  Just when everyone is working themselves into a good lather it is discovered that Samantha is seriously ill.  Pass the Kleenex.The film has some very sweet moments but the story is far too formulaic and predictable.  It has the feel of a TV movie, which is not surprising since director Mark Piznarski has mostly TV projects on his resume.  To his credit, the cinematography was beautiful and his choice of locations was superb.  The overlook scenes were particularly lovely.Chris Klein gave an adequate performance, but was not very dynamic and a little stiff.  I felt that he was much better in `American Pie' playing a more sincere character.  He seems like too nice a guy to play this spoiled and arrogant rich kid.  Leelee Sobieski was a good choice for Samantha.  She comes across as very vulnerable and sweet.  She was adept at capturing the delicate teenage balance between tentativeness and determination.  I actually liked Josh Hartnett better than I did Klein.  Perhaps he was better suited for his character, but he seemed a lot more believable as Jasper.This is a great chick flick.  It is sentimental, romantic, endearing and sad.  Guys are likely to spend most of the movie writhing in their seats.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very original and suffered from too many clich√©s.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add one or two points if you like sentimental romances and another if you like a movie that makes you cry.  A good film for girls' night out.

Here are some of the things we pointed out we don't care for Leelee Sobieski's character, whatever happens to her, she is a two-timing bitch.

I could go on forever, but I think the word stupid really sums up this movie. While not only being highly unrealistic, this movie is boring and heartless, while what the goal obviously was to make the audience really be enthralled and the film be totally emotional. No, the crew has not reached their goal. This has turned out to be a cheese-ball of a film where you don't like the characters and have no sense of sympathy for what happens to them.

Literally every contrivance, clich√©, and familiar plot element are somewhere in here; there is simply nothing unique, original, or fresh about it. God, what an agonizing motion picture to sit through; I wish I saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year's worst list. This is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious, and goes downhill from the opening credits, and worst of all, takes itself seriously. Here on Earth is clearly one of the most horrible, painful movies to come down the pike in some time.Here on Earth is a teen heartthrob film, so it must contain some of Hollywood's most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett fit that vary description, and take the lead roles by storm. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father (clich√© number one). He is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend Ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). This sets up the I don't want your life, clich√© in which the father tries to control his son's life, while the son resists rebelliously. Throw in Kelley's deceased mother who committed suicide a while back. When his father brings home another woman, he brutally questions his intentions (the  no one can replace mom clich√© counts as number two).Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the opposite side of society to Kelley. His family owns a local diner. Enter his long-time love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski) a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister (who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and (oh no) crashing into the diner, causing it to erupt into flames. (Conflicts between the rich and poor will count as clich√© number three.)The bungled car chase sets both Kelley and Jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict. They  get in trouble with the law, but because this movie feels the need to exist, the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time they must work together to help rebuild the diner.The two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan. Samantha's eye catches Kelley, and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants what is best for his true love (clich√© number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of her little romantic triangle (clich√© number five), but she continues two timing Jasper without a second thought. Her father also happens to be the local sheriff, how surprising (lets count that melodramatic nugget clich√© number six).The contrived romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as clich√© number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can there any romantic tension? If the film is going to induce involvement in Samantha's choice between the two young men, then we need to see both characters from both sides. The movie depicts Jasper as a distraction to her rightful love, Kelley. It's clear Jasper truly loves her, but it is also clear she does not love him back. This absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the story.Leelee Sobieski does no harm here; however, her charm and kind performance do not fit a two-timing character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with Kelley. Chris Klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here; he spends much of the movie shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability, maybe because he has very little. The supporting cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood supplies the best performance in the film, but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments. I also enjoyed the performance by Stuart Wilson, who perfectly fits the role of a rich, controlling father of high social status.Then we lean about Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie (another spoiler ahead). What is this, she has a serious incurable illness (yet another contrivance into the picture, approximately number eight). Her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends, well, at least I think that is what the movie intended to show, that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together (clich√© number nine).Klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype, but we have seen this so many times before I would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings (clich√© number, um, was it ten)?. The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and inane; a your mom comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment. There is a retread from Armageddon, as Samantha and Kelley sprawl out in an open field, horny as hell, as he slowly moves his fingers around her body, naming areas after US cities (why not call that number eleven). The movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension an intoxicated Kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with Samantha's date, Jasper, but the following day he recites desires only to dance (clich√© number, oh no, I am losing count).

Being at the advanced age of twenty-four and already having had two girlfriends (okay, one girlfriend and one exceptionally good female friend) die on me, I turned the DVD off feeling insulted. Mr. Cranky's review of the film says it all, but I thought I would offer some of my own personal commentary just to embellish the point.Ever heard the saying convert ****holes who, having accepted Jesus into their hearts, remain ****holes? Well, this film is a living example of it. I had as much sympathy for the characters in this film as I would have for a baked potato, and that did not change one iota by the end. The dead mother plot device might have done it for me - quite frankly, I would be very indifferent if my mother died, especially if she had done so when I was about ten years younger. Plot points follow this paragraph, by the way, but you might save yourself a lot of boredom if you just read them.The manner in which we are supposed to feel sympathy for Leelee Cantactworthadamn's character is simple. The writers and director decide to give her cancer. Apparently, she has broken her knee playing sports before, and the doctors tell her crying family that the possibility of a tumour growing in her leg as a result was always a possibility. What the f***? Having had a cancer dug out of my face myself, resulting in similar disfigurement to what Cybill Shepherd is reputedly going through at the moment, I find this plot device even more insulting now than I did when I saw the film. I will not feel sympathy for a cardboard cut-out if she dies of cancer, and I will want to kill her myself if she is afflicted with cancer via such a lousy, insulting, and just plain inconsistent with the facts setup as this. Hell, her family must belong to the HMO from Hades if cancer as the result of a knee injury was always a possibility, and yet it spreads throughout her body so far it cannot be rectified before anyone even notices!Of course, another source of eternal amusement is the contribution of music by Tori Amos, a woman who still apparently wishes she was more unusual than the chew-toys in breakfast cereals. I'd love to see the look on her face after being played some of the record collection I've put together after years of living in circumstances that would make the writers of this film shudder in terror. Which brings me to another point - when the hell is Hollywood going to stop insulting us with these pseudo-alternative films and present us with something truly exceptional again? One could could the current Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but that is only exceptional because of good source material and a quirky director. Hell On Earth, by comparison, seems geared to prove that Hollywood is only geared towards a very narrow, rigid demographic.In case I haven't impressed upon you how bad this trash is, let me close by just saying that this film's entire plot was done a billion times better in about twenty minutes of Groundhog Day.

Well, if you've ever wanted to see HIS story, this is the movie for you! Even though this came out 2 years BEFORE A Walk to Remember, it came out a year after the book - I don't know if someone at 20th Century Fox ordered some writers hey - make a movie kinda like this book NOW!, but what I do know is this movie sticks closer to the Sparks formula even moreso than AWTR! Besides Sparks standards like a small town, disapproving parents, class issues, disease, and death, this one throws in future Sparks tropes that were missing - love scene in the rain, multiple montages of people building or renovating something (usually a boat, tractor or a house; here a diner), a love triangle with a nice guy, and a PG-13, shot from the shoulders-up sex scene - they're all here. All we're missing is handwritten letters in a box and a North Carolina coastal setting and this would actually be the ultimate Sparks movie. I wonder if he consciously or subconsciously borrowed a bunch from this movie - a true Who Made Who? situation.But is it any good? It's entertaining and watchable, but it's also head-scratchingly wrongheaded in concept or execution. The main character is arrogant, he's sleazy, he's ungrateful, he makes fun of poor people - it seems like they're setting up some kind of redemption story, but then they forgot to film the redemption parts! He's just as big an a-hole at the end as he was at the beginning, and we're supposed to root for him for some reason as he steals another guy's girlfriend, then treats her like crap, then leaves and disses the entire town, then comes back like nothing happened. It might make some sense if Chris Klein showed any of his aw-shucks, goofy persona (from Election and American Pie, etc...) but he's simultaneously unlikable and uninteresting here, not to mention he bears a striking resemblance to mass murderer Elliot Rodger. I mean, look at his smug look on the cover, you're about to get a whole movie of that. This is the first Chris Klein movie where I don't want to hang out with his character (and yes this includes Street Fighter).Why are we supposed to cheer on Leelee Sobieski as she cheats on her boyfriend with this guy? They have zero chemistry and they never portray her boyfriend as anything less than a good guy, and I'd argue more women would choose Josh Hartnett over Chris Klein- it's mind-boggling that we're supposed to sympathize with her as she makes out with Klein RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER BOYFRIEND'S BEST FRIEND and he's supposed to be the bad guy for ratting them out?

Never in my life have I disliked a cancerous female leading character more than I did this girl. She is nothing more than a horny, cheating, BORING teenaged idiot who thinks she's in love with Chris Klein's character after knowing him for all of 10 minutes. Clearly, it's lust based on the fact that she fell for him after seeing him shirtless. I mean, come on. That's not love. That's pure sexual attraction. These two characters had NOTHING in common except for their love for poetry. Oh wait, and that they both have dull personalities. Maybe that's what brought them together. Throughout the movie, the only character I felt any remorse for was Josh Hartnett's character. It was absolutely heart-wrenching to watch this poor guy endure his girlfriend's obvious affair behind his back after the only thing he'd ever done was love her and be completely loyal to her in every possible way. And this b*tch goes and cheats on him with a rich pretty boy simply because he looks good without a shirt on. And then when we find out she has knee cancer, we're supposed to be all broken up inside and find it beautiful and touching that her ex-boyfriend and new boyfriend come together as friends to be with her on her last days alive. Yeah, NO. The two-timing tramp obviously learned nothing from having cancer since she felt she could just cheat on her boyfriend being that she was going to die anyway. Talk about going out with a bang! I guess she figured she might as well enjoy her last weeks on Earth screwing a hot guy behind her faithful boyfriend's back. If this girl was so bored and uninterested in her boyfriend, why didn't she just end it instead of cheating on him and making it SUPER obvious by making out with Chris Klein's character right in front of her boyfriend's best friend? It was almost like she WANTED to hurt him...for no reason! In fact, any decent human being would end a relationship even BEFORE meeting a new love interest if they were no longer in love with that person anymore. But alas, the leading lady in this movie was anything but a decent human being. So in conclusion, I despised this movie solely based on my hatred for the main female character played by the completely plain-looking and talentless LeeLee Sobieski.

Other than that I just watched Kline and Sobieski hold the same facial expressions and speak in the same tone the entire movie.  (If your tv is anything like mine, you're going to need to have the volume up as high as it can go if you want to decently hear the dialogue).I think that the plot upset me the most though about the film.  I like Hartnett's character from the start, probably because I was only watching the movie for him.  And Kline's character grew on me as I saw him change into a better person, plus the scene with the cows cracked me up.  But Sobieski's character made me so upset that I was wishing she'd die because she was just hurting the two boys.  Hartnett did nothing wrong to her and yet she cheated on him with a boy she didn't even know (he must've been a good kisser).  So you like the new boy in town, at least have the class and decency to break up with your boyfriend before you start making out, geography style, in the grass.I would give this movie a 1, but I think that Josh Hartnett, and the cows, saved it from that rating so I'm giving it a 2/10.

The characters are merely cookie cutter at best the young, doomed girl whom is torn between her love of the past and the breath of fresh air sweeping through the sleepy town; Kelley, the poor/rich boy who learns a life lesson and of course Jasper the jilted lover. Of these three I found Jasper to be the most interesting simply because he shows more than two emotions throughout the entire film.The romance (and I use that term loosely) between Kelley and Sam is missing. There is not enough development of these two as characters for me to care about their budding relationship. And what was that scene between them under the tree with the states? AWFUL! Boo! Hiss!Chris Klein is way too sensitive in this movie and Leelee Sobieski's movements are very awkward--in fact it is painful to watch her. (Think back to the scene in the kitchen with her dancing around) Josh Hartnett redeems the movie a bit with a character that actually has more than one layer.

I think most of the parts with Kelley (Chris Klein) and Sam were pretty typical of a romantic drama (the scene in which they lay in the grass & he begins kissing her & naming parts of her body after states reminded me of the scene with the animal crackers in Armageddon) and pretty boring but the scenes between Jasper and Sam or Jasper and Kelley made the movie worth watching.  I didn't like Kelley much but I think that when his character finally showed some emotion it made him a little more interesting.  I didn't like Samantha much at all, I thought she was pretty mean, so if she was supposed to come across as the innocent victim I don't think the writers did a very good job of doing so.  There were also three or four really funny parts (like the your mom jokes) that made the movie a little better then it would have been without them.

This brings him in contact with a girl with a secret (Leelee Sobieski), who finds herself torn between her new interest and a lifelong friend (Josh Hartnett).The perpetual teen film takes on a new direction with far more sobering, sometimes sweet, but over-sentimental tale of young love. Borrowing from staple fare such as the 1970s weepies Love Story and Sunshine, Here on Earth, the title of which stems partly from the poetry of Robert Frost, has some rather nice moments, but is ultimately simplistic and trite, to appeal to a cynical audience. Teenage girls, however, a largely untapped market, may warm to this tale of love, life and death, and the participation of an attractive trip of actors. The movie suffers from Michael Seitzman's wishy-washy script, one that is too obvious for its own good, and director Mark Piznarki, in his feature debut, milks the material for all its worth. Plus points are some beautiful cinematography (on location in Minnesota) and a strong soundtrack. Performances are varied. Chris Klein, resembling a young Keanu, shows as much dramatic range. Effective in less demanding roles (American Pie and Election), Klein is clearly uncomfortable as a straight dramatic actor. His stronger co-stars overshadow him, beginning with Sobieski, who photographs beautifully, and conveys the right qualities for the fragile and poetic character she beautifully plays. Hartnett is a rare find, and will be seen later in Virgin Suicides to better advantage, though here he gives a rather nice and intelligent performance in a simple character.There are some lovely elements in Here on Earth, and for its target audience, it's a welcome change from male-dominated teen dramas that flood the market. Male audiences will be turned off by the film's excessive sentimentality and consistent references to Frost. This is a well-intentioned film that could have been more effective as a solid drama, had it not been for its simplistic approach to the material, and the wooden performance of its lead actor.

The fault I believe lays in the development of the love between Kelley and Samantha. Is there an actually relationship going on between Samantha and her previous boyfriend or was he always her best friend? Could Kelley actually show some emotion instead having to relay his feelings in a drunken stupor? Or why does Samantha always have to yearn for Kelley?Another eminent fault is in the story itself. The story is so predictable and vacant of depth I am not sure if the actors had much to work with. I have to stop and think, would this film have been deeper, passionate and maybe have a heart if a woman had written the screenplay? Maybe this kind of emotion comes with experience. My third and final fault is that these actors are to good for this material. Sobrieski is developing into a young Helen Hunt and has shown a lot of depth in previous projects. She riveting as Joan of Ark. Klein needs to loosen up a lot but he still needed a little more depth in Kelley. The film&#146;s supporting cast Michael Rooker, Annette O&#146;Toole, and Bruce Greenwood are a lot better actors than the wooden country town people here. Boy, does O&#146;Toole look bored.  	Don&#146;t get me wrong but there are some things I did like about the film. Its nice to see that Hollywood is once again attempting to try to make an epic teenage love story. The Romeo and Juliet concept is still a glorious tool when used with passion. The best example was James Cameron&#146;s Titanic. The actors there didn&#146;t have much more to work with then these but through the story-telling and the characters growth we believed their epic romantic journey. Another thing I liked was the music Andrea Morricone, son of renowned composer Ennio Morricone, shows he has his father&#146;s gift. I also credit director Mark Piznarski for holding the film together but like the film&#146;s writer Michael Seitzman experience will hone these guys into better players.

What was supposed to me a touching, moving romance about 2 teens that fall in love was ruined by a really lousy script, so-so acting, and all together I didn't think the story was put together very well. How do all these girls find Josh Harnett attractive?? He has the worst most irritating hair of any actor. The bangs cut straight across and his hair sticks out in the back, and in this movie he was wearing a green baseball cap that didn't go with anything he was wearing. Bad wardrobe!!! The movie is about 2 teenagers that fall in love. Kelley played by Chris Klein (a major HOTTIE) and Sam played by LeeLee Sobieski. Kelly is a spoiled rich kid who has to help rebuild the restraunt that Sam's family owns since he was involved in causing it to burn down. Even though Sam already has a boyfriend, Jasper-played by Josh Harnett, that doesn't stop Kelley from going after to her, much to the anger of Jasper. Sam finally ditches Jasper to fall in love with Kelley, even though her parents strongly disapprove of Kelley. She then finds out she has cancer but this doesn't get told to Kelley until about 3/4 into the movie and its sort of just dropped out of nowehere. This could have been a good movie but the terrible writing ruined it. It was very plain dialogue and there is not one memorable line that came from this movie. There are a couple parts in the film where lines just get blurted out of nowhere that have nothing to do with the scene. For instance when Sam is laying in bed ill from the cancer, her dad sits down to talk to her and out of nowhere says I wish you hadn't met that Kelley kid. ??? Okay...so out of nowhere he says that.  Then towards the end of the film, Kelley has to go back to live with his parents because the restaraunt is finished. So even though he is in love with Sam and she is ill, he just packs up and leaves??? He then comes to his senses and comes back but it was just silly. But this movie isn't a total disaster. It does have an awesome soundtrack and some nice scenery was shown in the film as well.Overall I give it 4/10.

Here is FOX 2000, probably investing several millions into a production that should have never been distributed as a feature film.  Here on Earth is a film worthy of a video release only. From the first line of dialogue, you know you will see characters that are stereotypes.  You are disappointed afterwards to find that they are not even that.  They are just cardboard characters, whose motivation is never understood at any time.  Things happen to them and they make decisions, but never with any real motivation. As with any love film, the chemistry between the leads is the most important aspect.  The two actors do make a fine couple visually, although emotionally they are not so touching. Leelee Sobieski is a really fine actress, as she has proven in both Joan of Arc and a not so great Merchant-Ivory film.  But her talents are completely wasted here.  Why she ever decided to take this role is beyond me.  It is a more adult and sexy role, but not a deep one. For Chris Klein, on the other hand, this could have been step forward.  He has already proven himself as a comic actor, always taking the role of the not-so-intelligent hunk, in both Election and American Pie.  Here he goes for both the leading man and a more dramatic role.  I hate to say that he does not succeed in either.  His most memorable moment is his funny bit speaking drunk to the cows.  But it is not entirely his fault, when the material is so weak. The film does offer some nice photography here and there, but there's very little creatively done in the composition of the shots. While obviously trying hard to be the Love Story of 2000, with a very similar structure, the film fails to capture what made that old movie an instant classic.

I saw it about two years ago, so forgive me if I don't correctly recall parts of this film.It starts with Chris Klein and his buddies sneaking out of their prep school to go cruising in his new car.  They go to a small diner, and start hitting on their waitress, Leelee Sobieski.  Her boyfriend who is also there, Josh Hartnett, sees this and goes over to tell them to back off, which, in the real world is a completely normal thing to do as well as expected. Things happen, blah blah.  They end up racing, and crashing into the gas station just outside the diner.  Boom.  It blows up, nobody gets hurt. They are told by a judge that they will both help rebuild the diner. Chris Klein who doesn't live in the area ends up staying with Josh's family, in the garage.  La la la.There are some serious subplots going on  Chris Klein has issues with his dad, Leelee is avoiding knee surgery, there's a whole thing with Josh's family I believe.  Now, on top of all of that, Leelee gives Josh the ol' boot, because she falls in love with Chris.  More silliness ensues. Now, the end is actually funny and sad.  Leelee, who has been putting off this knee surgery, dies of the knee injury.  Possible?  It probably is, you know, infections and all, but, do you feel bad for her, not at all.  Not only did she do it to herself, (I can't quite remember what happens, but something like she cancels the appointment for surgery, or just doesn't go), but it's a little ridiculous.Now we're at her funeral, where Chris I believe reads Leelee's favorite poem or some silliness, and if I recall correctly, there's really not all that much emotion going on with him.  Now we go to the back of the church, and there's our friend Josh, hysterically crying.Ok, you tell me who do we feel bad for?  Chris?  He loses the girl that he stole from Josh, and she's dead now, although he doesn't seem to be that broken up about it.  Leelee?  The girl who crushes Josh's heart and runs off with Chris, only to be completely stupid and ends up pretty much killing herself.  Or Josh?  The man who was simply protecting his girlfriend, whom he truly loved and was then snubbed, and loses her, not just once to Chris, but a second time, when she dies.I vote Josh.  The poor guy probably kills himself later, or drinks himself to death.Anyway, terrible, terrible movie.  Now I know that a lot of people are probably like, relax, it's just a movie, or, you don't understand the romance of the film.  But, I'm just as much a sap for good love stories as anyone else.  This however, does not qualify as a good love story.  And, if you saw someone blindly walking in front of a speeding car, wouldn't you at least shout to them?

I mean, thank God they didn't decide to cast Jason Biggs somewhere in this movie. I'm hoping against all odds to never see him on screen again. But on the other hand, Chris Klein and Leelee Sobieski didn't exactly draw out the emotions the way that a quality romance should. Despite the many shortcomings of Here On Earth, it did have many redeeming values. The rivalry between the rich kids at the private school and the poor kids in town, although slightly exaggerated, was fairly well presented. It is never satisfactorily explained why Klein (whose character is curiously named Kelley) felt that it was so necessary to eat dinner in the poor town just after having been given a brand new car (during the Mercedes-Benz commercial that is the beginning of the film), but the ensuing scene in the restaurant, although followed by an idiotic car chase, was actually pretty well done (`What did he say?' `I think he said come kick my ass.').The love triangle that takes place between Kelley, Samantha (Sobieski), and Jasper (Josh Hartnett, whose great performance single-handedly provides about 90% of the reason to watch this film) is one of the better parts of the movie, and it is definitely the element of the movie that somewhat sets it apart from the multitude of cheesy teen romance films that are constantly being cranked out these days. Although this particular predicament is fairly entertaining, Jasper's change of heart just comes too suddenly and too completely, especially given the constant tension between himself (as well as most of his immediate family) and Kelley, who are forced to live together as they work to rebuild the diner that they collectively destroyed in that dumbass car chase earlier in the film.The end of the film was pretty obvious from the beginning, but in case you haven't seen this movie (and haven't seen the movie's cover, which should qualify as a spoiler in itself), I guess I should warn you that there's a spoiler ahead. Before this movie even starts, you know that Kelley and Samantha will fall in love just as surely as you know that there will be a Running Through The Woods Scene somewhere in the movie and that at some point, someone will utter the hopelessly clich√©d line `Some people live their whole lives and never fall in love.' It is clear that there is nothing new here in the form of romance, and even the fact that Samantha dies does not make it original, because this has been seen plenty of times before, such as in the spectacular Best Picture of 1994. Despite the fact that the entire film is one big clich√©, there were several quality performances in the film, particularly from Josh Hartnett, Leelee Sobieski, and Michael Rooker, in a well-cast role as Jasper's overbearing father. And yes, even Chris Klein delivered a satisfactory performance as the out-of-place rich kid, despite having been cast against the type of character that he has come to be known as from previous films. There is no new ground covered by Here On Earth, but there is something to be said for the fact that despite its total unoriginality, it is still able to keep your attention.

The movie had extremely inadequate characterization, a lack of depth, and no continuity. The plot was hard to follow at best.  There was no background information - it seemed that we were just jumping into a very poorly written sitcom in the middle of the season. Each scene had little connection with any other.  It was very choppy. You hope that after a film is edited, there is at least some flow, but in this case there was none. You could almost take the scenes and place them in any order you desire and the end result would not be any different. I didn't even know a few of the characters' names until close to the end of the film.  The characters were not believeable and I didn't feel any connection to them.  I was not drawn to the story, or lack thereof, because the entire film was so erratic. It made no sense. I gather that it was supposed to be a love story but Here on Earth had me and my friends laughing hysterically from the sheer absurdity of it all. You want dynamic characters in a movie, but Chris Klein's jumped around so much that you couldn't tell if he was coming or going. Leelee Sobieski came across as a desperate and selfish, which I'm sure was not the intent. As for the love story - it just wasn't there. It was contrived to say the least.  The only believeable person was Josh Hartnett.  I feel very sorry that Sobieski was in this film. She is a far greater actress than this movie deserves.  Here on Earth is among the top five worst films I have ever seen.  Do not see it unless you are looking for a laughing fest at its expense.  Even then, you might be better off renting something with Robin Williams.

The dialogue is trivial, and delivered as if even the actors know how ridiculous they sound. The soundtrack is replete with cliche strings which all sound in grand, sweeping moments during which several teenage girls in the audience can be seen quietly weeping. Chris Klein, the arrogant prep student turned bleeding heart romantic, was far better in films like American Pie where his goofy, dumb love was charming and worked in the situations far better. In HoE, Klein tries very hard to be a jerk and tries even harder to become a hopeless lover. The other actors in the film, like Hartnett, deliver solid performances but certainly nothing to write home about. Here on Earth plays out like a cheap Hallmark card.

And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year. I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself. This is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films I have ever seen. It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY. And I am not being unfair. This is an awful film.This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk. Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet? Let me continue. One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together. What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him. He has abs!!! Oh and he is rich!!! And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone. He is James Dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!! He is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat. But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him. There is no reason given as to why she does, she just does. Oh, pardon me, that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does. Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will.Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film. There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fianc√©e exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes. Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene. And furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen. Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot. It is not a pretty picture. Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant. What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease. And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous. There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character. He is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him. Here On Earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one. This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that is way too high. This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.0 out of 10, and that is being generous.

It is far from the greatest of films, but it was touching in many ways. It is rather formulaic, but the formula works here for the most part. A rich upstart teenager comes into a small town and manages to get into a fight with a local and burn down the local diner. In a made-for-television kind of Solomonic wisdom, the judge sentences them to work together to rebuild the diner, Mabel's Table, the 'hot spot' of this whistle-stop town. Rich out-of-towner and local boy fight over the local girl, who has a tragic secret she is concealing.Leelee Sobieski, plays the lead as Samantha, the local girl track star whose knee gave out, jeopardising her chance to go to college. Chris Klein plays Kelley, the spoiled rich kid who is nonetheless intelligent and has a heart he begins to discover during his time in the small town. Josh Hartnett is Jasper, the local boy who wants nothing more than to keep things the way they are, including his relationship with Samantha. Most of these performances are serviceable without being stellar; they are typical romantic B-film fare, with many long, ponderous glances overlooking scenic views, and silly situations in which everyday life is shown.The action is slow, but then, it isn't meant to be a fast-paced film. Samantha is torn between the comfortable sameness of her life in the small town with Jasper and her family, and the attraction that rich 'bad boy' Kelley represents, particularly after she learns he does have a heart. Samantha overhears Kelley reciting the valedictory speech he was prevented from delivering because of his sentence to build the diner; Kelley in the end does get to the deliver the speech, under different circumstances.Jasper and Kelley fight (both verbally and physically) over the affections of Samantha, but when Samantha falls ill, they are able to put this aside for her sake. The diner is rebuilt, the town is restored to wholeness, but the situation with Jasper, Kelley and Samantha enters a new dimension, as fate has a different ending in store that none of them anticipated at the beginning of the summer.The other actors in the film are really background for the tale - few stand out, but one who does is Annette O'Toole, who plays Samantha's mother, a role very similar to the one she takes up on 'Smallville' as Clark Kent's mother.The story is gentle, sad, poignant - not terribly original, but very understandable in human terms. Love is unpredictable, and love often hurts. Love sometimes requires a sacrifice. Love can transform you.

A very natural actor, he does what he can in a thankless role.  It was very hard to believe he could ever throw himself on the likes of Leelee Sobieski, a Helen Hunt look alike - without the talent, who seems to go around having the hots for another guy who comes to town, without even batting an eye to those around her that love her.  No sympathy from this viewer and I couldn't wait for her demise.This tiny epic was written badly by Michael Seitzman, what else has he done, and directed by Mark Piznarski, who had the sense to back up Miss Sobieski's bad acting with an amazing cast.  Noteworthy are Chris Klein as the out-of-towner, Bruce Greenwood and the wonderful Annette O'Toole as the girl's parents.  They all do admirable jobs with stale dialogue. Oh yes, the Judge was terrific and had one of the best scenes.I apologize again for repeating which many others have done before me, but I just had to make my comments.

I must see for any die hard Josh or Chris fans.","Date":"27 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Before i start i better mention that i have been a huge fan of Josh Hartnett for a couple of years now.  Here on Earth wasn't released in theatres in the UK so i had to wait until the start of may 2001 until i could see it on TV.The main plot revolves around a love triangle, a rich student and a girl from the wrong side of the tracks fall in love with each other, yet she already has a boyfriend who she's been friends with since childhood.I had previously read reviews of this movie which mainly consisted of bad ones.  Although i did enjoy this movie i found it was seriously flawed and that most of the reviewers criticisms were true.  The script is the main this wrong with this movie, it is so dated and wouldn't look out of place in the 50's.  It is also corny and really unbelievable in places, as well as some of the characters being two dimentional.  The relationship between Kelley (Chris Klein)and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) doesn't really work that well as the way the script is written you end up feeling sorry for Jasper (Josh Hartnett).  Kelley seemed unlikeable from the start as he comes across as being arrogant and spoilt, and it is blindingly obvious that Samantha is looking for someone else (other than Jasper) from the beginning.  This makes it hard to be sympathetic towards their situation, and characters, which ruins the whole point of the story.  The acting is good especially as the actors had to cope with this terrible script.  Hartnett definetaly stands out from the rest but there isn't enough required from his character for him to show his full potential.  The main scene's including Jasper only require him to look broken hearted and pathetic, which would make anyone fall in love with his character even more.  Like many critics have said, the story would have worked better if Jasper was even remotely dislikeable.  Leelee also does well with her character as it is clear Samantha is in love with Kelley yet does not want to hurt Jasper.  Klein does ok yet his character seems wooden in places, so much that the script writers had to resort to him taking his shirt off to distract the audience from the awful diologue in then scene where they talk about handcuffs.  Kelley's feelings towards Samantha are also not clear, he is supposed to be in love with her yet he doesn't show much emotion towards her.  The supporting cast does well, i felt the character of Jasper's mom was most prominent as the relationship between mother and son was portrayed really well in the scene infront of the piano.  Samantha's relationship with her father was also good and it did feel as if her and Jasper had been friends since childhood.  I also enjoyed the scenes between Kelley and Jasper as their verbal sparring provided most of the humour from this movie (especially Kelley's constant reference to the relationship Jasper has with his cows).The main flaw of this movie is that it does not seem to 'flow' smoothly and so seems to 'jump' from scene to scene.  In many places it also seems rushed as if the story jumps forward in time to quickly.  It then ends too abruptly with a tragic event which seems as if it is stuck on the end because to writers were rushed and couldn't think of anything better.  I feel that if it was developed slower throughout the whole movie the writers could have got away with such a cliche'd ending.  I must admit it did bring a few tears to my eyes (although i do tend to cry easily at movies)Overall i would say this film is....................OK as i did enjoy it, i found it became better the more times i watched it.  It is definetally worth watching if you are a huge Josh or Chris fan or even if you've got nothing better to do.  It can be enjoyed by others if you're expectations are not too high but it is clear why it wasn't released in theatres in the UK.

The only reason I saw it was because I'm a huge Josh Hartnett fan. Before seeing the movie, I predicted that Lee Lee S. would die in the end and that she would choose Chris Klein (Kelley) over Josh Hartnett (Jasper). I was right. First of all the theme song to this movie, Where You Are performed by Jessica Simpson is a huge giveaway. The song is about your loved one dying so you knew someone was gonna die. For me, it was pretty obvious it was gonna be the girl because she's the one torn between Kelley and Jasper. If you saw the video to Where You Are you knew she was gonna choose Chris Klein at the end because only Lee Lee S. and Chris Klein are in it. I also found some parts of this movie to be unrealistic. For example, I don't know any girl who would choose UGLY Chris Klein over the GORGEOUS Josh Hartnett. Not only is Josh much more attractive, but he told Lee Lee S. that he loved her 2 times, was there for her when she was in the hospital, and put her needs before his own. I don't recall Chris Klein doing any of those things. Clearly, Kelley really didn't love her because instead of going down to see her, he asks Josh how she is. Josh Hartnett was clearly the best actor in this film. He was the only one, I thought, that was capable of showing emotion in this film. Lee Lee S. is a great actress, but I thought she could give a better performance. It may sound like I hate this movie, but I thought it was OK. Some parts of it were a little hard for me to swallow though. I give it a 7 out of 10.

And Leelee did an excellent job of portraying her character.  She was believable.  Chris Klein on the other hand didn't thrill me.  In my opinion he is a horrible actor.  I don't know it could just be this movie.  I don't really remember his performance in American Pie but that could be because that was horrible too.Okay yeah, the movie has some cliches but that doesn't make it horrible. It's realistic.  A girl has a longtime boyfriend and then a new guy comes into town that she's attracted to so of course she's going to check him out. There is nothing unrealistic about this plot.  It's about a girl torn between two guys.  And again, yeah, it may be a plot that's been used, but so what.  It happens all the time.  Plots are always being reused.  It was told in a different way. I would recommend seeing it and I would have cried at the end if i wasn't laughing at my friends brother who was making jokes.

But instead of jail time or fines, he and Hartnett are sentenced to help rebuild the local eatery, which will hopefully build some character in them.  Klein overcomes his overbearing father and memory of his dead mother to do just that.  Of course, Klein falls for the local girl (Sobieski) who just happens to be Hartnett's girl.  Sort of a Love Story meets Breaking Away meets School Ties.Predictable?  Pretty much, though I was surprised by a few things.  Recycled plots?  Yes.  But sometimes there's nothing wrong with that.  There are plenty of great movies that borrow heavily from prior ones.  Some even turn out much better than their predecessors.  Here on Earth is actually very well written (with a few exceptions that you'll know when you see) and very well acted for the piece of teen fluff that it seems to be.  The setup is believable and doesn't seem forced like it does in so many of today's teen movie trash.  The dialogue is pretty real and smart, again, not like you get in most teen movies.  The principal actors give very mature performances, especially Sobieski and Hartnett.  The end comes a little too quickly in that the last few scenes are sort of rushed through and there is one scene in the movie that is absolutely embarrasing to watch (it's right up there with Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and the animal crackers in Armageddon).  Aside from these flaws, I thought Here on Earth was very good and a solid attempt at an semi-intelligent teen oriented movie.  One thing in particular I enjoyed was that the hero/villain aspect between Klein and Hartnett wasn't black and white.  The movie tries to paint both as pretty good guys at heart and doesn't necessarily make you want to see Klein and Sobieski together.  I actually liked Hartnett's character more in the end.It's too bad that garbage with Freddie Prinze and scantily clad girls dancing on top of bars is seen and movies like this are not.

However, it seems that is all she is good at.  Her acting skills do not go beyond her aesthetic qualities, making for an extremely dull character.  Additionally, it didn't help that she was given lines that sounded more like cliches than actual sentences, or that her character was written as completely wishy-washy.  All of that said, add in two good looking guys who had even less personality, a small town in Western Massachusetts (which was actually filmed in Minnesota) and an obligatory kissing-in-the-rain scene, and you have the disaster that is `Here on Earth.'Perhaps the underlying problem of the movie is that the plot was not only one big cliche,but a cliche stolen from countless other movies.  Sobieski plays Samantha, a recent high school graduate with no money who dreams of attending medical school.  For most of high school, she has been dating her lifelong best friend, Jasper (Josh Hartnett).  Just as they are about to carve their names into the `lover's wall' in her family's restaurant, rich kid Kelley (Chris Klein) swoops into town and steals Sam's heart.  Obviously, Jasper and Kelley don't get along well, which is very unfortunate considering that they are forced to live together after they burn down Sam's restaurant during a drag race.  Unfortunately, the audience is then forced to sit through about an hour of Sam's developing relationship with Kelley, while she strings Jasper along because she doesn't have the guts to tell him she's moved on.Although this has the potential to be a heartwarming love story, it is ruined by the sappy and contrived dialogue.  It felt as though writer Michael Seitzman just jotted down every single pick up line he had ever tried and failed at, and then decided that even though they failed in real life, they might work in the movies.  As a result, the audience was forced to sit through such conversations as Kelly asking Sam (referring to her father), `Do you always bring the sheriff on dates?' to which she replies (with about as much enthusiasm as a rock), `Not if I'm the one breaking the law.' Yawn.  A particularly excruciating moment was when the couple, after running through a sprawling meadow, shares an intimate moment reminiscent of Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in Armageddon. After Kelley names all of Sam's body parts after states, he finally calls her lips Massachusetts, to which she replies, `Massachusetts welcomes you.' Amused yet? That's not all.  In an effort to either move the audience, or make us laugh even harder (it was hard to tell by this point), Sam discovers she has terminal illness √† la Love Story.  Note to director Mark Piznarski Although this simple plot device worked for Love Story  thirty years ago, that kind of  sappiness just doesn't cut it when your cast can barely muster up any kind of emotion.Needless to say, the audience was in hysterics (with laughter) by the end.   Because of this instinct to just laugh at it, the movie was enjoyable in that guilty pleasure, Lifetime movie kind of way.  Plus, it had that pretty song with that guy from 98 Degrees...
