[{"Title":"Haunting and disturbing, but ultimately redemptive","Date":"23 October 2003","Score":"131 out of 163 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":"   I avoided this when it came out in 1989 having seen Coming Home (1978)   and not wanting to revisit the theme of paraplegic sexual dysfunction   and frustration. I also didn't want to reprise the bloody horror of our   involvement in the war in Vietnam that I knew Oliver Stone was going to   serve up. And Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic? I just didn't think it would   work.    Well, my preconceptions were wrong.    First of all, for those who think that Tom Cruise is just another   pretty boy (which was basically my opinion), this movie sets that   mistaken notion to rest. He is nothing short of brilliant in a role   that is enormously demanding--physically, mentally, artistically, and   emotionally. I don't see how anybody could play that role and still be   the same person. Someday in his memoirs, Tom Cruise is going to talk   about being Ron Kovic as directed by Oliver Stone.    And second, Stone's treatment of the sex life of Viet Vets in   wheelchairs is absolutely without sentimentality or silver lining.   There are no rose petals and no soft pedaling. There was no Jane Fonda,   as in Coming Home, to play an angel of love. Instead the high school   girl friend understandably went her own way, and love became something   you bought if you could afford it.    And third, Stone's depiction of America--and this movie really is about   America, from the 1950s to the 1970s--from the pseudo-innocence of   childhood war games and 4th of July parades down Main street USA to   having your guts spilled in a foreign land and your brothers-in-arms   being sent home in body bags--was as indelible as black ink on white   parchment. He takes us from proud moms and patriotic homilies to the   shameful neglect in our Veteran's hospitals to the bloody clashes   between anti-war demonstrators and the police outside convention halls   where reveling conventioneers wave flags and mouth phony slogans.    I have seen most of Stone's work and as far as fidelity to authentic   detail and sustained concentration, this is his best. There are a   thousand details that Stone got exactly right, from Dalton Trumbo's   paperback novel of a paraplegic from WW I, Johnny Got His Gun, that sat   on a tray near Kovic's hospital bed, to the black medic telling him   that there was a more important war going on at the same time as the   Vietnam war, namely the civil rights movement, to a mother throwing her   son out of the house when he no longer fulfilled her trophy case vision   of what her son ought to be, to Willem DaFoe's remark about what you   have to do sexually when nothing in the middle moves.    Also striking were some of the scenes. In particular, the confession   scene at the home of the boy Kovic accidentally shot; the Mexican   brothel scene of sex/love desperation, the drunken scene at the pool   hall bar and the pretty girl's face he touches, and then the drunken,   hate-filled rage against his mother, and of course the savage hospital   scenes--these and some others were deeply moving and likely to haunt me   for many years to come.    Of course, as usual, Oliver Stone's political message weighed heavily   upon his artistic purpose. Straight-laced conservatives will find his   portrait of America one-sided and offensive and something they'd rather   forget. But I imagine that the guys who fought in Vietnam and managed   to get back somehow and see this movie, will find it redemptive.   Certainly to watch Ron Kovic, just an ordinary Joe who believed in his   country and the sentiments of John Wayne movies and comic book heroics,   go from a depressed, enraged, drug-addled waste of a human being to an   enlightened, focused, articulate, and ultimately triumphant spokesman   for the anti-war movement, for veterans, and the disabled was wonderful   to see. As Stone reminds us, Kovic really did become the hero that his   misguided mother dreamed he would be.    No other Vietnam war movie haunts me like this one. There is something   about coming back less than whole that is worse than not coming back at   all that eats away at our consciousness. And yet in the end there is   here displayed the triumph of the human will and a story about how a   man might find redemption in the most deplorable of circumstances.    --Dennis Littrell, author of Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't   Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

While Platoon, Stone's totally personal account of the Vietnam war is quite accurate and superb in many ways, this film is better if only because it's not Stone's story. He takes the tale of Ron Kovic (who wrote the book with the same name as the film and scripted by him and Stone) and turns it into a blisteringly awesome and ultimately harrowing picture that has performances, scenes and direction that top Platoon (maybe it's a sign that practice makes perfect)Anyway, the tale centers on Ron Kovic (played to a utter T by Tom Cruise) good old-boy-type of American kid who decides he wants to fight for his country in the Vietnam war even if he has to die for his country. He fights, witnesses horror and makes a tragic mistake and comes back home a crippled from the waist down veteran, who has to endure the emotional and physical pain of just being a veteran of Vietnam in a country where they are put down more than revered. All this, and more (including one of the most volcanic scenes I have ever seen between Cruise and Dafoe on a Mexico road) lead him to become a anti-war activist.In making the big theme of the picture Kovic and his feeling on the war, Stone depicts his journey excellently by showing his desire to be in it, his confusion afterwards, his eventual hatred and then placement in being against the war all the while still being a patriot. Not only does it work as a saga/war movie, but also as a 180 degree change tale. Must, must see for all Stone fans and for anybody who wants to see what Cruise can actually do with proper direction and script.

Indeed, he was right. 'Born On the Fourth Of July,' based on the book by Ron Kovic, follows Kovic's account of his experiences in Vietnam and the indifferent nation that he returned to. Although released in 1989, it holds up to the current situation that exists in Iraq now-many refer to it as the new Vietnam. Regardless of anyone's opinion on the current Iraq war, 'Born On the Fourth of July' is one of the most affecting, and important war related films of all time. As the film opens, we find a young Kovic pretending to be a soldier with friends-a time when the idea of being a soldier was heroic since their father's had been heroes in WWII. The film then follows Kovic as a popular athlete in high school up to his recruitment as a Marine. Kovic rationalizes his reasons for joining up as Communists have missiles pointed at us now and we have to save our country from its threats. During his time in Vietnam, Kovic sees the true nature of war. His platoon mistakenly fires upon a town where the enemy is supposedly hiding; however, they end up killing women and children. During the confusion that follows, Kovic accidentally shoots a fellow soldier-his guilt would encompass him for years to come. But when Kovic himself is wounded in a field, he is sent home paralyzed from the waist down. He spends the first few months in a veteran hospital, which in this case, was a slum. The doctors inform him that he will never be able to use his legs again, and that he no longer has the ability to have children. When he returns to his home, he realizes that the world has changed. People protest the war, sometimes protesting against the soldiers themselves. His own family is indifferent to the war, as are his old friends. In one scene, he is told by an old friend who has become successful as a fast food manager, 'people here-they don't give a s**t about the war! To them it's just a million miles away.'Eventually becoming disillusioned by everything in his hometown, Kovic spends a great deal of time with other veterans like himself at a resort in Mexico. Later he becomes an activist-his first public activism took place at the 1972 Republican National Convention where he was televised for exposing the reality of what soldiers endured in Vietnam, but also on the reasons why we did not belong there in the first place. 'Born On the Fourth of July' spends a good deal of time focusing on the misplaced patriotism that the politicians spewed at the public to drum up support not only for Vietnam, but the Cold War, in general. The film shows this by Kovic's own mother constantly reminding her son that he was doing the right thing by going over there and fighting and that he was in God's hands. When Kovic returns home and his disillusionment grows, he gets drunk one night and yells at his mother, 'There is no God. There is only me in this chair for the rest of my life!'The film does stand up today just as strong as ever. With soldiers returning home from Iraq, and the constant media attention of terrorist attacks over there and seeing our own soldiers ambushed all the time, those who fight now must feel the same anger and frustration that Kovic felt year ago. It does make one wonder, when will the politicians ever truly get it! **** "},{"Title":"Don't overlook the story","Date":"14 February 2002","Score":"51 out of 61 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":"  You've heard the express can't see the forest for the trees, right?  It refers to someone who gets so caught up in details, they miss the big picture.  Reading other comments on IMDb regarding Born on the Fourth of July, I think people have the opposite problem with this film.  So many people seem to get caught up in talking about Vietnam, war, Nixon, America, Communism, and hippies, that they totally overlook Ron Kovic. Ron Kovic is the center of this film.  In Platoon, war was the center, and the central character (Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor) was merely a POV character through whose eyes we could see war.  Not so in Born on the Fourth of July.  Vietnam is the setting, the context, and the backdrop.  But Ron Kovic is the story.  Oliver Stone really understands a character arc.  Look at Kovic's life, where it starts, where it ends.  The film is the journey, how he got from A to B.  It is a dramatization of a life, as opposed to an actual life, but it still rings true.  It feels true.  It reaches an artistic level of truth, even if some literal truths are overlooked, distorted, or rearranged.  That's what Stone is trying to do.  People who quibble about the facts miss the point.  (This is a theme I will take up again when I review some of Stone's other films, as Stone is constantly being bashed for historical inaccuracies.)  The connections from one point to the next work admirably, and the progression is completely believable, which is quite a feat for such a dramatic change of attitude (compare to American History X, where the main character goes through a similar about face with scant motivation). Anyway, what impresses me about this film is the honesty and respect with which Stone presents the opposing views of the film.  Say what you want about Stone's political beliefs, but the argument in this film is presented in a very neutral light.  It's a story about Kovic's choices, Kovic's politics, Kovic's judgments.  And the anti-Vietnam beliefs he finally supports in the final act are a very natural and believable outcome of the story.  This film isn't anywhere near as didactic as some people like to imagine.  The tragedy of Oliver Stone is that, because he has been so edgy, so controversial, so deliberately provocative, no one can really just sit down and, with a neutral eye, watch his films.  They have become so burdened by this giant, irrelevant, political squabble.  The films have been subsumed by the very issues they sought to raise.  And it's a shame, with this film especially, because it is excellent.  Tom Cruise gives possibly the greatest performance of his career (I can't think of anything that tops it, though his performance in Eyes Wide Shut, for very different reasons, is just as remarkable).  The script is fantastic, taking time where it needs to take time, but not overly deliberate in its approach.  It's very economical with time.  It knows what each scene needs to say, and says it without any excess baggage, wasted space, or dead time.  The direction is excellent, as is the editing and cinematography.  The supporting cast is excellent.  But this movie would be nothing without the remarkable, heart-rending, true story of Ron Kovic.  So, while we admire the technical achievement of the film, while we debate the points raised, while we enshrine or excoriate the director (as the case may be), let's not forget the story.  Let's not get so fired up about Vietnam that we forget Ron Kovic.  He is the heart and soul of this film.  One final note  I bristle when people call this an anti-war film.  That really diminishes it, I think.  It's so much more than that.  It's not just saying that war is brutal, nasty, and horrific.  It's saying something far more specific about a specific war, and about the effect of that war on a specific man.

I believe that for a movie to be great, it should move you.  It should make you think.  It should make you reconsider your views and outlooks.  It should make you take a closer look at its subject matter.  It should draw attention to itself.  Above all, you should gain some amount of enjoyment from a great film.  I believe that BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was a great film.  I say this because, whether or not you agree with Ron Kovic's message, and although Oliver Stone almost ruined it with his attempts to personalize reality, the movie still made people stop and look.  It literally defined the Vietnam War for a generation of Tom Cruise fans, and made many more aware of what the vets went through.  The cinematography, score and fabulous acting made it a pleasure for many people to watch, if only to see how Cruise would deliver his next line.The film grossed $70,001,698 nationwide.  In 1989, when BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was released, movie tickets cost five dollars.  Therefore, over fourteen million American people went to the theater to see this movie. The number of viewers increases when you take into consideration the people who rented it on video or watched a television broadcast.  It had that special something that made people think about issues that they might not have thought about before.  It is lamentable that by 1989, many of the members of Generation X had paid little or no attention to the Vietnam War, even though only sixteen years had passed since the war's end.  The younger generation was reminded that the war did, indeed, happen, and that the country was still being lambasted with the side effects.The camera work was extremely effective in relaying the messages in the film.  Different moods within the film were indicated by different tints in the color.  Combats were filmed in red, while blue indicated sadness, and white tints where used in the dream sequences.  Whether intended or not, the colors of choice also coincide with that of the American flag, which is very appropriate for the film.  The film also employed a wide variety of interesting angles without becoming confusing to the viewer.The musical score is one of the best of all time.  John Williams is a genius in the music industry.  His fabulous music can make a film feel the way it was intended to.  He seems to simply know what sequence of notes will produce what emotions.  Along with Williams' music, the score also includes some of the popular music from the time of the film's setting.  For instance, AMERICAN PIE by Don McLean, MY GIRL by the Temptations, and MOONRIVER by Henry Mancini, all give the viewer who remembers the music a sense of nostalgia, taking them back to those years.Two words sum up why the movie got the attention it did Tom Cruise. Many critics were skeptical whether or not the pretty boy of RISKY BUSINESS and TOP GUN fame had what it took to portray a real life Vietnam veteran and make the audience believe he was that person.  Fans crowded into the theaters to watch Cruise's handsome face (which was not so attractive through most of the film).  Critics went to watch him blow the role.  But he proved himself and went above and beyond what was expected of him in one of the most moving performances I have ever seen.  He literally became Ron Kovic.Many people were affected by BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  It had great cinematography.  Its soundtrack was inspiring and beautiful, pulling out of the viewer all possible emotions.  Tom Cruise's performance as Ron Kovic blew almost everyone away.  In short, BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY has what it takes to be a great film.  It overcomes Stone's blatant manipulation of facts, such as the violent conflict that in the movie occurs during a republican convention, but in reality occurred during a democratic convention.  Powerful and touching, it drives its point home and back again, never missing a beat.8 out of 10 stars "},{"Title":"A moving story, told with some passion though suffering  from Stone's increasingly florid and overblown style...","Date":"29 May 2005","Score":"69 out of 103 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":" Everything that people love and detest about Oliver Stone's films is in full flower here&#151;ambitious theme, strengthen visual style, undisguised political biases&#133; The film is also an important turning point in Tom Cruise's career, completing his transformation from rising star to serious actor&#133; He received his first Academy Award nomination for his role as antiwar activist and Vietnam veteran&#133; Though Ron Kovic's story is presented as a distillation of the political and a violent social commotion that America went through from the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies...

Born on the Fourth of July is an absorbing piece of work, based on a true story, about Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a gung-ho Marine-turned-war-protester. We first meet Kovic as an all-American boy as strong in his faith as he is in his will to succeed. After high school he proudly joins the Marines, hoping he'll be shipped to Vietnam to stop the spread of communism. But the barbarities of war, including civilian casualties, friendly fire and a paralyzing bullet through the chest, gradually turn him against the conflict. Director Oliver Stone's method of telling Kovic's story over a period of several years is highly effective and convincing. Cruise is at his best as Kovic, portraying a wide range of emotions and developing apathy with the viewer. The audience feels what he feels, from confusion on the battlefield to the terror of being paralyzed from the waist down.Now for the bad news. The picture is overly political, with Stone once again (and unnecessarily) casting Republicans as the bad guys and Democrats as the good guys (seemingly ignoring that the Dems initially sent the troops to 'Nam). The film also takes a while to build up steam, and the all-American life of the pre-Marine Kovic seems a little too perfect to be believable. Obviously a story such as this requires adequate screen time, but the 145 minutes is slightly drawn out, particularly toward the end. And although one of its central themes is the opposition to the war that greeted returning vets, the genesis and rationale of that opposition are not adequately explored.As a whole, however, Born of the Fourth of July is recommended. Kovic's biography and Stone's masterful storytelling are a perfect match. It's not your typical war movie. In fact, it's not your typical movie, period.

Even after he returns home paralyzed from the waist down, he still feels that Vietnam is important and that if you do not support the fighting then you should leave America.  However, he has a change of heart and becomes an anti-war activist who realizes that one gets nothing out of combat but heartache and sorrow.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is pretty strong, but it is his unrelenting direction that makes the material work throughout.  Tom Cruise established himself as a high-class actor and the film stays above water because of that fact.  The lack of character support does impede the progress of the film though.  Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, and Kyra Sedgwick make somewhat token appearances and the impact of their screen-time is all minimal.  Cruise's character dominates the film.  This is both the film's strong point and weak point.  All in all a strong film, but could have been so much more.  4 out of 5 stars.

Having seen all manner of horrors, Ron is shot and wounded in the field and finds himself in a veterans hospital where he hopes to regain the use of his legs despite the advice of doctors. When he realises he will never walk again, it starts his mental collapse and he becomes increasing disillusioned with the country and he lost his legs for.There is nothing I dislike more than hearing uninformed people from other countries spouting about Northern Ireland so I'll be very careful about launching into any sort of preaching &#150; I'll leave that to Stone himself. It isn't that I don't want to know more it's just that I have so much to learn about my own culture and history that who has the time for wandering off to learn about America's! Anyway, there is no need for me to get on a soapbox because this film has a darn good go at doing it by itself. The basic plot is fine and very involving, mostly because it is a real person, not just a character but it weakens its impact by playing to the simplistic side of things. For example there is no question about Ron being a clean cut, shy boy, nor is there any complexity about how badly he is treated afterwards. In some regards this is fair enough but at times I wished that Stone had not been so strong in his sense of moral outrage because it doesn't give the subject the balance and subjectivity that it deserves to be presented with.This alone does not make it a bad film however, and it isn't ever bad &#150; just a touch heavy handed at points but it is very difficult to watch impassively and uninvolved. The film shows Kovic's collapse and gradual disillusionment really well in a way that stands for the mental and/or physical suffering of many vets who must have come back to find that the sacrifice they had made was not even supported by the vocal section of the populace. In a way, focusing on this one man makes for a story that is intimate but also has wider significance but in another way it means the film has to go into very specific areas that don't work so well. In particular I didn't think that Ron's Mexican trip worked that well and some aspects of his life were simply forgotten about (Donna?) and I wondered why they had even bothered to include them at all. Anyway, despite these comments the film still worked for me and it is an impacting story even if Oliver Stone is not the person I would have chosen to tell the story &#150; a very good director but 'non-partisan' is not a term that could ever be laid at his feet and at points this film gets a little sermonising as a result.A big factor in this film working is a superb performance by Cruise who was still, at this point, a clean cut poster boy and not the one I would have imagined taking this role! In the first of two performances that I believe he should have won an Oscar for (the other being SA for Magnolia), Cruise is very brave and very strong in the lead, convincingly taking us from a patriotic young boy to a injured soldier to a broken man to a man trying to put all the pieces together. Credit to both Cruise and the editor that this is done convincingly and without too many big jumps in character. Outside of Cruise though, nobody is really given a great deal of material to work with and all their characters are pretty two-dimensional and fleeting. If anything the support cast's main impact is to keep bringing well known faces to the screen; these include Barry, Sedgwick, Whaley, Baldwin (times two!), Dale Dye, Berenger, LeGros, Bob Gunton, Vivica Fox, Mike Starr (and brother), Dafoe, Sizemore, Eagle Eye Cherry, Wayne Knight and John C McGinley. Few of these have much to do but it is impressive how many faces there are that have since gone on to become well-known actors in their own right (I personally was surprised to see McGinley's only contribution being pushing a wheelchair or Fox being on screen (topless) for about 3 seconds with only one line) but this actually takes away from the film more than it gives now.Overall this is an impacting film but not a great one. The story has a few bits that don't really work and aren't delivered very well, while Stone's direction occasionally gets all preachy on us but, although the now all-star cast are not great, Cruise is superb and deals with the difficult role well.A very ambitious film and not one that manages to get it all right but still a film that is hard to ignore even if the same subject has been done better in other films.

Many Americans went deep into this deliberation when veterans like Ron Kovic went on record questioning the wisdom behind US's offensive against Vietnam. Regardless of historical outcome of the war, the question will haunt USA forever -was the Vietnam War a noble and just cause. Your answer could be anything depending upon your political and ideological preferences, but the reality of thousands who lost their lives and limbs continues to hurt.Oliver Stone's Born on Fourth of July - based on the true story of Ron Kovic - takes the audience through the triumph and trauma of a crusader who went from one side of the war debate to the other. Ron wanted to fight for his country and stop the evil force of communism dead in its tracks. He went to Vietnam to defend his nation but came back soon, injured and doomed to suffer further. In the inadequately equipped hospital, his dreamer instincts crashed against the harsh realities of political ambivalence, not for the first time though.Over next eight years that are depicted in this masterpiece, the character of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise with unprecedented brilliance) goes through the trauma of knowing that no one will love him now, that even his own sibling is not on the same side of ideology, that the government had more pressing issues than taking good care of war veterans, that his countrymen did not necessarily endorse of his view point. The reality that he killed a soldier from his own army, the reality that he was the unfortunate one to butcher children and women in Vietnam, the reality that he would not be able to father a child, the reality of his realization that his government had made a wrong case for the war - it all kept gnawing at his conscience. It kept gnawing him until he opened up to speak about what was wrong about this war. Thus 'ended' the patriotic fervor of a driven person, but he continued his passion as an antiwar activist.Born on Fourth of July may have been the story of one Ron Kovic, but there are many others whose sentiments would echo with this veteran's. At the end, there is no easy way out of this debate. War always comes with its baggage of pain, trauma and hurt. Whether Vietnam was a mistake or not - the arguments would go on forever. So would the history of people who aspired to be motivated by JFK's historical urge - Ask not what your country can do for you, See what you can do for your country - only to realize that in every war there is only one casualty - the human spirit. And this reality hurts. "},{"Title":"Yankee Doodle?

His movies always display a plethora of technical wizardry, rendering the artistry of cinema in its boldest colors. Indeed, so impressive is Oliver Stone as a showman that it is all too easy to overlook that many of the stories he tells range from the mediocre to (in this case) the horrid.Tom Cruise plays the famous Vietnam War-era Marine Ron Kovic; the man himself appears in a small role in the film. But I am surprised that Kovic would have wanted anything to do with the filmic adaptation of his book, considering how unflatteringly Cruise portrays him. As Kovic, Cruise proves to be deeply unlikable and often unintentionally funny. He (very poorly) takes a stab at Kovic's Long Island accent. He brays Love it or leave it! as if that were some magical mantra. By the time we see him and Willem Dafoe spitting on each other, I was laughing uncontrollably. I felt bad about laughing at what was ultimately a tragic story, but I didn't really consider it my fault. I put the blame on the director and (especially) on the actors, who look like sit-com stars being directed in an embarrassingly inept TV movie.All of this might have been forgivable if Stone had at least put some effort into the story, but his efforts are hit-or-miss at best. The script is riddled with historical errors, from Kovic's assertion that the North Vietnamese were fighting for independence (blatantly false) to the appearance of a rock singer belting out Rock Around the Clock in a Fourth of July parade taking place in 1956. (Was rock 'n' roll really socially acceptable enough then to be a theme in a small-town community parade? I think not.) Then, just to prove that he managed to stay awake in history class, Stone hammers home every 1960s trope he can remember from burning the flag to the Black Power movement to the supposed sexual repressiveness of suburban Americans, he misses no opportunity to play up the clichés. The fact that this movie won some Academy Awards tells me only that Hollywood will lavish honors on any half-baked historical epic as long as it's done with enough chutzpah.Is there anything at all good about BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY? Well, Stone does prove once again that he knows how to paint action-packed panoramas on the screen; his scenes of riots and firefights and parades are extravagant masterpieces, at least when taken on their own terms. But they have been put at the service of a story that plays out like a twisted satiric comedy. Mark my words you will feel ashamed to be an American after watching this, for it depicts us as profoundly delusional and dysfunctional and ultimately pathetic. It is a mystery to me why Stone, who professes to harbor so much fondness for American history, would go out of his way to squirt huge yellow gobs of macaroni at the Yankee Doodle Boy.

A young high school athlete, Ron Kovic, proud of his country and eager to do his duty in Vietnam enlists and rises to the rank of Sergeant after a couple of tours. However, on a patrol gone haywire, he accidentally shoots another Marine, and things begin to go downhill from their. He is later shot and is sent to a Veterans hospital and learns that he will now be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. His friends and family begins to treat him differently and his own friends abandon him as they fall victim to the pro-communist rhetoric that comes with the peace movement.This film is blatantly anti-war. Despite what others may say, this was Oliver Stone's intent. This is a man who, after September 11th said I think the revolt of September 11th was about 'F-- you! F-- your order Stone is a Vietnam Veteran and actually did more than one tour but said in his director's commentary in the Platoon DVD that the North Vietnamese Army were people who were fighting for their country, making it seem that they were reasonable people fighting for a truly righteous war and not as what they truly were, the sprouting tentacles of communism that was trying to spread like the plague throughout Asia. Something we were able to halt in Korea but too undermined from within by the anti-war movement to stop in Vietnam. His war films depict American servicemen as aggressive baby-killers who come from the lowest depths of society. Enough about Stone, let's address the movie's sole issue, Kovic's alienation.When Kovic comes back to the States, his friends practically ignore what he had done and ignore his personal suffering. When I say suffering, I'm not just talking about his paralysis. I'm also talking about his inner-suffering as he sees American flags being burned and even being harassed by hippies at a parade he attends in full dress uniform. Slowly, time passes and begins to believe that the government has abandoned him and wonders around until the end of the movie when he becomes an anti-war advocate, something he abhorred at the beginning of the film.If you want to see this movie, make sure you keep the director's intent in mind. Not all experiences in Vietnam were bad for every single Veteran. Most of the Vets I have met are proud of their service and don't regret enlisting. Do not listen to the folks here at IMDb that equate this movie with Iraq. Today, the commander-in-chief treats his servicemen with the utmost respect, something lacking 8 years prior to President Bush taking office. The government does its best to accommodate Veterans. Every now and then, things get messed and some things do get hidden by pencil-pushing bureaucrats, but it's not the black helicopter, cloak and dagger type stuff you see in the movies. Unlike what Born on the 4th of July implies, every servicemen is a hero because he takes on the selfless task of enduring harsh extremes and the violence of war when others are too cowardly to do the same. Pacifist inaction does not keep a country free, it's the armed servicemen that stand ready to do violence on those who threaten freedom.

Stone co-wrote the screenplay with Kovic himself, but judging from the presentation it's clearly an Oliver Stone project the film is visually and verbally bombastic, overwrought with clichés, dripping with sentiment, and weighed down by the director's usual battery of cosmetic effects. The combat sequences and VA hospital scenes carry moments of genuine impact, but elsewhere the film is saturated with artificial music cues, fancy camera angles, portentous slow motion effects, and more tight close-ups than the average made-for-TV movie. A measure of redemption is supplied by the high caliber acting of (surprise) Tom Cruise, but there's a limit to what even he can do when the life of an actual person is reduced to stereotype it's difficult to stretch him back to three credible dimensions again.

Well, I'll be the first to say that I don't think either film is very good.Born on the Fourth of July is about as subtle as you would expect it to be, which means it's not subtle at all. Stone is one of those directors who wants us all to feel bad about events that other people have lived through, and his way of ensuring that is to beat us over the heads with his films. It's a condescending attitude for a filmmaker to take, and it's responsible for pretty much making me shun Stone films to this day.Star Tom Cruise had proved to the world he could act the year before in Rain Man, and the Academy dutifully acknowledged that fact by handing him a Best Actor nomination for this film.

Some of Stone's other films, JFK, and Nixon, for example are very political as is Born on the Fourth of July, but Born on the Fourth of July handles the nature of the politics in this film much differently and explores both points of view on the given topic as the main character switches his stance on war gradually throughout the film.JFK, and Nixon, Oliver Stone's other political dramas both start out slow and start to lag in some areas, by means of slow pacing (strongly evident in JFK,) and poor character development (Nixon, even though America knows the real Nixon), but Born on the Fourth of July avoids these, which comes surprisingly to me considering it's an Oliver Stone film. The hues of color each scene was filmed in provides different feeling throughout the film instead of being left with the same feeling throughout the entire picture.Born on the Fourth of July is the story of real-life activist Ron Kovic, played by Tom Cruise, based on his book and his screenplay co-written with Stone. In the 60's in the midst of the Vietnam War, as a high schooler, the teenage Ron Kovic is sucked into becoming a U.S. Marine through lies and half-truths. When the Marine Kovic gets to Vietnam, he engages in battle with Vietmanese villagers which results in him accidentally killing on of his squad. However, the U.S. military fails to realized the accidental killing by Kovic, thus adding to the lies and half-truths of the military.It is in another battle where the real story of Ron Kovic begins to form. As he fights in another battle, Kovic signals men of his squad to come over when a bullet goes through the side of his chest severing the spinal cord and paralyzing him from waist down leaving him wheelchair bound for the rest of his life. It is in recovery in the mucky, filthy VA hospital where Kovic's strength and determination are put to the test-thorough the corruption of the doctors, and the neglect of the workers, and further injuries to his legs.When he comes home, finds his life is completely changed, but yet, his entire family is changing their lives to help him more, but his younger brother, a teen against the war, outrages Kovic for going against his (Kovic) beliefs, saying the war is wrong. Over the course of several years, through ups and downs, Ron slowly realized the sin of war and he becomes an activist. This is just summarizing it up quickly though.Kira Sedgewick, gives a satisfactory performance, but one that wouldn't have have made much of an impact if it weren't included. Willem DaFoe's performance is one that could have been edited out without any harm to the story line seeing as he is only in the film for what seemed like twenty minutes. It is for these unnecessary roles that don't give this movie a ten.Born on the Fourth of July is movie different from other war/activist films and is one that should be appreciated for years to come.

Tom Cruise, continuing his move away from teenage heart-throb, plays the lead character whom we follow from fresh-faced youth, to frontline soldier in Vietnam, to hospitalised patient, right through to embittered wheelchair bound protestor.'Born on the 4th of July' revolves around Kovic to such a degree that any flaws in the characterisation would be fatal. It is some achievement that Cruise more than pulls off the part and, despite the straggly stuck-on moustache, never fails to convince. Supporting performances are universally good, without the story or script requiring them to particularly stand out.Praise aside, the film doesn't achieve the epic status it strives for and it was no real surprise that it lost out on the Best Picture Oscar to 'Driving Miss Daisy' - in similar circumstances 'Apocalypse Now' was beaten by 'Kramer vs Kramer' 19 years earlier. Comparisons with Coppola's masterpiece are a mismatch however - 'Apocalypse Now' is clearly the superior effort. To be fair 'Born on the 4th of July' doesn't try and cover similar ground, but herein lies the problem. I'm not sure what ground Stone and Kovic were hoping to cover and whether the methods employed played strictly by the rules.It appears to be a hard-hitting anti-war film, criticising the very fabric of America in the late 60's. The audience is lulled into this premise, the effect heightened with disturbing scenes to make sure the point is rammed home - Vietnamese women and children are accidentally killed by US soldiers; Cruise is left lying wounded on a stretcher, given his last rites; the hospital back in America is a sordid, filthy hell-hole etc. These images are in our face, so we unwittingly embrace the film as being highly critical of the circumstances behind the story it is telling. The problem is that 'Born on the 4th of July' isn't an anti-war film, it is a propaganda film. The story takes the angle of naive youth being drawn into horrific events because of a blind adoration for the Stars & Stripes and Mom's Apple Pie. Despite the pain which then had to be endured, by the end we are celebrating the resilience of the all-American boy who has come through with his personal values intact. The system may have been rotten around the time of Vietnam, but the people and their beliefs were to be celebrated. The concluding atmosphere is of hope and light, with a stronger America emerging from the dark in a new blaze of glory and jingoism. After seeing the film, spotty teenagers are more likely to grab those Marine enrollment applications again - this is why the film is very subtle and clever in its underlying message.'Born on the 4th of July' hits all the right notes and is rightly acclaimed for this - I'm just not sure that the notes it aims for are as wholesome as they first appear. The excellent music by John Williams is perhaps the final giveaway - its just a little too rousing at every key scene, trying to make us react like Pavlovian dogs whenever the high notes are struck. Like everyone else I salivated at all the right times, but afterwards I found a sour taste in my mouth.

But who does Liberal extremist filmmaker Oliver Stone pick on in the film? Nixon, the Republican, of course! Who else?Stone, like most of his contemporaries, will never make a Democrat look bad but Nixon - oh, man, he's the Liberal's favorite target....until GWB came along. Stone, like Michael Moore, just looks the other way when it comes to unimportant little things such as facts.Who better to costar in an anti-Vietnam movie than Hanoi Jane Fonda? She must have done this role for free, relishing a Leftist propaganda opportunity like this! Unlike Fonda, who at least cooled her rhetoric a decade later, Stone seemed obsessed by Vietnam for years. He was still at it in 1986 with Platoon. He still obsesses over every Liberal cause, like a conspiracy under every rock. Sadly, like Moore, Stone has the power and finances to inflict all his prejudices on the public in the form of movies.....and people what they see on screen.For every Ron Kovic, the main subject of the film and a real-life guy who turned out to be a very bitter ex-soldier, there are thousands of military heroes who are proud to have represented the U.S.A. in Southeast Asia and have no regrets for doing so, but filmmakers like Stone will never do stories about them. Kovic, by the way, was wounded on his second tour. He was awarded medals for bravery. If he won a dozen medals but did not turn out to be an anti-war spokesman, you would have never heard of him. Hollywood and the media only glorify the left side of the political spectrum.Casting Tom Cruise in the lead was a good idea. Most people can't stand him in real life, so playing a nagging whiner for much of the three hours made him easy to dislike.Stone is a capable, knowledgeable filmmaker who isn't afraid to try different techniques (witness the unpleasant but fascinating Natural Born Killers.). However, his films would so much better if he could just control putting so much of his own political Republican-hating agenda into every one of them, this one included.

We could all share the experiences of Ron Kovic, and this picture can serve as a reminder of the brutality and futility that war can bring upon human beings even years after the movie was made and will continue to do so in the years to come.I have to say that Ron Kovic is extremely courageous human being and though he has lost so much of the joyous side that life can bring and suffered tremendously through not necessarily no fault of his own, he has made a greater impact than he would have done otherwise by deciding to share his life story with us. God will judge him and even be appreciative for what he has done for the others.National pride can have effective results but is ultimately evil because by believing in that you automatically create another adversary, that You are not one of us.So many people get naturalised into citizens of countries where they are not originally from, in the twenty first century romantic patroiticism must be considered evil and imposes an adverse effect in evolutionary process as a whole.Tom Cruise's delivers one of the greatest performances of his life, well at least that's before he'd gone nuts.I also like Willem Dafoe's performance as a paralysed vet, he is one of the gifted actors of our generation.In short if you join a war to kill other human beings there is just likely possibility that you will get killed too.

However, in my opinion, for the above poster to see no redeemable value in this film whatsoever, is a pitiful remark of one's unfamiliarity with facts and unawareness about history. Prior to Platoon, Oliver Stone may not have done a great job directing this movie. But Born on the Fourth of July is THE kind of film that had to be made for the story had to be told - what the Vietnam War did to people, in this case the main protagonist, Ron Kovic, was devastating. The wounded or suffered were innumerable. Thousands and thousands of Vietnam-war veterans were permanently scarred, physically and psychologically, and they found it difficult to return to civilian society, while Ron Kovic was just one of many who were guilt-ridden about their role in the war, paralyzed, and suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.

His transformation, downward spiral and consequent salvation are handled with masterful strokes by Oliver Stone.

The fire of their rage only fueled by the apathetic Nixon administration calling upon it's silent majority to endorse his war tactics whilst ignoring the cry of the returning soldiers.As a film it strays somewhat from the book it was based on and there are events depicted that were completely fabricated but overall the feeling of innocence lost come across well. The low and tight camera angles used to heighten the claustrophobia when Ron returns home in his wheelchair is a clever cinematic devise. The performance of the actors in this film are believable and true to the area the story is set in.I urge people to read Ron Kovic's book as well as seeing this film.

In a few years Americans lost their faith in all powers politics, religion and people victims just of an image war, with no sense. 3) Europe entered no wars after 1948, but the US people still love to look at CNN for the newest war, just as watching a soap opera. Maybe most of them don't really realize it's real, with real people and children dying. 4) Nietsche said There is no war without a reason and added The reason is always the financial interest of a powerful political minority. Of course the IRAQ war is an exception, as the US want to export democracy, but actually I've never ever seen a single weapon of mass destruction. 5) The victims are always American and other nations dead people or people whose life will never be the same, for heavy wounds and psychological turmoil, without assistance, all life long. 6) This movie shows the US as the worst 3rd World country, when Bronx hospital is portrayed as a Bangladesh public hospital, where funds are not enough for Vietnam and people who served the country are left there to die, without any kind of assistance. 7) The main message is Who cares about them and there is even a Republicn convention sending Vietnam Veterans to jail, just because they dared to express their opinion. 8) Today the US does exactly the same wars, this time for the sake of oil and arms usage. It's a shame this time people do not protest, where has the end of '60s protest spirit gone? . Instead they voted this mentally retarded president not only once but TWICE. 9) In Italy, where I live, the Constitution says Italy repudiates war, so this is why we did not take part to the massacre of children, women and citizens, even though the US started without the authorization of the United Nations. 10) Germany, France, Spain and all other EU countries did never take part to your wars, maybe believing peace is not just a word. 11) A film that makes you think, about the US brainwashing in serving the country (or maybe just serving the powerful lobbies) and about the myth of the land of the free where people are treated worse than animals in the Bronx Hospital after they served their country. 12) I would recommend watching Sacco and Vanzetti to see how the US Courts are able to kill people just for their ideas... is this the land of the free?I hope this movie will make you think beyond the TV brainwashing and that any war needs to be contrasted just like we do in Europe.

Sadly, America's head got way too big from the WWs, and even though Korea was a bust, there was still enough patriotism to fool more men to go fight a no-win war. Thankfully, there were protesters, or people who stood up and questioned what was force-fed us.I'm getting a little political here, or, more accurately, anti- political, but that's this movie. I just happen to agree with it. Miserably, a lot of the same politics play today with more brainwashing and mercifully, there are still people who will stand up against the fear mongers. I digress. Very good movie and you shouldn't wait 25 years to see this. See it now.

Though the film is closely based on a true story, it also functions as a rather obvious metaphor for the rapid transition of America's public attitude from the happy-go-lucky family values of the '50s to the conspiratorial uncertainty of the early '70s. At the time this was something of a reach for Cruise, who was only just starting to branch out into serious roles, and the strong performance opened up new horizons for his career. His acting shines, especially in the dark, depressing pits to which his character eventually sinks, but the storyline could use some smoothing. Almost overnight Kovic's attitudes about his country spin 180-degrees, swapping one extreme perspective for another just minutes after he's shouted down his younger brother over the kitchen table for doing the same thing. An awkward almost-love-story is shoehorned into his character arc, then disappears around the middle of the picture and never resurfaces. It's a passionate rallying cry for the cause of the railroaded, confused Vietnam vets who were punished for doing what they thought was the right thing, but despite several strong performances from its cast it's needlessly long and routinely uneven.

Based on a true story, the acclaimed film follows the young Kovic from a zealous teen who eagerly volunteers for the Vietnam War, to an embittered veteran paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Deeply in love with his country, Kovic returned to an environment vastly different from the one he left, and struggled before emerging as a brave new voice for the disenchanted. If Platoon (1986) took you to Vietnam, this film will take you home. It's a tremendous, multi-award winning film for Kovic, Stone, and Cruise. Self-described pro-soldier advocates have claimed Vietnam War protesters were anti-veteran - which seemed illogical. Herein, they are interested in the individuals' Vietnam War support, not service - which seems logical. Of the many powerful scenes, the one with Kovic finally confessing to an incident of friendly fire may be the film's greatest moment; although it didn't happen in real life; it perfectly illustrates the film's overriding thesis The Truth Shall Make You Free. ********* Born on the Fourth of July (12/20/89) Oliver Stone ~ Tom Cruise, Willem Dafoe, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J.

If you've only seen Platoon (1986), then put simply you missed the return home. The film focuses on the horror of not just the war, but what it really entailed to bring it home with you. Like Platoon, one of the movie's golden features is its stunning cast.If you're a Cruise fan or not, here he is undeniably great. He portrayed the grueling state of post-combat rehabilitation, the tragedy of discovering everything you've fought for is a lie and quite brilliantly how easy it is to inadvertently become a propaganda-believing automaton. You feel his pain, but more importantly his disillusionment. The rest of the cast and production team do well to re-create the turmoil of the era, capturing civil unrest as the displacement of the returning veterans. The most striking thing to me is how no movie doesn't hold back at all, and can be pretty brutal emotionally on the characters, of course only painting a picture of how brutal the real world really is. Raymond J. Barry and Caroline Kava do exceptionally well and oh did I mention Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger manage to co-star as well? You can't top that quite frankly. Adding to all this is a glorious composition of music by none other than John Williams.The film boasts nightmarish visuals, an incredible score and a true sense of the times.

Stone's films usually are so strong that when they enter the mass market the ripples are large, his messages often creating feverish backlash. Few are left on the fence and like Michael Moore's films, they are polarizing, entertaining, often jarring and disturbing. Stone is a man who was in Viet Nam and saw it all up close. As such he was well suited to comment on the war and comment he did over several excellent films. Ron Kovic's story was an appropriate addition to Stone's collection of 'Nam films, coming as it did only three years after his seminal Platoon.There have been many Vietnam war films made and this film is certainly one of the most moving I've seen. It is always tempting to get drawn into clichés about war, using stereotypes as a replacement for depth in writing and insight. Stone is a fine writer and director. Along with Kovic's own words and experience, this film manages to honor the appropriate focus, which is Kovic's journey into a drama that began as a patriotic desire to do the right thing. What is remarkable about Kovic's journey is how much he matures in such a short time and how he managed to change his mind about a war that he volunteered to enter. Like so many of his generation, he was initially convinced that Viet Nam was a far flung battle between American style freedom and lifestyles and the oppressive and expanding web of communism. That these ideas were a leftover of the anxieties and illusions of the Cold War was not apparent at that time. In fact one could honestly say that America had not really admitted how lost it was in Indochina until an aged and contrite Robert McNamara recently wrote how his generation of leaders had been completely wrong about Vietnam. There has not been a more socially divisive war since Vietnam and it's hard to argue that there will be one again. Coming as it did as a huge change in society evolved, the war became the ultimate metaphor for all that was wrong with the American vision. Gone were the halcyon days of the American's as liberators, beloved in lands across the world as World War 2 ended. Now the nightly news showed atrocities with American soldiers as the perpetrators. Kovic's tour of duty shadowed all of these changes. His treatment by an underfunded and somewhat indifferent veterans hospital only added to the process of disillusionment and bitterness that was to lead him to completely transform his attitudes towards the war. That he was abused, spat at and beaten by those who would not listen to his anti-war words finalized and crystallized his transformation from soldier to anti-war activist. All of this came at a huge cost to himself.Whoever said Tom Cruise was not a great actor should see this film. Consider that he was all of 27 years old when the film was released and watch how brave his performance was. His ability to travel from starry eyed child of the 50's, his head full of the previous generations glory at bringing liberation to millions, his belief that communists were the evil empire, all the way through purgatory into realizing that there was no truth to this vision. Cruise gives a stupendous and raw performance, holding back nothing, tearing open his emotions to reveal the depth of Kovic's spiral into total despair.Ah, then there is Willem Dafoe. His character, so completely destroyed by the ravages of what he had done as a soldier, so aflame in self loathing and grief, he can no longer even recognize that Kovic is a mirror image. The scene of them spitting on each other, wrestling each other out of their wheelchairs is so tragically upsetting that one wants to avert the eyes to see such pain.This is a film to watch several more times. If there are finer essays on the loss of dreams, the transformation of America into a frightening military powerhouse, equally as intimidating and dangerous as they themselves feared the Russians were, than I do not know of it. There is much in this film to consider and given our current state of yet another American disaster (Iraq and Afghanistan), a film that has not aged one drop. A triumph for Stone, Kovic, Cruise and Defoe.

How does a nation cope with a war it did not want to fight and how does she respect the men and women who made the sacrifices she does not recognize, or at least does not want to know or care about? Stone's direction is fantastic, as is Richardson's cinematography. Stone's films haven't been the same since Richardson went on to become Scorcese's favorite man behind the lens. Cruise is very good, but never looses his pretty boy charisma, which does not help him this time around.

The Vietnam war was a tragedy and Oliver Stone's film portrayed it in a very important way which should have made everyone very reluctant to pursue a similar military conflict. Now, many years after the war in Vietnam, the world is experiencing the war in Iraq (In spite of what Bush says, it's still an ongoing war). The message in Born on the Fourth of July needs to be retold, either by re-releasing the film or newly made to relate to Iraq. Although I am not an American (some of my family are and one of my brothers and his family has emigrated to the U.S.), every day I think about the agony and misery that Americans are going through in Iraq and in the U.S. for a war which is supposed to be about liberation and democracy but has turned out to be otherwise.

And in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, he gives us another man's view of the war, like Stone a soldier who had become disenfranchised by the war.The man at the center of this true-life story is Ron Kovic, a Marine who believed in the myths of American might, the honor of serving one's country, John Wayne, and the threat that communism posed.  But in a firefight on a Vietnamese beach during Tet, Kovic was shot by a VC bullet and paralysed from the waist down.  As a result, he would never be able to walk again and would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  Even worse, when he returned from Vietnam, his rehabilitation was painful, and so was his coming to terms with the fact that many of his friends in his hometown of Massapequa, New York had grown either indifferent or hostile to him.  Once a love-it-or-leave-it patriot, Kovic came to realize he could be a force for Good by protesting what the Vietnam war had done, not only to his fellow servicemen but to America.This is what is at the heart of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and Stone (with help from Kovic, who collaborated with the director on the screenplay, which was based on his 1976 memoir) brings all the memories back of those traumatic years in American history.  Tom Cruise gives a fine performance as Kovic.Even more so, Stone does the right thing by debunking a lot of dangerous myths about America's anti-communist paranoia and our worshipping of John Wayne.  Unlike a previous reviewer of this film, I am of the belief that America never fully understood communism as anything more than a threat to itself, and our inability to see beyond that surface to its inherent weaknesses is what led us to the utter tragedy of Vietnam.  Furthermore, basing our patriotism on an actor like John Wayne, who NEVER served his country in reality, also turned out to be part of the recipe for disaster.BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, in my opinion, is NOT an Anti-American film but a film fundamentally about the loss of human innocence.  It does not make service to one's country dishonorable.  But it does rightly destroy those myths that destroyed our innocence as a nation in the 1960s and 1970s.  And on those counts alone, it is an American masterpiece.

After watching the film the first time, I came out disliking it, too long and boring.  But I caught the film on HBO, and after seeing it a second time, my opinion has changed. It's not a great war film, but to be honest it's not as much a war film as it is the story of one man.  That man is played by Tom Cruise (Rainman, Jerry Maguire).  Cruise plays Ron Kovic in this real-life story.  Cruise plays a young man who enlists for Vietnam and comes back paralyzed from wounds he suffered.  The scenes in Vietnam are haunting and perfectly done. Cruise comes back to friends who have started normal lives, a family that has missed him, and people who yell at him for going to Vietnam. Initially, Cruise gets along with his family, but soon his views begin to change on Vietnam, he changes from pro-war to anti-war and alienates his family with some of his actions and after spending some time in Mexico he becomes one of the biggest anti-war protestors.  The film is still too long, but I found myself compelled by the story so much more the second time.  I am a Tom Cruise fan, not only does he make great movies, but I feel he is one of the better actors in Hollywood.  This is by far his best performance.

Or take a look at the carefully edited TV documentaries that influenced a generation (Victory at Sea, Crusade in Europe, et al.), or the innocuous, de-politicized TV series of the time (Ozzie and Harriet, The Ed Sullivan Show et al.). Or consider how quickly that forgotten war in Korea really was forgotten. In brief, the Cold War culture of those 15 years created a Ron Kovic generation that had no reference point beyond a sanitized framework filled only with uncritical images of America and its past. How surprising is it, then, that thousands of us of that generation learned our politics the hard way.The movie shows in painful detail the price Kovic paid for his eager willingness to believe. It's a harrowing story, to say the least. But then, how prepared were any of those teen-age grunts to understand that Vietnam was not WWII. How prepared were they to understand the anti-occupation struggle of the Vietnamese was one they had been fighting for decades. There was nothing in American popular culture to prepare them for those realities. For to do so would have required questioning whether we were really the biggest and the best, or whether those terms should even apply. That's why Kovic must break with the past in order to regain a semblance of mental health. It even requires breaking with a mother and father too innocent to understand. Perhaps they can reconcile later on. In the meantime, Kovic and those around him will have to accept that he is now a different man who no longer fits in the way he did.It's a wrenching and well-done film, showing how wars of empire are really fought. But more importantly, it's a beneficial warning to those who would go thousands of miles away to a strange land to fight a politician's war.

Cruise's style lends itself well to a character that has one enduring passion that does not diminish in intensity, but does change focus (the strength of purpose is just as strong as he explains to his father why he must go to war as when he denounces the conflict to reporters at the Republican convention).As for Stone he adroitly avoids trying to parlay the `period piece' aspect of the film, and instead concentrates on the bitter ironies (a friend gives the recently paralyzed Kovic some trite business advice `you've got to walk before you can run') and adumbrations (a man brags that his family has participated in all that nations wars and will continue to as the camera shows his grandson).  And by keeping the actual Vietnam combat footage in perspective with the whole of Kovic's experience he avoids making `Platoon II' (not an easy feat by the way considering that Tom Beringer and Willem Defoe play key roles in the movie, and some other  cast members of Stone's previous Vietnam epic sneak in and out of scenes)  "},{"Title":"An outstanding character piece","Date":"12 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":"  This is one of the few films that successfully takes a character through many subtle but significant incidents that lead to a total change in the character's attitude and feelings. To believably change a person from one attitude to another in the course of a film is a monumental task. So much of it is told in subtext - the emotional undertow of the scene - the dialogue is realistic and tells us exactly how a character feels without having to spoonfeed us. The scene where Ron returns home for the first time after being paralyzed is one of the best examples of this. The use of the recurring theme by John Williams brings the audience right into the soul of Kovic as he struggles to overcome the guilt of having killed a fellow soldier, his inner need to prove he's a man to his mother, and his struggle with friends who don't see the world the way he does.

Upon his return to the United States, Kovic became a vocal anti-war protester whose military record gave him more credibility than the numerous hippies and college students whom critics lambasted for dodging service to their country. Born on the Fourth of July is divided neatly into four pieces. The first, which transpires entirely in Massapequa, New York between the late 1950s and 1964, traces the childhood of Kovic, who grows up in a fiercely patriot household. His parents are fierce supporters of the country and devout Roman Catholics.Kovic, inspired by a presentation given by a Marine , signs up out of high school and is on his way to Vietnam by December 1965, leaving behind his family and his girlfriend. This segment is filmed by Stone with an abundance of nostalgic elements. The lighting and colors hint at a time- clouded innocence. The style, which evokes Capra, is overly romantic. Stone is, of course, setting us up. He wants us to buy into this idealized, insulated way of life in order for what comes after to have maximum impact.The in country portion of the film is the shortest. It picks up the action in October 1968, when Kovic, now a sergeant and well-respected member of his platoon, is in his second tour of duty. While on patrol, an error in the received intelligence leads to a civilian massacre, and Kovic is shaken. During the retreat, he mistakes one of his men for an enemy and accidentally kills him. The XO exonerates Kovic, ignoring his claims of friendly fire, and informs the sergeant that things like this happen in the confusion of battle. Three months later, Kovic is seriously wounded in another engagement - an incident that ends his battlefield involvement in the war. Stone's approach to the fight segments are similar to those in Platoon - short, brutal, and unflinching. He is more interested in showing the bloody, inglorious elements of war as opposed to those promoted in military recruiting films.Kovic's rehab at the Bronx V.A. hospital is perhaps the most disconcerting episode in the film, depicting as it does the deplorable conditions that existed in the government-run facilities established to treat injured soldiers. Paralyzed from the waist down, Kovic does his best to maintain a positive mental attitude and is obsessive About rehabbing, despite his surroundings. Drugs are rampant in the hospital, rats wander freely and the equipment is old. Eventually, he leaves the hospital and returns to Massapequa, where he is hailed as a hero. The final hour is devoted Kovic's change from war-supporter to rabid anti-war activist. When Kovic initially returns home, he is still a defender of the action in Vietnam. It's only after attending an anti-war rally that he changes his position. The thing best accomplished by Born on the Fourth of July is its contrasting of the glorious illusion of war as seen from thousands of miles away to the barbarity of it up-close. Kovic's change in perspective becomes the filter through which we view Vietnam. His gradual disillusionment with the government and the military is given weight because of events in his life. He is credible because he has been involved in activities that many pro- war and anti-war activists have seen only from afar.When Stone made this movie in 1988-89, he was looking back roughly 15 years; the intervening time has served only to sharpen the focus. Nothing about Born on the Fourth of July is dated; it remains an involving tale of innocence lost and of war and its unintended consequences.

Yes he can be pretentious but he has this undeniable talent of bringing the message home and making you feel every minute of it. That being said, believe it or not, I don't think I've ever seen all of Platoon which is usually considered the ultimate 'Nam movie. It's definitely on my list of films to see and soon. However if Platoon is the ultimate 'Nam movie than Born On The Fourth of July could be considered the ultimate follow up to the world the Vietnam vets returned to. The film literally goes from before the battlefield, to the brutality of the battlefield and Vietnam situations to the aftermath facing all vets when they return and in particular one very patriotic and determined man who loses everything in Vietnam. The film is not only brilliantly written and directed thanks in big part to a very close personal and creative relationship with Ron Kovic (who's story this is) but an absolutely mind blowing performance by it's lead star. So many moments in this film will make you feel emotion and anger and patriotism in a way that few films have ever done and probably only Oliver Stone could do with such incredible gusto.If you have ever wondered or doubted where Tom Cruise's Hollywood legend status came from just sit down and watch Born On The Fourth of July. He was absolutely robbed of an Academy Award playing this bold and moving and completely incredible performance as wounded veteran Ron Kovic. His character goes through such huge changes emotionally, physically and just in life. He starts as an eager High School graduate to a leader on the battlefield to this emotionally wrecked veteran to a man who speaks for his beliefs and Tom Cruise nails the role and you can just see the intense work and drive he put into this role. Definitely one of his best!! This film is truly all about Kovic and everyone else is a supporting cast member but it's a strong cast. Raymond J. Barry as his loving but devastated father, does a good job, Caroline Kava is really brilliant as Kovic's religiously fanatic mother, and Frank Whaley gives a moving performance as Kovic's boyhood friend who also returns from 'Nam mentally sick.I believe right now, if I could political for just a moment that Vietnam films are very pertinent right now to our current war situations around the world. That being a very unpopular war but this is a really moving film about a man who believed in what he was doing and slowly became aware of what he was facing when he returns home. The film will bring you to tears it's just an incredible over the top emotional powerhouse of a film and it feels like Stone just lets Cruise do his thing and Cruise has this powerhouse performance that is just mind blowing. The direction on the battlefield is brilliant and disturbing and very gritty and the numerous scenes of protest are brilliantly done by Stone and his crew. I can't recommend this film enough for many reasons but if you want something moving then this will make you realize how powerful films can be. Oliver Stone is an amazing director and this film is a perfect example of what he can do with a cast and with a camera.

This time Stone confronts us with the shocking affect the war had on its veterans, by telling us the true story of Ron Kovic, a young man who joined the marines in order to get an opportunity to serve his country in the war, and stop the insipid communist regime.Oliver Stone, who again won best director at the Academy Awards for this film, delivers yet another powerful and emotional drama about the atrocities of Vietnam, atrocities that even followed the young men back to the United States. Once again the production is technically impressive and very convincing, and John Williams provides a truly haunting score, which is both disturbing and uplifting in its own right. The fabulous acting performances are probably the films strongest point, with Raymond J. Barry, Frank Whalley, Jerry Levine and both Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger (also in Platoon) lending fine back up to Tom Cruise, whose honest and passionate portrayal of the shattered Kovic is magnificent, the role of a lifetime for this previously unproven actor.Stone's movie of Ron Kovic's novel is only fractionally less effective than Platoon, perhaps due to its marginal over length and the fact that it is not as brilliantly focused as its predecessor, as it covers a much broader range of topics that related to the war. Yet still this is a film that will surely infuriate you, and move you.Wednesday, January 26, 1994 - VideoOliver Stone's obsession with the Vietnam war continues in Born on the Fourth of July as he shifts his focus from what Vietnam did to the soldiers to what the United States did to its veterans.Ron Kovic's touching autobiographical novel is the subject matter on which Stone bases his harrowing, disturbing screen play (co-written by Stone and Kovic) about young Kovic's blind pro-war patriotism which turns into a strong anti-war passion after he returns from Vietnam paralysed and disillusioned.The film's strongest point is its performances from an impressive cast including Raymond J. Barry, Caroline Kava, Jerry Levine, Kyra Sedgwick, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger and an outstanding Tom Cruise who gives us a powerhouse showing, first as the gung-ho young marine ready to take on the world, then as the confused and angry vet questioning the very ideals on which he was brought up.The splendid production values that were evident in Platoon return again, with Robert Richardson back behind the camera to deliver some splendid 'Nam pics, Bruno Rubeo again in charge of Art Direction, while new editor David Brenner does a creditable job and John Williams scores an emotionally rousing piece of music.Again Stone proves himself a confronting controversialist, and one who was obviously deeply disturbed himself by the upheaval that so devastated the American people and the entire world in the turbulent 60's. As an accompaniment to 1986's best picture Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July is a worthy piece of cinema, and though not as brilliantly or deliberately focused as its powerful predecessor, it is a haunting reminder of one of the greatest tragedies of our too often fallible kind, war!Thursday, October 6, 1994 - Video "},{"Title":"Stone and Cruise make this movie one to remember","Date":"17 August 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":" The first thing that I thought while watching this movie is that not that much has changed since the Vietnam war. Today too there are a lot of young American idealistic men who join the military, because they are in a hopeless situation when it comes to finding a job, because they constantly hear, read and see that only a soldier is the true hero of the nation or just because they are hoping to win some medals without thinking of all the possible consequences. Today the war isn't situated in Vietnam anymore, but Afghanistan and Iraq aren't all that different. Both wars are just as endless and impossible to win, whether they like to hear that or not. The only difference is that this time there is almost no-one who protests against it.Born on the Fourth of July tells the story of Ron Kovic. As a young man who is about to graduate from high school, who's good at sports, who's willing to fight for his country against the communists and who wants to make a difference in the world, the offer to become a US Marine is about everything he could dream of. After his military training, he is immediately sent to Vietnam. When they approach a village, everything appears to be quiet and peaceful at first. But little do they know that they are about to get trapped in an ambush. While running for their lives, one of his comrades is shot - Kovic is convinced that he did it - and soon after he too gets hit by a bullet. Once in hospital he finds out that he will be paralyzed for the rest of his life. While trying to deal with his handicap, he becomes more and more convinced that America never should have gone to war in Vietnam in the first place...Personally I didn't have any problem with it, because I'm anti-war myself (even though I'm not a lefty as so many of you will probably think), but I'm convinced that too many people will see some ultra-left anti war propaganda in it. Personally I don't think that was what Oliver Stone had in mind. I believe that he wanted to show that many young men go to war with the idea that they will do an honorable job by defending their country, but once they have returned to that same country, they realize that what they did wasn't always that honorable and the leaders of the country couldn't care less for their pain and trauma's. And let's be honest, were they heroes because they came back from Vietnam? I don't think so. Does that mean they all should have died back there? Certainly not, but are you a hero when you do your job? No you're not. The only difference is that they do it because some president sends them. Once they return (in a body bag or not doesn't really matter), they aren't all that important anymore. But by the time that they realize this, it's already too late. Personally I really appreciate that message and I hope that it might make some guys think twice. It's perhaps the only counter weight left in a balance that is dominated by nothing else but pro war propaganda. Or how would you call the fact that the Bush administration didn't even allow that photographs or other images from the coffins that returned from Iraq and Afghanistan were shown? They didn't want a second public rebellion against their war. But enough about politics, hidden messages and stuff like that. Let's talk about the acting, the directing,... I guess most people will agree with me that this is not only a very fine war movie thanks to the story, but also thanks to the great acting from Tom Cruise. This was one of his best performances ever - he has had some other great roles like for instance in Magnolia, but they were almost never as big as in this movie - and lifted this movie to a higher level. The other actors were interesting to watch as well, but if it hadn't been for Cruise, this movie might have gone by pretty much unnoticed. Most of them aren't famous at all and the name Oliver Stone wouldn't have been enough to convince the audience, although the man certainly knows what good (war) movies should look like. Just watch Platoon, JFK, ... yes even U Turn and Natural Born Killers, if you don't believe me. The problem with Stone is that so many people seem to take all his movies so personal. Somehow a lot of people don't seem to understand him or see him as too left and therefor uninteresting. All in all this is a very powerful war movie with an excellent Tom Cruise and some very fine directing from Oliver Stone. I already liked Heaven & Earth and loved Platoon. Well, I place this one right in the middle of the two when it comes to the rating. I give this movie an 8/10.

It's a tribute to Cruise that his performance makes this transformation so believable, and it is this film more than any other in which he removes any lingering doubts about his talent as an actor.The film is somewhat let down by uneven pacing. A lengthy set-up is followed by a brief sequence of actual fighting in Vietnam, in which Kovic is paralysed. There then follows a sequence in which he struggles to recuperate and come to terms with his disability. Most of the rest of the film shows him becoming increasingly disillusioned, and alienating everyone who tries to help him cope with his disability.Not until the very end does Kovic realise he has something to live for, and re-invents himself as an anti-war protester. Because the film spends so long focusing on Kovic's bitterness, it doesn't leave enough time to explore his redemption. For this reason the film isn't quite rounded enough, but it still provides an important indictment of the Vietnam War, seen through the eyes of one man.

The images are incredible as well, exhilarating and haunting, a beautiful counterpoint of American triumph and the terror of Vietnam and its anti-demonstrators. Stone's last film, Platoon, didn't work as well for me because it seemed to have a point but kept disguising it with a lot of hoopla.

Stone is often called one of the most critical filmmakers working today, and he is often put on the left side of the political spectrum, which is something that this film confirms pretty strongly. But one thing is not to be denied With all his critical attitude, he still is a patriot, and his films are very patriotic in a wider sense. I think Born on the Fourth of July is a good work, because it spends enough time establishing the characters, it helps us understand why young men are willing to risk their life in a war, for which they don't even know the reason. It's an accusation against a government who sends their citizens to a war, while telling lies about the true backgrounds (Once again history repeats itself in Iraq). In the end, I think, this movie became too much of a Hollywood success story, but nevertheless it is a very touching film with political and social commitment.

People keep telling me that the war in Iraq is a whole different issue, because this time, Americans were attacked on their native soil. But let me say that the same thing that happened to Ron Kovic is happening right now to other soldiers stationed in Iraq. And although many of them say that they believe in what they're doing, I still think that they finally will draw the same conclusion that Ron Kovic did. That they have been told lies about WMD and the good versus evil and that the war can't be won. If all the soldiers in Iraq or anywhere took what they're doing at face value, than they'd finally have to admit I shot at people because the corrupt government coaxed me into a war that's not going to do me any good but that is going to help these people wearing a tie and a suit getting richer and richer. I have to blame myself because I took the rifle and shot at people with it. The government may have talked me into it but I have to take full responsibility for letting myself being talked into this war. If I had known, if I had just known that nothing good will come of a person who chooses a gun over a conversation, a rifle over a flower, then today I wouldn't be this person pent up with anger and hatred.

In the beginning there is a line a mother says to her boy with a crazy smile as they are watching TV I had a dream, Ronnie, the other night, that you were speaking to a large crowd just like him&#x85;just like him, and you were saying great things! And in the background a wondrous orchestral theme is playing. Now that particular line does pay off eventually, but large parts of the movie are like that artificial and full of pomp and cheese, all for the sake of the message.That music keeps on coming back and it is always either the adventurous tune from every children's adventure movie ever or else the saddest tragedy tune. It really affects the mood of the movie and is one of the few movie scores that is persistently noticeable. This music on its own is good but in the film it is a major contributor to that cheesy feeling as it helps push the anti-war meaning.It is as if a hippie tried to do an anti-war movie and tried to stay respectful and tasteful. He thinks he is but he still can't help but push his point through in every scene.This brings me to another issue related to its pushy point the issue with content variety. Of course a movie should have a point, but everything in this movie is about war is bad. We see the young hero of the film being a promising young man and the rest of the film we spend watching the negative effects of war on him. Almost everything is related to that. Just pick a scene. Is war still bad? Yup, it is still bad. And how about this scene, what is the mood of this scene? War is bad. Even in the beginning, before the main character experiences war, the obvious music and themes remind you that war will be bad. It is only towards the end of the movie that something more positive and meaningful starts coming through but this is a long movie and you have to wait a while for that pay-off.This movie makes me appreciate The Thin Red Line more. That is another movie with an anti-war message but it is much more subtle. Born on the Fourth of July, just like its title, is not.Having said that, there is a point and a good structure to support it. Things seeded earlier in the story grow fruits later on. The progression in the main character and the change in his beliefs feels realistic and well-spread over the course of the film. There is also a good side to the movie being obvious, namely that it is clear and easy to grasp. Raw and dirty scenes may be forced in the viewer's face, but on the other hand the movie has interesting raw and dirty scenes that give the film texture.On top of that, the movie has a good cast of many familiar faces appearing in different parts of the film. Tom Cruise in the main role gives it his best as he usually does. It would have been cooler if Willem Dafoe stayed for longer in the movie than he did but maybe then he would have chewed the scenery too much and outweigh the film.Generally, the movie seems to get better as it progresses because the good structure starts becoming more and more apparent and the ideas start paying off, but I wish it was not so pushy.

I've made it a priority to thank veterans for their service when I see them in uniform out in public, but I've made it a special one to recognize the Vietnam vets. Regardless of my feelings on the war, I can't shortchange the bravery and the blatant disrespect the men in battle experienced when returning to their homelands. They were the enemy down there and they were the enemy back home. For a lack of a better term they were homeless.Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July is a film that details their struggle better than any film I have yet to see. I can't speak from experience - and for that I'm thankful - but after reading autobiographies and recounts from the war, this seems like the film that got it right in terms of having you see the emotion and the energy bursting from the seems of the celluloid.It stars Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic, a selfless man from New York, who decides join the Marines and fight for his country in the Vietnam War. Love it or leave it, he tells war protesters. He is the archetypal nationalist, against any and all forms of outspoken dissent about the country and its legislation or system. When he is drafted into Vietnam, he embraces the thrill and excitement of the war and the violence, until he becomes disoriented one day and accidentally shoots a new platoon member. This scars Kovic mentally, until he is badly wounded in battle, paralyzing him from the waist down; that scars him physically.He returns home paralyzed and in the confines of a wheelchair, still disillusioned about the Vietnam War. The film than calmly follows his descent into madness, growing shaggier in look and mood day-by-day. He lumbers around aimlessly, frequenting strip clubs and brothels, becoming more aggressive with family and friends, and deeply resenting methods of protest. That is, until his brother, who has become staunchly anti-war in his absence, tells him to look at what the war did to him. Kovic has now become paralyzed, irreversibly scarred mentally and physically, and later loosens grip on his heavily patriotic stance towards America.The saddening part is this is not just a true story (the film was based off the book Born on the Fourth of July by Ron Kovic) but likely a true story for many other veterans whose act of courage turned into a scarring, horrifying albatross on their life. Stone co-wrote the film with Kovic, leaving the impression that much, if not all, of what is in the film is true to the story of Kovic himself. This leads to just more sorrow on the viewer's part.What I find surprising is how well Kovic's descent is portrayed onto film; with more inclusions of quiet ballads and long-shots of scenery this could pass for a seriously great independent film. However, with Stone behind the camera, the story is given a more grandiose feel, which is perfectly fine with me. Stone has been known to man the camera on political epics that many find themselves loving or despising. Perhaps this is because Stone's films clearly communicate some sort of bias, politically and emotionally. They want you to feel everything as it is meant to be felt and they want you to embrace the political ideology of the time.This fact shouldn't be a big issue because, I believe, even the most heartened Vietnam War supporter can agree that Kovic's case is an extremely depressing one. Born on the Fourth of July details the loss of faith, hope, and trust in his government, and the final sequences featuring Kovic protesting the war are truly remarkable in their portrayal. Saying Kovic woke up to the reality of an issue is a bit mean and condescending. In retrospect, his idea of blindly reading the headlines disintegrated when he finally go out in the battlefield and saw the hellishness that was war.One of the strongest things the film does is detail social change as well. Prior to the Vietnam War, it was the ultimate social-sin to criticize the country in any way, regardless of how wrong you thought we were. Even now, you can see the fire in someone's eyes if they are an enormous patriot and America is criticized politically or socially. One thing the Vietnam War did was stretch the boundaries of democracy; why were the war-protesters such bad people in the first place? Because they had a differing opinion than the norm? If anything, they were testing how far the ideas of democracy could stretch. Not all of their acts were justified, but it's safe to say that their impact and subversive qualities should not be diminished entirely just because they held an opinion contrary to your own.Stone's Born on the Fourth of July is something of a wake-up call. Even though the war is long over, thousands still suffer and thousands haven't began to receive the recognition they deserve. The film is uncompromising in its portrayal of borderline lunacy and the fighting and arguing about differing outlooks and views is nothing short of compelling and honest. It's a biopic, in some regard, that no one wants to claim, but it belongs to one man and countless others.Starring Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J. Barry, Jerry Levine, Frank Whaley, and Willem Dafoe. Directed by Oliver Stone.

From the opening scene we see the life through the eyes of real life vet, Ron Kovic, as a kid running around with a toy machine gun. As he grows up into his teens where the start of the Vietnam war is upon him, he enlists, despite the disapproval of his friends, one in particular, warning him, You could get killed Ronnie, you ever think about that. A part of him does die over there, as also shown in Stone's Platoon, that being innocence. Before setting off, one thing he has to do, is kiss the neighborhood girl of his dreams, where he cuts in on a dance, as she had already been asked by someone else to the social. Missed your chance Tom. Cruise delivers a top floor performance playing on every emotion, of this true character, it's hard to look away from such excellent acting of his here. He just compels you. In particular, was the scene where after returning back, now a paraplegic, he broke down in front of the family, after cursing, and exposing a little of himself. We can really see Vietnam changed him. Another scene right up towards the end, notably, that took such brazen courage, was where he confronted the parents of another vet, he mistakenly killed. It's a thing that had to be done, as it must of been eating Kovic inside, though if was an additional part of the story, I don't know, and I would certainly apologize if it wasn't. We get the sense here and there, that this in an anti Vietnam movie, but it wasn't a nice war. This movie is top floor all he way, a beautifully shot period piece, with a top rate script and acting, with a few stars who return from Platoon in minor parts. I loved it, not only when Cruise nearly got clobbered in that bar, but later when he went down to Guatemala to hang out with other paraplegic vets, soaking up the sun, alcohol and whores, where Dafoe spouted a few funny but true lines, regarding those girls of ill repute, and endless card playing. The movie's flow is great, where we spend a significant, or more so perfect amount of time with Kovic before Vietnam, and enough time on the battlefield to understand the ugliness of this war, through all the red dust, explosions, and some heavy, sufficient dozes of violence. And then we have the aftermath, where Kovic's left to pick up the pieces. Like Platoon (where this film is rumored to have been better) again this will touch tender spots with Vets, but this is a great put together film, that Stone should certainly be proud of. It's a film that deserves to be seen, even if not seeing or being a fan of Platoon. Some people I know, reckon the film's crap, I almost want to clobber them. The demonstration after that guilty admittance by Cruise, where he made that speech was fantastic as well as that repeated verbalism One, two, three, four, we don't want your stinking war, I'd prefer fu..ing war, but stinking sums it up, exactly.

This film, which was released in 1989, was adapted from the best selling autobiography of the same name, written by Ron Kovic, an actual Vietnam War veteran. This film follows the life story of Ron Kovic as he serves the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and after he returns to the United States as a deeply troubled individual, haunted by his past and his disabilities. This film explores a lot of fundamental issues that Vietnam War veterans faced while trying to reintegrate into society and continue on with their lives. The film, Born on the Fourth of July begins with Ron Kovic as a small child attending a Fourth of July parade where war veterans are seen marching on. This is the first scene that highlights some of the hardship and trauma veterans face after the war, where a soldier is seen flinching because of the sound of a firecracker popping, indicating of what seems to be post-traumatic stress disorder. As the film continues, Kovic, played by Tom Cruise, is seen enlisting in the United States Marine Corps after initially hearing a speech from an active duty marine, before the film suddenly jumps to his time in Vietnam. During his service in Vietnam, as he begins his second tour, Kovic's battalion is tricked into firing upon a nearby village by men of the Viet Cong, causing them to kill innocent villagers. Subsequently scarring Kovic, especially because of the death of a small baby boy at his hands. From there, the story progresses to a point where Kovic accidentally kills a fellow marine while in a dazed state, before he is finally shot as well. The subsequent part of the movie is Kovic after being sent back to the United States due to an injury that has caused him to be paralyzed waist down. The film continues with Kovic and his struggle being bound to a wheelchair, while the Veterans Affairs provides minimum support and inadequate services. With all his relationships with other people damaged, Kovic's life is left in shambles, causing him to eventually go to a haven for Vietnam War veterans in Mexico. With his move to Mexico only further causing him to feel more alone, isolated, and broken, Kovic decides to work towards reassembling his life by first reconciling with the family of the soldier he accidentally killed and by also joining the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. A group of veterans who push to fight against further involvement in Vietnam. This adaption of Ron Kovic's autobiography was a very well made film appealing to the audience's sympathy and heart by introducing and exploring what it is like for many veterans out there who have been wounded, who have killed, or have seen friends that have been injured or who have died. This film effectively depicts many of the larger issues that Vietnam War veterans have faced. For example, throughout the movie, besides being paralyzed, Kovic is constantly seen flinching when there are loud sounds around. A sign of PTSD (post- traumatic stress disorder), a common disorder that many war veterans acquire after going through traumatic experiences in warfare. Furthermore, Born on the Fourth of July successfully conveys and shows the feelings, thoughts, and actions of a deeply disturbed veteran, through Kovic's character. Similar to many soldiers who serve in war, Kovic is haunted by his actions and by the things he witnessed. For example, immediately after killing a fellow marine in Vietnam and watching that baby boy die, Kovic is mentally scarred to the point where he constantly has flashbacks, doubts, and anxiety attacks. Going through something as traumatic as that, Kovic is unable to speak of his experiences, seen in one of the scenes where he refuses to tell a fellow war veteran what he had done in Vietnam. Born on the Fourth of July also effectively displays the ideologies and ignorance of many Americans during the beginning of the Vietnam War, as well as the conditions that Vietnam War veterans had to come back to. During the beginning of the film, as expected, the majority of the people, including Kovic held the belief that the United States was in Vietnam for a good reason, which was to fight against the spread of communism. However, only after seeing the number of casualties the war was bringing with no sign of a close end, did people finally begin to see how unnecessary and brutal the war was. As seen in the last scenes of the film, crowds of people, which included Vietnam War veterans, began to protest against the war because it was clear that the war was unnecessarily putting American lives in danger. Besides this, this film also shows the conditions to which veterans had to come back to. As seen in the film, the VA and its facilities were deplorable due to lack of funding and support. In the film, it is made apparent of the lack of doctors and qualified staff that is present to help the veterans recuperate and recover. This film does well to accurately convey the different mindsets of Americans during the Vietnam War, as well as the largely unfavorable circumstances that veterans came back to.In conclusion, Born on the Fourth of July is a very entertaining and informative film that helps shed light on the times surrounding the Vietnam War, where tension in society rose and the United States involvement in Vietnam only increased. Focused on the life story of Ron Kovic and his experiences as a Vietnam War veteran, this film has successfully presented the issues and circumstances that America was in, as well as the hardship that awaited the Vietnam War veterans.

Ronnie looks quite dull but he's got a beautiful girlfriend named Donna who offers him an original NY cap. It's Ronnie's birthday, his mother tells him with pride-irradiating eyes You're my little Yankee Doodle boy. During a night illuminated by the fireworks, Ron and Donna kiss, a privilege that small boys rarely get at 10, but it's Ronnie, Ronnie who makes his baseball team win and victoriously lifts his pumps in the air, so perfect it's unreal.There is yet a reason why the opening of Born on the Fourth of July possesses this disorienting dream-like aspect, for it's too over-the-top from a director like Oliver Stone not to be deliberate. It starts like a fantasy because it's exactly into this that American values were turned after World War II, the idea that whatever America does is right, and any American boy should be proud to defend his country, to win, to be the best. It echoes General Patton's words the very idea of losing is detestable for America. Yet Patton fought in a war that, no matter how devastating it was, was necessary. The Vietnam War was not and now, it's a wound forever carved in America's heart, a stain in its soul, for which Oliver Stone's film works on a cathartic level.Fittingly Born on the 4th of July, Ron Kovic incarnates the spiritual destruction the Vietnam War applied on America's youth, before it turned into a generation-defining realization. That realization is the emotional core of the film and it's powerfully carried by Tom Cruise's performance. Cruise's good looks always played a significant part in his films because they helped to build a misleading feeling just to be contradicted by the evolution of his character (Rain Man, Jerry Maguire&#x85;). Born on the Fourth of July also features an extraordinary evolution, but in terms of acting, it transcends every other performance from Cruise. As Kovic, he personifies the patriotic enthusiasm of a youth that grew in a star-and-stripe clad cradle and its transformation into anger against the system that fooled them.And the higher Kovic went in the expression of his patriotism, the harder he fell. What is fascinating in Kovic is that he isn't necessarily perfect before the War; he loses at a wrestling game and sobs like a baby under the booing of a heartless crowd. Kovic is so 'Americanised' that losing a game is as upsetting as losing a war. So when the first recruitment's program for the Marine Corps comes to his school, he takes it as a chance to prove his value. Kovic loves his country and will serve it, even if he has to die. The 'trick' is that he didn't explore the eventuality of ending crippled and that's crucial when a man lives, he's proud of having done his job, when he dies, he's not here to express any regrets, but on a wheelchair, it's another side of the show he's going to discover.The film's scope is so big that Stone rightfully keeps the essential from each episode of Kovic's life, especially since Platoon was eloquent enough about the war. The fight scenes show that GI killed baby and civilians&#x85; accidentally but so was it when they killed each other in battles far from the usual epic exaltations. Then, Kovic is shot and spends a long time in the veteran's hospital one of the film's highlight, an invitation to discover the treatment, crippled soldiers received the last rites (just in case), bathing in their own filth, incapable to clean themselves, sharing the place with rats. Kovic is told that he can't walk anymore, can't even have children; he endures a rough treatment to prevent amputation. But what he can't stand, more than pain, stink, rats or his disability&#x85; is one carer's anti-war comment. His condition didn't earn him any respect or compassion, and the worst is yet to come.Returning at home, Kovic realizes that life has changed, hippies give him the finger; the American flag is burned instead of being proudly raised in the air. Love it or leave it! still shouts Kovic in denial. The attitude spread to his Family, his own brother doesn't believe in the war, and the trip to self-awareness doesn't end here. Wherever he goes, Kovic is confronted to disrespect and carelessness, a friend who didn't believe in the War, is doing well in fast-food business, a WWII veteran reminds him he's got no reason to be angry about, he fought, he lost, and gives him the ultimate insult by calling him a traitor. The anger's burning in Kovic's heart reaches its heart-breaking pinnacle when he wakes up his whole family, submerged by his drunkenness, he -for the first time- understands that this war destroyed him, for nothing, because the very America he fought for, is now acting like an ungrateful bitch.But the courage of Kovic is not to stand alone in his own blindness. During a trip in a Mexican whorehouse where he encounters veterans living in the same condition, he's left alone with a vet played by Willem Dafoe in the desert, they fight, insult, spit on each other, but it's probably the last step before self-awareness. Symbolizing through his character's arc a real revolution in America's society, Kovic becomes the spokesperson of a whole generation against the war. Not because one shouldn't fight for his country, but because there were no values noble enough to fight in Vietnam, to destroy America's spirit, no matter how supposedly 'evil' Communism was, America was no better in that war. Kovic said that who fought there, and Oliver Stone showed that, who fought there, too. Intelligent, thought provoking and uncompromising, Born of the Fourth of July is one of the most important American films, and one of the best of the 80's.

He is a master at selecting the moments in a the story of a life that have the greatest impact. It took great artistic humility for him to make a movie that displays the war from the perspective of those who supported it without condescension.Outside of Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise might be the actor of this generation. It's a shame he's fallen off the map, but when a good director takes a chance on him (Stone, Anderson, Kubrick), he's never let down. He can drain every ounce of emotion out of a dramatic situation.Yes, the movie has its flaws. They are little things, primarily in the war scenes. Yet Stone has the strategic sense to pick the three things most powerful about going to war (1 Killing innocents 2 Killing with friendly fire 3 Getting shot) to get the point across. The movie is really about what happens after the war, where Cruise and Stone both really shine. Ronnie goes from the stereotypical All-American boy, optimistic and admirable to the viewer, to desperately singing protest songs in the bar. The movie doesn't take too strong of a political stance (though it does disparage Nixon). One of the underlying themes is the disconnect between the government and the American people in information, and how this gap is used to take advantage of the people. MEDIUM SPOILER The communist hating Ronnie is nearly blacklisted by the end of the movie. It's about how two groups of people can be right depending on what perspective they are privy to; the protesters are seen as ignorant at points, until the end of the film. Semper fi, Oliver Stone.

I am your Yankee Doodle Dandy, your John Wayne come home, your Fourth of July firecracker exploding in the grave. Oliver Stone won his second Oscar for Best Direction with Born on the Fourth of July and it also had to do with the Vietnam War just like his previous film Platoon. Stone was a Vietnam War veteran himself and by now we all know his political and ideological views which can be seen in most of his films. This movie focuses more on how the war impacted one individual and how his values changed over the course of time. It is based on the autobiographical book written by Ron Kovic who also worked with Oliver Stone on writing the screenplay. Kovic is known for being an anti-war spokesperson, but the film begins by exploring his early life and how he dreamt about being a war hero and a patriot. His values didn't change even soon after he returned home and at first was hurt by all the protesters, but over time he changes and that is what the film explores more than the actual war itself. The movie studies the psychological impact the war had on this man who dreamt of becoming a war hero from his childhood only to be disillusioned by it after being severely wounded and left paralyzed from the chest down. Ron blindly wants to serve his country and states that he will gladly die in the war, but those of us who are familiar with his story know that his views will change over time and that is the major attraction this movie has. We want to discover how Ron made such an important transition in his life because we all know values are something men don't easily change. The transformation that Kovic experiences from an innocent young kid to an anti-war spokesperson is the major attraction of the movie and Tom Cruise carries the movie with his very believable performance.The movie opens with little Ronnie (Brian Larkin) playing outdoors with his friends from the neighborhood. He lives with his family in Massapequa, Long Island and grows up in a very patriotic and catholic household. He is raised by his father (Raymond J. Barry), a War Veteran himself, and mother (Caroline Kava), a devout catholic who teaches his son about fearing God and loving the country. Ronnie was born on the fourth of July so he remembers spending his birthdays watching the parade and receiving the War veterans as heroes. His childhood sweetheart is Donna(Jessica Prunell) who is always cheering for him at the local baseball games at which he excels. He was impacted by Kennedy's inaugural speech and the film then jumps to his Senior year in High School where he was a wrestler. Ron (now played by Tom Cruise) continues to be shy and innocent and Donna (Kyra Sedqwick) is still in love with him. One day a recruiting marine officer (Tom Berenger) visits the High School and Ron is inspired by him to join the marines along with his friend Timmy (Frank Whaley), although his other buddy Steve (Jerry Levine) tries to convince them otherwise so that he study in college like him. Ron decides to go to war and there are a few strong battle scenes which impacted his life, first when he accidentally kills women and children in the line of fire and then an American soldier, and later when he is severely wounded and becomes paralyzed from the chest down. The rest of the film explores the poor treatment he received at the hospital, his return home and how he became the man who he now is.The film shouldn't be seen as simply a war movie, it is an autobiography on Ron Kovic's inspirational life and Tom Cruise plays his so well that the film succeeds. This is one of his best performances ever as we experience through him the transformation that Ron experiences. The scene where he runs in the rain to get to the prom and dance with Donna before leaving for the War reminds us of what his life could have been like if he stayed home. It was a very powerful and touching scene. There are also other great dramatic scenes like the breakdown he experiences at home with his mother and the conversation he has with Timmy once they both return from War. Willem Defoe has some interesting scenes as well as the friend Ron meets when he travels to Mexico. This is where Ron discovers he is just one of the many victims the insignificant war has left. I really enjoyed the story and even though it was probably a very personal movie for Oliver Stone and very biased, the story still worked because Ron Kovic himself worked with Stone on the screenplay. The movie was nominated for best screenplay although it didn't win. The only other award it received, beside the best director, was for best editing although it was nominated in eight categories. I really enjoyed the score and cinematography that helped set the overall mood and effectiveness of the movie. I highly recommend this film, whatever your feelings are towards Stone.

The thrill is in Stone's pacing of the film, the rapidness and short lived childhood in New York before the branching out into a tour of Vietnam during the war and finally slowing the entire piece down as the injuries sustained on that tour take their physical and mental toll on our lead; a toll born out of a certain president's foreign policies and their encouragement of the youth of the day to engage in activities that'll, supposedly, make a difference. I suppose the film is a part of Stone's 'rage' cannon of the late 1980s, early 1990s which saw a flurry of films released little more than twelve months or so apart from one another that attacked all manner of things America stood for; the centre piece here resembling something like John F. Kennedy's speech of it not being a case of what your country can do for you, but something resembling vice-versa and the ill affects if that.Kovic was drawn into the world of the U.S. Marines by way of Kennedy's speech as well as a band of recruitment officers whom visited his school campus. Fittingly, by the time another former U.S. president has arrived onto our screens, it is in the form of Nixon and by this time, we feel Kovic has found his voice in amongst all the hardships after having Kennedy essentially lead him in. Kovic's childhood is constructed as this eerily picturesque existence which comes chock full of utopian iconography representing; the winning shot in a baseball match as parents watch on is balanced with a very American celebration of Americanism and patriotism in the form of Independence day marching complete with bands and the honouring of war heroes of past. His gaze is captured as he sits atop his father's shoulders looking on at these Second World War veterans, a degree of morbid fascination perhaps filling his mind as he watches the adulation these people receive but perhaps failing to spot both the results of war some of them sport. Additionally, a war game in the opening scene descends into chaos amongst kids creating a sensation that it certainly felt like a good idea at the time, but bickering and bad form take over. As Kovic's childhood moves into adolescence, the man develops into this odd conventional figure of blind patriotism combined with Christian values and the sort whom rushes to one's school ending prom, in the rain, just in time to have this perversely romanticised dance with a childhood sweetheart.Tom Cruise plays the role of Kovic from around this age and upward, his rough and ready look years on from his teenage years consisting of enlisting and so forth displaying a real sense of maturity in the man's acting at such an early age way back when. The innocence, or stupidity, of youth is captured when Kovic and his pals discuss military enrolment and confuse the action with links to masculinity, labelling being able to fight with other men and hold rifles as 'manly' things as the one voice whom rejects such a proposal belonging to Steve (Levine) talks of his wishes to stay behind and engage in activity of a more culinary nature, specifically the running of a diner; actions perhaps more associated with the female of the species, if looking through the narrow slats possessed by the majority of these boys. Stone shoots most of these early exchanges colourfully and lovingly, sprinkling Kovic's life with the odd come-down in the form of a defeat to a rival school in a mat wrestling match after so much training and graft; foreshadowing the let down or frustration born out of believing in something so much to a point, with his post-Vietnam life resembling a greater extension of these thoughts and feelings.Our first look in at a kind of post Vietnam existence is a grimy and colourless Bronx set hospital for the veterans, a systematic look at how veterans of said war are both treated and how many of them struggle from the off in their dealing with this new found scenario. Twinned with this is the guilt Kovic himself carries with him following an accidental shooting of a friendly marine out in Vietnam in the aftermath of a firefight. Where Kovic finds solace in this new existence, after the establishing of how he must now lead his life following paralysis from the waist down, is political rallying and making things known to those ill-informed on events in the war. This is a result of a domestic disagreement with a family member as well as with Steve, who has since gone on to carve a decent enough life out of staying behind, like he said he would, to work at a diner. Stone directs the piece masterfully, changing gears in tempo and pace to suit the ease and toughness in which life travels by; shooting parts of Mexico the Vietnam veterans descend to in order to drown out life's newfound problems with this very warm, very welcoming feel; of which the segment begins with a deliberately appealing establishing shot of a good looking beach before we head on in and get more involved with what sordid activity is going on. A veteran of said war himself, and here emotionally bringing to life the experiences of another, Born on the Fourth of July is a weighty and involving film of impressive magnitude from Stone.

They had done Vietnam movies to death at this point (DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, BOYS OF COMPANY C, HAMBURGER HILL). All those prior films, except for COMING HOME and DEER HUNTER in parts are about the actual Vietnam experience, whereas BORN is virtually about the effects on the soldier upon returning home. You'd think that by the time of BORN (1989), a film about anything related to Vietnam would seem like retread. Thankfully, due to Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise, it is anything but that. An amazingly involving film that stands out amongst the great Vietnam films, BORN quite possibly cracks the top 5 Vietnam movies! It catches your attention from the opening when our hero Ron Kovic (portrayed brilliantly by Mr. Cruise) briefly narrates how he came to be infatuated with war and his country as a boy. Such an innocent scene of little Ronny playing war with his friends on his birthday, the 4th of July. Then sitting on his father's back during the 4th of July parade and admiring the veteran soldiers passing by. Soon after we see a teenage Ron working in the grocery store afterschool with all the enthusiasm and energy a young teen should have. Amazing that at this point in his career (I think Cruise was actually in his late 20s) that he could so perfectly make us believe him as a teen! Then Ron enlists in the Marines and goes off to Vietnam to be badly wounded (permanent paralysis). The brief Vietnam scenes are incredibly authentic and the VA hospital scenes are some of the most disgusting and gruesome ever filmed. Ron and other vets are treated like utter crap by the VA employees and he has to endure this treatment while being devastated that he has lost permanent use of his legs. Ron returns home and THIS scene that occurs around the midway point of the film is the one that I most remember. Watching this once energetic, full-of-life young man now permanently disabled and having to return to his family in this condition chokes me up to this day, especially that brief moment with his mother. As time passes, Ron realizes that his idealism may have been misplaced and that war, in particular this war, may not have been the right one to fight. His own family turns against him, the very ones who encouraged him in the first place...Sad...So Ron leaves and moves to Mexico to get away from his troubles and hooks up with similar vets who live a life of booze and sexual pleasure (as best these men could experience). He soon realizes that these people are no more his friends than perfect strangers and that he must battle and defeat his inner demons to become a complete man again.I'm not a big fan of biopics, but Stone's film seems to capture the essence of the pre, during, and post Vietnam experience from one brave, great man's viewpoint, but never devolves into pontification or tedium. And frankly, generally films like this can easily become tedious. The cinematography, sound, and editing is brilliant. Mostly, the film benefits from Mr. Cruise, a truly GREAT actor who proved that he could play with the big boys! Really, one of the best portrayals of a real-life person in film ever!

Sadly, it's also the type of war movie that is instantly forgettable... there wasn't a single image, scene, or revelation substantial enough to leave an indelible mark on me. That said, the film is competent in every way, but pales in comparison to Oliver Stone's own Vietnam movie Platoon. Made back when Tom Cruise was taking roles that seemed to parallel his own struggles in life (masculinity, religion, adulthood), the movie tells the true story of paralyzed Vietnam vet Ron Kovic who makes the journey from gung-ho, flag-waving Marine to embittered, paralyzed anti-war spokesman. It's a metaphor perhaps for America's own transition from self-righteous world guardian to humbled victim, yet the changes in Kovic never seem to go deeper than the surface; the movie's like a slightly darker version of Forrest Gump. Okay, I'm being too harsh again- nothing's as bad as Forrest Gump- but a movie that tackles this subject matter is almost obligated to take you to the darkest extremes of the nightmares of war and it's aftermaths... I never worried about the Ron Kovic character- not as a teen, not in 'nam, and certainly not after his return the States as the poster boy for the folly of combat. I never sensed real danger, possibly because he never got a chance to breathe.Maybe the blame here has to go to script there are so many plot points to hit along a carefully-crafted storyline that you never get to indulge in a human moment in which the actors transcend the words on paper. Ron can't have a real scene with the great Willem Dafoe because he has to rush to a hooker, and before we can appreciate her night of sexual healing Ron has to be humiliated for wanting to see her again, and then he's off to the desert for a wheelchair battle with his mirror image. It's like a road trip where you drive so fast you never get to SEE anything.If the movie makes even one person question the wisdom of war and the lives it consumes then I'll have to consider it a success, but if you haven't seen Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, or Platoon, you need to go do that.Right now.GRADE C "},{"Title":"Perfect script, perfect acting","Date":"16 July 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":" Why don't they write films like this anymore.

Coppola created the breathtaking Apocalypse Now, and Michael Cimino created my favourite The Deer Hunter. And yet those movies, I think, set out to tell an abstract, universal story about war that could fit any war &#150; WWII, Vietnam, The Gulf, etc war is hell. But Stone's earlier Platoon was perhaps the first great movie that explored the relationships between American soldiers in Vietnamese soil born out of the circumstances they found themselves in. I don't believe Platoon could have been told with WWI as the backdrop &#150; especially because the movie is based on Stone's personal experience in 'Nam.And Born On The Fourth Of July yet again explores an intrinsic aspect of the Vietnam War the veterans' homecoming. Stone takes his time setting up the story at the beginning he shows the viewer a WWII veterans' parade in young Ron Kovic's town being received with warmth, respect and admiration. A clear contrast is made later in the movie in Kovic's parade wherein anti-war protesters try to disrupt the parade. Stone thus visually shows peoples' attitude towards the two wars the former was accepted and supported with patriotic zeal; the former divided a baffled America which didn't accept its government's lies nor couldn't understand the point of the war.The beginning of the movie is pure foreshadowing in itself, as young Ronnie and his friend play soldiers in the woods and is ambushed and 'killed' by his friends. Stone sets this scene to immediately show the sort of patriotic, army-worshiping, 'tough' kid Ronnie is, and to foreshadow his tragic incident in Vietnam. Even as a kid we can see Ron Kovic is a complicated person loved by his parents but having a domineering mother watching over him, filling his head with patriotic nonsense against the 'communist evil,' he becomes a rather dysfunctional kid look at his behaviour when Donna kisses him; he gets on the ground and starts doing push-ups&#133; what? Is that supposed to impress her or he can't just interact well with women? Considering the Bible-strict family he comes from, it's no wonder. There are even hints that Ron's mother is somewhat ashamed of him her expression when he loses the wrestling match seems to imply she finds him a loser, and her artificial goodness when Ron returns from the Vet's hospital in a wheelchair says the same. It's like she's embarrassed.Although the movie is consistently good &#151; except for the Mexico segment, in my opinion &#151; it becomes really great after Ron returns from 'Nam. The Veteran hospital segment is just brilliant we're shown how the veteran soldiers were dependent on uncaring, disrespectful warders who couldn't care less about the 'Nam; we see the awful conditions these soldiers were treated, with lack of money, resources, material; we see the soldiers being treated inhumanly and just craving some respect and dignity&#133; or at least that's their viewpoint. The truth is, most of them think they deserve the moon and the stars just because they went to some foreign country kill babies in the name of freedom&#133; but the warders can see just past through that nonsense and treat them like the ordinary people the veterans think they're not. I particularly love the scene where one warder tells Kovic that the Vietnam war is a rich man's war, and the true war is being fought in the USA, at the University campuses, for civil rights and equality. That's how disconnected from the real world Kovic is, that he sees the war his government dumped on him through his blind patriotism, but neglect what's really going on. And his staying in the hospital is a real eye-opener.Truth be said, Ron Kovic never changes &#151; although there's a superficial transition in the movie from Vietnam War apologist to anti-war protester, the fact is Kovic is characterised from the first scene as a man who only wants to do what's best for the country he so much loves; and at one point that means defending the Vietnam War with weak arguments &#151; how can you defend sending young men to die miles way from home, anyway? &#151; but as Kovic slowly matures he realises protesting against the war is really defending his country, even if it means being called traitor, beaten or arrested. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Kovic invades a Nixon convention and speaks to a journalist how the American government has lied to its people and convinced an entire generation of young men to die for nothing, and then dozens of people try to reach him to beat him up, spit in on or just insult him. It's a poignant scene because of Kovic's raw words and John Williams' always emotional score. The uplifting ending is just the cherry on the top for what is an otherwise amazing movie about human nature triumphing in the worst of conditions.

Indeed, he was right. 'Born On the Fourth Of July,' based on the book by Ron Kovic, follows Kovic's account of his experiences in Vietnam and the indifferent nation that he returned to. Although released in 1989, it holds up to the current situation that exists in Iraq now-many refer to it as the new Vietnam. Regardless of anyone's opinion on the current Iraq war, 'Born On the Fourth of July' is one of the most affecting, and important war related films of all time. As the film opens, we find a young Kovic pretending to be a soldier with friends-a time when the idea of being a soldier was heroic since their father's had been heroes in WWII. The film then follows Kovic as a popular athlete in high school up to his recruitment as a Marine. Kovic rationalizes his reasons for joining up as Communists have missiles pointed at us now and we have to save our country from its threats. During his time in Vietnam, Kovic sees the true nature of war. His platoon mistakenly fires upon a town where the enemy is supposedly hiding; however, they end up killing women and children. During the confusion that follows, Kovic accidentally shoots a fellow soldier-his guilt would encompass him for years to come. But when Kovic himself is wounded in a field, he is sent home paralyzed from the waist down. He spends the first few months in a veteran hospital, which in this case, was a slum. The doctors inform him that he will never be able to use his legs again, and that he no longer has the ability to have children. When he returns to his home, he realizes that the world has changed. People protest the war, sometimes protesting against the soldiers themselves. His own family is indifferent to the war, as are his old friends. In one scene, he is told by an old friend who has become successful as a fast food manager, 'people here-they don't give a s**t about the war! To them it's just a million miles away.'Eventually becoming disillusioned by everything in his hometown, Kovic spends a great deal of time with other veterans like himself at a resort in Mexico. Later he becomes an activist-his first public activism took place at the 1972 Republican National Convention where he was televised for exposing the reality of what soldiers endured in Vietnam, but also on the reasons why we did not belong there in the first place. 'Born On the Fourth of July' spends a good deal of time focusing on the misplaced patriotism that the politicians spewed at the public to drum up support not only for Vietnam, but the Cold War, in general. The film shows this by Kovic's own mother constantly reminding her son that he was doing the right thing by going over there and fighting and that he was in God's hands. When Kovic returns home and his disillusionment grows, he gets drunk one night and yells at his mother, 'There is no God. There is only me in this chair for the rest of my life!'The film does stand up today just as strong as ever. With soldiers returning home from Iraq, and the constant media attention of terrorist attacks over there and seeing our own soldiers ambushed all the time, those who fight now must feel the same anger and frustration that Kovic felt year ago. It does make one wonder, when will the politicians ever truly get it! **** "},{"Title":"Powerful, but simple","Date":"3 August 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":"  It may be hard to remember in the age where his service in the Vietnam war is a major political asset for John Kerry, but that war was for many years a real embarrassment to America (which fought and lost it).  The veterans of that war were among those to pay the price as mainstream society preferred to forget what it had done in sending them there. The movie industry, meanwhile, eventually established its own orthodoxy we could hardly expect Hollywood to praise those who refused the draft (or indeed the Viet Cong); but now there are many movies which, without defending the war or the way it was fought, nonetheless celebrate the individual soldiers who took part.  This narrative extends to also telling the tale of their subsequent betrayal at home, which is the subject of 'Born on the 4th of July', as well as earlier films like the masterful 'Deer Hunter' and, obliquely, 'Taxi Driver'.Before this film, Oliver Stone had a reputation for making one-dimensional, bombastic movies, and Tom Cruise had one as a pretty boy who couldn't act.  But Cruise certainly widens his range, playing a crippled veteran with some passion and skill, and although Stone has not made a subtle film here, it's at least an improvement on the atonal 'Platoon'.  The basic story is naturally compelling, although the beginning is over-stylised (or, to be more cutting, under-individualised) and the happy ending (Cruise's character becomes a Democratic activist) is a bit strange, given Johnson's instrumental role in Vietnam.  Ultimately, the film's critique of the war is put forward with some partisanship, but also too simply to convince it's purpose is more to explain how the hero changed his mind than to make us change ours.  Overall, it's not a bad film; but I'm still waiting to see a Vietnam movie that really dares make the toughest political points.  It does, however, provide an early hint of Stone's obsession with Richard Nixon, which came out more fully in his later work.

Make no mistake, the man can write with persuasion and he can illustrate a story eloquently through camerawork and editing like few others can.Born on the Fourth of July is both good and evil.  The first half, involving Tom Cruise as young Ron Kovic going off to war, are both fascinating in capturing his naivety and youthful angst.  Unfortunately, the second half scrapes along the ground until it finally grinds to a halt.Tom Cruise demonstrates that, between this movie and Rain Man, that he can perform in roles beyond Ethan Hunt and Maverick (roles I am happy to admit that I am entirely sick of).  While I am happy he made this movie, I do not like the overlong runtime.  This movie should not have received it's Oscar for Best Editing and Stone didn't deserve Best Director.  John Williams' score is not as powerful as it could have been.  In many respects, it was only a primer to JFK, nothing more.

The film poses some great moral questions about whether or not Vietnam was a war worth fighting.  There are Vietnam vets who, 'til this day, brag about having fought in the war and feel they're 10 times more patriotic than any other American.  It's interesting to see Ron Kovic's slow and steady arc from being that type of vet, who curses anyone who defies the war, to an embittered, depressed individual who questions why he joined in the first place.  The film is main worth watching (though it certainly is not the only reason) for Tom Cruise's magnificent performance.  I've always been appreciative of Cruise's work, but along his work in A Few Good Men this is one of his best performances.  Though he's known as one of the most handsome actors in the industry, he's not afraid to make himself grotesque, inside and out.  His Oscar nomination was very well-deserved.  Willem Dafoe, another fine actor, gives a great supporting performance as a fellow paraplegic Vietnam vet who he meets on his trip to Mexico.  Raymond J. Barry is great as Ron's father.  Stone is a talented director, but his work can range from great to good to incredibly awful (i.e.  Natural Born Killers).  This is one of his very good films that he obviously put much passion into.  The film is long, but not overlong as it never drags and is constantly compelling, with sharp writing that almost takes you a journey with Kovic through his life.  The script itself is co-written by Kovic.  So for all of you film scholars with pads and papers, just waiting to scribble down some inaccuracies, the film is written by Kovic himself!  So save your barking.  The problem with biopics is that, throughout the course of the film, you can't help but keep in mind that it's based on a true story and stay alert for heavy-handed dramatizations.  For example, I'm pretty sure Kovic and Stone took some creative license with the scene where Kovic runs in the rain to his school prom to fetch his girl, pushing her current date away, and having a romantic dance together.  But there aren't too many of those noticeably stilted dramatizations.  Trust me, Born on the Fourth of July is definitely worth seeing!My score  8 (out of 10)      "},{"Title":"Fourteen Years Hence","Date":"11 June 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":"  There have been incredible innovations in cinema in the last fourteen years; this film is STILL an incredible achievement.

Kovic's rise to star-activist was portrayed, as most things in Hollywood, as split second activity that jumps from a heart wrenching scene between Kovic and the family of the soldier he accidentally shot (a scene that never really took place)to a Oscar award speech made on the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention. Activists aren't made like this, successful Activism is the product of years and years of backbreaking work and emotional setbacks. Not that I expect Stone to make a four hour film showing the actual creation of Kovic's life change, but it is important to realize what this says to young people who wish to dedicate their lives to creating social change. One may get to easily discouraged when they don't get national television coverage at their first protest. READ THE BOOK - it has a much better depiction, unbutchered by Stone, of the feeling of community opposition towards the war in Vietnam.

Second, I was born in 1983, so I never personally experienced any of the stuff this movie deals with.  Whose heart wouldn't break for Ron Kovic when he finds out that not only will he never walk again, he's also been castrated--by an enemy's bullet in a war he volunteered for.  When he is finally rehabilitated enough to go home, he receives something less than a hero's welcome, and he can't shake all the horrible things he did while fighting.  The government won't give much money to help the Vietnam veterans and Ron feels betrayed by his country, by his community, and by his family.  Born on the Fourth of July deals with all these elements masterfully.  However, the whole excursion to Mexico was just confusing and weird, and I think it could have been handled better.  Still, it picks up again by the end, and this film makes it easy to see why Oliver Stone is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  Stone pours his soul in every film he makes, especially the ones that involve the Vietnam War in some way.  He makes people think less of how right it is to become embroiled in a conflict, and more of the unending pain that involvement inevitably causes, the wounds that never heal, the losses never regained. Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veterans Day have become excuses for backyard barbecues, trips to the shore on the long weekend, and ten percent off all recliners at the furniture store.  This is a crying evil.  Films like Born on the Fourth of July serve to remind us of just how jaded Americans have become.  Oh look at us, we're so freaking great, everybody wave your miniature American flags at the crippled veterans living from tiny disability check to tiny disability check!  This may not be Oliver Stone's finest film (look to Platoon or JFK for that), but it is definitely an eye-opener for all the nutty jingoists and ignorant patriots out there.

His previous two Oscars had been for his screenplay for the powerful Midnight Express in 1978, and for Platoon in 1986. Stone was deserving of his Oscar for this film, which also seen Tom Cruise pick up a nomination for his amazing performance as Ron Kovic. I wouldn't usually be a fan of Tom Cruise. However, in saying that, I wouldn't hate the man like a lot of people seem to do. I generally would view him as a good actor at best, nothing brilliant. His powerful performance as Ron Kovic in this film is without a doubt the greatest performance of his career. He only lost out on the Oscar to a more worthy recipient - Daniel Day Lewis for his unbelievable performance as Christy Brown in My Left Foot.Oliver Stone had been trying for years to make this film, and at one point even, Al Pacino had been cast in the lead role as Kovic. However, production fell apart and finally, in the late eighties, Stone - with the success of Platoon behind him and two Oscars - got back to Kovic and they wrote the screenplay together. In the film, we see Kovic growing up in the typical, happy, patriotic American suburban home in the fifties with his strict Catholic morals and WW2 veteran father. A very fit and athletic young man, Kovic joins the Marine Corps after high school, determined to do a tour of duty in Vietnam - to do his bit for his country to stop communism spreading. He tells his parents that he will die over there if he has to. Two years later, and he's a sergeant on his second tour, and by now, he has seen horrible things and made some terrible mistakes that will haunt him for the rest of his life. In 1968, in a firefight, he is shot in the chest and the bullet severs his spine, making him paralysed from the mid-chest down. After a horrible stay in a veterans hospital in the Bronx resembling a hell on earth, he returns home to his family, and as the war keeps coming back haunting him, along with his frustrations caused by his disability and the hostility from the anti-war movement, Kovic becomes broken and disillusioned, and feels betrayed by the country he fought for and joins the anti-war movement...Watching this for maybe the fourth time last night, I couldn't help but feel how relevant and powerful this film is today - more than it ever was back in 1989. With the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there are many young men like Kovic returning home from war in wheelchairs, maimed etc. and who probably feel the same frustration and hopelessness that Kovic felt. So that's why I think this film is important for todays generation. It's inspirational, sad and very powerful. Tom Cruise is amazing in the lead role, and his transformation from a patriotic, gung-ho young man into a broken, scruffy shell of a man who feels like his country has betrayed him and who finds comfort in drink and prostitutes was very well tracked out, and this is all thanks to the wonderful editing that also earned the film an Oscar. John Williams provides a very rousing score, and Oliver Stone at the helm as usual does an amazing job. The Vietnam scenes were fantastic and they really stand out against other Vietnam films because they don't take place in the jungles, but instead on the beaches and later on, where Kovic gets wounded, in a barren, sun scorched field. The lighting was superb here, as we get the immense feel of a heavy setting sun as all these scenes are in orange and red effect, which cast some beautiful silhouettes. The sound is excellent, and the cinematography is just superb. The acting is brilliant all round, with supporting performances coming from Frank Whaley, Raymond J. Barry and Caroline Kava as well as a superb performance from Willem Dafoe in the last part of the film. Watch out for small appearances from Stephen Baldwin, Tom Sizemore and Tom Berenger. With his Vietnam trilogy, Stone covered all the main aspects of the war - the war for the average infantrymen with Platoon, the coming-home aspect of it with this film, and also, from the average Vietnamese peasant with Heaven and Earth. A great director who has since been the subject of a lot of criticism for his films of late which general opinion thinks he is beginning to lose his touch, but I still think he is a great director and is somewhat underrated. Born of the Fourth of July is a long enough film but it doesn't feel like it, thanks to the excellent editing and well-written screenplay. It's a masterpiece... really is; the true-story of a naive young man who went to war determined to fight for his country, and who came home broken mentally and physically before over-coming the world around him and becoming a loud and inspirational voice for the beaten and disenchanted of an entire nation.

It's as if there is something more stately about the narrative. Somehow though, the acting and set pieces do not cover the skeleton of this grand design.Cruise is very good as the paralysed/confused/bitter/states-man (in that order), working every scene that Stone sets up. Cruise has never had the ability to draw an audience right into a performance, his experience being depicted but never shared. However, the spectrum of pain - from being wounded, to dealing with the castration of paralysis both openly and in the privacy of an injudicious whore's bedroom - is skillfully portrayed. A well deserved Oscar nomination.An interesting film to revisit in 2004. One begins to realise the magnitude of the 9/11 attacks; along with JFK's assassination and Pearl Harbour, such significant but preposterously scarce events compared to the violence even in Europe cannot but galvanise the American people and their government into action which many people find disproportionate to the point of misguided.

This movie was about some trigger-happy war loving kid who wanted nothing more than to defend his country, without even looking into it he goes to 'see some action' and then, after he gets paralized and realizes that his life doesn't mean anything he starts to get mad.  But who does he get mad at?  Not himself.  He gets mad because people 'lied' to him... the answers were there if he would have looked for them.  Instead he's wheeling around for the whole movie feeling sorry for himself and expecting someone to give him a helping hand when it's his own fault.  No one MADE him go to war.  No one MADE him take that second bullet.  And instead of getting on with his life and accepting that HE made a mistake he expects people to feel sorry for himself.  His friend offers him a legit job and he pretty much spits it in his face.  And where does this climax that takes WAY too long end up? With him going out to make a speech that we never hear.  This movie is a far cry from being anything close to outstanding, and unless Stone was going for what I've said in this review than he failed miserably much like some of his other pictures.

I think what Stone tried to do with this movie was take a few of the same general ideas he used in Platoon and put them in some different circumstances.  Only he missed with this one.  There are some scenes that could have been cut out and it wouldn't have made any difference.  Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise) is determined to become a marine and go to Vietnam.  He even says that if he has to die there, well then so be it.  But then, we see what he has to live and see in Vietnam.  One afternoon, as the sun goes down, his platoon is attacked by the Vietnamese.  Kovic takes cover behind a sand dune when all of a sudden, somebody pops up on the dune.  Not hesitating for a second, Kovic fires his riffle.  However, after the gunfight ceases a few minutes later, Kovic realizes that the man he has killed was one of the men in his platoon.   Kovic can't get over this and the next day, he is shot.  When he wakes up, he finds himself in the hospital and later learns that he will never be able to walk again and that his hopes of being able to have children are nill.  But Ron is determined to walk again.  And so he tries and he tries until he falls down the bone of his leg pops out.  All his hopes suddenly just go to pieces.    So Ron returns to his hometown and after having had a fit with his younger brother who claims the stupidity of the war, Ron starts to realize that his brother is probably right and that the war was useless and stupid and so he takes part in all the anti-war movements.  But Ron changes a lot and finally he goes to Mexico where he finds ex-soldiers and prostitutes.  The rest that follows his trip to Mexico is the reconstitution of the life he lost at war.  The movie drags a lot at many times and there a few scenes that I would even consider boring and pointless.  Tom Cruise's performance is the best part of this movie and probably should have won an Oscar for it (although I haven't seen My left foot yet).  Stone tries to show once again the image of young men losing their innocence at war but did a much better job at it in Platoon.  So as you might have guessed, I didn't like the movie that much.  If you've got Platoon and Born on the 4th of July and you don't know which one to watch, you should definitely watch Platoon.

Oliver Stone has created a movie that will never be forgotten, and in my opinion, is one of his best.  My only complaints about this movie were the scenes in Mexico with Willem Dafoe and the Mexican prostitutes, those scenes were really not that necessary.

The propaganda here takes away from the storytelling &#150; it is as if Stone is using the story of Ron Kovic to simply bombard us with images and ideas and, let's be frank, occasional utter lies. Platoon this is not.The story opens in the 1950s, with a young Kovic, and sets up his rather clichéd existence naïve happy family, warm small-town community, and generally innocent surroundings. (It couldn't have all really been so peachy, could it?)As a teenager (now played by Tom Cruise) Kovic is enticed to join the Marines, and is enlisted in the Vietnam War, where he is permanently crippled (his legs become useless and &#150; for lack of a better description &#150; his most fragile area is shattered).Kovic is sent back home and, at first, pretends that everything is all right &#150; but it isn't. He's soon swearing at his parents, breaking down in tears, yelling about the horrific images he witnessed in Vietnam, cursing America &#150; all this leading to his own self-destruction.Kovic's story is a true one, but it is also greatly exaggerated by Stone with his use of factual inaccuracies and manipulation of truth. Cruise's performance is one of his finest (and he was nominated for Best Actor in 1989), but both he and Stone try too hard &#150; they take a good story and turn it into an overwhelming anti-war propaganda piece. The movie feels like it has no purpose &#150; as if Stone is using it as an excuse to bombard us with more of his theories about warfare and how wrong it is.War is wrong. But we can't ignore it. A movie such as Born on the Fourth of July takes a stab at a specific event in America's past, shaming the veterans (Kovic included) through its ignorant and naïve outlook. Stone spends so much time trying to convince us why Vietnam was a blunder, and why it was a disgrace, and why it was a horrible decision, and why Republicans are idiots (check out the grand finale outside the Republican National Convention), and why Kovic's fight for the truth is honorable, that he forgets to honor the vets themselves. He manipulates his audience to an extreme, using a bundle of tried-and-used film clichés to setup the Kovic character in the film. I have family members that were mentally scarred by Vietnam, but to pretend that anyone was 100% perfect before the war is silly &#150; and Stone's use of this technique is just his own way of forcing us to feel sympathy for a shallow version of Kovic.Vietnam was a mistake but let's not pretend that those who fought and gave their lives were pointless and useless. They deserve respect, even if the war itself doesn't &#150; and Stone fails to realize this, making his movie an embarrassing propaganda piece without a point.2.5/5 "},{"Title":"Sundance Sucks","Date":"4 July 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":" Why does Sundance air this film on Independence Day....it is an anti-war movie?

This is a well-directed movie and is also one of Tom Cruise's finest acting roles to date.This film is based off a true story based around a Vietnam veteran named Ron Kovic.

She's not a great actress and really not that good-looking either.Overall, this is a very good film about the dangers of American patriotism. I really loved how Kovic's family played a central role in the film and that makes it even more moving. The movie also boasts another great score by legendary composer, John Williams. This is not the best movie based off the Vietnam War, but it only trails The Deer Hunter and Platoon in that department. This is a solid effort by Oliver Stone and people should check this out.

In Born on the Fourth of July, he illuminates the screen intensely as Ron Kovic, a young man who feels that it is his duty to serve his country in the war against communism. After being paralyzed from his second tour of duty, he quickly develops a change of heart as he sees how the war has affected the nation from violent protests and his memories of combat haunt him. In the end, he learns that war brings nothing but sorrow and becomes an anti-war activist. I'm very, very surprised that Tom didn't get his Oscar for this.Another huge factor that helped make the film's power was the cinematography by Robert Richardson. The battle scenes are tinted red, symbolizing blood. The dreams are in white, representing peace. The visions and other scenes of sorrow are blue. All three colors coincide with the American flag. I'm disappointed that this did not get Mr. Richardson his first Oscar. Uhm? The screenplay by Oliver Stone is pretty good, but his powerful direction makes the film more gripping. The score by John Williams is haunting, although some of it reminds me of The Patriot. In addition, the editing and sound was well-equipped.The lack of character support by Willem Dafoe, Frank Whaley, and Kyra Sedgwick did not harm the film too much; however, I felt the movie left some side stories that could have been developed more like Ron's relationship with his girlfriend Donna. But I what bothered me was the unneeded f-bombs. There was hardly a swear word in the first twenty minutes. Then as soon as the war scenes come along, every character has a bigger mouth than Eric Cartman. I also felt some of the scenes of drug use and sex could have been left out. They added nothing to the story, just an increase of the R rating.Nonetheless, I was captivated by this work of Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise. This is the sixth film I have seen made by Oliver Stone.

Up to that point Tom Cruise had done little but Brat Pack style films appealing to his adoring female fans. I think he showed promise as an actor in All The Right Moves and I think Stone saw that film and saw the same thing.As this film opens in 1961 we see young Ron Kovic taking in the words of newly inaugurated president John F. Kennedy about asking what you can do for your country and deciding to enlist in the Marines. Kennedy upped the commitment to 20,000.00 troops as opposed to a few hundred advisers. Later on he might have been rethinking the commitment, but we'll never know and that's a subject for another film. In fact in his JFK film Oliver Stone does touch on that subject.The closest thing to the Vietnam experience that the US ever had was the Filipino insurrection in terms of the type of warfare waged. Not too many were alive in the Sixties who remembered that. The commitment was there, but just who and where was the enemy? Vietnamese wanted to settle their own country's destiny, but like so many others it was caught between the two Cold War rivals. Before he received his wounds that made him a paraplegic Cruise sees a whole lot in Vietnam that makes him wonder just why we're there. But he's a middle class kid from Long Island who's been brought up with certain values among them not to question the aims and intentions of American leadership. After the Vietnam experience the film becomes his realization that he and comrades might not have had any business there in the first place. That's enough to radicalize anyone.Some other performances to single out are Raymond Barry and Caroline Kava as Cruise's parents. Especially Kava who is a strict Catholic and does not allow questioning of anything in her household. Kyra Sedgwick is fine as the girl next door who in the end can't marry him because of what will be lacking in their marriage.On that topic I'm sure Oliver Stone channeled Ernest Hemingway and his creation of Jake Barnes in The Sun Also Rises. How prescient was Papa Hemingway to write of Kovic's experience a couple of generations earlier. One also wonders what Hemingway might have thought of Kovic's experience against his character Barnes.Oliver Stone got a Best Director Oscar for Born On The Fourth Of July and the film also got an Oscar for Editing. Plus a flock of other nominations besides the one for Tom Cruise including Best Picture.Born On The 4th Of July is a valuable piece of cinema and history and a milestone for Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise.

It pays homage to The Best Years of Our Lives and perhaps some other films about vets returning home. But specifically Best Years, I think, with the shot of Ron Kovic after he has become paralyzed and finally returns to his parents' house staring at his high school wrestling picture in his old room. Harold Russell in Best Years does the exact same thing becoming lost in the old picture from his high school athletics career when he felt he was a whole person. Both of these movies deal with men who have lost some part of themselves and have to discover how to gain strength and courage and acceptance to be a whole man again. By exploring Ron's youth, Born on the Fourth of July shows that the story is really about pressure and failure and confusion and how we deal with those things. This is an epic story with a tremendous supporting cast. It's about a boy who becomes a soldier, a soldier who becomes paralyzed, a paraplegic who becomes an outcast all the while searching for his humanity!! Sometimes it takes an outcast to speak the truth, someone who has been paralyzed to really stand for something, a soldier to fight for life, and of course it's the natural progression of things for a boy to triumphantly become a man!

How it escaped even an accidental viewing is, especially considering my thoughts on it in retrospect and my love of war-based cinema, is baffling.What might color the modern viewer who has yet to experience Born, as it did me, was the idea of Tom Cruise portraying a role more down to earth and realistic than we're used to seeing from the actor. Consider also that in 1989 he was just hitting his stride as a cinematic centerpiece along with the blunt force trauma he had to portray as real-life Vietnam veteran Ron Kovac, and the modern viewer is almost assured of having reservations. Watching some of the special features of my copy of the DVD makes me realize that even then, there were reservations about Cruise. At least outside of Oliver Stone and Ron Kovac, who were sold early on.It takes maybe half the film until you start to understand it, but Cruise does sell it, and he sells with more honest integrity than I think he's put into any role in his career. It doesn't surprise me as much considering the room and avenues of expression Oliver Stone has traditionally given to his actors, but it does further cement Cruise as an actor of quality more so than quantity.The film itself, and all of its particulars, offer sharp contrasts, bare humanity and the horrors we're capable of, and the eventual redemption of a man who I do believe, regardless of our own lives, anyone can relate to on some level. It is a story told many times, but this perspective, unique as all perspectives inherently are, is as vital to the entire story of the Vietnam War and ultimately of defining ourselves as any I've ever considered.Whether or not Stone embellishes is not for me to say; I have yet (and I stress 'yet', as I do believe this film will lead me to reading the book Kovac wrote) to explore the particulars. But, in the end, it doesn't matter; the overall message is as clear as can be by the end. This is the story of a young man who believed and who was deceived, only to once again believe. Each step is fittingly littered with personal conflicts and triumphs, intimate encounters with people from various walks of life. It emphasizes the point that our own beliefs, our own deceptions, our own lives are the product of influence. What we perceive from our families, our friends, our media, inevitably colors our choices in life. For Kovac, these choices led to a swirling chaos of negative consequences. These negative consequences ultimately lead to the redeeming aspects of his later life, but the truth is always there, and it's an ugly truth. A haunting truth, brought to life by haunting moments.What keeps me from considering this film as more than very good is an inherent disconnect of generations. While my generation will perhaps look back on our current conflicts in the Middle East the same way the Vietnam generation looks at their own conflicts and struggles, Oliver Stone was and, with Born, is a part of a generation that I am not. His perspective is not hard to relate to, but it is hard to understand.Beyond that, the film has a handful of small issues that feel more like nitpicking but can't be avoided. The cinematography, while advanced for its time, doesn't lend itself as much to intimacy as it does to the swirl of conflict surrounding Kovac and America. The viewer often feels so swept up in the background that it can be difficult to spot and hone in on the essential point of specific scenes. Also, while I applaud Cruise's efforts in his role, he and several other actors are still either miscast or underutilized in my estimation. The storytelling of Oliver Stone, while easy to digest once the film is finished, is choppy and inconsistent, and I felt that certain moments were not given the emphasis they deserved in the overall story of Ron Kovac.Despite the small flaws, I can't imagine nor have I witnessed a better overall portrayal of a war-torn life and the dirt, grime, pain and suffering that must be carried throughout such a life than this film offers. The gritty realism holds up even today, a time where we can often find more harrowing images on our local news than in this film. There is no individual scene or moment that defines Born On The Fourth Of July; it is a journey that resonates most strongly at its bittersweet conclusion.

After the success of Platoon, writer/director Oliver Stone kept his promise to Ron Kovic that if he ever broke as a director he would make his film. Born On The Fourth Of July is the story of Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic and spans three decades(50's, 60's and 70's). From his youth as all American boy who joined the Marines to fight communism in Vietnam to his life at home as a veteran paralyzed from the waist down. Charlie Sheen was originally cast by Oliver Stone to play Ron Kovic, but at the last minute Stone chose to cast Tom Cruise instead. This caused a rift between Sheen and Stone and they did not talk or work together for many years. In my opinion Charlie would have been great, but the film would be different also. As much as the film is about Ron Kovic coming to terms with his injury and changing his thoughts about the war, it also is about how poorly the veterans got treated when they came home. I would also say it has a lot to say about how polarized American society was about the war. Most of Ron Kovic's experiences were horrible and Oliver Stone did not shy away from that one bit as it would diminish the impact of the film. Born On The Fourth Of July has one of Tom Cruise's finest performances and Oliver Stone won his second Oscar for best director. There also are cameos from Platoon's cast , most notably Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe. Great movie in my opinion, thumbs up for sure.

Oliver Stone has an incredible view for politic and war movies, especially when it comes to pain and reality, and this film has both, so it makes the film, in few words, Shocking and WonderfulAND... In conclusion, it is one of the best works of Oliver Stone and one of the most surprising about Vietnam, but not really comparing with others, it's just, Beautiful, and YES, I'm completely recommending it.

Emotionally disturbed, Ron Kovic is a character which you invest fully in and have trouble watching him go through hell during his life. In the end, though he manages to pull through and rise back up. The movie starts with him growing up in a small town during the 1950's and 60's, in which he learns the values of the time. As the Vietnam war approaches, he enlists in the marines believing this to be his duty as an American. But soon after he his crippled by the enemy, Ron will return to a home changed by the effects of the war he was fighting, creating a conflict between everything he believed in and the wave of dis contempt that rages on around him. Despite it's heavily talked about context, let's not forget that this is a story about one individual and how reacted to these events. Ron Kovic was a man that descended to the bottom and within him found the strenght necessary to reclaim his lost dignity. On the filmmaking side of things, Oliver Stone once again delivers his intense directing style and with the usual sharp editing, a riveting script and another classic score from John Williams, the movie is technically brilliant. The divisive story is, for me, an inspirational one and I find it sad that some people don't see this because of their political views.Rating 8,5/10 "},{"Title":"Cruise Control drives home the point","Date":"2 June 2014","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":" I recently rewatched this film because of all the recent VA hospital mistreatment issues of vets. It really reminded me of how good this movie was, led by an awesome job by Cruise, and a powerful directing job and screenplay by Oliver Stone. The film portrays the real life story of Ron Kovic, whose life on Long Island thrives on religion, hard work, and patriotism. He volunteers to go to Vietnam, when certainly the majority of young kids were starting to turn against the war. The film leads you through some confusing scenes with all the horrors of war you can imagine. Cruise starts his deep dive into the dark spots in his mind that he never wanted to visit. He starts doubting his choice, his whole basis for life.Cruise/Kovic returns to an uninterested and uncaring country. He does a terrific job of portraying Kovic struggling with just everything. Finally Kovic decides that he can be a patriot, but be against a war that he so loyally believed in, and gave his physical being to support.Amazing performance. Not much supporting cast is the only negative, though Willem Defoe plays a wounded buddy he meets while trying to come to grips with the aftermath in a drunken visit to Mexico. I hope Cruise wins an Academy award someday - he really deserves it for roles like this where he should have gotten a nod, or the many other fine roles he turned in, like in Rainman or that Jerry Maquire movie as a football agent. If you want to revisit the 60s and 70s with vivid realism, and a bit of overdoing by Oliver Stone, watch Born on the 4th of July. Watch the archive special feature with an in person interview with Kovic and Brian Gumbel - pretty good stuff too. Enjoy.

Born on the Fourth of July is to show the brutality of war, and turn an over-patriotic pro-war American into realizing he has been wrong all along.Ron Kovic is the typical Cold War American kid loves the United States, hates Communism, and wants to fight the Commie Reds if he ever got the chance to. He grows up liking war as a kid. However, he knows for a fact that every time he seen American WW2 veterans marching down the street on July 4th that he wanted to be in the military. Finally, when the United States throws itself in Vietnam, Ron immediately wants to enlist. He leaves behind the girl he likes, friends, and family in place for the U.S. Marines. When he is sent over he can't wait for action. However, being a sergeant, Ron orders his squad to clear out a village the Marines just shot the crap out of. This involves him and his squad being ambushed and begin shooting back. They then find out that among the Vietnamese casualties they inflicted were civilians. Ron is surprised that he took part in killing innocent people, but then is ordered by his superiors to retreat as a Viet Cong advancement starts. When they back out of the town the battle becomes confusing, and when a fellow Marine steps out of the fog Ron shoots him, mistaking him for being a charging Viet Cong soldier. Ron then reports to the Lieutenant for what happened about killing civilians and friendly fire, but the Lt. says They got in the way. It's not your fault and You didn't shoot your own man, refusing to acknowledge.Later on patrol, Ron and other Marines are ambushed, and he gets paralysed in the spine and shot in the foot. Afterward he is sent to a battlefield hospital where he thinks he is going to die. He is then sent back to the United States to spend his time in a down-ridden and ugly hospital for Vietnam veterans. This is good that the producers exemplified this as it shows how the U.S. government poorly treated those who fought in the Vietnam War.Even though being told that he cannot walk again and through the injustices of war he experienced, Ron still holds true his patriotic views of the United States and Marines. A lot of the times he begins to feel how the government is essentially treating them in the poor hospital conditions and uses the War as a way to get attention. Pretty much he says stuff like I deserve better because I fought for my country, I'm a Vietnam Vet. Now, of course Vietnam Vets deserved to be treated better, but Ron still doesn't ridicule the War or government. He uses it as a way to seem like a hero, just the WW2 veterans he seen as a kid.He returns home hoping to be seen as a hero to everyone. Ron sees how the U.S. has changed anti-war riots and people burning flags and vowing for peace. Nothing about kill the Commies, or trump on Vietnam and defeat the Soviets. Ron also finds out that his brother has become an anti-war person and shows strong resentment for. As well, Ron sees the effect of the war on how life was before having his legs and not being paralysed. He also sees how different the people receive him as a hero on Independence Day by yelling anti-war slogans. After having a fight with a WW2 vet who shown no sympathy for saying Shove your Vietnam war up your a-- (because Ron tried sound patriotic because he took part in a war) he gets into a fight with his family by confessing he killed innocent people, and defying the religious values he was taught as a kid.Ron decides to go to a Mexican village where many other Vietnam Vets have gone to relax. He meets up with a fellow Vet in a wheelchair and both decide the Mexican village has no worth for them and want to travel some place else, but get stranded and fight against each other. However, they hitch a ride with a truck driver who drives them back to the same village they came from. After this Ron goes to Georgia and stops by the Marine's family's house who he killed in Vietnam. Ron explains to the family and widow that it was a confusing time in the battle and did not truly mean to kill Wilson, the Marine's name. Wilson's parents forgive him, especially the father who was a WW2 veteran and understands the confusing time of war. But, Wilson's wife says she can't forgive him, but hopes God can.From there, Ron goes to Florida to protest with the Vietnam Vets Against the War (VVAW). He tells the fellow veterans his story and why he now hates the government and the war, but not his country. Republican supporters try to silence Ron and the VVAW for their anti-war slogans, even if they haven't gone to war but the people in the VVAW have and know what they are talking about. After being kicked out, Ron writes a book named Born on the Fourth of July, and the movie ends with him speaking to crowd about how the Vietnam War was wrong, mirroring how earlier as a child his mother said I see you speaking to a large group of people saying great things. This movie is absolutely good, and shows how ridiculous it is to support war, or a country who doesn't care about those who were physically or mentally wounded from it. Ron went from a pro-war American who thought like it or leave it to resenting the American government for its pro-war agenda to supposedly fight Communism without caring much for the actual young men who are sent to fight the wars.

The film is based on the true story of Ron Kovic, who enthusiastically bought into the militaristic propaganda peddled by Army recruiters, and enlisted in the military to serve his country in Vietnam. Once there he kills a fellow soldier in a friendly fire incident following the murder of Vietnamese civilians, and then he himself is almost killed in the firefight. The film takes us through his recovery process, both physically and ideologically, as Kovic suffers through the bureaucratic failings of the VA health care system, and begins to see that he was fooled, starting early in life, into supporting a criminal imperialistic nation. It's a powerful film about discovering the truth hidden behind propaganda and the political awakening that results when you stop living in denial and follow the truth to its logical conclusions. Born on the Fourth of July is Stone at his most effective, balancing his bold artistic sensibilities with a well crafted narrative, and Tom Cruise turns in one of his career's best performances in a role that showed why he is a major acting talent as well as Hollywood's biggest star.
