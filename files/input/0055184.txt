[{"Title":"A Lesson in Film","Date":"1 August 2003","Score":"92 out of 119 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":"  This once nearly forgotten movie, the last film of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe is now coming forward in the lexicon of film history as an underrated gem.  Universally misunderstood for the most part at the time it came out it is clear now that this film was at least five of six years ahead of it's time. It fits in more comfortably with films of the late 60's and early 70's.     The screenplay by Miller is one of his most striking works. A story of a group of people lost in the wide expanse of the West in search of the discarded souls of their misspent lives. The film's beautiful cinematography by Russell Metty stands out as superb artistry at the demise of the black and white era. It shimmers with the silver of the deep expanse of the desert and the flat grays and blacks of the distant mountains upon which the last act of the story plays. The music by Alex North is among his best work and gives a savage punch to the aerial scenes and the round up at the end of the wild mustangs.   Montgomery Clift, by now sliding into the last years of his life is touching in his performance of Perce. His broken cowboy with the broken heart is almost painful to watch. His phone call home to his mother is among some of his best work.  Eli Wallach gives a strong deeply moving portrait of Guido who has lost his wife, his way, and his humanity. He shines in his scene with Monroe where he asks her to save him. When she can't to at least say `Hello Guido'.   Thelma Ritter is, well, Thelma Ritter in yet another of her excellent character roles. Ritter is the master of the one line wisecrack but here as Isobel she laces the cracks with an underlying sadness and vulnerability.  As Gay Langland, Clark Gable gives what I consider to be the best performance of his career.  It was a brave move for Gable to take on the role of what on the surface seems another one of his typical macho made to fit parts. But as the story unfolds from Arthur Miller's pen Gay reveals that beneath his gruff, not a care in the world, cowboy is a man in deep pain and despair at his losses. The world has left him behind. Abandoned by his children the drunken Gable breaks so violently it is a shock to watch the great man fall. This is Clark Gable at his finest ever.  Marilyn Monroe gives an astounding performance as Roslyn Tabler the newly divorced dancer. A damaged woman who finds in the company of these three men something to finally believe in, something to stand up and fight for, she finds life. It is a performance ground out in part from her own person and experience and in part by the director John Huston and the editor George Tomasini who helped a nearly destroyed Monroe create her stunning Roslyn. This, her last performance is her best and the true example of the collaborative creation that film really is. That Marilyn under the circumstances of her life at that time could be so good is a testament to her talent as an actress and a star. Watch her when she is listening to the other actors. This is where she shines; this is the true mark of a great screen actor. To be able to listen and draw you into the inner life of the character through that deceptively simple act of listening and reaction is her gift to the audience.  Her scene with Monty in back of the bar, sitting on a pile of trash, her afore mentioned scene with Eli Wallach in the speeding car. These are but a few of the examples in this film of her great talent. In the 1950's and early 60's there were only a handful of great young actresses in film, Elizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn Monroe where at the summit of the small mountain.

The title refers to the wild mustangs they hunt, but it also describes the 4 main characters, each lost in a world they hardly recognize. At one point Monroe points to a mountain vista and says it's like a dream. Each of the characters is wounded and lost in some way. Marilyn Monroe plays a divorcée trying to figure out what to do next. Clark Gable plays a cowboy in a vanishing west. Montgomery Clift plays a rancher cheated out of his legacy when his mother remarries. Eli Wallach plays a guy whose life has come to a standstill after the death of his wife. The characters circle each other, trying to make connections, but their timing is always off. Gable and Monroe seem to find something until they go on the mustang hunt.Gable is magnificent as the aging cowboy who fears working for wages as the final sign of giving in to the commonplace and losing the old west. But the old west is, of course, already lost. Most of the action takes place in and around Reno, the perfect symbol for what the west has become. His drunk scene (after he has seen his kids) is astonishing in its pain and ugliness. It's a great performance.Monroe is stunning and gives a quiet and simple performance that shows what she could have done (had she lived). Leaving her dumb blonde persona in the dust, what we get here is Monroe the actress, and she's just plain terrific. Aside from the scene (done in a long shot) where she rages at the men after they have captured the horses, Monroe plays this character very quietly and with lots of small reactions (watch her eyes). It's a great performance.Clift and Wallach do wonders with their characters and provide a lot of the tension since all three men pursue Monroe. Thelma Ritter is solid as Isabelle. Estelle Winwood has an odd role as the old lady collecting money. James Barton and Kevin McCarthy have small roles.I think THE MISFITS is a must see for any serious film buff. The film collapsed under the weight of its publicity in 1961 and there was a huge backlash when Gable died within 2 weeks of finishing the film. Yet the film is gorgeous, a shimmering Arthur Miller poem to the worlds and people we've lost.

It happened just before Election Day because there was a news item and it's mentioned in at least one Gable biography that he voted by absentee ballot in 1960. Shortly after that he died and the world was waiting the birth of his son and his last posthumous film.No doubt about it Gable does look all of his 59 years in the Misfits. But he's still exudes that gruff animal magnetism that leaves you no doubt as to why Marilyn Monroe was finding him so sexy. It's an interesting and challenging role for Gable, his Gay Langland is a bitter multi-layered character, whose family has deserted him and his way of life is vanishing. All three of the men, Gable, Monty Clift, and Eli Wallach have a deathly fear of working for wages expressed often during The Misfits.For Monty Clift it's more than fear. He's also bitter about being cheated out of his father's ranch by a stepfather who offers him wages. So he's taken to the rodeo circuit, but he's also past his prime in that dangerous sport. Eli Wallach starts out as what we think is a deep sensitive portrayal, but as we go along we find there's less than meets the eye. He wants Marilyn Monroe real bad (who wouldn't) and it's clear he's just using some of his best lines in his quest for her.Marilyn as eastern divorcée to be serves as the group's conscience when they start going after mustangs for dog food manufacturers. Quite illegally of course, but that's part of the challenge for this group. Lots of shots of Marilyn's bulges both front and rear are another good reason to see this film.Towards the end the wild mustangs on the Nevada desert take over the film from the human actors. They are a kind of doppleganger for this group, they are also misfits with no place in the modern world for them except as canned dog food.Those roping stunts and Clark Gable being dragged by a horse probably put a strain on his cardiovascular system. It's been written that Marilyn was the cause of his demise. Pure and utter nonsense. I can't believe John Huston the director let him do those scenes. Why wasn't a stunt double used? Marilyn Monroe was one royal pain to work with, what with all of her issues, but that surely had nothing to do with what happened to Gable.The Misfits still holds up well after over 40 years. All of the cast can be proud of their work in that film.

It brings the two famous stars into the then current year of 1961.This is a movie about a woman in Reno, Nevada (where else?) who is there to get a divorce.  On a whim (she makes up her mind fast!) she drives out to the desert on the day of her divorce with a washed out aging cowboy (Clark Gable) and his buddy (Eli Wallach) as well as her friend (Thelma Ritter).  This begins a wistful adventure and sometimes sad relationship for her with the cowboy and his misfit friends (including Montgomery Clift).  They grapple with life's issues from divorce, friendship, greed and even cruelty until finally, everyone's character and philosophy of life is laid bare in a showdown over 6 wild horses.This is an underrated cinematic gem...and I can see why.  The first time I saw this movie a few years ago I thought it was beautiful and well done but sad and too depressing with a vague ending.  Recently, I couldn't pass it by because of it's place in movie history when I saw it on DVD for just $5.88!  What a shock I got watching this one on my big screen TV in the original widescreen format in glorious black and white.  It was so fantastically fascinating from beginning to end that I watched it twice in a row.  Marilyn Monroe is an amazing actress and she brings Rosalyn Tabor to life in this film.  She's riveting and not because of her fantastic looks.  What a thrill!  Clark Gable inhabits his character Gay like he's in his own skin, making him a man you can respect and sympathize with.  Montgomery Clift, Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter are all incredible in their roles.  I don't know how I missed so much the first time I saw this move.  It has humor, pathos and drama.  The great John Houston directs it brilliantly! The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the editing is sheer genius.  It's an overlooked cinematic gem and I recommend it!  Watch it twice if you're don't see the joy and hope in this film the first time.  It's there!  This crew hs created a near mastepiece.  Keep following that same bright star.  I rate this a 91/100.  Don't miss seing it in the widescreen format on a big screen TV.

It is without question the most barren of places in terms of the sustenance of human life, yet it has a rare beauty that transcends the ugliness of its  crass cities and radioactive vistas.  The fact that it encompasses an entirely landlocked basin in which great rivers roar down to disappear in dry lakebeds speaks to the main point.  Pristine alpine meadows form islands in the sky surrounded by millions of acres of desolation.When I first saw The Misfits in 1961, after having read the savage reviews and followed the sensational press coverage of its production, my initial reaction was that most people just missed the point.  I still think so, particularly after reading some of the negative comments here that parrot accepted wisdom about filmmaking in general and what is perceived as a misfire by Miller and Huston.  But I have news for the naysayers this film tells it like it is.So what if it's a stage play set in the desert?  So what if the characters devolve and come apart according to some apparently hidden hand of random fate?  Those who get the story right are those who see past what seem at first to be surreal clichés existing only as fodder for the cameras and instead grasp the horror and ugliness of what passes as everyday life for the eponymous ensemble.  Nothing happens, and yet everything happens.Gable, Monroe, Clift.  Arthur Miller himself.  Figures that seem larger than life.  This has little to do with horses and everything to do with the tragedy of Everyman.

I can't say it is an entertaining movie, but it is certainly profound and stays with you.Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift were all wonderful.  There is something extra poignant about the casting of these three actors.  It is like misfits playing misfits.  Knowing that it is Clark Gable's and Marilyn Monroe's last film added to the aura of finality at the end. Marilyn Monroe definitely does not get the credit she deserves as the fine actress she was.  Even her character is trying to get beyond the external first impression she makes on men.It is the first film I've seen of Montgomery Clift's.  What a fine actor! He brought enormous depth to his character--much of which was portrayed without speaking.Once again, if you're looking for an entertaining film, you may be disappointed.  If you're looking for an interesting blend of characters who, in many ways, are mirrors of the actors playing them, then rent the Misfits. It is packed with stars but not with glitzy star quality, just no-holds-barred, uninhibited acting.

There are many great moments in the film, the most famous being her tirade against the cruelty and dishonesty of the men in her life.  You will never forget her cries of Murderers! , even more horrifying now, given the suspicions surrounding her death. But for me the most unforgettable moment takes place in the cab of the truck when Eli Wallach's character offers to save the lives of some horses if she will give up the man she is with and live with him. The look on her face changes from hope to horror as she realizes he's bartering the horses' lives for hers You have to GET something in order to act human?! she spits out at him.

Prophetically in its doomness - personal doomness that is. Arthur Miller writes, unwittingly, his wife's swan song and she sings it with a combination of uppers and downers. Pay attention to Eli Wallach describing Marilyn to Clark Gable. Was that Miller himself being particularly misogynistic or what hell was it? She talks about herself, they all talk about her. She is a hurricane right in the middle of a human storm. Montgomery Clift seems to be talking about himself too. The whole bloody thing is really close to the knuckle. Arid, depressing, slow and yet, riveting, funny, mesmerizing. The Misfits should be seen for a variety of reasons but to see Gable and Monroe sharing a black and white screen a short time before their deaths is an experience on itself.

Despite having a poor box office and mixed reviews, it is now highly regarded among modern critics. It is about a restless fragile divorcée finding a new life in Reno with a couple of cowboys, one of which has a gambling problem and survives on slaughtering mustangs to make dog food.Not only does this showcase Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable's exceptional (and often underestimated) talent, but it is a very beautiful movie that lingers on in your mind long after you have finished watching it. Personally it has affected me a lot, especially the horse sequence. I know this was essential to the film but as an animal lover and vegetarian I found it very distressing - in fact incredibly distressing seeing the horses being treated that way for the sake of the movie. Nevertheless, it added to the movie and when they were set free, it was the most magnificent moment in the movie. Marilyn's screaming part was also very beautiful, I felt her frustration completely.The Misfits is a very suitable title as it refers to both the poor horses caught up in the web of human greed and also to the restless humans, unsatisfied and cruel.This is a very moving movie, showing the cruelness of human nature and a most realistic portrayal of human life, both the positive and the negative. I was so astounded by both Marilyn and Clark's acting, plus the magnificent script which was so very intelligent, magnificent quotes. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.

Some were burnt at the stake, long ago; others still tramp the dark streets of our cites. But, like everybody, they had and still have their beliefs. So, while this intense drama is about a group of people who seem oddball, it's really all about people &#150; just like you and me &#150; trying to figure what to believe in...And, it just so happens that Arthur Miller used the American cowboy as his metaphor to explore that central human concern. (As an aside, I found out that Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay while in Reno waiting for his divorce to be finalized; significantly, the film opens with the character of Roslyn getting her divorce from an abusive husband).There's the delightful Marilyn Monroe (as Roslyn Taber) in her next to last movie, trying to find a man worthy enough to believe in; Clark Gable in his last movie (as Gay Langland) the restless, older cowboy &#150; resourceful, independent, strong, but with a touch of cynicism &#150; who's attracted to Roslyn despite himself; the always vulnerable Montgomery Clift (as Perce Howland), who drifts from rodeo to rodeo, trying to forget his past; and then there's the ever-present Eli Wallach &#150; one of Hollywood's greatest &#150; playing the widower (Guido) who can't forget his past, but for all the wrong reasons.All three men are, of course, attracted to Roslyn, and all the while Thelma Ritter (as Isabelle Stears, and an older friend of Roslyn's) tries to help her sort out what she should do.Together the group stay for a while at Guido's unfinished house, out near the Nevada desert, and it is there that Roslyn decides she will try to live with Gay for a while, to see if things work out for them both. But, it is only when she accompanies all three men on a camping foray into the desert, to round up some mustangs, that Roslyn finds out what all three men truly believe in. When she does find out, she's no happy camper (no pun intended), that's for sure &#150; except in the case of Perce.The stark black and white camera work, especially in the desert night, is hauntingly beautiful, reminding me very much of the photography in Pursued (1947), perhaps still the finest example of Western night filming. The action during the hunt for the mustangs is intense, grueling and exhausting. So much so, that the viewer can almost feel it. And the editing is just excellent as the cowboys bring down each horse, one by one, leaving the stallion to last, in a final great tussle (in a Clark Gable biographical documentary I saw, I found out that he did much of the heavy work in those scenes; no mean feat for an aging star in his sixtieth year. Sadly, of course, Gable did have a heart attack two days after filming ended and died nine days later).If you haven't seen this classic film, I think you should. Not only Gable's best, in my opinion, but also one of the best of John Huston's directorial efforts.

It's mostly exposition, back-story, some of which could have been edited out. The plot rambles and meanders. There is a lot of glib talk, a lot of filler. The cameraman seems to be asleep. The characters themselves are dispirited, drifting emotionally, buffeted by the storms of life. They whine a lot. Booze helps them cope. The film score is sad, sentimental, and sounds like it was borrowed from a Douglas Sirk melodrama.Then, as the film enters its final thirty minutes, things change. The pace quickens. The dialogue subsides somewhat. The cameraman wakes up. Drama and tension escalate. The most memorable scenes occur in this final Act, on the bleak, empty salt flats, where the characters confront a herd of wild horses, which in turn forces the characters to confront their own inner wildness. Here at the finale, the B&W visuals transcend human effort. The simple dialogue soars to eloquence. How do you find your way back in the dark?, asks Marilyn Monroe's character. Comes the response Just head for that big star, straight on. Cut to a shot of the vast empty landscape on a clear night, with eyes looking upward, an intuition of eternity.How ironic these last scenes are. Back in 1960 no one could have known that the film's powerful ending would symbolize such a prescient real-life ending to the careers of two Hollywood legends. "},{"Title":"Grossly under-appreciated.

The opening credits, with its uncertain, uneasy score by Alex North, sets the tone. The modernist, Matisse-like puzzle pieces that won't fit each other sets the theme. This ain't gonna be no cowboy movie and it sure ain't gonna be no comedy (despite the categorization by IMDb, even the comic relief scenes are immersed in pathos). The Misfits, directed by John Huston (The Maltese Falcon, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Key Largo, Wise Blood, et al.), stars Clark Gable and Marylin Monroe--both in their last movies before they died--and Montgomery Clift, soon to be another Hollywood tragedy. The story and screenplay were written by Arthur Miller (The Crucible), who was married to Monroe at the time, and had her in mind for the role of Roslyn. Monroe certainly gives the performance of her career, and Gable, although panned by critics at the time, does as well. He called his performance his best ever, because Huston, in his typical fashion, was hands off, and allowed him to push himself.The dialogue is outstanding. In one scene, while driving through the Nevada desert, Isabelle, Roslyn's older friend and played by Thelma Ritter, says,Cowboys are the last real men in the world, and they're about as reliable as jackrabbits. Roslyn replies,Is anybody any different? Maybe you're not supposed to believe what people say. Maybe it's not even fair to them.The overlay of the theme of the death of the Old West--it's 1961 and the men are still chasing mustangs in the desert, which leads to the gripping climax scene--gives the whole thing a Cormac McCarthyesque feel. A grossly under-appreciated film. Highly recommended.

It was the final film for Clark Gable. Indeed, it killed Gable due to the scene where he stupidly did his own stunt of trying to restrain a wild horse. However, it was not the last film for Marilyn Monroe. She began work on a film with George Cukor which she was fired from and which was never completed. Since Monty Clift was also in it many people claim it was his last film too. Actually he made several complete films after it, including FREUD (also by John Huston). Thelma Ritter lived until 1969, and she was still making plenty of films until then. Estelle Winwood would reach her 100th year, and was still making films up to a decade before that. As for Kevin McCarthy and Eli Wallach - they are both ('bless 'em) going strong. However the final scene of the script gave a coda to Gable's and Monroe's career. This helps make the public point of view about the film understandable. In his later years, Gable popped up in a series of films where his co-star was a leading lady of similar popular following, who was usually younger than him but his feminine sexual equivalent. These included TEACHER'S PET (with Doris Day) and IT STARTED IN NAPLES (with Sophia Loren). The film he did with Monroe (their only film together) was THE MISFITS, and it was not a comedy. THE MISFITS was supposed to be a philosophical drama about why people can't be loners but have to find their way into some group where they are acceptable to each other. Philosophical films are very difficult ones to turn into box office gold. People go to films as an escape and rarely to feed their brains. But Marilyn's then husband (dramatist Arthur Miller) wrote the screenplay for the film. At the time the Miller-Monroe marriage was collapsing, and this may be why the screenplay seems to be lopsided. Marilyn's character Rosalind Taber seems to be flighty at points, but at other points too deep. We first see her willing to get through her divorce with Kevin McCarthy (who does a lot with his one brief scene in the film trying to stop the divorce). This shows determination - she even gives a vague reason to McCarthy that it was his fault for keeping her on the shelf while he concentrated on his career. Yet she shows a flakiness too. She tells Thelma Ritter she never wants to see an expensive car that was given to her again.This follows her throughout the film. She is introduced to these modern cowboys through cab driver Eli Wallach (Guido), and she takes an offer from him to go up to his country house to chill out. Gable and Ritter accompany them. But soon she is showing a different personality she is a mother-earth figure. Wallach is an ex military pilot who was married, but whose wife died in a fluke situation while pregnant (his car lacked a tire, and he could not rush her to the hospital). Marilyn tries to get to the bottom of Wallach's feelings and it is obvious that Wallach does not want to discuss this. Gable (Gay Langdon) seems more settled - but we learn that daughter and son keep him at arm's length due to his tendency to carouse and get drunk. Marilyn and Gable do turn each other on, but Marilyn is upset by Gable's matter-of-fact feelings about animals like horses and rabbits.Montgomery Clift (Perce Howland) comes in later in the film when he joins the group headed for a rodeo. All of them have attended rodeos except Monroe. She is horrified at the injuries the cowboys get. Clift gets injured but while he and the other men accept his injuries as normal, Monroe wants to scream about them. Clift also has personal family problems his mother remarried and the man has basically pushed Clift out of his property rights to his father's ranch. But the lack of his mother's interest in him (she is totally enthralled by the new husband) is what hurts him the most.Even the fifth wheel of this ensemble, Ritter (Isabelle Steers) has a serious family problem that makes her a misfit (albeit one who has learned to accept it). Her husband left her for a best friend of her's years before, and has never paid her alimony - he sends her a potted rose once a year. At the end she leaves the film before the conclusion she meets the husband and her best friend at the rodeo, and they go to her home to spend a few days! Ritter's character is a realist when she is not involved - she keeps warning Marilyn about cowboys and their ways - but she can be remarkably weak in defending her own rights and feelings.How they all come to terms (or fail to come to terms) with their family and personality failures is what I leave to the viewers. It is worthwhile to watch this film to it's emotional climax (the scene with the wild horses), where Monroe's character finally gets her real voice - and Monroe achieved her acting height outside of her performance as Cherie in BUS STOP). But it is achieved at a ridiculous cost as mentioned before Gable had to do his own stunt in that scene. The follow-up scene really shows how he was too old for it.There is also that lovely coda Clark and Marilyn in the pick-up truck looking at the star in the sky that Clark says is his guide. It does sort of seem an appropriate sign-off for those two movie icons.

The Misfits is one such film. I've watched it twice now and am preparing to watch it a third time. There are so many layers of fascination here, that it's hard to separate them out.As a self-acknowledged Marilyn Monroe admirer, I sometimes identify with Elton John collaborator Bernie Taupin's claim that I, too, see her as something more than sexual, though I must admit that it's sexuality that best defines our Norma Jean. There is nothing wrong with sexuality. It is, quite possibly, the most common of human traits. But there is something in Monroe's sexuality that goes well beyond that articulated through her popular image. There have been many Monroe pretenders but none has quite captured the underlying vulnerability that could only have come from something, not contrived, but inherent in her nature. After viewing this film, I'm convinced that Arthur Miller, that most insightful of mid-20th Century American playwrights, must have examined it up close and been as fascinated as the rest of us at its mystifying origin. I have no doubt that Miller wrote this screenplay for his then estranged wife. He wondered at her unpredictability, her wildness, her revulsion at being roped in and ground up for mass consumption. All this must have contrasted strangely with the popular assumption that America's Blonde Bombshell must be little more than a dumb dolt with nothing more complicated than gold-digging on her mind. Miss Monroe's character, Roslyn, is what some might call a touchstone. An emblem of unfathomable beauty, a sometimes overly credulous sentimentality, and painful vulnerability. She, above all else in this picture -- beyond the cowboys, the mountains and the mustangs -- is the mythical character, a woman whose grace transcends her flaws, whose manifested ideals, however unsophisticated to the sophisticated eye, move the people in her life at least to glimpse, if never conquer, their own foibles. As has become my custom with these old films, I watched at least once, then looked up old reviews to see how my own impressions mesh with opinions of the times. It's an exercise of sorts, to see how time has treated these old icons, and an intellectual excursion as well, to match my own perceptions against the pros. In this case, the New York Times review by Bosley Crowther, dated Feb. 2, 1961, caused a particular reaction. It's not unusual that I'd disagree with a critic, but this one seemed to illustrate how critics can go so fantastically wrong. Crowther appeared to connect not at all with the film, its characters, or even the theme it sought to convey. Mr. Crowther, mockingly, ironically, perhaps sincerely, though I doubt it, commends the characters in The Misfits as something other than status seekers or organization men. He says this is the one thing he can say for them, though I suspect he says this with an undercurrent of dismissal, rather than the compliment he feigns. In the end, he calls them 'tramps, as though grasping at any trace of recognition for creatures he's never himself encountered outside of a cursory pass at the fringes of some Manhattan sidewalk. Not that I begrudge Crowther his world view. Though, I must admit a smidgen of resentment at the shear power of its expression, given the vehicle (the NY Times) of its export.I can't help but feel that Crowther, and others like him, may have played some small role in Monroe's demise. Like the character she plays in Misfits, the story of Norma Jean's life was the search for acceptance -- first, by any means possible, and at the end, for something deeper than the skin for which she'd become so famous. I could forgive Crowther more easily if he'd simply said These are tragic characters, their mundane lives rendered masterfully, by an ensemble of stars who'd long ago abandoned the every-day for 'stardom.' It will never play in New York, but, isn't it interesting they inhabit a world New Yorkers long for but could never really want? This is a great movie for what it tries to say. Does it succeed? I've yet to see one succeed more completely. And that is incomplete praise, I know. But, the true stories of the West have been left mostly untold. So, Mr. Huston and company must be acknowledged for trying, and trying so passionately to express the tales of misfit cowboys, discarded women, and goddesses in mortal flesh who descend to deliver a message of honesty, and intimacy, and compassion.

The Misfits, written by Monroe's ex-husband Arthur Miller, is as harsh and dark as his relationship with the actress apparently was. While over-written and plodding, the dialog has an earthy reality that seeps out from time to time, aided in no small way by John Huston's excellent direction and stunning cinematography. Marilyn's equally iconic co-stars &#150;&#150; Clark Gable, Montgomery Clift, Eli Wallach, Thelma Ritter &#150;&#150; realize their parts with finesse and feeling. But Monroe stands out in this modern day, psychological western &#150; not for her beauty or glamor &#150;&#150; but for a contemplative strength and tragic emotion the actress seldom revealed on screen. She seemed to be emerging from her sex-pot shell in her impersonation of a drifting divorcée drawn to a trio of struggling, yet oddly aimless, Nevada ranch hands. Her expressions and mannerisms are natural, at times weighted with a sadness, a tiredness that may not have been acting at all. Whether intentional or not, these facial shots of grief and pain are exquisitely disturbing, as much for their fleshing out Marilyn's personal travail at the time the movie was made as for the mixed-up character she was playing.Her sensitivity to the plight of the wild horses the ranchers are capturing and killing for illegal profit, is brilliantly well-paced, her anguished dialog in defense of their freedom evocative of larger social issues coming to the fore in the 1960s. The poignant scenes of her outrage at the men's treatment of the horses are in fact seething in their intensity, giving the viewer a tantalizing glimpse of the caliber of talent Marilyn held in reserve, and would likely have expressed to greater acclaim had she lived longer. As it turned out, The Misfits, with all its pathos and desolation, underscored by sweeping desert backdrops, was Monroe's last film. Perhaps unavoidably, it's regarded by many as a metaphor for Marilyn's own professional and private turmoil.And it may be. But it's also a splendid tribute to the range of her abilities. More than any other movie in which she appeared, the hauntingly heroic, if flawed, tale of The Misfits is the finest, most compellingly honest work Marilyn Monroe ever achieved.

This collaboration between acclaimed playwright Arthur Miller and director John Huston, while not without flaw, is a consistently engaging study of the inevitable death by degrees of the faux values of the American Dream.Guys like Gay (Clark Gable) are littered throughout small towns across North America - these are folks who remember how it 'Used to Be,' and who feel lost in the New World Order, where the sort of machismo that manifests itself in wrestling 800 pound stallions to the ground single-handedly is no longer a ruling concern. Gay's mantra, `Better than wages, ain't it?' is a paean to a simpler time when free men didn't have to work for The Man, but could take care of themselves, thanks very much.Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe), on the other hand, is a more rare bird flighty and sensuous, beautiful and beaten, she is this world's canary in the coalmine. This is easily Monroe's finest work in a serious role, a tremulous and delicate performance. Gay and Roslyn are an unlikely pair, but it is the nature of The Misfits' philosophical fatalism that they are thrust together, their discordant outlooks providing conflict and hinting at thematic resolution.The Misfits was the last film of its stars Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, and they couldn't have asked for a better send-off. Gable, looking gaunt and time-ravaged, manhandles the role of Gay with his devilish good looks and disarming charm. To play Roslyn, it is clear that Monroe held up a mirror, as she plays the part with the nervousness and flightiness of a wild mustang. She conveys such tangible sensitivity to other's pain that you don't have to be Kreskin to foresee her sad fate.

And the answers don't come easy for her. She's a true misfit. I do identify with that.See the flick and come telling me Marilyn wasn't the best actor movie history has seen. Look at the expressions of frustration on her face. See how she goes through pain. There's not a trace of dumb blonde (the role she played out so perfectly) there.The Misfits is not an easy movie to watch. It's not crowd-pleasing. It requires you to focus. But once you do focus it will reward you. Marilyn is the heart and soul of The Misfits. Being a true misfit herself, she knew how to play the character of Roslyn. The nuances she manages to express are beyond comparison.Jean Paul Sartre said that in The Misfits Marilyn not only justifies her position as a female heroine but also becomes a kind of a definition of humanity in general.I can't argue with that.

Those animals did nothing but what they were doing naturally-living free in the wilds.  The drive to capture the wild mustangs and the rodeo scenes were particularly cruel.  It would be fair to say that the early 60's were not the most ideal time to do a film with animal rights overtones, but The Misfits succeeds, with its subtle treatment of this issue, which would later in the 60's, culminate into a worldwide roar for rights on many different platforms. History continues to be a righteous teacher, as the real misfits in the film turn out to be the very people which championed mass slaughter and confinement of animals to turn a quick profit. Kudos to the cast and crew of The Misfits for making a timely statement with beautiful western scenery added.  Certainly a cinematic coup and curtain call for Gable and Monroe.

The superb cast were well versed in these matters, as their performances show with striking clarity, with Gables tragic loss of  wife Carole Lombard during the war, Clifts horrific car-crash a few years earlier, and Monroes ongoing breakup with Miller paired with her own personal demons. Ritter and Wallach are equally great at displaying their vulnerability and ( in Wallachs case at least ) jealousy - although this film belongs in many ways wholly to Gable and Monroe, with some great scene-stealing from Clift whenever he is in the shot. There is not much to say about the plot, except its handling of a bygone era which remains in the hearts of those who knows no other way, and the consequences it has on the onlooker - and that the tale allows more depth into its simple frame than could be expected. This film may not be for everyone, as Hustons intentions clearly were to make a haunting piece of work, with no holds barred, and with no excuses concerning the characters follies, longings, or shortcomings.

Eli Wallach's Guido to Marilyn Monroe's Roslyn Taber - Here's to your life Roslyn. I hope it goes on forever. Along with Clark Gable's impassioned but desperate justification to Roslyn about the mustang roundup - Nothing can live unless something dies. It's just too easy to extract the symbolism from this film as it relates to the passing of it's principal stars so soon after it's release. I doubt if the actors were ever thinking in terms of the 'big picture' while making this underrated gem, but in hindsight the movie closes out the careers of some major Hollywood stars on a wistful note, made all the more poignant by the trajectory of their careers and the way they died.All the while I kept getting distracted by the young Eli Wallach's uncanny resemblance to Joe Pesci, and while trying to shake that, I managed conjuring up a mental picture of George Clooney twenty years from now and came up with Clark Gable's Gay Langland. Of course, there's only one Marilyn Monroe, and if you weren't thinking it, Gable's character manages to chime in to remind us that 'She's real prime.There have been many films about the passing of the Old West, but none that have come so close to the modern era to state it's message. Gay Langland knows it and desperately tries to hang on; Isabelle Steers (Thelma Ritter) recognizes it when she says I can smell the look on your face, Cowboy. A drifter refusing to 'work for wages', Langland lives his life a day at a time, and makes his point with Roslyn when she asks him where he lives. Right here is his reply, anywhere and nowhere, and oddly, one is as good as the other.I wonder if Gable felt out of place among these young actors. Monty, Monroe and Wallach all came up in the 'method' tradition, and when Gable tries that approach, it has almost a humorous outcome. I'm referring to the scene when he literally cracks when he finds that his kids have abandoned him at the hotel, climbing up on a car and falling off for dramatic effect, yelling at the top of his lungs. 'Were they even there?' was my thought. Was he so overwrought wishing they had showed up that he made himself believe it? I don't know enough about Arthur Miller's script to know the answer and have only now seen the film for the first time, but it's an interesting exercise to think through.For the male leads, there's no doubt that they all turned in exceptional performances here. For those who have the 'Some Like it Hot' image of Marilyn Monroe, this is the picture to convince you that maybe she had some talent after all. She has you believing her character, using her eyes at least as expressively as her more alluring assets. You can feel all her pain, as an actress and as a person when she looks waywardly to the sky before the mustang roundup, and all she can do is cry 'Help.

Knowing that going in and if you don't mind downbeat films there are some really moving performances from a cast full of legends.Heavy with gloom there is still much too admire though Miller's prose is at times heavy and tending towards pretension. Marilyn's woozy sexuality coming through a haze of pills and booze at times still suits her character's searching and displaced loneliness. Clark Gable accepted his part after first choice Robert Mitchum passed. Mitchum would have been great of course and publicly stated he regretted not taking the role since he and Marilyn were longtime friends, before both were famous he had worked with her first husband, and he felt that around him she would have been able to pull herself together as she had on River of No Return. This was the end of the line for Gable and his weathered appearance and weariness actually suits the role better than Mitchum's ruggedness would have at that point. The film contains some of the best acting Clark ever did.Clift and his sad broken looks make a powerful impact and Wallach scores well too but the great Thelma Ritter is somewhat shortchanged since she disappears about halfway through the picture. Her astringent tartness would have been most welcome later in the film when the real heavy going takes place.

One involves all the men getting drunk and piling into a car with Marilyn Monroe. Gable and Clift fall asleep in the back seat, leaving the besotted Wallach to drive them home at 90 miles an hour, rambling on about how many people, horses, and dishes he destroyed while bombing nine European cities during the war, while a frantic Monroe sympathizes with him and begs him to slow down.They arrive at Gable's and Wallach's dilapidated rural homestead. The trip from Reno, Nevada, has taken some time. Now, in an ordinary movie, the men would be sober and grumpy as they wake up and tumble out of the station wagon. Instead, Huston has them still drunk. It's a hilarious and very masculine moment as Clift staggers around tearing the bandages from his half-shattered skull, demanding to know what they are, challenging the others and shouting, You put me at a DISADVANTAGE? He's stumbling over boards and falling down and Gable is growling with laughter and throwing mock punches at him from ten feet away. I imagine the writer, Arthur Miller, to whose wife, Marilyn, this is a paean, wrote the scene but Huston really put it together. Miller gives her some good lines though. In the blazing stillness of the desert, Marilyn remarks, It's so quiet out here. You can hear your clothes against your skin.Another memorable scene has Marilyn in a polka-dot dress whanging away at a paddle ball in a Reno saloon while all those part of her that must shake during such an exercise jiggle away.The most powerful scene, and it's rather long, appears at the end. The boys have taken Marilyn out to the desert to watch them rope wild mustangs that will be sold to the canneries for dog and cat food. The first time I saw this, in a theater, I was impressed, but this time around I found it a bit more than just a dramatic action scene.Instead of the hundreds of ponies that used to roam the highlands, the band is now only able to round up half a dozen, including a mare and her year-old foal, and the stallion who runs the remuda. Shocked and repelled, the nurturant Marilyn runs away and disembowels the men in long shot. Gable fights the stallion to a point of mutual exhaustion and then releases the creature and his small brood.You can't rope a dream. The mustangs represented his only real opportunity of avoiding wage work and having to take orders from someone else. For Gable, the problem isn't horses. It's history passing him by, and it's age too. The ground has shifted under his feet. Clift has already accepted this, though he has his own demons to contend with. Wallach is not yet ready to give up and screams insults at the others as they drive off and leave him behind.Gable's fate is to settle down and do wage work while living with and eventually marrying Marilyn Monroe. Now, that's my kind of surrender.I doubt that the film would be as good as it is without Huston's having directed it. (As it is, there are some talky moments and author Miller has made some things too explicit and some exchanges too wordy.) But, just for example, who else would have staged that climactic scene in which Monroe excoriates the men for their brutality so that she is seen about fifty yards away and can barely be heard? It's not really a tragic tale. There's a good deal of comedy in it, the characters are user friendly, and, to tell the truth, all that cowboy masculinity, hairy and angular, needed a touch of tender-minded femininity. Gable proves adaptable and if he doesn't lead the ideal life he'd always intended -- well, who does? And Wallach, who refuses to change, will grow old and bitter.

You get this film. The last film of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe.It is difficult to describe this film. It is definitely worth watching, but explaining what it is to someone that has not seen it is almost impossible. Like previous films I have reviewed that were intimate character studies Night of the Iguana and L'avventura, there really is no 'arch' in this film. There is no beginning, middle and conclusion.These are troubled individuals before the advent of counseling and therapy. Lord knows, each of them would be on a psychiatrists couch for decades. But in the early 1960s, the wide open spaces of Nevada is the couch and the characters must counsel each other.It is no secret that Arthur Miller penned this screenplay for this wife, Marylin Monroe. The acting in the film is excellent. I mean really good. Marilyn Monroe was no bimbo. She knew how to act and her character borders between virginal, ditzy and very intense. Clift and Gable are exceptional as the aging cowboys trying to make a living without resorting to 'wages'. The young Eli Wallach is intense and cocky as the recently widowed ex-army pilot on the rebound.All the men are vying for the affections of Monroe's character. She stumbles into their midst and breaths a breath of fresh air into their meandering lives, like smelling salts to a drowsy patient. But she has her demons as well and together they must all sort things out, but it isn't an easy road. In the end, some of the cast 'get it' and move on, but their fate is left up to the viewer.Time changes our views of some films. I saw this film a long time ago when I was younger. Back then, I went into a film expecting to see certain things, and my opinion of the film was based on what I hoped to see. Now, I go into a viewing trying to figure out what the director was trying to tell me and looking for the subtle things that youth don't tend to look for. In that regard, this film is a treasure trove of content with metaphor and symbolism in almost every scene. The last of which is Monroe's final line on screen, How do you find your way home in the dark? You will have to see this film to figure that one out.

If nothing else, that makes The Misfits a curiosity worth investigating.The screenplay is by famed playwright Arthur Miller, so it is unsurprisingly somewhat theatrical, and I can imagine much of the action taking place on a theatre stage. Famed director John Huston adds the cinematic touches, though, to make this very much a visual film.Miller was also married to Monroe, divorcing during the making of the film, and this is where the uncomfortable parallels begin, because Monroe's character Roslyn is herself a divorcée. However, as odd as it is, this must also be considered quite ahead of its time divorce was much less common in those days, and fault still considered a key pillar in proceedings.Roslyn is shown to be divorced for a reason though. The Misfits revolves around three damaged personalities, in what is an unremittingly bleak work. Montgomery Clift (who also died young) is a thrill-seeking rodeo rider who is so tragically doomed that the repeated foreshadowing of his demise is almost funny. Gable is an old-fashioned cowboy, ill-at-ease with a world which is changing around him and rendering him obsolete. Again, fiction mirrors life here, for Gable's heyday was 20 years previously. However, whereas his character Gay (it stops being funny before too long) refuses to adapt, it seemed to me that Gable was making too much effort to retain his physique into his late 50s, probably contributing to the massive heart attack which ended his life not long after filming.The film itself shows some signs of its age. Attitudes towards drink and women are uncomfortably dated, and some of the treatment of animals required to film the climactic horse wrangling scenes would never be allowed today. On the other hand, some of the shots of Monroe, clearly intended to be very risqué, seem ridiculously tame to the modern eye.The main theme is one of disillusionment, an unwillingness to adapt to a changing world. It's uneasy watching, especially as it asks whether we are the same. Miller's deft handling of the pace and rising sense of doom is a testament to his genius as a playwright, as are the numerous great lines that pepper the dialogue. Monroe has an odd approach to the acting, but this contributes to a performance as strong as anyone's in a cast of very strong performances. Her manic breakdown at the very end, filmed in a long shot against the backdrop of barren desert, is grimly fascinating viewing.Despite the presence of two screen icons and a directing legend though, the one person who comes out of this excellent production with the most credit is Miller.

But to say The Misfits is a great film would be misleading. It seems like an American attempt to be French, except the French can pull it off and Americans can't somehow, or at least couldn't in this case. Arthur Miller's preachy dialog and monologues are just hitting you over the head. The allegories, parallels, metaphors, symbols... are all too obvious, to the point of being annoying and making you roll your eyes. Monroe's acting is mediocre, though she is fascinating to watch. Wallach and Clift do a good job in general. Thelma Ritter, I would be brave enough to say, is the best actor in the film! Gable is just a caricature of a cowboy (and himself). Clift's and Monroe's ongoing substance abuse issues show through, which probably helps their acting, since they are supposed to be drunk throughout most of the film. The drastic character changes, especially for Gable's character, seem extremely forced. And of course, this being Hollywood and not a good French film, there is a happy ending! What?!?! No way should this film have a happy ending! But it does, go figure...Perhaps the most captivating scenes are when the men and Monroe go out mustanging (catching wild horses). These scenes with the horses, the struggle between man and nature, the struggle to make a living vs. being kind at the face of losing manliness and income... They are impressive and memorable. The film in the second half seems like an advertisement for PETA, Monroe being extremely upset at the men who are capturing the wild horses.I'd say watch it, if you must cover the important oldies or if you are a die hard fan of Monroe, Clift, Gable et al. But otherwise, those are 2 hours of your life you'll never get back...

She died of an overdose, which is often viewed as suspicious. That was 50 years ago, and her complexity as a woman, and her image endures without any abate. It is the fact that she was such a complex and damaged person that her screen icon status still adorns the walls of many people, and her perplexed beauty still has the power to beguile en-masse. The Misfits was her last completed film, - she never completed the filming of George Cukor's remake of My Favourite Wife (1940), Something's Got to Give, which has been subsequently released as a short - and I feel that it captures much of what made Norma Jean Mortensen, Marilyn Monroe.She plays Roslyn, a newly divorced woman, who meets up with a couple of older men, Guido (Eli Wallach) and Gay (Clark Gable - this was also his last film), and escapes with them to a country house. The men are besotted with this naive, sexy blonde who seem's to have a certain verve for life. They meet with Montgomery Clift's rodeo rider, Perce, as they venture out to the desert first for rodeo, then to catch some Mustang's (horses, not the car). When Roslyn discovers that the men plan to sell the horses for dog meat, her attitude towards the men, and their dying practises changes.Set in Nevada, the film engenders the idea that the cowboy, the working man, is something of the past. Modernity is taking over the landscapes of America, and this ethereal blonde figure enters the three men's lives to emasculate them from the barbaric ways of the past. But she is not there only for the purpose of altering the outlook of these gruff men, or to push modernity into the plains. Like the real Marilyn, Roslyn craves the attention of men, - Norma Jean never knew who her real father was, and her mother was less than interested in her - and especially is needy for a father figure; a man she can fully trust and rely on.This collusion of Marilyn's real-life and the character in The Misfits is no accident of course. The screenplay was written specifically for her by her then husband, playwright Arthur Miller, and he clearly knew her need for that elusive father figure, and her need to soak up attention, and wear her body (and image) as a mask to her internal pain, and tragic sense of abandonment.Whilst certainly not her best film (director John Huston had stated that she was difficult, and the decision to shoot in black and white was due to her bloodshot eyes - caused by alcohol and prescription drugs), that surely would go to Some Like it Hot (1959), but this is absolutely her greatest, and most revealing role. The Misfits also tells of the damaging effects of modernisation, and the nostalgia of the past.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"A moody, introspective drama","Date":"14 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":" This story chronicles the lives of three men and a divorcée in the Nevada mountains. Clark Gable, in his final film, is a wandering, over-the-hill, middle-aged cowboy who corrals wild mustangs for slaughter with Eli Wallach, his buddy and an aviator whose plane locates and traps the horses for Gable's unerring lariats. Marilyn Monroe, always fetching, has rid herself of her husband and has come west to find meaning for her life. Montogomery Clift is a washed-up bronc and bull rider, and the four major characters come together, with each one beset by emotional traumas from their pasts. A major theme throughout the film is regret about disappointments, missed opportunities, failed family and personal relationships. The unhappy, wistful thread of the movie is mirrored by the stark black and white photography and the distant mountain vistas. The beauteous Monroe is coveted by the three men but seems partial to Gable, perhaps of his detached persona and laid-back approach to life. Wallach makes no secret of his obsession with Monroe and spares nothing in his attempt to win her for himself. Clift, along for the ride because of Gable's taunts about the disgrace of earning wages, brings his usual brooding quality to the film and seems disillusioned because he has no psychological anchor in his life. Thelma Ritter, always excellent in supporting roles, appears with Monroe early in the story but disappears midway through and is not seen again. Gable's stunt work with the wild horses is thrilling and is the film's highlight but may have cost him dearly with the wear and tear he took doing these scenes. The film is a fine coda to the careers of two of Hollywood's most storied personalities.

Directed by John Huston and photographed by Russ Metty, this film is classic movie and every time I see it I find it more and more involving. Movie fans will note John Huston directed MM in her first classic role in MGM's The Asphalt Jungle and this MM's last completed film.Arthur Miller wrote the screen play for his wife Marilyn Monroe. On the run up to the filming Ms. Monroe scored the greatest hit of her fabled career in Billy Wilder's comedy masterpiece Some Like It Hot giving a performance deserving of an Oscar. That film was also a United Artists film and MM had to make one movie at 20th Century Fox- her home studio- before 20th would allow Ms. Monroe to do another outside film again at UA The Misfits. The 20th film was George Cukor's Lets Make Love and co starred French idol Yves Montand. During the filming Marilyn Monroe fell in love with Montand and hoped to divorce Miller and marry Montand. For Yves Montand the affair was simply a fling. Devastated Ms. Monroe segued with only a few days vacation from George Cukor and Lets Make Love to filming The Misfits in the hot Nevada desert with John Huston. Two very different men and two different directorial style's. Marilyn Monroe's agony and sadness is apparent in this beautifully crafted film of losers in the Nevada desert circa 1960. Marilyn's unhappiness continued as Mr. Gable died after the filming and the media blamed Marilyn Monroe and her lateness and illnesses as a root cause of Clark Gable's stress. When The Misfits opened Marilyn Monroe escorted by the equally troubled co star Montgomery Clift gave the film a razzle dazzle opening as only MM could but the critics at the time did not get this film. In the rear view mirror of cinema History, one can see John Huston and company made a brilliant film, one that never disappoints and again reinforces the brilliance that Marilyn Monroe uniquely brought to the screen. I highly recommend this superb drama that brought together two classic superstars Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, the King and Queen of the movies. Ironically as MM was a contract star to 20th Century Fox in my opinion MM's two greatest performances were in UA films Some Like It Hot Billy Wilder's smash hit comedy and this stark drama directed by John Huston. The ending of The Misfits is one of the best ever! Memorable!Marilyn Monroe in her short but fabled career worked with Clark Gable, John Huston, Jack Lemmon, Billy Wilder, Joseph Mankiewiez, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers, Robert Mitchum Howard Hawks, George Cukor, Laurence Olivier, Bette Grable, Tony Curtis, Lauren Bacall, et al.

And, in many ways, reflects most vividly what made her so distinct.Younger people sometimes ask about the nature of her appeal, what was so superlative about her?, was she overrated?, was she just another it girl for her day?, etc...In addition to being genuinely very pretty (most Hollywood beauties really are not) with an absolutely perfect feminine body (despite the occasional weight bump) Marilyn really did perfect the tormented, seemingly helpless blonde sex kitten persona better than anyone else, before or since, blending both the nice girl and bad girl archetypes of the mid-twentieth century.Also, she's one of the only ones who left behind a filmography of genuinely good pictures.But the era is also key to her appeal; they're inseparable... The idealized, picture perfect self-image America had during the sleepily optimistic new consumerism of the post-war, primary color-saturated 1950's when her career occurred, and the haunted end-of-an-world mood at the peak of the Cold War during the JFK years in the early-'60s when she died, mysteriously, in that cozy little bungalow in Brentwood.You either get that gauzy, wistful atmosphere or you don't. But it was immediately apparent even then, and it has everything to do with why Marilyn wasn't just one of the screen's greatest sex symbols (arguably, THE greatest) but an ideal icon and metaphor for a promising yet fascinatingly tragic period of American history that still intrigues and confounds.She just fits it perfectly.

It sure takes time to criss-cross the various characters who talk at length about what's bugging them and what they want from life, and then the same sort of scene takes place again but in different surroundings. It's a vicious merry-go-round of a sad state of affairs.Not even the wonderful THELMA RITTER can inject any of her usual levity into the gloomy proceedings with an occasional wisecrack. MARILYN MONROE looks wistfully at Gable (and everyone else--almost as if she's been drugged), and this is supposed to show us how sensitive she is. To her credit, she does rise to the occasion in the dramatic finale where the men are rounding up horses and Monroe screams at them in horror when she realizes what's happening. Her near breakdown looks genuine and heartfelt...but what was her state of mind during the first part of the film? Hard to tell--she goes from happy to sad within each segment with little explanation given.CLARK GABLE's character is no more illuminating--he seems to be playing a lazy but good-natured drifter who doesn't really know where he's going or what he wants and he gets lifeless support from MONTGOMERY CLIFT who seems to be (like Monroe) in some sort of daze most of the time. Maybe he's supposed to be sensitive too. Subtle, no? As you can see, this will never rank as one of my favorite films even though the script is by the renowned Arthur Miller and the direction is by the equally renowned John Huston who had a hard time coaxing Marilyn Monroe onto the set.Pretentious from start to finish is the only verdict I can come up with and a difficult film to watch without losing patience.Unfortunately, its chief distinction today is that it was the last film of Gable and Monroe.

Watching The Misfits,  I constantly pitied Monroe and Clift, especially the lady, because I somehow realized that they were becoming as hopeless as their characters, maybe even worse. I remember thoroughly enjoying 1945s The Lost Weekend, where Ray Milland played a bibulous writer sinking into madness due to his addiction; what made Milland's performance award-worthy was his well calculated and researched act - he knew exactly how to create his character and draw it out throughout the film. Did we ever fell that Milland himself was an raging alcoholic? No, and that precisely why he was showered with bounteous praise. When we watch films, not including documentaries, we want to see actors immersing themselves into their characters, feeding, nurturing and developing them in the course of the movie. Documentaries, on the other hand, depict real lives and true emotions which make some hard to watch. The Misfits seems to swing between a film and a documentary, and we don't  get a stable film As a result. Clark Gable himself was glad when shooting completed - he was perhaps one of the few persons who wasn't at the edge of their lives. His death, however, is extremely ironic. The plot does not seem to do enough justice to its characters; what I could surmise was that Roslyn's divorce due to incompatibility and lack of understanding and care on the part of her husband leads to her character searching for a man who could defeat his virile ego and respect her altruistic ideology. But Roslyn seems too much of a basket case herself with Marilyn playing her- the soft focus doesn't help since it makes her all the most inaccessible. I wouldn't have married such a woman, despite her beauty and fulsome assets, because appears so disturbed. Guido is unnecessarily antagonized towards the end but more than that, I found the intense focus on capturing Mustangs slightly digressive. The angle did lead to several implications, however it remains unsatisfying. The film is one of Marilyn Monroe's lesser known ones, and the banality and dismalness can make the pacing tedious at times. However, there are well-acted moments and meaningful dialogs and some worthy content as well. If only the movie could let itself loose...My Rating 5.8 out of 10.

After a recent viewing on TCM, I'm thinking that it was about how three different men look at and are attracted to a beautiful woman, or perhaps even how Arthur Miller was seeing his wife at the time. Three men attracted to the same woman for three different reasons. For Clark Gable, the crusty old cowboy, this recently divorced woman played by Marilyn Monroe was seen as the child that he wanted to father after a wasted life in which he 'lost' his real children. For Montgomery Clift the Monroe character has become the mother who turned cold on her little boy, a boy unable to grow up, and the Clift character finds her sensitivity to him becoming the mother who has abandoned him. Eli Wallach on the other hand is entranced by the pure sexuality of the young divorcée, a sexuality that had been missing in his deceased wife and that he has lived without for all the years since her death. Could it be that the writer of the screenplay has been seeing his wife in all three ways? John Huston's direction and the photography are flawless, but not so with the Monroe character as it is written and how it is played. It's too much of a stretch for me to see a glamorous woman, who danced in nightclubs, attends to the details of making up her face, and dressing as sexily as she does would be a woman to dance in the field and hugs trees. I find the inconsistency too much to swallow. The other players are real and believable, but because of the way it was written, or a need to showcase the sex goddess the way viewer have been seeing her, it became for me the one major flaw in what I'd expect to be a great picture given the credentials of all involved, including the music of Alex North.

The protective armor of the characters is flayed, exposing their pain.Dancing to Peter North's riveting theme, the opening graphics show parts of a picture puzzle merging, not fitting and then separating, spinning off aimlessly.The film is so good as to be almost beyond belief, beginning with the Arthur Miller screenplay. John Huston managed the Herculean task of getting the best from the cast and finishing the film. Ubiquitous in the background, we have the feral beauty of the Nevada desert.The Mustang roundup The wild horses are a metaphor for the three men who capture them; they do to the horses what life does to them. Sensing this, busted-up bronc rider Perse Howland (Montgomery Clift) expresses his guilt to Roslyn, It don't seem so bad when there are more of them. A number of western dramas showcase the functional and emotional obsolescence of men as times and circumstances change faster than they can adapt. In MISFITS, all the men are broken and obsolesced. Roslyn Taber (Marilyn Monroe), still young and pretty, has a better than average chance of success. Being Everyman's wet dream doesn't hurt, either, if she'll take better care of herself in the future.DAMAGED GOODSMarilyn Monroe is better than expected, thanks to the tenacity of director John Huston. Roslyn Taber has a somewhat checkered past that she is reticent to discuss. Gay Langland (Clark Gable) loves her for what she is. However, she did not reciprocate when she saw how he rounded up the mustangs to be sold for dog food. She so fiercely defended the horses that the men gave up and let them go. To be sure, they never would have allowed a man to get away with that. In fact, Perse thought there would be one helluva fight.The Cowboys The aging divorcée Isabelle Steers (Thelma Ritter) says the only real men left are cowboys. As the song goes, They never stay home and they're always alone, even with someone they love. In THE MISFITS we have men who chafe at the strictures of society. 'Working for wages' is seen as loss of freedom. But they are tough and brave. When fate closes in on them, they take their lumps - as real men should. True, they prey on Reno's emotionally needy, confused divorcées, but they are not amoral, like Lester Diamond (James Woods), the manipulative, remorseless scofflaw in CASINO.The quest for the Holy Grail The Rodeo cowboy, Perse, named after Perecival, one of the knights of the round table, is seeking the unattainable through sacrificing his body to the Rodeo. It is clear that he won't last much longer. Staying drunk is his way of dealing with the hurt and pain in his life. The pilot Guido is the most interesting character in the film. He has lost the most because he had the most to lose. W.W. II took him away from medical studies and put him in the cockpit of a heavy bomber. His wife died because a flat tire prevented him from getting her to medical help in time, an excuse that Roslyn astutely recognizes as a weak cop-out that gave him permission to stop trying. He even offers to sell out his friends and spare the horses if Roslyn will leave Gay for him. Guido is the lost soul..Gay Langland realizes that their old way of life is gone. You can't lasso a dream, he says. To his credit, he accepts the inevitability of change instead of feeling sorry for himself. This shows hope and fortitude. Isabelle is right he is a real man.

Not often do things fill me up with the tremendous feeling of absolute perfection and happiness, but the way Manroe acted in this picture, was simply breathtaking. Note that this is a personal view on it, so don't go and get disappointed if you see it and don't like her, even though the chances are quite small. To the movie. It's a rather simple story but still interesting. (Note; I'm from Sweden and look at this Cowboy thing with other eyes than an American) It's a love story concerning envy between men, desire and most of all disagreements. The picture circles around Roslyn and Gay's love affair and Roslyn's love to all life, which doesn't mix that well with Gay's perspective on life. After all, he is a cowboy and make his living on rodeo and catching mustangs. Impeccable acting by Marilyn and Clark, very strong dialogues and a surprising deep make this movie worth watching.

What's interesting about this movie is the fact that it seems to tap so much into the personal lives of the actors, sometimes it's almost as if they aren't reciting dialog, they are actually living this material. Gable, like his cowboy character Gay Langland, was a somewhat washed-up star most people had forgotten about so he furiously attempted to make a comeback. Monroe was also on the downside of her career and most likely only got this part because her then-husband, playwright Arthur Miller, wrote the screenplay. Scenes between these two movie giants are interesting to watch, especially Monroe, who seems like she has completely immersed herself in this role and does some things you wouldn't expect of Marilyn Monroe.The supporting cast is also big-named with Montgomery Clift, Eli Wallach, and Thelma Ritter. Clift is okay here but he looks terrible considering he had been in a car crash years before and he was severely addicted to drugs. Clearly, the off-screen drama is more interesting than what is on-screen, but at times they seem interchangeable. The story is rather flimsy feeling like a play in the desert, and there really isn't too much in the way of excitement or entertainment. The true entertainment is in watching these immortal stars do scenes together and wonder about how great they all were. The acting is fine and the black and white cinematography is stark and captures the mood, but for the most part what you will remember is the names and how sad it is to see them having to end up like this.

I soon drove out to the flats where it was filmed and what a lonely, destitute piece of land that is. The film has brilliant writing. Arthur Miller taking snippets out of his relationship with MM. MM didn't stop him from exploiting personal issues. Script Lines like How do you find your way out of the dark or I suddenly miss my mother or Help (while she looks up to the sky) explode like a personal expose. She was apparently very angry with Miller after filming commenced when she saw the finished cut. The film is shot in beautiful black and white with a silver patina. All the actors are superb, with Thelma Ritter supplying some well needed comic relief. I'm not a big fan of Gable but he is outstanding in this role. The direction by John Huston is sometimes slow paced but it follows up to an exciting if not heartbreaking finish. He was clearly giving all the actors space to give their best performances. Years of substance abuse show clearly on MM's face. As sick as she was during the filming she gives a brave, honest, earthy performance as Roslyn. Highly Recommended viewing.

Monroe puts forth her most finely tuned acting performance, as does a closeted Montgomery Clift as the third wheel.

That so he'll be forgotten about and go on with his career, to bigger and better things,in the hope that no one would remember him being in the film! As for those in it, besides Gable & Monroe who never lived to do another movie, they somehow survived the curse of The Misfits and went on with their mostly successful film theater & TV careers. That with the possible exception of Montgomery Clift as the washed up rodeo star Pence Howland. Clift at age 45 died of a sudden heart attack at his East 61 street Manhattan townhouse five years later on July 23, 1966. That's when he found out that the movie The Misfits was going to be broadcast for the first time on network TV that very evening and the shock must have been too much for him to take!Guy Roslyn & Pence together with Roslyn's divorced friend Isabelle, Thalma Ritter, and part time pilot and full time mechanic Guido, Eli Wallack, are more or less throw aways from society who just don't seem to fit in with the modern world. Isabelle for her part disappears halfway through the movie as if she was kidnapped by a UFO in the Nevada desert or she realized just how bad the film is and decided to check out before she ended up destroying her career by being in it! As for Clift & Wallack, who were to make movies after The Misfits, they seemed to stay in the movie just to be near and around Marilyn Monroe who's presences made being in this below par,in the top cast that it had in it, film more then worth while, for a male, in their being in it.The movie itself has to do with Gay & Guido trying to capture a number of wild mustangs or wild horses and have them slaughtered by turning them into dog & cat food. That at a measly 6 cents a pound! Pence who was already suffering from severe brain damage, by being thrown and gored by a rodeo bull, just went along for the ride. It was the sweet and caring Roslyn who had no idea what the men, Gay Guido & Pence, were up to who ended up freaking out when she found out that the mustangs were to be slaughtered not sent to a zoo or petting farm to live out their lives in both safety and comfort!***SPOILERS*** It was Roslyn's hysterics and threatening to kill herself that changed Gay's mind in killing the mustangs after he and Pence captured them. It was only the money hungry Guido who wanted to go through with slaughtering the mustangs so he can get, at 6 cents a pound, his some $50.00 in blood money! Finally coming to his senses with his head cleared up, after almost getting killed in the rodeo ring, Pence set, with Roslyn's encouragement, the mustangs free to run both free & wild in the Nevada desert. Guy now realizing what a greedy and unfeeling jerk he was hops on his rinky dink pick-up truck with Roslyn by his side as he drives through the open desert to his battered down and deserted homestead to grow carrots and cabbage and for once live a normal happy and peaceful life.

Yet by the end of the decade, 4 stars of the film, Gable, Monroe, Montgomery Clift and Thelma Ritter were all gone.Ritter was as folksy here as ever. Nevada seemed to be the land for her and the rest of the cast to settle in as it represented that wandering lust for all. Dittor for Monty Clift, who, the idealist and at a same time, pragmatist, laments the sudden death of his father and how his life turned out when his mother remarried 3 months later. As always, surviving character, Eli Wallach presents an interesting person here. Giving up a medical career and watching the unexpected death of his pregnant wife, he still showed greed in wanting to pursue the horses.

It was both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe's last completed film. It was written especially for Monroe, by her last husband Arthur Miller, at the end of their marriage. It also starred Montgomery Clift, who was notoriously unstable following his car accident, and relatively unknown character actor Eli Wallach. Perhaps the only stable part was Thelma Ritter, a well-known, reliable character actor. Even the director, John Huston, was a wild card. The production seemed doomed.THE PLOT The Misfits opens in Reno, Nevada, where young divorcée Roslyn is staying, while waiting for her divorce to come through. She is with her friend, Isabelle, and they stop in a café. There, they meet Gay Langland, a cowboy who has seen better times. Roslyn decides, in the spur of the moment, to accompany Gay to his ranch, in the desert.To avoid giving away too much, I'll describe the rest of the plot in much broader strokes. They spend the rest of the film mainly in the desert, where we also meet Guido, a younger ranch hand, with an instant infatuation to Roslyn. The film also includes Pierce, a Rodeo man, who's gone way past his prime, but continues despite this.THE CRITICISM I'll begin with the actors. Marilyn Monroe was not a great actress, but she fit certain roles. This was not a 'typical' Monroe role, but she does well. I can't help but feel that her performance was desperate, and it works well at times, while failing at others. It is an average performance, but it certainly ranks among her greatest. However the main acting achievement on display here, was that of Clark Gable, in his last performance.Gable was always cast as a matinée idol, and he indeed has great looks and a wonderful screen personality. Unfortunately, he always played the same character, almost. Even Gone With the Wind dosen't fully break the mold. Here, from the start, it's something different. The charm and wit are still there, but buried underneath are layers of sadness. You get a sense that his time is passed, and he can't cope. The scene that shows this best, is when Gable, elated at seeing his kids, comes back to bring Roslyn to see them.They've already left, and he breaks down in drunken agony. It's his best performance. Also we have Thelma Ritter, bringing her usual amount of wit and pathos to the film. Eli Wallach is very slimy and completely one-minded in his obsession for Roslyn. Montgomery Clift is unstable and shaky, playing an unstable and shaky rodeo clown. It's his last great performance.Now to the writing. It is not Arthur Miller's best, he wrote it with the purpose to provide his wife with a good role. The plot is interesting however, and the film itself is well done, so this is not a major problem. The cinematography is equally as desolate, and captures the feeling of time lost, and a world that has moved on, and left you behind. Now, for my last criticism, I turn to the direction.Here, Huston tones it down slightly, and gives us a more subdued film, which is perfect for the subject. He was really a man who knew when to make his film experimental, and when to make it conventional. Here he goes the safe route, while still retaining the beauty of a film about loss. It works. In Huston's career, this may rank as a minor achievement, but the talent on display is undeniable. It is a beautiful film, that ends with one of the most moving moments in Huston's entire catalog. That's pretty much all I have to say.The Misfits, 1961, Starring Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift.

They're cowboys of sorts at their ranch (ignore the fact that they are around each other constantly and one of them is named Gay - it's just coincidence), and invite Roslyn out for a day. Soon all of them are falling head over heels for Roslyn.Apart from the top-notch cast, director John Huston and scriptwriter Arthur Miller, The Misfits really stands on its own as a character study - and a rather deep one, too. I read a few IMDb reviewers' comments that noted the story itself becomes rather muddled and unbelievable at times - I didn't really think so. I suppose the film does leave a few loose ends, but to be honest, I found this to be all the MORE realistic because this kind of stuff really happens to us all in one way or another - happy, completely finalised endings are rare in life.It can be a bit slow and plodding at times, but that also boils down to whether or not you are engaged by the characters themselves. Admittedly, certain aspects of the script are - perhaps - a bit alienating and we don't really like all the people in this movie - but then again, we didn't like Alex DeLarge, Travis Bickle, or other cinema antiheroes. And some of the people in The Misfits could certainly be described as antiheroes (particularly for the time era the film was made) - just look at its title! The acting is very impressive - I'm not a big fan of Monroe in general but even I thought she did fairly well here and it certainly come across as one of her less glorious roles. Clark Gable offers a different type of performance - kind of subdued and disassociated; he speaks about things such as extramarital affairs as if it's just common discussion, not showing any emotion.The rest of the cast ranges from good to great - I was a bit disappointed by Eli Wallach's performance and felt his character could have been expanded a bit, but it's a minor complaint.In the end, this will leave some viewers feeling alienated and cold - and understandably so. For those of us who can appreciate this rather than condemn it, you may find something of interest here; but it's certainly going to depend, ultimately, on how you approach the material itself.

There were the new, hip films with sharp photography, wobbly cameras and jazzy scores. And then there were the old style movies, epics, Westerns and musicals; the faded glory of the studio system. The Misfits is in the style of the new, but it is about the death of the old.The casting of Clark Gable here seems fairly apt. Gay Langland is essentially a hanger-on, trying to keep the traditional life going long after the old West is dead and buried. Gable was not really a hanger-on in that sense, but he was certainly part of an old Hollywood that was on the way out. What's more he was a type of old-style actor who didn't really fit in the new Hollywood. For this reason his casting may be apt but it is also slightly self-defeating. Gable was not a bad actor, but his manner is sweeping and melodramatic. He doesn't really seem to know what to do in this edgy little drama. His singsong vocal delivery seems out of place, and his drunk act is barely believable. But what is heartening about his performance is that he is clearly trying, and seems to believe in the picture. He also clearly still believes in his own seductive prowess, and why not? He may be a little craggy with age but he still has it. However director John Huston appears to be deliberately getting away from Gable's romantic image, giving him a rather innocuous entrance with his face away from the camera, and not treating him too favourably with the lighting. We see his suaveness from the outside, rather than being subjected too it. The result is not one of Gable's best turns, but he is a true Gay Langland figure.Gable's leading lady Marilyn Monroe was nowhere near as old or experienced, but she had reached a similar point to Gable in her shorter career trajectory. She still has her beauty, but you can see her weariness for the whole affair. Like Gable, she is not acting as well as she had in the past, with some rather trite mannerisms and a vocal delivery that is either panting or screeching, but she is right for the character. In her mid-50s heyday, Monroe was like a vivacious beacon, full of life. This is the way the men of the Misfits see her, although as Gable's character points out her happiness is a mask for her melancholy. It's really no surprise that Monroe's character fits her reality so well, as the part was written for her by husband Arthur Miller. While he marginalizes Gable, Huston makes Monroe the centre of attention.Monroe and Gable are supported by a handful of top-class players from the era. There's Eli Wallach, underrated in his day but just a little overrated now thanks to his almost cult status. He gives a reasonable performance here. Montgomery Clift (ironically given the title) fits in very well as another actor at an awkward point in his career, having only ever played handsome young men, but now having arrived at the brow of middle age. He certainly gives the best performance of the bunch, although as with Gable, Huston's camera does not favour him too much. The real treat is of course Thelma Ritter. Ritter was really an outstanding comic, making humour out of the earnestness she gives to her character's preoccupations, in particular the bizarre fondness she bears for her former husband. Oddly enough it is this frumpy, middle-aged woman who is the liveliest of them all.This was a time of change in cinema, and you can tell a lot about the contradictions in the industry at this point by looking at the trailers. The one for the Misfits absolutely misses the point, scraping the barrel for a handful of clips that suggest Gable = action and Monroe = sex. Those connotations would have already been in cinema-goers minds the moment they saw the two names on a poster, and it seems rather pathetic that the trailer should effectively lie to confirm their expectations. Is if that wasn't enough, the tagline 'SMASHING' thru the Excitement Barrier! could hardly be further from the mark. Old Hollywood was dying hard. Unsurprisingly, the Misfits did not do very well at the box office. Even today, it can be hard going, its sadness more depressing than poignant. It is a picture worth seeing, nicely made at the very least, but perhaps one to be appreciated more than enjoyed.

Furthermore, Hollywood had long been a happy beneficiary of what was essentially Broadway's refuse. Remember, the wise man once said, One man's trash is another's treasure. What wise man is that? Well just how are we supposed to know that, Schultz? SCREENWRITER, legitimate Theatre and highly regarded Playwright, Arthur Miller, had no doubt had this one on the drawing board (in his head, Schultz) for some time when he made the decision to bring it to the mass popular audience of the Movie House. At first thought, some of us may well think that this a less than dignified destination for an essentially Stage Oriented work; but, not so fast there folks! Many a play would have gone on to the unknown ashcan of total obscurity if it weren't for the Moguls who operated in such little kingdoms known by names such as Warner Brothers, 20th Century-Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, RKO and others of slightly less prominence. It is an unproduced play titled Everyone Goes To Rick's that is perhaps, the prime example; of course, we all know it as CASABLANCA (Warner Bros., 1942).NOT unlike THE PETRIFIED FOREST (Warners, 1936), writer Miller and Director John Huston take a small number of characters, as a sort of microcosm of modern society and places them in the dessert, a sort of metaphor for life in an uncertain and ever changing world. This film was an adaptation of a Broadway Play by Robert E. Sherwood. Incidentally and oddly enough, both the Stage Play and its Screen off spring both starred Leslie Howard and a still largely unappreciated Humphrey Bogart.* AUTHOR, Mr. Miller chooses to have his people meet quite by accident in a Bar & Grill; whereas Robert E. Sherwood's THE PETRIFIED FOREST makes use of a Gas Station. In both stories, unlikely members of society, much like Politics, makes for strange bedfellows.LAMENTATIONS about the changing world and how good it was in the Good Old Days make nostalgia a definite element of THE MISFITS. Cowboy Gay Langland (Mr. Clark Gable) is almost a pure symbol of the now vanished Old West. Langland's ways, occupation means of support and attitudes are all indicative that he is one big, complicated anachronism.** Guido (Eli Wallach) is a guilt-ridden ex-WWII Air Corps Bomber Pilot, who feels remorse about all of the unintended casualties that he inflicted in raids over enemy cities. Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift) is sort of a guy caught between generations and destined to carry on the largely outmoded traditions and way of life of the Cowboy. Roslyn Taber (Marilyn Monroe) was a symbol of innocence lost. Being a former Dance Hall Performer (and possibly a Prostitute?); Roslyn meets up with the crowd after a quickie divorce in Reno.IN choosing the title for the story, extra meaning and metaphor were in definite consideration. 'Misfit' not only is a reference to the main characters; but also is a term for the wild, stray and dwindling numbers of Mustang horses, which the guys herded up and sold to dealers for slaughter and processing into horse-meat.THERE is one peculiar oddity which we noticed in the film. In the bar scene at the sight of the Rodeo, the old Cowboy at the bar with his grandson (James Barton) seemed to be playing his character as an homage to a fellow actor; who had since passed away. Now you can call me crazy and out of my head, but it sure seemed that he was doing a mighty fine impression of the late Walter Huston, father of Director John Huston. Just to be sure, we went to the old record book and discovered that Walter Huston's years of life spanned 1884 to 1050; which means he died about 10 or so years before the film's production and release. Please, check this out and see if there's anything to this assertion.AND lest we forget to mention, this was the screen swan song for Clark Gable; for he died before its release.SO too it was Miss Marilyn Monroe's penultimate movie appearance; as she was snuffed out by some one the following year. But that's another story. Marilyn was also married to Arthur Miller at this time and were divorced shortly thereafter. There's no evidence that Arthur had written this with Marilyn in mind, though.MEATY and filled with plenty of thought provocation, THE MISFITS was filmed in glorious Black & White and rates right up there with the best of any era.NOTE * When Warner Brothers Pictures acquired the rights to adapt THE PETRIFIED FOREST to the silver screen, they insisted on having Leslie Howard reprise his role as Alan Squier; but planned on casting heir own Edward G. Robinson as Duke Mantee (Bogey's role on Broadway). However, Mr. Leslie Howard had other plans. He held out for his friend and Stage Co-star, Humphrey Bogart. Now, that's loyalty.NOTE ** There's a certain similarity of Gable's Cowboy to Kirk Douglass' character in LONELY ARE THE BRAVE (Joel Company/Universal Pictures, 1962). Manyof the same 'modern' issues are addressed in both films.POODLE SCHNITZ!!

His comment Normally when one thinks of 'ill-fated crews' the S. S. Minnow comes to mind. . .And so it is with The Misfits.Even without knowing the difficulties involved in bringing the film to the screen; even without any awareness of the tragic fates of three of its stars, (Gable, Monroe and Montgomery Clift), one can still view The Misfits on its own terms and come away richer for the experience.There are those who say of The Misfits that nothing happens in it, as if that omission is a fault. Early on in the movie, Marilyn Monroe's Roslyn tells Gay, played by Clark Gable in arguably his best performance, that she doesn't know what to do next with her life. He tells her, sometimes when you feel that way, the best thing to do is just to stand still. Gay realizes that Roslyn's quickie divorce has left her at a crossroads, and that she is unwilling or unable to make any choices for herself. He obligingly steps in to make most of her decisions for her, including that implied in the famous fade-out, after a shattering confrontation which threatens to tear new-found friends and lovers apart.The movie depicts people who are all standing still, having closed chapters in their lives that have left them bitter, dissatisfied, unfulfilled or even cheated. The next phases of their lives are unfolding, and it is with trepidation, uncertainty and fear of repeating past mistakes that they all look anxiously ahead. Only Thelma Ritter's Isobel seems content with the hand fate has dealt her; she calls Nevada the leave it state, where people leave their spouses, leave their money in casinos and leave their nuclear waste in the desert. And she leaves her pragmatism, common sense and homespun wisdom wherever she goes.Most people's lives are marked by long stretches where nothing happens, yet how many of us describe our lives as gray, empty and consistently devoid of meaning? It's the moment at which Miller's characters are caught -- between unhappy pasts and uncertain futures, where nothing seems to be happening but anything might in the immediate future -- that brings forth beautifully wrought tension and drama from lives seemingly free of either.Extraordinary work both before and behind the cameras and a timeless story make The Misfits look better with multiple viewings and the passage of time. I don't believe 1961 audiences were quite prepared for the experience. It's more a character study than a neat, linear narrative, and there is no titanic struggle between good and evil; all the characters fit somewhere in between. They may be misfits in society, but not with each other.Two other notes although I have not looked this up, I feel certain that Thelma Ritter's broken arm was written into the script.Notice that Montgomery Clift is not wearing gloves in the mustang roping sequences. He forgot to put them on, and the resulting rope burns tore his palms to shreds. But rather than have Huston and cinematographer Russell Metty re-shoot the scenes, he left the gloves off for continuity's sake. Ouch. "},{"Title":"Awesome","Date":"30 October 2006","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":" The Misfits is a character study about people who are unable or stubbornly unwilling to adapt to the world; or to the changing world. The title characters have all been seriously hurt in the process of living and are searching (consciously and unconsciously) for ways to cope with what has happened to them in the past. To the extent that they represent an almost universal condition, the film is an allegorical study, with each character meant to illustrate a different means of coping with the realization of ones growing irrelevancy. The film, perhaps more perfect because of its flaws, should remind viewers of Unforgiven, Ride the High Country, and Cutter's Way. Arthur Miller's script is a good one, but it is John Huston's direction that transforms good into great. In part from his inspired casting and in part from his ability to draw career best serious performances from his four stars. The initial setting is Reno, symbolically appropriate because as the quickie divorce capital, it is a place where people try to scrap off the excess baggage of their pasts. Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe) has come there for this purpose and her new freedom is a beacon to her three male co-stars. Her beauty and childlike innocence is a catalyst for the three because she tangibly represents a future that all feel will slip away from them without her. All three of the men are essentially dead, a condition that Roslyn finally grasps toward the end of the film. The Roslyn character never entirely comes into focus, and Monroe is actually shot in soft-focus; intentionally contrasting with the sharp focus of the others.There is not a great deal of conflict between the characters, mostly they are fighting their own internal battles.A mechanic, Guido (Eli Wallach), wants to possess her as a way to rekindle his dream of domestic bliss, which was destroyed when his wife died. A WWII pilot who flies an old biplane, Guido still owes a half-finished house in the country; its construction (and the forward progress of his life) stopped with the death of his wife. Guido copes by living in the distant past (symbolized by his ancient tattered biplane), complaining about the unjust recent past, and scheming (not dreaming) about the future. Late in the film Wallach's character undergoes an abrupt and inconsistent transition. This is the film's one major flaw and may have resulted from Monroe's fear that Wallach's character as originally scripted would over shadow hers.Perce (Montgomery Clift) is a relatively young rodeo rider who has been kicked in the head a few too many times. His idyllic childhood was shattered by the death of his father and his mother's remarriage. Deprived of his destiny by these events, he copes by dulling his senses with bruises, concussions, and alcohol. He is too sensitive when clear-headed to deal with reality of the outside world. Gay (Clark Gable) is an old-time cowboy who is estranged from his wife and family. Unable to control that situation he is determined to retain control of himself, vowing to remain independent and not work for wages. He wants to possess and control Roslyn as well.Eventually the four characters set out on a venture to round up wild Mustangs and sell them to a dog food manufacturer. Out on the isolated range the four characters face their own demons and each other. Mustanging (essentially misfit humans rounding up misfit horses) was once a romantic adventure, but what seemed OK when the wild horses were numerous seems cruel and pathetic given their diminished number. And it is clearly not a self-sustaining venture as even Guy realizes that the depleted herds offer no future to the cowhand wishing to remain independent.The climatic scene has Guy struggling to subdue a wild stallion, which symbolically represents the world that has changed out from under him. He knows that he must change to have a future, but stubbornly refuses the efforts of anyone to dictate that change. He will change, but it will be on his own terms. By the end, he and Roslyn learn to respect each other, a respect that has everything to do with freedom and nothing to do with possession. Monroe gives her finest serious performance. Determined to make it as a serious actress, she had by this time devoted considerable time to the study of acting. Huston taps into a method performance which is effective because she is able to let her own vulnerability shine through. Much like Elizabeth Hartman's stuff, you are not sure how much of the tortured character is acting and how much is coming from inside the actress. Whatever it is, it is very effective.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

I finally got Miller's 50s tinged message. I was able to see for the first time what the fuss about Gable was all about. He listens to other actors in their scenes, reacts plausibly, has an interesting, expressive face, and certainly possesses a certain magnetism. The other actors do equally well, though I gather, in spite of Huston, who gave little direction to actors. Monroe looks gorgeous here, at the beginning of middle age, and does indeed glow on the screen.The problem is that this picture is too long and doesn't really come together. And I think the main problem is Miller's writing. From my own experience acting in his plays, he could create interesting, deep characterizations and knew how to write good lines. But his dialogue is just not the way people talk to each other, not even in 1960, and his sense of plot was always a bit manipulated.As a result the picture crawls along, with no sense of one situation growing out of the previous one, just a few set scenes strung together. It's only in the final scene that the writing, and the picture, reach for some kind of poetry and beauty.

They take her and her landlady out into the country, where they work with horses. As the men, and their friend Perce begin to fall for Roslyn, the real nature of their characters, the stuff that shows with time, begins to come out.With an all star cast, a director with classics under his belt and a script from Arthur Miller, the credits of this film made me believe I had made the right decision in taping it. I had not even heard of it more than the title when I watched it and I had gotten the impression that it was some sort of star vehicle traditional western &#150; I could not have been more wrong. Instead I took this to be a mix of end of era western, mixed with allegory about relationship and the nature of people. As such it threw up moments of interest and things that will stick in my mind for quite some time but Miller's screenplay is rather downbeat and, to be honest, not a great deal happens at times &#150; making it hard to stick with.It is still interesting of course but as a filmed stage play (which is how it seemed) it doesn't ever seem to come together. I never really got to the heart of the matter (or the characters) and I felt like I had been left with a collection of discussion points for the future but no real impression made by the film. Huston does a really good job with this scenery and the film is beautiful to look at filmed, as it is, in a black and white so stark that it easily matches the material. He also draws good performances from his cast, which is a bigger feat than it sounds as I personally didn't feel they were given more than one or two aspects of character to work with &#150; certainly I didn't seem them as people so much as performances.Despite this the cast are roundly good and time has added this film even more of a sombre tone in that it was the last films of Gable and the penultimate one from Monroe, with Clift only a few years behind. Gable is good and it is, as another reviewer has commented, a brave performance from him &#150; swinging wildly all over the place. Monroe also gives a very good performance but she has the thinnest of characters and it shows at times. However, despite me not liking her that much, I must confess I was impressed by her performance here. Wallach is good but is clearly lower on the food chain than these two as he has a less showier role &#150; but one that he delivers well. Likewise the always-wonderful Ritter delivers the same character she has in so many films and is an enjoyable addition, even if the film just seems to forget her after a while. Rounding out the all-star cast is a rather subdued Clift who I didn't think was any good at all and I finished the film with barely an impression of him. Generally though the performances were good when you consider that they were not presented with material that helped them aside from giving them stuff to show off with.Overall I was a little disappointed with this film but, like contestants on so many game shows, I didn't go home empty handed. I finished the film having enjoyed the horse scene (despite the very heavy meaning in it) and having several memorable scenes in my head. The script is low key but interesting even if it is way too slow at points. The performances are mostly good and add to the feeling that this is a filmed stage play (albeit a beautifully filmed stage play) but I just felt that the film can't manage to come together in a convincing way.

I wondered why - after I shut it off - and the first thing that struck me was how warped Arthur Miller's perception of people was. He makes the people of the Great Basin look like losers, alcoholics, and lechers. We used to make fun of the people of Nevada - called them Goat-ropers - thought them real rubes compared to us sophisticates from the Bay Area. But we never saw them as depraved as Miller depicts them. I get the impression Miller basically did not like people. I suspect that Miller was projecting his own depravity onto his subject. (Really his object. Miller was a hack in the Culture Industry. His world a dead realm of shapes and words.) I'll bet the reason MM killed herself was because Miller made her feel like chopped liver on a Ritz cracker. Miller's movie (and John Huston's movie - Huston also made some reprehensible films for anyone with a heart, like the one about the wacko-evangelical who rips his eyes out at the end - I forget the title) affects me the way Pier Pasolini's Salo does, it makes me want to damn them for having gratuitously diminished humanity for the sake of screen effect. Watch this movie, if you must, but it is far from an essential film if you want to master the canon. It is, in the final analysis, paralytically depressing. I say paralytically because it took me 40 years to finally recognize it for what it is. Watch something else.

Whether it comes from a far off corner of Europe is of less importance than the fact I want to counterpoise to AFI's customary list of 25 best (male) actors revised annually. In my opinion the top 10 (7) should look like this - Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, John Wayne, Cary Grant, James Stewart, etc. The first 4 died in their 60s which means grossly a contribution for early (classic) cinema of 30 years each. In that period before-after World War II the rest 3 lived longer but less actively, so for all of them stardom was achieved before 1950. After that date began a Golden Age for Hollywood with avalanche of new celebrities many of whom could displace the above mentioned merited men but would never be first. So modern cinema comes second and 21st century cinema comes third, I guess.This much for classification purposes. Now let me bargain a bit for Clark Gable's legacy. In our country in the best supplied video club I know there was available in DVD or Blu-ray only 1 movie with CG - Gone with the Wind (1939). Further titles could be obtained on the black market - mainly re-exported disks from Russia - and, maybe download something from Internet if you have got the hunch for it. This is deplorable situation for the coming young generation that straps its culture no further than the carousel they are toiling over all day long. That's all.How about my evaluation on omnibus Clark Gable. I am not the perfect judge but if only for Gone with the Wind he deserves the leadership of the above enumerated gang. Nobody before him achieved the feat of 4 hours movie at such an early date and even today Margaret Mitchell's novel awaits its remake. On the contrary, that doesn't mean automatically that Gary Cooper or Humphrey Bogart are not worth the leading place. It's a complex interplay of factors and opinions, while my choice is suited for the obscurantist observer who wouldn't compromise first for the physical outlook and then for the character of the participant. Things like that!Let me give in a nutshell what I remember of Gable's personality from some 30 movies that I own. On males - he seldom dies, always positive hero, good with fists and gun, remarkable with cards and gambling, three years served in the army and came back on the wide screen. He promoted the following young actors in their early efforts (I don't insist anyone to comply with this statement) - so, Francho Tone, Fred Astaire, Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier.On females. There is hardly anyone who understands cinema that should not be aware Clark Gable was the first big heart-breaker in Hollywood. My materials evidence the following row of female stars - Joan Crawford (dancing lady, unsuccessful mannequin); Jean Harlow (bra-less under the satin, died unexpectedly of nephritis infection); Norma Shearer (some should say ugly, but very man-handling); Myrna Loy (like Jean Harlow but alive); Claudette Colbert (dream of the city-slickers); Rosalind Russell (classical beauty wearing extravagant hats); Ava Gardner (a woman up to her sleeves); Debora Kerr (remained English not American, still ready for a bite); Marilyn Monroe (the last dish in the collection).

Mr. Gable emerges as Ms. Monroe's (and the film's) leading man; he leads the group on a hunting quest for flesh, explaining, Nothing can live unless something dies. Mr. Clift and Mr. Wallach agree with Gable. But, sensitive Monroe believes meat is murder. So, apparently, does Monroe's motherly landlady Thelma Ritter (as Isabelle Steers); however, she begs off the expedition early on, to join an ex-husband.The cast is extraordinary; and, adding director John Huston and writer Arthur Miller to the mix guarantees a very interesting motion picture experience. The Misfits falls short, but not by much. Despite the fact that Mr. Miller must have written the story with Monroe (then, his wife) in mind, the main character is played by Gable - that is, if you consider the fact that his character undergoes the greatest transformation, in reaction to Monroe's character. And, Gable, performs the part very nicely. More importantly, he displays a dramatic, modern acting prowess, which might have served him well through the 1960s.Of course, that potential went unrealized when Gable suddenly died. In part, his heart attack was attributed to Gable's work in The Misfits. This is one film where the personal lives of the cast, director, and writer adversely affects what you see on the screen. The most negative result is Monroe's characterization; she obviously needed more time with the role. Watch, for example, the scene with Monroe and Ritter, which plays after Gable walks off calling his dog (Tom Dooley). As the women turn a corner, Monroe has to steady herself. It's a slight, almost unnoticeable misstep; and, honestly, one which should have been re-shot.Probably, Monroe was so often indisposed, Mr. Huston had to do the best with what he had. It's a shame, because Monroe's acting is not at all inadequate. A particularly good moment to watch for is her truck ride, with Wallach; in this scene, Monroe is exceptional. Another good scene includes Monroe using her real voice, listen to her say, I don't care about the lettuce! At other times, Monroe appears very disconnected; often, she seems to be acting alongside, rather than with, her co-stars.Gable, Monroe, Clift, and Ritter are certainly convincing as heavy drinkers. Interestingly, Clift uses his personal demons to good acting advantage; whatever he was going through, privately, fit the character; and, he manages to essay the film's most consistently convincing performance. If The Misfits were more successful, Clift might have been nominated as a Best Supporting Actor for his role. Also award-worthy is Alex North's perfect musical score.The ending lines, uttered by Gable and Monroe, are quite touching... indeed, the stars are out tonight.******** The Misfits (2/1/61) John Huston ~ Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift, Thelma Ritter "},{"Title":"Watch it again","Date":"8 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":" This is art in the only sense that matters.Forget the Hollywood BS/gossipy trivia - this is a morality play.Watch it again , its worth it!This time watch for recurring themes like dark/light (clothing/backdrops)running reference to death - and the sources of life/light- for example, opens w/ dead battery scene - then the same character ( and the guiding angel Ms. Steers ) AGAIN lead her to life ; but she still is so willing to fill her empty desperation that she almost immediately needs to hear music - from the car radio - draining life from the battery....Guid says,  wife stood by me like a tree. ..MM's response is side-splitting !Anyway - look at it as a garden of Eden - and notice how the Paradise was spoiled by each character (spirit) by something that distracted or disappointed them on their journey - till each was a fallen angel -You gotta watch this in a pensive mode - with some love in your heart - it is delicious !

He admits that there's a lot of absorbing detail in it but it doesn't add up to a point.To my mind, it all boils down to a well-intentioned but weak original screenplay that, despite its powerhouse cast, direction and productional values, simply cannot overcome its inherent character/theme problems.At the same time, I note an increasing interest in and appreciation for this film by both public and critics.

Clark Gable (in his last role), especially, defines a realistic acting style that in his case creates a modern day cowboy who could make Hud look like a City Slickers reject.

Although she shares some very tender scenes with Clark Gable (and with wonderful Thelma Ritter as her landlady), Monroe's character is tough to get a grip on; she skitters through the picture like a tremulous breeze, fidgety about her feelings, desperate to be a mother-hen to this pack of misfits, though there's nothing concrete about this woman (she's like a mirage). The movie's best scenes are mostly at the beginning, before Montgomery Clift enters as a fragile rodeo rider and slows things way down. Screenwriter Arthur Miller provides pages of quotable dialogue, though he may have fashioned his slim, wayward plot around all the chatter. As a result, The Misfits is appropriately aimless and disillusioned, with a clever ear for how unshackled folks talk, yet it is extremely draggy. Director John Huston, who probably had some understanding of the material, captures several incredible sequences yet he doesn't seem certain of how to make an entertainment out of all this. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"An imperfect fit ...","Date":"19 July 2007","Score":"5 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Western","Review":" It is said that Marilyn Monroe had the ability to turn Marilyn on and off. Her friend Susan Strasberg said they once walked down a New York City street and no one paid a bit of attention to them, until Monroe turned Marilyn on and suddenly they were swarmed. On screen, Marilyn always seemed to be on; she had a certain plastic perfection, a theatrical quality which, even when it wasn't bordering on self-parody, was still nonetheless larger than life. Her odd mix of child-like innocence and provocative sexuality seemed strangely calculated; the on screen Marilyn always seemed to be giving a performance within a performance. Her not-so-dumb characters never seemed quite honest, they always seemed to be playing Marilyn. Yet, as artificial as her screen persona was, Marilyn was so unique that the disguise still seems strangely genuine. Marilyn Monroe was an invention, but it was such a wonderful invention that it became the reality. Her work in John Huston's THE MISFITS may be the only time on screen that we glimpse Marilyn Monroe as a real person, both as an individual and as a character, and not as an icon or a Hollywood contrivance. It is not Monroe's best performance -- that would be in BUS STOP -- but it is an affecting and sincere performance, yet somehow creepy, as we see clearly on screen the fragile, desperate woman we have been told existed off screen. Though only distracted now and then by the flickering presence of Marilyn, Monroe's character is that of a disturbed, vaguely depressed and self-destructive woman who is fated to attract others, yet remain alone and isolated. Deglamorized and allowed to be more or less human, rather than a creature of pure fantasy, Monroe shows more depth and humanity here than in most of her sex kitten roles. It was, alas, her last completed film; if nothing else THE MISFITS suggests what direction her career could have taken had she not died at the age of 36.As such, one wishes that THE MISFITS was just a better film. Written for Monroe by her then (and soon to be ex-) husband, playwright Arthur Miller, the film seems to be a bit too theatrical, a little too aware of its own presumed importance. Too often the characters are forced to mouth philosophical platitudes that are obviously Miller's and not their own. The film's best moments come, not when the author thinks he has something important to say, but when the characters have ordinary lives to lead. The film is a collection of bittersweet scenes, some of which are quite compelling, but, as the title implies, don't come together as a whole. Just as the film tries to demystify Marilyn as the ultimate female icon, the story seems aimed at de-mythifying the image of the American male. Though tailored around Marilyn, it is a film about men; appropriate possibly because Marilyn still exists primarily as a male fantasy. It is a modern day Western -- far from the glitzy comedies that made Marilyn a star -- which strives to challenge the cowboy and the West, as both mythical images of America and icons of the cinema. The image of the American cowboy as a strong, silent symbol of idealism is chipped away with little subtlety to show images of fading machismo and frail desperation; more an anachronism than a fantasy, let alone an icon. THE MISFITS has been deemed an Eastern Western, designed to allow a jealous Miller, the nerdy Eastern intellectual pessimist, to get his revenge on the eroticism and optimism of the traditional male hero.The film has a spooky quality to it. There is, of course, Marilyn as Roslyn, in Reno to get a divorce (just as Monroe's own marriage is in its last stages), running from the man who, it is suggested, truly loves her (Kevin McCarthy, possibly representing Miller himself). She briefly finds solace and protection in Isabelle, played with her usual cheerful sadness by the inimitable Thelma Ritter, who, like Marilyn's real mother, disappears abruptly from the story, forcing Roslyn to fend for herself. Roslyn finds companionship with three men the ironically named Gay, an aging cowboy played by Clark Gable (himself a symbol of fading Hollywood glory); Perce, a battered and deteriorating rodeo rider played by the battered and deteriorated Montgomery Clift (who like Marilyn has become a gay icon); and Guido, who, as played by Eli Wallach with a disconcerting mixture of graciousness and lust, seems to be Miller's vision of Monroe's male fans. Gable is the nominal love interest, but it is at best an uncomfortable pairing -- not just because of the age difference, but because it is hard to believe that Gay would tolerate Roslyn's erratic behavior -- just as Gable had trouble dealing with Monroe during filming. Just as Monroe and Gable don't quite fit together as either lovers or co-stars, Huston's directions seems constantly at odds with Miller's narrative. As Huston strives to instill a sense of respectful realism into the storytelling (filming on location in Reno and the Nevada desert, for instance), the arch, self-aware, self-important dialogue penned by Miller rings false in its theatrical pretentiousness. The subsequent deaths of Monroe and Gable, as well as Clift, give the film an undeniable poignancy, but it is a sentiment the film doesn't earn in its own right.THE MISFITS was PC long before political correctness existed, seeing the taming of the west as something more akin to an act of rape rather than something heroic. It is an anti-Western that seems to denounce the very imagery of the American west that Huston's camera can't help but celebrate. Yet, Huston can't seem but to embrace the glory of the western landscape and the quiet dignity of his male characters. Huston creates a warm -- albeit, misshapen -- valentine out of Miller's attempt at a bitter, unforgiving eulogy.

A shame then that the film is so disappointing. It starts with some pretty decent promise. But it soon slows down considerably and really starts to drag. And by the end it is just painful, the final scenes just excruciating to watch. There's a pervasive sense of doom throughout, real-world happenings can't help but color the way you view the film. You know Gable would be dead before the film was ever released and that Monroe would be gone a year later. Co-star Montgomery Clift had only a few films and few years left. You would hope this film's great stars would get a proper send-off. Sadly, this film provides no such thing.All three stars play, as the title would imply, misfits. Their characters have no place in the world. Monroe plays Roslyn, a young woman who has come to Reno for a quickie divorce and has no plans beyond that. Gable plays Gay, an aging cowboy longing for a world and a lifestyle which no longer exists. Another misfit is Guido, played by Eli Wallach. He's lost his wife and is unhappily working as a mechanic. Guido and Gay have an aversion to working for wages. They don't want to get a real job. Gay, Guido and Roslyn wander out into the desert to Guido's unfinished house. Gay suggests they can make some money rounding up wild mustangs, that's the type of thing macho old cowboys do don't you know. Meanwhile Gay is falling for Roslyn. Guido is too. Well, of course they are, Roslyn is Marilyn Monroe. Roslyn meanwhile is completely oblivious, living in a daze. Sadly poetic for Monroe who at this point in her life was past the point of no return. Monroe does manage to pull herself together for a decent performance though. It could be said she's the glue holding the film together. Of course if Marilyn is your glue your film's got problems.If Monroe comes off well enough in the film the same can unfortunately not be said for Gable. Playing the aging cowboy proved to be a rather undignified end for the aging actor. One scene in particular where Gay makes a drunken spectacle of himself is painful to sit through. Gable deserved a better end. He probably could have done without being dragged across the desert floor as well. Clift, playing a broke and broken-down rodeo man, doesn't fare any better than Gable. His character is rather lifeless. Honestly the whole film proves rather lifeless. After an interesting setup it fizzles out very quickly and just keeps getting worse, and more boring, as it goes along. And those final scenes are almost unwatchable. The whole thing is rather sad. The film doesn't work as entertainment and the specter of real-world death lingers over the whole thing. The only reason for the film to be remembered at all is that it was the end for Gable and Monroe. They deserved a much fonder farewell than this. Monroe turns in a decent performance, no small feat considering what was going on in her life at the time. Gable's character is so flawed it would have been impossible for the actor to make anything of it. He sadly exits the stage in rather inglorious fashion. The final performances of these legends makes The Misfits a notable film. Notable but extremely disappointing.

I was going to try to tie him into one of my favorite, modern directors, Oliver Stone; but it seems people, in general, were just stronger, grittier and more resilient back then. Today - everybody, like the reviewer who said he/she saw this movie when it first came out pointed out, seem to always want to SEEM/APPEAR so abstract and complex in their descriptions (parroting others as he/she stated) while not seeing the trees, as they ARE, for the overwhelming forest. I guess we all have our own path, influences and connections to the meat of life. To me this movie was very interesting in how the characters DID break down into something different...showing/REVEALING their more vulnerable, softer underbellies. But people of today act like we're above this behavior when we ALL are pretty much the same a good show/front at first, but something inside that reveals a different hue later. Marilyn Monroe's character reminded me of an old girlfriend...so caring for everything, but an inability, HERSELF, to see and/or accept things as they REALLY are. So full of connecting to OTHERS'lives (out of a sheer NEED to do so to even exist) that she constantly gets distracted from any real path to understanding her own. Gable's character (and to a large extent Clift's and Wallach's as well) are so busy being men that they don't really know anything else until someone like an irresistible Roslyn comes along and VEXES them (as beautiful, substantive women/people do) into seeing things another way. But EVERYBODY has a vulnerability deep down under the apparent clothing and other outward facades we learn to craft from youngsters. The reason I said this movie seemed ahead of its time is because, even when horses were still regularly eaten by people in the US (and still are here in/on rare occasions and OPENLY in many other countries), Marilyn's character (Roslyn), with her innocent, naive aversion to killing ANY living thing, was, in the end, able to even convince a rational, realistic character like Gable's/Gay (who poignantly pointed out the hard fact that FEW things live in this world without something else dying) to free the captured horses headed to the feed grinder for the animals (something STILL done today...as many societies STILL/CONTINUE to consume/use horse meat). The movie reminded me of the hypocrisy of modern words like liberal, free thinking and green...in relation to people's CHOSEN lifestyles. It is so easy for people to SAY they are something these days...like so many modern women saying I'm a lesbian (when they would have NEVER professed this 10 years ago) or someone saying I don't believe in killing things with a face (though they happily dine on McDonald's and wear fur and leather). Monroe's character WOULD be like this/that in today's world. So sensitive and thoughtful, but REALLY just as cold as ice below the surface as anyone else when it came down to the nitty gritty (as revealed when she coldly made the comment to Wallach's character 'your wife wouldn't have died if the car's battery wasn't dead'). THAT is reality. THAT was the brilliance of Huston. Monroe's character showed her true side then (in the first part of the movie)...while the men had to be broken down (sound familiar fellas?). I respect a world in which a person eating a steak would have no problem cutting the cow's throat...or skinning the rabbit...or valuing a human life over that of a dog or cat or pig (an animal more intelligent than dogs or cats - yet we readily munch on them with no problems yet scorn those who consume cat and/or dog meat). This is why Europeans (and other foreigners) have contempt for Americans (though they still, of course, YEARN for America's freedoms). Many times we (Americans, as great as we ARE) seem so FULL of ideas over here when, IN REALITY, we're more full of the same things ALL the creatures mentioned in this long review discharge from their posterior. At the end of the movie all the guys MIRACULOUSLY become humane (like Marilyn) and free the horses. Gable's character didn't go down without a fight, though (showing his dominance over the animal)...and Wallach's character ALSO revealed how he REALLY felt in the truck. Clift's character was the ONLY man who GENUINELY seemed capable of change (I guess due to his sensitivity from a strong Madonna complex brought out by his enchantment with Monroe's character). But in the end they were all vexed by a hot piece of ass (as Marylin certainly was, but DEEPLY captured her own essence in this, her last performance)...and ALL would have gone back to being the same PEOPLE they were if/when she was gone. We're all the same people. The most devout pacifist will cut the throat of another living thing if it came to their own survival. And the hardest killer (cowboy or soldier) will, like Clift's character, EVENTUALLY, breakdown and crawl into Mommy's arms. This was a story about us all...transient, largely undefined travelers in time and space.

(Why else would anyone want to go there?...Oh, yeah, Gambling) And in no less than 5 minutes (straight out of divorce court) Roz has already got 3 drunken, old buzzards (Gable, Clift, Wallach) sniffing and salivating around her like she was a prime piece of meat for them all to gobble up. Each one of these crusty, old vultures is hoping to be the one who gets to tear off the biggest chunk of Roz's lovely, lily-white flesh for his greedy, little self.What a sorry sight these 3 drooling, crotchety, old has-beens make. It's really revolting at times to watch the way they all clamor over Roz. Each one seems to believe himself to be a real prize. A prize that Roz couldn't possibly refuse.I know this sounds incredibly shallow, but this is pretty much the story-line of this movie. It doesn't really get any more involved than this.In a way these 3 crusty, old farts reminded me of a grotesque version of The 3 Stooges (Curly, Larry & Moe), but this time their punch-line is failing, miserably. Gable is, without a doubt, 'King-of-the-Grotesque-Ones' here. I really hated it when it turned out that this wrinkled, bow-legged creep was the one that sweet, young Roz chose to hump with. UGH! Gross-to-the-max!! I don't understand why 3 dashing, young cowboy-romeos couldn't have been chosen to fill the roles of Gable, Clift & Wallach.

If you didn't think that these 3 smiling corpses (Gable, Clift & Wallach) were repulsive enough, they prove themselves to be even lower than dirt at this point.They head up into the mountains (with the unsuspecting Roz) and there they round up a family of 6 wild horses (including a magnificent stallion and a beautiful colt).

They trap these marvelous creatures to sell them at 15 cents a pound to some heartless animal-food manufacturer who'll slaughter them and then grind them up into dog food.Can you believe it???......And you wondered why I called this movie review Meet the MisFARTS!!???......Now you know why! What makes this movie worth the price of admission is Roz's realization that these 3 old dudes are in reality nothing but savage scoundrels, who would sell their own grandmother's dentures for a buck, if they could. Roz's response is excellent.But, unfortunately, a happy ending was tacked on to this film and I could no longer look at Roz as being above these 3 jerks. No way. The happy, crappy ending pretty much reduced sweet Roz to their lower-than-low level in no time flat.

Doomed to succeed, having no other option but to be the sum of all their personal catastrophes reflected in the story and etched on the screen, The Misfits seems to be cut from the same ilk that almost sunk Herman Melville's career after Moby Dick. It was just right for the time.Between Clark Gable's carelessness for his failing health, smoking as much as three packs of cigarettes a day and doing his own stunts (at the insistence of John Huston) even at age 59 and who would go on to die that same year of a heart attack, Marilyn Monroe's chronic addiction to alcohol and pills and her failing mental health that caused her to be repeatedly late on set, only matched perhaps by Montgomery Clift's heap of personal and health problems, writer Arthur Miller rewriting scenes on the set to spite his estranged wife Marilyn and finally John Huston closing down the set to indulge his chronic addiction to gambling, when three out of four protagonists of the film would be dead within five years of completing the picture, it's indeed a wonder The Misfits was even made. And boy are we lucky it was.The lives of four misfits playing out over a span of days in the arid Nevada plains is only the stepping stone for Miller to ruminate on the fear of commitment, the fleetingness of life, the repressed anger and guilt and remorse a man gathers inside him through the years and in the end all things existential. Their female companion, Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe), acts as their conscience, reminding them of what was lost and what can still be gained, becoming for a few days their lost mothers and wives. In the end she's the only one that remains unchanged. Miller peels back the layers from his three male protagonists, revealing behind the facade of sweet, good-natured and independent drifters all the bitter and furious anguish, sadness and remorse, all a life of broken dreams left them with summed up in their fear of commitment to a steady job, a life of normalcy. All the seething malice, betrayal and bitterness simmering behind the western dream.And to the challenge of arranging order in this tangled web of ideas and personas larger than life rises John Huston, much a misfit himself. He lets Clark Gable be the gruff but good-natured man's man he knows to be and he lets Marilyn be her absent-minded self and speak in her breathless voice as though she's making love to the picture. He lets Montgomery Clift be the sensitive, wounded man he knows to be, the man that was still as good looking as he was a terrific actor, even after his road accident in '57 that had Elizabeth Taylor pulling teeth from his throat. And finally he becomes what Orson Welles told Bogdanovich he would like to be most (even though his pictures were inevitably as flamboyant as their creator). He becomes invisible. He directs the film with the surefooted confidence of a veteran that has nothing to prove, has no further ambition than to make a strong movie. Unpretentious, stripped of all fat and down to the point, Huston becomes the guiding hand the movie needs.And if Arthur Miller's existential ruminations sometimes come across as forced and trite, other parts of the script become electrifying in the hands of people who were closer to their last bows than they might have known. When Gay (Gable) gets up all battered and bloody from the horse he just tamed near the end of the film, you can almost feel him having the heart attack. Despite the few false notes here and there, The Misfits is an undisputed classic.

Legends abound throughout the production both in front of and behind the camera. Directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, this is a movie about the last of the cowboys in what apparently was the only frontier left in the early 1960's, the Sierra foothills of Nevada. The last gasp act for these desperate men is to rope wild mustangs from a speeding pick-up truck, so they can sell the carcasses for dog food. It's an intriguing, fragile premise, but the treatment here seems too vaunted. Starring three screen luminaries of towering magnitude - Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift, the film falls short of its lofty ambitions but not for lack of trying. There are isolated moments of great power and poignancy, but the core problem is really Miller's ponderous and rather misguided script, full of pretentious soliloquies that may work for Willy Loman but not for characters who are supposed to be inarticulate by their very nature. The net result is that you rather feel sorry for the actors as they put in a valiant effort to transcend the material. Miller wrote the screenplay expressly for his then-wife as their marriage was falling apart, and it's a miracle that Monroe ended up with a solid role that capitalized on her strengths given that his post-mortem tribute to her, After the Fall is a scathing indictment of her memory. But above all else, there is a morbid cloud that seems to darken the tone of the film, and one wonders if Huston was responding to the fragile state of the actors involved.In what turned out to be her last completed film, Monroe extends on the promise she showed in Bus Stop five years earlier. Still stunning with an unbelievable magnetism, she was growing into a highly instinctive actress capable of conveying deeply felt emotions. With the combination of her beauty and vulnerability acting as the elusive flame around which the three men hover, Monroe uses her childlike innocence and unexpected wisdom to make her forlorn divorcée, Rosalyn, a more fully dimensional woman than she probably was on paper. It is one of the very rare occasions when she is the emotional center of the story, and she is particularly effective in reaction shots when she lets her eyes express her emotions for her. Her climactic banshee cry about the cowboys being murderers is a startling moment and a sad glimpse into what a wonderful actress she could have been given the right roles. In his valedictory role as well, Gable still has the old Hollywood star wattage and natural machismo to bring credibility to his aged cowboy, Gay, showing unexpected sensitivity in some difficult scenes. He lets the sadness come through his smiling eyes as he begins to realize his rugged lifestyle is quickly disappearing, the prospect of wages growing near and that everything he values is running off with the horses. Perhaps Gable was inspired by his Actors' Studio colleagues to trust his instinct in exposing his vulnerability, but it does backfire badly during his extended drunken scenes where it is discomforting to watch him overact with such broad strokes. It's also painful to see him wrangle the wild mustangs at the end with the knowledge of his looming death, but credit is due him for bringing authenticity to these challenging scenes.Clift, probably as much an acting polar opposite for Gable as he was for John Wayne in Red River, is quite touching in the smallish role of Perce, the cowboy with the most open-hearted infatuation with Rosalyn. Poor Eli Wallach is saddled with probably the most contrived lines of Miller's script and the least sympathetic character, a mouthy braggart who is the first to meet Rosalyn and then suffers the humiliation of witnessing her growing attraction to Gay. Special mention needs to be given to Russell Metty's stark black-and-white cinematography and the excellent art direction by Stephen Grimes and William Newberry. Yet for all its virtues, this remains a deeply flawed movie and frustrating for anyone who has the right to expect more from this group of amazing artists.

Some of the finest actors of the late 50's early 60's, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Eli Wallach, Montgomery Clift, Thelma Ritter are gathered together in Reno, Nevada by the master John Huston. Marilyn plays Roslyn, a woman coming to Reno for a divorce. She meets the cowboys and pilot and the plot thickens as Roslyn tries to regain her independence and her life while the men (as men always do) vie for her attention. All the while, there are the wild horses that I personally feel are the mirror image of Roslyn, wild, untamed, yearning to remain free and alive, yet at the mercy of men who only want their needs and wants fulfilled. Marilyn Monroe is haunting in this, her last role. She and the writer, Arther Miller, who wrote this as a valentine for his wife, were experiencing extreme marital difficulties while this movie was being made, including John Huston's recounting of her leaving Miller in the middle of the f*#@*%g desert, they divorced soon after the movie ended filming. I think much of the pain and hurt Monroe transmits on the screen stems from the failure of her marriage and the fact that Miller let her down. Gable, while paunchy and obviously several years older than Monroe, still has the charm and magnetism that made him the perfect Rhett Butler 20 years earlier. The fact that both stars, Monroe and Gable died not long after filming ended also adds a poignancy to the movie. The movie has it's problems, the movie drags at times, and tends to get melodramatic, but the scene when Marilyn breaks down in the desert when the men are trying to round up the wild horses to be destroyed and sold as dog food remains her best acting and it proves that Monroe was more than a pretty face. This is a movie that deserved to be a huge hit, but I think was misunderstood. Well worth watching.

Marilyn Monroe arrives in Reno for a divorce and has no idea what to do with herself, so Thelma Ritter (always a great supporting actress) takes her under her wing. A bit later, they hook up with Clark Gable (an aging bachelor cowboy) and a man who has a place to rent (Eli Wallach) and they strike up a friendship during the course of an impromptu party.After years of being on his own (he'd been married a long time ago), aging cowboy/rodeo performer Gable is tired of his tough life and seems ready to perhaps settle down with Monroe. As for Monroe, she's interested but still confused as to what she wants to do with her life. A potential relationship between the two seems to be brewing.A bit later, as the four friends are driving down the road, they notice Montgomery Clift sitting by the phone booth in the middle of nowhere. Gable and Wallach recognize him and stop. They take Clift to the rodeo where he proceeds to get the snot knocked out of him! During both the bronco and bull rides, Monroe practically comes unhinged trying to get Clift to stop and she cries hysterically until she learns he's bruised but otherwise okay. At this point, it's pretty obvious that Monroe is quite taken with Clift...and that Monroe is very tenderhearted towards animals and Clift. In addition, over time, the extreme differences between Gable and Monroe become terribly obvious and you know this relationship is doomed. See the film for yourself to see how it all plays out in this unusual film.As for the film, I liked it in some ways. The story was very unusual and quite original. The parallels between the five wayward people who were misfits and the horses was interesting and the story could have worked...but I couldn't help but think the power of the script was undone by a case of producers pushing too hard for names--big name actors to try to draw in the public as opposed to letting the story speak for itself.I dunno, but I was surprised by Marilyn Monroe's delivery in this film. Despite zillions adoring her and some rave reviews, I think her performance was terrible--by far the worst in the film. It seems that throughout most of the film she sounded like she was impersonating someone with emphysema--as she kept breathing louder and louder and taking huge breaths in the middle of sentences. Frankly, I think she sounded like Stevie from Malcolm in the Middle and can't understand why she played her part that way. Perhaps all of her emotional problems were affecting her performance, as this was the last film she made before her untimely death.As for Clark Gable, he was good in the film but seemed oddly cast. Having this aging actor play against Marilyn Monroe just didn't seem to work--the same problem Gable had in It Happened in Naples when he starred, just a year earlier, with Sophia Loren! You wonder why he kept agreeing to films like these. Perhaps he didn't want to acknowledge that he was nearly 60, but he just didn't allow himself to age gracefully in films like Cary Grant did.Now I don't know about you, but I was surprised to see Clift in such a rugged role. While I know he'd taken a few similar roles in the past (such as RED RIVER and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY), but with his super-slight frame and looks such roles seemed ill-suited to him...though they seemed like good career choices in hindsight. As for me, I didn't mind his acting but just thought Clift was silly as a rodeo cowboy--especially with his refined and very non-western voice.In fact, this is my criticism of the film--too many people just didn't seem to belong in Nevada. I think with a different cast, they could have carried off the plot a bit easier. As a result, it was a good film but an oddly surreal film at the same time--and very tough to accept. It was as if believability was unimportant and star power was the only serious concern.Overall, an interesting experiment that's worth seeing. But, sadly, not much more.

She was in her early 30s then and her chaotic lifestyle was starting to show on her face. I didn't find her relationship with Gable to be believable in any way.

The two quickly hit it off out on a ranch owned by the widowed Guido (Eli Wallach) who secretly has a thing for Roslyn. Soon the three hit it off with a rodeo star (Montgomery Clift) and it becomes quite clear that they're all troubled people trying to make their way through life. THE MISFITS will always be remembered for being the last film of both Gable (who suffered a heart attack two days after filming) and Monroe (who would be dead just over a year) and it's a real shame that the two legends didn't go out with a better film. There are countless documents out there discussing the various production issues that happened before, during and after filming so it's a miracle that the movie was completed at all. With that said, the screenplay by Monroe's then husband Arthur Miller is quite poor but then again legend has it that things were being re-written daily. While watching the movie I kept asking myself what it was suppose to mean because scenes just drag on and on for no apparent reason and then when the scene is over you realize that not a single thing happened. Characters come in and out of the story, the characters do strange things and soon in the end it really just appears to be a film about troubled people doing troubling things. None of the things really add up to be much but I guess this could be blamed on the various production issues. With the incredible cast you can't help but want to at least watch the movie once and for the most part they deliver. Gable was born to play this rugged part and he's quite believable as this worn down cowboy. Monroe seems to have been the most effected by the screenplay and you can tell simply by how different her character is early on compared to later in the film. Some might call this character development but it really isn't. It just seems as if there's something wrong with her in the later portions of the picture where she seems dazed and not that interested. Her early scenes are actually very good including a great sequence where she dances with the men just shortly after her divorce. Wallach is actually the best in terms of performance but Clift can be counted on for good work as well. Supporting players Ritter and Kevin McCarthy are fine as well. Huston's direction is really all over the place but I'm guessing he didn't have too much control over what was going on but you'd think he could have at least given it a little life. As it is the film is pretty boring without too much energy. THE MISFITS really isn't a good film and considering the talent you can't help but call it incredibly disappointing but at least the stars left us much better out there.

Gable died of a heart attack just after this film, and Monroe the following year of a drug overdose, they were real stars! Anyway, basically Gay Langland (Gable) and Roslyn Taber (Monroe) met each other in a restaurant, just after Roslyn had decided to divorce her husband. Isabelle Steers (Rear Window's Thelma Ritter) was with her, but that didn't stop the almost instant attraction. The rest of the film is basically their relationship blossoming, and almost ruined by the fact that Gay almost kills wild horses in front of her. Also starring Montgomery Clift as Perce Howland.

The location photography is beautiful, but the thing feels like the filmed play it is. The realistic style doesn't really fit the pointed, deliberate script. (It plays like The Last Picture Show, made a decade later). The weakness seems to be in the Miller material. There's a lot of talk, but Huston keeps things moving.
