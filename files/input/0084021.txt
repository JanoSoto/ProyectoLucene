I really don't think that is to fair considering the cast was totally different. Granted there was no super-star-pop-icon like Olivia Newton-John. There wasn't the hot-70's & 80's actor John Travolta. However, there were some great stars in this film. The writing may have been a little less than perfect...the direction might not have been up to par. But for me, being EXTREMLY young when both Grease 1 & 2 came out, I never compared the two. I think they are two different films with the same type of concept. The music was good. The dance scenes are good. & yes, even the story is okay. Grease mania is about being a devoted fan... that is something I am. I liked both of these films on two different levels. Grease without a doubt is the better of the two. But this one is not as bad as the negativity everyone feeds into it. If see one, see the other. Just note that they are both FUN movies! Nothing more. The sequel centers around Sandy's cousin Michael. He is in love with Stephanie, & trys EVERYTHING possible to win her over. The Pink Ladies are still cooler than ever. The T-Birds are not as tuff, but are sexy! 1-10 Grease(10) Grease2(8) Z.

It does have the same kind of formula as the orginal Grease but is dealt with in a completely different way. Danny faniced Sandy back, but Stephanie (played by the young Michelle Pfhieffer) doesn't even give Michael (Caulfield) a second glance.  Also, instead of cars, a motorbike is the new 'thing' to have.Michael Carrington, a straight A student from England, transfers to Rydell High and is immediately put into the 'nerd' category and the T-Birds brand him 'Shakesphere'.  He is smart, extremely uncool and very shy.Stephenie, the leader of the Pink ladies has come back from the summer holidays having broke up with Johnny, the T-Birds leader, having grown out of him.  Johnny is clearly still interested in Stephanie but she doesn't want to know.  Her loyalty to the Birds has faltered as she wants someone even cooler.First day back Stephanie sees the Birds picking on Michael and defends him, from that moment on Michael vows to become a T-Bird and win her heart.So there is the story, but what Grease is famous for is the memorable songs, and this film has them!  There are 12 songs on the soundtrack and there isn't one that I really skip.  The music has changed since the first Grease as it was made in the decade of the 80's.  Its early 80's rock that you are getting yourself into for the most part.  You have the romanitc songs (Turn Back The Hands Of Time, We'll Be Together, Charades), the heavy rock songs (Cool Rider, Who's That Guy), the happy-go-dancing songs (Score Tonight, Back To School), the sweet songs (Love For All Seasons) and the down right silly songs (Reproduction, Prowlin').  These are all songs that stick in your mind and just can't stop singing them to yourself.  All the songs are quality and stand on their own.  Absolutely brilliant soundtrack.What would Grease be without the classic characters?  We have the T-Birds who are actually not cool in any way or form, its only the leader (Johnny) who is 'cool', the others just follow his lead.  Johnny is a classic character who makes you laugh over and over again, its hilarious whenever he loses his cool.  Frenchy unfortunately doesn't have a big part in the film but nethertheless she is there.  The coach is back but you only see him twice if that.  Mrs Mcgee and Blanche are also back making quite a funny duo as they did last time.  Two new teachers; a very sexy female who always has low cut tops on and pays $500 for her hair (according to the cheer leading twins).  She falls for the unlikely nerdy substitute teacher, Mr Stewart, who teaches the immortal 'Reproduction' lesson.  The new Pink ladies have very distinctive characters, one of them is obsessed with her nose and doesnt come into it much (Rhonda), Paulette is somewhat the second leader in my view who has a crush on Johnny, she does have her own intentions but she does care for her friends; nothing like Riz.  Sharon is a bubbly flirty character who is the prey of one of the T-Birds (Louis) to get into bed. Then there is Dolores, Paulettes little sister who isn't a Pink lady but a pink lady mascot, she looks about 12, mouthy and carries a skate board everywhere.The performances were actually very good in my humble opinion, especially Max Caulfield who seemed very uncomfortable... and that is the way Michael is supposed to be!  He wins me over with those puppy innocent eyes, then when he is the mysterious guy he acts completely cool.  Max was a triumph. His voice isn't the best thing in the world but he didn't sing that much anyway.  Michelle Pfhieffer was wonderful as an actress and singer.  When you hear her sing you won't need to wonder why Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted her as Evita in his film musical and NOT Madonna.  She shines in 'Cool Rider'.  The whole cast was believable.  I normally sit back in films and watch peoples performances and dig at them but I didnt do that at all in this movie.This film has a lot of negative feedback as every one compares it to the Original Grease.  My opinion isnt common, preferring this one to the original, therefore my advice to you is to forget the first movie when watching this one.  It needs a chance!

It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original Grease, you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption.For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows&#133; 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (Score Tonight, Reproduction, Do It For Our Country, and Prowlin') without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds. 3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her.I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.

I used to ask the people buying about it, and they all acknowledged that it was one of the worst movies, but that there is something about it so lovable, and that the songs are terrible, but there's something about them so charming&#133; Now that I've seen the movie, I know what they mean.This movie is appalling in nearly every respect, but there's just something about it--perhaps how brazenly appalling it is--that gives it an almost hypnotic fascination. I love how the producers made only the most surface-level attempt to even appear 50s. The clothes, hairstyles, songs, and ways of speaking all scream 80s. I haven't the slightest idea why they decided to dress Michelle Pheiffer in things that essentially look like sweatshirts for the first half of the movie. And she's got on those huge dark glasses all the time&#133; making her look like early Debbie Harry. You just really have to wonder. As for the sets&#133; I don't think I've ever seen such low production values in a movie released by a major studio. The sets also are brazenly 80s&#133; When Michelle is being tutored, they are OBVIOUSLY in an Elias Brothers Big Boy! Couldn't they at least have found a 50s-themed diner? There is also a scene showing guys motorcycling through a subdivision that looks like 1985 Westland, Michigan, and another time--my favorite--when Michelle and someone are sitting out in what is obviously some municipal park, with a huge superhighway with massive 18-wheelers barreling by in the background. I really have to take my hat off. What's also charmingly appalling is how the producers made NO attempt to recapture ANYTHING you may have loved about the first movie. And I tell you, this movie makes the original look like Gone With the Wind. You really should be required to see both to appreciate what a graceful, charming movie the first one is. This is so obviously just a craven cash-in by whoever owned the rights (that's you, Allan Carr!) that, in some perverse way, only makes it the more appealing.Everyone in this movie looks embarrassed, but none more so that Michelle Pheiffer. Obviously WRONG in every way for the part, and obviously PAINFULLY aware that she's going to look like an idiot on movie screens across America, poor Michelle seems afraid to really put herself behind any expression, movement, or song, as though by staying as still as possible she can diminish the damage. The poor girl, you can really feel her pain, especially as she sings 'Cool Rider,' and tries to dance up that ladder and down. The thing about musicals is that the characters have to appear to be transported with joy or anguish to the point that they break out in song, and poor Michelle is just so embarrassed that it really clunks. Of course, ALL the musical sequences clunk massively. If you're not buying a musical sequence it just looks like a bunch of people idiotically moving around on a set&#133; and that's what we got here. Those poor, poor individuals.I was amazed how poor the sound quality was. I hear this has been improved on the DVD, but it's quite clear that they were aware that these people COULD NOT SING, and tried to bury their voices as deep as possible.What else? Well, I guess that's about it. Truly poor direction just adds to the general malaise. If you like bad, cheesy movies, they just don't get any better than this. If you are a fan of the original, you should definitely watch this, as it'll just make you love the chemistry, charming songs, and graceful story arc all the more.--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies www.cinemademerde.com "},{"Title":"My favorite kitsch","Date":"24 April 2005","Score":"15 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Musical","Review":" Okay, this movie is absolutely ridiculous, and if I was only rating its surface quality, my score would be much lower. The plot and dialogue are fraught with silliness, and if you watch carefully there are numerous little mistakes that should have been edited out. (Spoiler Michael's motorcycle right out in plain view of Steff, with him leaning on it, when he's hiding his cool rider identity from her.) Some of the songs are especially painful, particularly in the ultra-serious motorcycle heaven scene, and the choreography is just bad. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer dance and sing Cool Rider is terrible--she should not be dancing that way, or singing at all. One has to wonder why Crater Face was included as a villain in this film, because now his tormenting of the high school students is just sad. Then again, I have a soft spot for Grease 2 that I don't have for the too oft-shown first film. For one, just to get this out of the way, Maxwell Caulfield is gorgeous in this movie. If you hate the film, you can always (assuming you swing that way) just watch him. It's not as if his acting is bad, and neither is Michelle's, though her lines are. And Grease 2 is funny, in its own way--you simply can't watch Michelle dance and sing without laughing. There is a lot to laugh at--and even with--in this musical. Reproduction is fun to watch, if certainly campy, and a couple of the T-birds are entertaining (Leif Green and Peter Frechette's characters).As I said, I have a fondness for this movie that is pretty inexplicable, I know. It's not a classic film by any means. Still, I'd say if you're looking for a so-bad-it's-good that still isn't too incredibly awful, to laugh at with your friends, Grease 2 is worth a rental.

I hated the original and loved this one.As I've gotten older, I've come to recognize that the original is a better piece of work, overall. The music from the original is better when taken as a whole. The supporting cast of the original has better players. The storyline doesn't seem as convoluted at times.But there's something about this movie that holds on to you. It appeals much more to the age group pictured in the movie (i.e., junior-high and high-schoolers). The song Cool Rider and the scenes that accompany it in the movie rival anything in the original.The dialog is better in places and the interplay between the male and female leads are better, I believe, than in the original. The original movie's pairing of Travolta and Newton-John gave us a dimwit trying to woo a goodie-two-shoes girl whose performance was oftentimes wooden and uncomfortable. This one gives us Caulfield and Pfeiffer, and the interplay between an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years male lead and the wild child female lead.Adrian Zmed's supporting performance as Johnny still cracks me up and is one of the few performances from this movie that still entertain me as an adult.That's because outside of the performances of accomplished character actors Christopher McDonald, Eve Arden and Dody Goodman, the rest of this cast is just plain bad. Some of it is bad acting, some of it is miscasting and a lot of it is bad writing.What we're left with today, 20-something years later, is a movie that made a really good attempt to build on the original, but in the end, was the soufflé that fell. It's still better than most want to admit, but it could have stood a couple of rewrites and a little more attention to detail in the prospective cast interview room.

The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.2/10 "},{"Title":"Grease vs Grease 2 ---&; No Contest","Date":"1 November 1999","Score":"14 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Musical","Review":"  There is no contest, of the two movies, the no-doubt best is Grease 2.

Naturally, having seen Grease and like anyone else who saw it, I didn't think it possible to make a sequel.Either 'at all' or to make one that wasn't as good as the first. Now at that age, I did like the movie and understood it wouldn't star Travolta or Olivia Newton John (who were too busy making so-so or even worse films at the time.) I'm in my 40s now and I got to re-watch this last night, for the first time in about 11 years or so. First, sorry to all of you who truly love this movie, if you love it that's fine but I honestly can't like it as much as you do. ...but, you're welcome to your feelings.I feel the characters, some of the songs just don't have the heart that made Grease enjoyable for me.Unlike the first, it seems no one in this movie really cares about anyone but themselves and most of the dialog centers around sexual things...but! I can't totally dismiss it either. There are some good things in the movie, it's true. Too bad it's all in the first half only.As we know,in the opening, Sandy's cousin Michael Carrington has come to live in the U.S. and attend Rydell High in California like she did. In this case, he's a 'male' Sandy and Pink Lady and 'Stephanie Zinone' is the female 'Danny Zuko'. She of course thinks he's a nerd & uninteresting. He meet up with Frenchy (Didi Conn) as he gets off the school bus. It's not long before he's fallen for Stephanie, who's getting sick of the immaturity and bossiness of current T-Bird leader Johnny Nogerelli, who's only her boyfriend because she's a Pink Lady. Michael decides (despite Frenchy's Warning) to try and become a T-Bird type himself and win Stephanie's love & respect. In mere weeks (in movie time) he's practically Evel Knievel on a motorcycle, wearing a leather jacket and disguising his voice in a weird American voice. He single handedly takes on the T-Birds rival gang outside the bowling alley.Anyway, up to the point of the Prowlin' number, it's was a good movie. Then it all falls apart. Right after that is a somewhat dull scene in a diner with Michael & Stephanie. An even duller song by Caufield, the goofy fallout shelter scene and a bit later, the unbelievably embarrassing and badly staged 'Graduation Luau' .I have to say this, for being a young actress at the time, Pfeiffer's is the best actor of all in the whole film. .... but has no choice but to somehow get through the scene of her and Zmed in the boat in a round swimming pool.Johnny's actually trying to row his way out, when the rival gang shows up to wreck the place.... and her screaming Stop yelling at me! Another question...why ask Sid Cesar, Dody Goodman, Eve Arden to appear, when they really didn't give them much to do in the film? I feel their talents were wasted here. It's more like they're extras than real characters. Tab Hunter & Connie Stevens don't seem to add much to the mix either.The other problem here is, in the first half, the musical numbers are really good. Which gives the impression it's going to be a great movie.The opening number, Back To School Again (sung in a voice over by The Four Tops) is a great one. The dancing is perfect and the song's exciting.Other good numbers are Pfeiffer's Cool Rider (sort of 1980s Pat Benetar, being sung in 1961, with MTV like moves). Still, one of her best remembered moments in the film. Score Tonight (sung in the bowling alley) is more of a funny song than one to be taken seriously. Still, it works in how it's put together. Reproduction, despite it's tacky lyrics, is also funny and it's routine works too.In the 2nd half of the film, only,  Prowlin'  - Sung by Adrian Zmed (depending on your opinion of his singing of course) and You're Girl For All Seasons are the best.The rest of the songs, Charades (sung by Caufield w/ too much echo effect), Who's That Guy?, Love Will Turn Back The Hands Of Time, Do It For Our Country, Rock-A-Hula Luau and We'll Be Together ....are anywhere from dull to just really uninspired songwriting.There's even the bad edit from Stephanie & Michael starting the We'll Be Together number, to everyone already coupled up (including them) and slow dancing/walking to the camera. Topped off with some silly 'spinning and/or 'ballet' routine. So, all of this,is why I'm rating it 5 stars. A good jump start in the first half but a 2nd half that gets lost and runs out of gas on the way to the finish line.

She doesn't even misbehave, which is perhaps an indicator of how much the makers of this movie have watered down the contents of the original.

Good GUY falls in love with the sultry bad GIRL by totally changing his image and abandoning his sense of individuality. See? Totally different movie. Not at all a lackluster attempt to rehash the original and cash in on the American public's love for it. I'm reminded of Vanilla Ice's classic interview where he tried to explain how the main melody from his hit single Ice, Ice, Baby was totally different from the melody everyone accused him of copying. Yeah, see, their tune goes, 'ding ding ding ding ding ding. Ding ding ding ding ding ding.' And ours goes, 'ding ding ding ding ding ding. Diga-ding ding ding ding ding ding.' See? Totally different. Anyway, back to Grease 2. I liked the opening song, much like everyone else here, because it opened the film with a bang and was lightning quick and even a tad catchy. But then the song ended and Frenchie came back and the kids started singing about sex using really awful innuendo. And why did Frenchie come back, you may ask? Maybe because the filmmakers knew that without someone from the original everyone would realize how crappy their movie was even quicker than usual. I'm reminded of how they brought Screech back to Saved By the Bell The New Class. Yeah, that gimmick didn't save the overall project, either. Unless you want to see a couple in a bomb shelter singing about how they should 'do it' for America, I suggest you ditch Grease 2 and stay with the first one, which I also have a few problems with. Mainly, why did Sandy have to change her appearance and personality to make John Travolta like her? What kind of message is that to send to the kids who watch this movie so much and love it with all their hearts? That if you want people to date you you should refuse to have your own life and create brand new ones to satisfy them? Sorry, but that's not my philosophy on how the world works. Well, at least how it should work. I give Grease 2 1.5/4 stars, if only for the decent opener and the hilarious fact that Catwoman (Michelle) is in this big cornfest.

No-one expected Grease 2 to match or - heaven forbid - surpass the success of the original, but for the sake of the paying theater goer, they could'veat least tried.Make no mistake about it, Grease 2 is a terrible movie.  The potential was there to continue with the story of Rydell High School and the exploits of its students.  Only, the people in charge of this production thought it would be a great idea to not only make a sequel, but to remake the original. Because that's what Grease 2 is basically.Resisting temptation to use profane statements, the plot for this shambles of a movie is more or less the same as the original, but in reverse. Instead of the shy Sandy, you have the equally timid Michael.  He's from 'jolly old England' which roughly translated means he ain't as cool as his American cousins.  Michael is hopelessly in love with Stephanie - she's the hip chick,  by the way.  Problem is, she doesn't even know he exists because he's a 'square' and she's the head of the ever-so cool Pink Ladies.  So to grab her attention, Michael transforms himself into a mysterious 'cool rider'.  Well, the script writers thought it was a good idea...And...er, that's about it really.  The ending is more predictable than the original Grease movie, so you'll know the new kid gets accepted by the cool kids, and he'll ride off into the sunset........watch the movie to see who with (as if it'll come as a surprise).Grease 2 starts off well enough with a great opening number ('Back To School Again' by the Four Tops) and dance routine.  Still, everything nosedives 4 minutes later and you're left wondering why they even bothered.The acting skills of the assembled cast ranges from mediocre to dreadful, the songs are abysmal (listen to 'Reproduction' and cringe with embarrassment), the dancing (especially from Michelle Pfeiffer) is so bad you'll probably lose the contents of your bladder laughing and if that's what passes for comedy, hey! I must be dead because I never laughed once.But do you know what the scary thing about Grease 2 is?  Next year is the 20th anniversary and they're going to re-release it onto a new generation of movie fans.

It obviously carried on the success of the original Grease (fun music, fan atmosphere, cool actors, and so on). But, besides the first word of the title, the two movies have nothing in common.Grease 2 is the story of a total loser who, for some reason that still beats me, falls in love with a total bitch. Just to make the point The girl is the leader of some gang of sassy high-school idiots who call themselves pink ladies. They think cool, they act cool, and so on. The girl has only one thing that stands up for her She's Michelle Pfeiffer. Sadly, that's the end.The total loser is Maxwell Caulfield. If his name does not ring a bell, there is more than a good reason for it. Somehow, this guy manages to hide is nerdy loser identity and turn into a night biker (ops... cool rider) and impress the girl. The cool rider dresses like the Village People, but the audience is supposed to think he looks really, really badass. Somehow, his Village People leathergear is enough to make the girl fall for him---and even make other badass bikers jealous (the other bikers are similarly into the Village People). In the very end, the cool biker is revealed to be the loser guy. The girl falls in love with him and he even manages to gain the trust and respect of the other biker dudes.In case you did not get it, the storyline is a boy-meets-girls as braindead as it can be. Still, a screenwriter who actually finished high school could had made something fun out of it. Here, the fun and lighthearted atmosphere comes only from the music (which is still fun), and is used as a patch to cover the absolute lack of writing and directing skills.The direction is embarrassing. The camera simply follows the actors while they move around and sing. Sometimes they have some interesting choreography (the cool rider song) that the director manages to kill with a plain and unoriginal vision that makes everything look fake. Somebody might think it's intentionally camp. I still think the overall effects is that of a girl, with an expensive camcorder, who is trying to make a costume movie, with her friends, in her garage. The editing gives me the creeps, and is similarly unoriginal everywhere. The most stylish moment is the first time you see the loser guy acting as the cool rider. He appears out of nothing and lights up the girl's cigarette. The scence is a basic and plain alternation of the close-ups of the two. Most of the different movies scenes are lined up without any transition, giving the idea that the movie reels were simply cut after the director says action!, and glued together. In summary, Grease 2 is an astonishing example of how a bad move can gain following. There is no way to save it in name of the so bad that it's good taste. The reason is that this was not a bad, unskillful, B-movie. This was a reasonably priced production that just happened to gather together some of the worst crew around at that time, who just rushed to finish the movie in time. The only things that still makes it worth is Michelle Pfeiffer. But you have to watch the movie on mute, otherwise you would just want to kill her for the entire time.

One, the cast could sing. Two, the songs were memorable. Three, the choreography was great (Born to Hand Jive, anyone?). Unfortunately, when making Grease 2 no-one seemed to think that these elements were particularly important.I never normally feel compelled to write comments on here about the films I have seen. However, just having sat through the monstrosity that is Grease 2 I simply had to act. From start to pathetic end, this musical is terrible. It's meant to be set in 1961, but a lot of the songs (Cool Rider especially) seem to have been influenced by 1970s guitar rock like Meatloaf, so they seem completely out of place. The singing is appalling - why did no-one think to cast actors who could sing? Or just dub them with singers who could?! The music is even badly edited - take for instance Charade, where you can't make out a single lyric thanks to terrible diction combined with a vocal laid far too quiet on the mix. Most of the songs are multi-tracked for some strange reason too - so those weak voices come at you 4-strong at a time, making the overall sound very 80s. Some songs seem horribly out of place...why sing a really chirpy song when Michael (aka the Cool Rider) is presumed dead, then finish with a slow ballad for the finale when it's discovered he's alive and his identity is revealed?! Rama- dama-ding-a-long it ain't.As for the choreography - look at the song set in the bowling alley if you don't get what I'm talking about. It's supposed to be a big set number, so why is the dancing so unimaginative? Most of it just involves twirling around (a lot!) and throwing the suddenly miraculously light bowling balls!As for the cast, they all look incredibly old - the leader of the rival gang (also in the first film - forgive me not knowing the character's name but he's the one who dates Cha Cha) could easily pass for 45. Pfeiffer, here in an early role, is grumpy and petulant for most of the film, leaving you to wonder why Michael goes to all the bother of wooing her in the first place. Her singing is dreadful, her face inexpressive, and she gets the frumpiest outfits of all the Pink Ladies.Finally, numerous plot points are unexplained Why are the T-birds, so cool in the first film, now bothered about a stupid talent contest? Why do they all now ride bikes instead of cool cars? What happens to Frenchie - she just disappears halfway through the film?! Why is Sandy's cousin Michael English, when she is Australian? What happened to the end of year funfair in the first Grease film...we now get a cheap Lu-ow (sic) instead...run out of budget did we?I suppose if you want to have a quick look, it has a certainIt's so bad it's good quality, which is why I suppose some people have voted this film a ten, but in reality it's painful to sit through it all. Fans of Grease would be better off imagining and writing a Grease 2 of their own - frankly a trained monkey couldn't do worse.

I'm sure that John and Olivia might have done a sequel if it had been discussed right then and there while they were filming Grease but since time goes by ,people move on. The only original cast members to return were Didi Conn , Eve Arden ,Sid Caesar and I think the leader of the Scorpions. They introduce a whole new class of T-Birds and Pink Ladies who are neither interesting or particularly funny. The T-Birds are more moronic and are actually made to look bad ,the Pink Ladies are no longer the fun group of gals either.And the plot is nothing more than role reversal ,from good girl in love with bad boy , to good boy in love with bad girl. Maxwell Caufield as  the boy and Michelle Pfeiffer as the girl. The only relation to Grease is Caufield's character is supposed to be Sandy's(Newton-John's) cousin. Michelle Pfeiffer plays one of the new Pink ladies who supposedly can only date Greasers and so Caufield transforms himself into some silly anonymous biker type to turn her on unlike Newton-John who didnt transform until the end of the show. The big problem with this movie is its predecessor, trying to get 2 people to fill the shoes Travolta and Newton-John left behind was way too much to hope for. Caufield and Pfeiffer have no real chemistry and the acting is really wooden between them. The songs are forgettable too. And Adrian Zmed ? Who the hell casted him as the leader of the T-Birds ? Besides the obviously overblown pompadour haircut which is probably a wig ,he cant act,sing or carry any scene that hes in. Didnt he later on play a cop on TJ Hooker? total nobody.

And in that, I had more respect for the first Grease movie, which stared John Travolta (pre Saturday Night Fever) and Olivia Newton-John (Post Have you never been mellow?) It was a good career jump-start for both of them, and aside form incorporating cheesy disco numbers into the soundtrack, it stayed relatively the same as the musical. And, it was a huge success.Not so for Grease 2. Whose great idea was this?Let's make the guy a shy, prissy wallflower and make the girl a gang member? Normally, I'd be all for the gender-swapping, but the way they went about it was horrible. The supporting cast--everyone from the T-bird leader (adrian zmed) to the blonde bombshell (Lorna Luft) was just off. Lorna, well being a member of a talented family, never got to prove herself playing such an out of place Marilyn Monroe Wannabe. And casting another disco king as another greaser did not give Zmed the same success as Travolta. Because face it, acting just isn't Zmed's thing. the rest of the T-birds are annoying.

Some of the criticisms are admittedly on the mark. In particular, Didi Conn reprising her role as a post-graduation Frenchy never quite works; the attempt to link to the first 'Grease' film by making the male protagonist Sandy's cousin is also forced. 'Grease 2' is, however, a better film than one might expect from its reputation, and its reversal of the original movie's formula makes for a more engaging story. Whereas the first film was about an out-of-place teenage girl giving in to peer pressure and conforming to impress a guy, here it is the guy who has to conform to impress the girl. In both films, the message offered (conformity is good) is hard to swallow, however, as the transformation this time is more gradual (not all of a sudden at the end), it is easier to get under the skin of the protagonist here and feel for his mixed emotions. A refined Maxwell Caulfield also makes for a more appealing lead actor than John Travolta, who acted pretty smug throughout the whole of the first film, and while Michelle Pfeiffer is no better than Olivia Newton-John, she is certainly no worse on the acting front; singing is another matter.

I have found both Michelle and Maxwell a very charming on screen couple. They had a great chemistry and portrait the main characters very well(Max was hot and Michelle OMG lovely). On the music side, I was blown away by the songs. If you're saying they are bad, you probably haven't even bothered to listen to them in full. Straight after watching I have ordered the CD. It may have not generated so many hits like the Grease One... maybe because of the short time-frame between these two movies. Like the other reviewers already said. Do not compare it to the original. Watch it as an independent production. If you haven't seen the Grease One watch this one first and then the original. I am sure you will like this one better.

But Grease 2 is down there with the worst. As a lover of musicals and of music and film in general, I disliked this movie significantly. Just for the record, I really like Grease, it isn't in my top 250 nor is it my favourite movie musical, plus it is a movie that has grown on me over-time, but it was good spirited, energetic, nostalgic fun with fun performances and great songs and choreography.Grease 2 has very little of that. In fact, it is almost the exact anti-thesis of Grease, it is dull, lifeless and predictable with poor songs and forgettable performances. The only real point of interest is Michelle Pfeiffer, while her acting and singing is nothing amazing she does look gorgeous and does try, bless her heart. It is just a shame that the other performers are so lacking in chemistry and energy, and she and the cast are further disadvantaged by songs with irritating lyrics and unmemorable melodies, barely tolerable singing(I've heard worse such as in Mame and At Long Last Love but it is still bad here) and slip-shod choreography.The dialogue is also very embarrassing, there isn't a witty or quotable line here, in fact I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the cheesiness. The story is predictable, badly paced and dull as well, and spoiled by cardboard characters who don't interact with each other very well at all. Worst is the direction, it is absolutely wretched. Patricia Birch doesn't seem to have an idea how to direct this movie, and when anything interesting or worthwhile happened which was occasionally, it is spontaneously hampered by some hideous camera shots.All in all, a mess of not only a musical but of a film. 2/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Lacks the magic of the original","Date":"26 April 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Musical","Review":" In 1961, two years after Sandy, Danny and the gang from Rydell High School graduated and went on with their lives, we return to the school on the first day of the school year with a new group of students, along with some familiar faces.Michael (Maxwell Caulfield), the British cousin of Sandy, arrives on the first day as students are dancing and singing. He is met by Frenchy (Didi Conn), the Beauty School Dropout who is returning to start her career in cosmetology by learning high school chemistry.Soon after arriving, he bumps into the beautiful Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first starring role), who is the leader of the girls gang the Pink Ladies, and the latest girl of Johnny (Adrian Zmed), the leader of the T-Birds, a gang once lead by Danny in the original movie.It is love at first sight for the well-mannered young man, but he quickly learns that he has to be a T-Bird to date her. But, he will do anything to get close to her.Now, Michael pursues his crush by turning into what Stephanie wants -- a cool rider who will sweep her off her feet.Let me say right off the bat, this is a very weak followup to one of the greatest musicals of all time. It just completely lacks the magic of the original film.First of all, there is the music. If you ask me, only two of the 13 songs are memorable. The rest, though having the sound of early-60's music, is just terrible and uninspired. To me, most of the tunes sounded as if they were just thrown together just before production starts. As for the choreography in these scenes, it's hit or miss. In the original, we get an energetic dance number in the school gym, which is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. In Grease 2, we get an out-of-nowhere number in the local bowling alley that the cast appeared to enjoy doing. However, I would not want to go back to learn these steps (and I am in a wheelchair). I also felt, with some exceptions, that the cast was taught the choreography the day before filming the dance scenes.One of the biggest problems is character development. To me, the characters seemed to have been written as if we are expected to know the new faces. Most of the main characters appear to be loosely based on specific characters from the first film (most notably Michael, a male version of Sandy with a bit of Danny thrown in, and Stephanie, a female version of Danny with a bit of Sandy thrown in). There are also many supporting characters with their own, minor story lines which barely moves the story along. We get only minor basics of these characters, and the audience mostly ignores them due to not being presented well.As for performances from the main cast, they are fairly good, but not perfect. Pfeiffer is near perfect in her first major role on the silver screen, and carries the weaker members of the cast fairly well in their scenes together -- and she can actually carry a tune pretty well (especially in Cool Rider, one of the only two songs you will most likely remember after the closing credits end. Caulfield was pretty good as Michael, even in his invented alter-ego to swoon Stephanie. However, there was something lacking in their romantic chemistry most of the time.The supporting cast, all around, is quite weak. Like I said, these characters are horribly written. We only get the most basic information. The T-Birds lacked the feel of being a unit, as did the Pink Ladies. We even get some of the original cast in this film, but they are only on-screen to deliver a line or two as the movie progresses.As for the wardrobes, nothing real special here. The gym shirts the men wear in one scene appear to have the school name ironed onto it, and not in a quality a school district would spend the money on. I found the wardrobe pretty boring actually. The Pink Ladies and T-Birds iconic jackets don't look that great on the cast members wearing them. And, especially with certain male members of the cast, the hairdos look too much teased. It looked as if they cut some corners on the wardrobes and hairdos to me.The story just feels rushed, especially the part where Michael creates his alter-ego. It appears that he became an expert in riding rather quickly, as there was no way to tell how much time had past.I really can't recommend this one. If you already own the first movie, I would suggest that you get this film just so you can have both movies. And that's the only reason to purchase it. It's just not able to live up to the icon that is the original.

Her drop in class and status is simultaneous with her spiritual awakening found in Michael.To properly examine the acting acting, the cinematography, the set design, the directing, could take a lifetime.

Four years later after the first film him, in 1982 a sequel was bound to happen with the same movie title with a 2 at the end.It's Grease 2! Same plot, different characters, new songs. Those are the key factors in Grease 2 where after the first song Back to School, we are introduced to Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) an exchange student from England who happens to be the cousin of Sandy (Olivia Newton John from the original) where he doesn't fit quite yet with Rydell High while being pushed around by a new pack of T-Birds with leader Johnny (Adrian Zmed) and his guys giving him a hard time. Michael falls for a girl named Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer in her film debut) in which she likes him but it'll be against the code since she's a pink lady (just like in the original) and don't go out with anybody but T-birds. What will Michael have to do to win Stephanie's heart?

Sid Ceasar is the coach; Dody Goodman is Blanche; Eva Arden is Miss McGee and Dennis Stewart returns as the bully to Rydall.

Of course it wasn't a surprise, and I'm sure that upon it's general release, there were one or two executives at Paramount Pictures that wished they hadn't even bothered making the movie in the first place - and the reason for that being is simply some movies should be left to bask in their own glory without being bastardised and diluted with one or more sequels. Grease 2 is one such example.Whether you want to compare Grease 2 with the original or take an unbiased view and appraise it on it's own, nothing can hide the fact this really is a terrible movie. So where did Grease 2 go wrong? For one, the entire movie script is more or less a rehash of the original (albeit in some instances, the male/female roles have been reversed to disassociate this from being a straight remake). Take the main love angles in both movies for example in the first movie, you had the cool kid (Travolta) falling for the square new-kid-in-town girl (Newton-John), and in the sequel, it's the same, but the roles are gender reversed. Originality seemed lost on the script-writers, and this was further evident during the whole movie, especially during the end-of-school-year carnival where the 'square' kid (Michael) is finally accepted - a scene that's blatantly ripped off from the original Grease.The original Grease cast never won awards for their acting abilities, but compared to those relative unknowns (back in 1982) who secured the leading roles in the sequel, they make John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John seem like Oscar winners because their acting abilities ranged from 'acceptable' to 'dire', with the latter description perfectly summing up the majority of the cast of Grease 2. Moreover, the injection of old, supporting actors from the first movie (Frenchy and Eugene especially) seemed questionable too. Granted, teachers were understandable returnees, but Frenchy returning to Rydell High two years after she left to supposedly enter 'beauty school' (and dropped out almost immediately as her character explained in the first movie) and, like the Eugene character, had already graduated. Why were they even in the movie, other than to make an association between the two films? To give the casting people credit, at least for the second movie they hired actors who, at least, looked like teenagers which couldn't be said about the first Grease.Whereas the soundtrack is what the original will be best remembered for, the songs used in Grease 2 were a lot to be desired. With the exception of the terrific opening number (Back To School Again performed by the Four Tops) and Who's That Guy? (with the former being the best song from both movies IMO), the quality of the songs matched the acting ability on show. Prowlin', Do It For Our Country and Reproduction were all appalling and the worst on offer; Cool Rider and the sexual innuendo laced, Score Tonight were passable as songs (even if the accompanying dance scenes were so bad, they were actually hilarious - see Ms Pfeiffer strut to Cool Rider and you'll see what I mean); Charades is actually a lovely ballad, or it would've been if someone other than Mr Caulfield had sung it, yet it was quite 'dark' and featured in something of a noir-ish scene that didn't really belong in the movie. The rest of this rather short soundtrack is made up with what can only be described as uninteresting fillers.As for the characters themselves, it seems the 'Pink Ladies' have become the most dominant gang at Rydell High because those characters are the most strongest, especially the roles of Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Paulette (Lorna Luft). Despite the fact that the 'T-Birds' epitomised everything cool in the original, they seem to have turned into a group of geeks in this movie. Adrian Zmed (Johnny) and Christopher McDonald (Goose) are certainly no John Travolta and Jeff Conaway, neither were their characters. Didi Conn reprised the exact same role she had in the first movie as Frenchy, someone present in the movie to introduce the new kid to the ways of the school and what it took to be 'cool'. Unfortunately, in Grease 2, we'd seen it all before and her character seemed 'tired'. To their credit, Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield played their characters well, and unlike the majority of the cast, they did seem 'believable'. Pfeiffer, in the role of the street smart, hard-as-nails head of the 'Pink Ladies' and Caulfield, the stereotypical upper class British teenager (of 1961) did have something of an on-screen chemistry, but were sadly let down by their supporting actors.It really is unfair to compare this movie with the original, but it is a sequel after all - a movie with more than just a few connections to the first, so it's understandable that's the view people will have. In fact, there's no comparison at all. The original was great&#133;. this movie isn't. It really is as simple as that.

The director has tried to fit too much colour, too many plot elements, and too many (largely unfunny) humorous interludes into 115 minutes of film.  These teenagers aren't just a little bit naughty and likeably rude, rather they are all-out hussies and juvenile delinquents.The plot is a carbon copy of the original film.  A foreign student enrolls at Rydell High, immediately develops a crush on the leader of the school's socially elite clique, and spends the rest of the movie trying to make themselves cool enough to be dateable material.  One of the movie's few successes is the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer as the head of the Pink Ladies.  She is both real and charismatic.  Unfortunately the same can't be said of her opposite, Michael (Maxwell Caulfield), who never really gets into the feel of the film.  Additionally, his voice is too light for his character, and at times he appears to have difficulty holding a tune. Song-wise the best of the bunch are the first and last tracks (Back To School Again and We'll Be Together).  They are catchy and snappily choreographed chorus numbers, worthy of inclusion in the Grease franchise.  The rest of the soundtrack wavers between mediocre, appallingly sentimental and plain ridiculous.  Whoever decided that a neat scenario for a song would be to have a biology class singing about the pollination of plants (with the mandatory sexual undertones of course) should have been fired on the spot.  Don't sully your 'Grease experience' by watching this.

Aside from the fact that all interest in this concept had virtually depleted in the four years since Grease, there's nothing here that could resurrect it for an audience. All the fun, & magic of Grease is missing. Uncharismatic actors do not help the situation one bit. They tried hard but failed miserably! Adrian Zmed is no John Travolta & you can't help but think that every time the schlub is on screen. Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful & at least they had the good sense to pair her up with Maxwell Caulfield, who's just as pretty. Yet he's a wet noodle with zero personality & no screen presence whatsoever, despite his good looks. Poor Didi Conn gets thrown into this madness for familiarity, then is tossed aside & forgotten about. This movie is not a pleasant experience. The motorcycle-heaven hallucination sequence that Pfeiffer falls into during her Girl For All Seasons number is murky & disturbing. They were going for an exciting Beauty School Dropout number & ended up with a big, hot mess. There's also one too many endings & the lame finale leaves a bad taste in your mouth with that unclimatic, ho-hum, wishy-washy, watered down We Go Together wannabe song. Lorna Luft gives her all but a Marilyn Monroe sex symbol type she ain't. The dancing is clumsy, & the songs are quickly forgotten. This movie just makes you want to watch Grease (& appreciate it) & forget you ever sat through this in the first place.

I made the mistake of getting my hopes up over Grease 2. I didn't watch the entire thing, just the first 30 minutes, but I will say this I want my thirty minutes back.What little part of this film I saw, I watched while babysitting the kid next door. She's, what, five, give or take a year? And this is one of her favorite movies. I pity her. This movie is a piece of junk, no two ways about it! That's where the disappointment came in.Now, you may be wondering about the appalled part of my summary line. That's easily enough to explain. You see, the little girl I babysat has two older siblings--one about 8, and the other 10. They really like the movie too, and that bothers me. Some of the lines in the songs are very frank in their sexuality. That's not so bad for a five year old who simply won't understand them, or the equally suggestive dance moves that accompany them. A ten-year-old, however, will. I'll be the first to admit that I am literally one of the most liberal, open-minded people you'll ever meet, so it isn't the content itself that I object to. What bothers me is that it's contained within a musical that people let their kids sit down in watch without thinking to worry (since the parents themselves probably wouldn't be able to stomach much more than the first 10 minutes). What I'm basically saying is this the movie might amuse very small children that aren't paying attention to the lyrics. The tunes themselves aren't too bad, and the dancing can be amusing, especially when you *aren't* paying attention to the lyrics. Older children--about ages 7/8 to, oh, 11, probably don't need to watch this. If anyone above the age of 12 can sit through this entire movie, they have my complete and utter respect--I don't know how they do it.I give this movie a 2 out of 10.

Sure John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were good looking people, but they weren't as hot as Maxwell Caulfield (SO CUTE) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Plus, I even thought some of the songs from this movie were better than the ones in the first. Hopelessly Devoted To You, Beauty School Dropout, and Sandy were incredibly cheesy songs.

My favorite Grease 2 tunes are Back To School Again, Score Tonight, and Cool Rider. I love, love, love Michelle Pfeiffer starring and singing and performing in Grease 2. Without the worthwhile Michelle Pfeiffer there's really no telling how bad it might have got. Grease 2 is enjoyable at times though it is consistently bad, but it isn't too unsavory and it tries so good.

The film is just more musical numbers and hijinks from the kids at Rydell High. Only this time, the new kid on the block is a guy trying to impress a cool chick. As opposed to a goody-two-shoes girl trying to win over a cool guy like we saw in the original. There are some cute songs and funny moments, but the two leads (Caulfield and Pfeiffer) just cannot live up to Olivia Newton-John or John Travolta. Not even close. First of all, neither can sing terribly well, and generally you'd like your leads in a musical to be able to sing. It really helps. Caulfield is somewhat more likable in the underdog role, but Pfeiffer's acting is really poor. She was a pretty face and little more at that point of her career. Her song Cool Rider is one of the film's worst. While singing it, she does look kind of sexy while climbing up to the top of a ladder and then straddling it. But then when she gets down she starts doing something resembling the Elaine dance from Seinfeld. Thumbs in the air and all! Weird. Director/choreographer Pat Birch should have fixed that.There are some good performances from some of the folks playing the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Adrian Zmed provides some chuckles with his false bravado in many scenes. Chris McDonald who plays the Goose has been a solid performer in movies and TV for years. And you're telling me Lorna Luft is a daughter of Judy Garland? Who new? Its good to see some of the faculty members are back from the original, but Didi Conn doesn't seem to belong. It seems like the producers agreed and just kind of wrote her out of the movie by the third act.It's really kind of odd how this movie has been aired seemingly more than the popular original over the years. It didn't hurt Pfeiffer's career (nor did marrying producer David E. Kelly), but this movie destroyed Caulfield's before it even began. He has kept somewhat busy, and was even considered at one point for the James Bond role. But he's never been the star he perhaps could have been. Grease 2 isn't all bad. It's worth about 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Michelle Pfeiffer would have to sneak up behind you in a darkened room, while you were just dropping off to sleep and scream BAD at the top of her castrated-chicken singing voice right in your ear for the word to convey any sort of sense of how campily dire this movie is....  First of all, this was directed (nominally) by one Patricia Birch. Why did nobody tell Ms. Birch that you can do this thing with the camera that's called panning? To her, this word seems to be nothing more than a description of what the critics did to her movie, and she seems completely unaware that it's also a form of camera movement. Hence she moves around scenes with cuts. All. The. Time. Which. Makes. Things. Kind. Of. Choppy. The result is that the movie looks like it was shot with a $12 polaroid instamatic camera and the pictures were then taped together. And Pat, sweetie, I LOVE that close-up shot of the back of Michelle Pfeiffer's head... Secondly; come on guys, you can tell us now. Was there actually a script? Or did you make it all up on the spot?Thirdly; Maxwell Caulfield. Sooooooo pretty. Sooooooo much prettier than Michelle Pfeiffer. Soooooooo unable to carry the movie. Or sing. Or, apparently, act. To be fair to Max, he does put in a decent performance in The Boys Next Door, and the storyline here doesn't exactly help (It seems like he gets about 5 scenes in the whole movie, Michelle gets 7 and Adrian Zmed gets the rest to himself) OK, so the guy's singing is fairly horrible, but he's supposed to be the hero. And given that there was supposedly a massive search for the leads, shouldn't they have thought about that earlier? Pfeiffer is screechy enough to scare off Celine Dion. Zmed can sing a bit. (He does in Bachelor Party too). BTW, in real life, Max is married to Tabitha Lennox off Passions. And Adrian Zmed has also been on Passions. And Matt Lattanzi, who plays Brad here, was married to Olivia Newton John in real life. But I digress.  Fourthly, fifthly and sixthly Oh God, the music is so awful! And yet I can't get Score Tonight out of my head. Continuity If Michael's dead, who's playing the talent show music? And check out the 1980s cars driving past in the background when Max and Michelle are in the diner. T-Birds Hello, these guys are a bunch of wussies. They should turn their bikes over to the girls and start using the pink Studebaker...Seventhly When climbing all over the dead motorbikes and singing about turning back time, wearing spangled jumpsuits, running in slow motion through dry-ice and cheap fades, didn't Max and Michelle get even the TINIEST inkling that this was not going to be a very good film at all?And in spite of all this, I watched the whole thing to the end of the credits. And past the Paramount logo. And I just spent five whole minutes writing this review (longer than was spent writing the script). It's that kind of film. Bad.

Some of the actors had so many effects on their singing voices (I guess to make it tolerable to listen to), and it was still impossible to hide the fact that they just sang flat, had no viable range, and basically were really not bona fide singers.  Besides the fact that the songs were so inane it was pathetic.  I'm sure some of the actors like Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield (mostly stage work these days, Broadway, et al) who still have a career in acting actually cringe when they know this movie will be on TV.

But, to be honest, although it has it's good bits, Grease get's boring very quickly - I couldn't stand the cheerleading scene and it is very cheesy. But Stockard Channing and John Travolta were probably the only good things about this movie; and 'You're The One That I Want' is pretty catchy, too.What I can't understand, is why people can't stand Grease 2, and they haven't even seen it. Being a big fan of sequels, I think that it's harsh to label them 'pathetic' without viewing them. I can think of 3 sequels right now that are better or as good as the originals - Scream 2, Return To Oz and Batman Returns, and I must say, Grease 2 also fits in there.Michelle Pfieffer is nothing short of brilliant as her role of Stephanie Zinone - the hot chick of the school who's been sought after by 'cute' nerdy boy, Michael Carrington (fairly weak Maxwell Caulfield) She has the best lines (like in that Hamburger restaurant) and to my surprise, she can actually sing. Everyone who's seen it says that Cool Rider is the BEST song on this movie - and it is!(Superman II's) Maureen Beefy, (Judy Garland's daughter) Lorna Luft, and (Grease's) Didi Conn also feature here, and give notable performances. Cast originals Eve Arden, Dody Goodman and Coach Calhoun return, too.Along with Cool Rider, there are also some other good songs. Reproduction is one of the funniest songs written, (Love Will) Turn Back The Hands Of Time is pretty nice and Score Tonight is lively and fun.Altogether - this as good as sequels come (baring in mind, I've never watched any of the Godafther films and don't care to) and I give a wicked 7/10 - plus ½ extra for Michelle!!

It is sporadically entertaining, and it does have a few things going for it. The early screen appearance of Michelle Pfeiffer is interesting to watch, and I enjoyed her performance. Almost all of the actors are quite likable, actually, giving energetic and engaging performances. And the film boasts the welcome return of Dody Goodman, Eve Arden and Sid Caesar from the original Grease.So what is the problem? First of all, the storyline is rather far-fetched. Nerdy English student (Sandy's cousin...yeah, right) falls for Pink Lady who wants nothing to do with him, so he learns to ride a motorcycle amazingly quickly and becomes this mysterious cool rider while the other characters don't even recognize him. I guess it's a Clark Kent/Superman kind of thing. Secondly, the songs are nothing to write home about...actually, the songs from the ORIGINAL film weren't that terrific either, but at least they became hits. Most of the cast members aren't particularly strong singers, but their dedication and energy almost makes up for it. The direction is sluggish, and the editing is poor. But the biggest failure here is the blandly-handsome Maxwell Caulfield in the lead role of straight-A/cool rider Michael Carrington. His performance is dull, his diction is poor, his screen presence is non-existent and his singing is pathetic. And he hasn't done anything noteworthy since.But honestly, the film isn't all bad. Stupid and forgettable, but not necessarily painful. But it is far from a must-see. Watch only if you are too tired to get up and change the channel and the remote isn't working.

The only thing one can say about this movie is that it has more of a plot than the original movie, other than that and the fact it has a young Michelle Phifer in it is about the only positive things one can say about this movie. The songs in this one are simply dreadful, when Phifer sings about how she wants a cool rider one can imagine all the dogs in the neighborhood lifting their heads and howling. Sadly that is probably one of the better songs in the movie. Stupid attempts at humor are made in the form of an awful bunker scene along with another horrible song and the whole film looks bad compared to the original. That film looked like it was set in the 1950's and had that feel. This one looks like it was shot in the 80's and only minimal things were done to make it feel like whatever era it was pretending to be in.

It was the first and last feature film she would direct to date. The film had a troubled production history from the get go, as John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were rejected after opening talks to resume their roles from the original film. I would guess they probably wanted too much money. After that, it was all down hill as actresses and actors rejected the film left and right. Michelle Pfeiffer finally took the role of Stephanie Zinone and Maxwell Caulfield the role of Michael Carrington. The film has many of the familiar faces of the original, including Didi Conn as Frenchy, Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Dody Goodman as Blanche Hodel, Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun, and Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felnic. Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens are on hand as teachers.What the film doesn't have is the infectious energy of the original and star power. After the opening number Back To School Again, the musical numbers fall flat and are less inventive. Maxwell Caulfield, although good-looking, has zero charisma. Michelle Pfeiffer's character is annoying after a while, and her T-bird boyfriend (played by Adrian Zmed in his film debut) is just obnoxious. The film has several production errors which are obvious to even some casual observers, such as the motorcycles dated ten years or more after the time of the film (1961) and the multi-colored basketballs from the ABA several years before they were introduced. This film actually almost broke even in the end, despite its poor reputation, but its lack of mega-success put the kibosh on more planned sequels and a television series. *1/2 of 4 stars.

Although the first one is just a classic and John Travolta could not have been any better than he was i agree with people when they say that it was boring at times (watching it once is OK but when you love it that much and watch it over and over again then it will get a bit boring) so when i watch it now i skip a lot of parts. Anyway, we're talking about Grease 2 now!I give Grease (9/10) but i give Greae 2 (10/10), i'd give it more if i could. Every actor deserved their part and it was nice to see Blanche and Miss McGee (the dynamic duo) again in this film, Frenchy's appearance showed it as a follow on from Grease but it shouldn't be told as a sequel (although it's the best sequel ever), they should be treated as two separate films as they have different story lines and only a few of the same characters (i think it may not have been AS good without these characters). Grease 2 is a treat and i love it, although one main reason may be because the leading lady has my name but i also love the actors, the humour, the music and just the plain simplicity of it. Maxwell Caulfield (Michael), Adrian Zmed (Johnny) are gorgeous, Peter Frechette (Louis) is soooooo cute and Christopher McDonald (Goose) and Leif Green (Davey) are just plain hilarious. All the pink ladies make great pink ladies and the ending couldn't be more perfect; everyone has someone and it's so romantic.

The dance sequences practically copy the original Grease movie step for step. Sadly, it is hard to watch this as an independent film OR a sequel, as it follows the same mold too closely - it is a blatant rip off. All the characters are the exact same stereotypes and half the one-liners are even identical. There's the leader of the T-birds, the cool side kick, the two ditsy followers, likewise with the Pink Ladies. Then of course there is the teachers, crater face etc, all the same characters but with different names and played by different actors. The only thing different about this movie is that their cool wheels are motorbikes not cars, and the roles of the two lead characters are reversed (i.e the female is the cool chick and the male tries to change so that he can win her heart). Truly a very hard film to watch if you have ever seen the original Grease, which is such a high energy and timeless movie. I'd only recommend it if you have never seen the original movie.

For every Godfather II, there are dozens of More American Graffiti's, Stayin' Alives, and Grease 2's. While the original Grease is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.Reviewers have complained that, because Grease 2 is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's, and the only nostalgia evoked is for Our Miss Brooks and Sid Caesar's Comedy Hour. The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, Grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.

Before I die, I may teach some film classes. One exercise would be for us to take some stock Mac software and with that alone take some horrid movie like this and fix it. Only a few are likely candidates. This is because the editing and music is so very bad that if the thing was edited expertly, with energy, and the songs were completely redone, it could work.The editing first. Why this is such a good case is that the story never matters much in things like this if it has other charms. So knocking as much as a third or even a half out of it would be okay. The actors are completely without interest, which could be a plus we can just make them all part of the background blizzard. You couldn't just pick among the shots, you'd have to zoom, crop and pan among what you had. You'd probably have to mix some sequences and present some others as flashbacks, forwards or sides. Maybe you could mix in some footage from other films &#151; or even new custom footage &#151; just as rhythmic filler. You'd have to noodle with the color. Its nothing here, nothing at all. Once one team of students built a cinematic pulse with enough long form arcs to matter, and maybe even some new dialog, they'd pass it to the sound team. I imagine all sorts of solutions here with woven genres that continue from beginning to end, to a simple redoing of the existing songs but competently and engagingly.

Its possible to make a simple movie designed to sell records &#151; where the big money was in those days. I liked Flashdance, even on a recent viewing.But when contempt for the audience, lack of art, plain inability to live and rough handling of hired talent combine, its worth actively condemning, in the hopes that it may deter future manhandlers of our most precious gift imagination in love.

I love watching the male leads, I love the cheesy songs, particularly the dream sequence during the talent show, and I love seeing Michelle in what I think is the role in which she looked most beautiful, save maybe Scarface. Today it was on again for the thousandth time, and yes, I did wonder how they allowed for the fact that Michael wasn't playing the piano during the talent show, but then I just pretended that he was only needed for the auditions as they could have had someone professional play for the real show. OK, OK, indulge me. The point is, considering that my favourite movies are more serious films like Deerhunter, Scarface and Cool Hand Luke, there's no way you can argue that I simply have no taste. It's probably more appealing to women anyway who like watching hotties like Maxwell Caulfield and who appreciate singing and dancing in films. Even if the singers are far from good. Who cares about 18 wheelers in the background and Maxwell's bad voice and Michelle's bad acting?

Within the first week of school, he's fallen for the head of the Pink Ladies, Stephanie Zinone (played by then newbie, Michelle Pfeiffer. Wow, I guess when they say you have to start from the bottom and work your way up, they really meant it, eh Michelle?) But Stephanie isn't looking for a nerd like Michael, she's looking for a cool rider! One that rides motorcycles in skin tight leather! So basically, the movie is a simple gender-switch of the first movie, following Michael's quest to change his image and win over Stephanie.One thing that is disappointing is that this movie had so much potential, but never lived up to it. They could have given us a bit of history about the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. But do we get it? No. They could have given us some exciting new types of music that could have made this installment just as good as the last. Did we get it? No. There are plot holes throughout, and lacks a lot of originality. Did we need another mushy love story? No, we already saw that in the first movie. The original stars didn't come back, so I think the last thing they should have done was repeat the story! They could have shown us how one becomes a member of the T-Birds or The Pink Ladies, other than looking hot. But did they tell us? No. Their was just suddenly a new batch of Pink Ladies and T-Birds, and I suppose there's a new batch every year, but leave it to Grease 2 to never explain it to us.How are the new T-Birds and Pink Ladies selected? We'll never know now. This movie had so much potential, could have had new clothes, new music, new everything, but no. We basically get a gender switch of the original Grease, with the same music, same clothes, just different people, proving the producers and director were lazy and just looking for money, like they threw this whole movie together in 6 months.The acting is nothing great. The only people who shine in this movie are Adrian Zmed as the corky Johnny Nogorelli, Michelle Pfeiffer (who would obviously go on to do bigger and better things), and the famous Lorna Luft (Judy Garland's daughter), who plays Johnny's desperate stalker. However, leading man Maxwell Caulfield looks like he's trying to hard and comes off as annoying, unlike Olivia Newton-John was in the original version. Even Adrian Zmed looks like he's trying to copy John Travolta, but fails. As for the other T-Birds and Pink Ladies, they weren't memorable at all.The characters themselves aren't that great. They aren't very likable, and act like they just got out of juvee. The script is definitely lacking, and much of the dialogue is pretty bad and annoying.The songs? Well, some of them are somewhat catchy, but for the most part, fail at keeping your attention. The singing is also extremely;y second rate as well. Maxwell Caulfield sounds like he's struggling to hold a tune (wow how the hell did this kid get cast in this movie?!?) and the more professional singers such as Lorna Luft maybe get one solo throughout the movie, which brings me to another huge mistake in the movie. Who the hell decided to cast a bunch of unknowns in a big movie musical?!? And in a sequel to the highest grossing movies musical of all time?!? Bad move, very bad move.The film opens with Back To School Again, which is the best song on the soundtrack, mainly because none of the kids from the cast sing it. 15 minutes later, the gang bursts into a song about bowling called Score Tonight, which I guess was meant to be a big dance number/group ensemble, like Summer Nights was in the original. The song is catchy, except how does bowling relate to the movie's plot? It was a pointless song, and it was obviously just thrown into the movie for the sake of it. Were the filmmakers that lazy? Then Michelle Pfeiffer bursts into a song called Cool Rider. It's a good song, actually, except the dance she does is pretty goofy and distracting in a bad way. Also, the song doesn't sound very 60s, it screams 1982. Time warp, anyone? Then there's a song about Reproduction. See what I said about Score Tonight. Same thing applies here. And then there's a string of unmemorable songs in the movie as well.The movie lacks the magic the original movie had. It has no energy, and in the original the songs just exploded into your face, but in Grease 2, it doesn't lift off the screen. The characters aren't likable for the most part and it doesn't have any energy, motivation, and most of all, it doesn't have any effort. This movie claims to take place in 1961 when most of it screams 1982. Everyone who made this movie seemed to just be looking for money and not even caring about the movie itself. Hence, the laziness. I'm glad this movie flopped at the box office, because it proves you can't make it in Hollywood if you're lazy. So why did I give it a 4 out of 10? Because, even amidst all of it's terribleness, there are a few (and when I mean few, I mean few) good songs, a few exceptional performances (Adrian, Lorna, and Michelle), and there's a little bit of chemistry between the two leads, Michelle and Michael, most noticeable in the diner scene.

Unnecessary sequel, Why did they make it? blah blah blah.  It's almost as if you expect these negative comments.  First off, I want to go on record by saying I absolutely LOVE Grease 2...EVEN more than the first one.  Don't get me wrong...Grease was a great movie and a classic.  I am not taking anything away from that. But G2, to me, has more meaning.  I was graduating 8th grade when this movie came out (Oh God, I just dated myself).  I saw this movie 3 times in the movie theaters upon release.  2ndly, I think the movie is compared TOO much to the first one.  If it was named anything else and didn't have a 2 tacked on to the name, it might not be reviewed so harshly.  If it was called BACK TO RYDELL or something along those lines, who knows how it would have been viewed.  Yes, I will admit it that G2 DOES have it's flaws and faults.  I LUV Michelle Pfeiffer ever since this movie, but at times she DOES look like she wants to be somewhere else.  LOL!!  And personally, they could have given Michael and Stephanie a little more time together to get to know each other.  It might have made the ending a little more believable. Some of the acting is not great, but alot of the acting in the first one wasn't great either.All in all, this movie ROCKS!!  I know alot of people who LOVE this movie. It didn't make as much at the box office compared to G1, but I think it might have hit the 20 million mark after all was said and done. Obviously, not EVERYONE hates this movie.Another criticism about this movie was that it didn't have any of the original cast in it (with the exception of a handful).  It's funny, because Grease 3 is in the works, with ALOT of the original cast members (including ONJ and JT).  If this movie tanks, I wonder what critics are going to say then?Like I said...GREASE 2 is a great musical and should NOT be compared to the first one.  The music is upbeat and funny at times and it is a feel good movie.  My only complaint (from Paramount) is that the DVD should have had some of those deleted scenes and maybe an audio commentary by some of the cast members and perhaps a trailer.

Sure, you could argue Jaws 2, Halloween 2, any Friday the 13'th sequel, Godfather 3, and, perhaps, Matrix Reloaded sucked. But at least those films had some redeeming features. Not so here.Take two young actors (Pfeiffer & Caulfield) not known for their singing, and give them some crappy songs to perform. Toss in uninspired dances and staging, a ridiculous script and a cheesy look to the film and then sit back and watch the fun!Most of the original cast was smart enough to bail out on this turkey; while those who returned look uncomfortable about being there, with good reason. Did Didi Conn really need a paycheck that bad? And, of course, it's laboring under the immense shadow of the original. It never stood a chance.

Quite a lot of the actors just went over the top in trying to act cool, especially the T-Birds. They went WAY over the top in trying to act cool but it really just came out in such an unimpressive and pathetic way it was almost funny. Although having said that, they did do a bit more than the G1 T-Birds, and they did do one or two things they did that were funny, but of course I laughing at their pitiful expense. They are a bit like 1950's chavs in leather coats. And The Pink Ladies were just way too humble and were a bit bland. Even Michelle Pfeiffer's performance lacked spark albeit pretty good, and Maxwell Caufield was OK from what I remember(it's been a fair few years since I saw this film), and the people who returned from G1. Those twins have to be the most irritating characters of the film. Ugh! Thinking about them almost makes me want to throw up. They also have to be at least two of the most irritating characters in film history. And that song they do. Yuck! Sweet sugary gooey puke! And the music. God help me, the music! Most of the songs are cheesy, irritating, stupid, cringe-worthy, easily forgettable, tasteless, lack charm/emotional power/likable element, and no or pretty much no meaning to them whatsoever.The storyline is cheesy, fairly weak , it's typical, nothing special a bit sleazy and very unoriginal; they switched personalities with genders with the characters.

Most movies that i enjoy usually end up with an Oscar for best movie picture or something.Grease 2 is one of the few rare movies that i enjoy watching but didn't get any award.The way i see this is that Grease 2 is meant for a different type of audience.Back when i was in college, we (guys) had to impress girls in order to get them. We had to be cool, we had to be unreal (almost fake), we were creating an image to impress the girls. Of course, i don't do that anymore, (not as much. I'm married, got kids, and still got my motorcycle etc. But one thing that has changed since my college days is that i am more connected to reality now than i was in college.Grease 2 is about a nerds (maxwell) that wants THE Chix (pfeiffer ) but to do that he can't stay natural, he can't be himself so he has to impersonate an image. You see, this is exactly the daily reality for many teenagers. Observe how our teenagers behave today. No different than in Grease 2 (minus the music).I must admit, i was also a Geek guy trying to be cool, dreaming about some (impossible to get girl), when i was in college...and there was. Girls that (20 years later) i wish i had got even if my current wife is a very cute and sexy slim woman...Watching Grease 2 reminds me how i was in college. (like maxwell actually). To be more exact, i wished i was like maxwell. Because in Grease 2 he made it, he succeed getting pfeiffer. But in really it is much more complicated almost impossible for a Geek guy to get the most beautiful girl because the most beautiful girl usually can pick any guy she want.Being an educator in a high school, i can tell you that sex is probably to most spoken subject in our teenagers conversation and concern.To summarize Grease 2 (from a guy point of view) is a movie for anyone who felt at one point in their college year in love with an (impossible to get girl). A guy who likes to dream and do crazy things just to impress someone, a good guy in nature.Grease 2 is a masterpiece (atleast) for some audience...I give it a 10/10 to re-balance that thrash reviews this movie has got but the real score should be around 8/10 objectively.

It pains me deeply to watch a poorly cast main actor, whose name is so forgettable, unlike John Travolta, and a memorable Michelle Pfieffer whose role is doesn't even hold water - the chewing gum girl. However the single greatest mistake in this movie is the Producer's decision to forget the importance that in a musical, musical writers are the ticket to a great movie. The second mistake they made was to change the director from Randal Kleiser to a Patricia Birch. The formula of successes for Robert Stigwood in Saturday Night Live was the Bee Gees, and for Grease 1, it was John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. However, it was John Farrar's music that stole the show for Grease 1. In Grease 2 the only great music that comes from the entire sad movie was Reproduction, which turns out to be a comedy than a real musical. Assuming the relative interesting music, I believe just only one to be unique for Grease 2, while for Grease 1, you got Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights, Grease, You're the One that I want, and Grease Lightning. Grease 1 had 5 great hits, while only one not so great Reproduction, from then on the value of musical is not even any interesting. With poor scripts, bad casting, and a forgotten talented music writers, the movie is painful for me to watch. Way back in the 1950s, they proudly promoted their musical writers, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, and the hits were consistent with the talent of the musical writer, such as Oklahoma!, King and I, The Sound of Music, South Pacific, and then some. Then we have the enduring Henry Mancini, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Pink Panther, and other memorable movies just by the weight of the musicians. The producers such as Robert Stigwood basically got lucky, but didn't learn from any of their success, which I think was fluke, despite bad scripts from Saturday Night Fever, but didn't seem to learn from their success, and seems to go downhill. So in case I am wondering why Grease 2 failed, it failed in most every aspect that it is still a pain to watch that forgettable what's his face, British Actor, and somewhat uninteresting Michelle Pfieffer miscast and the lack of any chemistry between the two. Still it can be salvaged and become a hit, if the producers simply didn't toss away John Farrar, Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey like feminine napkins. If anyone thinks Grease 2 was poorly budgeted, its budget was 13,000,000 compared to Grease 1 where its budget is halved that at 6,000,000. So it is likely that they didn't care about the quality of music in a musical. If you want to watch a good musical, I think Grease 1, Chicago, Hairspay, Saturday Night Fever and Sound of Music would be it. But if you just wanted to see the movie without the need for any music and a Michelle Pfieffer fans, or what's his face main actor, then Grease 2 is better. All in all, I would like to give a 1, but decided to give 2 out of 10 for this because the title Grease 2 is a good one, other than that, there is no redeeming likeness Grease 1 other than the fact that it was done by the same Producers, who short-sightedness barely made any money from this mistake.

But otherwise, people can't fix on this movie because it's a sequel to Grease, which has to be one of the most overrated musicals ever.From the groovy opening number to the very sway-friendly finale, this film brings it all home with very few groaners compared to the multitudes of them in the original.

Grease 2 is the ultimate Sunday lunchtime hangover film, with not too much going on, just some light-hearted singing and dancing with a few scuffles to keep your ears open if not your eyes.I think that Michelle Phiffier is excellent and plays the role in exactly the right spirit, with the diner scene being one of the bests. It does not try to be the first film the only real connection is Rydall High.Take no high ideals into this film, just take it as the light-hearted bit of silliness it is and enjoy it.

I don't think anyone else has attempted a movie musical sequel, but as efforts go this one isn't too bad. Some original cast members return with the new faces, but this film for all it's charm, just lacks the sheer magic and energy of the original.Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caufield), Sandy's cousin, arrives at Rydell High. After receiving tips for school survival from first Frenchie (Didi Conn) and then Eugene (Eddie Deezen) he falls for Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer), head of the Pink Ladies gang. She's recently split up with the head of the T-Birds Johnny (Adrian Zmed), and is yearning for something better...The plot is an exact replica of the original, with sexes flip-flopped, motorcycles replacing cars and the cheese turned up. Sometimes this works (the musical numbers, while not terrific, are at least well-staged and performed with enough enthusiasm). Sometimes it doesn't work, as Adrian Zmed is a little too polished and smug to totally convince as Johnny and Eugene's role has been beefed up a little too much to the point where his perpetual nerdiness is irritating.It is still good fun, but the original was simply so much better and this film's mere existence only proves this.

Indeed, it is they who appear to be the 'nerds' as unlike the 1st movie, the T-Birds in Grease 2 really have no credibility and are scared whenever Balmudo's gang show up.Plus, there is some very cynical re-casting of some of the old faces from Grease, such as the Mr. Spears character and Coach Calhoun, etc, but they really have no role in the movie and you feel they are only there to lend some weight and collect a pay check.However, that said, Maxwell Caulfield really is excellent in the role of Michael, making his character believable and sympathetic, although despite the fact that he is the leading actor of the movie, he has curiously few scenes and it leads one to suspect that quite a few of his scenes hit the cutting room floor.I really found his scenes with Michelle Pfeiffer endearing, particularly at the burger-joint and during his 'Charades' song. What a talent he was and should really have gone on to become a major film star. What a waste, but at least we have his sincere performance in this movie to enjoy.

Everyone is coming back to school, sure it isn't the very next day, but I swear I got a Porkys II flashback. I just loved this movie, and...even a few of its songs. Reproduction was quite funny, Score Tonight was great, and very catchy, as was Cool Rider. Still, since Cool rider was Michelle Pfeiffers only solo song, it ranks up there anyway.

Hottie Maxwell Caulfield is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but while I normally like Michelle Pfeiffer, she seemed terribly distracted in this film, like she wanted to be somewhere else. Adrian Zmed was good as the leader of the T-Birds, but the others, particularly the guy that played Goose, were annoying, as was Lorna Luft who played Paulette.

Simply knowing that I willnever again reach the level of ecstacy I achieved on my maidenVoyage with Grease Too  has spun my life down a bottomlessspiral of despair.  This kind of magic doesn't come around often, and I think it has alot to do with an experimental program of the time which hadstudios hiring 'special' people to write incredibly bad jokes inpathetic movies in exchange for moderate tax breaks.  The musicis more or less on par with the script though I don't think there wasany equivalent program for songwriters - perhaps it was acoincidence that they ended up with 'special'  composers ormaybe the writer brought someone in from his day camp.The acting is among Michelle Pfiefer's most compelling work (theCool Rider sequence alone will send tingles down your spine) butthere is simply  no way anyone on this cast can keep up with thealways stellar Christopher McDonald.  He is gold from start tofinish, as usual, and perhaps the only flaw of the movie is that hemakes the other performers look like the amateurs they are. Grease is no longer the word.  The word is Grease 2.

I was 12 years old and this movie did so much for me I can't begin to tell you all. It made such a lasting impression on me and will always hold dear in my heart.  This movie not only gave us Michelle Pfeiffer in her first ever starring role, but it also gave us Maxwell Caulfield and some great music. I consider Michelle's Cool Rider to be one of the greatest pop/rock songs ever written! It may not be a great composition, but its the coolest, slickest piece of movie music since Greased Lightnin' and You're The One That I Want. This movie marked an end to an era of movie musicals and not since has there been any musicals of its calibur. I don't know where it all went wrong, but Hollywood stopped making musicals. This film is truly underrated. So many people can't see the fun and wonderfulness of this movie and it's a shame. People are so hung up on the sillyness of it, but get a clue, that is what movie musicals are all about. Look at every Elvis movie and look at Grease for goodness sake. A true classic and its really building a following nowadays. Grease.....it's still the word. The Music and Feeling Go on Forever. Pinks and Birds for ever!

The only noticeable flaw was the lack of period music that filled up the first films soundtrack. There are times when it doesn't have the feel of the early 60's and that could have been fixed with more backround music typical of the era. I think most people missed the way too subtle comedy touches such as the T-BIRDS smoking and chewing bubble gum at the same time. They are trying to look older and very cool, yet they are not willing to give up the bubblegum of their youth. Clever! The staging of its musical numbers is great in that it utilizes unusual settings such as a bowling alley, bomb shelter and a boys v.s. girls sex education classroom song. Maxwell Caulfield sings beautifully and and more than pulls his share of the weight of this picture, Adrian Zmed is less lucky and almost sinks the whiny but bouncy SCORE TONIGHT number.But then we come back to the very subtle comic antics of having included NUNS in the bowling alley production, singing and dancing with the rest of the gang! Inspired! Will any one forget the image of Michelle Pfeiffer straddling the ladder during COOL RIDER? Then to show her independence, turning her reversable pink ladies jacket inside out to show a shiny black jacket?Great images! The ending could have had a few more twists and turns ,but over all GREASE 2 is a lot of fun and in many mays surpasses the original in its creativity and boundless energy.

I first saw this movie as a child and it brings back some happy memories for me, so I may be looking at it through rose colored glasses. However, I feel that this is a campy film that is just meant to be a fun musical, not a serious film. If you go into it looking for that type of movie, you will not be disappointed. The songs are catchy and enjoyable and it is interesting to see Michelle so young (and singing!). The story is basic, but watchable (musicals are normally not known for their deep story lines). Check out an older Maxwell Caufield in Empire Records as a semi washed-up star (that's his character, not a personal comment!).

The songs were so bad, that if they had the same writers for the first one, they probably would have made everyone dance at the pep rally or something.  Just terrible!  I never thought of this until I saw the tv show 'stripperella' make fun of it. If you can tolerate the movie with all the bad songs then go ahead and see it.  I give it a 1.5 out of 4.
