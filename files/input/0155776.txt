[{"Title":"A sweet and colorful dark comedy that's still a little hard to swallow","Date":"21 January 2004","Score":"39 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Much like the candy that bears it's name, Jawbreaker is a sweet, infectious dark comedy that wants you to enjoy it for a good, long time.  Unfortunately, also like the candy, the film is a little hard to swallow, and it doesn't last as long or come on as strong as it's name would lead you to believe.  But even though you know that much candy is bad for you, you still want to have it.On her 17th birthday, popular girl Liz (Charlotte Ayanna, here as Charlotte Roldan), a member of the Flawless Four, is kidnapped by her best friends Courtney (Rose McGowan), Marcie (Julie Benz), and Julie (Rebecca Gayheart) as a prank, her screams muffled by a huge jawbreaker.  The prank goes horribly wrong, however, when Liz chokes to death on the candy.  Instead of going to the authorities, as Julie insists, Courtney devises a massive plan to cover up the death, a plan discovered by the unpopular and awkward Fern (Judy Greer).  To win her silence, Courtney makes Fern in her own image, renaming her Vylette and allowing her to hang and commiserate with the most popular people in school.  As Fern becomes intoxicated with her new-found power, Julie becomes more concerned with her friend's death, and Courtney spins a devious web of lies and trickery.  Enter Detective Vera Cruz (Pam Grier), the only person who may be able to get to the bottom of the crime.  But what does all this mean for the Prom?Writer and director Darren Stein as obviously seen Heathers a good number of times.  Like that classic film of teen angst, Jawbreaker is a dark comedy set in a high school, featuring an accidental murder of a popular student.  While Jawbreaker is certainly more colorful than Heathers, both in terms of set design and characters, it also comes off as a pale imitation.  The students live their lives in near-vacuums, with parents showing up only occasionally, and then only as ineffective or ignorant.  The impact of their actions on the community at large is only hinted at, and as a result, you never feel as if anything important in the reality of this film has ever happened.That being said, the movie is still pretty sweet.  Rose McGowan is cruel and calculating villain, terrifying in her powers of manipulation and contingency.  Julie Benz is the perfect toadie, existing only to buoy Courtney's already swollen ego.  Rebecca Gayheart's warm-natured Julie is a stark contrast to Courtney's Satan-in-heels persona, and Judy Greer is wonderful to watch as she goes from under-appreciated geek to power-mad diva.  Pam Grier is, as always, a pleasure to watch, even if her role seems too small.  The interactions between her and Rose McGowan are some of the highlights of the film.  A good supporting cast also deserves mention, most notably Carol Kane as the slightly daffy school principal, Marilyn Manson as a seedy barfly, and Ethan Erickson as the dumb jock being relentlessly manipulated by Courtney's sex games.While the script is full of caustic one-liners, it never succumbs to its own hipness.  The characters are witty, but not nearly as unrealistically urbane as the characters in movies like Scream.  Some scenes and interactions come off as gratuitous, and to be sure there are a number of times when Stein really wants you to notice to how well he paid attention at film school.  But there are a number of scenes that gain new meaning when analyzed in the larger scheme of the movie, and a repeat viewing may be in order to catch the full signifcance.  You may sometimes get so distracted by the candy-colored schemes (McGowan's lips alone may send you into insulin shock) that you'll forget about the plot.Some may see the movie as derivative, and there are certainly a large number of detractors.  But taken on its own merits, Jawbreaker is a fun, giddily dark comedy that requires more than few licks to get to the bottom of.  Just keep your consumption to a moderate amount, and you'll do fine.  7 out of 10.

I think part of its appeal is that it's a darker comedy, like Heathers--though this movie certainly isn't in the same league. Everybody in the cast gives fine performances. Rose McGowan's is a little over-the-top, but I think it fit the tone of the movie. The running time is about 85 minutes, so it doesn't go on long. There are plenty of funny moments that keep it entertaining. You can argue that the Karen Carpenter joke was too cruel, but that joke alone didn't ruin the film for me. The ending is certainly a cop-out. There could've been a MUCH better pay-off! But despite the fact that Jawbreaker is undoubtedly a flawed film, it's energetic and fun.

It takes plot points from Heathers, Carrie, and uses some originals of it's own to create itself. It's not a bad film. Actually one of the better teen films I have seen recently. It reminds me of a much more recent film I saw a few months back called Mean Girls. Of course that came five years later. This one has all very beautiful, and perky actresses that flood the screen at one time, much like Mean Girls. But Mean Girls was a film that was much more tame and lit the screen up. This one falls under a dark comedy.Let me just say I love Rebecca Gayheart. I had a childhood crush on her, and she's probably the reason for my love behind Santa's Slay. She's gorgeous, one of the most beautiful and underrated actresses in the business today. She gets a promising, and an effective role in this film. From her constant beauty on screen, to her sassy ways in the later parts of the film, she finds ways to surprise me. Very worthy, respectable part for her.The plot is about three teen girls named Courtney (McGowan), Marcie (Benz), and Julie (Gayheart) who, as a birthday prank, gag their friend Liz with a jawbreaker, and throw her in the trunk of their car. They drive for a brief time, before stopping at a diner, and opening the trunk to realize she is dead. She had swallowed the giant jawbreaker, and now the girls realize their stunt has gone wrong.To avoid trouble, Courtney calls Liz in sick, and they go to school like normal. Courtney (pretending to be Liz's mother) on the phone to give one of the girls Liz's homework for the day. The principal gives Courtney the homework, which she forgets, and another student named Fern Mayo (Judy Greer), a nerdy bookworm, is sent with Liz's homework. Fern absolutely adores Liz and her beauty, so upon arriving to Fern's house and entering, she finds the girls trying to cover up Liz's corpse with a faulty rape story.Fern now knows a secret that shouldn't have been told. She has the power of blackmail. Courtney assures the crew that Fern will become the missing link in the Flawless Four. They give Fern an amazing makeover, which she quickly takes to her head. Who could blame her? This is her first time she's been noticed. She's bound to let the newly given makeover get blown out of proportion. In the meantime, Courtney rejects Julie because of her wanting to do the right thing, and not take Fern for granted. Courtney basically says you're out bitch! and shuns her out of the picture. Courtney, Marcie, and Fern (now Vylette) are on their own. Hiding from a dark secret.Upon it's release, Jawbreaker was met with negative reception because of it's dim-witted cast and copycat like plot. While it does sample from other movies, like stated above, it finds ways to be unique and clever. It throws in some original material of it's own. I love movies about teenage girls. Not just coming-of-age films, but films where high school girls are their own worst enemy. Where they are both the protagonist and the antagonist. What fun these movies bring! Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz, Judy Greer, Ethan Erickson, Carol Kane, Pam Grier. Directed by Darren Stein.

So it is a bit of a derivative teen bopper flick.  But it's not a total rip-off and does stand on its own two feet.However, it's a fun movie.  And it has a great soundtrack, which I have. I love the use of the song Rock Me Like a Hurricane in the Marilyn Manson cameo.  Pam Grier also had an interesting bit role, as a tough-as-nails private investigator.  Jawbreaker  has its flaws, but it's fast-paced, energetic and sometimes pretty funny.The only big letdown was the ending.  Couldn't they come up with something more torcherous to do to Courtney?  Evidently, the writer Darren Stein was too anxious to complete the script and pasted on this snappy, thoughtless ending.

I like Rose McGowan but as you're supposed to, you don't love her. Rebecca Gayheart is the one you're supposed to root for, I couldn't stand her in this role. And the rest of the cast besides the school's principal, fell flat. That's not their fault, it is the faulty script. Unwitty dialogue and unclever antics make this film a downer. After accidently killing a friend they hatch a cover up scheme yet obviously someone is uncovering it. Now one friend must find a way to prove that her friend killed this girl. I didn't get that factor. It was an accident, yes it turned sick, but Courtney didn't actually, purposefully kill the girl. The ending is predictable, and there is crappy casting. I say this because Marilyn Manson is cast as a man that well... does... his real-life love interest Rose McGowan. It's odd, unfunny, and with a black comedy, it should be witty. This isn't.

But their harmless prank goes horribly wrong when they discover Liz has choked on the jawbreaker. The rest of the running time involves the girls trying to cover up the murder and bribing a nerd to keep her mouth shut.I am a fan of teen movies and black comedies. Assuming Jawbreaker falls into both of those genre's I was expecting to adore the film. The problem with 'Jawbreaker' lies in the fact that the conflict is set into motion within the first 5 minutes, leaving the rest of the film running of low gas. But it offers enough one-liners, laughs and style to make up for the flaws.Performances are good around, and a keen sense of the bitchy high school girl stereotype is cleverly constructed here. After all, everybody has a Courtney in their life. She's the girl who loves to be feared, and MCGowen does a great job pulling her persona off.3 from 4.

Cops and other complicating factors begin showing up at the worst possible moment, etc. etc. The comedic complications are mostly well executed, and the usual pangs of conscience and arguments among the conspirators keep things lively.

My favorite scene was at the beginning where the girls strut down the hall to Yoo Hoo by Imperial Teen. I've been mulling it over and I can't choose between them. They're both gorgeous. So as an excuse to watch hot women in high school, Jawbreaker is a success. As far as it being a black comedy, the results are decidedly mixed. I suppose it was trying to make the point that high school is war and its kill or be killed for popularity. It wasn't really a humorous point though.The movie starts off with a kidnapping of the most popular girl. They stick a gigantic Jawbreaker in her mouth to shut her up and toss her in the trunk of their car. When they open the trunk to get the girl out, you get to see the girl's corpse with the Jawbreaker lodged in her throat. This may not have been the best jumping off point for a comedy.

Daniel Waters's dialogue was a wonderful rhythm that he could never repeat. Michael Lehmann's direction captured a mixture of black comedy and drama that he's never been able to repeat. It could be argued that nobody in the cast (with the possible exception of Winona Ryder) has ever been better. Watching Darren Stein's Jawbreaker makes you realize just how difficult it was for Waters and Lehmann to make their film, because in every way Heathers succeeds, Jawbreaker fails.Jawbreaker has nothing new to say about high school, nor about popularity, nor about violence in society. So if you eliminate any hope of subtext, you can also wonder why exactly it doesn't seem funny. Or why the finale seems random an unsatisfying. Or why there's no character development at all. The dialogue isn't neither as smart or as barbed as writer/director Darren Stein seems to think it is, nor is the colorful and sometimes appealingly campy direction really a redeeming feature.The characters are all one dimensional. Rose McGowan, as Courney Alice Shayne, was given more to do in the crappy B movie Devil in the Flesh. She's always watchable, but she's usually more interesting. Rebecca Gayheart is supposed to be the character the audience can identify with, but her I remember when the dorky kids were my friends, back in fourth grade story arc is just ripped off poorly from Heathers. Everybody's easy to look at, but none of the young actors is going to put this one prominantly on their resumes.A string of amusing faces from the past pop up to remind you of a litany of movies that this is not. William Katt makes you yearn for Carrie. Pam Grier makes you year for a campier film like Sheba, Baby or a better film like Jackie Brown. Hell, Carol Kane even makes you yearn for the relative pleasures of a mediocre movie like The Pallbearer.Jawbreaker isn't funny. It isn't original. And it isn't very good. But darned if it doesn't invite another viewing of Heathers. And that's never bad.

Heathers is such a cult movie on its own, it's easy to compare Jawbreaker with it. Both involve bitchy high school girls, murder and dark humour.I find myself loving these kind of movies with black humour. They are stupid, absolutely, but for some reason they are absolutely hilarious. You just know people are going to hate the movie, and it's just part of the fun. The story is horrible yet so absurd it's almost funny. Of course the kidnapping gone wrong seems highly unlikely, yet it also feels plausible. I feel like I should be telling my friends not to try to kidnap me for my birthday. The characters aren't written so well, but they are fun. They are the typical archetypes of high school movies. Rose McGowan plays the most devious high school bitch I've ever seen in a film, and Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz and Judy Greer all pose as different kind of characters of the same type. I would've loved to see more of some characters, especially Vera Cruz portrayed by Pam Grier. When I saw her, I thought her part was going to be bigger. I was disappointed.The dialogue in Jawbreaker was just as good as in Heathers. It isn't actually realistic, because the language is extremely colourful, and no one would say several lines from this movie out loud because it wouldn't sound good in any context. But it works in a movie. There are so many details in this movie I love, but one thing I have to mention is the effects when the scene changes. Like the whole movie, they are stupid, but that's part of Jawbreaker's charm.If I had to recommend few songs from the soundtrack of Jawbreaker, I'd say Bad Word For A Good Thing by The Friggs and (Let the) Good Times Roll by The Cars. All the songs were well chosen and they worked. And some of the songs (especially the two mentioned) are like they could be straight from my music library. I love it when this happens while watching a movie.Jawbreaker is stupid but in a funny way.

The first three decide to play a joke on Liz by kidnapping her and in doing so they put a jawbreaker in her mouth to keep her from screaming. Unfortunately, she suffocates on it and dies. So the ringleader (Courtney) decides that they need to cover it up. While in the process of doing this the school loser, Fern Mayo (Judy Greer) happens to walk in at the wrong moment and so they decide to make her one of them in order to keep her quiet. Now, rather than detailing what happens next I will just say that things seem to take a life of their own after this. And while I thought it was entertaining at times, I wasn't impressed by the humor as much as I liked the unexpected course of events. As far as the acting was concerned, other than possibly Rebecca Gayheart nobody really stood out in my mind. In short, this was an average movie which some might like and some may not.

Many commenters have complained that Jawbreaker was very similar to Heathers (1988) but not as good. So what? If you want to see a film just like Heathers then go watch Heathers. Although generally panned by critics, Jawbreaker is nonetheless a cut above most 'high school' movies. The sound track fits the film better than is the case with most others of this genre. I particularly liked the use of Imperial Teen's Yoo Hoo, and the playing of Young at Heart during Courtney's (McGowan) meltdown. The use of such irony and cross reference is enough to show the makers are not taking it all too seriously, but not so much that the film becomes camp. I'm curious as to the geographic distribution of the negative vis-a- vis positive comments. My bet is that those who are more familiar with L.A. high school life had a better appreciation for Jawbreaker than might those living elsewhere.

The most powerful clique at Reagan High is four best friends(Rose McGowen, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz and Charlotte Ayanna) drawn together by their appreciation and devotion to each other. No doubt the most beautiful girls in the school and at the height of their popularity must deal with an unexpected situation ...an innocent birthday prank ends in the accidental death(choking on a jawbreaker) of one of them. Unfortunately their attempts at a cover up is overheard by the school nerd(Judy Greer)and her price for silence is to be made over with the chance to run with the hot chicks. Death totally bites and the devilish divas in heels will find it harder to keep their secret.Also in the castTatyana Ali, Jane Leigh Connelly, Carol Kane, Pam Grier, Jeff Conaway and William Katt.

It's sort of Heathers meets Cruel intentions meets Wild things meets the more recent Mean girls-punk style. This is one of those movies that I only rated a 6, because it isn't terribly original or well done, but will say I've seen several times and moderately enjoyed it , though I'm the first to admit this isn't exactly A great movie.For fans of these types of movies though, which I sometimes am, it isn't the worst choice one could make. The movie is dark, creepy, a bit campy and at times very interesting and it's got a great cast who, as a whole give the movie an energy it probably wouldn't have had with a less talented group.WARNING-SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POST Once you start watching Jawbreaker, your not likely to turn it off because you want to see how it ends. And what an ending! Though it rips off Cruel Intentions a bit, I loved the ending, I mean who wouldn't want to see Courtney get her due? I gotta give Rose Magowen credit, she plays the heck out of this part and succeeds in making Courtney an absolutely despicable, unlikeable villainess. All the characters were vivid and interesting, the subplot of Fern's transformation was both entertaining and a bit disturbing.Jawbreaker's ending has been criticized but I think it is pretty obvious that Courtney will go to jail. I liked the way the truth comes out, it was pretty creative and I loved watching Courtney's fall from grace at the prom.Jawbreaker isn't for everyone, it's dark, it's nasty, and a bit violent, but it doesn't take itself to seriously and it can be watched more then once, best to watch in a group. I happen to like movies about the dark side of trying to fit in and while Jawbreakers doesn't exactly break any new ground, if one is in the right mood, it's a fun hour and something minutes watching.

Jawbreaker is such a film. Part teen comedy, part murder story, and part cautionary tale, Jawbreaker is mostly garbage. It's another cheap attempt to recapture the rare chemistry between dark comedy and social satire that provided a perfect blend in 1989's cult classic Heathers, and it fails miserably. The plot of Jawbreaker revolves around three high school tarts who try to pull a cruel prank on their friend and end up murdering her instead. Everything beyond that is a clipshow of overdone teen scenarios assembled from hundreds of preceding self-labeled comedies that fail to deliver a single chuckle. But not only does Jawbreaker fail to provide any form of humor, it reaches that rare low-point that makes it truly painful to watch. This innocent girl's death is treated with such levity that the film tries to pass off shots of her cold, limp, and pale body as comic relief. After enduring the first twenty minutes of this train wreck I wanted to stop the film, burn the reels, decontaminate the ashes, and bury them at the bottom of a New Jersey sewer. There is not a single positive remark that can be made about it. The pacing -- or lack thereof -- is highly unbalanced, the performances are strenuous, the screenplay doesn't display any creative thought, and the editing made me feel as if the director had taken a pair of scissors and made random cuts in the work print (something I wouldn't mind doing to the final product). While viewing it I was reminded of something Mike Nelson said in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Just because you CAN edit, doesn't mean you SHOULD. No one -- not even a convicted serial killer -- deserves to undergo the grueling experience of watching this movie. I would almost be willing to travel back in time and prevent the invention of film in order that the reels of this stinkbomb never saw the light of day.

Heathers, is all about suicide.  Granted the suicides in Heathers are really murders in disguise but that brings up another point.  The murder in Jawbreaker is an accident.  In Heathers the murders are most definately intentional.  In Heathers the cast memebers are asked to do the following.  Do we believe that our seemingly happy, well adjusted popular teens are committing suicide or do we believe that one of our seemingly sad outcast unpopular teens is murdering the popular kids.  Because suicide in the 80's was seemingly trendy, the cast chooses to believe that perfectly normal kids are caught up in death because its trendy, instead of the more reasonable obvious approach.  So what does Jawbreaker ask?  Simple, how evil can popular kids be?  Whereas the conclusions reached in heathers is pretty off the wall.  Yet it explains quite simply the way the rest of the world (adults) view high school.  In Jawbreaker the conclusion is pretty evil.  We believe that they can be so bad that even the sweetest girl has a dark underbelly.  And truthfully that is how high school kids actually see themselves.  So where Heathers is about people on the inside looking out, Jawbreaker is people on the inside looking even deeper in. So next time you compare the two movies, sit down and watch them first.  You'll be suprised because strangely enough...they aren't even remotely similar.  In fact if I had to compare Jawbreaker to another film, it would have to be Carrie.  Which is why I'll have to agree with another imdb user and say that Jawbreaker verges on horror.

It was sharp and sassy with a well-chosen script and cast. The girls showed such powerful chemistry between them, I was in awe. Rose McGowan was priceless as the heartless, ring leader and Julie Benz (One of my favourite actresses) was loveable as the yappy side-kick. Rebecca Gayheart shone as the moralist Julie - I connected with her and grew to care what happened to her and how the story would unravel.I didn't care for 'Fern Mayo', not offense to the actress who played her, but I found the 'improved' Fern was nothing compared to the previous one. One scene, involving loud music and a bonnet of a shiny, red sports car, left me speechless. I had no idea what was going on!The cast suited their roles perfectly and I doubt other actresses could have played the popular crowd better. The script was cool, calm and witty and most pleasing to listen to.

This film is meant to take a certain amount of delight in the cruelty humans in different positions impose on one another simply to get ahead of where they are. The setting is High School. Statistically, it's impossible to complete 4 years of High School without being acquainted with someone who would go on to commit suicide. It's that sort of quality that makes High School the perfect place to document cruelty. Now, this movie may attempt to be cruel and fail in the eyes of critics (those who would say the film is just skilled in keeping the agenda mean and the vision particularly grotesque in it's obsession with beauty which makes it ugly).

I have no idea why the film didn't do too well, when it was released but all I can say is that it's brilliant and I'd recommend it to anyone. The cast in the film is perfect too. Rose McGowan is great Courtney Alice Shayne, who's a right b*tch but still popular and who even kills a member of her group, Liz Purr by gagging her with a Jawbreaker. Instead of owning up, she makes out that Liz was raped and tells her 'friends' Julie and Marcie, who were with her when this happened, that if they tell anyone, they will be finished. Rebecca Gayheart is also really great as Julie Freeman, a girl who soon realises that being popular is not so good and doesn't want anything do with Courtney, after she gagged Liz with a Jawbreaker so she leaves the group and becomes quite unpopular with everyone. Julie Benz is also really good as Marcie Fox, a popular girl who's a bit of a follower towards Courtney. Then, of course there's Judy Greer who's really good as Fern Mayo, a nerd who finds out what Courtney has done. Courtney tells Fern that if she doesn't tell anyone, she will make her popular. Fern doesn't know what to do at first, but then she agrees and she's turned in to a new popular girl with new make-over and a new name-Vylette.When Vylette soon realises her new popularity, she ends up turning into a b*tch just like Courtney. Courtney is not too happy about this and ends up exposing Vylette for the nerd she really is-Fern. Fern then realises how cruel Courtney is, so she and Julie make a plan to get Courtney back and make sure that everyone knows what really happened to Liz Purr, with a little help from Julie's new boyfriend Zak. When everyone finds out at the prom what really happened, Courtney is branded a killer and gets what is coming to her.  Anyway, Jawbreaker is absolutely brilliant and I give the film a 10/10  "},{"Title":"JAWBREAKER ROCKS HOW MUCH CLOSER CAN WE GET TO THE REAL THING","Date":"1 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  This movie is truly awesome i mean why wouldn't it be it has one of the hottest chicks around Rose McGowan (from scream & Monkey Bone) plus Rebecca Gayheart (from Urban Legend & Scream 2) not to mention Julie Benz from the hot series Roswell these three girls are sexy popular and they know how to have a fun time ........Courtney Alice Shane decides to have a little fun and kidnaps her best friend and accidently kills her jamming a JAWBREAKER  in her throat so she doesn't scream .....when they open up the car boot where they had shoved her in they found her dead with a JAWBREAKER in her throat they decided not to tell anyone and put her back in the bed and make it look like she's been raped 100% fun kick ass non stop action a+ i highly recommend it i enjoyed it so much me and my best friend have brought it thanks please watch it I'm sure you will enjoy it thank you imbd you ROCK JAWBREAKER JAWBREAKER JAWBREAKER JAWBREAKER JAWBREAKER JAWBREAKER  "},{"Title":"Awkward and Creative","Date":"26 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I never had any intentions or desires to see this when it was playing at the theaters a while back. To be honest, I can't even remember seeing the movie advertised. One night I recorded it by mistake, but I am really glad that I caught it at all. I was so impressed with the cast and the plot.We can all call this a pretty weird tale. The thing that captured my attention was that the most important part happened within the first three minutes. It didn't waste any time getting to the point and that is what I like in a movie. The plot is definitely out there, but that is what makes the movie so good. I enjoyed watching Rose McGowan play the evil Courtney because I don't hear too much about her. And boy can she play evil. Her role and character isn't too complicated, but enough so that we understand her thoroughly. I also liked how Rebecca Gayheart was included in the cast. Julie Benz, who I had never heard of, gives a good performance as well. All of the girls play the different parts with a lot of different directions that they are all good in their own ways. An excellent cast!While I very much liked the plot and cast, I disliked the stereotypical picture that was drawn for the characters and NOT the actors. I know that I am getting nitpicky here, but when I watch a movie, I like to see a real high school with real students in real wardrobes. This movie didn't have any of that. Also, a lot of characters were introduced to the audience that really didn't have an effect on the film. The script was also a little boring with very few comical or interesting situations. The writing was a no-brainer. Jawbreaker did have a lot of down falls, but it was good to see a movie with such a weird outline drawn. I'm a little disappointed that the film didn't do too well at the theaters. Maybe because it is different is what pushed most teenagers away.

"},{"Title":"A really weird movie, but it's great.","Date":"11 September 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  WARNING One could figure out the ending from my comments, even though I have not given it away. If you haven't seen the film, stop reading now.What a weird film!. It belongs to no specific genre, but is a mixture of drama, teen comedy, police-thriller, and horror genres. The film is a tongue-in-cheek, (almost) black comedy about three girls who try to conceal a murder, and the results of their deception.At first the film seemed like a typical movie for teens, about three girls who were the modern version of the Pink Ladies in Grease. (You know, the girls who rule the school.). But within the first few moments, you are in for a big surprise.One bit that bothered me was that the girls did not take enough care with the dead body.  When they took the body from the car and went up the stairs in Liz's house, Courtney and Julie were touching the dead girl's flesh with their bare hands. They only put gloves on when they handled the body in the bed. Then, after handling the body, Marcie and Courtney removed the gloves and proceeded to leave fingerprints all over the place. In reality, the police would have been able to catch them quite easily.One point in the film is open to interpretation. That is, did Courtney arrange for the man to have sex with the dead body? The obvious answer is no, and that Courtney had sex with the guy in the bed so that the man's semen would be left on the bed. However, the presence of the man's semen on the bed would only prove that he was there, and would be, at best, only very strong circumstantial for murder.I believe that Courtney wanted the police to believe Liz was raped. I base that on the following bit of dialogue that occurs when the three girls are in Liz's bedroom just after they prepare the bodyCourtney They'll see that she was raped. Julie         You can't just say she was raped because she's laying on the bed with her legs spread.I believe that Julie's comments made Courtney realize she had to make it look like Liz was really raped. And the only way to do this would be to have the man have sex with the dead body. If Courtney didn't do this, the police, because they use proper forensic procedures, would know the body wasn't raped. If there was no evidence of penetration or semen in the vagina, no one would think it was rape.In another scene, Courtney saysThey'll believe it because it's their worst nightmare. Elizabeth Purr, the very picture of teenage perfection, obliterated by perversion.Murder alone would be not be perverted enough for the appearance that Courtney was trying to achieve, but Liz being raped and murdered would be.In the scene where the man is shown humping, he is superimposed over an image of the dead body. This same technique of superimposition is used when Julie walks down the hall and passes a kneeling student. The director is playing with the nature of reality with this technique. Therefore, the fact that we do not directly see the man having sex with the body, does not mean he didn't. I believe the superimposition technique suggests a link between the humping man and the body, which could be interpreted that he is penetrating her.  Also, I think the director only suggested the rape because showing it in a more obvious manner would probably have been too much for the audience. (N.B. The fact that we see Courtney on top of the man proves that she had sex with him at some stage in the proceedings. It doesn't mean he didn't have sex with the dead body as well.)There was also a problem with the character Fern. When she found the girls out, they bribed her to keep quiet by letting her join their cool group. Fern was an A student and a person with character. She would not be the type of person to become an accomplice after the fact. A make-over would not be sufficient motivation for her to keep quiet.I loved the surrealistic scene where Julie was walking down the hall with the principal's voice in the background announcing the death of Marcia's friend. The others students are as still as statues, and one looks to be praying. There was no music. All you hear is the principal's voice and the clack-clack of Marcia's footsteps. The scene made me feel uneasy.Three brief scenes showing the girl's classes were brilliant. First, In Julie's English class, the topic was Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. (The play is about a man who suffered extreme guilt because he committed a murder.)We see Julie's reaction to the teacher discussing this guilt and we really understand how guilt is eating at Julie. The second scene was a very macabre one about human anatomy. The third scene, a home economics lesson, was also macabre.  The teacher had the students practice cracking open eggs. The students open their eggs and, when a Gothic student observes one of the eggs being opened, she points to it and says, Cool, you got a still born.All the male characters play a secondary role to the female characters. In one scene, the father can not stand up to his daughter. Also, the tough detective is female.The DVD is great. In the director's commentary, Darren Stein tells us why he made the film, he shares with us how the film Carrie influenced him, and he explains what he was thinking about when he directed particular scenes, His comments are especially enlightening considering he was not only the director, but also the writer.

That was an incredible turn-off right there.The movie was all down-hill from there.  There's no real ending, and though I won't reveal it, it was incredibly disappointing.  After everything that happens and everything Courtney does, you expect a bigger bang of an ending.  Plus, the acting is really, really bad.  Sorry, Ms. McGowen, but you weren't frightening at all.  And these people were supposed to be high schoolers?  'Julie' looked like late twenties at the least!   One comes away from this movie feeling very depressed.  After nearly 2 hours of awful acting, people lugging dead bodies around, and kinky sex (which isn't bad, as long as it's done right, which it certainly wasn't in this movie!

Rose McGowan, is a star on her way, as is Julie Benz and Rebecca Gayheart. All of them play rich high school snobs, except for Gayheart, who has a soft side. When they accidently kill one of their best friends, by stuffing a Jawbreaker into her mouth, for a surprise birthday bash, they all decide not to tell the police. But there's one thing, the school dork, Fern, catches them in the act. To keep Fern quiet, they re-make her, into one of them, and also re-name her, Vylette. I, on the other hand, was not impressed by Fern/Vylette. After they adopt her, Vylette seems to be taking on their snotty characteristics, and soon Rebecca is knocked out of the picture. Too make a long story short, if you like to see snobby high school girls, like Rose McGowan in this movie, and you like to see them get what they deserve, Jawbreaker is the film for you. And remember, if you've seen Heathers, there might be a couple similarities, but don't let that stop you from watching this great film!

There are a few fun moments overall, but this movie doesn't really have a plot, and it just drags on for about an hour and a half, trying to make itself just remotely worthwhile by filling the story was acrid dialogue, trashy and shallow characters, and a lot of loud music. The first 20 minutes start off pretty unpleasantly, we get to see a kidnapping, a pale-white corpse with the shape of a jawbreaker bulging out of her throat, and 3 friends (Rose McGowan, Julie Benz and Rebecca Gayheart) ripping off the body's panties so it looks like she was raped. Rose McGowan gives a pretty good performance as the evil satan in heels, but her character soon grows tiresome, and practically forces the viewer to hate her. The entire movie has surprisingly few laughs, it's like a Heathers without the satiric humour and cleverness. Strangely, this movie does borrow a lot from the cult classic, especially with the Winona Ryder character, who is clearly transfered into a blander, witless Rebecca Gayheart. One of the worst parts of Jawbreaker was it's wasting of Pam Greir, who's character was practically a background ornament with no effect on plot. The movie starts to get pretty dull till the end, and doesn't offer much until the climax arrives, which was a pretty lame attempt at re-creating the Carrie prom humiliation.

While practically every post-80's teen film is a descendant of the John Hughes sap-fest The Breakfast Club, there was never a big rush to come out with Heathers clones.  Though it gave us one of the first in-depth inside looks at the popular crowd, it also tackled the taboo of suicide.  Perhaps this is why its influence has been more subtle than mere cloning.While Heathers, one of the best teen films ever made, never gets beneath the surface and really examines the dark side of high school, at least it tried, which is more than I can say for Jawbreakers.This is a film that is a direct descendant from the aforementioned dark comedy, even borrowing exact shots from Heathers.  It's a 90's version, which here, essentially equates to being darker.Indeed, Jawbreaker is so politically incorrect (like the quip about the Karen Carpenter table) and so outrageous, it is in some ways darker than its predecessor.  However, there's no depth or purpose behind all the cruelty, other than mining laughs and upping the shock factor.  Most of all, there is hardly any wit, and even less actual humor, which was what helped made Heathers such a comic delight.If there's any redemption here, it's found in the form of Rose McGowan whose cruelty is often jaw-dropping.  She seems to be having a lot of fun here, despite the fact that she and everyone else in the cast, really aren't given much to do.

Seriously, Rose McGowan tried, but couldn't carry the movie. Her voice is so bitchy and bratty it got annoying. One good thing about her is she is built like a real woman with hips instead of the usual anorexic standard for actresses these days. Kind of like the feminine ideal from the 50's, except all the raunchy tattoos kind of ruin that effect. The cameo by her boyfriend, Mr. Manson, was kind of amusing. But the movie seemed like they were making it up as they went along, and very predictable. Terrible script, and your believability is stretched way too far. After Courtney (McGowan) and her clique kidnap one of their pals, things go awry and she (the pal) ends up dead. They drive around, freaking out, all except for Courtney, who has the brilliant plan to call the high school, pretend to be the dead pal's mom, and call in sick for her. OK, what is one of the first things the police would ask the kid's mom after she turned up dead? Sheeeesh. Rebecca Gayheart's acting is slowly improving. I give this movie two stars, one for Pam Grier, one for the sheer mean-spiritedness and bad taste of it. But that's not enough to save this dog of a movie, and the jailbait band The Donnas weren't enough to save it either. Oh, and I liked the Donnas better the first time I heard them, when they were called The Ramonas and The Runaways. I wouldn't bother, unless you are a big Rose McGowan fan.

She seems to only have two acting faces, I'm a bitch and I'm a mean bitch. Even if this woman was given a role as a Russian immigrant with AIDS and her dying wish was to ride a buffalo across Utah, she would still have a Gucci purse containing cherry red lipstick, and say lines like Nobody fu*** with Brittany! Sadly, McGowan is the least of this movie's problems. A confused, uninspired high school black comedy that plays by a million rules we have seen before in better pictures. Filmed with shocking ineptitude, the film careers along up to its - I guess - resolution. Non-talents like Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz, and newcomer Judy Greer fill the cast, giving performances that will prevent them from ever attaining anything more than what Aaron Spelling doles out to them. The soundtrack - probably the only thing in this film that was arranged with care - is wonderful. There are some great songs here. But the music is handled like 70% of other movies, in a way that blatantly suggests Hey kids, this is $14.99 at Sam Goody!, instead of righteous cues and appropriate placement. And 20 licks from the bullwhip for whomever decided to mangle Volcano Girls by Veruca Salt for the opening credit sequence. Since the director is clueless, Pam Grier and Marilyn Manson are wasted in two small roles. Those are definitely two people who would be intriguing to watch more on the big screen.

But I approached it on its own terms, and proceeded to try to fit the characters into various contexts, e.g., on a linear scale of vaunted coolness. I sort of expected them to pull off at least some kind of trenchant plot fillip. But, in the end, the film falls prey to the simple fact that the parties involved didn't really have a strong enough narrative drive. Like I said, it provided fodder for some kind of real resolution, but (as they say) the hardest part of a chess game is the end-game. The same is true for a flick that establishes tension based on genuinely high-stakes circumstances (mild spoiler murder).

But then again this is set in an American high compared to something in Australia. A different type of social politics, I guess. Anyhow, I read that the flick took four weeks to shoot and originally the director intended the film to be a horror film, but it went into black comedy territory instead. To say it was a good one would be a bit of a stretch. Because it wasn't that funny, nor particularly compelling. I love my black comedies, but this failed miserably after the somewhat promising opening. For me, it was just another superficial teen flick that's masquerading as an edgy black comedy. It was more glossy, and sweet on the outside, but the context of this one-idea film was plain sour. Trashy indeed, but the whole irony just didn't come off. Yeah, its hardly awful to say the least, but the intended parody gimmick just didn't succeed, by working it into the usual formula, misplaced sentiment and high school clich√©s. Overall, the plot is just unconvincing and tame in the way it plays out. And for the climax, well actually it was better than expected. What went by the wayside were the smug characters, sure they're mockery performances&#133; I hope so, but they were hard to connect with, even the ones with good intentions. Nothing interesting really about these characters that's for sure. Although, the performances run cold and hot. A bubbling Rose McGowan stood out as the ice queen of the group, plus there are some small roles from the likes of Carol Kane, PJ Soles, William Katt and Pam Grier as a tough police detective. Onto the cold, well Rebecca Gayheart as one of the leads and was rather uneventful. The dialogue rather snappy material, but other times it bordered on glamorous drivel. Indeed, it was mocking the way those stuck up snobs acted, but at times I was hoping for some more wit, or inventive humour instead. It's been done to death before. Since I'm on the negatives, uh how uncool was that editing? What was the deal with those ridiculous cartoon sound effects, especially during the editing sequences? Now what was good was that of the rocking soundtrack that pumped out some great tunes. Somehow I found it more spiritless even with it sugar, glossy approach. Now if only we could've seen the horror take that it was first going to be, gee I wonder what we would have got? From what I read it sounds like a wannabe Heathers, a film that I haven't watched, but should do so from what I read and heard of it. The film runs for just under 80 minutes, which gladly it did because my interested was dipping in and out within that time.

She is easily the best thing in Jawbreaker, a ruthless teen queen bee who manipulates everyone around her. The problem is the movie around her. The setup is promising three teen princesses joke-kidnap their friend on her birthday, but accidentally kill her. The girls plan to cover it up, but a wallflower who admires the dead girl discovers what happened. Courtney (McGowan) bribes the wallflower into silence by promising to make her popular. So far, so good. However, what comes after suffers from a lack of focus. The protagonist could have been the wallflower, the shunned former princess, or Courtney as an anti-hero. If the writers had made Courtney the protagonist, letting the audience vicariously delight in her bitchiness, that would have made a sharp little character study. As it is, we don't know who to follow.Spoilers ahead The other big problem is that the ending goes limp. The logical question raised by Courtney's character is how far will she go? Would she kill to get what she wants? A second killing (even if only threatened) would have made the stakes matter. Instead, the film tries to equate literal death with high school social death, and being pelted with corsages is just not enough after accidentally killing somebody. This movie (under eighty minutes) actually could have been longer going into the other characters more, giving Pam Grier more to do as a detective, and cranking up the tension at the ending.

Jawbreakers is a film (and I use that term loosely) that appears to have been made by a group of kids attempting to make their own version of teen hits.  Not a better version mind you, or a different version; it seems their attempt was to just make the same version (or combination therof) that they have already seen on the video shelves.  Even such a low goal was not met.  The film is bad. This film is not in the so bad it's funny range (if only it were), it's in the so bad it's embarrassing range.  The acting is bad.  The script is bad.  Or is the film completely improvised?  It's tough to tell.  The direction is non-existent.  The production design, though very unoriginal would be the highlight just because it's not as bad.  The concept is copied from Heathers, endless Friday the 13th parodies of the 1980's and an old Saturday Night Live sketch (one of those that end up AFTER the news update and are cut from the syndicated re-runs and featuring someone who is currently dead) all performed by your local high-school theatrical class--you know one of those performances only a parent would buy a ticket to but worth getting out of Algebra class for.)  Walking out of the theater after watching this film makes you feel like a dope for being there and embarrassed if anyone sees you.

Now Jawbreaker is a simple idea that anyone could think of. The characters are all the same and yet differently. Courtney is a teen witch who cares about herself and so do her friends but they all care differently about themselves and other people like parents or guys. But Jawbreaker is really weak. The opening scene where they find they're friend Liz with the candy in her throat will make you feel like you want to throw up, from ripping the tape off of her mouth to see her mouth empty is just gross. The plot is lame, simple as that. The characters as I have said are all the same, girls are like the other girls and that goes for the same as the guys only with they're personalities tweaked a bit to be a new character. Also Marolyn Manson is in this, weird. I didn't see him, I must of blinked. While Jawbreak tries to be a smart little dark comedy it fails in everything it brings. Jawbreaker dishes out a low 2.

Spoilers Cournety's voice is amplified over the intercom during the school's prom revealing she killed Liz and to deal with it. So what does the crowd of angry prom goers do? They pelt her with flowers and boo at her. No jail or police men waiting for her, yawn. Not recommended for anything except for some flashy backgrounds, that's all.

I have seen Carrie and found that film reasonable, if overrated. This film alludes to the said Carrie at one point, and there are similarities; namely with the clique of girls at odds with another girl, though that changes round due to early events.Jawbreaker isn't quite run-of-the-mill, though its character development definitely is. The idea isn't novel, but that isn't to say it can't succeed if the film differs in other ways.  The characters, I hear you ask? Obviously they're all rather well-worn stereotypes. That wouldn't be so much a problem if the film was consistently witty and enjoyable. But, this film undeniably has its longueurs, even with it clocking it at barely eighty minutes. Most glaring is the time wasted with the relationship between Julie and some non-entity who's supposed to be a player.Of the main characters, Rose McGowan's minx, Courtney Alice Shayne, makes the most impression. She proves adept at chewing the scenery, over-playing the prima-bitch role to a degree that amuses. She's quite the card. Plus, of course, she's got the sulky, petulant good looks and pouts on tap. It is clearly a problem that no-one else really makes much of an impression in the film. Rebecca Gayheart is certainly very striking in her looks, and acts passably. Shame it's a boring role. Shame that given Julie's falling out with Courtney, there is only one scene amounting to a bitchy confrontation between them, and it is indeed funny - Courtney - Life'a bitch, then you die; Julie - No, honey. *you're the bitch.*; Courtney - Ooh, so aggressive! It's turning me on...! et al.  Julie Benz really has remarkably little to do or say for a lead, ending up as a mere minion of McGowan. I can't say there was anything much in Judy Greer's character or peformance as either the scant, laughable stereotype Fern or the vapid pretender, Vylette. Pam Grier is in for little reason, other than as a star name, it seems. Manson? Didn't see the feller. A minor point, but certainly noticeable, would be the fact that these supposed high-school dames are played by actresses pushing mid-late twenties in age.The script contains some good dialogue, and also lines that are rather good in an absurd, silly way - It's just weird how time erases things./Time doesn't erase things, people erase things/Yeah, people erase people...; this last line is delivered amusingly by Gayheart, I must admit. The soundtrack? A compendium of soft-metal, neo-rock tracks, largely indistinguishable from each other. The use of Young at Heart, sung by Bing Crosby, at the end, is odd and all the better for it. This final scene is okay, if more than predictable. It's a shame no real spin is put on it, barring a sheen of irony and semi-grand guignol. The film's central problem seems to be one of tone. Playing flippant with such potentially dark subject matter is quite a risk and if not done well enough, the film will falter. But then, the best things about this are the few choice lines and the exaggerated over-playing. Maybe a more fully light-hearted tale would have been a better bet.  Anyway, the film truly is small-fry, and while it could have been much worse, it is largely a failed exercise in trying to do a cool black comedy. Insufficient in many areas, bitchiness quota perhaps included, on reflection.Rating- ** 1/2/***** "},{"Title":"thank you jawbreaker!","Date":"20 May 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I was just looking through my voting record and realized that I have an inordinant amount of high scores.

The girl to their surprise chokes to death.They cover the crime and stage a rape and murder.

Jawbreaker contains one of the most original idea's I have ever seen; using a piece of candy as a murder weapon-too bad it's a very, very bad idea. So bad that this is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies of the year.The Jawbreaker opening sequence has a trio of teens kidnapping their best friend, the prom queen Julie, on her seventeenth birthday for a surprise. They tie her up, snatch her from her own bed, force a massive jawbreaker into her startled mouth to keep her quiet, and shove her in their car trunk.When the three, Courtney the leader, Julie and Marcie, open the truck to surprise Julie, but  they are the ones who receive the surprise. For our prom queen has suffocated on that jawbreaker shoved in her mouth and died while on her way to her own surprise party. What to do now?Of course, the trio follows the brilliant idea coming from their leader. Courtney decides that instead of reporting the accidental death of their best friend to the police, that they should cover it up. They take Julie back to her house and make it look like she was raped and killed the night before hand. But wait. There is a witness. What next? Make her an offer Fern Mayo, the witness, will keep her mouth shut in return to have the honor to take the place of Julie and become a member of their clique, complete with an identity change and full body makeover. How could she resist.While the film stars out with what seems as a standard three act structure, after the initial problem is solved, it loses track of what the subject was, and thus opens a brand new series of evens, unrelated to anything proceeding it. Thus it wastes time during most of the second  act The four girls, whom we never did care about, must deal with their changing feelings, boyfriend relationships, and their fading friendship, which doesn't even come close to working. What does that have to do with an accidental murder cover-up? This is why there's zero tension in the plotline.And how about those characters, who look well into their mid 20's, but yet play high schoolers. They are developed with snapshots while the opening credits role by and are way too obvious, especially the shy Fern Mayo. There is no chemistry between the friends, nor is there a convincing reason why they do what they do. The romance is flat and put-on. The comedic dialogue is dark and disturbing, not funny.Along with the structure, dialogue, and characters, the acting is also quite bad. Rose McGowan from Phantoms is great; she is devilishly evil and sinister, just what her character needs. Too bad Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz and Judy Greer can't do the same. They come off as partially stupid, slow, or both. There is nothing for Pam Grier or Carol Kane to do here. And that brief appearance by Marilyn Manson-boy, what a surprise it is to see him as a bar hoping rapist.The movie is filled with all sorts of glamour, style, and audacity, all which are noteworthy. The film had a certain boldness to it. It tried for a sex scene between a muscular jock and Courtney, which is so desperate it consists of  some bizarre and head turning dialogue, a popsicle that they both enjoy, and an interruption by the cops. What arousal there. It clearly tired to be as sexy and last years Wild Things but was so desperate I couldn't stop laughing during the sequence.The ridiculous ending to Jawbreaker of course, as many other teen flicks, consisted of a built up prom in which all the good are rewarded, the bad are humiliated but not necessarily punished, and a series of flat smiles and soundtracks that will make you want to puke. I said it before and I'll say it again Jawbreaker is one of the years worst films.

Nope ... just a weed.","Date":"23 January 2001","Score":"11 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  `Jawbreaker' is an obvious aspirant to the mantle of the legendary `Heathers' - one of the smartest, sassiest, and sharpest teen movies ever made. An ostensibly similar plot sees the most popular - and most spiteful - clique at school accidentally murder their classmate. The school nerd is their only witness. In return for her silence, they agree to make her over in their image, tempting her with the promise of popularity. Unfortunately, `Jawbreaker' lacks everything that made `Heathers' great. As a `Clueless on Crack' it fares a little better - but, given the intriguing possibilities of its concept, is still a disappointment.Where the earlier movie was intelligently malevolent, `Jawbreaker' is a surprisingly mean-spirited film. Its characters never rise above caricatures, making them difficult to empathise with. The journey of Fern `Mayonnaise' Mayo from school nerd the babelicious Vylette is hollow and unconvincing. Unlike Veronica Sawyer of `Heathers' who undergoes a similar transformation, Vylette seems to gain precious little wisdom from her experiences. Perhaps this has to do with the nails-on-a-blackboard performance of Judy Greer, who seems to believe she is in a John Waters film. This would be fine, if `Jawbreaker' could decide whether it is one or not.A lazy and sometimes implausible script hanging uneasily between reality, satire, and surrealism offers some clever one liners and sequences, but does little to showcase the talents occasionally on offer. Rose McGowan is the most enjoyable thing about the film for the simple reason that it's clear she isn't taking proceedings too seriously. Rebecca Gayheart's performance is also refreshing; a puddle of reality within the screeching teen-stereotype world around her which throws Judy Greer's Fern/Vylette into even higher relief. Both act as if they are in a better film.Perhaps the real difference between the two is that `Heathers' had heart and actual insight. `Jawbreaker's heart is as hollow as the view it espouses it's bad to murder your friend, but it's worse to be a b*tch.

I guess if i watched Charmed, I would know her, but Death Proof was my introduction. I thought she was so cool, and she was in this film also. It may have been a campy film about high school, but she was just so interesting.I remember Carole Kane from Taxi - boy, does that date me! I always like to see her pop up and she did a great job in this film also.Pam Grier played a police detective and I always like seeing her. I'll be checking her out next in Bones.It's a forgettable film, but it was funny and worth watching just to see some of the cast.

However, if anyone wants to watch a movie that at least pretends to make sense, then this is not the one. Stupidity from the beginning to end, and not that that's a bad thing. But it somehow offends that the producers or directors or screenwriters tried to pass off several parts of the movie when anyone with half a brain could have realized that - not going to spoil. But, after watching, you are plagued with, 'but that wasn't at all realistic, they made those people stupid, that couldn't have happened, duh' and eventually the conclusion is, watching that movie was an unbelievable waste of time.

The dark comedy is at times hampered by a script and plot line that cripples any kind of suspension of disbelief, and McGowen's stilted performance is annoying. Its not a REAL bad movie, but worse than Heathers which had dark HUMOR as well as better acting. Lines like I love mah dead gay son make it heads and shoulders above Jawbreaker. It IS a good movie for the slacker set, one that is exagerrated angst with an MTV vulgarity.

It's either a bad homage or straight out rip-off of the film Heathers, which is worlds better than this, plus it features Rose McGowen reprising that same role she does in just about every film she's in heartless bitch that never shows any emotions (the only other character she ever portrays is ditzy girl that never shows any emotions.  She has range...).  Plus, as if the lame script, thin satire and horrible acting wasn't enough - you get to see Rose and her real life boyfriend, Marilyn Manson, have sex.  It's charming.Yes, High School sucks, but so does this movie.  Two wrongs don't make a right. "}]
