There are many reasons to it, but I think what makes it so special is it's sense of style. It proves effectively that a gritty street-drama doesn't have to look bad in order to be realistic. Instead of using hand held cams and grainy film the Hughes' shoot their film with style, influenced by John Woo, and action-comics.The violence used is also excessive and very graphic. There are brutal beatings as well as bloody shootings, all shot much better than your average action-movie. Like as in Dead Presidents, the directors aren't afraid of over-doing anything. Through slow-motion and impressive camera manoeuvering they're making great, exhilarating action.Well, besides the violence the movie is great in many other ways. The shootings and bloodlettings are just to make it more realistic, which is pretty much the goal of the movie. In heartbreaking detail the main characters narrate us through youth criminality, drug-dealing, racism and a lot of other nasty stuff. The voice-over works really well, making Menace a sort of black Goodfellas.The story is great, in some points resembling some greek tragedy, with a storyline used successfully in other movies like Carlito's Way, Goodfellas, American History X and many others. It's about changing your life in time, before it's too late. If you don't change in time, all your past sins will come back to you. The movie is hilarious, sad, suspenseful and very educational for those who think there is racial equality in USA.The Hughes' are young, aggressive and  untouchable film-makers who intend to show you the real world, and do it with style.

It tells the story of young Caine Lawson, a teen growing up in Watts, California. The opening briefly shows Caine getting caught up in a grocery store shooting with his friend. This was a chilling way to open the movie, as it shows how easy it is for someone in the ghetto to get caught up in the moment and kill someone. During the opening credits, we see footage of the Watts riots that took place during the 60's. Caine narrates the story of his life, explaining how after the riots, drugs came into effect, and affected his home life as a child. After loosing his parents on at the hands of drugs, he was sent to live with his Grandparents. His Grandparents love him, but they struggled to raise him and tried their hardest to keep him out of trouble. Not too long into the movie, after we learn about Caine's early life, we see him graduate from High School. He hopes to leave the life of violence that surrounds him in his neighborhood. After falling victim to a violent car jacking, he is brought into violence and crime himself. As the story progresses, and things spiral downward for Caine, he ends up in a hell of a jam and tries to make a way out of it all. This is an incredible movie. It perfectly balances the ugly crime life and murder of tough inner city neighborhoods, Caine's own personal troubles, police brutality, and drugs. This is a powerful movie with a great story. It has a good message, but in some ways, I thought the film Boyz N the Hood showed the message in a better way. Menace II Society is more focused on the crime involved in inner cities, where as Boyz N the Hood focuses more on the family life of the characters. This is an excellent film that you should see if you ever get the chance. It has a good message, and it has some very moving moments in it. If you enjoyed this, I also recommend Boyz N the Hood, and you'll probably enjoy the Wayans brothers' spoof, Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.

This is true but it was too preachy in the execution of its main themes.  Director John Singleton has never matched it (and probably never will) but has come close with such hard-hitting films as Higher Learning, Rosewood, Shaft and Baby Boy.  Don't get me wrong, I love Boyz and I know that Singleton is one of the finest African-American directors in Hollywood, it is just that I cannot get past the tiring preachiness that has become common in his films.Now, you do not see that with the Hughes Brothers.  They portray their films in a much more realistic fashion.  One thing that has become a main criticism with the Hughes Brothers, is how they portray violence in their films.  How else can you show violence in a movie without it looking completely fake?  Just look at anything they've done and you notice how frighteningly realistic their subject matter is.  Yes in this film, people are shot, beaten, and robbed, but it is done a brutal fashion that is realistic.  If you've seen any music video or film that they have directed, you can easily make the claim that they are the best at what they do - portraying life as for what it is.  First look at Menace II Society.  This film upon its release in 1993, was instantly compared to Boyz N the Hood.  What separated the two, was their subject matter.  Boyz focused on the positive side of living in the Los Angeles ghetto, which was South Central if I'm not mistaking.  It also showed us Tre (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who tries to survive, despite his harsh surroundings.  He grows up with a caring father (Laurence Fishburne) and it also shows him with his friends, many of whom are doomed to the legacy of street violence.  Menace shows us the other, darker side of that picture.  The story focuses on Caine (brilliantly played by Tyrin Turner) and his life after graduating from high school.  It goes without saying that Caine is a criminal, but we come to sympathize with him, even though there is no way we can support his actions.  He's a product of drug-pushing/using parents, witnessed murder before he was ten, was orphaned sometime later, and is now living with his God-fearing grandparents.  Throughout the film, Caine and O-Dog (Larenz Tate) commit numerous crimes.  You may think that the Hughes Brothers are glorifying that criminal image, but in fact, they are condemning it.  If they were glorifying Caine and O-Dog's actions, then the Brothers would not show us the consequences of those actions.      Now look at their music videos.  I cannot describe any 2Pac videos because I haven't seen any, but I can describe the Korn videos, both Here To Stay and Thoughtless.  Now before I go into this, I'll say that I'm a huge fan of rap, but I also enjoy some metal, Korn being the biggest thing metal I listen to.  At first I wondered why the Hughes Brothers would direct music videos for a band like Korn, and then I listened to songs on their newest CD, titled Untouchables.  Right there on the first track I realized the connection between Korn and the Hughes Brothers - the Brothers trademark of naturalness of everyday life combined with Jonathan Davis' angst-filled and sometimes violent lyrics, which often describe his childhood in school.  In Korn's Here To Stay video, we are shown the band (Davis, Brian Welch, James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu and David Silveria), silhouetted against a huge snowing television screen.  Throughout the video, images of the band are intercut with footage of the Gulf War, C-sections being performed, the L.A. riots, the 1986 Challenger explosion, police chases, animals attacking other animals, and at one point during the video, we are shown a police a car with the numbers 666 on the roof.  As a grand finale, we are shown a twelve year-old boy sucked into the television screen after coming into contact with it.  The relevance here is not the band itself, but the Hughes Brothers direction.  The end shows how images of violence and destruction in the news affect our youth, just like in Menace II Society with Caine, who was young and was exposed to the same conditions as the boy in the video.In Korn's Thoughtless video, we're shown a seventeen year-old boy who gets revenge on his classmates by showing up at prom with a hooker for a date and ends with him vomiting all over his classmates, while his hooker girlfriend is laughing the entire time.  Again, the Brothers are showing us violence in youth, but doesn't show us the consequences of the boy's actions.  He wanted revenge, he got it, but is he truly satisfied?  The connection with the Brothers here is like in Menace, showing that there is always consequences and you most likely will suffer.  In the case of the boy, he will most likely end up warped and needing psychiatric help. The Hughes Brothers have come under heavy scrutiny for just about everything they've ever worked on.  This is largely because as I've already stated that their work is often very grim, but people often miss the fact that their work is often very optimistic about everything they talk about.  Caine could have moved to Atlanta, the boy in the Here To Stay video could have simply turned off the television, and the boy in Thoughtless could have put everything behind him and start over.As an African-American person myself from Virginia and living in a middle-class neighborhood no where near any of the areas I've described, I can't say for sure how accurate these films are (nor the music videos), but I can say that the Hughes Brothers, John Singleton and Korn truly bring out a glimpse of what life can be for some people.

The Hughes Brother's movie charts the hapless life of Caine (Tyrin Turner) as he seeks to escape the ghetto. The son of both a drug dealer (Samuel L. Jackson in a potent appearance) and an addict, Tyrin, surrounded by guns and a machismo culture, is tied to his friends and the way of life afforded him. Even as love and a chance of a way out arises with Jada Pinkett's (terrific) pretty Ronnie, it's doubtful if Tyrin will escape from the revolving door of death.Menace II Society had a troubled beginning, refused a video certificate on the grounds of its profane language and brutally violent scenes, it has since gone on to be viewed as one of the finer exponents of anti-violence involving Black Americans. That wasn't always the case though, many critics in the 90s were prone to calling it a film that glamorises the lifestyle of Hood gangsters, but offered a saver of sorts by correctly saying it had realism in amongst the harshness. Certainly the dialogue and regional slang was refreshing to hear, thus affording Menace and its makers praise for keeping it real, so to speak.Ineviatbly comparisons were (are) drawn with John Singleton's 1991 film, Boyz n the Hood. But although Menace is rawer, uncompromising and more visceral with impact, it lacks the intelligence of Singleton's film. Where Boyz had fully rounded characters, character with which to hang your hat on to, Menace is just a social group of youths we neither know or care about outside of the group, ego driven dynamic. When lead protagonist Tyrin is trying to deal with his inner conflict, we the audience are treated to standard run of the mill melodrama. The streetwise edginess that the Hughes' began their film with (the opening is nigh on horrific) has long since gone as they try to make a film that touches all the bases of Black Americana.Easily the most realistic of all the ghetto films made, in fact the film at times feels like we are on a documentary drive around downtown Watts. Menace II Society, however brutal it clearly is, has loaded the gun and shot the bullet, only to see it narrowly miss the whole target it was aiming for.

Both films purport to be serious examinations of the trials and tribulations of post-Vietnam African Americans, but in reality function more as giant exploitation films. The influence here is Scorsese's Goodfellas, which the young Hughes brothers &#x96; the perfect age to be seduced by Scorsese's pyrotechnics - attempt to mimic blow for blow. And like Scorsese's film, though absent of his considerable style, the Hughes' work here is thin, melodramatic and sensationalistic, with deaths, screams, headshots, bombast, snorting, swearing and fury schematically rolled out to shock, bludgeon and titillate rather than edify. An entire resurgence in African American film-making would be corrupted in the early 1990s with such films.This is how it really was, the brothers would claim in interviews, positing their early films as a response to John Singleton's (underrated) Boyz n the Hood. Their films, the brothers claimed, portrayed the reality behind Singleton's supposedly rosy portrayal of the African American experience. But time has been unkind to their pictures. And as the baseline for what constitutes realism constantly moves, today Dead Presidents and Menace to Society, once touted as being a form of black neorealism or black naturalism, seem hilariously overcooked and gratuitous. And as with all these films, there is little understanding of why our cast of African Americans do what they do, behave how they behave or examination of the power structures and psycho-socio-economic forces at work. (Both films essentially boil down to blacks killing for money; but economics is itself the cause of the problem, stretching all the way from Vietnam to the Slave Trade to the Roman Empire) Still, there are good moments scattered about. Menace to Society opens with its best scene, an impromptu robbery/massacre in which a couple of black kids shockingly gun down the Asian shop-workers who insulted them. If disrespect is the root of all violence, we see that here, the larger marginalization of, or systemic disrespect toward, African Americans breeding both feelings of unworthiness and its opposite, a kind of manic need to protect, sometimes violently, brutalized egos. Black culture may have been mocked in the 90s for its bling, its hysterical materialism, but this, as well as the numerous riots which rocketed across the US in the early 90s, was an understandable response to both widespread feelings of neglect and a culture with conflates wealth and worth. One should not have to prove one's humanity, one's worthiness, and when one is constantly forced to do so, pressure builds and one sometimes snaps. What's pertinent about Menace's snaps is that the victim's of such black aggression are always minorities or other blacks. Meanwhile, white faces are absent from the picture. Society functions in a similar way, Power deflecting hate away from itself &#x96; down the social hierarchy - and onto others. Unfortunately the rest of the picture degenerates into gratuitous gore and violence.Better than Menace is Dead Presidents, which opens in 1968 and attempts to charter the lives of three friends (played by Larenz Tate, Chris Tucker, and Freddy Rodriguez) from the Bronx. They fight in Vietnam, are abandoned by the state, struggle to make a living, battle addiction and are then drawn to a life of crime.Like Menance, Presidents at time shows traces of political savvy &#x96; one of the guards killed during the robbery is himself a Vietnam vet - but sensationalism, cynically employed shocks and thriller set pieces eventually undermine claims to earnestness. Blame Scorsese for this. Singleton's Boyz n the Hood was released before Goodfellas and so is stylistically somewhat different from most African American films of the period.5/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

In Menace II Society there *is* none. Or maybe the actors or the direction could have saved it, but nothing, and I mean nothing, can overshadow the storyline. It's absolutely dreadful.The film centers on the milestones and many idiotic mistakes of Caine, the main character who lives in a predominantly black area that unfortunately is inhabited by equally morally deprived residents. If you haven't guessed what his fate is from the very beginning, he ends up getting shot, deserving every bullet that penetrates his body. Seriously. Caine, his friend, and nearly all the people in his 'hood minus the little children and Ronnie appear to have no morals whatsoever. They are all caught in a vacuum of moral depravity. Because of this, Caine continuously takes every golden chance to improve his life and throws it away until he finally gets what was coming in the end. Being arrested and even having a baby has done nothing to make him step back and think before he finds himself throwing swings and making yet another fatal action. Because he and many of the characters are so corrupted, there is absolutely no sympathy radiating from me.The film is not in any way powerful. Maybe in a bizarre world where the more violence there is in a film, the better the message comes across. If you look past the scenes that are supposed to have a strong message (for instance, the end where Caine is shot at least eight times), you realize that this boy had EVERY bullet coming! I don't believe it takes that many mistakes to realize that one has to clean up his act. The story had some potential, but if the writers injected just a bit of morality into the main character, and directed him so that he was more of a dynamic character, then I would have had sympathy for him. Halfway through the film, there's no other action to take but to throw in the towel on Caine; the boy will never learn.I decided to review this years after it was released, after various attempts to appreciate this film for its critical acclaim and its attempt to show that throwing away every chance life gives you is deadly. After years of trying to see what made this film so popular, I still don't know why some people even put it a mark above Boyz N The Hood. I still say that the graphic violence, which appears almost glamorized in this film, tricked people into thinking Menace was up a notch from Boyz.I stand by my opinion, this is an overrated dud.

All of those elements make Menace II Society a great Hood movie,one of the best films of the 1990s and The Hughes Brothers at their best.Set in the South Central Los Angeles section of Watts,California,Menace II Society tells the story of Caine(Tyrin Turner),a street hustler who has just recently graduated from High School and is on the streets. Now,Caine is trying to survive on the streets of Watts either by starting a new life on the positive side or become a victim of the streets.Menace II Society is a brilliant and unforgettable Hood movie classic that came out two years after John Singleton's landmark Hood classic Boyz N The Hood(1991)and if Boyz N The Hood is The Godfather of Hood Movies,then Menace II Society would be the Goodfellas(a film that The Hughes Brothers used as a template)of the Hood genre. Right from it's shocking and disturbing opening scene,Menace II Society is a film that pulls you into a dark,urban nightmare that pulls no punches and is a movie that offers no salvation or safe keeping. Despite the tragedy and sadness that was in Boyz N The Hood you felt that there was hope at the end,but in Menace II Society there is no hope or happiness and you will feel that nothing will be good for the characters. Where as Boyz N The Hood focused on a couple of good kids trying to survive in their neighborhood,Menace II Society gives viewers an unflinching look into the world of Watts,California showing world where most of the main characters are criminals and despite being surrounded by urban decay, violence and death don't seem to be bothered by it but embellish it because it is a way of life in the characters eyes and with some of the characters there is no other way. The carelessness and apathy of the some of the characters gives MIIS a nihilistic outlook that is bleak and at times reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange(1971)and Tim Hunter's River's Edge(1987)two other films that also have a bleak overtone. What is also great about MIIS is the style of the movie is almost like a Film Noir whether's Caine's narration or the dark lighting that is in the background that makes the movie realistic and at the same time surreal and dream like. The violence in MIIS is shocking and very brutal with nothing being toned down for the viewers showing how violence is shocking and horrific and when the violence happens it will disturb viewers mentally and physically with it's intensity and power. The violence in MIIS is not meant to be fun or exciting but to send a message that violence keeps happening and it's an on going cycle in the hood and ghetto and the violence also sends a message that the things that you do can come back to bite you in a big way. The main character Caine is a fascinating one because we never know what to make of him as a character he's not a good person but he's not a bad person either he's neither a hero or villain because most of his actions good or bad make him a complex character with depth. Caine is a character who is smart as well and you figured that if it wasn't for him being a street hustler he could've been a doctor or banker but drug dealing and hustling on the street is all that he knew what to do. Even though we don't know Caine is a good guy or bad guy there were some scenes in the movie where we as the viewer have sympathy for Caine whether you agree with his actions or not and he is a character in the film that you will never forget. The ending of Menace II Society is amazing and in my opinion one of the most powerful and devastating endings I have ever seen on film and the first time you see the ending it will punch you in the stomach because the ending is something that you will never expect to be so intense and truly gut-wrenching. The ending in Menace II Society will stick with you after you watch it and is one of the reasons the film is a Hood classic. An amazing ending to a great film.The cast is wonderful. Tyrin Turner is excellent as Caine,with Turner bringing sympathy and intensity to the role. Jada Pinkett is wonderful as Ronnie,a friend that Caine looks after. Larenz Tate is brilliant,unforgettable and menacing as O-Dog,Caine's trigger happy friend. Tate is charismatic and frightening in his performance. Vonte Sweet and Ryan Williams are great as Sharif and Stacy,Caine's good friends. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as Tat,Caine's Father. Charles S. Dutton is outstanding as Mr. Butler,Sharif's Father who offers words of wisdom to Caine. Bill Duke is captivating as Detective,an officer questioning Caine. Glenn Plummer is incredible as Pernell,Caine's Father figure. Rapper Mc Eiht is good as A-Wax,one of Caine's friends. Clifton Powell does a fine job as Chauncey,a friend of the neighborhood. Arnold Johnson(Thomas Lawson)and Marilyn Coleman(Mrs. Lawson)are fantastic as Caine's Grandparents. The direction by Albert and Allen Hughes(The Hughes Brothers) is amazing,with The Hughes Brothers always moving the camera and bringing a great visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Hughes Brothers.The score by QD III(Quincey Jones III)is impressive and moody and matches the tone of the film. Fine score,Jones. There is also a great song by Mc Eiht called Streiht Up Menace which plays at the end. An outstanding song.In final word,if you love The Hughes Brothers or Hood movies I highly suggest you see Menace II Society,an excellent and powerful Hood classic that you will never forget after watching it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Depicting the life of one adolescent criminal Caine (Tyrin Turner) with little restraint or hints of glossing over the morality, Menace II Society is a harrowing piece and fascinating debut by the Hughes Brothers. Fragmented and chaotic in storytelling, much like the unplanned, unfocused everyday life the plot moves from event to event in a seemingly unconnected fashion, with only Caine being the stalwart throughout. Other characters appear briefly throughout like Caine's drug dealing father (Samuel L. Jackson), his unscrupulous friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) or Islam convert Tony (Anthony Johnson) fill in point of views, context and give a wider outlook at life in Watts. Events are left touched, but unfinished, as if small captions of reality captured on screen. The key character of the movie is Caine himself, who is equally endearing as he is menacing, dangerous and morally corrupt, an amalgamate of good and evil, leaving viewers unable to fully define the person along such close-minded perceptions.This method of storytelling does make it touch watching, lacking suspense or story-build, failing to connect with the audience. Nonetheless by the final act, when all events seamlessly summarise the life of Caine we receive a really poignant conclusion. The overall impact has somewhat waned through time and the filmmaking deficiencies in cinematography, sound or basic storytelling take away from what is an otherwise gratifying experience.

But despite that, I developed a sympathy for them. That is because deep down beneath the surface, we are all human.Many films tell a story that the whole movie revolves around. Menace II Society is not one of them. Although towards the end it sort of develops one, this is mainly a slice of life film.In some ways the debut feature from The Hughes Brothers resembles Fernando Meirelles' masterpiece, City of God, especially when it depicts the harsh reality of life for its characters. Yet for the most part, the Allen and Albert Hughes concentrate the life part instead of the death. It's more about how people live and interact, and generally go about their day-to-day business. Not only does this help us grow to like the characters, but it gives us a look on how life goes in this setting.There are some terrific performances in this film. Caine, the film's protagonist, is a great anchor for the audience. Despite having his share of flaws, he is generally a good guy, who really cares about his girlfriend, Ronnie (the wonderful Jada Pinkett Smith) and her son, and wants to make a good life for himself. He's a person that anyone can sympathize with. Likewise, the always terrific Jada Pinkett Smith is in top form here. She brings her usual cool maturity to her character, and she is the perfect love interest for Caine. Also good is Vonte Sweet in a small but nevertheless a sympathetic role as Sharif, the Muslim who is trying to help everyone else live a better life, even when it annoys everyone else (except the audience).I don't understand why Charles S. Dutton doesn't get any more roles than he does. He is a talented actor, and here he is no different. Despite having only two scenes in the movie, he gives his character raw power that no one else could give. When he is on screen, he fully commands our attention, and everyone else seems to just fade into the background.Menace II Society isn't perfect. Some of the sequences are not credible, and Larenz Tate is too over-the-top as the trigger-happy O-Dog. Nevertheless, the first feature from the Hughes Brothers is a great film, and highly recommendable.

It basically details the experiences of high school graduate Caine (a very under-appreciated Tyrin Turner), including a liquor store robbery-cum-shooting, ill-fated romance, and bad times that seem to be generally lying ahead with either crime or going out of the LA ghetto for good. While many of the themes in the film were previously seen in Boyz N tha Hood, Menace II Society- at least to my memory of both films (I haven't seen either very recently, 'Menace' more recently than the former)- the Hughes's have a more natural, rough-hewed combination of the hard-knocks messages to the piece with the portrayal of the characters and various situations.The film might not be perfect- I remember the ending not striking as well as it could've- but there are so many memorable images, scenes, performances. The opening, to start, as Samuel L. Jackson cuts a permanent impression on his young son watching a murder at a card game (striking use of slow-motion towards the very end as well). Then there's that cheeseburger man, who later was parodied (probably to not as great effect as originally shown) in Don't Be a Menace to South Central..., as well as Lorenz Tate's 'O-Dog', who is a near classic best-friend character, with all the energy and persuasion and subliminal fatalism that comes with the territory with these guys. It's also an impressive feat to see how shocking the violence can be in the film, even in short (or more-so dramatic) bursts. Despite it being their first film, and having made it in their early 20s, they've already made a film as accomplished and mature as someone might twice their age, albeit youth as the reason it clicks so well.Very cool soundtrack, dynamic performances, and even some melodrama that doesn't turn much icky when nearing the conventional, this is one of the better movies of 1993.

Similar movies include Boyz in the Hood and Dead Presidents. Menace II Society is, in my opinion far superior to either of these others films, featuring better acting, more life like characters and a better message. Unlike many other films, Menace II Society does not attempt to blame the crime and violence of the ghettos completely on racism and society, but recognizes that the inhabitants of such neighborhoods must make their own choices, and are responsible for their own destinies. The film provides the viewer with an uncensored, often brutal, glimpse into life in American ghettos, and asks some very important questions about American culture and society. Filled to the brim with cussing, violence and drug use, this film could easily be offensive to many viewers, but is all the same a triumph of a movie.

Menace II Society gave me a different look to that thought and how scary it must be to be there, to survive making it to 18 years old is just a huge accomplishment. Still, it frightens me how much we haven't changed, how these kids still kill each other like there's a war on. It breaks my heart that if one feels insulted they just go in a car and shoot somebody like a coward and runs off.Caine has had a very rough life, he grew up in the ghetto with his drug addicted parents and when his father and mother dies, he lives with his grandparents. But that doesn't stop him from leading a life of stealing, sex, drugs, and murder. In a life where some are proud of the way they act and kill, he's the minority when he thinks there is more to life than this. But he joins in feeling there is no other way out until his friend invites him to get out with her and her son, but it may be too late to turn back now after all he did.Menace II Society is a great film with very thought provoking messages. When the grandfather said to Caine if he cared if he lived or died, it just broke my heart to think what the grandparents were going through knowing their grandson could die before they did. I think this is a very important film, it doesn't go over the top and it doesn't rub the gangsta life in your face, it just gives you a certain view of how scary it is to think there may be no way back.8/10 "},{"Title":"This is NOT the ghetto","Date":"24 July 1999","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Menace II Society had a message, but along with that message came an incorrect portrayal of what the ghetto is really like.  It's easy for the commercialism of Hollywood to convince the Hughes brothers into making a film that chronicles the life and times of urban black youth living in Watts.  Hollywood dictates that young black directors make movies about the ghetto - including murder, armed robbery, car theft, and about as much swearing as possible.  But I am here to tell you that this portrayal of the ghetto is wrong.  When I first saw Menace II Society I loved it - because I was a young white male who grew up in the suburbs.  I thought it was so accurate of the ghetto and how it was so sad.  However, after growing up a little, having lived in Chicago for four years, and having worked with and socialized with numerous residents of the Chicago Housing Projects of Cabrini Green, i now have changed my opinion.  The characters in Menace to society have absolutely no morals, no respect for authority, no work ethic, and no desire for education.  The only symbol of education in the movie is the muslim kid who is clearly misled and ignorant and the sexual interest played by Jada Pinkett.  I find the film completely stereotypical and racist.  Anybody who likes the film without seeing this is racist themselves (even if they are black - if you hold stereotypes about your own race to be true, then you are racist) The urban black youth that I've met are nothing like the men portrayed in Menace II society.  The depiction of urban life by the hughes brothers is jaded i might add and I question their closeness to the ghetto.  People do not get shot and die every night in gang wars. The majority of kids don't try to steal cars.  And people from the ghetto don't constantly swear - that's just what the media has led us to think.  I'm not trying to be righteous, I'm just trying to be real and tell it how it is. Now if you can look past all the stereotypes, Menace still has a message - figure that out for yourself.

Various scenes in the film, which is largely a string of vignette-style events strung together rather than a fully formed plot, focus on characters discussing their motivations to either combat or work around the violence in their area, with some choosing to try and fight it by contributing to it, and others simply trying to function in a community that is more like a warzone.The Hughes Brothers, Albert and Allen, who directed and co-wrote the film with Tyger Williams, craft their film around two young black teens growing up in South Central Los Angeles. One is Kaydee Caine Lawson (Tyrin Turner), who's father was a drug dealer killed when he was only ten, while his mother was a heroin addict who died shortly after. He went on to live with his grandparents, though their strict, moralist attitudes rooted in religion didn't stop Caine from becoming a petty drug dealer like his father. The other young man is Kevin O-Dog Anderson, who shows his best friend Caine what he can really do when the two go to a Korean-owned cornerstore to buy malt liquor and the owners watch them suspiciously and nervously walk around the store. After the cashier makes a derogatory comment, O-Dog loses his cool and winds up shooting both the cashier and his wife before robbing the cash register and taking the surveillance tape. Just another day in South Central, it seems.The film winds up showing the day-to-day life of Caine and O-Dog, which involves Caine nearly dying after being shot in a carjacking, as well as petty crime involving cracking cars for insurance money. We also get a glimpse in the life of Ronnie (Jada Pinkett), a single-mother with a young son she is desperately trying to shelter from the bleak environment and unrelenting violence that engulfs the neighborhood. Her character's introduction begins the Hughes brothers' descent into examining different perspectives of the neighborhood.Consider the scene where Caine is playing with Ronnie's young son, who is clearly growing up fast for a five-year-old, as he loves to be able to hold Caine's pistol, drink liquor, and hang out with the crowd of older boys. Ronnie is disgusted by Caine's compliance with allowing her son to hold a pistol and hang with his friends as they sip some of their ostensibly endless supply of malt liquor and smoke marijuana. Caine claims that this is for the young boy's good, as this is a rough and rugged neighborhood that laughs at kids who are kept from witnessing the violence in such a miserable landscape. The Hughes brothers allow you, as a member of the audience, to judge for yourself on both perspectives and hear each of their characters out; it is because of this even-handed approach that we see that Caine's point, while holding weight, also shows the cyclical pattern of young black men getting incarcerated or killed at a young age due to violent crime or the solicitation of drugs, and we understand Ronnie's protectiveness as a parent, but wonder if that approach is also just buying time for another funeral.The Hughes Brothers take a very liberal approach to Menace II Society in terms of crafting its characters. Unlike John Singleton's directorial debut Boyz N The Hood, a film that illustrates how and why you should care about its characters and why they are all smart men stuck in a hopeless situation, Menace II Society never gives you a reason to like Caine and O-Dog. By the conventionality of Hollywood cinema, we, the audience, should detest Caine and O-Dog for their criminal ways and their unconscionable resort to violence and immediate gratification whenever they get the chance. The Hughes Brothers likely feel the same way, but they challenge us to find reasons for us to care about them throughout the course of the film, and see if we can find even some sympathy for their situations.For much of the film, I didn't feel too sympathetic, until the third act, which takes a strikingly raw turn. Granted much of the film is captured with a gritty sense of realism, one doesn't really see the ugliness unfold until the third act, when karmic revenge circumvents and finds its lead characters unprepared to lie in the bed they've made for themselves. Menace II Society's only lacking feature is the Hughes brothers' directorial choices; the camera never seems to stay still, and either finds itself oscillating around the main characters in a 360 degree fashion or loosely tracks its location in a way that sort of oddly details spatial relations between characters and their surroundings when there's really no need to do so.With all that being said, Menace II Society winds up using its narrative and directorial grittiness in a manner that's germane to its illustration of various character perspectives in how to deal with growing up in a tumultuous neighborhood. The end result bears all the pain, immediate gratification, and whirlwind of emotions you'd expect and winds up being one of the strongest dramas I've yet to see that details the hood in a painfully realistic light. Finally, it works to emphasize that while your drug-dealing and violent crime is indeed a menace to society, it's also makes, perhaps equally significant, a menace to yourself.

I find that this voice-over does wonders at making the audience sympathize with Caine's character. He was born into this society, and therefore is not to blame for his actions and choices. Though his character is not as unpredictably violent like O-Dog, and is somewhat mild. He doesn't carry a gun, and his demeanour isn't that menacing. The voice-over helps to gain some insight into his thoughts and is thus more humanized.Tyrin Turner does a great job portraying his character. As a young boy on the edge of adulthood and just out of high school, Caine has no direction in life, and even has trouble answering whether he cares if he lives or dies. The many close-ups show his confusion at times and at others, his indifference to violence, implying his slow immersion into becoming like O-Dog. O-Dog is represented as a bit of a psychopath with no remorse or conscience for life. It takes little to set him off and Tate does a fantastic job of portraying this terrifying character.This film is well made and the directing shows it. The Hughes Brothers perfectly place juxtapositions of scenes together for maximum impact. The flashback comes in the beginning and establishes Caine's back story while creating sympathy for him. The composition of shots too are done nicely, and complements the way the characters tend to travel in groups.There is a lot of violence in this though, and it serves to show a realistic representation but can be very brutal. As mentioned before, it takes very little to upset O-Dog and turn him loose. The swearing is also very apparent and not one sentence goes by without them. Sometimes whole conversations go by with just cursing.Overall a very powerful representation of ghetto society, where importance is on staying together and protecting one's own. Masculinity is also obviously a very big issue as they constantly try to assert themselves through aggression and cursing.

This depicts the unfortunate reality that these gang members never resist the street life and change for the better, forever becoming victims in the cycle of violence and, sadly, negatively influencing young children to be part of this life style. The acting and course of events are fierce and the movie's momentum keeps everything tense. Some viewers would find this movie riveting but probably would also find it upsetting at the same time as these actors are depicting the reality of a day in the life in the ghetto, which I find extremely appalling. In addition, most of the actors portrayed morally deprived thugs with not even an ounce of humanity in them. If the director had the foresight to insert at least a little moral value or redeeming qualities in the characters, the movie would have been more tolerable and you would probably learn something positive from the film, rather than watching a film that glorifies violence.Grade D- "},{"Title":"A electrically charged drama, Boyn N Hood on speed","Date":"30 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This is a more intensified version of Boyz n' hood, and more the better. Opening with a shocking double murder in a Korean convenience store, committed by a pair of black teens, the star performers of the show, this flick doesn't hold back on the out of control exploits and wayward youth of South Bronz, or more so the community known as Watts. We live in the shoes of Caine, one the youths from the convenience store, while his bad arse mate, Kevin, played by Larenz Tate, with raw intensity in this electrifying flick, was the murderous hand, on the account of the Korean clerk, making an insult regarding the teen folks. He really judges the two the moment they walk into the shop. When stealing the store camera/videotape, they watched it repeatedly where Kevin makes a sick comment about selling these babies for $9.95 There are some powerfully violent moments, eye for an eye kind of stuff, especially in it's fatal end, it's catalyst that has Caine sticking his wick into one too many girls. The bit where Caine got shot bad, and taken into the hospital where he's bleeding bad was quite tense. Despite influences from family and teachers, to choose the right path, it's wasted on Kevin, his fate truly something scary, where Kane could change his tune, which this is the want of the viewer. The fine Samuel L Jackson who briefly appears in flashback scenes was memorable, imprinted in my mind, when blowing away another guy at home at a card game, while getting friendly with his misses. Caine almost mirrors that scene later, giving a guy one hell of a pounding, for cracking onto girlfriend (Jada Pinkett) in a very strong performance I must say. The whole movie is very well made, and goes further than Boy's N Hood, with true moments of choking intensity and moments of heavy shock violence, especially Caine's shot scene towards the early part of the film. But too it's very potent. All of these things are what betters it.

I don't think this could have been more harrowing and let's face scary if it tried.   It is like Boyz N The Hood in a way but it's more darker and there are no real good guys , only guys who don't care about there life and whose life they ruin.   They are all very set into there family unit of Brothers and have no respect for one another as much as they try to show it especially O Dog who wouldn't jump in front of a car for a child if he had to.  I can't remember who played Caine but who ever he was then all credit to him as you don't know whether to love him or hate him.  I did neither I just pitied him because that's all you can give to people who are like that.   I thought all credit to everybody on board but all the praise should be given to Larenz Tate as the evil and crazy O Dog.   I have never seen a character so much in love with his own portrayal of life and hatred for everything except himself.  Was it Tupac who was supposed to play O Dog because I am so grateful he didn't because even though Tupac would have been good as he has been in that position, Larenz Tate is probably the better actor and let's face it, he portrayed thug life in a way which can put you off ever going around L.A.

Yet after viewing From Hell and being exposed to the Hughes Brothers for the first time, I popped this movie in my DVD playa, and Wham! It pulled me in as soon as the New Line Logo shot up. The movie tells the story of a young Hood-rat named Kaine. Although he's the main character of the story, he's certainly not the movies hero. Kaine might be intelligent (he's a HS graduate), have more moral than some of his friends, and display a degree of loyalty and dignity, but he is also a killer, a thief, a liar and a straight up thug. In short the Hughes paint him as a pure human being and try to avoid the audience from feeling outright empathy toward him. In fact, unlike Dead Presidents and From Hell every character in Menace II Society is so well fleshed out by the acting and the writing that we don't fell any hatred toward anyone (which is rare for a Hood movie). I think O-Dogg is hilarious (Nigga, you act'in lika little Bitch right now!, You all up on his Nutsac etc), and he's clearly a senseless killer who even Kaine distinguishes as America's Nightmare. And that goes the same for my dawg MC Eiht (A-Wax).

I must say that some of the acting seems a bit corny now, but the images, characters and the story are still as gripping as ever. MIIS is basically a remake of the gangster classic Public Enemy from 1931. At that time Warner Brothers studios had directors that were interested in telling real stories. Another example also from 1931, I think, was I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. Basically these films were about how life was in the early thirties for some people, like gangsters or poor people.Anyway MIIS does this too. People compare it to Boyz 'n' da Hood and Do the Right Thing. Why do the Right Thing? That movie has a completely different theme than this one. It deals directly with racism, MIIS deals indirectly with racism, but is about living a life of crime in the ghetto. Boy 'n' the hood is similar, but is a morality play and also coming of age drama. Just, because black people act and direct a movie doesn't mean it's exactly the same subject. MIIS is more a tragedy, as soon as you hear the voice over of Caine and he begins to tell his story you know that this is not going to end well.Furthermore the major part of the acting is great. Also a good thing is the dialogue in the script, it's all slang. When I first saw this movie I couldn't understand a word they were saying for the first ten minutes. This makes it more realistic, but also gives an almost Shakespeare like feel, because you have to listen with more effort to get the dialogue.Lastly for those people who say this film is racist and stereotypical. Please look a little bit further. Stereotypes are put forward yes, but not to characterize all young black men in the hood, they are stereotypes of individuals that exist, the nut, the player, the religious fanatic, the hustler etc. And even though they are stereotyped the actors do a really good job in deepening ther characters. I can't find any racism in this film with the best of my ability, I think the directors just wanted to make a film that would be very impressive and they succeeded in that. Maybe you would like to see a more Mr. Rogers type of movie which Caines grandparents watch as O-Dog visits. A movie about a world where everything is hunky dory.On a last note the point the movie makes is that it is not only your actions, but also your environment that inevitably lead to your fate. Even if you take the right actions the odds are highly stacked against you in places where there is little opportunity to get out of the mess you're in.

Still, brothers could create an atmosphere so unsettling and disturbing, that puts the film above average American indie.After watching Menace II Society, you could feel nothing but disgust towards talentless hacks like LaBute and Egoyan, who gained notoriety and fame, because of American audiences' (and sometimes critics') complete unfamiliarity with anything but American cinema.

Up there with Bad Lieutenant, Reservoir Dogs and a few others from an exceptionally violent period in L.A. -- the arrival of 'bellum omnium contra omnes'(the war of all against all); life in Hobbesian terms nasty, brutish and short.Plainly, this is post-Scarface, Colors & Deep Cover. Mostly it quotes Goodfellas, the Hughes brothers openly stated that it was a motivating factor. This is plain not only from the framing narration, but from the tethering of the camera to the characters, a la Scorcese.What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in energy and commitment from all involved. The advertised allure is 'this is what's real', but that's unimportant in movies. What is important is how the content exists as a cinematic experience of vision, audio, the editing of time and the perception of space. On those dimensions, two things score points the construction of this around the 'snuff' film, very much like Henry.... This is very clever self-reference, since the entire movie is a snuff film. The 'film within' acts as a maguffin.The other is the ending, which quotes Jacob's Ladder, not only depicting the life flashing before one's eyes, but tying up the loose ends in a visual shorthand. Too bad the Hughes all but used up their best ideas here, they haven't had any really good ideas since this.

Now, the movie could've spent more time showing the intricate realities of the lifestyle some of the characters chose to lead, but it didn't need to.

The movie starts with two guys, Caine (Tyrin Turner) and O-Dog (Larenz Tate), going into a Korean supermarket to get beer. The owner says he doesn't want any trouble but also says he feels sorry for the mother of the boy O-Dog. For O-Dog this is enough to kill the guy. From the Korean guy's wife he wants the videotape from the security camera and then he kills her too. Caine doesn't approve this behavior because it was over nothing. Later in the movie we see Caine can kill as well, for bigger issues. The story is narrated by Caine, a guy who probably was a better man if he grew up somewhere else. But he didn't grew up somewhere else. He has always seen violence. When he was about five his father (Samuel L. Jackson) shoot a guy in front of his eyes for the first time. His mother dies of an overdose. Now Caine is living with his grandparents who do love him. There are some other people who really care for him. One of them is Mr. Butler (Charles S. Dutton), a school teacher, another one is Ronnie (Jada Pinkett). She was the girlfriend of his mentor who is now in jail.This is a very violent but powerful movie. It shows how it works in the ghetto. I don't know if it is like this but after seeing this movie I believe so. The performances are very strong. Tyrin Turner, Jada Pinkett and especially Larenz Tate give terrific performances.

His short temper and trigger-happy tendencies made O-Dog such an unforgettable character surpassing the likes of Doughboy in Boyz N The Hood. I was real impressed with Caine's retrospective break down of his 'hood with the riots to the drugs, and before all of that - Dog shows a little of what I was talking about earlier at the grocery store in a very memorable beginning.  Jada Pinkett is also in this as Ronnie, a single mother whose baby is fathered by Pernell serving a life sentence - who Caine looks highly up to.

Some may argue in favor of Juice or Boyz 'N The Hood (which received a higher level of critical acclaim) but Menace II Society captures the desperation and mindlessness of angry hood youths unlike any other film.  It's a shame that Tyger Williams' screenplay was not awarded for it's depiction of the hood's harsh reality.  His dialogue is realistic and quirky, but funny and chilling at the same time.  Instead of painting the characters like the cartoon cliches they make themselves out to be.  Instead of glorifying their violent ways, the Hughes Brothers present these characters as being trapped by the ghetto, and use it as an excuse to live recklessly, steal and kill. Instead of the overacting you shot my baby! scene of Singleton's take on life in the hood, the film is packed with several touching scenes, which kick in at a gut level.  Specifically, the scene where Caine is playing a boxing videogame with his girlfriend's son and teaches him how to fire a gun, and the mother runs in and pulls him away.  We also learn about Caine's relationship with the baby's father, Glenn Plummer (who delivers a brief but memorable performance as a reformed, reeducated gang banger locked behind bars.)  He then sheds a tear and tells him that he was like a father to him.  He closes his eyes trying to hold back his feelings and asks Caine to teach his son how to be a man.  In those simple words lie the essence of this film, as in earlier scenes Caine recalls the advice his real father gave him, including how he was taught to cook crack.  The concept of father figures and the Id is touched upon in little detail, and in a way they seem like society's orphans but it is impossible to justify these character's lives, especially in the case of O-Dog.  In the opening scene, he blows a Korean store clerk's brains out of the back of his head and murders his wife for making a comment about his mama, then steals the surveilance tape and shows it off to his friends.  If there ever was a character who just didn't give a f**k it's O-Dog.  After Caine and his cousin are shot and robbed, they retaliate and exact their bloody revenge, in some of the most perfectly directed and edited scenes of the film.  Hughes Brothers showed promise with their 1993 debut, and it has gone on to withstand the test of time, and has become a bigger favorite than BOYZ.  The acting is more heartfelt and the characters are more clearly defined.  Either they express minimal aspirations to want to get out of the hood, or their too caught up in the gangland violence and mafioso-like status they long for.  In one particular scene, O-Dog murders a fiend in cold blood for offering a sexual favor in return for crack.  He then picks up a bag of cheeseburgers lying next to the corpse and asks his friends if they want any.  The characters seem to enjoy violence (in a manner similar to the characters in Goodfellas, who pillage out of neccesity AND habit) and don't want to let go of their vigilant lives.  The end is somewhat dissapointing because in it's own garbled way it's telling us that their is now escape from the hood.  The only reality is their own disillusionment with any other way of life.

It was the mid-90's where I finally got to see the film on a really bad VHS with the tracking all over the place &#x96; but since then I don't think I had watched it till this weekend. It is quite hard to believe that the film was once subject to controversy; not only is it reasonably tame compared to modern standards, but it is also pretty realistic and doesn't fetishize or glamorize the violence (as opposed to the modern torture porn genre for example). It is additionally confusing when one looks back onto a film that is about as morally-sound and positive as you could hope &#x96; pretty much to a fault actually.The plot sees Caine getting drawn into violence and ultimately we all know where this is heading from the start because the film is from a certain period and a certain genre. Watching it again it is disappointing that so much of the film seems clichÃ©d and rather obvious in terms of the dialogue, but maybe this is because it has been done so often since, it is hard to say in retrospect, but for sure the film does feel very obvious across the telling. This doesn't make it a bad film though &#x96; just perhaps a little clumsier than I would have liked. The delivery is still impacting though and the film does well to create a sense of characters with no future but death or jail; there are moments of relaxing and family, moments of joking around and moments of violence &#x96; the film does well to make them all just seem like part of life here. Yes the plot goes where you expect but it is still hard to watch and hard to stomach.The cast are better than the names would suggest. In particular Turner does better than I expected &#x96; he cannot make the overly earnest narration work, but he does deliver a good character. Tate has things simpler and is only OK; I found him a bit too slick to be the character he was playing. The support cast features some faces (Jackson, Duke, Smith and a few rappers of note) but generally the cast are unknown and pretty natural &#x96; it is only when they have to deliver some clunky lines that they struggle (man enough to take a live but not to raise one being an example).Menace II Society stuck in my mind because of the controversy surrounding it in the UK, but watching it now it just seems tame and fairly normal. Part of this is the film convincing the viewer of this world but it is also down to the fact that the film is actually quite morally simple and obvious. It does still have an impact and it is a culturally important film, but for sure it has its flaws and there are better films from the period tackling the same issues but better.

Must we all go into hiding?This is an utterly frightening story portraying the lives of young hoodlums who care so little about life.I was tempted to laugh when I saw the scene where the grandparents are watching It's A Wonderful Life. The latter film is so out of the realm of what is going on in today's communities.You have magnificent acting performances here that go by the waste side due to the constant violence and use of profanity. "}{"Title":"A film of raw power","Date":"29 March 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  On Friday, August 13th, 1965, the area known as Watts in south central Los Angeles erupted from a routine arrest of a drunk driver and escalated into a riot that lasted for six days and killed 34 people, almost all black. The Watts Riots showed Americans the depressed conditions of the area and led to the initial discussion of a redevelopment effort within the community. Almost 40 years later, little has changed. Unemployment rates are about twice the national average and the underlying issues of social dysfunction remain, seemingly immune to LAPD policing, the War on Drugs, or Habitat for Humanity housing programs. The despair of the inner city ghetto has never been more graphically and realistically presented than in the Hughes Brothers' Menace II Society, a film of raw power film shot in Compton, California one year after the Rodney King incident that triggered the riots of 1992. The film is more of a collection of brutal images than a coherent narrative, an explosive and disturbing picture of a community mired in nihilism and the hopelessness that follows. Containing standout performances from young actors Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, and Jada Pinkett, the film's violence is graphic and realistic, avoiding (with some exception) the special effects and highly stylized violence we have come to expect from the genre. Caine (Turner), who narrates the film, is a product of the mean streets and has witnessed violence his whole life. His father, a dope dealer, and his mother, a heroin addict are both dead and Pernell (Glenn Plummer), the man who he turned to for guidance, is in prison. He is forced to live with his religious grandparents and his only adult companion is Pernell's girl Ronnie (Pinkett) and her five-year old son. By the time he is in high school he is already dealing drugs and carrying a weapon. His best friend is a borderline psychotic named O-Dog (Tate), the epitome of inner city youth who have no stake in society, kill without conscience, and whose self-respect is only as strong as the weapon they carry.In the film's opening, a Korean grocer becomes the first target of the pent-up frustration of Caine and O-Dog who kill them in a random, purposeless act after the grocer says that he pities their mother and asks the boys to leave the store. The videotape, retrieved by the killers during their escape, is sickeningly replayed throughout the film by O-Dog as entertainment at parties. The scene underscores the racism directed at Asian storekeepers, also depicted in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, and brings to mind the general problem of white storeowners who act as middlemen for corporations unwilling to set up franchises in the inner city. When a new Denny's restaurant opened recently, it was the first restaurant opened in Watts in thirty years.Caine is bright and looking for a way out and we feel sympathy for him without supporting his violent actions and his unwillingness to take responsibility for his life. He is tempted by offers to escape, one with a friend who has become a Muslim and is leaving for Kansas, the other with Ronnie who is moving to Atlanta, but the only world that he is comfortable with consists of drugs, guns, and early death. We want him to get out before it's too late, but we know too well that it is hard to breakthrough the context of his life -- that is no hope and no way out. When he gets a neighborhood girl pregnant and refuses to help, the girl's cousin comes looking for him, leading to a climactic confrontation that leaves us desperate for answers yet unable to see any. Despite its cutesy title, Menace II Society is one powerful mother of a film.

I love movies with shooting and killing. Lots of guns. It makes the movie so much more exciting and keeps you watching. Well this movie has that and so much more. Unbelievable story about a teenager (caine) growing up in the ghetto and sticking with his best friend (o-dog). Its about payback and taking that to the extreme. watch this!!!!

Boyz In the Hood had a sappy plot and and a sappy storyline in it that was full of preaching and unrealism. the main character always makes the right choices and comes out good and everything. Menace is much better because while the main character does have some good in him, he cannot break free from the harsh society he and his parents were trapped in. The whole movie hits you and scares the hell out of you because it is truthful and this is actually what people do. If anybody out there is enough of a moron to give this movie a bad review, I'd like to know why.

Thug life is more like it.  The story is lousy, and if the Hughes Brothers were white, this would rank right up there with Birth of A Nation.   I found no sympathy in the main character, Caine.  He is more like the jerks we see in Goodfellas, Casino, and that Great American Epic, The Godfather.  Yes, this film belongs in that genre; it just has a black face.  I was offended at the time, when the studio tried to market this movie with Boyz in the Hood.  The two movies are completely different.  Just because it deals with African Americans, it doesn't make the two films similar.   And what is up with the ghetto films?  I haven't heard such racist remarks in a while.  So many complained about blaxploitation films, years before.  Menace II Society, however, is the real offensive stereotype.  To say that one film is the real deal for poor African Americans is a sham, and this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.   This movie is for people who enjoy violent movies, or just want to make fun of others.

I forgot my usual assessment, if the critics like it , beware. I watched the first few minutes and heard the over the top swearing, and had misgivings, don,t get me wrong I,m not averse to swearing, but gratuitous swearing, tends to detract from the content. The film forty eight hours has a great moment, when Nick Nolte,s girlfriend, calls him ,having been stood up for the second time, She says Jack, he says Yeh F---. you, and puts down the phone , great impact funny, not gratuitous because only a swear word would do. I didn,t continue to watch the film, and could,t see why anyone would like it let alone praise it. Critics seem averse to entertainment, action, or a feel good story. Prefering some formulaic dreary repetitive realism type story. "}]
