[{"Title":"One of better 60s Elvis films","Date":"1 August 2003","Score":"17 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Musical","Review":"  Welcome to 1964. Elvis is still stuck in movie limbo, the Beatles are ready to conquer America, and this movie pops up. Elvis has one of his better roles since Flaming Star, as he plays a angry young man named Charlie Rogers, who is not that likable at all. After Charlie gets sprung for getting in a fight with some college students, he heads down the road to nowhere for the next gig. That's when he meets Maggie, Cathy, and Joe. Joe runs him off the road and destroys the Big E's guitar and 'cycle in the process. Maggie offers him a job as a roustabout in her carnival until his bike is repaired.Elvis sheds the family friendly 60s image for this role. He is a cross between likable and a jerk. He has the benefit of working with a fine supporting cast. Barbara Stanwyck shines as Maggie, who lives and breathes the carnival life (She also keeps this film from being just average). Joan Freeman is great as Cathy, a love interest that plays much harder to get than any other Elvis movie femme fatale. Even Billy Barty shows up in a short role. Steve Brodie and Iris Adrian show up again to reprise their loud, annoying husband/wife roles (they just have different names and backgrounds in this one). The King manages to belt out 11 forgettable songs that include his better than average take on Little Egypt. This film also shows an era when the carnival was a profitable business (I laughed at seeing an orchestra pit inside a carnival tent). The 'Wall of Death' scene was also the basis of the Irish film, Eat The Peach. All in all, a better than average performance for Elvis in a standard formula film.

Good Elvis Presley musical, although the King himself is awfully pouty throughout. He sings several mediocre tunes in-between romantic bouts with pretty but bland Joan Freeman (who resembles both Susan Dey and a young Dorothy McGuire). Barbara Stanwyck is typically mercurial as Freeman's no-nonsense mother, and she gives the movie some kick. There are the usual carnival rowdies, a dim sub-plot involving a missing wallet, but the cinematography is colorful and the rural locations are well captured. There's a sensational tracking shot at the end done in one take, with the camera up and over the heads of the crowd, down along the run-way with the attractions and then onto the stage. A brunette Raquel Welch has a bit part at the very beginning, and Teri Garr is one of the carny dancers. An enjoyable star-vehicle for E.P.'s fans. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Better than average Elvis flick","Date":"13 March 2000","Score":"12 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Musical","Review":"  Whenever Elvis returned to his rebel roots, his product improved.

On the other hand, Stanwyck’s participation adds undeniable distinction to the film (her role had previously been offered to Mae West!) and lovely Joan Freeman projects the right mix of independence and vulnerability as the heroine.At least, the vivid carnival setting does provide plenty of opportunity for color, action, thrills, romance, comedy (courtesy of Sue Ane Langdon as a flirtatious fortune-teller) and, of course, songs which are not too bad – “Poison Ivy League”, “One Track Heart” and, especially, the Jerry Leiber-Mike Stoller penned “Little Egypt” – though, again, Elvis has certainly sung better ones in his Fifties heyday.For the record, an uncredited Raquel Welch can be glimpsed among the college kids in the film’s very first sequence and, unless they didn’t hit it off here, it seems rather strange now that they were never paired together when she became a star in her own right a couple of years later!

As club singer Charlie Rogers, Elvis is a little different from his usual stock characters from this period because the young man has a chip on his shoulder. He's a reckless person who never had a family and is prone to being self-centered and dismissive. After getting fired from a gig one day, he and his motorcycle are smacked up by a threesome of small-time carnival owners driving in their car, so they invite him to stick around their modest fairgrounds and work as a roustabout for a little cash while waiting for his bike to get back from the repair shop. Rogers is able to boost business with his singing to lure customers to the Fair.Barbara Stanwyck plays the strong-willed carnival chief who breathes the carny lifestyle, but she's saddled with a crotchety and hard-headed partner (Leif Erickson) who once caused a tragedy to a customer by not safely securing one of the rides at the fair, and who tries to keep Charlie away from his daughter Cathy (Joan Freeman). It's refreshing to see a leading girl who can hold her own and not easily succumb to Elvis' whims. There are a few decent songs here and there, if no great ones. Raquel Welch can be spotted in the beginning of the film as one of a group of young folks going to see Charlie Rogers perform at the club. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"Cool bike, hot chicks!","Date":"21 August 2011","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Musical","Review":" This is a very entertaining film. Elvis (Charlie Rogers) is a rebel biker who has a reputation as fighter and a womanizer. He makes a living as a traveling singer.Early on in the film he is fired for getting into a fight with a group of college toughs. While riding his bike to the next engagement, the father of a girl he was flirting with tries to run him off the road. To make ends meet, and to earn enough money to repair his bike, he joins up with a traveling carnival. The carnival is run by Maggie Moran, played by legendary actress Barbara Stanwyck. Elvis falls quickly for her lovely daughter Cathy, (Joan Freeman). The film takes off from there. It's a wonderful adventure and is sure to entertain. Plus there are some great music tracks. Little Egypt, Roustabout, and Big Love, Big Heartache are great examples. The soundtrack went to #1 on the Billboard charts. Some fun facts Raquel Welch has a bit part at the very beginning of the film, and Teri Garr is one of the dancers. The title song, Roustabout is one everyone remembers. However Elvis also recorded another song for the film called I'm a Roustabout. Roustabout was picked and I'm a Roustabout was never released. The song was recently discovered and was released as a bonus track on a CD in 2003. The motorcycle Elvis rides throughout the movie is a Honda 305 Superhawk.

Barbara plays the owner of a carnival who takes in Presley after the King has been fired from a gig at a club. Of course she owes him after her right hand man Leif Erickson runs Elvis off the road and damages his motorcycle and guitar.After a while what's keeping him around is pretty young Joan Freeman who is Erickson's daughter. And Presley's drawing in some big bucks and may just pull the carnival out of the red, the red being the mortgage that banker Dabbs Greer has on Stanwyck's show. That is if rival carnival owner Pat Buttram doesn't lure him away or fortune teller Sue Ane Langdon doesn't lure him with her own special lure.I think Roustabout ranks as one of Presley's best feature films. He was starting to lose his allure to the fans of the Beatles and soon enough his pictures would become a rote formula. But as the young man with a chip on his shoulder who becomes a Roustabout at the Stanwyck carnival Elvis is at his very best.For Stanwyck she saw this as a way of getting her name across to younger movie audiences. But after one more film she would abandon the big screen for the small one and did all her remaining work on television.The title song and a song called Poison Ivy are the best for Elvis in the 11 numbers from the score. I didn't know Elvis went in for satire but the song is a really acid number against privileged college frat boys, I really loved it. It's also what gets him canned from that club gig.Fans of both legends should be pleased with Roustabout.

He plays a singing motorcycle rider with a big chip on his shoulder towards college kids and people in general. He gets run off the road by an angry carny driving a jeep when Elvis tries to pass him. Barbara Stanwick is the carnival owner riding in the jeep. Since the bike is not ride able and his guitar is smashed she offers him a job as a roustabout until his bike and guitar are fixed/replaced. Of course there is a love interest in the carnival. She is the daughter of Joe. Joe is the reason the carnival is in hock to the bank because he was drunk when he set up a ride and customers got hurt. Elvis's singing starts to bring in a lot of customers including teens so the financial out look is very good as long as he stays. Staying with the bad boy image he liked but really couldn't carry off he finds trouble at the carnival. Finding a wallet lost by a customer he keeps it for several hours. He is finally on his way to return it and get, guess who?, Joe out of the clink. Sidetracked in the cycle dome he falls, the wallet comes out, and the girls think he stole it. Getting ready to leave Joe shows up and punches him a few times. Elvis does not defend himself, probably since Joe is an old drunk and his love interest's father. Elvis leaves and signs with a big time carnival run by Mr. Haney from Green Acres. The daughter goes to the new carnival to get Elvis back but she can't go through with it. Elvis decides to go back to the first carnival and saves it for Barbara and, oh yeah, gets the girl naturally.

Which is a shame given that it has vitality in abundance, sees the King playing a two dimensional character, features the professional workings of Barbara Stanwyck and Leif Erickson and is beautifully staged and photographed (Lucien Ballard) amongst a Carnival backdrop.Plot sees Presley as night club singer Charlie Rogers who has a big chip on his shoulder, getting into yet another fight he gets fired and via a motorcycle run in with Maggie Morgan (Stanwyck) and Joe Lean (Erickson), ends up working at Maggie's carnival operation while he waits for his bike to be fixed. He has his eyes on Joe's daughter, Cathy (Joan Freeman), but Joe, himself carrying a heavy burden, has a big dislike for the young upstart. With the bank closing in ready to close the struggling carnival, hope may come in the form of Charlie's singing attributes, but will he stay? Will he be lured away by a lucrative offer from a rival Carnie promoter? With Charlie struggling to ingratiate himself to the Carnie way of life, and him constantly failing to show his true emotions to win around a hard to convince Cathy, the odds against him staying seems short.Well how do you think it's going to end? Exactly the way you expect it too of course. But there is great fun and frolics along the way and it is a true spirit raising finale. The clutch of songs are not the best, though the beautiful tenderness of Big Love, Big Heartache and the interesting take on Little Egypt are reason enough to be pleased with the musical contributions. Presley delivers a good turn, a nifty blend of rebel yell and housewives baby, the carnival atmosphere is well born out and crucially the film manages to not undersell the graft that carnival workers did to put on a show for the public's entertainment. It also opens up a game for spotters of future names, see if you can spot Raquel Welch, Teri Garr and Richard Kiel in teeny tiny roles.A lovely enjoyable Elvis film, foot tapping and smiles guaranteed, and the King, quite frankly, rocks in this one. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Solid Presley film with good songs and a decent enough story","Date":"11 August 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Musical","Review":" Good songs, a solid performance from Elvis and a decent story in a unique setting is about what you take away from Roustabout.It's one of the King's later (and less ambitious) flicks but they varied in quality and Roustabout comes off well.

Despite himself he starts caring for the married couple who run the place (a very charming Barbara Stanwyck the better half) and falls for their daughter.The film looks nice, Elvis sings quality songs like the title track, Little Egypt and One Track Heart among others, he's in fine acting form and gets solid support from old pro Stanwyck and the story ain't too shabby either.All in all; a solid Presley film.

I think he should also tried to pursue his second career as an actor in Hollywood beside his singing career. He always tired to be funny in his movies. I also love his singing. Through the year of 1956 to 1967. I think his voice quality still maintained the early Elvis singing quality which I like the most. Of course the song Roustabout, he really demonstrated his character greatly. Overall, I love the movie- Roustabout. If people listen Elvis's recording in that movie, then they should notice that his voice sounded different compares his recordings from 1968 to 1977. I think I'm a big of early Elvis.

Blues (short hair, short sideburns).  There are a couple of decent tunes (Little Egypt, Big Love, Big Heartache) and the usual smattering of forgettable ones, but what makes Roustabout a cut above most of his other films from the era is a strong cast (Barbra Stanwyck and Leif Ericson, two veterans of Wallis' 1948 Sorry, Wrong Number) and a stronger than usual role for Elvis himself. He's a troubled, short-tempered sort here, one who, mercifully, doesn't sing to babies.

The King looks great in it too! Elvis plays Charlie Rogers, a moody, arrogant nightclub singer who after getting fired for being involved in a brawl after a show, is ran off the road the next day by an even moodier father who takes grievance in the motorbike riding Rogers eyeing up his daughter Cathy - played by Joan Freeman, one of the most average looking of the Elvis Girls. The leading lady in this flick however, is not a pretty young actress for The King to chase, but Hollywood veteran Barbara Stanwyck - one of the finest actresses of her generation. Stanwyck plays Maggie Morgan, Joe's romantic partner as well as owner of a nearby travelling carnival. After being driven off the road by Joe and having his bike put into the garage, gypsy (effectively) Elvis is forced to spend the next week with the family at the carnival and help out with the day to day running. Of course after initially being placed on Cat Rack and Candy Floss stands, Maggie soon finds that Rogers' talent is singing and he can certainly draw a crowd. She takes a chance by giving him his own show in one of the tents and the crowds flock to boost the ailing carny, so much so that a mega rich rival from a more modern, upgraded carnival swoops in with his wallet to steal Rogers from them. Rogers had initially pledged to stay with Maggie's carnival - if he indeed decided to stay i carnivals at all - but his hand his forced after several confrontations with the angry and aggressive Joe following Elvis' continued pursuit of his daughter. After Rogers performs several shows at his new home and Maggie and Joe's carnival is on the brink of closure due to increasing debts and a decreasing attendance number, Cathy finally wilts and sets off with her tail between her legs to succumb to Rogers' charms, lure him back to their carnival where he brings back the crowds, saves the carnival...and pledges to wed Cathy...to Joe's delight. There's a Brand new day on the horizon after all! There are cameos for Racquel Welch early on as one of the adoring female fans dating one of the guys who starts the brawl outside the Club, and the late Richard Kiel plays The Tallest Man in the World in a couple of brief non speaking appearances at Maggie's carnival. The soundtrack is regularly panned alongside the movie but I'm not sure why. The movie itself strays away from the stereotypical Elvis formula that critics became so obsessed with, and song wise apart from the obvious two Carny Town and It's Carnival Time which are both less than a minute anyway, it's a strong soundtrack. It's a Wonderful World, Little Egypt, Big Love, Big Heartache and There's a Brand New Day on the Horizon are obviously no Always On My Mind or Burning Love but nevertheless solid numbers.

Elvis and love interest Joan Freeman never generate sparks in their on-screen relationship and this shortage of chemistry isn't good for the action. When the leading man and the leading lady lack chemistry, the movie can do little to save itself from the doldrums. The most suspenseful thing in Roustabout occurs with Elvis mounts a motorcycle and rides in circles in a gigantic barrel. We don't even actually see Elvis riding inside the barrel in this Hall B. Wallis' production. We see him climb on the bike, but we don't see him ride the barrel. Elvis appears in a number of long shots where he straddles a bike, but a stunt man substitutes for him during a wreck that has the character smashing through a white wooden fence. Meanwhile, Elvis has a tougher time with Leif Erickson as a pugnacious father who doesn't want him hanging out with his daughter. The bad blood between these two characters doesn't change until the last minute. Barbara Stanwyck seems to be in charge of the carnival that she runs. She has a couple of scenes with the King of Rock'n Rock, but she spends most of her time lecturing him. Actually, Elvis plays a louse. He hits the road after a rather one-sided bar fracas where he drops three irate college students with his karate chops. It seems that they sought to assault him for warbling anti-college lyrics. Our hero gets back on his bike after a girl who worked in the bar with him pays his bail. As Charlie Rogers, Elvis tells her that bailing him out doesn't mean the same thing as buying him and he leaves her standing. As he heads for the west coast for a better job, he spots Joan riding in a jeep with her parents. Naturally, the father --Leif Erickson&#x97;is not amused by Elvis's flirtatious behavior and runs him off the road. Elvis loses control of his bike and his guitar is damaged. He sticks around with Stanwyck and helps out as a roustabout for her carnival until she can have both his bike and guitar repaired. Of course, the girl wins in the end after Elvis has proved that he can draw big crowds at the carnival.

Roustabout shows Elvis kind of reverting back to his 1950's rebel image to a certain point but without the sideburns & duck-tail & with black leather. He's a bit of an angry young man & a hothead like his character in Jailhouse Rock & is self centered & unsympathetic & not too likable. But Charlie Rodgers is watered down compared to Vince Everett in Jailhouse Rock.It has a good cast with some big legends like Barbara Stanwyck, Leif Erickson & Steve Brodie & they elevate the movie with some memorable performances. This is a formulated musical with an edge & with serious moments so it's not all tongue & cheek & bubblegum like a lot of his '60's musicals were. Leif Erickson as Joe hates Elvis's character for most of the movie until Elvis redeems himself by the end.There's also Pat Buttram from Green Acres as a big shot carnival master who gives Elvis a better offer after Elvis burns his bridges with Joe & Maggie. Other memorable scenes is when Steve Brodie arrogantly never misses the target when he keeps throwing balls dunking Joan Freeman plunging in the water endlessly. And the Wall of Death motorcycle show. And of course Elvis sings but his role in this story is a singer & Elvis sings 10 songs. The songs are OK but nothing to write home about.It's not one of Elvis's best movies but it's not one of his worst either. But it's one of his better formulated musical dramas that has some realism & the characters are believable & down to earth. If you want to see Elvis in quality musicals this one & Kid Galahad & Follow That Dream are good choices because these films are more realistic & tell a story unlike the rest of the trash he was doing during most of the 1960's.Regardless if you're an Elvis fan or not stay away from most of his '60's cliché musicals they're a waste of time.

But with a supporting cast such as this, it should have been better. It had Barbara Stanwyck in it for goodness sake, not to mention several veteran character actors. I think by this point Elvis didn't care anymore because why would he make such schlock. He must have been forced into it because he needed the money to keep up the Colonel and his ever growing entourage. He deserved better than this.

Sue Ane Langdon who played Madame Mijanou, Fortune Teller was in one western movie that I can name, The Cheyenne Social Club. Elvis of course was quite a western actor himself in such movies as Love Me Tender, Flaming Star and Charro. This is all just a point that I'm making. Elvis was born to be a cowboy actor as well as a singer. He wasn't only King of Rock and Roll, he was also another King of the Cowboys, as was Roy Rogers, and Gene Autry.

This character has quite a chip on his shoulder. It took some time until this character grew on me. This was his last very strong movie until Charro! Once again the plot was great as was the supporting cast which featured the late Leif Erickson the late Barbara Stanwick to name a few. I give this movie five stars "},{"Title":"Evis? Evis!

Let's see, where to start. Elvis sings a song with full orchestration while riding his little bike around. Elvis gets into a fight whips ass, of course, E sings another song no! really?, E meets a babe this film is just full of surprises, E gets in another fight, E meets another babe causing jealousy in the first, E sings a song, and on and on. I admit this wasn't as bad as some of the Big E's films, but still..... "}]
