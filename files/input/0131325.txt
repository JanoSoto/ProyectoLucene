[{"Title":"An Under-appreciated Satire","Date":"8 June 2005","Score":"111 out of 121 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Given Tom Cruise's recent unstable behavior, it might be the right time to revisit 'Bowfinger,' Steve Martin and Frank Oz's highly under-appreciated satire of the side of Hollywood we mere mortals aren't supposed to see.In Hollywood, there are no secrets--everyone knows who's secretly gay or insane, and who's slept with who, when, where, and what they got out of it. But no one wants powerful enemies, and in the quickly shifting landscape of stardom, where one can transform almost overnight and with no apparent or predictable logic from b-list character actor or teen idol into a-list mega-star and Oscar-caliber actor who can open hundred-million dollar movies and make or break the careers of his/her friends and acquaintances, no one wants to be the one who spills the scandalous beans.For this reason, 'Bowfinger'--the 'Spinal Tap' of contemporary Hollywood--was barely made, and upon its release was greeted with a politely, barely restrained gasp of horror from everyone on the inside who recognized Martin's unusually liberal borrowings from the gossip files to construct this smart, dry, tastefully executed comedy about a has-been-before-he-ever-was actor/director who concocts a scheme to sell his hopelessly bad sci-fi action film project to a major studio by surreptitiously following and filming a major action film star, manipulating his behavior when able, and then later patching a film together with the clandestine footage and a few shots with a body-double. Little does Bowfinger (the loser, played with typical charm and intelligence by the great Steve Martin) know that the film star he means to exploit--Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy)--is a paranoid, delusional basket case of psychological problems barely being held together (though, one suspects, also being held at the edge of sanity) by his mentors at MindHead, a bizarre, cultish, mind-controlling religion obviously meant to stand in for the Church of Scientology, the increasingly infamous faith/life method of numerous Hollywood stars, most notoriously Tom Cruise and John Travolta (musician Beck has allegedly also recently joined the ranks of Scientology, at the behest of his father and his girlfriend, the sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, also a Scientologist).Bowfinger assembles a motley crew of Hollywood wannabes, which include the fabulous Christine Baranski as Carol, an aging stage actress who drives around town listening to old recordings of herself singing show tunes; Heather Graham as Daisy, a presumably naive young beauty who steps off the bus in L.A. and immediately sets about trying to sleep her way to the top (Daisy is based on nutso actress Anne Heche, who exploited Martin before moving up the food chain to a public lesbian affair with Ellen Degeneres, whose sit-com was then at peak popularity); Adam Alexi-Malle as Afrim, Bowfinger's corpulent Pakistani accountant and the author of 'Chubby Rain,' the ludicrous alien invasion script which Bowfinger believes will catapult him to fame and respectability; Jamie Kennedy as Bowfinger's camera operator, who smuggles equipment out of the studio lot where he works as a low-level crew man; and Kohl Sudduth as Bowfinger's sweet but vapid excuse for a heart-throb. This gang of misfits works well together in various gags lampooning the film industry.But the film is stolen entirely by Eddie Murphy, first as Kit Ramsey, whose paranoid rants include the observation that a script his agent has offered him must be racist because the letter 'k' appears in it a number of times divisible by three ('KKK' appears in this script 111 times!) and the twisting of a remark made by the agent about a script--'it's not Shakespeare'--into a racist slur ('Shakespeare?!? Shake-a-Spear! You callin' me a spear-chucker!?!), and later as Jiff, Kit's nerdy and socially inept twin brother, who unwittingly stumbles into Bowfinger's scheme and agrees both to serve as a stunt/body double and errand boy for the film ('Running errands would be a real boost for me!' he gleefully remarks).One of the great things about 'Bowfinger' is the opportunity to see Eddie Murphy create two ridiculous characters the way he once did so frequently on Saturday Night Live, before 'Bevery Hills Cop' send his ego to Mars. He looks like he's having the time of his life, and the fabulous talent he has wasted so frequently on mediocre to painfully bad star vehicles like 'Coming to America,' 'Harlem Nights,' or 'Vampire in Brooklyn' is once again apparent, and triumphant. Together, Martin and Murphy remind us how comedy should be made with intelligence, humility, generosity--and, most importantly, scathing wit.Scientology gets fairly merciless treatment in the form of MindHead, a cult-like corporate religion led by Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp), who soothes the paranoiac Kit with new-agey acronym lessons (K.I.T=Keep It Together) and chastens him not to 'show it to the Laker Girls' when he hears the voice of Teddy Kennedy instructing him to 'bring the Laker Girls down a peg or two.' Given Tom Cruise's recent weirdness and the fact that he openly travels with a cadre of Scientologists who function like a Secret Service detail, it's not hard to suspect that Kit Ramsey was written with Tom Cruise in mind (the role was originally written for Keanu Reeves but was ultimately changed and offered to Murphy).Murphy's presence, ironically, may have undermined this film in its initial release, as audiences many audiences left theaters disappointed, having expected more of a traditional slapstick comedy with Murphy in a larger role (his scenes are easily the funniest, but Kit and Jiff or secondary characters). But it's well worth revisiting for its quality and its scathing critique of the business of Hollywood.

Believe me, this movie could have been over in the first few minutes if the writing hadn't started out so deliciously cynical. Immediately, I was hooked by the story of this downtrodden dreamer who endeavors to commit his life's savings to a hopeless cause. Forget about the weak (tacked-on) ending and the craziness for comedy's sake. This is a light character study worthy of a filmlover's earnest attention. Kudos to Murphy for the dual role-one a loving tribute to his inner child and the other a biting satire of his public image.  "},{"Title":"Steve Martin was funny, then he wasn't. Now he is again","Date":"28 April 2000","Score":"45 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Steve Martin, the funniest man alive in the 80s, lost his way in the 90s with the likes of Leap Of Faith and A Simple Twist Of Fate.  Now, after sterling work in David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner, Martin's return to writing and acting in straight-up comedy is surprisingly, reassuringly good. Bowfinger is a movie about movies, with all the potential for in-jokery and self-indulgence that brings, but for the most part dispenses with the clever-clever, isn't-Hollywood-shallow stuff to deliver laughs.Martin's Bobby Bowfinger, a struggling producer desperate for a hit before he reaches the 'unemployable' age of 50, hits on the idea of putting action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) in his new sci-fi film Chubby Rain without the star knowing anything about it. Consequently, Bowfinger's inept crew follows Ramsey around in increasingly crazy and surreal fashion, utilising everything from 'Will Work For Food' signs made of foil to cranes mounted on trucks to get the shot they need. When Bowfinger stumbles across a Kit double (Murphy again) who will do anything the director asks including fetch the coffee, he starts to think all his birthdays have come at once. Meanwhile, the neurotic Ramsey, never that stable to begin with, begins to lose it altogether as he becomes convinced that sex-crazed pod people are stalking him.It's a simple plot and, while the script throws a few barbs at Hollywood, it's played mainly for big laughs - and gets them. Heather Graham is spot-on as the ingenue literally just off the bus from Ohio who is prepared to sleep with anyone to get longer scenes, and Jamie Kennedy is all laconic wit as Bowfinger's long-suffering assistant. Really, though, it's Martin and Murphy's show. The original wild and crazy guy shows he hasn't lost all his manic energy in the title role, nor his wit with the sharp script. Surprisingly enough, though, the standout performance is Murphy's; he is brilliant as both the paranoid, highly-strung Kit and his dumb-but-sweet double Jiff. This might even be a career-best.It's simple, lightweight and throwaway of course, but comedies that try to SAY something, even if they're good, often just don't make you laugh that much. Bowfinger will.

In both roles, he's effective. Terrence Stamp, meanwhile, does his normal intense job of acting as the leader of a far-out mind group that one of Murphy's characters belongs. Heather Graham provides the sex appeal. Few women have made the transition from wholesome country girl to sleazeball in one movie as Graham does here. It's shocking but laughable at the same time, which pretty much describes this odd film. Nice to see Steve Martin back in form, too.

It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other's personalities, without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well, because that's what it's really about; how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences, and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.The movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie, to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger, of Bowfinger International Productions, a hack film studio in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team; he's unscrupulous, infinitely resourceful, and isn't daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid, stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.His accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don't ask, just watch the movie.  The movie is called Chubby Rain.  Bowfinger wants Hollywood's leading action star, Kit Ramsey, to play the lead.  As Ramsey, Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of Mind Head, one of those many Scientologist-like groups, where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears, like that of, of course, aliens.Naturally, Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn't stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever, if risky, idea follow Ramsey around, shoot him surreptitiously from a distance, using his own actors to play their parts with him, without Ramsey's knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real, while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey's style.Eventually, a stunt double is needed for certain scenes, and a Ramsey look alike, named Jiff, is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character, played also by Murphy as a slow-witted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time, to Murphy's credit, and a great movie character.I liked a lot of things about the movie, especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a high-powered executive played by Robert Downey, Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone; he may not take him seriously, but he's not likely to forget meeting him.I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  That's too cerebral for an audience, shouts Ramsey.  We're making a movie, not a film!  He points out that in the script he is reading, the letter k appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three, so KKK appears 486 times!What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke, improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly, even if he bends a few rules along the way.

His role was also well done.  A final mention to one star, but with four legs, Mindy (aka Betsy) who was used perfectly. Animals who star on any movie or TV show have a special talent, this dog is no exception.

Co-starring Eddie Murphy, Jamie Kennedy, Heather Graham, and Christine Baranski, I felt most of their wonderful talents went unused, untapped, and uncalled-for. This script simply did nothing to challenge these marvelous actors. And yet, Martin still manages to shine from within the boundaries of this dreary, seemingly low budget production. With a budget of $55 M, direction by Frank Oz, and a screen play by Martin himself, I really expected a lot more from this film.Honestly, they spent $55 M to make a movie about the making of a B movie for $2,184.00?! I would have to guess, since IMDb does not show his salary for this film, that at least 10-15 M of the total budget went towards the salary of Mr. Murphy, considering he was paid $20 M for The Klumps 2 PLUS 20% of the movie's gross, according to IMDb. That is sad in itself, but the finished product is so much less than the sum of its parts that it leaves you wondering where IS the movie? While it was fun to watch, this project just did not work. Good actors, great direction, a good budget, all basically gone up in smoke.While this is still an enjoyable film, I must admit I was far more than a tad disappointed in the finished product. The premise was good, but I honestly believe this movie was such a let down due to the actors' inability to switch out of B mode when not in the Chubby Rain phase of this movie. It is like once they got started playing B quality characters, they forgot to go back to A movie characters when not behind the camera...behind the camera. Confused yet? That is kind of the point. It is so muddled that I believe the actors got confused and Frank Oz forgot to help them keep it together.As a desperate movie producer, Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) must get a movie going, or go under. He takes a really bad script, and attempts to attract talent to the work. When that proves unsuccessful, he dupes his entire staff into believing Kitt Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) has agreed to do the movie, but has a radical acting style, where he films his scenes on the fly. So Bowfinger begins filming his movie, starring Kitt Ramsey, unbeknownst to Mr. Ramsey. It's a clever and funny idea, but somewhere in the mix, it just gets lost. And yet, I still like and OWN this movie. There is an appeal, but I could not tell you what that appeal is, anymore than I can tell you why it does not work.

After taking a look at it, I was more than a little glad I found it.Bowfinger is funny little satire about the film-making industry. Its originality may be its best feature. We see the story of a bankrupt would-be director (played wonderfully by Steve Martin) trying to make a scifi/action picture with a big star (Murphy) who doesn't even know he's in the film. Martin's character would make Ed Wood look like Orson Welles, or at the very least Ridley Scott. His crew is made up of a studio lot flunky (Kennedy), four illegal Mexican immigrants, a not-so-innocent young starlet, and several other hangers on. Kennedy is the only one of the crew initially in on the fact that Murphy's character will not know he's the star of the film they are shooting. In a stroke of luck, they find Murphy's nerdy brother (also played perfectly by Murphy) to use in scenes where a close up of his face will not be needed.Obviously, this idea is ridiculous, but the film is so well directed, that you almost for a second believe it might be able to work for a while. Martin, who wrote the script, knows all too well that Hollywood is an institution always ripe for satire. His instincts about what types of bottom feeders will do anything to break into the business are usually dead on. The film also takes a welcomed shot at Scientology, exposing it for the mind f*ck that it is. I also loved the way that by the end of the film, Martin's illegal aliens were the most professional and competent members of his staff.Bowfinger did manage to make a small profit at the box office, by many people have obviously forgotten about it. That is a shame since Murphy has made so few good films in the last decade, and Martin is showcased for being the talent that he is.

It's star, Steve Martin, is an aspiring film producer and director. He just has one problem. Nobody notices him. He decides on an absurd script about aliens written by an Indian accountant. He casts aspiring actress played by Christine Baranski in a supporting role and a young aspiring ingenue just off the bus from the Midwest played none other than by Heather Graham. The problem is that in order to get this movie noticed by Robert Downey Jr's character, he has to get Eddie Murphy's character to play the lead role. After all, he is the hottest star in Hollywood at the moment. He belongs to strange religious organization led by Terence Stamp. Anyway, the film is funny from beginning to end. All Bowfinger wants is the same chance that every other idiot in Hollywood gets to do and that is wheel and deal. He is smarter than most because Eddie's character won't even think of doing this role so he doesn't know that he is being followed and filmed. He thinks he is going crazy. They hire a look alike person who is also played by Eddie Murphy as the slower brother. Anyway, the film is just worth watching despite the silly plot. The cast makes you believe it.

The plot is quite simple. A low budget director must try and cast a popular movie star in his film without him being aware of it. The concept does seem flawed and a little dumb when looking at it, but when its on screen it's very entertaining. The film has an excellent comic timing and remains on a consistent pace throughout the film. Luckily it aims for laughs instead of sappy sentimentality. But the film really capitalises on its two lead performers who are accomplished comedians.Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy work as an excellent comic duo and sometimes overshadow the witty material of the movie. The rest of the cast are fun in their roles, but this really is Martin and Murphy's movie.I don't think Bowfinger received its full credit and some people misunderstood it. It's a farcical comedy, not one to be taken seriously. Yes it is unrealistic, but it wasn't attempting to be a classic. What were we expecting?

This deal involves Bowfinger getting the biggest action star in Hollywood, Kit Ramsey, to star in his picture.  Knowing he hasn't a hope in hell, Bowfinger decides to shoot Ramsey without his knowledge and piece together his scenes by using a lookalike for the rest of the film.  However Ramsey's paranoia over being followed is fed by the feeling of being watched and events spiral out of control.When I watched this I expected it to be hilarious and I must admit I did find it amusing and often pretty funny &#150; although I felt it could have done more and had more imagination from Martin.  The plot is so clearly daft that it opened the way up for Martin to be as surreal and as imaginative as he wanted to be.  Sadly he goes for easy gags too often and there are really only a few really inspired turns.  The plot really has no where to go apart from continuing this one-joke idea until the ending (which is actually OK) but the idea is quite funny and has lots of side jokes to fill it out.What really saves the film is the cast.  Martin is OK but he does a better job as writer than actor here.  Graham is also good but really is an one-joke character with nothing else to do.  Baranski is good but annoying while Kennedy, Newman, Stamp and Downey Jnr are good but are merely window dressing.  No &#150; the weight of the film is one Murphy and he almost totally pulls it off.  In both roles he is completely different and hilarious in both for different reasons.  As Jiff he is perfect and works the geeky role really well.  As Kit he starts well but, as Kit becomes more OTT and crazy, so too does Murphy's performance get stretched and feels like he's forcing `zaniness' where really there is none to be had.  That said he is great in both roles and when he's onscreen I had no problem's with the film.Overall this tries hard but doesn't quite succeed.  It is a good idea but doesn't open out as well as you'd hope it too.  It does have plenty to provide laughs and Murphy is great in both roles but I felt a younger Martin would have brought more out of the idea than he managed to do here.

He's a struggling director trying to get a film made, with a script called Chubby Rain, that has just wowed him over. Desperate for actors, including the sexy Graham, as a bimbo and budding starlet, he plans to shoot around Kit, who begins to go paranoid, unawares he's the star of Bowfinger's new flick, which this scenario goes down well, and at points, is rib tickling. Through the comedy, we see a lot of truth in this cut through business, like the audition phase, and as trying to get a film made, not to give up and hold onto your dream, which like other movies, we have an inspirational theme. Yeah, it shows you the pitfalls, arse kissing, whatever, as trying to get producers like and investors interested. Among the small cozy crew of Bowfinger's we have a method actress (the wonderful Christine Baranski). Again, this is so true. I've seen it first hand, as even though is a harmless lighthearted comedy, there's a lot of reality about the business underneath. The auditioning and perpetual kissing scene with Graham, and the lucky son of a b..ch is hot. But bimbo, like Graham plays well and all so innocent and sexy is an easy lay here. It's Murphy's geek character scenes I loved the best, a great contrast to his serious, movie star brother who's not having the best of days. The part where Kit went off spouting names of action stars/bad actors that rhymed I loved and was clever. There are some great lines too, ala Steve Martin, who even wrote that Guy Pearce thriller, Traitor years later, although I've really never thought much of him as an actor, where he did show some great character work in some films, but like Sandler, they were slapstick, comedy based, which demanded that style. It's what you call for an actor, taking the easy way out. One line, comparing a shallow personality, failed auditionee, to a zip code was brilliant, and one I've always remembered. On the whole, Bowfinger is funny, and richly rewarding, and a holy relief, after Murphy's prior dismal comedy pic, Life. Martin is on a winner here, with a nice inspirational ending. Up there with The Nutty Professor, Ed.

While Groundhog Day has justifiably gone down in history as one of the best comedies of all time Bowfinger is just another flick, one all too frequently ignored. (Though when I think about it I left it off my Top 10 Comedies of All Time list also.) Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is a struggling filmmaker who tires of missing the big projects, of being ignored and unknown by the big names, and of being doubted by those loyal to him&#x85; and perhaps a little tired of doubting himself.So as another project threatens to slip through his fingers Bowfinger decides that he will make his magnum opus entitled 'Chubby Rain' &#x96; a film about an alien invasion with the invaders smuggling themselves to our planet in raindrops &#x96; around Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), the biggest movie star in the world, by filming non-Kit scenes as normal and having his own actors approach an unaware Ramsey and deliver lines while the camera crew hide remain secluded.Bowfinger convinces his rag tag crew of aspiring wannabes and impressionable yet deluded staff that Kit Ramsey is merely '100% method', and is so consumed with his performance that he will not acknowledge or interact with them outside of his scenes.It helps both Chubby Rain and the film that Kit Ramsey is especially paranoid and delusional in all respects, on the verge of cracking altogether and constantly in touch with a Scientology-styled wellness centre called MindHead, run by Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp).At first things go reasonably well, experienced ex-stage actor Carol (Christine Baranski) is impressed with Ramsey's realism as he appears genuinely believable in scenes that require him to be caught offguard and confused, and aspiring straight of the bus actress Daisy (Heather Graham) takes any action necessary to further her role in the film and her fledgling Hollywood career.Things look pretty rosy, but when Ramsey checks himself out of society for a while to deal with his paranoid thoughts that aliens are trying to make contact with him of all things that the production grinds to a halt and a plan B must be hastily devised.Plan B is named Jiff (also Eddie Murphy), a nerdish but keen as mustard man who looks remarkably like Kit, enough at least to pass for him in glimpses and action scenes. Bowfinger works because Steve Martin takes nothing too seriously, he expertly lampoons Hollywood's ridiculous self infatuation and vacuousness (Robert Downey Jr has a brief role as a pompous producer).But this is another example of just how funny Eddie Murphy really was in his prime, his dual roles as Jiff and Kit Ramsey are expertly played and quite frequently hilarious, a scene in which Jiff is asked to run across a busy freeway for an action sequence never fails to floor me, and the scenes that show Kit's emotional and mental fragility are also excellent. This film should stand proudly alongside Coming To America as high water marks in comedic acting, a reminder of a time when playing multiple roles wasn't merely a lazy excuse to ham it up and trade fart jokes.Bowfinger isn't as deep as Groundhog Day or perhaps quite as funny as Coming to America, but it is masterful comedy and remains highly rewatchable. In fact with Eddie Murphy's career long since deceased aside from donkey dialogue it's good to acknowledge the once-genius of Ed, and the excellence of Steve Martin.Final Rating &#x96; 8.5 / 10. Bowfinger might not be the best comedy of all time, but it stands head and shoulders above anything passing for comedy over the last few years.

Well, Murphy isn't really a con-man in this movie, but Steve Martin is and he does a very good job at it. In one review they compared it to Get Shorty, which in a way it is similar, but Bowfinger is a much more straight forward that Get Shorty.Bowfinger is a director that wants to make his big break. He works out of a decrepit house inspiring the title Bowfinger International Films. One night he finishes reading a script by his screenwriter, entitle Chubby Rain, and decides to make it, but all he needs is interest from elsewhere. So, after staging a meeting with some executive, he is told that is he gets this major star (played by Eddie Murphy) he will have himself a picture. So he attempts to get his interest, but unfortunately he is not interested. But instead of admitting defeat, he instead decides to make the film using him, but without him knowing.What makes the film truly hilarious is that Murphy not only doesn't realise that he has been cast in a film, but he is incredibly paranoid, so when strange people rock up, throw water in his face and accuse him of being an alien, he freaks out. Bowfinger does a really good job of inciting his paranoia and Murphy does a very good job at the role.A few other things that I might mention about this film, as it really is a farce directed at Hollywood. First we have Daisy (Heather Graham), who plays a naive country girl who comes to Hollywood to be an actor, and finds herself involved in Bowfinger's film. Daisy literally takes the typical Hollywood actress overboard with her sleeping with everybody in the film, yet retaining a professional edge, and using her charm to get what she wants. She thinks that she is using everybody, yet what she doesn't realise is that Bowfinger ends up using her as well. But then she is not stupid as she learns that Murphy really isn't in the film, but plays along with it anyway.Then there is Mindhead, which is a payout of scientology. It is a cult of the stars, a religion that literally controls the stars. Murphy is a member and they are constantly trying to work out his paranoia. Yet even with all their influence, they cannot stop Bowfinger from blackmailing Murphy into allowing them to use him in the film.What is interesting is the opening to the film. It goes over a trophy case, which is mostly empty. This is another mockery of some films which like to show off a full trophy case with a out of it owner. This is a empty case with a couple of things from his childhood, but in the end he is a nothing director want-to-be. And the Mexicans that he takes from the borders are also cool, especially since in the end they all have mobile phones.

Martin and Murphy both put on excellent performances and after the insipid efforts of Martin's Sgt Bilko, Mixed Nuts and Cheaper by the Dozen (though I liked Bringing Down the House) and Murphy's Coming to America, Holy Man, Vampire in Brooklyn and Life, it's good to see a film such as Bowfinger that demonstrates their comedic talents and performances on screen. Despite the fact it was virtually ignored by the mainstream cinema/theatre goers, as well as the film press, it is well written and the comedic moments are amusing to watch. The final scene where Bowfinger (Steve Martin)and Jiff (Kitt Ramsey's twin brother played by Murphy) are donned in kung fu outfits and performing a farcical routine (with pop number kung fu fighting playing in the background) and where they fight the bad guys is the main highlight of the film. Another example is when Kit has to run through a busy highway and cars are speeding past, as he attempts to get to the other side of the road.Jamie Kennedy, Christine Baranski and Adam Alex Malle in particular shine in their own performances, although with Heather Graham, she didn't have much to do, in contrast to the other actors, in her role in this film.

Murphy had made one undistinguished time-filler after another (Holy Man, Metro and Vampire In Brooklyn among them), while Martin had fared even worse (with the likes of Mixed Nuts and Sgt Bilko particular weak links on his CV). Ironically both had enjoyed wonderful early careers, full of energetic and hilarious films and performances (The Jerk, The Man With Two Brains, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid for Martin; Trading Places, 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop for Murphy). I remember seeing Bowfinger sitting on a video store shelf about a year after its release at the cinemas. I'd never had any interest in seeing in on the big screen, and the only reason I contemplated renting it that evening was that I'd seen just about every other movie in the store. Rent it I did&#133;. and much to my surprise it turned out to be a rather good satire on low budget film-making. In fact, I'd venture to say that it is the best film that either of the stars made during the 90s.Low budget movie director Bobby Bowfinger (Marin) reads a script by his Arabian accountant Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle). The script, entitled Chubby Rain, deals with an alien invasion of the world, and Bowfinger is certain that it has the makings of a great movie. Bowfinger tells a dubious studio executive that he is about to make one of the greatest films of all-time, and lies that he has acquired the talents of the world's no.1 box office star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to play the leading role. The studio executive doesn't really believe Bowfinger, but says that if he can prove Kit Ramsey is aboard for the project he will release the film. Of course, Bowfinger doesn't really have Ramsey, nor is there any realistic chance of him getting him on his meagre budget, so he ingeniously decides to shoot the film without telling Ramsey that he is in it. A highly non-professional team of actors and crew follow Ramsey around, secretly filming his movements, while sending actors up to him in the street to do their scenes. The ruse seems to be working up to a point, but the problem comes when Ramsey actually starts believing that he is caught up in some kind of weird alien invasion conspiracy, and seeks help from his psychiatrist (Terence Stamp) to fight off the demons.Martin wrote the film as well as starring in it, and his evident enthusiasm sees him give his best comic turn for many years. Murphy also has a superb dual role, oozing arrogance and bewilderment as Ramsey while providing great laughs as Kit's nerdy younger brother Jiff. In one of the great comedy scenes of all-time, Bowfinger orders Jiff to run across a busy freeway, telling him that the drivers are all professional stunt drivers when in actual fact that are nothing of the sort! By pure good luck, Jiff makes it across unscathed, tears of fear rolling down his face. There's also a brilliant ending to the film, where Bowfinger's film Chubby Rain is such a surprise hit that he is asked to go to Taiwan to make a martial arts movie, and we are treated to some hilarious spoof scenes from his kung-fu masterpiece! Another great scene features Bowfinger picking up a bunch of illegal Mexican immigrants as they are shot at attempting to cross the border so that he can employ them as camera crew on his production! Bowfinger goes through a couple of slow patches it's true, and the plethora of in-jokes may not be to everyone's taste, but on the whole it is a tremendously enjoyable film&#133;. and proof that dormant careers can be rescued when the material is right.

When Ramsey refuses, Bowfinger decides to secretly film Ramsey, leading to some rather whacked-out situations. It only complicates matters when Ramsey goes to a Scientology-spoofing organization for a rest, and they have to hire a replacement.I don't know whether or not this is the sort of role that only Steve Martin could do, but he does a great job with it, as we would expect. Some of the scenes where they film Eddie Murphy are a hoot, especially in the parking structure. It was sort of jarring to see Robert Downey Jr, as this was released around the time when he kept getting in trouble with the law. Also starring Heather Graham, Christine Baranski, Jamie Kennedy, and Terence Stamp.

For some of this, it would be exciting, others puzzling. For Eddie Murphy's character, action star Kit Ramsey, it builds his paranoia, yet has no suspicion that he is the star of a movie written by the assistant to washed-up movie producer Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), Chubby Rain. In an effort to restart his movie producing career, Bowfinger comes up with a plan, a plan to make a movie with a huge star, one so big that the movie must be a success. Only problem they don't have the movie to pay Kit Ramsey, so they try to make a movie using footage of Ramsey on the street, talking to the characters of the movie while eating his lunch, and so on. The big ideas of aliens taking over the Earth in huge rain-drops that Bowfinger has in his mind leads him to want to make this movie great, he's just in no position to do it. The film crew? They're union, I suppose, but in an illegal-alien-from-Mexico kind of way. The actors? Has beens and naive never-will-bes from Ohio who buy into everything Bowfinger feeds them. The best performance in the film is by Christine Baranski as the prima-donna actress who really has no reason to think so highly of herself. Heather Graham is the girl from Ohio with huge Hollywood dreams who sleeps with everyone in the film crew in an effort to gain bigger roles. And then there's Jiff Ramsey, Kit's brother (also played by Eddie Murphy), the slower, dorkier ying to the action star yang that is Kit. When Jiff's not sharpening pencils for Bowfinger, he's running across a highway full of live traffic, though he's told they're all stunt drivers. Bowfinger is not a great film, but it is entertaining in the way it portrays the little man in Hollywood. There are film makers out there without access to the studio system, but still want to make a movie that appears to be a big budget science fiction film. The movie also takes a jab at Hollywood mind-cults at Kit Ramsey is a member of Mind Head, an outfit that makes him paranoid that aliens are after him, so his encounters with the actors in the movie he's in seem totally natural to him. Frank Oz hits most of the marks, and Steve Martin is perfect as the swarmy, calculating movie producer who hoodwinks the crew, and the star of the film, even when he has no clue what's going on around him.

I've never been a huge fan of either messrs. Martin or Murphy, so I was surprised to find myself at the film at all; but the reviews wree good, and Heather Graham.  The film aims to please on three levels - as comedy; as character study; and as a film about film-making - but fails on all counts.  Actually fail is too strong a word - the film's irritating self-satisfaction never allows for anything as grand as ambition.As a comedy there are simply not enough laughs.  With the possible exception of ROXANNE, I have never gotten the point of Steve Martin, and, as both comedian and scriptwriter, he rarely rises above the obvious here.  The jokes lack teeth - and while the film's lack of the Gothic melodrama which weakens many of the great films about Hollywood (e.g. SUNSET BOULEVARD), by taking it as seriously as it would like - the lack of any real trauma (surely the essence of all great comedy) makes what is essentially a series of loosely cohered sketches rather lame and lifeless.The film severely sags when Eddie Murphy isn't on the screen (I never thought I'd write that), and it's hardly a (double) role that taxes him. His nerd is particularly funny, even if he is the film's pivot into dreaded sentimentality.  The antics of low-budget film crews have been done so much funnier elsewhere (e.g. LIVING IN OBLIVION, a film intimate with nightmare), but Graham shows what a great comedienne she is becoming, and what a knockout she'll be when somebody gives her a character and a decent script.If the film is indifferent as comedy, it is a complete flop as character study.  Martin is a blank - we get no idea as to what drives him to make films.  Like the hero of ED WOOD, his woeful incompetence is compared to the towering, equally struggling, genius of Orson Welles (there is a poster of TOUCH OF EVIL in his house), but whereas Wood's genuine enthusiasm and love poignantly matched the great man's, Bowfinger seems little more that a cynical opportunist.Even this might have been interesting, but Martin doesn't pursue it. Bowfinger's past and private life is equally a void.  He has seemingly been making Z-grade films for a long time, but do people like that exist anymore? Don't they make adult films?  He lives alone with his dog.  He doesn't do the dishes.  He may have had a relationship in the past with the leading lady, it's not clear.  We don't know how he met up with his buddy the car guy.  His supposedly persuasive charm is anything but.The other characters do not rise above caricatures.  Murphy gives more of an impersonation than a performance.  The brother is probably the more believable of the two, but is really only used for cheap laughs.  Kit Ramsey, the action star paranoid at an anti-black conspiracy confiding in a very white Mindhead guru is only amusing as a plot excuse rather than a person.  Martin's misogyny is clearly revealed in Graham's part, which she gives more complexity than it deserves.As a film about filmmaking, BOWFINGER has pretensions to two films - IRMA VEP and the aforementioned ED WOOD, but lacks the former's belief in the transcendent power of cinema, or the melancholy cheerfulness of the latter. It's hard to believe in a film avowing an imdependent spirit that stars Eddie Murphy.  The film is pure Hollywood, the little man who against the odds becomes a (relative)success.  There is never any real danger of this not happening, or if there were we wouldn't care because the characters aren't interesting enough.  The supposed confusions of Bowfinger's kind of guerilla filmmaking are cosily tidied up in slick direction and a pat script.By its very subject matter, the film raises issues such as authenticity, reproduction, authoriality, as well as the integrity of Hollywood (!), or any collaborative product, but doesn't do anything very meaningful with them.  Like VEP, though, I have to admit that there is a certain magic in seeing such a low-budget travesty as the filming of Ramsey in the car lot, transformed into something approaching magic.  But Bowfinger doesn't want to make films anymore than Ramsey does - he wants to make movies, have lunches with powerful producers, attend all-star premieres.  The dash of sentimentality towards the end is so unpalatable because it is so sickly and unearned.  Martin might be a very clever man, but he is not a cinematic thinker like Assayas or Burton - he has no idea why people love movies, and need to make them.  BOWFINGER is quite funny, but do yourself a favour and watch a real, troubled, film like ED WOOD or IRMA VEP instead.

Although both actors are very funny in the film, they're rarely funny together.Despite what the previews allow you to believe, Murphy spends much more time in the movie playing Kit Ramsey (the actor) than Jiff Ramsey (the oafish brother).  This is good in many respects.  I found Kit, who is on the verge of breakdown, much funnier than his simpleton substitute.  However, since the whole movie is about Bobby Bowfinger's inability to get Kit in his film without covert filming, this denies any opportunity for those two characters to meet.  As for scenes with Bowfinger and Jiff, you'll probably find the scenes with Daisy (Heater Graham) funnier, even without the added sex appeal.The movie is still extremely funny, especially if you enjoy the occasional silly humor.  The entire cast, not just the two poster-boys, set up hilarious situation after hilarious situation.Low point the second-to-last scene with the Fed-Ex delivery.  It seemed to set up for a joke that never came; the humor was apparently supposed to be in the over-dramatization.  I'll never know how much Fed-Ex paid the filmmakers, but I had never been so put-off by movie commercialism since Bond turned down Aston-Martin for BMW.High point the final scene.  If you enjoy a little silliness to go with your movie, then this should redeem most of the low-points.Overall, this movie is more like watching two screens, one with a Steve Martin movie and one with Eddie Murphy.

Steve Martin is the producer and Eddie Murphy is the star (as well as the star's goofy double) and when 'Bowfinger' came out, it seemed like a dream come true, two great comedic talents joining forces to make what would surely be a comedy classic. Alas, such is not the case. If only 'Bowfinger' was as wonderful as Roger Ebert's review makes it sound. For every gag that works, there are five that fizzle. There is a forced quality to the film; it's as if Steve Martin decided briefly to return to the no-holds-barred lunacy of his first few films ('The Jerk', 'Man With Two Brains,' 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid') and then found he just didn't have it in him any more. What should have been a howler turns out to be a pleasant way to kill an hour and a half and nothing more. Comedy, as someone once said, is a funny thing and it's not enough to have a funny idea or funny actors or funny situations or even all three. Everything, right down to the camera angle and the way the film is edited, has to be just right for the gags to work. And what is lacking in 'Bowfinger' is persistent determination to see the material through. The epilogue, where Martin and Murphy do a brief send-up of kung fu movies, is emblematic of the whole film; it feels half-baked and thrown together without much thought. 'Bowfinger' is good for some laughs but with all it had going for it, the film should be approximately ten times better than it is.

I attended a press screening of Bowfinger, not quite sure what to expect, and although I was amused by the silly antics, I felt as if the film's main goal was to make a statement or two about Hollywood and what it takes to get a movie made.  First of all, while Eddie Murphy is in the film quite a bit, this is definitely Steve Martin's movie.  I left the film feeling that Eddie was not much more than funny set dressing rather than being a star.  Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, a washed up film director who gets a script from one of his employees that he feels is great movie material.  He soon realizes that the only way anyone will pick this film up is if he gets a big name star for the lead.  His focus turns to Kit Ramsey, played by Murphy, who happens to be the hottest star in Hollywood.  But Martin fails to get Ramsey behind the film, even though in some ways this is just the kind of script Ramsey wants.  So Bowfinger decides he'll shoot the film's scenes with Ramsey, even though Ramsey doesn't realize he's in the shot, by having his actors walk up to him in public and say their lines as if they're playing out the scene.  This works for a while, but soon Ramsey gets freaked out by all the strange behavior, and hides with his friends at the manipulative Scientology-like center, which is headed by Terance Stamp.  In the meantime, Heather Graham's character, a struggling actress, begins to sleep with every member of Bowfinger's crew, including Bowfinger, in an attempt to increase the length of her scenes.  With Ramsey in hiding, Bobby casts a look-alike to fill in for his scenes, only this guy, portrayed as the ultimate nerd by Murphy, can barely stand still much less play his scenes.  The movie goes from one silly scenario to another without having much direction with the story, all the while keeping the audience amused.  But I got the feeling I had seen all this before, with Tim Burton's Ed Wood, and once I reached the end of the film, I knew I had.  So in closing, there's nothing really new here, and not a lot of story to analyze, but plenty of laughs.  Bowfinger is an amusing and entertaining comedy, but I can't help but feel that it falls short of it's true potential.  Not a bad film, but not a great one either.

I wouldn't have recognized Steve Martin at the time, but am surprised I didn't recognize Eddie Murphy. Sometime within the past six months or so, I came across the IMDb page for Bowfinger, and it wasn't long before I could tell what it was. When I discovered that, I intended to watch it again, and did just that this week. I knew it was nowhere near being one of the most popular comedies of all time, but it had reasonably wide appeal, so I was expecting a movie that would make me laugh (can't remember how funny I found it the first time), even if it wasn't totally consistent with the humour, and for the most part, I was pleased.Bobby Bowfinger is a struggling wannabe filmmaker who is now 49 years old and still trying to make a movie and get it released. For most of his life, he has been saving money for production costs. When he receives a silly sci-fi script entitled Chubby Rain, written by an accountant named Afrim, he thinks it's a great script and is determined to make a film out of it, so he invites Afrim over to his house and rounds up a cast of several wannabe movie stars, a camera operator named Dave who can borrow equipment from the studio he works at, and a crew from Mexico. Bowfinger goes to meet a studio executive named Jerry Renfro, who agrees to distribute the film, but only if Hollywood mega-star Kit Ramsey has a part in it. After Kit refuses the role, Robert K. Bowfinger decides he will have his cast act out their scenes in the mega-star's presence, without him knowing he's in the movie, while the crew hides with the camera and films these scenes! The cast is convinced that Kit does know he's in the movie but is method acting, and they are not to speak to him outside their scenes.The title character in his flick is played by Steve Martin, and the comedian certainly shows his talent here. Not only did he star in this comedy, he also wrote it. Eddie Murphy plays two characters here, the self-centred, arrogant, paranoid Kit Ramsey and his goofy, nerdy identical brother, Jiff. These two characters differ greatly from one another, but Murphy is very funny in both roles! The cast is mostly strong, also featuring Adam Alexi-Malle as Afrim, Christine Baranski as Carol (a member of the Chubby Rain cast), Terence Stamp as Terry Stricter (Kit Ramsey's councilor), etc. Heather Graham is not a very good actress, but I think even she has her moments here in the role of Daisy, another member of the cheesy movie's cast. Bowfinger may seem somewhat bland around the beginning, and only moderately funny at best for a while, but that changes. The movie is not entirely consistent, but there are so many funny bits of dialogue, and also really funny parts showing the process of Kit's scenes being filmed (with the other cast members playing their roles and the big star's reactions to them), and eventually Jiff doing his part for Bowfinger's project. The gags are enough to make this comedy funny for the most part, sometimes even hilarious! If you like the 1994 Tim Burton movie, Ed Wood and its premise, Bowfinger might be another film for you to check out, even though one difference between the two is that is that this one is not based on a true story.

Imagine the boldness and audacity of a sleazy Hollywood director who shoots a motion picture starring an action hero who has no consciousness of ever being filmed! The director is Robert K. Bobby Bowfinger (Martin), and the action star is Kit Ramsey (Murphy). Bowfinger devises all kinds of trickery and bamboozlement in order to star Kit in his new action movie Chubby Rain without Kit's knowledge. Kit is a smooth, fast-talking wit who unknowingly uses his paranoia about aliens to Bowfinger's advantage as his film crew secretly shoots Kit reacting in confusion to the antics of Bowfinger's actors. The end result Bowfinger takes the audience for a wild ride!My favorite scenes in Bowfinger include the following (DO NOT read any further if you have not yet seen this movie). Kit's nerdy brother, named Jiffrenson Jiff Ramsey (also played by Eddie Murphy), literally breaks out of his comfort zone as he fills in for Kit dashing across heavy, brisk freeway traffic while being filmed by Bowfinger's crew. Kit and his bodyguards panic as they try to dodge a car heading toward them in reverse; again, the action is secretly being filmed by Bowfinger's crew, with his first cameraman Dave (Jamie Kennedy) hidden in a ton of shrubbery on an elevated platform attached to a truck. Kit's paranoia in the parking garage scene is greatly enhanced by the high-heeled shoes worn by Bowfinger's dog Betsy. Bowfinger drives across the border into Mexico and rescues four fleeing natives from a war zone; they become his film crew! And finally, this movie boasts an excellent soundtrack; I especially like Marvin Gaye's You're a Wonderful One, heard during some of the opening scenes when Bowfinger steals an expensive suit jacket and sets out to crash a lunch date with big-time producer Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey, Jr.); as well as the funky Pick Up the Pieces, heard at the premiere of Chubby Rain.If you ask me, Bowfinger is a wildly enjoyable cinematic smash hit! In addition to Martin and Murphy, we have the great Jamie Kennedy as cameraman Dave; Heather Graham as a somewhat irritating nymphomaniac actress named Daisy; Christine Baranski as a wonderfully funny prima donna named Carol; Adam Alexi-Malle as screenwriter Afrim; Kohl Sudduth as wannabe actor Slater; Robert Downey, Jr. as producer Jerry Renfro; and Terence Stamp as Terry Stricter, Kit's MindHead counselor.

He's pretty good, and so are the other performers. Loved Eddie Murphy as the loser/brother of Kit Ramsey. The film is efficiently directed.The humor, as in a lot of Steve Martin's stuff in The New Yorker, depends on incongruities and irony. The incongruity begins with the title of the film-within-a-film that Martin is supposed to be directing -- Chubby Rain. (Cf., Cruel Shoes.) The irony shows up in scenes like the post-coital murmurs between Martin and Heather Graham as a would-be actress sleeping her way to the top. I love you. I promise you I'll never use you, she tells him. And I will never betray your trust, he swears, after just having pocketed her credit card.Frank Oz did a good job on the direction. The scene is which an Eddie Murphy look alike (Eddie Murphy) is told to run across a multiple-lane freeway full of speeding cars and trucks is nearly perfectly done. Not just the idea but the set up and execution. The editing couldn't be better. Oz had to transpose that scene from a more-or-less detailed written screenplay into two dimensional images.Sometimes the script gives Oz an easier job than at others. As the end of the film approaches the pace becomes frantic and there were times when I lost it. Something to do with aliens and pod people. (One shot is lifted directly from Invasion of the Body Snatchers.) Martin is a bright and imaginative guy, obviously. His humor borders on the fantastic. Things take place that are physically impossible. And the jokes are liable to be over the head of a less alert audience. I mean, are the kids really going to get the connection between MindBust and Dianetics? Will they recognize the allusion to the pod people? He's rather like a West Coast Woody Allen, without the serious side, but more of a physical actor. His notion of what's funny is more literary than cinematic, bent slightly towards the late S. J. Perelman. I thought Martin's first film, The Jerk, was a disaster but there were scenes and dialog in this one that had me laughing out loud. When Eddie Murphy, as a famous movie star, is offered a script, he counts up all the k's in the text, divides by three, and comes up with the number of times the KKK is mentioned in code.

Think of who they've teamed him up with recently- with Steve Martin in this, Owen Wilson in I-Spy, Robert DeNiro in Showtime and Michael Rappaport in Metro.Once again, Eddie features in another ok comedy, with a few good moments and that's it. WHo would have thought his best movies would be two of his first Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop. Murphy plays Kit Ramsay, a superstar actor very similar to boxer Kelly Robinson in I-Spy, an obnoxious loudmouth with a few issues. The Ramsay character is annoying and pretty unfunny, thankfully he also stars as Kit's nerdy twin brother. Most of the gold in the movie comes from the twin brother (see his foray into acting and his passion for errands). Besides Eddie, we have a solid performance from Martin as a struggling director, desperate for a major motion picture. He comes up with a clever scheme to make it big time and throws everything at it- but will it pay off? You'll have to see it to find out.

As a result, the second viewing left me with a different impression than my first viewing. It did seem funnier the second time around. Mostly because my high expectations for it were already flushed down the toilet the first time I viewed it. This is not always a bad thing. When you watch a movie for the first time you often have unrealistic or misguided expectations about what it should be. Part of the problem with this movie is that people watch it and hope that both Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy will be the same cutting-edge type groundbreaking comedians that they were in their prime. So, when you see this film you are inevitably disappointed. My biggest complaint about this film would be that it could have been a bit more Zany. By this I mean that at their (Martin and Murphy's) age and level of success it seems they don't want to take chances. As a result they produce a kind of Bland tasting quaker-oats-esque style of comedy. It kind of leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. The truth is that they are both still very good. They are just not the same comedians that they once were. So, this movie is actually not all that bad, if you watch it without expecting too much. this is also why people usually say it could have been better. After seeing this film for the second time I would say that I liked it. It showed Steve Martin's creative writing ability (ie. the dog in designer pumps). It was also nice to see Murphy playing a role where is not the smartest/wittiest/most talented person in the room for a change.So, I guess some movies are just better the second time around. I could think of dozens of movies on the top of my head that did well at the box office yet were intellectually inferior to this film. Definitely worth a $0.99 rent at your local gas station. Jack P.

But the whole thing just watching Steve Martin being a total moron filming a huge star without him knowing just killed me inside. I ended up screaming with laughter just laughing at the producers and the script writer. And the actors, especially Steve Martin. Parts of the movie might have been funny, but not in comparison to thinking just how big the losers can get. 'Chubby Rain'. Yeah. That's rich.

Then Afrim writes what appears to be a winning script about aliens who come to Earth in raindrops. (The title 'Chubby Rain'). All it needs is a major star such as action hero Kit Ramsey. When Ramsey says no, Bowfinger simply tells everyone Ramsey said he would do the film only under certain very strange conditions. He only tells cameraman Dave that Ramsey is to be filmed without his knowledge. The parts of the movie that don't involve Ramsey can be filmed separately. Bowfinger has a budget of only about $2000, so he goes out in the desert and hires a Spanish-speaking crew. He charges $25 for auditions, whether the person gets the part or not. An innocent girl from Ohio named Daisy succeeds in her audition, though she later turns out to be not so innocent. Ramsey is already paranoid and not nice at all. But when strange things start happening, he starts going over the edge. He already sees a psychiatrist at a place called MindHead, and treatment becomes even more urgent. Things get worse when Carol, one of Bowfinger's actresses, decides to have a conversation with Ramsey, thinking he knows.Meanwhile, a stand-in is needed for long shots and shots from the back, and the perfect person is found. Jiff has a dorky, gee-whiz quality about him, and all he needs is a haircut and contact lenses.The movie was funniest when Ramsey was being filmed without his knowledge. The scenes with Jiff were also great. During the second half, things got really wild. At one point, though, it appeared things were going to fall apart, but the movie redeemed itself by the end and things turned out great.Steve Martin was his usual self, which means good as always. But Eddie Murphy was very funny in his multiple roles. I don't recall him ever playing any characters like Jiff, though in 'The Klumps' his Buddy Love was a lot like Ramsey. Ramsey was so mean but also vulnerable, not in a touching way but always about to scream when things happened. Jiff, on the other hand, was Ramsey's total opposite--sweet, fun-loving, somewhat scared. Heather Graham made an appealing Daisy, though she did become manipulative as the movie progressed. I'm not sure what to say about Christine Baranski. She's usually so good, but her performance seemed cartoonish to me. If that was the intention, then she did her part well.This was great. It seemed to end all too quickly, though.     "}{"Title":"A comic gem","Date":"19 July 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  A great story, a great cast and a belly full of laughs.

Even if they showed the funniest scenes in the previews, it looked like it would be a fun film. And it was. Eddie Murphy playing dual roles, Steve Martin as a film director, and Heather Graham as the beautiful woman, Bowfinger has all the right parts for a late summer, fun comedy.Steve Martin plays Bowfinger, a hapless director/producer who is broke. His accountant writes a screenplay entitled Chubby Rain and Bowfinger decides that this is the movie to make his comback with. The problem is, no one will work for him, and no producer will produce the film without a major star like Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). Ramsey of course won't have anything to do with Bowfinger, so Bowfinger decides to do what any normal director would do. Film the movie with Ramsey as the star, just don't tell Ramsey he's in the film. He figures he can film all the scenes that don't involve Ramsey with his cast of characters (including Heather Graham, Christine Baranski and Jamie Kennedy), and shoot footage for Ramsey without his knowledge, then edit it all together. Along the way he picks up a Kit Ramsey look alike named Jiff, who is all geek (also Eddie Murphy). They all work their magic and in the end, manage to make Chubby Rain a success.This movie had a lot of funny moments, most of them involving Murphy. Having him play two characters allowed him to show two different comedic sides. Kit was an in your face maniac, while Jiff was all geek. Seeing Murphy playing Jiff was especially funny. Steve Martin seemed content allowing Murphy to get most of the laughs, while he played the straight role. Heather Graham was used mostly for her physical appeal. Her character was basically someone who used sex to get her way to the top. Not that I'm complaining mind you. There was one story line that I didn't really like, and that was the whole cult thing that Kit kept going back to. The only thing I could think of was that it was an attack on Scientology or something, but I don't know enough about Scientology to know that. If it was a joke I didn't get it, which is certainly possible. I just didn't think it did very much for the story, or provide any real comical moments.  So overall Bowfinger was a cute and funny movie that is perfect for late summer viewing. If you like Eddie Murphy and wonder why in the hell he made Holy Man, go see this film and you'll see something more resembling the old Murphy comic abilities. If you're a guy, any chance you get to see Heather Graham you should take. And if you're a Steve Martin fan, you'll get to see him somewhat restrained, but still a joy to watch.

Not only do Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy (in a dual role) demonstrate exceptional acting skills (the facial expressions alone are priceless... Eddie Murphy's 'face of fear' is both believable and hysterical), but Steve Martin also shows his considerable comedic writing talents as the film's screenwriter. The premise is funny yet simple. Let's make a really bad movie that we think is great with a star who doesn't know he's in it! On top of that, let's forget about a budget, plot, permission, or a conscience. Oh, and the fact that the film-within-a-film is about aliens which happens to be the star's greatest phobia -- again, the star of a film he doesn't have a clue he's in -- is pure genius. Martin expertly interweaves a crazy fictitious plot within a crazy fictitious plot! The product is a great comedic achievement far better than most Woody Allen comedic satires. The humorous elements were subtle and unpredictable yet incredibly funny in their execution. When Martin's character says he'll have to find the best crew he can afford, then the next shot is Martin and his cohorts at the US-Mexican border in a van with back doors open waiting to grant safe harbor for illegal border crossers fleeing gunfire was hysterical. He got his crew, who turn out to be film aficionados themselves! Another funny touch... This crew is suddenly fluent in English by the end of the film. Amazing what myths Hollywood can perpetuate. Besides being exceptionally funny, what's great is that no one escapes Steve Martin's pointed pen. Ambitious starlets, greedy Hollywood moguls, deranged film icons, the superficiality of materialism and dubious status symbols, insincere Hollywood accolades for film premiers not worth the price of admission, even Scientology masquerading in the form of MindHeads. All are well-deserved targets of Martin's obvious inside knowledge of contemporary Hollywood. The ending shouldn't be missed! Martin's character, the down-on-his-luck movie producer and director becomes a star in his own right, making (not B but Z) movies in Taiwan together with the less-than-stellar talents of the brother of his earlier film's major star. While extremely funny to watch, it's ironic in its truth. There are hundreds of filmmakers who feel successful making similar schlock. These aren't even worthy of being direct-to-video releases, but have their premiers in third-world nations via bootleg tapes likely financed by investors who want the losses for tax purposes. Bowfinger, however, is not such a film. It's well made, funny, and insightful. The acting, particularly by Martin and Murphy, takes the movie to a higher level. In his two roles -- one a maniacal Hollywood star who wants an Oscar for making movies not films, and the other a naive, friendly neophyte who's sole objective is to do errands -- Eddie Murphy is completely credible. He shows his range while this film will show you a great time. Watch it! You'll be glad you did. 9/10.

Murphy is an outstanding actor (showcased as well in the Nutty Professor movies) and this role reinforced that fact.  The brothers look alike (obviously...) but the similarity ends there.  Murphy is incredibly talented, and Martin is his usual zany self.  This is one of the most creative and enjoyable movies I've seen.  Highly recommended!

When I saw it in the cinema, it seemed fairly average, and I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't that it was bad - all the actors played their parts perfectly - it somehow just didn't seem to gel as well as other Martin or Murphy films I'd seen. However, on watching the DVD last week (I bought it in a sale!), I was amazed by how much better it was this viewing. I laughed far more, even though I remembered most of the plot and the various scenes! Sometimes films are like that, I find the more you watch them, the funnier they get! Despite my earlier opinion to the contrary, this is definitely one of those films! I think maybe it's the characters that do it when you see the film the first time, you take a little while to work out who's who and what they're like as characters, but the second time you know all that, and it's then that you can appreciate such things as the characterisation, writing, and comedy timing.One thing I didn't understand was why they replaced the opening scene with a new version (the first version is included as an extra on the DVD), because I preferred the original! It seemed much funnier!Bizarrely, I could swear that the unused original version of the scene is the one I remember seeing at the cinema! I don't know if they perhaps used that one in UK cinemas for some reason (?).So, my simple message is that if you saw this in the cinema and thought it was average, or maybe heard it was average and didn't see it for that reason, try the DVD, and you may find that you agree with me that this is one of those slow burner films that are enjoyed more on repeat viewings than at the time it was originally shown.

In an age of gross-out situations, foul-mouthed jokes, bodily functions, and the audience's intelligence being insulted, BOWFINGER is a refreshing film. No foul language (with the exception of one moment early on that is said so quickly I didn't even hear it the first time around) and no gross-out humor, just good honest laughs and comical situations.Eddie Murphy is great as always, playing two parts, a famous movie star and his lookalike, and Steve Martin is watchable as always. This is one of both star's funniest films that I've seen. The rest of the cast is good, particularly Christine Baranski as the actress in the film. Heather Graham is hardly a great actress, but she does a surprisingly-good job here as well.I was surprised at how much I found myself laughing during this film, in all the right places, and never feeling embarrassed to be watching it with the whole family because of some gross joke that would pop up.

He has a stable of actors who work for him and trust that through him their careers will be realized (its unclear if his actors have other credits) and their dreams come true.  An even clearer example is the new-to-Hollywood character played by Heather Graham, who is not as naive as she initially appears.As this part of the movie is getting set up, the other part involves a self-doubting mega-movie star named Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy.  Kit is a little insecure, a little at odds with himself and his manager (Barry Newman) and the world around him. He is a member of MindHead, obviously a Scientology reference. He also has a fear of aliens and a deep love of the Laker Girls. How the two stories come together would be giving a lot away.  I do want to mention that Eddie Murphy is terrific in this movie.

At any rate, Steve Martin hasn't exactly been cranking out the movies Jackie-Chan-style lately. In Bowfinger, Martin plays the part of Bowfinger, a film producer/director with ridiculous taste in movies and who is hard up for material. And it's no wonder why he can't get his films financed, anyone who sees brilliance in a crapfest like `Chubby Rain' is not likely to be known for his keen eye for quality film. At any rate, some guy writes this crappy science fiction script and Bowfinger wants to film it, and he wants to have Kit Ramsey, the biggest action star of the time, star in it. When Bowfinger presents the script to Ramsey, he tries to lie to him to become friends, and when he is found out, Ramsey kicks him out of the limo and throws the script out as well. And thus, being the brilliant filmmaker that Bowfinger is (hey, he found this genius script, right?), he decides that he wants to make the movie anyway without Ramsey even knowing that he's in it, and even without his own actors knowing that Ramsey doesn't know he's in it.Kit Ramsey -, whose first name is creatively taken from a repeating phrase in his holistic therapy session, `Keep it together ' - is played, in a hilarious over the top performance, by Eddie Murphy, who fits the role very well except for the fact that he's not quite the action star that he used to be. His later films have been mostly comedies, and good comedies, at that. Heather Graham plays the part of the country girl from Ohio who wants to become a movie star, and she sleeps with everyone that she has to in order to get good scenes in the movie, and also to eventually get close to Ramsey.One of the funnier parts of this movie is the way that Bowfinger goes about the production of the movie, while trying to keep everyone from finding out that Ramsey really doesn't know that he's in it, as well as trying not to go over his shoestring budget. It seems that the only money that he has is a stash of dollar bills, because he has been putting away one dollar a week since he was seven years old, which is pretty impressive that he stuck with that, but it's also pretty sad that it's the only money that he has to his name in order to make this movie. At any rate, his star doesn't know that he's starring so he doesn't have to pay him, he hired a bunch of fugitive Mexican migrants for his crew, he sneaks onto his locations without a permit and works his way around the police, he even borrows nice cars (one of his crew is a valet) to use in the film so he won't have to pay for rentals.If nothing else, this movie gives some good ideas about how someone could make a movie with little to no money (Bowfinger has a little over $2,000, while the average Hollywood film has a budget of tens of millions), even though many of his ideas are not likely to work in real life. The irony of this film is that even though Chubby Rain is clearly a B-movie (you can tell by the purposely ridiculous acting and the idiotic story), it gets a standing ovation at the first screening at the end of the film. Ramsey's psychological and pathological problems and urges play a surprisingly significant role in the film, besides just making it funnier when he is approached by the actors, who deliver their lines about invading aliens to him, which terrifies him. Bowfinger is not the high caliber comedy that you might expect, especially given its cast, but it is an entertaining look at independent filmmaking with some occasional bits of great comedy, and of course, Eddie Murphy again showing his diversity as an actor by also playing the part of Kit Ramsey's geeky brother, who doubles for him in many scenes in the movie. This is below the standard of the people involved with the movie, but it is definitely worth a look.

However at moments, the film stretches the credibility of the situation a little too far,  especially when Kip's lookalike brother comes along and could have someone like Heather Graham walk in on their audition just like that. But apart from these examples of artistic licence ,the economy of plausibility doesn't ruin what was a very amusing 1 and a half hours. The independent director foiling a plot to make a movie against Hollywood's odds was full of Steve Martin's trademark offbeat wackiness, but the laid-back pace of the film doesn't quite deliver the Steve Martin witty wackiness quite as fast as features such as Father Of The Bride & Housesitter. If you like what is admittedly yet another take on Hollywood and have enjoyed films such as Get Shorty and Postcards From The Edge, then you will probably forgive the discrepanicies and the fact that when needed things come together just a little too conveninently.

When a terrific script (involving aliens) lands in his hands, Bowfinger finagles a green light from producer Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.), with one condition  action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) must be attached to the project.  Ecstatic, Bowfinger goes to work; he hires a cast and crew and everything is in place, except that Kit Ramsey will have nothing to do with him.  Not to worry; Bowfinger convinces the others involved that Ramsey is aboard, but the scenes with their star will have to be shot, well, without the star actually being there. 	Written by Steve Martin and directed by Frank Oz, `Bowfinger' is funny and entertaining.  Murphy has one of his best outings in years in the dual role of Ramsey and `Jiff,'  the hapless double Bowfinger gets to stand in for his star for the action sequences.  Heather Graham is Daisy, a young actress literally just off the bus from the Midwest who is hired by Bowfinger for a small part in his movie.  Daisy, however, we soon learn is anything but `just off the bus,' as she comically employs the traditional Hollywood behind-the-scenes politics to convert her bit part into a lead role.  Christine Baranski is Carol, the lead actress who rationalizes her way through Bowfinger's ridiculous explanations of why she is doing scenes without the participation of the lead actor; and Steve Martin shines as the opportunistic Bowfinger.   	With an able supporting cast that includes Barry Newman (Kit's agent), Terence Stamp (Terry), Jamie Kennedy (Dave) and Adam Alexi-Malle (Afrim), `Bowfinger' stays right on track and offers some memorable moments, including a running parody of Scientology, and an especially hilarious scene in which Jiff negotiates traffic while attempting to cross a busy freeway on foot.

You see, Steve Martin was never in Soul Man.Eddie Murphy has appeared on more than one occasion to be trading on past glories.

Unfortunately, director Frank Oz - responsible for IN AND OUT - has directed a film similar to that effort in that great things are expected, but only mildly amusing ones materialise.   still manages to deliver an exceptionally nice Hollywood satire, which is strange. The big question is is it funny? Kind of. You best rank it as Martin's best film of the nineties, that way you can sit on the fence.It promises self-parody but the material is restrained and neither star plays on their real personalities. There's more than a hint of bitterness in Graham's character. She's an awkwardly manipulated caricature, like the writer was hanging his dirty laundry out to dry in public. The end result is more embarrassing than funny.It could have been great or it could have been terrible but BOWFINGER ends up being neither the masterpiece its inspired premise suggests or a complete failure.

Put them together, and they can almost do no wrong.First, to truly understand the comedic genius that is Martin, see Either Planes, Trains and Automobiles or Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (where he plays the straight guy and the nutty guy respectively along side the late John Candy and Michael Cain). Nuff said.Murphy is quite arguably THE best actor in Hollywood. Murphy has made a career of playing multiple parts in a single film, and has that ability to maintain the consistency of each separate character within each film. From Coming to America, to The Nutty Professor, to Life, etc., you gotta love it.Now about Bowfinger.You've read all the other reviews, but I think I like most that Murphy's acting does not upstage Martin's main character and story. Both Murphy's characters are...um...interesting, but he doesn't overdo it to get in the way of Martin's character, which is a cookie-cutter character he plays often; even though it's standard Martin, it's still fun.The parody on Hollywood life is fun, from Robert Downy Jr.'s recollection of how he almost lost his dream car in his divorce in which he wasn't saddened to let his ex-wife get the kids, to star-spotting and chasing, following them as they try to live their private lives in public, to fringe wannabe directors manipulating to get opportunities, to the stereotyped mid-west strumpet sleeping her way to the screen...All in all, if you're looking to relax and have a laugh, thismovie will fit the bill.

Martin's latest effort however, is sufficiently character driven to avoid this.  'Bowfinger', like the aforementioned Allen picture, has to its credit numerous entertaining characters who enliven the screen with their charming idiosyncrasies.  And the cast do them justice, especially Martin as the title character, a director who'll stop at nothing to get his picture made.  In fact Martin always looks best at ease when working off his own material.  Meanwhile Murphy once again proves more than capable of pulling off a double role with hilarious flair, and Heather Graham is as sexy as ever as a promiscuous Hollywood debutant.Of course it's vital in any comedy that there be one or two memorably funny moments, and there are certainly a few hilarious set pieces on show here.  A scene where Murphy, as the film star's dim witted brother, dices with death on a busy freeway full of cars that Martin has falsely informed him are being driven by stunts extras, is particularly amusing.It's good to see Martin returning to his true form again and let's face it... it's been long overdue!

Heather Graham's delightfully over-the-top wannabe actress is perfect, and the other cast members do well in limited roles, though Terence Stamp can't seem to decide if he's doing an accent or not. One scene (the bit where Jiff starts on about how great everyone's been to him) threatens to introduce the gooey sentimentalism that has drowned a lot of Martin's recent work, but it's cut admirably short and the comedy is back on track from there.

With an equally ragtag band of idealists as his crew, this quixotic visionary hits upon an absurd scheme to bring his godawful action film script to fruition;  after it is handily rejected by Kit Ramsey, one of the hottest action stars in the business, Bowfinger concocts a scheme to film his screenplay AROUND the actor, plotting the man's every move, following him around town, and instructing his own amateur actors (who are oblivious to Ramsey's obliviousness) to jump out and act out their parts for the hidden cameras before an increasingly startled and distraught Ramsey.  This clever setup generates a considerable wave of comic energy that propels the story forward even though, like most films that rely heavily on a one-joke premise, the film does suffer a bit from the diminishing returns of repetition.  However, Martin's creative skills as both a writer and director keep the idea fresh for most of the film's running time.The film is blessed with an absolutely smashing comic performance by Eddie Murphy, who brings just the right note of both arrogance and anxiety to his portrait of a superstar whose internal insecurities and paranoia are hidden beneath a veneer of arrant egotism and aggressive despotism.  Murphy is less successful with his other role, that of a shy nerdish Ramsey look alike (he actually turns out to be Ramsey's brother) whom the crew is compelled to use as a stand in for the real star when the latter is driven to seek a rest cure to soothe his frazzled nerves, caused, ironically, by Bowfinger's own antics.  In all fairness to Murphy, however, in the character of Jiff, the actor has been given no solid center from which to build an effective comic performance.  As a writer,Martin has failed to really develop Jiff's purpose in the proceedings and the character seems tacked on mostly to give Murphy a chance to indulge in some weak displays of slack jawed buffoonery.Where the film does triumph is in the constant inventivenss of the situations, particularly the clever way in which Ramsey's paranoia dovetails so nicely with the absurdity swirling around him.  Martin has also cast a company of first-rate performers as the sharply delineated secondary characters who make up Bowfinger's never-say-die team.  Particularly wonderful are Heather Graham, whose character stumbles off a bus a naive young kid from Ohio, idealistically in search of quick stardom, who quickly learns to use her feminine wiles to enhance her starmaking opportunities, and Christine Baranski, whose over-the-hill and over-the-top method actress, determined come hell or high water to make an impression on the blithely unaware Ramsey, provides many of the genuine belly laughs in the film.Bowfinger lacks the keen societal and psychological insights of Martin's greatest film, LA Story, since it does tend to flail satirically at more obvious and less universal targets.  Nevertheless, Martin creates a tone of utter devil-may-care silliness that sparkles throughout the often quasi-slapstick proceedings.  Like any fine comedy, it envelops the audience in a world where just about anything can happen.  And Martin is filmmaker enough to make us want to come inside and be a part of it.

Don't tell him!","Date":"22 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  So here we have Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), a director whose career has seen far better days. In the opening scene he is finishing a read of a script he just KNOWS will make him a star. Before too long, Bowfinger's pitching the movie to the industry's #1 action star, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). Ramsey, of course, isn't too inclined to take on the project, and seems a little unbalanced himself. Seems he's seeing a therapist on the side who has been advising him to keep it together (Keep It Together = KIT - get it?). So since Kit won't do the project, and Bowfinger's already told his cast and crew he WILL do it, what's a forlorn director to do? That's right, shoot the movie without Kit knowing it! There are six scenes with Kit's character, so Bowfinger shoots all the others as normal, then has to use a little trickery to finish the others. At first he shoots them actually WITH Kit, although of course Kit has no idea he's being filmed; for closeup scenes, he auditions lookalikes for the part. The winner is a decidedly unstylish, non-suave dork named Jif (also played by Murphy, who's experienced at playing multiple roles). Of course, the resolution of this movie isn't tough to figure out - will Bowfinger get his movie in the can, with or without Kit knowing - but it's the getting to that resolution that's the real fun. Martin's a real treat as the over-the-top, get-this-movie-done-at-all-costs Bowfinger, and it's a role he absolutely plays to the hilt. And I doubt this movie would have been a big deal at all if Murphy wasn't cast in it. I've always enjoyed him when he does multiple roles, which he's done in several of his films, but the spins he put on both Kit and Jif were tremendous! I sincerely doubt any other actor could have pulled off the feat as well as Murphy did, and who knows - maybe it'll resuscitate his career. The script is crisp, and there are hardly any slackers in the entire cast. One of the best is the lovely Heather Graham, who has shown her acting chops (among other things) to us in Boogie Nights, Lost in Space, and Swingers, to name a few. Graham plays Daisy, a just-off-the-bus-from-Ohio naif who sleeps her way from the cameraman to the screenwriter to the director to make sure her scenes are in the film. Frank Oz is the director, but I don't think he had a lot to do with the overall success of the film. He's directed a few Steve Martin films before (Housesitter and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), and my instinct tells me that he kind of stepped back and let Martin and Murphy do their thing.

I recently did, and the movie was Bowfinger.  I don't mean ecstatic, this is the best I've ever seen fun, but basic enjoyment of a film.  First let me set the record straight.  I believe that Steve Martin is the funniest comedian out there, even funnier than (please don't hurt me for saying so) Adam Sandler.  Steve Martin's name on a movie always ensures some humor.  In this movie directed by Yoda and Fozzie voice Frank Oz, Mr. Martin (The Jerk, Father of the Bride) plays Bobby Bowfinger, a third-rate filmmaker.  He reads a script which he enjoys thoroughly, then goes looking for the cast and crew.  This leads him to popular actor Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop).  Kit is to play the lead in the film&#133;only he doesn't know it.  Filming is done in a very creative manner, where the actors go up to Kit whenever they can film him and read their lines to him, recording his reactions.  One of the actors is  Heather Graham playing the slightly friendly leading lady, Daisy.  Her character is nice to look at, but I got a little bit sick of her escapades (with 6 different people, I might add).   Anyway, over time, Ramsey starts getting scared of his surroundings, in which people come to him off the street and read strange lines to him.  Of course, he doesn't know he's being filmed.  Eventually, the stress gets to him and he needs to be sent away and Bobby is without an actor.  So he hires a lookalike geek (also played by Murphy) to play the part in some scenes (including the highway scene).  I was rather disappointed by the use of the geek.  The previews played him up to be a really important character, but really you see most of his scenes in the previews. The pace of the movie starts to pick up at this point, having good scenes such as Bobby setting up for a date with Daisy, the hot scene from the previews (You're doing great!), and an absolutely hilarious scene involving Kit again and the shooting of a sort of FBI agent.  This is where the movie starts its upward climb.	 	All in all, this was a pretty good movie.  It was played cool at times, and often over the top, but in the end it all flows together.  While Bowfinger may not be a potential classic (as Regis predicted), it certainly is a good way to spend a few hours of your time if you're in the vicinity of a theater.

And I don't mean that as a criticism at all, because it turns out to be really funny.Murphy plays both an action-movie star and his nerdy brother. The action-movie star bits use Murphy's patented loud-angry-black-man character, played to the hilt. The nerdy brother scenes, though, are something of a a shock THAT'S Eddie Murphy?

And it really is, don't get me wrong.  There are single scenes in Bowfinger that are funnier than entire movies.  And yet, it's also much more than that.It isn't surprising that Steve Martin wrote this wonderful script, because he's been inside Hollywood for a pretty long time.  He's seen the rise of Scientology, as well as the rise and fall of personalities.  He's seen characters like those portrayed in Bowfinger, and he makes them lovable and detestable at the same time.  He portrays them as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, and we're laughing the whole way.  There is, in my opinion, not a single dry moment in this movie.  It's funny, witty, and scorchingly satirical from start to finish.Steve Martin stars as Bobby Bowfinger, an out-of-work filmmaker who just wants a big break.  He thinks he sees it in Chubby Rain, and decides to go for it, no matter what.Which brings us to the actual star of Bowfinger, Eddie Murphy.  Murphy stars as two characters, and I mean that very literally.  He isn't one actor playing two similar guys, but his characters are each so distinct and definite.  It's a marvel to see Murphy weave two such original characters out of Martin's wonderful material.  Now, I ask you, why shouldn't Eddie Murphy be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar?  Comedians do not get enough credit, and I've always believed that.  For example, Jim Carrey should have at least been nominated for The Truman Show, but, dear me, he made us laugh, at least he used to, and we just can't have any of that, can we?  Eddie Murphy is, among other comedians, and outstanding actor, and he should be recognized as such.Bowfinger also features a host of other amusing characters.  Among them is the lovely Heather Graham, who makes a great follow up to her Austin Powers  The Spy Who Shagged Me.  Her character, Daisy, is determined to make it big, no matter what.  There are many others, of course, but theirs are not familiar faces as of yet, but they will be, sooner or later.Overall, Bowfinger is a wicked satire, a cunning comedy, and a chance for Eddie Murphy to really show what he can do.

Following on the logic of this amazingly absurd premise, the title of this movie is `Chubby Rain.'Strangely enough Bowfinger knows people willing to help him make a movie so bad it would even make Ed Wood cringe. There is Carol (Christine Baranski) a thespian prone to overacting and on the verge of having to give up Hollywood for a life of bit parts in places like Edmonton.There is Dave (Jamie Kennedy), an air-headed hunk, whose flatness as an actor is exceeded only by his sense of self-importance.There is Slater (Kohl Sadduth), a felon who wants to be a cameraman but is valued mostly for his knack for stealing cars.All Bowfinger needs is a leading lady and a leading man.As it turns out getting the leading lady is easy. In walks Daisy (Heather Graham), the proverbial girl-next-door who, no sooner than arriving in Los Angeles from Ohio, begins sleeping her way to the top.The challenge is getting the leading man. Bowfinger has his sights set on Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), an action-movie titan. But Bowfinger is so far down the Hollywood food chain that, as we soon find out, his chances of signing Ramsey to a contract are as about as good as the longevity of a snowball on a Malibu beach.But Bowfinger does not give up, and this is where the fun begins Bowfinger decides to make Kit Ramsey the star of the movie without him actually knowing that he is being filmed. It takes plenty of well-choreographed planning to get Bowfinger's actors into situations where they are interacting with Ramsey.Adding to the fun, Ramsey suffers from paranoid delusions which, when he's having a bad moment, cause him to honestly believe that the world really is being attacked by aliens. So when people he doesn't know run up to him and start screaming about invading space monsters, his mental balance goes a little whacky.The whole premise makes for plenty of great moments throughout the movie. And for a movie about non-actors, there is plenty of good acting. Murphy, for one, takes on two roles, the other being Kit's nerdy brother Jiff, who plays the role of Kit's butt in the Chubby Rain, while not out fetching the coffee.Baranski is hilarious as the actress `dedicated to the craft,' while Martin and Graham are perfect as the cad and caddess.There is also a nice touch when Bowfinger, in search of cheap labour, drives a van to the U.S.-Mexico border, opens the doors and simply waits for three illegal aliens to hop in. By the end of the show, they're well on the way to establishing themselves in the industry, making one wonder if we're not being a little tough on the recent arrivals from China. (For those of you not aware, five loads of boat people have arrived on the shores of British Columbia).Either way, Bowfinger, which was written by  Martin and directed by Frank Oz (What About Bob?, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Little Shop of Horrors), shows that among their other talents, these stars can pick a good script.

Murphy's resulting confusion, nay, complete mental breakdown over the course of the shoot in and around Hollywood provides most of the humor, with additional laughs supplied by Murphy in an endearing second role as the star's terminally geeky lookalike. Aiding Martin in his outrageous plot are Heather Graham as an ambitious starlet (in this case, rhymes with harlot) and Christine Baranski as the kind of aging tinsel-town doyenne who needs motivation to walk across a parking lot. Some critics have called this movie mean-spirited; it is anything but.

Although being rejected by Ramsey, Bowfinger decides to shoot the film anyway in order not to disappoint his friends and colleaugues but he still has the problem that Ramsey is not in on the project. Realising he only needs 19 or so scenes with Ramsey in the film he decides to follow Ramsey and contrive situations which he can put in the film. Eddie Murphy is entertaining as the highly strung actor who becomes increasingly paranoid as his co-stars approach him going about his daily life reciting strange dialogue about aliens. A nice subplot is that Ramsey belongs to an organisation called MindHead, which is an obvious (and hilarious) dig at Scientology. Terence Stamp is excellent as Ramsey's MindHead councillor.Robert Downey Jr appears briefly as a film exec. and Heather Graham is excellent as the initially sweet seeming but in fact ravenous wannabe actress. The film is not perfect, some jokes miss (as some do in most comedies), and I think you need to be more of an Eddie Murphy fan rather than a Steve Mertin fan.

It stars two comedy greats paired together, finally, to tell a satire of a producer resorting to desperate measures to make his dream film.  Steve Martin is at the top of his form here, playing a character so miserable and desperate for a hit, he would devise a clever scheme to have the biggest star in the world in his film without him knowing he's in it.  The star, hilariously played by Eddie Murphy, is Kit Ramsey, an insecure image-monger with a racial tip on his shoulder.  He's crazy enough to believe these strange encounters with the actors Bowfinger has assembled.  However, Murphy really shines as Jiff, an ultra-shy nerd with no acting experience that Bowfinger hires as a double for Kit.  The way Jiff is played, Murphy gets much sympathy from the audience because we would feel his pain if he knew his new friends that he loves and respects were using him.  The script, written by Steve Martin, is very witty and funny.  He knows how much people want to be in the movies and he uses his experiences and resources well here.  This is a major accomplishment for Martin and Murphy, one of the best films of both their careers.  Why didn't they make a movie together before?

It works in every way possible. At a time in American Cinema where most comedies are based on sex, crude or black humor, this film towers over all--providing many more laughs than Office Space Dumb and Dumber, and yes, even the inevitable There's Something About Mary. Bowfinger is one of the best films I have seen in a long while, and is worthy of your heart earned money.	The feature stars (and is written by) the wonderful Steve Martin, who couldn't excel above a few major road bumps in his other film this year The Out of Towners. That film had laughs, but this one has even more. It tells the story of a small time, struggling director Bobby Bowfinger, and his many adventures he and his film crew encounter as they try to hit big down the road of success. Bowfinger gets the chance at a green light picture called Chubby Rain if he can cast big time action star Kit Ramsey. One problem Kit doesn't want to star in the movie. 	What to do now? Lie. Bowfinger explains to his crew, including Daisy, who thinks she can sleep her way to the top of Hollywood, that Kit will do the movie, but secretly plans on shooting Kit' scenes without his knowledge. Far fetched, but some major laughs evolve, and smartness permits.Things go well, the actors go up to Kit, act out their roles and recite their lines to him, and follow the script. Kit is soon finding this very strange; wired people come up to him calling him Keith, and shout things at him about aliens taking over the world. Wouldn't you find this a bit on the odd side too.Soon, however, Kit is off to his psychiatrist for a few days, leaving Bowfinger and his crew to only dream about finishing this production. But wait! He has to have a look alike or two out there. How about a real nobody named Jiff, who thinks it is wonderful that he can be a delivery boy and get any item from here to there. He gets the part, but can't act very well, and many times he breaks down in laughter, especially when he shoots a scene where Daisy takes off her blouse.  (spoiler) The funny thing, Jiff turns out to be the brother of Kit.	The film's funniest scenes usually happen when the story is most successful. This movie has hilarious potential without its big comic stars because the plot is so amazing and laughter rich in itself. The things that happen are outstandingly funny. It induces audience participation the whole way though.  Like The Out of Towners, this movie has many kinds of humor contained the odd couple, slapstick, sight gags, witty one liners, inside jokes, sex-orientated, physical and the dumb and dumber type are all present--giving the viewer a selection to laugh at. You see, if, for instance, someone disliked the sexual humor, but enjoyed physical humor, this movie would still appeal to them. 	The film is directed by the great Frank Oz, who has hit big before with the also comical What About Bob, and recently flopped with In and Out. He has a of turning humiliation and personal tragedy into comedy.  He also has contributed his voice to movies like Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace, and Muppets From Space, both which failed during the course of the summer. This is a man of many talents, and I look forward to seeing his next feature film.Bowfinger is a smart, sassy, witty little production that offers more laughs than one can handle in the course of its running time. This is one of the years best films, with my only complaint being the shallowness of a few of its characters. Bowfinger is a movie masterpiece, and in its closing when alas, Bowfinger watches his film, Chubby Rain, he remembers all the work he has put into it, all the troubles he has faced, and all the wonders he has achieve, as we see his face lit by the reflecting projector light which glows with ease and wonder. The comedy is gone and meaning permits. At that point, Bowfinger has achieved his life's goal, and we fully realize his emotions. Scenes like this are why Bowfinger is one of the reasons why I love the movies.

It HAS to be good! But thats how they suck you in!Don't get me wrong. Bowfinger is not a bad film, its just not that good either. Mainly, I felt cheated since everybody on TV was singing the high praises of this film.In particular is Jay Leno of NBC's The Tonight Show. Whenever he'd have a cast member from Bowfinger on his show, he would bring up what he called the funniest scene in any summer movie this year. Said scene is Eddie Murphy running frantically on a freeway. While I did find this scene amusing, I would hardly call it the funniest in any summer movie this year. Take basically any scene in South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut or American Pie, and they're still about ten times more funnier than that scene.At least the basic plot of the film is simple to grasp. Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is a pathetic excuse for a film maker who opperates out of a run down shack. He's about to give up, until a fantastic screenplay comes across his desk. Unfortunatly, he doesn't have much money, so he hires some friends to star in it, and in order to get it distributed, he has to somehow get the hottest film star in the world, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to star in it. Naturally unable to do so, he and his crew simply follow Ramsey around with the camera and have their stars approch him with their lines, basically freaking him out. To patch up the gaps in the film, Bowfinger hires a small town actress named Daisy (Heather Graham), and a nerdy Kit Ramsy look-alike named Jiff (Murphy, in a duel role), who have some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, (Bowfinger, not the one in the movie, don't get confused). However, that's not saying much.All in all, Bowfinger is a decent movie, but if you can see anything better this summer, like Mystery Men or American Pie, you should see those instead.Overall 2 1/2 Stars "},{"Title":"There were 2 scenes alone that were worth the price of admission.","Date":"30 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Eddie Murphy was excellent and really helped carry this movie.

He works with a devoted group of equally down-on-their-luck actors, headlined by the brilliant Christine Baranski. Desperate to make a film, he devises a scheme to use the hot action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) without Ramsey actually being in the film. To say much more would give the laughs away, but a dog in high heels, spoofs on Scientology, Heather Graham's innocent (or is she?) actress just of the bus from Ohio, and Martin's terrific spoofing of Hollywood, all combine for one funny ride.

After obvious years of struggling, Bowfinger discovers a script written by his accountant and falls in love with the plot. Gathering his band of actors, and his writer the accountant, Bowfinger goes after some production company support, only to find that his only chance to get the movie produced is to have a big star signed on. The big star Bowfinger goes after is none other than Kit Ramsey, played wonderfully by Eddie Murphy. Ramsey refuses to consider doing the movie, leaving Bowfinger with only one option; to film Ramsey in the movie without Ramsey knowing it. What is left is a very witty, always enjoyable plot that never slows down.Martin is wonderful as the hapless Bowfinger and shows the characters unwaivering desire to make his movie at all costs. As usual there is a sweetness to a Steve Martin character, and while Martin could have choosen to spoof the uncaring, apathetic movie producer to a tee, he instead chose to give Bowfinger a very sensitive side to counteract the characters manipulative actions. You can't help but fall in love with Bobby Bowfinger, and a movie that gets you caring about its characters has won half the battle.Heather Graham, who plays the not so innocent Daisy, is good as the pure looking Ohio beauty who secretly will sleep with anyone to get to the top. She is not spectacular, while her appearance as usual is, but she holds her own in scenes with both Martin and Murphy, which is something not to many people could do. Christine Baranski plays the part of Carol, the over the top actress who stars in Bowfingers movie, to perfection and her comedy, I believe, unfortunately will be lost in the totality of the movie. I wish Martin had given her more lines, more parts, and more opportunities to show her talents because she is one of the better comedic actress's out there today.This movie, however, belongs to Eddie Murphy. Somewhere down the road, in the fog of action movies and record deals, many people forgot what a true comedy genius Murphy is. Names like Martin and Brooks and Allen are thrown around in the comedy circles as the deities of the profession, but Murphy is as good, and more talented than all of them. Those talents have been on diplay more these last few years, with the Nutty Professor coming out, but no where does Murphy shine more than in Bowfinger. His ability to create two equally wonderful and funny characters, so distinctly different from one another, is truly amazing. As Kit Ramsey, Murphy shows us the paranoid, racist, sometimes schizophrenic action star who relys on the cult religion of Mind Head to get him through life. Murphy is wonderful as Ramsey and while the character is made to be disliked, one can't help but truly like Ramsey all throughout the film.His true genius comes through in Jiff, the super dorky Burger King worker who Bowfinger highers to double as Ramsey and to run errands. Never has Murphy, in my opinion, created such a funny character as Jiff. With his nerdy glasses and his straightforward tone, Jiff is an absolute gem and provides the funniest moments in the film. The scene on the highway, which unfortunately has been shown at nauseum on T.V., is still a comedy classic and every moment Jiff is on the screen the audience is laughing. It shows Murphy at his best, which is always a beautiful sight to behold.This movies works because it is fun. It never takes itself seriously, never takes its characters seriously, and never expects the audience take anything seriously. There is no hidden message in Bowfinger, only the message that film is suppose to entertain, and this one definitely did. Martin never fails to make films people enjoy for many years after, and Bowfinger should be no different.

As such, the film seems completely ineffective as a satire of anything; hampered both by its fragmented structure and by the rather enigmatic nature of Martin's own character he doesn't have the blindly basement-happy fervour of Ed Wood, but nor does he have any real aesthetic sense - so what does his ultimate success represent other than a cold, calculating commerce?

Eddie was outstanding in this picture because he pokes fun at his own image as a the premier action/actor. He is cocky and has a certain swagger but then as he starts to lose his senses he loses it in such a believable way.  And Eddie as Jif was incredible.  If you closed your eyes and listened to Kit and Jif's voice you would have no idea they came from the same actor. Eddie did a great job handling both characters and did not go over the top.  If any members of the Academy are out there surfing, PLEASE NOMINATE EDDIE for a best supporting actor nod. I'm not saying he should win but he is certainly deserving of this recognition.

He proved adept at this with the decent L.A. STORY in 1991, but here he takes it to a rampant, more delirious level.  It is reminiscent of his early humor from the 70's. Having written BOWFINGER, he also could not have come up with a better idea to cast Eddie Murphy as a head-case movie star.  Murphy is a comedic weapon in this picture which has a laugh in almost every scene either because of Murphy's antics or because of what Martin and company are doing to him.  A movie is being made starring Murphy's character Kit Ramsey, but he has no idea what the hell is going on.Martin paints the town once again with some familiar gags and rips, especially at the religious mind-set of many stars in Hollywood. MindHead is probably a stab at scientology, which so many of the actors and producers take part in out there.  Kit Ramsey reminded me of Martin Laurence in real life, sort of a manic personality.  Murphy no doubt takes liberty with the material and creates his first genuinely funny character since Axel Foley. It is good to see him pairing up with the likes of Martin and seeing the true comic genius that has always existed within Murphy.  BOWFINGER is a huge departure from his recent star vehicles, most of which disappoint.Steve Martin turns in an equally sensational slapstick performance as low-budget director Bowfinger with a hint of do or do not, there is no try.  You will be reminded of ED WOOD during many scenes because of this mad cracker of a director, who will stop at nothing to get his flimsy film made (even if it includes carrying a very unusable cell phone and shooting footage of security screens capturing the story he is trying to make). Director Frank Oz keeps the pace relentless and the chuckles plentiful as a new revelation halfway through extends Murphy's ability to make us laugh.It turns out there is a Kit Ramsey look-alike out there and Martin and the gang audition him to be an errand boy and to showcase his butt as a stand-in for Ramsey.  This character is even funnier than the original and the film's best scene has this awe-struck, goofy loser (also played by Murphy) running across a busy L.A. highway risking life and limb and braces. Heather Graham is an effective caricature of the dumb blondes who supposedly get off a bus every day in California and ask Where do I become a star?.  There is more to her than meets the eye and she seems to have a good idea of how to get what she wants.BOWFINGER is not exactly original.  We have seen this before in GET SHORTY and the aforementioned ED WOOD.  This film may be superior because the characters are so hilarious and the story spares us nothing that you cannot help but laugh.  It is an uproarious comedy with a sometimes tender side that brings Eddie Murphy back into cinema form and has the viewer stomping and spitting popcorn with BIG laughs.

Since the film is so average, so Hollywood, I'd like to point out how it portrays women and minorities.  The only two women in the movie are actresses.  None of them work on the production of the movie.  Heather Graham has to have sex with everyone to get to the top, but we are actually led to dislike her because she screws over some of the sympathetic characters.  Isn't she a heartless bitch! says the viewer.  Eddie Murphy is the big star, but he is portrayed as paranoid, foolish, aggressive, and is always surrounded by a posse.  What a typical rich black guy says the viewer never appreciating all we have given him.  Some of the crew are Mexicans just over the border.  They are being shot at when Martin recruits them. Well, at least we were shooting at them and not just letting them in says the viewer.  By the way, this can be done with almost any major studio production and is the end effect of a system where all the decisions are made and all the art carried out by middle-aged white men.

Christine Baranski is a great melodramatic actress seeking the part that will put her back on top.

He finds his script, now he has to bend over backwards, do a few flips in mid-air, and get the hottest actor in Hollywood (Murphy) to play his leading man. When all plans are flushed, Martin gets the next best thing... a look-a-like. This nerdy kid (Murphy) not only brings his looks, but power for the making of the movie as well. If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Jiff (Murphy) is the one scratching Bowfinger's back, and as it strangely turns out Bowfinger (Martin) is more than happy to scratch Jiff's back.

He's a person who wants to direct a movie.  A successful movie, that will not only make him a lot of money, but famous.  I can understand that, I too am a struggling director-to-be that wants to make a successful and good movie.  Then Bowfinger comes across a script that his Iranian accountant wrote titled, Chubby Rain.  Bowfinger believes that this can be a good movie but wants to be sure that it's a green-lighted picture. Bowfinger takes the script to a studio executive (Robert Downey Jr.) who sarcastically tells Bowfinger that if he gets Hollywood's biggest action star, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), then he has himself a go picture.  This makes the hard on luck Bowfinger happy, who then tries to pitch the idea to Ramsey while riding in his limo, ten seconds later, Ramsey throws Bowfinger out of his limo.  So what is Bowfinger to do? He  tells his also struggling cast and crew that Ramsey wants to make the picture.  So in a Steve Martin way (which is usually witty), he decides to make the film around Ramsey's life.  Which has funny results.  Then Ramsey freaks out, and hides, so Bowfinger gets a nerdy look-alike of Ramsey, named Jiff (also played by Eddie Murphy) to do the long shots and scenes that don't require Ramsey's face to be shown. I'm guessing that people are going to be expecting a laugh-a-minute comedy like AMERICAN PIE and BIG DADDY out of BOWFINGER, well, it isn't.  AMERICAN PIE had a strong opening, as well as a strong follow-up.  BIG DADDY had a strong first-half, and a sensitive by the end.  BOWFINGER starts off a little slow, then it builds and builds up to a funny climax. I'll admit, that BOWFINGER isn't for everybody.  It requires more than one viewing, especially for understanding the jokes.  But once you understand the jokes, it's a nice treat.  It's a brilliant satire on the look of the film industry and the Hollywood life-style.  Martin not only hit his mark with the L.A. lifestyle with L.A. STORY, but also on BOWFINGER as well.  And personally, I would rather watch another satire look on L.A. by Steve Martin, than a satire on New York City by Woody Allen.   Martin does a good job with both his writing and his acting.  He is at his best since L.A. STORY with his witty and troubled role of the director.  And Eddie Murphy?  Well, I would put this film up there on his good film list along with NUTTY PROFESSOR, BEVERLY HILLS COP (the first one only), TRADING PLACES, and COMING TO AMERICA.  BOWFINGER shows that Eddie Murphy is a misunderstood excellent talent.  First there's his role of the Hollywood celebrity, a person that hates the scripts that are offered to him, and regularly vistis his Free Mind, New Age like sessions.  Then there's the scene stealing role of Jiff.  A role that makes Murphy shine, and shows that he's one of the most talented comedians out there.  All Jiff wants to do is to deliver things, and make people happy. Leave it to Frank Oz (WHAT ABOUT BOB? LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, and IN & OUT) to direct this witty satire, and adapts Steve Martin's witty script into a equally witty film.  I enjoyed all of the Hollywood inside jokes.  It's the funnest take on Hollywood that I have seen since Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, and hopefully Albert Brooks' THE MUSE will be just as witty and funny.  And I am also glad to see a witty satire take on the New Age religion with the so-called Mind Head, where they are more concerned about a person's income, than a person. I'm waiting for Tom Cruise and John Travolta to start protesting against this film. And by the end of BOWFINGER, is shows us why people want to go into the movie business, and I was personally touched when I saw this. It showed the reason on why I want to go into the filmmaking business as well, and that I am not the only one who also shares that dream.  I would highly reccommend BOWFINGER to the following people  Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy fans; people who want to go into the film business; intelligent people (the same ones who like EYES WIDE SHUT); and those who know how movies are made and love to watch them. For those who want a brain-dead comedy, then go stand in the AUSTIN POWERS 2 line again, you won't get that kind of juvenile humor here.  In the end, I didn't walk out of BOWFINGER laughing, I walked out with a smile on my face.  And with that smile, I give BOWFINGER  ****1/2 (out of five) stars.

With a few small tweaks in the script, BOWFINGER could've been another TRUMAN SHOW.  Instead what we get looks like an above average movie-of-the-week.Still, it is a funny attempt at times.

The fact that it both smart and hysterically funny makes it even more appreciated. It is nice to see a funny movie that does not have any American Pie or There's Something About Mary type of humor (not that I mind that in a movie). I also thought this was going to be like The Nutty Professor. It's not; it is after all, a Steve Martin film.Now that you know what it is not about, what is it about? Basically, Steve Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, a wannabe Hollywood Producer. He has a fledgling movie company, Bowfinger Films International. His accountant, Afrim, gives him a script that he wrote and Bowfinger falls in love with it and vows for it to be their first movie. Without revealing too much, it gets to the point where in order to get the film distributed, he needs to have Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), a Will Smith/Arnold Schwarzenegger type in his film. Of course, someone of that status doesn't want to be in a low budget feature like Bowfinger's. Bowfinger decides to make the movie with Ramsey anyway with only one catch He won't know he's being filmed. Bowfinger has all the actors run up to Bowfinger at certain places and say their lines to him. That is the premise of the film, and the scenes they create are hilarious.This movie is about making movies and Martin takes a few jabs at his industry. Some of the humor in this film works better if you have an understanding of the movie industry. This movie is not all about sight gags and things like that. I was expecting that when Murphy played the role of the dork that it would be very funny. The funniest parts were when Murphy was in the Kit Ramsey role and reacting to Bowfinger's stream of actors running up to him. The movie is not all laughs, but the parts that you do are extremely hilarious. This is the Summer of 1999's smart comedy. See it if you would like that. I did.  "}{"Title":"not quite great, but very funny","Date":"16 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I've got an odd reaction to this movie.  I laughed almost all the way through it and had residual chuckles within the hour or so after, but I can't say that this is a great movie, however effective it is.  Like L.A. STORY it has its charm, portrays people -- even its targets -- with a certain decency, has a somewhat inventive story, and eventually comes off as a mild, pleasant movie, if not exactly an achievement.It's certainly very funny and I don't want to give anything away, so avoid this paragraph if you want not even the hint of a spoiler.  Okay, here we go a scene in a parking garage and the click of high heels is wonderful and provides a concrete context for a wonderfully surreal image; Jiff crossing the highway is very funny and tense (and the punchline is ironic, as its the only time we see Bowfinger ask for a second take).  The highway scene also supplies a wonderful how-the-heck did they do that? bit of stuntwork and masterful editing.The film has a couple of spots which, while not exactly deadly to the pace, certainly slowed things down the brief romantic evening Bowfinger has is the main culprit, though his own duplicity (first the wine innocent enough, then the credit card whoa!) adds a certain spin.Eddie Murphy surprised me in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, so I was prepared this time, and I think this is an even better performance.  In PROFESSOR, Murphy's Buddy Love didn't work for me at all, but the professor was wonderful.  Here, Murphy's Jiff is a marvel, and the action star Murphy plays is -- flamboyant paranoia notwithstanding -- more believable than his previous Buddy Love.  It's tough to say, because the exaggerated personality, paranoia, fetishes and quirks make the action star in BOWFINGER a little unreal anyway, whereas Jiff's character is generally rooted in reality.  Murphy plays him with honesty, sweetness, and no condescension. As the gang sits around at a restaurant and Jiff expresses gratitude that the troupe likes him just for being himself, the film's emotional core deepens, if only for a while, and for a few scenes the movie has nearly lifted to a new level, like the best of Sturges' comedies have done.  The penultimate scene in the theater is supposed to do that as well, methinks, and it comes close.I wish the casting had been uniformly strong.  Martin is okay -- I've never thought he was much of an actor, but sometimes he manages something besides his superb physical comedy -- but characters like the young hunk don't ring properly true.  For instance, the girl who plays the nymph is a bad actress, but in the scenes in which she plays real life, she is completely convincing.  In the hunk's real life scenes, he is only a little less phony than when placed before Bowfinger's camera.Overall, I would recommend the movie as a fun matinee ticket which will deliver some genuine laughs without insulting the audience.  It has memorable moments -- the ones listed above, Bowfinger explaining that all movies are made for $2000, the deepening eroticism of the kiss between the young couple during casting (and Bowfinger's discomfort and subsequent punchline)  -- but probably won't last in the public's memory or cinema's.Maybe I'm expressing too many reservations for a movie I genuinely enjoyed; perhaps I'm also expecting too much from Steve Martin's pen.  Like Albert Brooks, his pieces have a certain dependability and quality.  So far, Brooks has managed only one film which could be argued to be a masterpiece (DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, not the way-overrated LOST IN AMERICA); I'm looking forward to seeing Steve Martin hit one out of the park as well.

More importantly, I was hoping that it was going to be the movie that Eddie Murphy finally breaks out of his acting slump. It's been a long time since I've seen Murphy do a truly funny movie and I can happily say that he's finally done it.The movie revolves around Steve Martin's character, Bobby Bowfinger, a down and out small time movie director hoping to find that one script that will launch him into director stardom. He finally finds a script that he believes is 'the one' and proceeds to put together the best filming crew and cast that $2000 can buy, which is needless to say, a hodgepodge of people. His one trump card is Kit Ramsey (Murphy), the movie industry's biggest action hero actor. With him, the movie is a guaranteed success. But unfortunately Ramsey refuses to do the movie. Bowfinger then decides that he can shoot the movie with Ramsey in it by filming around the actor's daily life without him knowing. Along the way, Bowfinger meets up with Jifferson and decides to use Jifferson as Kit's double for some of the shots. The rest of the story I'll leave to you to see.This movie definately belonged to Eddie Murphy. The first part of the story, we meet Murphy as Kit Ramsey. He plays Ramsey as a paranoid actor that will do anything, including belonging to a religious cult, to solve his paranoia problems. His fast talking, loud brash character is amazingly funny but his true talents shine as he plays the dim-witted Jifferson. His ability to play Jifferson as an incredibly sweet but naive character makes Jifferson all that more endearing and unbelievably funny. Steve Martin is his usual crazy self and provides a few laughs but Murphy is definitely the attention getter.Despite the great performance by Murphy, there were some rough spots though. At times, it felt that Martin's writing and directing was trying to be too smart. There's no doubt that he is an intelligent man and that he was obviously poking fun at a variety of aspects of the Hollywood life but in some of the situations, it almost felt like he was trying to make too subtle of a statement. This resulted in some parts that were rather slow or dull. The beginning took a little while to get into and to some audiences, this may start them off on the wrong foot.Overall, ride out the slow points and enjoy Eddie Murphy's best performance in years.

At first, I thought my fears were confirmed, since the first five minutes of the film really does not have that many laughs... but after the first five minutes, I began laugh, and after about fifteen minutes of laughing, my stomach began to hurt, and it really did not stop until the end of the movie. As I write this, I have just gotten home from seeing it, and my stomach is still sore. This is just great comedy. It is one of the most original comedies that I have ever seen. Nothing is really borrowed, and all of the jokes work (well, maybe not all...).Eddie Murphy did a great job of bringing laughs to the screen as the paranoid action star Kit Ramsey and the nerdy fast food worker Jiff. Whenever he played the character Jiff, most people in the theater were almost bawling with laughter. Steve Martin's character, Bowfinger, is less funny, and is more of the straight man, but Martin plays him well also. Then there is Daisy, played by Heather Graham, who sleeps with all the main male characters to get to the top... she does a good job also (she does a lot of great wiggling....). The rest of the actors fulfill their characters well. What surprised me was seeing Terrence Stamp as the leader of a hilarious religious enterprise very similar to Scientology, called MindHead.This movie is great; I have not laughed this hard since I last saw Monty Python's Meaning of Life. I do not think that I have seen a comedy as original as this one for a while. Frank Oz and Steve Martin made a good team at bringing this movie to life. However, I did not laugh at a few scenes. One was a scene with a few racial jokes. Is it just me, or are racial jokes just not funny? Although I admit they are better timed and placed that in Wild Wild West, and in character, but they still made me uncomfortable. The other was a funny scene at first, but after I thought of it, it was not so funny. The scene shows a bunch of Mexicans trying to run for the border while the Border Guards are shooting at them. Bowfinger then herds some of them into his van to use as film crew. That seemed like it trivialized what they go through. However, besides that, Bowfinger is the best comedy of the year. Forget that teen comedy garbage and see this. Be sure not to eat too much before you see it though, or you might actually bust your gut.**** stars (out of *****)  "},{"Title":"Another El Lay Movie","Date":"14 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The story is not the most original, and there are a lot of L.A. industry and culture jokes.

First, the movie was just as funny (if not funnier) than I thought it would be. It is a smart comedy that doesn't need to insult the intelligence of its audience or resort to flatulence humor (not that a well-placed fart joke can't be funny) in order to entertain. Secondly, I was relieved to see that Steve Martin hasn't lost his comic touch. Not that I was so much worried about that one. His book Pure Drivel was incredibly funny. I have been a longtime fan of Martin and I am pleased to see that he just keeps growing as an actor and getting funnier with age. Finally, I was relieved to see Eddie Murphy give a performance that reminded me why I ever thought he was funny to begin with. This is easily the funniest role(s) Eddie has had since I don't know when. His fast-talking, paranoid turn as Kit Ramsey is a scream, which makes his performance as the shy, honest Jiff all the more astounding. That he could give two performances so diametrically opposed in the same movie is a testament to his skill as a comic actor. For fans of Martin or Murphy, I have but this to say SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

He is also excellent as Kit, the movie star with the hyper-inflated ego.Steve Martin is very good as the lead, and another highlight performance comes from Heather Graham, who is infinitely better here than in Austin Powers 2.  The cast is rounded out well, though I can't imagine how hard it would be that hard for an actor to play an actor looking for work.The script is well-written, with only one weak point, Kit's Mind-Head organization, which gets a little confusing.

"},{"Title":"Very funny","Date":"13 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The last three movies Steve Martin has written - ROXANNE, L.A. STORY, and A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE - were all based on what we think of as classics. ROXANNE, of course, a modern day romantic comedy version of CYRANO DE BERGERAC, L.A. STORY was inspired by HAMLET, and A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE was a modern version of SILAS MARNER.  For BOWFINGER, however, Martin goes to a classic showbiz story; that of a guy on the fringe hoping for his one big break.  Another contrast; while those three films had some big laugh moments in them(like in L.A. STORY when we realize the message the freeway sign is spelling out), we remember them more as films which make us smile and feel warm without feeling cheap(whereas, in my humble opinion, the FATHER OF THE BRIDE movies make you feel cheap).  BOWFINGER, on the other hand, is a laugh out loud comedy like his earlier works such as ALL OF ME and DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS.If I think ROXANNE and L.A. STORY are better films, it's not because I don't appreciate the laugh out loud movies, it's just that those two are better made.  BOWFINGER has a few too many slow spots, and it's not the masterpiece you'd expect from the teaming up of Martin and Eddie Murphy.  Still, there are some huge laughs to be had here, like when Murphy tries to cross the L.A. freeway.  And Martin has a lot of affection for his characters, so you're always laughing with them as well as at them.  Also, it must be said Murphy delivers one of his funniest performances.  Everyone is raving about his portrayal of the sweet if clueless Jiff, but I also liked his paranoid Kit and his mantra of Keep it together.I always like Heather Graham and Christine Baranski, and it's nice to see them here; they play stock characters(and using Imani Coppola's Legend of a Cowgirl is not, shall we say, the most subtle way of introducing Graham's character), but play them for all they're worth.  And Terrence Stamp is a hoot as Kit's new age guru.  All in all, very funny.

In this movie, he's at the top of his game.The sequence when Nerdy Burger Boy Jiff (played by Murphy) has to run across a freeway is one of the best-engineered comedy routines on film. I literally find myself aching with laughter as Jiff courageously negotiates highspeed cars, bikes and trucks, contorting his body in an afford to remain in one piece! (In fact, I wonder how they managed to film this sequence, since it looks so realistic!) The essence of great comedy is, unfortunately, other people suffering. (Not real suffering - acted suffering - due to comically-engineered situations). Laurel & Hardy knew this. Keaton and Chaplin knew this. Murphy and Martin know this. Without missing a beat, Bowfinger (played with aplomb by Martin) asks Jiff for one more take. The real director (Oz) decides on just a few seconds of close-up as Jiff dashes across the lethal freeway oncemore. Looking at Murphy's tortured face is an achingly funny moment.But the laughs don't stop. Bowfinger amounts to a deliciously wicked satire of Hollywood's many shortcomings. Unhinged superstars, Mexican film crews and desperate starlets are all ruthlessly parodied for our entertainment. This is intelligent comedy and I appreciated its subtlety in every chuckle-inducing frame.If you feel down, I'm certain Bowfinger will supply the antidote.

There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and they linger long after the film has ended. I found myself randomly chuckling at the memory of the some of the scenes. Frank Oz has done a brilliant job here. I liked how he stays on track and doesn't go outrageously overboard with his plot devices, like his realistic use of the Kit-look-a-like. Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Christine Baranski, Jamie Kennedy, Adam Alexi-Malle and Heather Graham form an excellent and hilarious team. They're all spot on in their delivery. Graham's Daisy echoes the stereotype of a small town girl doing anything to influence the cast and crew to climb the ladders of stardom and Baranski's Carol echoes that of a has-been who has managed to remain dignified without resorting to tragedies like alcoholism or drugs.

It just keeps getting better and better no matter how many times you do it. You may get sick at the end from too much of it, but it's a fun ride while it lasted. A movie with just enough ice cream without getting sick is Bowfinger, a low-key comedy from the minds of on-off director Frank Oz (who's responsible for the genius Little Shop of Horrors and the idiotic The Stepford Wives) and the always great Steve Martin (well, not always great-he was in Cheaper by the Dozen). It's always on key, en route to greatness, and barely gets bogged down by sentimentality.Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) is a filmmaker who has fallen on hard times. He has a few constant actors at his helm, including Carol (Christine Baranski) and Dave (Jamie Kennedy). He gets a script for a horror movie called Chubby Rain, and is able to make it if they can get huge action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) in the picture. Kit refuses, but Bowfinger and co. film around Kit so he doesn't even know he's in it. Kit has his own mental troubles, including delusions of paranoia and exposing himself to the Lakers cheerleaders. Meanwhile, Kit look-alike Jif (also Murphy) is hired for a stand-in. Of course, things soon get out of hand.Put simply, Bowfinger is a hilarious movie. Martin hits a home run again with this movie. Considering he wrote it also, he knew exactly how to do each line, and his almost dead-pan performance fit into the humor of the role. Murphy plays two very different roles here, both to perfection. Kit is almost like Chris Rock in one of his movies, while Jif is at the completely different end of the spectrum. He's a low-key guy, and Murphy did a great job with that character. All of the other actors added to the humor of the script. There's not really much more to say about Bowfinger except that it's very funny.

There are slapstick elements to keep the multiplexes happy, and understated in-jokes for the cinephiles. Examples The wetback crew members are seen to be reading Cahiers du Cinema in a two-sided joke referencing guerilla film-making and the ambitious self-education of immigrants; MindHead is a parody of the Church of Scientology and Heather Graham's character takes up with one of Hollywood's most influential lesbians in what I assume is a pop at Martin's ex-girlfriend Anne Heche. I also like the moment in the opening scene where the background song reaches the lyric don't walk out on me and Martin's dog leaves the room.For me the film's weakness was in the ending, the Ninja parody went on *way* too long, and the enthusiastic reception for Chubby Rain was off the mark - it would have been so much better to have the premiere audience boo the film and the cast and crew go home depressed until they get the wonderful news about the Z-movie offer from Taiwan.

So, Bowfinger decides to follow Kit around and make the film with him in it, without him knowing it.  Funny as a Steve Martin/Frank Oz directed film can get, this film looks at a type of Ed Wood guy trying to make it big.  Though Martin is funny with his cast of characters, the funniest part of the movie is Eddie Murphy who plays 2 characters.  One is Kit Ramsey, the loud-mouth, narcasistic and crazy action mpovie star who gives laughs while being chased by fake aliens.  The other is Jif Ramsey, a twin brother of Kit who is shy, clumsy and funny as can be who only wants to run errands to boost his career.  This brings the film to such funny heights.  Martin hasn't made this good of a film since 3 Amigos, or even the Jerk.  Favorite line Bowfinger- Did you know Tom Cruise didn't know he was in that vampire movie until 2 years after it came out?.

Steve Martin wrote and stars in this improbable story of a director who attempts to make a movie around a superstar actor who doesn't know he is in it.  The director, Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) creates scenes and plays them out with the unwitting Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) on the streets of Hollywood with cameras rolling.Basically the script was narcissistic with Martin writing himself a ticket to play a character only he could play.  Ironically, though this was more or less the Steve Martin show, Eddie Murphy stole the entire movie.  Once again, Murphy plays two completely divergent characters; superstar Kit Ramsey and his nerdy brother Jiff.  While Martin attempts to be funny by playing someone absurd trying to be serious, Murphy plays one over the edge paranoid ego maniac and a self conscious geek and gets the majority of the laughs.  Give Steve Martin credit for having the guts to bring in talent that could overshadow him.Frank Oz does a good job of making filmmaking look like what we think it must be like and nothing like what it really is.  I think most people think filmmaking is like filming the news; you go in take some shots and leave.  The reality is that 90% of shooting a movie is setup, lighting, marks, stunt coordination, etc., to say nothing of post production.  The actual filming is the smallest element of the project.  Heather Graham makes great window dressing as the naive Ohio girl ambitious to become a movie starlet, having sex with anyone and everyone she thinks might help her career.  Her unusual combination of sweetness, sexiness and gawkishness made her the perfect choice for her character.I gave this movie a 6.

Every week he puts a dollar away into a little tin to save up for his first movie. Well, now he has bills up to here and debts to pay, and some promising actors to satisfy with a script. And he's got the perfect script to make it all come true `Chubby Rain.' It is about aliens coming down from space in raindrops, hence the name `Chubby Rain.' And Bobby Bowfinger has the perfect man for the film. He can already see the tagline (well, I can, at least) `And there is only one man who can stop them. Only one man who is an instant moneymaker, audience-attractor and action-hero. Kit Ramsey.'Eddie Murphy plays Kit Ramsey, a successful billion-a-film movie star who has been having some paranoid delusions recently. He goes to a therapist whenever he sees these visions, and the therapist calms him. But he has no idea what he is in store for.After Bowfinger tries to contact Kit in an effort to attract him to the `Chubby Rain' script (to no avail, obviously), Bowfinger hatches a ludicrous plan. A plan that might just work. Who says actors need to know that they are in a movie? What if they were just.filmed, staged? What if you sent an actress up to an actor on the street, told the actress what to say, and filmed it. It could come across that the actor she is talking to is part of the movie. And that is exactly what Bobby Bowfinger does. He films Kit without Kit knowing he is filming him (it all sounds so confusing, but it really isn't).But after Bowfinger's actors go up to Kit and speak to him on the street, Kit thinks that the actors are aliens, and his therapist puts him in a secret mental hospital (rehab?) unit.Bobby Bowfinger is left without an actor.So now, the game is on, as Bobby must find a Kit look-a-like. Fortunately for Bobby, he has just found Kit Ramsey's dorky, nerdy twin Jiff a braces-boasting, gum-chewing, thick-rimmed glasses wearing, loveable freak.But there are more surprises just around the corner for Bobby, as Kit is released from the mental rehab unit and is chased by Bowfinger's actors again, leading to the film's climax. (`Got you, suckas!')Well, now I will evaluate the cast, because the cast of `Bowfinger' is very ensemble.Steve Martin is great in his role as Bowfiner, a hassled director who must resort to an all-time low of filming. But what is great are Martin's dumb-grin expressions throughout the film that make him look like a little child.I have now seen two Eddie Murphy films in two nights `Bowfinger' and `I Spy,' his performance in both surprising me. In `I Spy' he fit Kelly Robinson like a glove, using his loudmouth antics to full advantage, for once. In `Bowfinger,' Murphy uses his talent to his full advantage as well, convincingly pulling off an egotistical actor and nerdy geek.Heather Graham plays an actress wannabe who sleeps with every man on set of the movie to get her way(s).Robert Downey, Jr. has a small role as a film producer; he is in the film in the very beginning, about five seconds in the middle, and at the very end. I'd estimate his screen presence at about four minutes total.Jamie Kennedy plays Bobby Bowfinger's assistant and friend; he works in a back-lot film studio. To help film the `Chubby Rain' movie, Kennedy's character `borrows' film equipment from the film studio and returns it to them before night. Kennedy was very good in this movie, as he is in his television show `JKX' (The Jamie Kennedy Experiment).Now, on to the interesting aspects of the film`Bowfinger' has some very interesting and hilarious sequences, including one segment where Bowfinger is having Kit run across a traffic-packed highway during rush hour for the movie he is filming. Hands down the best scene in the film.The movie also has some interesting `con' ideas, which are very provocative and thought provoking. For instance, Bowfinger sets a camera in a large tree-clipper truck, sets Kennedy up there, drives on a highway and films Kit Ramsey in his car, who is being chased by one of Bowfinger's actors. Who would ever think of that? Only Steve Martin, the writer of this film.The thing that makes this movie so funny is the fact that Kit Ramsey has no clue whatsoever about what is going on. One of Bowfinger's actors (the guy who wrote the `Chubby Rain' script) walks up to Kit and, using a special prank, cuts off his own arm (of course it's a fake arm, but Kit thinks it is real and runs away).Unfortunately, believe it or not, I was overall a bit disappointed in the movie. Yes, it is a clever parody of the film industry, and it was not a bad film at all. It was quite funny. But frankly, I was expecting more laughs after reading so many good reviews and finding out Martin wrote the script.3/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Borefinger","Date":"14 May 2000","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  STAR RATING*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI was attracted to this movie because I have recently become more drawn to family comedy type movies,and because I like Steve Martin.I have always found myself drawn to his opportunistic charm,and comic charisma.But in this movie,his charecter was just horrible.As were most of the others.He plays a self absorbed,thoughtless prick low budget film producer who is prepared to put Eddie Murphy's poor guy action hero charecter through all manner of personal hell just to get him to appear in his dire action movie.Heather Graham ,my surname's sake,plays a filthy whore aspiring actress,who sleeps with most of the film crew ,including Martin,just to boost her fame status.About the only two charecters who I could give half a toss about where Murphy's 2 charecter's,and Terrence Stamp's mental health boss,who finally manages to put his foot down on Martin's selfish little game.Ultimately,Bowfinger emerges as a wasted idea project.It had the potential to work an hilarious,original idea to the ground,but thanks to a crass script and one track performances,comes out as something quite untasty indeed.There are a few funny moments here and there,but,ultimately,I'm suprised this is what the collaboration of two fine hollywood comics boiled down to.** "},{"Title":"The return(?) of Steve Martin","Date":"10 February 2000","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The nineties were not a good time to be a Steve Martin fan; the last movie he did which showed any spark or inventiveness was L.A. Story and that was nearly ten years ago. Not surprisingly, that also happens to be the last time he acted from a script which he himself had written. He was content to spend the rest of the decade embodying flat, middle of the road characters in flat, middle of the road movies (Father of the Bride parts I and II, Housesitter, The Out-of-Towners) while his creative muse sought other outlets in the theater (his play Picasso At the Lapin Agile premiered in 1993) and in the form of  humorous essays (like those collected in his new book, Pure Drivel). These last projects indicate that Martin's surreal and inventive mind has not gone dry, but he seemed to have lost his confidence in film as a forum for communicating his unusual gags and ideas. Would we ever get another original screen comedy from Steve Martin?On that score, Bowfinger is both good and bad news. The good news, of course, is that the script is a Martin original. The bad news is it's clear he has been out of the practice for too long. Or rather, perhaps, he's worked in so many plodding and monotonous comedies now that it's blunted his style. For, the actual idea behind Bowfinger is suitably off the wall (I won't summarize it here, you can read it elsewhere at this site). It's the execution of it that ends up being so uninteresting. The material here needs to be pitched at a heightened, absurdist level if it's going to work - something in the spirit of The Naked Gun or, to reference Martin's own work, The Man With Two Brains. It needs to be clear the filmmakers are aware that the plan here could never really work all kinds of practical problems are involved, from the ability to get good shots of Ramsey without proper camera and lighting setups of him, as well as the need to get him to sign a consent form - not to mention the huge script problem of working his character substantially into the story when the shots they get of him are only few and far between.Now, I can hear some people saying, But it's a comedy!  You're not supposed to think of all those very practical concerns while you're watching it. I agree - so the fact that I DID think of them tells me the film wasn't working, or I wouldn't have gotten so caught up by them. It's because it never really establishes the right *tone*, so we don't know how seriously to take these people, their dreams and desires. On one level Bowfinger is a pure cartoon, just like Martin's Jerk or Sgt. Bilko. Yet, there's just enough pathos and desperation sketched in so that we kind of think of him in more human terms - like Ed Wood, say, or Woody Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. For whatever reason, the combination just doesn't work, and leaves you with the idea that the filmmakers just couldn't decide what kind of film they were making.It doesn't help that Martin is actually pretty lame here as a performer. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen him so tired and apathetic. He valiantly tries to do an impersonation of his normal high-energy character, but it just falls flat. And when you catch performers trying to do themselves, it's a dangerous sign. I can't honestly recall one single thing he personally did or said in this movie which made me laugh. As someone who's worshipped Martin practically from the cradle, it was a pretty dispiriting experience.So should you see this movie? I dunno. It's not a bomb or anything - just kind of average. But considering how lunatic the premise is, average here seems kind of like  failure. One thing's for sure, though it contains one of Eddie Murphy's all-time greatest performances - maybe his best EVER. I'm not talking about his part as Kit Ramsey - that actually draws on the loud-mouthed, overbearing side of Murphy that I think has gotten real old and real annoying. No, it's his part as Jiff, the sweet and slow-witted Ramsey look-alike which Bowfinger uses as a body double. The look and tone he finds to portray this character are just priceless - he draws howls just from his gestures and his reactions. It's your standard geek character, but so wonderfully inhabited and underplayed that it feels totally fresh (and works better than his more hammy and obvious approach in The Nutty Professor). Is it enough to recommend the movie?  Hmmm. . . tough call. It really is a great part, yet the rest of the film does not support it very well. How about wait for a bargain night at your video store - or better yet, just catch on television when it finally airs.

Viewing this was an exercise in watching the clock, and fast-forwarding. I'm very grateful I wasn't stuck watching it in a movie theater. Bowfinger is soooooo bad.The writing is pure limpness. Frank Oz directs a half-interested cast including Martin, who wrote the damned thing. Structurally... also limp. There probably is a funny movie to be made about a vigilante film crew, surreptitiously making a movie without the star knowing he's in it. But it's just not going to be this wholesome and perky. And we're not going to be preoccupied with whether we like the scumbag-producer at the end. John Waters riffed on a similar idea, but made it funnier in Cecil B.

The character and writing are that cutesy & stupid- When Martin says he's going to hire the best crew money can buy, we cut to the desert where he's waving illegal aliens into a van. Firstly, the bump/spike joke format is dead from overuse and lack of imagination, and second, this isn't a joke some establishment guy in his fifties can get away with.Humor in action is a beautiful care-free thing. This ain't humor. How do you have a naturally funny actor like Robert Downey Jr. in your movie and somehow provide him with nothing to do? You'd actually have to work hard to get in the way to make Downey unfunny. Martin was always too concerned with being likable; then he jumped on the Touchstone gravy train, which transformed him into some sort of freakish monster of solicitousness and ingratiation. This is why his stuff will never rise above mediocrity - He's just too boojie in his concern for what people think of him. Everything is played broad so Joe Average will get the joke. Every idea is too mediocre. A viewer couldn't be less involved.Oz and Martin tirelessly flog their toothless, mainstream angles; it shows in every frame of this. Comedy has moved on.

(The script, by the way, sounds awful.) He has no way of getting to Kit, but he tries - and fails. Then he decides to make the film starring Kit anyway, except that Kit won't know it. He has a cast that has been on hold for months, and he rounds it out by holding auditions for $25 each (no checks). Here he finds his leading lady (Graham) and his - and everybody else in the cast and on the crew's - future girlfriend. His parking attendant friend can steal fancy cars for him, and he has another friend who can steal cameras and sound equipment. And he can get a top crew by going out in a van and picking up illegals trying to cross the border. He's set.Bobby tells his cast that Kit won't meet anyone and doesn't want to see the camera, and then stakes out Kit's house, finds out where he's having lunch, etc., and has his actors walking up to Kit and saying lines about aliens, screaming at him or chasing his car. Little do they know, Kit is a little paranoid when it comes to extraterrestrials. He's a member of a mind cult, run by Terrence Stamp, who keeps having him repeat that there are no aliens. As the filming continues and Kit is continually approached by aliens, Stamp sends him on an enforced vacation. That's when Bobby hires a Kit lookalike named Jiff (also Eddie Murphy).This is a preposterous story that's done well enough so that you can believe it could work, and it's a great premise.

There are two possible ways that this can go. Either it doesn't work at all, because the two gigantic ego's can't be combined, either you get an excellent comedy. In this case it has become the second option.Until today, Bobby Bowfinger hasn't had a very successful career as an actor / producer / director in Hollywood. But that will all change. He's reading the script which a friend has written and he is so convinced of its quality, that he decides to take a last shot at fame and fortune. However, there is one small problem no-one wants to buy the script ... except for one famous producer who promises him to do it, when he agrees with one extra line in the contract Kit Ramsey, Hollywood's number one star, has to be in it. Bobby Bowfinger pays a visit to Kit, but the man says no. But no problem! Bowfinger has an 'excellent' solution for that problem. He'll hire the cheapest film crew available and adds an unknown beauty from Ohio, a mentally retarded man, someone who has an unimportant job at a studio... and together they start shooting the SF-film starring Kit Ramsey who doesn't even know he's in it. As they keep following the man through the city, they make him go completely paranoid because of all the strange things that happen around him, but in the end they are able to finish the movie.What probably surprised me the most was how well Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy perform together. I don't think it is very easy for these actors, who are used to be the only ones that offer the comical note in a movie, to share that role. But it works perfectly and together they have made an hilarious movie. Especially Eddie Murphy did an extraordinary job. Not because he was so much funnier than Martin, but because he did not play one, but two roles and still was able to convince me. Of course they have been helped a lot by Frank Oz. This director hasn't got a big career in directing, but what I've seen from him so far certainly wasn't bad (except for the remake of The Stepford Wives which really didn't do it for me).All in all this is a very good comedy about Hollywood and film-making.

Some of these films, such as They Player, focus on the rich and powerful elite in Hollywood.  Others, including Mistress and Ed Wood, are more concerned with the bit players who toil in obscurity, hoping desperately for one shot at greatness.  Steve Martin's Bowfinger falls into the latter category.  It tells the story of nearly bankrupt moviemaker Bobby Bowfinger (Martin.)  Armed with a screenplay entitled Chubby Rain, which he is convinced is the next action masterpiece, Bowfinger attempts to secure megastar Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to play the lead role.  When Kit promptly refuses, Bowfinger finds himself unable to deliver the sad news to his crew, which is composed of country rube Daisy (Heather Graham,) accountant turned screenwriter Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle,) and a hammy prima donna named Carol (played by Christine Baranski.)  Instead, Bowfinger reports that Ramsey accepted the role, but on special terms.  Ramsey, he claims, is a method actor who refuses to interact with any crewmembers while off camera.  Moreover, Ramsey does not even want to see the camera during filming.  Such a thing would distract him and break his concentration.  Bowfinger's plan is an audacious one.  He essentially stalks the megastar, engineering situations in which his cast members can approach Ramsey and deliver their lines while a hidden camera records the scene.  Kit will star in the movie against his will.  This setup is a brilliant basis for a movie, filled with comedic potential.  Unfortunately, Bowfinger fails to deliver on the premise.  The cause of its failure is in its lack of detail.  A brilliant premise is not enough to sustain a film.  A film also needs sharply written details, of which Bowfinger has precious few.Take, for example, the character of Daisy.  She is a wide-eyed country girl, just off the bus from a midwestern state.  But before you can say action she is eagerly hopping into bed with whoever can advance her career that particular day.  We are treated to several scenes of her seducing first Bowfinger, then Afrim, then another actor, then finally the cinematographer. Even the first scene was shaky in its comic potential.  By the fourth, this plot line is merely tedious.  Another weakness can be found in Ramsey's membership in Mind Head, a new-age religious cult apparently modeled after Scientology.  The sets, costumes, and performances in the Mind Head scenes are so outlandish that they stop being funny and merely become silly.  One gets the distinct impression that these scenes were included simply because Martin could not mine enough material from his main plot to fill an entire movie.These shortcomings are a shame, because there are several diamonds in this rough.  While Eddie Murphy turns in a strong performance as the egotistical Kit, he outdoes himself in the dual role of Jiff, a wide-eyed innocent hired as Ramsey's stand-in.  Chubby Rain, the movie within the movie, is a hysterical parody of action film cliches.  Indeed, I would have preferred that Steve Martin completely rework Bowfinger as Chubby Rain, an action film parody from start to finish.  Many critics have praised Bowfinger as a superior comedy.  The only explanation I can find for this is that, at its core, it is a sweet movie populated with fairly likable characters.  This puts it in marked contrast with other big name comedies of the year, including American Pie and Bid Daddy, which use crude vulgarities and shock tactics to entertain.  It is true that Bowfinger is not crude.  But it is also not very funny.

Unfortunately, that decade was the 1980s and this was the late 1990s. Bowfinger disappoints more than it amuses.Martin is Bobby Bowfinger, luckless wannabe movie director who comes up with a desperate scheme to break into the big time Surreptitiously shoot action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy) so Bowfinger can feature him in a film about attacking aliens. Bowfinger thus will have Ramsey's services and marquee name without having to go through the trouble of signing or paying him.I get the feeling the inspiration for writing this movie came to Martin right after he saw Ed Wood. So much of Tim Burton's classic serio-comic celebration of the courage of believing in yourself no matter how bad you are winds up in this film it's almost a remake. Martin has fun satirizing Hollywood culture, not new territory for him or anyone else, but the digs at mindless cults and celebrity lesbians come off labored and thin.The film does start well. We watch Bowfinger carrying on a conversation with a disconnected car phone, trying to impress Robert Downey Jr. playing a slick producer. (Downey is typically brilliant here but badly underused). Meanwhile, Ramsey is counseled on his rampant paranoia by his handlers at Mind Head, the Scientology-like organization Kit belongs to. Even though I feel like I might ignite...I probably won't is his self-help mantra.Murphy is on fire, both as Kit and especially Jiff, a nerd Bowfinger hires as a stand-in when Kit is taken out of circulation for a while. Jiff is one of Murphy's sweetest and funniest characters, a gawky, brace-wearing guy whose idea of complete happiness is running coffee errands and being liked for himself. Asked about his show-business career, Jiff explains he is an active renter of Blockbuster. Will he drop his pants on camera? Jiff breaks into a surprised, embarrassed grin that's one of Murphy's best-ever moments on screen.Jiff is the one plus in the film's second half, which otherwise crumbles into a dopey and contrived farce, pushing Kit really thinking he is under alien attack while Bowfinger gets his footage. As Krumski put it in a 2000 review, it's not the contrivance that's wrong, but that the comedy is so tonally off you can't help but notice it.Maybe if Martin found better actors to beef up his supporting cast. Heather Graham is a bad actress playing a bad actress. I'm not a Christine Baranski fan, either, but she may be the victim of a script that gives her little to do. No one else even registers, not even Bowfinger's dog, and I'm a pretty easy audience for dogs.The worst performer here, it pains me to say, is Martin himself. He waves his hands around antically and plays his part too broadly, straining to sell every one of his lines as comedy gold. They aren't, like when he tells a young actor about the mystical quality called it.It's a special quality. No matter what's going on, you can't take your eye off that person.Do I have it? asks the youth.I'm sorry, I wasn't listening, what?Director Frank Oz teamed with Martin three times before with good results so it's a surprise to see this misfire. Also a shame, given Murphy doesn't collaborate with equal partners often, and brought so much to the table here. Bowfinger entertains in parts, but leaves you wishing and knowing it could have been more.

Mr F.Oz is to be commended for trying to think outside the box to bring new life to a plot that is less well - worn than many,but ultimately,like most movies about movie making,it's all a bit like coming upon an isolated community where intermarriage has weakened the strain and mocking the unfortunates living there.

The idea itself is not all bad, and maybe with a little bit more thought put into it, it might have worked. The biggest downfall of the film though is how unfunny it is.

There is absolutely no need for comedy in this role and I could see Will Smith playing the straight and narrow character with more conviction that Murphy.  As the dim wit however, Murphy is priceless.  So we are one for two here.  Heather Graham is perfect as the seductress who just cares about getting her career started without worrying who she sleeps with or who she hurts in the process.  Martin is good as the producer that will do anything to get his picture made.  And that is what I did enjoy about the film.  I liked how much energy and drive Bowfinger had to getting his film done.  He had a dream and he was going to stop at nothing to complete it.  So you have a message there.  And that I am a sucker for.    But the rest of the film was pretty bad.  And perhaps you are supposed to suspend all disbelief here but there is no way that this film that they are shooting would sell.  First of all they are using one camera, there are all long shots of Ramsey and they have one take to make the shot work.  They also film some of the movie off of a security camera and that just wouldn't work.  I just didn't buy it.  Maybe that is just the stuffy film critic guy coming from me, but hey, I just didn't buy it.Is this film funny?  Yes.  Is it funny more than what you see in the commercial?  Not really.  There are a few humourous moments but nothing to get you excited about.  The inside Hollywood stuff isn't really introspective either.  Producers are sleaze and cut throat and woman sleep their way to the top and stars are spoiled and sex starved.  Yea.. and?  We all know that.  You can get that just by reading an article in Premiere magazine.  So that wasn't earth shattering either.  Really there wasn't that much to like in the film.If you want to laugh this summer, go see South Park or American Pie.  Bowfinger is short on laughs and really doesn't entertain that much either.  It's not really worth the time.  This is a not so great film that had potential to be really great.  Oh well.  Maybe next time.

Martin must work around the fact that the big star he had hoped to cast, play by Eddie Murphy, refuses to have anything to do with the script which is about Aliens invading the Earth in the rain drops. So Martin, bent on making this film, resorts to trickery, having other actors walk up to Murphy and read their lines while Martin films from behind the bushes.It just so happens that Murphy's character is undergoing psychiatric therapy for his extremely paranoid delusions involving Aliens, which makes for very interesting reactions when he is approached by Martin's actors.The acting by Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham was excellent, but overall this movie was so far fetched that it can best be described as stupid. While the movie did get a few chuckles from the audience there was no prolonged roaring laughter that you would expect from the excellent talent in this film, and once again most of the really hilarious scenes were spoiled if you have seen the previews.Three out of ten bullets on the Hit Man Critic scale due mainly to the sheer stupidity of this film.

He would like to cast action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy), but Ramsey is not interested.  He attempts then to film Ramsey anyway, that is, without Ramsey knowing.  Sound dumb?  Yes, it is.  And not that funny either.A fourth of the way into the movie I wished I had wandered into a different auditorium of the multiplex.  By the end, I wanted my money back.  After a funny start (an unseen telephone bill collector tells Bowfinger that it is not necessary to visit a home to cut off phone service), the movie lapses into silliness that I didn't find amusing at all, particularly so after all the media hype.  I should have known that I was in trouble after the opening credits list Steve Martin as writer. A good and talented comedy actor he is, but a writer, he is not.

I mostly found him neutral to slightly annoying to outright bad-slapstick-get-on-my-nerves annoying. For some reason several of his older works and a few more recent ones (Shopgirl) found their way into my rental queue, and I had occasion to revisit his stuff, Bowfinger among them. This is how I discovered that (a) he cannot act, (b) he isn't a very good comic, (c) his writing isn't great, either.It isn't that he hasn't his moments, as an actor, a comic, and a writer. But bad acting, horrible comedic timing, and utterly contrived and unfunny writing are pervasive enough to make it impossible for me to enjoy the better bits properly. Yes, he pokes fun at stuff that deserves to have fun poked at it (Hollywood, in this case, L.A. folks in L.A. Story, etc.), and there are many delightfully accurate observations in his stories---mixed, unfortunately, with saccharine-sweet morality, ham-handedly executed slapstick, and just blatant juvenile stupidity.His absurd is not Monty Python, it's not Charlie Chaplin, it's not even The Simpsons. His absurd is the middle-of-the-road, hit-you-over-the-head-with-the-punchline absurd, no joke unexplained, no movie without message.Of course, it does not help that in this production he is supported by a cast of rather questionable acting talent, such as Murphy, Graham, and Downey Jr., and a puppet master in the director's chair. The combination is about as subtle as the Muppet Show and as funny as Downey Jr. I hope for your sake that you find better things to do with your time.

Basically Robert 'Bobby' K. Bowfinger (Steve Martin, also writing) is the rundown actor/producer/director who hasn't had a hit for some time, and then he finds what he thinks is the perfect script, written by his friend, accountant Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle). Taking a chance on the script, Chubby Rain, which sees aliens falling to earth in raindrops, but of course the script is hard to sell to a famous producer and studio executive Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.). He is insisting that the film can only be made if it stars currently-hot action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), who is brash, pompous, obnoxious, neurotic and very paranoid, he even sees psychiatrist Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp) about his belief in aliens and such things. Bowfinger does manage to get together a team of filmmakers and actors, including determined Carol (Christine Baranski), good looking Slater (Kohl Sudduth), and aspiring young actress who seems naive but has an effect on men, Daisy (Heather Graham), but Ramsey refused. Therefore he comes up with a plan to film Ramsey in secret in order to get all the shots of the movie he is needed, they will film other actors separately. So this includes going up to his house with cameraman Dave (Jamie Kennedy) and the team, having the actors say their lines, not knowing it is secret filming, with Kit reacting in whatever natural way and saying whatever, even if he is terrified. As well as having the cheapest film crew in Southern California, for back shots they have a good lookalike for Kit Ramsey, who they unknowingly didn't know but find out is his brother, nerdy Jefferson 'Jiff' Ramsey (also Murphy). Slowly the people around Kit realise there is something going on causing him to act overly scared and paranoid, and when Bowfinger and the crew want to film their final big scenes that is when they catch them in the act. The film is taken from them because they had no permission, but looking through some footage of Kit just hanging about, they find something that they are able to blackmail Stricter and MindHead with in order to get it back and have Kit himself finish the film. In the end the movie Chubby Rain is an arguable success, and Bowfinger receives a letter he always wanted from FedEx, offering him the chance to direct a new movie with Kit's brother Jiff, this turns out to be martial arts movie Fake Purse Ninjas, where Bowfinger himself also stars. Also starring Barry Newman as Hal - Kit's Agent American Pie's and John Cho as Nightclub Cleaner. Martin is good both acting as the director with the daft ideas for movie-making, and he has written a good satirical script looking at low budget films, and Murphy is good fun as both the loudmouth panicky actor and his overly smiley slow thinking brother, I can sort of agree with the four stars the critics give, a fun comedy.

Heather Graham has one expression, sort of a 'Gee, look at me, I'm in a movie' smirk that's inappropriate half the time. She's also on camera too much. Graham looks exactly like a Hollywood starlet-- surprise!; she should have been a star-struck wannabe from an Iowa farm with bad hair and excess poundage. Janeane Garofalo from 'Mystery Men' would have been right on the money.Steve Martin wrote a great script, but he should have given the lead to someone with a manic sense of action-- Phil Silvers in his prime would have been perfect. Martin's too controlled, too much in charge. Eddie Murphy's two roles, one an action hero type like Will Smith, the other a nerdish double, is uneven. The first one works, the second one enters the movie 'way too late and doesn't have enough time onscreen so we really get to know him.Frank Oz's direction tends to focus too much on the main characters and lets everyone else slide. The illegal Mexican workers that become part of the shooting crew are a golden lost opportunity.There's a sendup of Scientology/New Age Cultism that doesn't go far enough.
