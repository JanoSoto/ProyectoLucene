No, of course not. Is it silly, trashy, but FUN b-grade exploitation SF in the tradition of Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce'? You bet! It isn't quite as entertaining as 'Lifeforce', the original naked space chick movie, but it's a still pretty good way to waste an hour and a half of your life. Why it gets slammed so much is beyond me. Maybe people just don't have a sense of humour. The opening of the movie is terrific. In a lab we see a cold scientist (Ben Kingsley) overseeing the murder of a young girl (Michelle Williams), imprisoned in a glass case. Only she escapes by showing some super human strength. She is immediately pursued by dozens of soldiers, but manages to elude them. We then learn she is in fact a genetic experiment, a mixing of extraterrestrial and human DNA. Kingsley heads up a task force consisting of Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Marg Helgenberger and Forest Whitaker, each a specialist in a different field. Pretty soon our alien fugitive mutates into a gorgeous blonde (Natasha Henstridge), who spends most of her time topless. Kingsley and company face a race against time, they must capture the horny alien girl before she screws guys to death(?) or something... Who knows. Henstridge is great to look at and the above average cast give it their best shot with the lame dialogue and cliched scenes. Whitaker's empath character quickly irritates with his constant stating the bleedin' obvious, but I always get a kick out of watching Madsen, here in stereotypical tough guy mode. 'Species' is big dumb fun.

In 1974, the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) team sends a message to the space with the human DNA, map of our solar system and other information. In return, they receive two messages the first one, with a catalyst for methane; the second, a detailed alien DNA together with instructions to join it with human DNA. The result of the experiment is the deadly creature Sil. When Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley), who is leading the research, decides to terminate the experiment, the girl Sil (Michelle Williams) escapes to Los Angeles. Dr. Fitch joins the mercenary Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen); the anthropologist Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina); the scientist Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger); and the empathic Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker) to chase Sil (Natasha Henstridge). Sooner they discover that the predator Sil has grown-up and became a beautiful woman, trying to copulate to generate an offspring.Species is one of the best sci-fis of the 90's. Full of action, sexy and with a great cast, this film introduces the stunning Natasha Henstridge, one of the most gorgeous and sexy actresses of Hollywood ever. Her debut could not be better, and together with the cult Michael Madsen, they make this pleasant movie work. The story recalls those B-movies from the 50's, but spiced with erotic and very sexy scenes. I have just watched this movie for the fourth time, and I do not get tired to this attractive story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil) A ExperiÃªncia (The Experience) "},{"Title":"Kind of fun","Date":"9 January 2005","Score":"25 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Some scientists working for the government tamper with a DNA sequence they got from a message from outer space.

On the one hand; the film has a great cast and is professionally produced, but on the other - the special effects wouldn't have looked out of place in an eighties film, and the plot concentrates mostly on its sleazy and often silly by-products. That being said, however, the movie is lots of fun; and overall I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the best horror films of the nineties. The film takes obvious influence from a range of similar films, such as Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce and Jack Sholder's 'The Hidden', but it brings all of it's elements together well and somehow manages to feel fresh and inventive. The plot is pure hokum, but it works well; as alien-human crossover 'Sil' escapes from a testing lab with a team of professionals, comprising a psychic, an action hero, a woman etc, on her tail. Sil's ultimate goal is to reproduce, and to complete that aim she must find a man. So basically, what we have here is a sexy, horny, naked chick being chased around before she can have sex with someone. Sounds good to me...I'm not quite sure how director Roger Donaldson managed it, but he's managed to get quite a few names to appear in his film; and most of them do well with their roles. Despite the fact that she probably isn't really, Natasha Henstridge looks clean and pure in the lead role; and this both ensures that she looks the part, and the film is great in that it carries off the juxtaposition of having a sweet-looking virginal woman act like a prostitute. Ben Kingsley is the biggest cast surprise, as the former Ghandi actor looks slightly out of place in a B-movie like this. Michael Madsen is absolutely great in his typecast action hero role and the cast is completed by a memorable performance from Alfred Molina, and a rather annoying one from Forest Whitaker. Marg Helgenberger fails to make much of an impression as Madsen's love interest. The two plots that run concurrently are played out well, and climax nicely. The special effects are key in a film like this, and even though they're cheap throughout - they do look fairly realistic. It's not until we get to the end and the director decides to spoil it with some abysmal CGI that the effects become a problem. But even so, Species takes its plot well and isn't too serious, and I've got to rate this as a really fun flick overall.

Still due to its approach and handling of a really unoriginal concept and story, the movie can be regarded as one of the best science-fiction movies from the '90's.If you need to compare this movie to something, you can easily compare it to any of the Alien-movies. Of course over the years Alien and its sequel Aliens have been ripped-off countless times and film-makers often tried to cash in by making basically Alien and Aliens clones, using the same concept, settings, characters, locations, complete sequences and whatever more that it was that made these two science-fiction movies such an highly acclaimed success. Yes, in my opinion Species can definitely be seen as an Alien clone but out of all the movies that ever tried to rip off the Alien movies in any way possible, this is easily the best movie, that at times even makes you forget how unoriginal it actually truly is.Also no big wonder that the movie should remind you of Alien at times, also since the alien in this movie got designed by the same man who designed the original alien for Alien and all of its sequels. So perhaps this is also part of the reason why you so easily can forgive this movie from ripping off Alien in parts.It's a surprising movie from Roger Donaldson, who had never done any science-fiction or horror before and he also hasn't done any ever since. Donaldson is these days mostly known for directing more serious movies.It's perhaps its horror that also makes this movie work out so well. The movie is not just a science-fiction movie about an alien on the loose but truly knows to create a dark moody atmosphere as well and puts in a couple of true great and effective horror moments, which makes the movie tense and in a way also unpredictable to watch, also since the movie is not too afraid to kill off its main characters.There is also some gore in the movie that is good looking, with its often graphic killings. Also the make-up effects are great and the movie uses some early special effects, that especially for 1995 standards seem like pretty good ones, even though the movie itself somewhat feels and looks like a low budget production.The movie makes a choice not to only follow the team that is called in to hunt down the alien but also shows things from the perspective of the alien herself. She's constantly learning things, which she uses to adapt and blend in and to eventually get what she wants. This approach gives Species a nice extra dimension. It's like The Day the Earth Stood Still, only with a not so friendly alien. The movie also has an amazing cast with actors such as Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Michelle Williams involved. Whenever I hear the name- or a thinking of Ben Kingsley, I'm not thinking about Schindler's List or Ghandi but I'm thinking about Species. I don't now, I just find it to be a very amusing role by him, despite the fact that he plays his character totally death serious.I love this movie!8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Amusing Alien Sleaze","Date":"15 August 2009","Score":"14 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Let's face it, SPECIES is a B movie with an A list cast & production design to match. It's a deceptive entertainment that finally shows it's hand during the boring, silly showdown in the sewer level from Quake II where you have to find the red key & beat the boss monster without the quad damage. I'd always drown before I could find the biosuit. Why this was never made into an adults oriented video game is beyond me, other than the obvious problem with marketing it to teenagers.The whole SPECIES franchise was meant to cash in on the success of the ALIEN films, obviously, and go straight for the amniotic fluid in the reproductive cycle at the expense of logic, probability, and science. It's probably a better movie than it had to be and I'm sure that multiple viewings will bring out more nuances, though that's probably not the idea they had in mind when making it. Once will suffice for most viewers.I enjoyed seeing Natasha Henstridge naked, however, and the H.R. Giger creature designs are fabulous as always. In fact I wondered, is the whole film really a contrivance just to get to see Giger's aliens mating with humans? Why yes, it probably is. And for some people that's enough to warrant watching it regardless of whom the lead body actress is. Giger's designs were sexually suggestive to begin with and with this movie he finally got to see them doing the nasty. I trust he was well paid.In any event it's a wildly popular film for reasons that have nothing to do with the professionalism of the cast & crew. Which by the way someone should have told them before prodding us with their serious, emotive performances that serve as buffer zones between the sex & ooze scenes. Only Michael Madsen seems to be aware that it was essentially an exploitation film and acts accordingly. He's spoken of his pride in the work and it shows, especially when considering that he turned up for SPECIES 2 with it's bonus deathmatch levels and Capture The Flag mod.6/10 "},{"Title":"Worth the watch","Date":"5 February 2006","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Now I'm not a big Sci Fi buff but species wasn't to bad, it mainly focused on the story of how some alien woman was trying to mate on planet earth and of scientists were trying to stop her.

Natasha played the role to a T, with her almost, perfect appearance, and bright, and justly glowing & huge green, also already (alien-ish), eyes. Action scenes, and special effects are top notch, as is standard execution by Steve Johnson, who created costumes, robotic structures, prosthetics and effects for this and a cache of blockbusters like Spider-Man 2 (Easily arguable as the pinnacle of the trio), War of the Worlds, the 1989 classic - The Abyss... and definitely not to be unlisted here, Pet Semetary II, the best one in my opinion, and a personal favorite scary thriller of this reviewer.

Most of the time the alien, called Sil, looks identical to a regular human woman (well, okay, a regular supermodel), making her a difficult target to locate.  The team is concerned that Sil is out to breed, and they're main goal is to stop her before she does.One of the members of the team, Dan (Forest Whitaker), is an empath who feels things deeply.  He provides intuitive commentary on what Sil is up to and why.  His presence creates the impression that there is more to this alien than breeding and destroying humans, and that there is more to this movie than finding the alien and blowing her away.  But, as we find out when the credits start rolling, the alien really has been only interested in breeding and destroying humans, and the movie was really only about finding the alien and blowing her away.  A movie doesn't have to be about more than that, but it shouldn't pretend to be something it's not.I guess the biggest conceit of this movie is that someone who looks like Natasha Henstridge could wander around L.A. for a week without finding someone to have sex with.  She eventually hooks up with one of the team members (Alfred Molina), pushing credulity even further so, the team has been looking for a beautiful woman who supposedly acts like a nymphomaniac because she needs to breed, and some stranger shows up in my hotel room and starts removing her clothing.  Am I the only one who hears alarms going off at this point?Species also contains what must be the grand-daddy of all science fiction cliches the overnight transformation of a child alien into an adult alien.  This trait is so advantageous (especially to the plots of poorly-written science fiction movies), you wonder why humans didn't develop it eons ago.

The  actors are a great line-up and do great work.  The plot is a very interesting  concept and the first time I'd ever seen it. The failure was in taking that concept, one that should have been wonderfully  psychological, and turning it into an action movie that tries to follow up on the  likes of Aliens.**SPOILER ALERT FOR CONTENT BELOW THESE LINES** The back-story, the scientists' experiments and Sil's quick maturity into her  adult form are all interesting and thrilling, though rushed and not given nearly  enough development time.  Sil's dream sequences were one of the places this film  shined.  They were stylish and very revealing into the psychology of this tortured  and instinctively driven main character/antagonist/creature.  It is too bad that  the film's creators chose to pursue their own blind instincts and rush into the  action genre. Instead of resolving character conflicts (Ben Kingsley's character  clearly expresses remorse for his role in abusing Sil, leading to her escape, yet there is zero development of the relationship between them - and it ends rather  abusively to the characters) or even allowing Sil to grow-up psychologically  (despite actually meeting the only nice guy in LA) the film-makers turned to a  cliche of hunt down and kill the monster with a lame it's not dead yet ending  (the rat - how lame). Overall, a massive disappointment to those of us that were looking forward to a  thrilling science fiction movie with intelligent undertones.  Though I hear the  guts and blood action movie lovers were thrilled... Has Species II attempted to take more of a psychological approach?

People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin' woman, she doesn't do anything for me (I prefer shorter, rounder women) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.For one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there's more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA (more on this below). Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as always pointing out the obvious when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.While snobby film critics love to hate Species it's a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like Alien, Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2 and Predator you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as Aliens, Terminator and Terminator 2, but it's on par with Alien (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to Predator. Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned, Species delivers the goods.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.GRADE A- ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie) The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a weed killer from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. It's a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it.

The film touches on many themes, including the meaning of life, human desires, specifically procreation, human interaction, kindness/empathy, selfishness, fear, manipulation, intuition, following orders. It does so in a way that is mostly sublime enough that it comes across as genuine. For example there is a fairly believable romance buried in there underneath layers of alien slime. The dialog is mostly well written and to the point, the actors are great and there's lots of attention to detail. Combine that with some great and grotesque visuals, courtesy of the late Hans Ruedi Giger and some Cronenbergian body horror and you're in for a fascinating ride through Los Angeles.The dialog doesn't always work, like when they're trying to track her down and are quickly jumping to conclusions about things that the audience already knows. Scenes vary in quality, some feel a bit rushed. While the effects are mostly excellent there are some subpar ones, too.Overall I highly recommend it if you can get something out of sci-fi horror.

Sil's growth rate is fantastic, and when the nervous eggheads try to terminate her, she escapes and makes it to Los Angeles. A team comprising the head boffin, an assassin, an empath, a biologist and an anthropologist are scrambled to track her down before she can reproduce &#x85;I really like this movie, but then I'm a sucker for this type of material - it's got mystery, action, clandestine operations, sex, scares, gruesome special effects, intriguing characters and most important of all, a terrific and quite original monster. It may be an Alien knock-off but it has more than enough variety in its premise and depth to the people to justify itself. Sil is a fascinating protagonist as she is forced into a desperate situation, must use all her predatory instincts to survive but also has to confront who she is and the point of her existence. Henstridge is terrific in her debut role, wisely keeping Sil's dialogue pared down but still exploiting the pathos of her monster, not to mention handling the frequent nudity and action scenes with aplomb. The team of experts are a great bunch of character actors, with Madsen the quintessential tough guy, Molina a great comic foil who meets a gleefully sticky end, and best of all Whitaker in another great twitchy oddball part as the guy who can sense people's feelings. I must admit I think this film has a liability though, and it's the third act. For ninety minutes it moves admirably fast, setting up and exploring the story and the character dynamics without any chaff and moving logically on with the chase. The finale though, as our heroes hunt an impregnated Sil through a gloomy sewer system with guns and flamethrowers and all decide to wander off in different directions is much too familiar from every other such picture, starting with Them! forty years earlier. Donaldson's touch slips a little here and this sequence lacks focus and suspense, so for me the movie fizzles out a little. Nevertheless, it's still great science-fiction / action fun, with brilliant special effects by Richard Edlund and Steve Johnson, and horror music fans should savour another fantastic choral string score by Christopher Young. Extremely well scripted by Dennis Feldman, who also wrote The Golden Child and the delightfully crazy Real Men. Whilst not in the top drawer of alien monster movies this is a fun flick, and would make a great double-bill with Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce, which also features a sexy young woman out to destroy the world.

Henstridge plays a comely lab-created alien desperate to procreate before she becomes a victim of accelerated ageing. Having escaped from the clutches of Ben Kingsley's rather ineffectual Dr Fitch, Henstridge roams mid-90s LA looking for suitable mates, only to find herself repeatedly foiled for a variety of unconvincing reasons while Fitch gathers together a motley crew to help him catch his runaway alien. There's Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen), a government hit-man, Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger), some kind of doctor (for whom Lennox unaccountably falls), Arden (a wasted Alfred Molina) another doctor, and, most hilarious of all, Forrest Whittaker as a childlike 'empath.' Having been given their mission, these gallant five set off in their transit van (conjuring memories of Scoobie's gang for some reason) in lukewarm pursuit of Henstridge.If it wasn't for the fact that Henstridge spends a decent amount of screen time without her clothes, I would be tempted to say that Whittaker &#150; or, more accurately, his character - is the best thing about this flick, although probably not in the way that writer Denis Feldman intended. Sitting in the car recently abandoned by Henstridge, Whittaker points in the direction in which the car is facing and, in a dreamy voice, intones, 'she walked&#133; she walked that way.' I mean, come on, what a man! Lesser psychics would have pointed skywards and declared 'she hopped&#133; she hopped that way,' but not our Forest.The film 'borrows' little snippets from a host of other, better, movies, and tries to mesh them together into a coherent whole, but Feldman is not a particularly talented writer and possesses neither the imagination or wit to create anything even remotely interesting.

But even more impressive than Sil (Natasha Henstridge) is the attention given to the supporting players, an unlikely fivesome that develops and interacts realistically and will probably grow on you as the thing moves on.  The supporting lady lead (Marg Helgenberger) probably could have been cast better, but Forest Whitaker's neurotic empath is downright lovable, and Mike Madsen  has the burly Tough Guy nailed and the female viewership well in hand with his usual gravel-voiced, doggy-eyebrowed masculinity.  There are a few gratuitous scenes (Examples include the repetitive nudity, and the happenstance of a pool of oil, while our heroes just happen to be carrying flamethrowers.) but there are just as many instances of real-life nuance that make it believable, such as the awareness of odor (Our heroes actually react to the scent of death... Which never happens in, say, Species II.) and the follow along story method, which has us observing the alien and gradually learning more and more about it and trying to figure out its behavior on our own.  The deceptive sympathy is a nice touch, too, as we often find ourselves thinking of this blonde beauty (Especially when she is a child.) as an innocuous victim of scientific exploitation, rather than the predatory and remorseless antagonist it truly is.  The overall execution of Species is sufficiently intimate due to the easy, build-up pacing, and it looks very polished and professional.  This is not an all out gore party, and not a babbling Sci-Fi picture either; it's a pleasant montage of several different genres, and well worth a Movie Night with the lights off.

An excuse to stare at gorgeous boobs, cleverly disguised as Sci-Fi cinema! Well maybe that's a tad bit exaggerated but, still, the multiple sequences in which Natasha Henstridge walks around topless are unquestionably the most memorable moments of the entire movie. In her debut role, stunning Natasha plays a secret government project, namely the very first scientific hybrid of human and alien DNA. During the opening sequences, she's still a teenage girl but already incredibly strong and too dangerous to keep alive any longer. When project leader Fitch (Ben Kinsley) attempts to destroy her with gas, she escapes on a train and Michelle Williams transforms into Natasha Henstridge. What's the sole thing on a sexy blond alien's mind when she drifts through L.A. all by herself? Procreate, of course, and thus Sil (her codename) hooks up with random men as she's looking for the perfect sperm donor. Meanwhile, Fitch assembles an elite squad that'll be charged with hunting down Sil and annihilate her before she copulates the entire male population to death. Species is a pretty bad movie, yet horror and Sci-Fi fans will definitely find it entertaining due to its large amount of gore and trashy sleaze. The action-sequences are well illustrated and exciting but, as soon the script tries to be intellectual, the whole thing looks stupid and dreary. Especially the characters don't make much sense. Michael Madsen is (again) supposed to be a tough and merciless bounty hunter, but he has a gingerbread heart and falls for a dull female doctor. Kingsley is profiled to be the cold and heartless scientist but he can't even force his authority on a four-headed crew? Oh, and Forest Whitaker is the lousiest spiritual medium ever! Something has happened here, he says whilst staring at the bloody aftermath inside the train carriage. Well duh! You're staring at corpse and the juicy leftovers of an alien cocoon! The special effects are blobby and they regularly brought back memories of cheap B-movies from the 80's, which was nice.

Whitaker is only here so that the alien hunters can glean clues to Sil's movements without hard evidence and stay hot on her hot tail.

It's what Marg Helgenberger aches to do with Michael Madsen all movie.We've grown so inured to that mating message with all our displacement and duplicity and political correctness that when Sil asks a captive woman why she is here on Earth, the woman tearfully laments, I don't know! And people don't! They think they are here to make money, to worship false gods, to get married, work a job, buy a house, blah blah...Writer Dennis Feldman got it right - the purpose of life is to propagate more life. And the organism in this story trying to copulate copiously is designed correctly as well - she is the most alluring thing on two gams. Genetic engineering at its best. Henstridge is so strikingly beautiful, there is nothing else on screen when she glides past. Helgenberger is a tasty specimen herself, but in this movie, Henstridge is in a league of her own.The message gets a little lost when the person on the team who eventually has mind-blowing, unprotected sex with Sil is The Dork. Who promptly explodes with alien bodybursting.There's the other message the more beautiful the chick, the more painful the disease.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

I'm sorry, Ben Kingsley says, a tear flowing from his eye, while men in white suits try to kill a young girl with poisonous gas. Sil is half alien, we are soon told, and the experiments with alien DNA went wrong, but in a way that was probably intended by those who sent it. Marg Helgenberger notices what a perfect biological weapon Sil makes, and Madsen continues She's the cure and we're the disease - from the alien point of view, mankind must be removed from earth. Natasha Henstridge played the innocence of the creature believably, when she goes shopping for the first time, then learns quickly how to survive, but she doesn't get an answer why she's here. In one scenes she asks one of her victims before she kills her if she has nightmares, too. Knowing she's different, she nevertheless feels those beings around her have something in common with her.The idea is by no means new have something dangerous or evil appear in the shape of a beautiful woman - that goes back centuries to witch hunt and vampire myths. However, after the 1980s where aliens were either sweet and nice (E.T., Close Encounters) or ugly and aggressive (Aliens, Predator), so that the outer appearance was telling everything, it was good timing by the producers of Species to create an alien in perfect disguise. The design by Giger for its biological phases is amazing. But Species isn't perfect. It tries on one hand to be scientific and on the other hand introduces a guy with supernatural psychic gifts. And then, fast biological growth and learning a language in two days are two different things - the audience will hardly be convinced that could actually happen. Nonetheless, Species is a memorable, important film for the genre in the 1990s. I voted 8/5/6/7 for the 4 parts of the series.

'Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill' meets 'Alien'. The director is a good, competent VERY COMMERCIAL director but Meyer had the fire in the belly. Also his specialty was this sort of sexy death stuff. Could have been truly memorable instead of merely solidly watchable. The movie should have had emphasis squished around here & there; First, we see way too little of young Sil. Her character development needed to be extended by at least a sequence or two. All the neat nuances of daddy (Kingsley) vs daughter conflicts could have been brilliantly riffed on. The young actress (Michelle Williams)was way capable of doing this. All sorts of other delicious bits about the pre-pubescent American girl pop into mind almost unbidden. But no all we get is a little train ride & then the metamorphosis. I shudder to think what old Russ could have made happen here. Second, Grown up Sil's romp thru the LA club scene should have been the whole rest of the movie; death sequence & all. I mean what's up with this cave thing? Caves are such CHEAP sets. When I was dragging scenery around on the old 'Santa Barbara' series they got into a stupid cave thing about the time they canceled it. Half the stuff in the old 'Flash Gordon' movie series was done in cave sets because they're so CHEAP. The final hunt & alien pregnancy thing would have been so wonderfully gory (& incidentally so much better for some great comments on the people mating scene) if staged in disco sets. The alien birth on a bottom lighted & strobed dance floor; WHOA what a cinematic moment. The tyke scuttles off into the shadows. In short the movie had way too modest of a scope. Don't be no ant man, an ant man has low horizons. My personal favorite Gumpism.

I decided to go see the full movie of Species to see if it would be a good 90's science fiction flick.It started out with a beginning where it has been done quite a bit of times. Some scientists decide to experiment with alien DNA and Human DNA without thinking that there could be some serious effects after wards. They decided to keep her locked up for study and then decide to kill her until she breaks out of the cell with abnormal strength and somehow escapes a military research facility with a lot of security judging by the soldiers as security. I have seen this technique before in other movies that I have watched when I was younger. The premise was simple stop the alien/human hybrid before she mates with a normal human or she'll have a baby that will destroy the human race. This of course means that there is tons of nudity and sexual content. As for destroying the human race, I must admit that this is a weird way of death by alien situation considering that all she needs is a baby so the human race will be destroyed by a hybrid having sex. This then turns into a cat-and-mouse theme for a team of people have to search and destroy her and thus ending up to be a film full of car chases, walking around in Los Angeles and some sets of female nudity along with short-lived sexual relationships with men who want to get jiggy. It also uses some repetitiveness such as that the team nearly tracking her down but ends up a few minute late so she gets away until the next time they meet. She also seems to go after the rich men. The story could definitely be better.Long story short, it's a cat-and-mouse scenario with a team of people who are always one step behind of an alien/human hybrid who wants to mate with a human so she can have off-springs that can harm the human race with recycled elements from previous movies with the same scenario.Some of the special effects were quite nice and pretty gross for those who are easily grossed out, especially at the chrysalis parts and such. Some of the times Sil in her alien form seemed a little bit computer generated without the finishing touches to it so it turns out to look fake.Now for the good parts. The acting was good (though the actress for Sil could of done a better job) the action was good and had some scary moments that surprised. These made the film more watchable for me.My overall opinion on this is that this is an alright movie even though it has quite a bit of flaws and has not a lot of logic and has a story and elements that have been used before. It is watchable for men who really like watching flicks with sexual themes. It was an alright movie but it isn't something I would want to watch again.

And, for an out and out B-movie, Species has to be up there with the best of them.There is nothing particularly 'stand-out' about anything in it. An alien &#x96; or rather the most ATTRACTIVE alien you've ever seen &#x96; is unleashed on an unwitting L.A. population and we follow the rag-tag bunch charged with the task of tracking her down before she reproduces (and, if you're interested, the 'reproducing scenes' are worth watching this film from most red-blooded males' points of view!).Absolutely nothing new to see, just a hell of a load of cheesy fun that, albeit quite serious, never gets heavy enough to drag the film down into a melodrama. It just manages to stay slightly above 'tongue-in-cheek' to allow everyone (and when I say 'everyone' I probably just mean men) to enjoy the crazy, corpse-strewn ride.There are plenty of memorable moments, but most of those involve a nude woman.

Nothing lasts foreverAt a top-secret Utah facility headed up by Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley), scientists have created Sil (Natasha Henstridge), a half-human, half-alien product of experiments with DNA codes obtained from beyond the stars. Unfortunately, Sil has escaped. Her primary objective is to mate, and, with the ability to transform herself into an incredibly powerful alien creature, puny humans can't stop her. So Dr. Fitch calls in a quartet of specialists (Forest Whitaker, Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger, and Alfred Molina), to attempt Sil's capture. At the same time, Sil is leaving a trail of mostly male corpses in her hormonal wake. The organic-flavored alien designs for Species were provided by H.R. Giger, the artist responsible for the memorable creatures and spaceships of Alien (1979). When MGM decided to cut the spectacular train birth sequence in the interest of budget-trimming, Giger personally financed this $100,000 showcase of his work.This campy, cheesy, B-grade movie starts off strong. The major players are introduced, the comedy was well-timed and the thrill was executed with precision. The first half was impressive if I put it so bluntly but its sad to say, the second half drags the whole movie down. The ending scene inside the sewer was shoddy and ridiculous. The acting was okay. Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), Gandhi (Ben Kingley) , CSI lady (Marg Helgenberger) and blonde bombshell Natasha Henstridge who made her debut in this movie was okay in a cheesy, sci-fi/horror kind of way.

From there she jumps onto another train where she hides out & forms into a cocoon, only to re-emerge as a full grown adult (Played by NATASHA HENSTRIDGE) mere hours later! Arriving in L.A. she immediately tries to fit in with the outside world, learning how to dress & survive in our world, but more importantly, she must find a suitable male to mate with & heaven help those who do not meet her criteria, since the wrong mate will find himself suffering a bloody death! In his attempt to catch Sil before she mates & creates offspring, which could lead to the destruction of mankind, within a matter of a few months, Fitch employs a team which includes Molecular biologist Dr. Laura Baker (MARG HELGENBERGER) government assassin Dan Smithson (MICHAEL MADSEN) anthropologist Steven Arden (ALFRED MOLINA) & empath (another word for Psychic) Dan Smithson (FOREST WHITAKER). He reveals to the group that S.E.T.I. (Search For Exterterrestrial Intellegance) had received messages from space, containing a DNA code which was then implanted into an female human embryo, which in turn aged the creature at an incredible rate a creature he named SIL. On the hunt, the group discovers a trail of mangled bodies & discovers that Sil is onto them & will do whatever it takes not to be found & captured, even if it means hunting them down in return & the group discovers that while planning to catch Sil is a relatively easy plan, executing it will be anything but.Make no mistake about it, SPECIES is really nothing more than a direct to video B movie, more similarly akin in both plot & execution to a low budget ALIEN rip-off, that someone like B movie king ROGER CORMAN would have come up with, for one of his low budget quickie knock-offs. The difference here is, is that SPECIES was given a huge theatrical release & boasts a strong A list cast! It's plot varies very little from a typical B movie monster plot, a few gory kills, naked females, a couple of raunchy sex scenes & a monster predator from another world is all here. The creature (miraculously done) is a creation of ALIEN creature designer the late H.R. GIGER, it really is a nice piece of work. The gore effects here can get a little nasty, as we get a chopped off finger, a torn out spine, an alien tongue is fired into a guys mouth & thrusts itself out the back of his head, plus many other fun gory moments. Best of all, SPECIES includes two elements left out of practically all the B movies that usually deal with this type of plot - Suspense & tension!The plot itself (which rips off the plot of A FOR ANDROMEDIA (1961)) is a lot of fun, as we watch Henstridge trying to adjust to life, trying to figure out what people wear, learning about money & credit cards, how to drive & more importantly how to pick up guys, even if she has to do it the way a hooker does! all the while constantly alluding the authorities & getting naked a few times & then violently killing those who don't meet her requirement as a perfect mate. There's some very impressive stunt work on hand here & the gory kills are fun & very well done. The direction by ROGER DONALDSON is very good & the acting is perfect all around, with fun characters & enough plot twists & turns to keep the viewer hooked. Plus there's a decent enough amount of suspense & tension on hand here & Henstridge is gorgeous as SIL & plays the part well. CHRISTOPHER YOUNG'S score is really good, while RICHARD EDLUNDS visual effects are a knock out at times. All in all, while it is by no means a masterpiece (at least in terms of it's plot execution) SPECIES is just plain B movie fun all around.

Aliens send a code for DNA splicing which results in a quick-growing species which is bound to reproduce. After lots of chases and near-misses, she/it is apparently cornered in a cave and burned to oblivion. However, since there were sequels, we know the species's DNA must have survived. As the film ends, we see a messy-looking young boy with a glint in it's eye, then a long tongue reaches out to zap a rat. We know the species survives.The main attraction in this film is the beautiful Canadian Natasha Henstridge, who at 20 was in her first film. Her character's (Sil) mission is to be impregnated, and she quickly learns that taking off her top is a good way to start. Henstridge is a true trophy girl, looks great with her top off, and looks far more mature than her age. I noticed the same thing with her in The Whole Nine Yards. She was a perfect choice for the role, however I could never quite get used to this beautiful woman turning into an ugly, evil monster that could devour a man.

The Sil alien is probably one of the worst special effects I've ever seen in a film.  It looks so fake.  Director Roger Donaldson thought that the more they showed the alien, and the more it hissed and screeched like an animal, that it would be much scarier.  Quite the opposite of what I think is scary.  The official Alien films were great, because it was rare that you even got a glimpse of the creature.

And it was the success of Species that led to a whole new batch of revivals (ripoffs!) on that same theme. Alien predator on a killing spree. The novelty of Species is this is an alien/human hybrid. Its a woman. And there's even a hint of Basic Instinct thrown in for good measure.Although Species has been trashed in quite a few corners, its not an altogether bad film. In fact, its a guilty pleasure of mine. Its got a little bit more going for it than your standard, run of the mill B-Grade creature feature. Its got good direction. Some stunning conceptual designs from Alien man H.R Giger himself. The haunting musical score from Christopher Young is effective. And there's a surprisingly good cast.We've got Ben Kingsley as Dr Xavier Fitch, the sinister scientist who's let this monster loose on the public. He's the last person you'd expect to find in a film like this.Michael Madsen is good as always as Preston Lennox, a freelance troubleshooter. With all the best lines.Alfred Molina puts in a humorous turn as anthropologist Dr Stephen Arden.Marg Helgenberger is OK as biologist Laura Baker.And Forest Whitaker, in a role 100 light-years away from his Oscar winning Idi Amin, puts in a rather irritating performance as empath Dan Smithson. A psychic who seems to be one step behind everybody else.Species brought to light the previously unknown Natasha Henstridge as Sil, the shape-shifting sex-bomb desperate to mate with a compatible male and start a whole new species. She's certainly physically matched to the role. She spends half the time topless, peeling off her clothes at every opportunity. When it comes to actual acting ability, Henstridge expectedly comes up a bit short. She never really generates much of a threatening presence. Famke Janssen would have been more ideal to the part. With her exotic good looks, she can tantalise and communicate sinister intent all at the same time.Also Sil picks up driving and accessorising in a surprisingly short amount of time. She's designed to be threatening or fragile depending on the needs of the moment. Which is pretty poor writing if you ask me.But despite the utter predictability of it all, I for one rather liked Species. Its quite easy to get into, and there are moments that hold an intensifying charge. The scenes of a teenage Sil about to be killed through Cyanide by Fitch is a real corker of an opener. As is her escape, and her eventual metamorphosis into the beautiful, adult Sil.Its nice to see H.R Giger back in SF again. And with Species, he does manage to craft more of his customary striking imagery. Sil's nightmares are interesting but much too brief to leave any real lasting impact. Except for the image of a train that almost looks like carriages engaged in a sexual act. When it comes to creating the alien half of Sil, he's less successful. She looks like a poor imitation of Giger's own designs for Alien. And the special effects are so variable they never instill an inhuman, unearthly horror in you like they're supposed to.Species is at its most effective when the plot is moving along. And for the most part, it moves at a brisk pace. Like the team's investigations and Sil's discovery of her alien half. Some scenes don't work. The scene where Preston and Laura are trapped in a lab with a growing alien DNA sample begins on a suspenseful note, but it goes on for far too long. And Ben Kingsley's annoyingly bureaucratic performance saps the scene of all its shock value. Compare it to Ripley and Newt's similar situation with two face-huggers in Aliens. That's the way to do it!Also, what exactly are Sil's nightmares supposed to represent? The film never bothers to explain. I get the impression at perhaps some early stage, they would have played a more important part than they do. Even Sil questions what they mean at one point. But obviously any further development on that subject has been left on the cutting room floor. So Sil's motivations are maddeningly incomplete. We're never even sure why she wants a baby so badly. She just suddenly decides she does. (An excuse to include some sex scenes probably!).Species does make up for some shortcomings in other areas. The byplay between the team feels natural and easygoing. And Michael Madsen saves a lot of scenes with his droll delivery. When Fitch tells them they made Sil female because she would be more docile and controllable, Preston replies You guys don't get out much!They are really just a bunch of stereotypes, but because they're such a good bunch of actors, they help to make Species more enjoyable than it has a right to be. Shame that at the end the film heads straight for B-Movie territory. Beforehand, there are some genuine jolts. Like the horrible scene when Sil cuts off a woman's thumb just to see what will happen.But at the end, it goes for the mundane. Starting with a faked death. Stolen from Alien. And then a final shootout. In some caves. In LA! Anyway, because of the poor optical effects, it robs the climax of any tension, and by that time you're half wishing the film were over.When it finally is, does Species leave a lasting impression? Natasha Henstridge's perfectly shaped arse certainly does. I suppose the film doesn't completely fade from memory. But its not something you'll be revisiting all that often.

Ben Kingsley won the Oscar for his role as Ghandi in the 1985 film. Here, Kingsley portrays the British Doctor Xavier Fitch, who together with Doctors Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) and Stephen Arden, decide to play God and create a hybrid- a perfect specimen of a woman (Natasha Henstridge) who has one human parent and one space alien parent. The alien side of her, of course, takes over completely. Before long, Dr. Fitch and his crew realize what a monster and global threat they have unleashed. The creature assumes the body of the seemingly innocent, blonde beauty Sil who immediately sets out to mate and populate the earth to a degree they will destroy all the humans, whom she believes are inferior. She seeks out nightclubs in LA to find the right mate. Dr. Fitch, Dr. Baker and Dr. Arden have a strong hero on their side- Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen) who wishes to put an end to the alien's predatory game. The film did not do well at the box office because the script by Dennis Feldman is nothing noteworthy and borders on camp. It's likely he was influenced by episodes of the popular series The X Files but he is clearly trying too hard and produced nothing good. The photography and cinematography is by foreign, no-name Andrzej Bartkowiak, who is clearly attempting to make this film look like a thriller modeled after Basic Instinct and Alien. Natasha Henstridge behaves like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct when she is after what she wants- which is a sexual partner. Nevertheless, she is wooden and robotic in her performance, even when she attempts to behave like a normal human female. The music by Chris Young is rather dramatic but not memorable. This movie is now mostly enjoyed by young sci-fi fanatics who don't mind the cheesiness and appears on TV and cable in the late night hours. It is nothing worth raving about but it has a certain badness that also makes it good. I give it at least a 7.

"},{"Title":"Wow, Natasha Henstridge was literally born naked into the movies.","Date":"7 December 2004","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Species starts out with a great premise. Scientists receive radio signals from outer space that, when decoded, include an alien form of DNA and instructions for combining it with human DNA, resulting in attractive human creatures that have attributes of the alien species. In the opening scene of the movie, scientists are trying to gas a cute little blonde girl to death, having learned that this particular alien species is far more than we can handle and, my god, making it female didn't make it more docile and controllable after all. I find the beginning premise fascinating to no end, but probably because I always forget that such story lines are dreamed up by people who have no more clue about what's out there than I do, so I'm probably not going to learn anything. That's why movies like this tend to go downhill in the second half.One of the most startling characteristics of this new species is its rapid growth rate. The subject has grown to the size and appearance of a 10-year-old girl after only a few days, and then before long into the statuesque form of Natasha Henstridge not long after. At this point, still well within the confines of the first act, it may become apparent that, if she has grown to maturity almost immediately, you might think she would grow into an old woman and die of old age before the week is out. Later in the movie you may also wonder how a few cells can grow into a bubbling mass of organic matter before the very eyes of shocked and frightened scientists with no nourishment whatsoever. What is being metabolized to allow it to grow like that?No matter. It's strange that the movie started off with such an interesting premise, a radio signal from a clearly intelligent alien species, and then all of a sudden we realize that that intelligent species is nothing but another slimy Hollywood alien. Try to imagine this alien, in its own form, sitting down to compose a radio signal including instructions for how to combine two types of DNA, and you have the chink in this movie's already thin armor. Forest Whitaker is great as the movie's resident psychic, I don't know why, he just fits roles like that really well. He's got one of those faces that always seems to be deep in thought, and is clearly not someone who easily fits in with the mainstream. He's very good at conveying emotion, from extreme sadness to gleeful happiness, and interestingly one of his best scenes is one in which he's drunk. Alfred Molina is also very good as the anthropologist, a very different role from the one he may now be better known for in Spiderman 2. There is a young actor named Michelle Williams who gives a wonderful performance as Sil, the human form of the alien, as a young girl, effectively portraying her fear of her sterile surroundings. Once she turns into the blonde bombshell that is Natasha Henstridge, the majority of the rest of the film is concerned with her burning desire to mate and create babies and with everyone else's growing desire to stop her before they lose containment even more completely. One thing that I found interesting about the movie was the locations. It was filmed mostly on location in Hollywood and the Santa Monica area, which is where I live, so it was interesting to see all of these street locations that I know so well. I found it a bit odd, though, that in one scene Michael Madsen's character reads Dr. Baker's (his romantic interest in the film) home address, which is a real address in Simi Valley. My grandparents live in Simi Valley, and over the Thanksgiving holiday this year I decided to ride my bike by the house that was mentioned in the movie. It's just some house, in case you were wondering, but the address is real.There are some strange scenes in the movie, such as the one where they find the crashed car that Sil was in, find the tip of one of her thumbs in the car, and assume that she's dead. What do they figure happened to the rest of her body? Vaporized? There is some great poetic justice, you might say, in her choice of a mate, but my favorite part of the movie was the part at the end when the woman wonders which half of Sil, the human or the alien, was the predatory half. Pretty interesting question about humanity, although a bit jarring to have come from what is at best a second rate science fiction film.

They could have shown Gandhi or Sexy Beast but instead, we get Species - a modern version of those monster movies from the Fifties when it was a guy in a rubber suit. Here, the suit in question is the frequently nude Natasha Henstridge who is a human-alien hybrid, running rampant in downtown LA looking for a mate. And that, I'm afraid, is as deep as this film goes.The biggest let-down for this picture was the central premise, an idea almost as bad as that naked Keith Chegwin show on Channel Five a few years back. While the assorted cast (including Kingsley, Forest Whitaker as an apparently Muslim empath and Michael Stern Chops and Deep Voice Madsen) sleepwalk their way through the material, the audience stare slack-jawed at the screen for the next scene involving Henstridge's bare breasts. Well, the male audience. It almost suffered the Backgammon effect - the signs of a really boring movie when I reach for my mobile and boot up a game. I got to the menu but remembered my reviewing duties and so re-locked the keypad.Considering how flimsy the script is, it would almost be forgiven if it wasn't trying to be exactly like another, more successful monster movie. In its attempt to emulate Ridley Scott's superb Alien, they even bring in H.R. Giger (who designed the original Alien beastie) to design the alien creature here. Sadly, it looks rubbish. This new alien, called Sil, closely resembles the Alien queen - it gives birth through its chest and has a protruding set of teeth within its jaws. Giger's earlier monster looks like a creature from another world. Here, the alien has highlighted nipples mounted on a pair of perfectly formed milk-mounds (of course) and spikes protruding from its spine - about as scary as a six-week old baby that's fast asleep. The needless nudity is the only thing left to grab the attention as the good guys appear more and more incompetent and you end up rooting for the alien to eat them all up. To cap it all off, the ending was sign-posted from the beginning and left wide open for a sequel, which duly arrived. I'm not a big fan of this type of movie making. Make a film as though it were a one-off, unless you intend on making one story last over more than one film like Lord Of The Rings, for example. It's cheap and gives the impression that the film you're watching is nothing more than an exploitative money-making scheme. That feeling stank like high Hell come the end of Species.As you may have gathered, I did not like this film. It's dull, predictable and insulting to your intelligence. It isn't the worst film ever made, not by a long stretch - McCinsey's Island still holds that dubious honour by my reckoning. It's just not a very good one. Throw in some clunky special effects, the return of rubber suits (or what looks very similar) and possibly the worst bunch of heroes assembled for an action movie and Species will slip your mind faster than a new PIN code.

I'm surprised they weren't sued (though I did hear there was legal action about something). The movie is quite terrible after a promising first half and Forest Whitaker gives one of the worst performances of all time. The logic of the film is suspect, how does a thousand soldiers from the base manage to be in the all the places, the escaping Sil is not at the start and why do you need to get the bunch of no hopers in this film who had nothing to do with the project to find her. Why not just use the army who are trained to do it - or even the Federal Marshals. This lot would be the last on any list?

This is downright creepy and scary, with tension, several nice jumps and some truly grotesque sights and sounds.

The CGI is dated, and perhaps it wasn't impressive to begin with. This is genuinely funny. The concept isn't bad. And this was the first role for the incredibly stunning Natasha Henstridge.

You have an alien who is a girl child. She explodes through the time line growing up really fast. Soon, she is old enough to copulate and reproduce. And there is a bunch of guys who want to make sure she does not reproduce for the simple reason that you do not want the earth to be full of alien kids. Now, in all her desperation to copulate you get to see Natasha's character with bare minimum clothing. And just you are getting in the mood she turns into her alien form and then does something that leaves a bloody mess. It takes away the whole mood. So, in the end neither do you have the scope to appreciate the depth of a character and neither do you have the will to dream about spending a good time with her! The movie could have gone in a different direction. Instead of a mindless struggle of the character to have sex and a mindless chase of the agents to catch her and prevent her from doing so, the movie could have shown some kind of a struggle between the human side and the alien side. After all, the girl was shown to be an end product of some kind of a symbiotic combination of the human and the alien DNA.

Experiments conducted by a group of scientists (led by po-faced Ben Kingsley) on a little alien girl called 'Sil' go disastrously wrong when she escapes from their lab, develops and has only one thing on her mind mating. A group is assembled to hunt her down before she manages to have a baby with some unfortunate human male. What follows is simply a bit of sci-fi fun. The film is full of action and the action scenes and special effects are well done. The cast is surprising, simply because it is so good! Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forrest Whittaker, Marg Helgenberger and Sir Ben Kingsley. Yet with this ensemble cast, not one of them turns in a particularly good performance. Blame for this should in part be attributed to the awful script. Nevertheless, Helgenberger is bland, Whittaker is irritating and Ben Kingsley (of Gandhi, House of Sand and Fog, Sexy Beast and Schindler's List fame) is absolutely terrible. The characters fail to be fleshed out and fail to be likable. Alfred Molina's character is somewhat endearing though. Making this film popular with the male population is perhaps Natasha Henstridge as the alien Sil. She spends a large portion of the film without any clothes on trying to seduce various men she picks up. Her acting ability is questionable but that's probably not why she was chosen for the part!

The decision has been made to terminate the experiment, that means Sil has to be killed which is an idea she isn't keen on so breaks out of the lab & disappear into the darkness of the night.

Together they trace Sil to Los Angeles where they must find & stop Sil before she mates & infects the human race with the strain of deadly alien DNA...Directed by Roger Donaldson I thought Species was a good solid horror Sci-Fi film. Why does the IMDb list Species main genre as drama? Horror is the last one it lists when it should be the first. The script by Dennis Feldman moves along at a fair pace although I must admit my interest started to wain towards the end & there are some gaping plot holes that annoyed me. For instance why is it so hard for Sil to have sex? I'd have thought having the looks of Natasha Henstridge would mean she could have sex morning, noon & night if she wanted! I don't know about Los Angeles but where I live we'd be queueing up round the block! Also when she knows that Fitch & his team are after her why does she deliberately seek them out, even after she has faked her own death? Why attract the attention of the only people on Earth who know who she is & want to kill her? On a positive note Species provides good entertainment & Natasha Henstridge naked, what more do you want? With an estimated budget of $35,000,000 director Donaldson does an OK job but fails to create much tension or atmosphere, Species looks & feels rather bland & forgettable throughout. A sequence when Lennox & Baker are trapped in a isolation chamber with some mutant alien DNA falls particularly flat & is distinctly ineffective. The special effects are a mixed bag, some of the CGI Sil alien effects at the end are poor by todays high standards although the special make-up & creature effects look better. The alien Sil was designed by H.R. Giger complete with exaggerated red nipples one of which shoots out & acts like a tentacle isn't exactly a million miles away from the look of the alien from Alien (1979) which Giger also designed. There is some violence & gore here as Sil leaves behind a steady supply of bodies, a ripped out spine, tentacles bursting through the back of peoples heads & a chopped off thumb. The acting is OK by all involved although Kingsley isn't given that much to do, Madsen makes for a likable hero. The sequel Species II (1998) came three years after this & in my humble opinion is better. Species is definitely worth watching although I think it plays a little longish at times & I doubt I'll be sitting through it again anytime soon.

An interesting science fiction premise; aliens send radio message in response to our radio signals being sent out into space. This alien message details how to combine human DNA with Alien DNA. A Top Secret government project ensues and follows the direction to create Sil (half human/ half something else). Orders come from above to terminate the creature, but Sil escapes as her abilities were drastically underestimated. The rest of the movie follows a special unit as they attempt to track the rogue creature, and it attempts to situate itself in modern Los Angeles. Natasha Henstridge is excellent as the awkward but vicious creature Sil. It was interesting to watch her character learn by observation the habits and practices of humans. Generally competent performances all around. Michael Madsen plays the badass character quite well again. Forest Whittaker is also good as the psychic.Good directing, interesting art direction, and decent characterization provide an intriguing story line. The action sequences are pretty solid and engaging. Kind of violent and gory, but I happen to enjoy these elements in a horror flick. Several scenes of Natasha's beautiful nude body, but it fits into the story (Sil wants to complete her life cycle by having a baby, so sex scenes are inevitable). The creature design itself is excellent. A CGI creature designed by the immortal H.R. Giger, I greatly approve of the monster. My only complaint is it looks a little too fake at the end of the movie (not the most realistic CGI effects). My main complaint is the story completely falls apart at the end. I suggest turning the movie off once they enter the sewer for the final showdown. The ending is rather dull and sadly predictable (not to mention a complete rip-off straight from Alien with the metal grate walkways and the creature lurking above). We see the creature more clearly, but less would be better considering the unrealistic CGI effects. FINAL RATING 7/10 - This movie could have been great if only it had a better ending. As it stands, it still remains a intriguing and action-packed Sci-Fi adventure up until the last twenty minutes when it all falls apart. Fans of the Sci-Fi/Horror genre (as I am) will probably like this film very much despite its flaws.

Species is a terrific example of a trailer flick.  Lots of action, lots of science fiction technobabble, alien monster designs by H.R. Giger (of Alien), good actors, a drop-dead gorgeous, sexy babe to play a sex-crazed alien . . . what more could a filmgoer (or, at least a sci-fi filmgeek) want?  As it turns out, quite a lot, actually. Like a plot.  Or a sense of direction.  Or an ounce of common sense.  Or a clue.   Species features none of these commodities, which makes it unappealing for the vast majority of filmgoers; it also features precious few moments of excitement, gratuitous violence, and gratuitous nudity, which makes it unappealing for the teenaged male filmgeek audience.  Either way, the movie is pure garbage, little more than a Friday the 13th, Part 5 film with a sci-fi label slapped on its side.The convoluted mess that passes itself off as a story in Species actually starts off with a slightly interesting premise Radio telescopes pick up signals from deep space that, when translated properly, reveal a formula for an alien DNA string that can be combined with human DNA. This DNA combination, in theory, should produce a hybrid creature that has both human and alien characteristics, allowing humans to learn about this alien species in a manner that is at least slightly familiar ground.  The premise, though, quickly devolves into schlock as the alien hybrid -- named Sil (Natasha Henstridge) -- quickly develops and matures into a blonde bombshell capable of posing as a Penthouse centerfold.  She also develops a need to breed with human males -- turns out that her progeny, of course, will turn into vicious alien killers that want to destroy humankind.  Scientists figure out a little too late that Sil is basically bad news for mankind, so she is able to escape from them without much difficulty, and it is left up to Professor Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) and his motley crew of scientists and soldier to either capture or destroy Sil before she can mutate into her true, disgusting, alien form &#150; and is able to set in motion the destruction of the Earth . . .Species is predictable to a fault, and offers no insight into any of the potential (and few) interesting ideas it offers.  Who are the alien beings? Where do they come from?  Why do they care about humanity at all, and why do they want the human race wiped out of existence?  Because alien beings are bad -- at least that's the only explanation offered.  Sil, the alien hybrid, also offers some true glimmers of interest.  At one point in the film, when confronted with her destructive nature, she asks her creators What am I? in a somewhat pitiful manner -- her need to mate and destroy is driven by instinct, not by conscious thought, and even she recognizes the horror lurking inside her.  A savvier film would've explored this idea further; Species instead chooses to focus on deep, insightful things like Sil removing her bra in slow motion, blood, and big explosions.  By the time our supposedly smart heroes are chasing Sil through a dark labyrinth of sewers, it's obvious that Species has nothing to offer apart from the message offered in the first ten minutes -- alien beings are bad.The direction of Species is obscenely lazy -- most of the supposed thrills generated by the film involve Sil jumping out of the darkness and attacking things.   This works maybe once or twice, but after the first dozen or so times, it stops being even remotely scary.  Director Roger Donaldson's solution to this problem is so simply start adding blood and gore to these scenes, which again works once or twice . . . and then gets boring fast. Unfortunately, everything gets permanently boring somewhere around the halfway mark of the film.  Species is a film that thinks it's enough to just show up with cool-looking monsters and special effects . . . wrong. It's called suspense, and it's sorely missing from this film.  You'd think that a film borrowing from the look and designs of Alien would at least have the decency to check out how Ridley Scott made Alien a masterpiece of suspense.The acting?  Not much can be said about it, apart from it's mediocre at best, awful at worst.   It's hard to knock Natasha Henstridge for a role that merely asks that she become eye candy for the first half of the film -- she does exactly that, and nothing more.  I hope she was paid well. As for Ben Kingsley . . . I'm a big fan of his in other films, but he simply mails in a performance here.  He actually looks bored in his scenes.  I can't say I blame him, given how bad this flick is, but still, c'mon, a little effort, please?  The rest of the cast is completely forgettable, which is probably a good thing.  I wouldn't want to be remembered as a featured actor in Species, either.Species is a film that aspires for big-budget greatness.  Unfortunately, it's crap that even Roger Corman wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. There's worse sci-fi films than Species -- namely, Species 2 -- but not many.

One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work.Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin.The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to.It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies.Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

( the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life ), a team of scientists, headed by Fitch ( Ben Kingsley ) have picked up strange signals from outer space that appear to be a genetic code. The code is then used to create a human being - a young girl whom they christen 'Sil' ( Michelle Williams ). She is too powerful for them to control, and they try to kill her. Sil breaks out and, evolving into adult form ( Natasha Henstridge ), steals a train conductor's clothes and money. While they endeavor to track her down, the alien girl embarks on a blood-soaked quest for a mate...In 1960, the B.B.C. broadcast 'A For Andromeda', a six-part sci-fi serial by Fred Hoyle and John Eliot, which starred the then-unknown Julie Christie. It also concerned a beautiful young woman created by scientists from information sent from space. 'Species' owes it a great debt, as well as to the 1990's revival of 'The Outer Limits' and 'V' especially the character of Elisabeth the star child. Nudity abounds, but with Henstridge providing it who's complaining? The 'yuck' factor is high too, especially in the scene when the chrysalis in the train compartment spits out the adult Sil. 'Alien' creator H.R.Giger designed Sil's true alien form and, as you'd expect, its gross.Yes, this is a daft movie - sleazy and illogical by turns - but thoroughly enjoyable. Quality actors such as Kingsley and Alfred Molina give it a bit of a lift. Roger Donaldson, the director, was also responsible for the Pierce Brosnan disaster flick 'Dante's Peak'.Three sequels followed, of which I've only seen the second ( it was directed by Peter Medak and was simply appalling ).

The movie world was quite different back then, allowing a movie with a concept like this the chance to actually be released into theaters. And sure enough, the movie was a decent hit in the summer of 1995.The movie begins with what appears like a young girl being gassed while a bald man looks on sadly. But rather than die, the girl breaks out of the compound and escapes on a train a few dozen miles away. The bald man, Xavier, quickly gathers a team to track this young girl. The team includes an assassin, anthropologist, molecular biologist and an empath. As the young girl switches trains, Xavier explains to the team that the girl is the product of an alien signal explaining how to bind a sequence of DNA with human DNA. The girl soon goes into a cocoon and emerges later as a stunning adult that can metamorphosis in a monster. The team track her to LA and race to find her as she begins her search for a man to reproduce with, leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. Eventually, she discovers the team and fakes her own death in front of them, with the intent of mating with the assassin. But she instead ends up copulating with and killing the anthropologist before being discovered and chased by the team. They track her underground and after she kills Xavier, she births a fast growing baby. Shortly after, the baby is set ablaze and the team manages to blow the monster's head off and leave her to burn with her baby.The cast is the strongest part and their enthusiasm makes the movie work. Ben Kingsley does alright as Xavier and Michael Madsen plays his usual badass self as the assassin Press Lennox. Forrest Whitaker, for all his talents, is given some of the worst dialogue ever as the empath or psychic. Natasha Henstridge does alright as the oft naked space beauty. She doesn't really do much but that fits her part. And both Alfred Molina and Marg Helgenberger both do a good job in the roles they are given.The story isn't exactly anything new and borrows from a number of sources but as a whole, it works quite well. The monster effects, as designed by HR Giger, are magnificently executed, save for a few brief minutes of bad cgi at the end of the film. All in all, the movie is a decent sci-fi skin movie that does a number of things pretty good and a few things really well. It's the perfect example of how a b-movie concept can be successful if given the right cast with the right attitude.

The girl escapes and turns into Natasha Henstridge who wanders around Los Angeles looking for a mate. She wants to get pregnant because the alien part of her has been sent here to propagate and destroy the humans. The human part of her is already beginning to hear the ticking of her biological clock. All kinds of killings, near-copulations, and titillations follow.Let me get the members of the A team right. Ben Kingsley is the scientist responsible for the creation of Henstridge. Marg Helgenberger is maybe a clinical psychologist. Michael Madsen is the professional assassin for some government agency. Forest Whitaker is the empathic who is able to read emotional vibrations. Afred Molina is the goofy looking professor of anthropology from Harvard.I didn't care for Molina's character at all. I was a professor of anthropology for years and nobody ever paid for my drinks while pursuing anybody like Natasha Henstridge. Of course I wasn't a professor at HARVARD, just a state university, but still. On top of his being pampered by the government and everybody else, he's the one who gets to impregnate Henstridge. I was glad when she tore him apart.Of the other team members, I wondered what a fine actor like Ben Kingsley is doing in this slapdash lunge for the buck. Ditto Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger, both of whom have more to offer than what they're allowed to put on display here. Michael Madsen, I was happy to see, has the role of cynical hero, a change from his usual character whose sadistic traits, if they had a face, would resemble that of a Turkish pederast.I kind of enjoyed Natasha Henstridge, especially when she was naked, which is roughly half the time. Wow. She's a lissome, toothsome blond and very tall. When my mind wandered, as it tended to when she was clothed, I found myself wondering if, put together, she, Mariel Hemingway, and Uma Thurman might not provide the foundation for a decent girl's basketball team. What made the fantasy attractive was that they were playing the game dressed only in bikinis and high heels.Not that Henstridge is without problems, both as actress and character. Her role as alien who learns mostly from observing others, limits her speech to only a few lines. It's just as well, considering the way she delivers them. But her weakness as a thespian is more than made up for by her magnificent figure. We don't get to see enough of it, if you ask me.That's Henstridge the actress. The alien character has a different set of problems. First, she has a nasty temper. When her first victim is eager to impregnate her but she senses he has some heritable medical problem, she thrusts her tongue so far into his mouth that it comes out the back of his head. Now, that's overdoing it.She's in the Jacuzzi with prospect number two, both naked and about to do it, when the phone rings. He wants to interrupt the proceedings and answer it but she's anxious to get going. When he insists, she turns into her alien form and disarticulates him. The scene caused a horrifying flashback to my marriage.A few words about her alien form, which we get to see in its most revolting aspect at the climax. In the Jacuzzi, it assumes the kind of demonic form that is Judeo-Christian in nature. She looks like our usual conception of Satan, with vertical pupils and pointed ears. The origin of that figure is not from outer space, it's from the Middle East of thousands of years ago. I make this observation as your personal anthropologist. That will be fifteen cents. Or a billet doux from someone who looks just like Henstridge in her human form.But -- just listen to this special offer! For fifteen cents I will throw in the observation that in her FINAL form, in the sewer beneath the hotel, she shows distinctly mammalian characteristics -- her breasts, her hair (cf., the bride of Frankenstein), her reproductive organs -- and yet she retains certain reptilian traits, like scales, that natural selection should have dropped long ago. Moreover, some of her features seem to be either plastic or metal. What the hell kind of evolution do you call this? We evolve into creatures of plastic? And thermosets at that, because both the alien and her newborn baby fall into a lake of fire and that's that.Not that the movie misses the clichÃ© of the supposedly dead body leaping back into life -- or any of the other formulaic jolts we've come to expect from strictly commercial ventures like this. There are a multitude of CGIs, mostly disgusting slimy worm-like things that strangle people or suck out their brains and -- well, you get the picture. I'll mention the final clichÃ©. When the creature is destroyed and the team departs the field in victory, a bit of limp alien flesh is left behind. A sewer rat nibbles on it, then flashes out a tiny alien tongue and consumes another rat. This is the signal that there is to be a sequel -- Species II -- which followed apace.Ugh.

And the advertisements made me so scared that I thought if I went to the toilet, a tentacle would grab me and pull me down! Anyways, this was a Sci-Fi story about a half alien, half girl who was 12 years of age named 72100 or Sil (Michelle Williams). She was created in a lab in Utah, USA and she only grew up within a month. And soon, her creator Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) decided to gas her. Suddenly, she broke out of her glass container while she was being gassed and she ran. Phew! That girl was super strong and fit! Sil has these continuous dreams about being run over by some monster train and mating. And then, she would wake up and she was in trouble. For example, when she woke up after dreaming about being attacked by the monster train and some train hobo. She saw the train hobo (Scott McKenna) who was going to rape her. And she grabbed him by the neck, threw him across the room, he landed upside down and his neck snapped.When she got off the train the next day, she slipped onto another one and when she got on. She broke open a cupboard which had money in it and she took it and some food from the kitchen. You should've seen how she ate a banana. She first bites off the skin and then she ate the fruit which was inside.And on that night, Sil ate so much she spun into a cocoon. And soon, when the Female Conductor (Esther Scott) came to check on Sil. The Female Conductor went into the bathroom and saw a giant, pumping cocoon. And she was attack and Sil came out of the cocoon. She was fully grown. She was about 23 years of age.Not so soon, Fitch organizes a group in order to catch Sil. The group members were Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina), Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen), Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker) and Dr.Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger). And at the same time, Sil was getting off the train in Los Angeles, California. She was very beautiful. And she also took off the Female Conductor's credit card in order to survive.At a night club, Sil sure did get destructive due to seeing a man's wife with the man she loved and she killed the woman off when she went to the toilet. She later bumped into another guy at the nightclub called Robby (Anthony Guidera). She then went off with Robby to his house. And when she kissed him, her tongue shot out of his head! And she drove off in Robby's car while the gang were still checking out the place and the cops too. It seems Sil was keen on mating.After an accident, Sil went home with the guy who took her to the hospital named John Carey (Whip Hubley). And that evening, Sil drowned John in the jacuzzi when she sensed the people who were looking for her were at the front door.. And soon, the gang and the cops discovered the body.After the incident, Sil shot into a woman's car (Marliese Schneider) and she said she needed her help. At the woman's house, Sil tied up the woman to her bed. Sil then cut her thumb off and it grew back. The woman was so freaked out! Later, Sil set up a trap with tubs of petrol which led down the hill and with a power plant which was at the bottom of a hill. That evening, Sil got outside the nightclub, the cops and the gang followed her into the hills followed by the helicopters. Sil drove down the hill, she shot out of the car and she left the woman who she captured in the car. The woman died in a collision went the car hit the power plant. It was quite a sight to see with all those tubs of petrol exploding trying to destroy those helicopters! And from here, the gang, Fitch and the cops thought Sil was dead. Well, she wasn't.Soon, Sil reappeared with dyed hair. And she surprises Stephen when he entered his room. She then slept with him. While Dan was sleeping, he woke up and sensed that Sil was still alive. And then, Stephen was killed by Sil (Frank Welker). And the gang woke up and when they went into Stephen's room, they found him dead! And Sil headed for the sewer. WOW! She sure was fast moving! And she killed Fitch in a almost a split second! Sil hid away and she gave birth to her baby (Kurtis Burow). It was very interesting way of giving birth. The baby came out of Sil's stomach and she was still alive! And when Dan saw Sil's baby. It was a boy! But it was ONE NASTY BABY!!!! It shot out it's tongue and it ate a rat! And THEN!!!! It grew into a huge monster! And Dan killed it with a blow torch. And Preston threw Sil into a fire of flames and then he blew her head off! And to end the review, there was one COOL scene when a rat ate a tentacle of Sil's and then, its tongue shot out and it ate a rat which scoured around close by. HECTIC! This was a very well produced movie for a 90s film. And you should check out the effects on DVD!!! They are amazing!!

According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half? Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!)You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit.Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him as the non-scientist among us ... THE non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway.The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie.This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments.

When you make 5 million(theoretically) for THAT(this movie metaphor with bugger from Scarface who was going on 60 minutes)and don't deserve it, well, I can write anything I want, as long as it's accurate. Lost an hour of my life to this rubbish including this write-up, I can't imagine when I'll bust out this DVD again. I guess when I want to see her naked again?

From director Roger Donaldson (Dante's Peak), this film starts with a little girl, named Sil (Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams) inside a large see-through dome, and a few seconds later has a gas pumped in to kill her, and she obviously escapes. This girl is now on the run, and Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) has brought together a group of experts in their own ways to help exterminate the girl. This group consist of mercenary Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen) who is there only to kill something, anthropologist Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina), scientist Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger), and Empath (who can feel things, i.e. what another is feeling, their intention, their reason for something, and if they are close or where they have been recently) Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker). We discover that (obviously) this girl is not ordinary, she may look like a human, but behind closed doors and before a victim will be killed by her, she is a new species. Basically over many years the scientist satellites have been sent alien codes with instructions to join their DVA with humans, they tried this with five due babies, only one (Sil) was allowed to live. Anyway, Sil has now fully grown into a mature adult (introducing the attractive Natasha Henstridge), and learning more and more human traits, she is desperate now to find a healthy human man to help her breed, in other words, with her increased speed of growth, she wants to make a baby. The film consists mainly of loads of chases, alien deaths, near misses and quite a bit of nudity, till eventually Stephen is victim to her conception, and death of course, and finale sees all surviving characters tracking the now hideous looking creature down underground. The special effects may not be absolutely superb, but they are pretty cool in moments, and I found Whitaker's character a little weird, even though he is helpful in the story, and a great actor, so in whole, quite a good once in awhile film. Worth watching!

While what ever the producers wanted to achieve with this movie, I think they missed big time. A space mission accidentally brings back some alien virus or something, and it infects people with a magic goop that can spray over distances. This is bit of a rip off from the other older sci-fi movie The Thing. Except The Thing did a little better job of it. In order to sell the movie there was a young good looking 20 something blond girl who was infected and under alien control had no regard for clothes. But while there is nudity and sexual acts in the movie, it is not graphic enough to save this R-rated bomb. If one wants to see a movie with sex, why not drop all pretenses and just get a porno. Not only did I regret the money I spent on renting this movie, this was one a the few time that i regretted taking the time to watch it all the way through. The sequel was no better. And they actually made a SpeciesIII?

It's harder to determine the second biggest idiocy - there's more competition - but my preferred candidate is the scene where the scientists (so called) decide to put some alien DNA in a test tube with a few millilitres of some liquid or other in order to see what happens.  Nothing happens.  -No, that's what would have happened if I'd been director.  Actually, within seconds, they have a giant brown squid that threatens to overwhelm the world.  What was the giant squid made out of? Where did all the matter come from?  (And given its casual lack of concern for laws of physics and biochemistry, why was it so unscary?)Species is rife with such idiocies and clumsily made to boot.  I'll admit that Natasha Henstridge's body is worth seeing; but even here there are problems.  For one thing, if we're going to see her naked so often, then I'd rather she were the heroine.  It's as if the director thought that sexiness is a kind of cinematic sin, which can be atoned for only by violence and angst.  I feel quite strongly about this matter.  Casual, jeu d'esprit erotica I have no quarrel with.  The Hollywood idea that sex and nudity belong in the dark, with a false air of dead seriousness and the hypocritical pretence that some deep dramatic end is being served, I do have a quarrel with.  More boobs.  Fewer razor blades.

It does have some campy, run-of-the-mill scary moments that build up enough momentum for an occasional shock moment, and even some squirming at the gore. But all of the film's terror is smothered in its high self-esteem and the character's unconvincing motives. The movie thinks that a lot of kinky sex, copious amounts of gore, and a complex and arguable  plot can save it from its own lack of focusing on the chase, and it fails as a result. 	The movie takes place in pretty much present day. A research clinic in search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence receives a signal detailing some kind of alien structure of DNA. The complicated story line soon makes it quite clear that the movie will transform a sexy young woman into a blood thirsty monster who is desperate to become pregnant so it can breed. This beast is called Sil, who brutally kills many people in search for a mating partner. 	All of this nonsense can be thanked by a no-nonsense scientist named Xavier Fitch (funny how the cartoon character on the children's television series The X Men, has the same name, hair style, look, attitude, and deep voice). This man sentences a band of police and mercenaries to locate this monster and destroy it. 	The film eventually lacks scary material and an actual reason to see it. There is too little going for the film, besides a few nice special effects. But as for star power, reputation or genre, this is a pale wannabe. The cast here, including some very big and highly commendable names, Ben Kingsly, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, and Natasha Henstridge, all are quite good in their roles, but their characters are seriously flawed. Take the Ben Kingsly character for instance, someone so obsessed and determined with morbid ideas it is hard to feel any kind of empathy for him. The context of Species may have had a chance at being something effective if the characters had been better written.Species is the kind of horror thriller that will surely be remembered for some time to come--even though it is not a good movie. The film offers so much for adult audiences though; the cast, the occasional suspenseful atmosphere, the controversial subject matter, the popular and good looking cast, and the list continues. Since the film's release in 1995, there has been a sequel that followed in an attempt to keep audiences in remembrance of this production. But the filmmakers' attempts have been mostly unsuccessful--mainly due to the fact that there simply is not a whole lot about this film that deserves to be remembered.

A group of characters are contacted to try and track the creature now but it has taken the form of a beautiful woman (Natasha Henstridge) with the intent to reproduce. SPECIES is certainly a step above your run-of-the-mill science fiction tale because it's smart enough to know that it's dealing with an interesting subject but it has to be more than just brains so the screenplay throws out some wild exploitation elements and in the end we're left with a pretty entertaining B movie. I think the best thing going for the film is that it's really not scared to be out there in terms of its sexuality and violence. A lot of the credit has to go to Henstridge and her beauty. Yes, they could have gotten any model for this part but the actress here actually goes the extra mile because she's quite believable in the quieter scenes where the species is trying to figure out her life and what's her purpose on this new planet. I thought the actress did a remarkable job but what's even more important is that she wasn't shy about the nude scenes and there are many. The sexuality level of this film and her character are quite high and this here really isn't something you saw much of during this period of mainstream movies. The willingness really adds to the sexual nature of the film and this is a plus for the viewer. The supporting performances are all quite good with each of the actors fitting their roles nicely. Former Oscar-winner Kingsley has no problems with the nerdy scientist and Michael Madsen certainly knows how to play bad. You can't help but think he would have been the perfect noir actor had he been around in the 40s and 50s but he brings that toughness to today's L.A. and it really works. Alfred Molina, Marg Helgenberger and future Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker round out the cast. A young Michelle Williams plays the creature in its child form. I think the screenplay has a few intelligent ideas about reproduction and DNA but at the same time it never gets too complicated and instead just throws one murder or action scene at us after another. I think the film's major flaw is that it runs way too long at 110-minutes so some editing would have done it a lot of good. With that said, for a 90s movie to be about a beautiful, sexual alien trying to reproduce, this one here hits a home run and delivers the goods for fans of exploitation.

She, 'Sil' escapes from her creators.  A crack team is put together to track her down and kill her before she can breed and start a new race on earth.This is a interesting idea - unfortunately it's wasted on this.  A good idea in this film is about as welcome as a life raft in the desert.  The main problem is that the aim of the film is not to be a good sci-fi but rather to make a star of Henstridge and get her to be naked as often as possible.....and that's it!  The action is mixed and the actual alien confrontation is poor.  And of course, being a low rent horror - this ends with the usual it's not over until the sequel style ending (unnecessary since the sequel didn't use this!).The cast are great on paper but poor onscreen.  How did so many good people get together to be in this bit of nudity-driven fluff?  Kingsley, Whitaker, Molina, Helgenberger - all good actors (oh - Michael Madsen's in there too - not really a surprise).  However they're wasted on poor dialogue and silly characters, simply because the film doesn't want to take too much time away from the promise of seeing Henstridge's breasts.  Great.Overall this is a silly horror film that wastes a good premise and a great cast.  When it comes down to it this is little better than erotic dramas that use a stupid plot as an excuse for nudity - only Species had a bigger budget.  God knows why! "}]
