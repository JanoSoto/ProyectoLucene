[{"Title":"A Small Masterpiece","Date":"7 July 1999","Score":"18 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  La Promesse is one of the best films of this decade. With its simple style and character-driven plot, one may think that the film comes from one of the Dogma 95 manifesto directors but it doesn't. The film's strengths lie in its theme of morality and responsibility and in its no-nonsense portrayal of the immigrant situation in Belgium (with reverberations reaching all across Europe). One can say that it's a coming-of-age tale--and in some ways it is--but when one thinks of the usual film categorized as such, the moniker doesn't match. Even the scene where Igor is being seduced by an older woman, while his father and his father's girlfriend look on, has no follow-up, no clumsy bedroom scene where we see Igor lose his virginity. The film makers just cut from the seduction scene in the bar to Igor the next morning back to his job at the dilapidated building site. Clearly, the directors are unconcerned with the staples of the coming-of-age genre. More precisely, I think it should be called a coming-of-conscience film. The final scene is at the same time heartbreaking and thought-provoking. The way they end the movie is a masterstroke because it forces the viewer to ponder what will come next, thus prompting self-reflective questions on what the viewer himself or herself would have chosen to do.

The movie avoids sentimentality or overt analysis - it s a highly respectful portrait of tumultuous actions in a very specific, eye-openingly grim sector of low life. The boy's relationship with the father is satisfyingly rounded - accommodating obvious mutual affection despite the outbursts of violence and the terrible paternal example set overall - and the portrayal of the woman is culturally precise and fascinating. A fine film, balancing enormous relevance with proper mystery.

It's amazing how little has changed in a hundred years.La Promesse, a Belgian film by the Dardenne brothers, offers so little of the American drama-enhancers that at first it seems boringly mundane.  But an interesting morality-play soon puts the viewer's mind to work.  What is the main character, Igor, a street-wise kid supposed to do when his father, who has taught him every trick in the book, hides the accidental death of an illegal immigrant worker?  Igor promises the worker's wife that he will look after her and her baby while her husband has gone missing but is unable to tell her the horrible truth.Igor contemplates what to do, oftentimes while driving around a ghastly post-industrial landscape on his rickety moped.  No music, just moped whining.  In typical Dardenne style, there is a brief touching and funny scene in all of this misery.  Igor is filmed actually having fun with his pals in a pitifully dilapidated, home-made go-cart -like all kids should- rather than contemplating such weighty issues.  The effect is unforgettable.Igor finally decides to make a break with his father and in a common but effective convention -- he uses the survival tactics that his father taught him (such as driving their van) against him, leaving the fat-ish father to go after his kid while squeezing onto his kid's moped.  Truly a pathetic sight.Igor, his hand played with his father, is now forced to confront the issue with the worker's widow and her baby which makes for a powerful conclusion. Sans music, of course.Without entirely giving up the movie, the title, La Promesse actually has two meanings it seems.  The first is the promise to the woman and her baby but the directors evidently are also rooting for the promise of a younger (post-baby boomer) generation to act altruistically.  I'm reminded of the line in a John Cougar Mellencamp (baby-boomer) song, Check it Out, when he sings wistfully, Future generations...maybe they'll have a better understanding, Hopefully have a better understanding...In a sad coda, I saw La Promesse in Washington DC's last independent theater just days before it closed down, thus losing it's battle with the evil theater-chain empires.  Movies like La Promesse are the kinds of films that allow one to restore the promise that there can still be thoughtful and unforgettable cinema out there in the land of formulaic Hollywood pap.  These films need to be made and offered in our theaters and video stores...and taught in our film schools.  They do more than entertain. They offer a window on life.  If they can't survive in the movie market, then (oh-no, the s-word) subsidize them and use them as teaching instruments to our students.  Maybe future generations will revive the art -- and learn something in the process.

In 1992 they finished their second one, Je pense à vous (I Think About You) which they didn't think as a good film. After four years, came their first real Dardenne-film The Promise. It was the first film where they found their own unique style. The Promise is a story of a father son relationship, which they had already dealt with in Falsch.Roger (Olivier Gourmet), with his 15-year-old son Igor (Jérémie Renier), drives across industrial Belgium to get illegal immigrants from a truck. They bring them back to a block of flats they live in and start charging them for money. One of the immigrants is Assita who has come to Belgium with her husband to find a better future for them and their baby. One day when immigrant-inspectors pay a visit events start to have radical consequences.The films by the Dardenne brothers usually focus on the moral choices the characters have to make and what are the consequences. In The Promise Igor has to decide, whether to obey his father or to do what's right and help Assita. Then we get to the question what is the right thing to do? And this is what Luc & Jean-Pierre Dardenne want to do let us observe and think. Luc Dardenne has said that the basic idea of film-making is to reconstruct new humane experiences. The Promise makes one think about these moral dilemmas and social issues but also associate the events with one's own life.Geographically Belgium is in between of Germany and France - Belgium is only a country for trespassing. For instance a harsh example; Hitler in WWII. This is the main theme of The Promise - it is a story of trespassing. For Assita Belgium is a metaphor of a certain state in life, which she is just passing by. No one stays in Belgium (or in that state of life).As is Assita in between of two worlds; her home country and Belgium, so is Igor. Igor feels himself grown-up when he's collecting taxes for his father and driving around Belgium. But on the other hand he's full of juvenile joy as he drives with his friends on a go-kart. Igor was played by Jérémie Renier (L 'Enfant, Lorna's Silence). It was his first role and through that he brought a realistic life to the character who tries to free himself from the chains of his father - the brothers have always appreciated the idea of using amateur actors. Igor's father, Roger was played by the Golden Palm-winner Olivier Gourmet, who is in my opinion a very talented actor. He gives a great life to Roger, whose world is worthless and merciless.The Dardenne brothers were raised in an industrial town in Belgium, which is the milieu in all of their films. The sound scape is something that one should pay attention to. There's no musical score at all only the voices the characters hear, the voices of an industrial town - ambiance. In the end the industrial voices just keep going on as the credits come on the screen. It's like we can't handle them anymore, they're spreading off the screen. A bit like in Chaplin's City Lights.The minimalist style of The Promise is amazing. It's touching on a new level. The brothers have totally succeed in their mission to create new humane experiences. Luc Dardenne writes in his 'diary' Behind Our Pictures, that the more you take material away the closer you get to the humane emotions, which he achieves through the severe aesthetics, minimalism and ruthless sound scape.Faces are in an important role, when describing humane emotions in The Promise the faces have also a dramaturgical role. I'm going to quote Luc Dardenne here, translated in English In every scene with Igor and Assita where they look to each other, Igor is always the first to turn his head away. Igor isn't able to meet Assita's eyes, because he senses a moral command that he cannot reply. Except in the final scene. And what a redemption it is in the end. The meaning of facial expressions and the philosophy behind it comes from a French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, who both of the brothers admire and from whom they get background for their philosophy of film.The Promise is thinking - philosophy of film. The brothers have stabilized film as an instrument for philosophy. I hope that the true film fanatics get to see this and appreciate it as much as I do. In addition to its themes of change, father-son relationship and trespassing, The Promise challenges the viewer to think on its own. The brothers force us to meet the moral choices out there.

I remember thinking, another hand-held camera job, this time set in the backstreets of a Belgian industrial city - yet another rite of passage tale - unprepossessing youth steals a pensioner's handbag from a car in the garage where he works, while his father, a squint-eyed, piggy-faced fatty, runs a racket fleecing illegal immigrants from the Balkans and Africa.  However what is wholly remarkable about La Promesse is the way it slowly sucks the viewer into a realisation that this is not just a piece of documentary-style realism but an uncompromisingly honest study of character and conscience.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that no other film new to British TV last year moved or excited me as much.  The performance by Jeremie Renier as the youth Igor is a tour-de-force.  He is on screen for practically the entire film and it is his search for integrity after a dying African (one of his father's clients) exacts from him a promise to assist his wife and baby, that forms the work's core.  Igor has to come to terms with alienating his father, who, although a selfish and dishonest brute, has real affection for his son; parental/filial warmth is displayed when they drunkenly sing together in a cafe.  But what the film finally says with such devestating certainly is that even integrity is something that can go unappreciated and ignored by the one towards whom it is intended.  The ending speaks of a terrible price paid for redemption.

Unlike the similarly themed dogme movement, or the more iconic works of Lars von Trier etc, the Dardenne brothers are unconcerned with changing the face of cinematic reality, but rather, take their cue from people like Ken Loach, Bruno Dumont and Robert Bresson; by creating honest, often-bleak works of film that take their character from despair, to hope, and sometimes, right back to despair, in order to give the audience a taste of a world away from the more comfortable social milieu we might be accustomed to. The concept could be read as hypocritical admittedly, and although the occasional heavy-handed quality of the brother's work does intermittently become preachy, there is ample opportunity to deliver some moments of earth-shattering drama.I first encountered the Dardenne's work back in 2001, when British film channel Film Four premiered their film The Promise (1996) in preparation for the premier of their highly acclaimed follow up film Rosetta (1999). Both films are here are heavily indebted to the naturalistic/realist work of Bresson and Loach, particularly films like Diary of a Country Priest (1951), Riff Raff (1990) and Raining Stones (1993); with the filmmakers presenting the viewer with a series of characters continually forced to the brink of despair, but desperate to pull themselves back. For me, out of the two films of theirs that I have thus far seen, The Promise is the one that makes the greatest impact. Here, The Dardenne's create a world that isn't a million miles away from the current social climate in the UK, with building sites, smoky pubs and migrant workers peppering what is essentially the typical rites-of-passage/coming of age movie so familiar even by Hollywood standards. The brothers rest their narrative firmly on the shoulders of young newcomer Jérémie Rénier as Igor, a teenage tearaway forced into looking after a young black mother and her baby following the death of the woman's husband whilst working for the company run by Igor's father.The brothers season their film with an abundance of topical, moralistic issues such as the passage into adulthood, immigration and domestic abuse, but at the centre of the drama there is still room for hope in the touching father son relationship between Igor and his disparate dad (played here by award winning actor and regular Dardenne collaborator Olivier Gourmet). The Promise might not be a ground-breaking film; its ideas are well worn and its scenarios familiar from the classic kitchen-sink cinema of films like Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) and A Taste of Honey (1961) to name only two, but the process of refinement that the brothers are able to create with the subtle shading of characters and the no-nonsense approach to film-making is really quite affecting on the most personal and emotional of levels.

His father dominates Igor's entire life; that is until Amidou, one of the workers is accidentally killed...

But the cinema of the latter is more realist and matter-of-fact. Furthermore, it evokes Ken Loach's with a difference if Ken Loach presents the pains of Western society by introducing humor, it isn't the same thing with the Dardenne brothers where humor is absent.For the promise, the Dardenne brothers opted for neutrality and sobriety short and quick dialogs, a film that essentially relies on the characters' gestures and countenances, no music, a vivid and rough directing that often shows the actors with back turned and especially a will to show a bleak social reality (the migrant workers' exploitation) and for this the movie almost takes a documentary aspect. The authors don't pass judgment, they don't feel pity. They just take a gritty and harsh look on these emigrants who live in dilapidated flats with a starvation wage. Besides, we can take down a significant detail their hard living conditions echoes to a gray sky and it gives to the film a dull atmosphere.An important point of the film is the relationship between Igor and his father. The beginning of the film presents a relationship between a father and his son that we could describe as complicity. At this moment, the movie becomes tinged with tenderness. But throughout the movie, this complicity gradually turns into an open opposition and the consequences of Igor's promise open his eyes on his fathers' cruelty.The promise is also a movie that includes powerful moments because the suggested has the edge on the showed Hammidou's mortal accident, the very last sequence of the movie when Igor decides to reveal the truth to Assita about her husband (we don't see her face but the simple view of her bent back makes us suggest her sadness.The performance is also remarkable.

It may well be noted that the freres Dardennes tend to load the dice in their own favor but there are times when a case can be made for playing with a stacked deck and this is one of them. Not too much happens. We meet Igor (Jeremie Regnier) and his father Roger (Olivier Gourmet) almost from Frame #1. Teenage Igor, pumping gas is not above stealing a purse from an elderly lady and if we find this a tad amoral it is as nothing compared to his old man who has a nice line in illegal immigrants, demanding their passports - or rather delegating Igor to collect them - in return for a few square meters of squalor and a fifty-fifty chance of deportation if and when they prove unable and/or unwilling to pay the extortionate 'rent'. The first and literal promise is the one made by Igor to the African who has fallen from a ladder whilst renovating the clapped-out house owned by Roger and is subsequently finished off by Roger lest his injuries prove an embarrassment. The injured man charges Igor with being responsible for the welfare of his wife and child and Igor, being still impressionable, takes this seriously, so much so, that he severs relations with his father thus bringing into play the secondary meaning of the title, the promise shown by Igor of getting under the wire as a human being.

So I then decided to watch some of their earlier films and 'La Promesse' seemed like a good place to start as this is widely considered to be their breakout film.'La Promesse' has so many of the directorial and thematic content that I found in 'Two Days, One Night'. There is a clear sense of moral dilemma that is existent in both the films. In 'La Promesse', the protagonist is made to face this dilemma, while in 'Two Days, One Night', it's the supporting characters that are made to face the same for the majority of the film. Another similarity is the extremely simple storyline in the screenplay. But what makes both the films special is the stripped down and brutally unflashy style of direction and storytelling and a conscious effort by the Dardennes to give all the importance to the characters instead of the plot which binds them. In both the films, the plot moved me, but what bowled me over was the incredibly humane and endearing nature with which the Dardennes treated the characters.Although 'La Promesse' at the basic level is a character study of Igor and his character arc, but the Dardennes manage to weave in and explore some very universal and substantial issues. One of these issues is racism. We can easily see and observe the prejudice that the character of Assita faces from some of the Belgian citizens due to the colour of her skin. The other big issue that gets explored is the matter of immigration. This is an issue whose significance hasn't receded even a bit from 1996 to 2016. It is still an issue which divides the ordinary people, politicians and countries. Although the Dardennes don't make a huge statement on this issue, but they do depict the grim reality and the exploitation that comes along with it.The father and son relationship between Roger and Igor provides the backbone for the film. Roger is a big, burly man who brings immigrants to Belgium illegally and then exploits them for his own gains and benefits. He also has a influence on his son Igor. Igor does whatever he wants him to do. Igor has to take leave from his apprenticeship work and also is forced to curtail his playing time with his friends whenever his father summons him. He has to help Roger in his work which involves exploiting the immigrants. So, in a simplified sense Roger is the villain in the film who has an overbearing presence. Thematically he is a dark shadow that Igor is living under and the viewer would want Igor to have a moral awakening and rebel against his father. But the Dardennes give Roger one likable quality that makes him somewhat redeemable. His love for his son Igor seemed genuine to me. There are some scenes in the film which Roger and Igor share which are genuinely sweet and adorable especially the karaoke scene. So Roger is still a bad presence in Igor's life and his flaws outweigh his redeeming qualities, but his love for his son lifts him from being a generic villain to being an interesting, flawed individual. The actor Olivier Gourmet deserves a lot of praise for his pitch perfect portrayal of this flawed man. Another great performance comes from Assita Ouedraogo. This is a fiery performance. She exudes a great amount of strength that is also expressed through the fire in her eyes. If I have any reservation with the film, though being a nitpick, it will be Jérémie Renier's performance as Igor. He is not bad at all. As a matter of fact in certain emotional scenes, he is genuinely good and forces the viewer to feel empathy for him. However in some of the quieter scenes, his facial expressions seemed a bit artificial and flat to me. But I'll have to restate that he is still good as Igor. There are just certain scenes where I thought his performance could have been slightly better. The Dardennes' subtle and nuanced style of storytelling which involves the lack of any musical score whatsoever makes 'La Promesse' a very realistic portrayal of moral awakening. Immigration and Racism are a part of the plot, but there isn't a heavy-handed treatment of these issues. Just like 'Two Days, One Night', the ending of the film is absolutely perfect. It is by no means a happy ending. But it still is an ending that is subtly ornamented with an underlying sense of hope and optimism for the future.

The topic of illegal immigration is controversial in many western countries and this movie indicates that not only do illegals have a tough time on the job, but they are also not welcome among the general citizenry, as illustrated here by an illegal being urinated on and having her possessions trashed. But the plight of the immigrants is a subplot, since the focus is on Roger's son Igor who works for his dad. Initially Igor seems to be following in Roger's footsteps as we see him execute a scheme to steal a woman's money from her car in such a casual way that we think we know the path his life will take. The genius of the movie has Igor experience a sequence of events that make him question his moral values, or, more accurately, the lack of such. Ultimately Igor's maturing sense of morality causes him to act in ways that put him in serious conflict with his father.A lot of gray areas are explored. Roger does love Igor and at one point says that everything he does is for his son. If there is truth in that, then Roger adheres to the philosophy that the end justifies the means and he has allowed himself to be blinded to the humanity of his workers. Roger's behavior is a small scale version of attitudes that have been responsible for many of the world's biggest horrors. In showing Igor's struggle with moral questions the Dardenne brothers seem to be making a case that morality is in part genetic and must serve an evolutionary purpose--Igor's upbringing would argue against his turning on his father. In the final scene did Igor make the right decision in being so honest? Could he not have withheld the most brutal fact? The ending left me wanting to know what happened next. Filmed with muted colors, no musical score, a grim urban background, and little comic relief, this is not for those looking for light entertainment.

It was about as far from a Hollywood-style film as you can get! The story involves some pretty nasty characters. In particular, a teenage boy and his father. They make money by exploiting illegal immigrants in France--picking up the poor people and housing them in a tenement--all as exorbitant rates. This pair appear to be people without souls as they lie and cheat again and again. However, when one of these illegals accidentally dies, the paths of the two diverge. Dad just wants to dump the body and could care less about the man's widow and young child (wanting to sell her into a life of prostitution), while the boy who witnessed the final words of the dying man promised to look after the family. What, exactly, happened next I'll leave for the viewer. Provided you have a tolerance for movies about realistically seedy people, this is a film worth seeing.An interesting twist, not taken in the film, would have been if later the boy had found out that his father was not really his biological dad--but the dad raised him from infancy after his own real family died while being smuggled into France by him. This could be an interesting path.

That's when I hit STOP and ditched the DVD.I'm supposed to sympathize with this young widow (as the synopsis describes her), when she bought a sweet, gentle creature just so she can kill it to satisfy some demonic bloodthirsty god, or whatever? I assume that's what the chicken is for, too. Why did those people even bother sneaking into Belgium if they intended to bring their barbaric customs with them? Why didn't they just stay in Africa?Since the movie hinges on Igor's sympathy for her, there's no point in my waiting around to see if they actually show the slaughter, because I already couldn't care less what happens to that woman. I liked some of the Dardennes' later movies a lot, but if I'd seen this one first I never would have bothered with the others.I know every single person who reads this review will mark it Not useful, with a warm surge of righteous artistic indignation (and even more righteous anti-American indignation when they see where I'm writing from) as they click the No button.Good for you. You're a great champion of free artistic expression and the rights of the world's downtrodden masses - as long as the views being expressed agree with yours and the downtrodden masses are human beings and not innocent defenseless animals. Your world loves you, but I don't have to. "},{"Title":"Belgian immigration problems","Date":"5 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  The brothers Dardenne understand how to tell a story without narration.  The characters in this movie are strong enough to develop their own lines and short dialogues without commentary.  There is no music or sound. The problem of this movie is apparent to Baran (2001) but in a different context and country.  The style is near to La Vie de Jésus (1997) by Bruno Dumont and the hardness of life close to Seul contre Tous (1998) by Gaspar Noé.  Those last two movies have something more in common they are situated in the old industrial country of the north of France and the south of Belgium. One could explore a stylistic nearness to Ken Loach but the narration goes deeper.  It is the sole existence of mankind who is put into question.  Father, why do we live?  Igor (Jérémie Rénier) seems to ask continuously to his father Roger (Olivier Gourmet).  This film is a good attempt to make something as Belgian social realism without a parade or a revolution by the workers.  They seem now to be more isolated (some exception Fermeture des usines Renault à Vilvoorde (1998)) and confined to villages with a non-existing working-class. The unemployed seem to have replaced the workers.        A strange situation happens when Assita goes to a clairvoyant to know what happened with Amadou and the answer will be as cryptic as the situation wherein she is.  Is the promise that Igor made (in fact it was his father) so important?  The movie seems to suggest that a 14-year old boy could change the situation and ameliorate the fate of Assita. The real problem is that illegal immigration is a crime that has many consequences and at least it creates innumerable problems when something happens and it is a waste for the society and what more is, it puts the illegal workers into great danger because they come into the hands of people without conscience or humanity.
