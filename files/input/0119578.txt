That one is a dancer, a lawyer, a choreographer, etc. is unimportant. They are 8 gay men whose lives are intertwined in love, valour, and compassion.Jason Alexander is very good in the Nathan Lane role, the portly man dying of AIDS who, late in life finds love. John Glover is brilliant (repeating his Tony-winning role) as twins one a nasty hateful man; the other a sweet man whose death from AIDS is imminent. Stephen Spinella and John Benjamin Hickey are solid as the yuppie long-term couple. Stephen Bogardus is warm as the stuttering host, Justin Kirk is surprisingly good as the blind man, and Randy Becker is good as the Latino hunk whose causes so much trouble.The film is full of stereotypes and warm humor and terrific moments of truth. This is not a revolutionary film that tries to change the world, but it is a wise and bittersweet look at the lives of gay men in the time of AIDS, men whose lives are shattered (and ended) by a cruel and heartless disease.There's nothing earth-shattering here, no insights that make the lives of gay men clear and understandable to non-gays. But it is a work of great honesty and simplicity in showing 8 gay men as.... human beings.The scene, when the men go skinnydipping under a summer moon is beautiful in its complete innocence. No viewer can fail to understand their childlike glee in such a simple pleasure.This film is a must see just because it is not a strident, political rant against the horrors of AIDS. The characters, especially those played by Glover and Alexander, accept their fates with great dignity, humor, and valour. This film is a great tribute to all our victims of AIDS, and a silent condemnation to the society and politics that let it happen.

Yes - the gay men approach stereotypical roles in some instances, but they are developed over the course of the summer in a manner that mimics the boys in Stand by Me.  We see the changes in the relationships between nearly every pairing of the eight men.  Some are in relationships; some were.  Some hate each other; but they nearly all care about one another.  This is the kind of movie that makes you reflect on your own human interactions.  You don't have to be HIV+, a choreographer, a yuppie, a broadway queen, or even gay to see yourself in these characters.  This is a fine exhibition of love, lust, friendship, and life.

Self Pity!!!","Date":"3 January 2010","Score":"8 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is perhaps the most inappropriately named movie ever! There is no Love, there is no Valor, and there is no Compasion. Let's try this instead Self Centered!, Shallow!, Headonistic! I saw this film when it came out in 1997 and as the credits rolled in the theater I wanted to crawl into a hole and pull the hole in after me. Last night I caught parts of it again on cable and immediately started having PTSD symptoms. What a giant pant load. As a gay male, and ballet dancer myself, I cringe to think that people out there might see this vapid movie and think that my life in any way resembles it or any of it's pathetic inhabitants. Sorry to take this personally... This is not a movie about people, gay or otherwise, and their struggles or triumphs. It's about gay cartoon characters. And not very nice ones. Every distasteful stereotype is there. And most of the characters are several all at once. What do they have in common? They are all shallow, self centered, bitchy, immature, and totally lacking in impulse control, which explains the last thing they all have in common, they are all dying of AIDS. And so we have one of two problems here. Either gays are now making movies that perpetuate commonly held negative stereotypes about themselves, in which we have a movie and gay problem. Or, these aren't stereotypes and we gays are really like the way this movie portrays us, in which we have only a gay problem. Either way this movie is just one big problem from start to finish because it's loaded with bad movie making and bad gay characters. When The Boys in the Band opened in the 1960's the gay community, of which Terrence McNally had to have been a part of at the time, was outraged at it's negative portrayal of gay men as stereotypically sad, self loathing, and bitchy. Whatever Mr. McNally's perspective was back then he clearly thinks that stereotypically sad, self loathing, and bitchy was the way to go thirty years later in 1997, and that AIDS would somehow ameliorate the subjects' distastefulness. Not even close. More importantly, all the personal and sociological offenses aside, this is just a really bad, unenjoyable, movie. The house and landscape are beautiful but there is no one to like or care for anywhere to be found. Like too many gay films it trades on shallowness, bitchiness, nudity,and the promise of easy sex. Those can be elements of a film, but they can't BE the film. Follow this if you will. One of the many subplotlines threaded throughout this movie the cute blind guy screws around on his partner, in their own home, with one of their guests, then gets a phone call that his sister had died and launches into an overacted banshee like scream that makes you think he might also be mentally disabled. Then while his lover is comforting him due to the loss of his sister, the cute blind guy thinks it's the perfect time to be honest and tell his lover that he has been schtupping the house guest. And this is fairly routine for this script and this group of characters. And this is not treated like a plot development. It's just one of many random moments, clich√©s, and stereotypes thrown into this shepherds pie of undeveloped stories and characters. Uhgg...And as for the brain trust behind all this, if this is what passes for talented playwriting and movie making by the gay establishment, God help us all.

Though I have not had the pleasure of seeing a theatrical production of this film, I do own the play and have read it numerous times.  Although the film did suffer a tiny bit from some things being edited out, characters speaking directly to the audience, further character insight etc., it is still a wonderful film, full of superb acting and characters that you fall in love with.The characters are brought to life with superb accuracy, due to the fact that all the actors, except Nathan Lane, reprise their roles that they held on the stage for about all of two years.  And it shows that they have bonded as artists with both each other and their characters.As with almost all films there were performances that personally stood out to me.  John Glover shows the audience why he won the Tony Award for his performance.  Playing twin brothers, 'John the Foul and James the Fair' showing the defination of range.  The other actor that really stood out was the always brilliant Justin Kirk, playing the young, blind Bobby Brahms, showing why he won the OBIE Award for his spectacular performance.  The cast also includes Stephen Spinella, two time Tony award winner for Tony Kushner's masterpiece Angels in America, Jason Alexander, and many other actors that deserve much more recognition and fame than they currently have.This is a beautiful film with precious characters that you will love.

The fact that it's basically the same team that produced this moving theater piece at New York's Manhattan Theater Club and later transferred to Broadway with basically the same cast, and with the same director, Joe Mantello, doesn't give the film viewer any idea of what Love, Valor, Compassion was so effective on the theater in comparison what one watches this version on the screen.First, and foremost, the replacement of Nathan Lane, the originator of the role of Buzz was the first mistake. In fact, Jason Alexander, a good actor otherwise, throws away the balance of the film as he portrays Buzz. Mr. Alexander is out of his element in the movie. He seems to be acting in a different film, rather on this one.The rest of the brilliant cast is repeating the roles they originated on the play.Love, Valor, Compassion deals with a lot of serious topics in a matter of fact way. AIDS is at the center of the story as this group is affected deeply in one way, or another, by the plague that is killing most of these men gathered at a summer house. There is also a subtext in the movie about relationships, friendship, and loyalty.John Glover playing the twin brothers, John, and James, gives one of his best performances in this picture. Mr. Glover is an actor who has a long background in both theater and films and he is a welcome addition to anything he decides to grace with his presence.Stephen Spinella and John Benjamin Hickey, are Perry and Arthur, a gay couple that has managed to stay together fourteen years, a record for this type of life where relationships tend not to last at all. Stephen Bogardus and Justin Kirk, are Gregory and Bobby, the host of the house and his sweet blind lover. Randy Becker plays Ramon, who appears to be a hustler and has been brought as a guest and ends up betraying his companion and the host.Finally, the fact the film doesn't work rests with the direction of Joe Mantello, an excellent theater director for casting the wrong man in a key part in the movie and perhaps his unfamiliarity working in films.

VALOUR! COMPASSION! Aspect ratio 1.851Sound format Dolby DigitalThis perceptive drama - written by Terrence McNally, adapted from his award-winning Broadway play - starts out as a warm-hearted examination of the lives and loves of eight middle-class gay men during three eventful weekends at the isolated country home of ageing dancer Stephen Bogardus and his blind, youthful boyfriend Justin Kirk (ANGELS IN America). As it progresses, however, McNally's snappy screenplay begins to expose the faults in his principal characters, as well as their virtues, leading inevitably to fireworks and revelations. Set in a beautiful lakeside house somewhere in upstate New York (filmed in Quebec, though you wouldn't know it), director Joe Mantello - also responsible for the original Broadway production - and cinematographer Alik Sakharov take full advantage of the area's natural beauty, moulding a defiantly cinematic template from the material's inherent staginess.All but one of the fine ensemble cast was culled from the stage version, including Stephen Spinella and John Benjamin Hickey as a staid yuppie couple, and Randy Becker (LIE DOWN WITH DOGS) as the handsome young stud whose overt sex appeal creates emotional tension in a household dominated by middle-aged men. However, the film is virtually stolen by Seinfelds Jason Alexander (in a role essayed by Nathan Lane on-stage) as the archetypal Broadway-loving queen who lives in fear of his HIV status and masks his anxiety with outrageous humor, and John Glover in dual roles as English twins, one of them noble and humane (and dying of an AIDS-related illness), the other a mean-tempered bitch of the highest order. McNally's script finds something deeper than mere stereotype in these disparate characters, and he examines the many ways in which they love each other, despite their differences. The full-frontal nudity which characterized the original stageplay (causing a minor stir at the time) has been toned down for the film, but not completely erased, and Becker in particular seems entirely at ease during his frequent nude scenes.

It probably loses even more when seen on home video or (even worse) broadcast on television with commercial interruption. The intimate tone of the story requires the attention one gives to a performance on a stage.There is an advantage, of course, to filming The actual surroundings can be used, rather than the best facsimile that can be achieved on stage. So what the film lacks in intimacy, it makes up for somewhat with the realism of the location, which is practically a character itself.The cast includes most of the original play's New York cast, with one notable exception Jason Alexander steps in as the most broadly drawn of the eight characters, which makes his miscasting all the more obvious. I have often stated that it shouldn't matter if a gay man were to play a heterosexual role. If you're caught up in the story, and the actor fits the role, it works. However, the reverse it NOT always true--especially in this case. Buzz needs to be played by a gay actor, or it comes across as mockery of gay mannerisms. However well- intentioned Alexander was when he went into the film, the result is a cringe-inducing minstrel act. I have seen a live version of L!V!C!, and the actor playing Buzz nailed it, so having seen Buzz played well made it all the more obvious.That being said, the script is a good one. The story takes you back to the 1980s and a generation of men hovering around 40, and it was told from their point of view, not through heterosexual eyes. This was not common when the play premiered. So younger viewers may not appreciate how groundbreaking it was for gay male characters to speak openly and unapologetically this way. And AIDS was seen as much more of a terminal illness than it is now, with so many men you can see in a gym who could be HIV+ and still pictures of health. So take it for what it is and enjoy what still works.

It was a compassionate ensemble piece with a group of gay friends, vacationing throughout the summer at their choreographer friends' lovely lakeside home. What you catch onto quickly as well is this is not just about these friends getting together for fun times during the major summer holidays, but by the end of the summer, they are to do an AIDS-benefit performance of 'Swan Lake' that the choreographer was to stage.Within this, you'll see the workings of the human opinion in this set of friends...or in one case, so-called friend. While the backdrop is about the staging and performance of these friends doing 'Swan Lake' for the AIDS benefit performance - tutus and all - you get to see the personalities of each about the subject. Buzz, opting to hide his HIV status while faced with one who could not.The character development is good in the play, and much transfers to film - the stand out brilliance is of the English twins - played both by John Glover - portraying evil twin and lovable twin. Both who are gay, one in the final stages of AIDS who came to America for treatment and is the most endearing person you ever could meet, and the other one you just want to tie in a sack and throw into an ocean because he's so mean and callous. The character of 'Buzz' who wants to ignore his disease and pain behind singing and quoting Broadway Musicials and being the life of the party queen is a stellar performance as well.What I found interesting was the competition level between two other characters in this work. There is the choreographer who is the host - he's older and he's staging the Swan Lake performance; and a young 'buck' (Ramon) who's a dancer as well thinks he's immortal and a bronze Adonis gift to the gay male, always providing house tension and competition - not just in dance, but with the choreographer's blind partner(Bobby).As with many Terrance McNally's plays and screenplays, what'll grab you are the mind and personal feelings of the characters that's projected to the viewer and how they are adapting to the current events of the day. This film is no exception. For example, I find a wonderful exchange between the characters about a certain famous photograph that made me feel like a 'fly on the wall' as I listened - And not just that, it also touched heavily on how EVERYONE who knows about this famous photo was feeling at the time.That's the beauty of this film - you can take out homosexual men and replace them with heterosexual women, heterosexual men, homosexual women or a mix of all....and there would be very little change in the actions. But this is about a group of homosexual friends, their fears, their loves, their anguish, their humanity which is why I think the title Love! Valour! Compassion! does say it all.

Hardly.  His ambition is for himself, and to insinuate himself with Gregory.Why the conflict between Gregory and Ramon?  Because of Bobby?  That is the most simplistic of interpretations--Gregory is the Alpha male and Ramon threatens his dominance not only of his home, but his craft.  Gregory only gives the dance to Ramon after he (Gregory) has reasserted his place in the pack.Where does John's verbal violence come from?  Were he so vile as Perry makes him out to be, why then would he be invited back?

However, we allow ourselves a detachment when seeing it as a film that really doesn't mix with the story. Here's the thing for those who have a problem with either the overt homosexual themes, or the stereotypical characters...imagine if half the cast were women and the other half were heterosexual men...would you feel different about the piece if Arthur and Perry were a hetero couple?  If Ramon was a female dancer instead of a male?  The thing is, the piece is not primarily about the fact that the men are gay, or about how gay they are. It's a love story, a story of friendship, and a story of loss.  The fact that all of them are homosexual is simply a backdrop to everything else going on. Excellent performances by John Glover, Jason Alexander and Steven Bogardus.  I see what everyone is saying about not being able to get Seinfeld out of their heads, but I didn't have that problem.  The rest of the cast is only adequate, but no one lets the ensemble down.There is a trend of making filmed versions of stage performances available to the public...this would be the perfect piece with which to do that.

Valour! Compassion!  The intertwining relationships of eight gay men who retreat together to a summer house three times during the season illustrate their individual character quirks as well as their collective trials, such as the HIV virus that infects two of them.Love between various pairs in the film emerges as both an animal, lustful act that may transpire in a dark and frenzied moment, and as a more tender and fundamentally human interaction that takes years to cultivate.  Valour rears its intrepid head in the characters who deal most intimately with the virus, struggling to live gracefully even in the face of a painful and prolonged death.  Compassion repairs each man's petty differences with another, and binds these eight weary travelers together as they quietly help each other through difficult times until the end of the film.Performances in Love! Valour! Compassion! are generally well done, from John Glover's dual turn as the stiff, spiteful John and his dying and unconditionally loved twin brother James, to Jason Alexander's nuanced role as a flamboyant HIV sufferer doing his best to cope with the disease.  The often heartbreaking script is tempered by the alternately caustic and self-effacing humor inherent in a meeting of several strong gay personalities for extended periods of time. Visually, some scenes appear stagey, especially within the darkened summer house, but otherwise the play seems to have made a thematically successful and emotionally effective translation to the screen.

Eight gay men gather during three summer holiday weekends (Memorial Day, July 4th and Labor Day) at the New England country home of one of them, a successful choreographer. They bicker and banter, and fight and flirt; they bare the bodies while skinny dipping and bare their souls while trading cleverly rehearsed quips -- but, so what? As sort of a gay BIG CHILL or a homosexual FOUR SEASONS, the film really doesn't give any of them a chance to reveal themselves either politically or personally. There are a few pious monologues about love and life that are so generic as to be meaningless. If the point is to show that gays are just like everybody else, then why do all the characters seem so generically superficial and tiresomely stereotypical. If there is meant to be a message to the story, then why doesn't the film get to it? There are some nice moments here and there as two characters share an honest or intimate moment, but too often the dialogue is arch and too theatrical to be real. Other times, the material shows its theatrical roots with an out-of-nowhere dramatic moment where you can just see a character moving to center stage to deliver his big, important monologue in the spotlight. By the time you get to the end, where each character, in voice-over, reveals the circumstances of their way-in-the-distance death -- while dancing around in tutus, no less -- you just want to scream at the filmmakers. Here's a scene that totally trivialized these characters, showing them to truly be nothing but prancing fairies, yet begs you to see into the depths of their souls and weep for the fragility of their lives. The result is totally annoying, if not absolutely insulting. If it were not for the fact that many involved in the film are openly gay, you could just swear the film was trying purposely to be smugly homophobic.And you can't help but to groan at how needlessly self-important the material takes itself, even as it wallows in self-mockery.

Because of the characters, because of their problems, because of their bond to each other, because of their interest in living life THEIR way, no matter how long they have to live, and the fear of dying all alone.The characters make this movie, brilliantly pulled off from the original Broadway cast (save Jason Alexander who fills in for Nathan Lane).  The strangeness and the beauty of the characters in this film, as well as the tone of the entire piece, is that the seven men in this film are defined largely by how they love.  Not simply by stereotyped personality, but by love.  Love of their partners (if they have them, and if their partner is still alive), love of their friends, love of their lives (two of which are going to be cut short by AIDS), and love of themselves.Standing out in this ensemble of Broadway veterans is John Glover playing the VERY opposite twin brothers John and James with equal intensity and compassion, and Jason Alexander, who surprised many cynics who only knew him as George on Seinfeld.SPOILER ALERT!!!!  There is a scene in this film when all the characters give voice-over descriptions of how their lives will end.  It is very touching to think that some of these men will die alone and soon, some at home with their partner like any other old married couple, and one man is left, sadly and with great loneliness, to see the passing of the other six .. . I bury all of you.  It makes you ask yourself, what would it be like to live longer than everyone you loved?The movie, trite as it sounds, is about life.  Life as a man with an illness no one can stop and can barely control.  Life as a man angry at the world for not accepting him.  Life as a man who's past his professional and creative prime.  Life as a man who is tempted to cheat on his loved one (haven't we all been there, seriously?)  Life as a man who wants all the pleasure in life with none of the consequences.  Life as a man who wants it all to happen like a musical so that words like AIDS are written out of the song.If you watch this film to watch characters instead of events, trust me, you'll enjoy it much more.

Yet for all of that, in the end it lacked the depth - and more importantly, the tension - to pull off the story in a compelling way.The story, or perhaps more accurately, the situation is a group of eight gay men who gather on several occasions throughout the summer at the palatial of home of Gregory Mitchell (Stephen Bogardus) and his blind, and rather cloying, lover, Bobby Brahms (Justin Kirk), who live just outside of New York City. The guests include the hot-tempered, and occasionally politically incorrect, Perry Sellars (Stephen Spinella), and his long suffering lover, Arthur Pape (John Benjamin Hickey), who is occasionally embarrassed by Perry's outbursts; their campy friend Buzz Hauser (Jason Alexander), whose flamboyance hides his fears over his HIV positive status; the lugubrious John Jeckyll (John Glover), a man whose unexplained anger rules his every move; and John's companion for the first weekend Ramon Fornos (Randy Becker), a man who decides that he will have any man he wants regardless of the cost. Ramon's first conquest is Bobby which leads to tensions between Ramon, Bobby, and Gregory later in the summer. To further complicate matters, John's twin, James (again, John Glover), arrives from England midway through the summer. James, who is in somewhat more advanced stages of AIDS than Buzz, is as sweet as John is sour, which means that he fits in much better than his brother, much to John's chagrin. In addition, Buzz falls for James, which further complicates the already complicated dynamics of this group. As the summer progresses, each individual deals with his internal conflicts as well as his conflicts with the others, and at the end of the summer, they will resume their lives in the city.It's more a character study than a story, so it comes to a somewhat inconclusive ending, but along the way you do learn to care about all of the characters. Or at least you're supposed to. I never really cottoned to Ramon, and never developed much sympathy for John. Still, this movie does a good job of portraying this group as men who happen to be gay, rather than gay men. And there is a world of difference.The ensemble acting is excellent. All the performances are uniformly good. Alexander plays Buzz's flamboyance with surprising skill and tenderness. And Glover is masterful in giving the contrast between the two twins he plays. The rest of the cast does a fine job.The cinematography is gorgeous. The house and grounds are appealing, and you can almost feel the warmth of the summer as you watch.It's a very cerebral film, and for those who want more action and more story, it may seem a little dull. But it does present an excellent character study of many aspects of gay life, and as such, it is a rewarding experience.

Love and compassion are simply mentioned in the title.  The third is the disappointment you feel after watching it.The only consistent acting in the film is by Jason Alexander (Buzz). Unfortunately, even his acting seems to be only a poor interpretation of Nathan Lane's fabulous performance in The Birdcage.Eight men get together in a fabulous isolated mansion three times a year (Memorial Day, 4th of July, and Labor Day).  Some are single, some are with each other, some have HIV or AIDS, some are former lovers.  That's all we learn about them other than one is some kind of supposedly famous choreographer, one is a dancer, one has a professional job of some sort, and one of the couples own a Volvo.  Much of the film is spent watching them fight, have a little bit of fun, fight, tease each other, and take off their clothes.  It's really not much in the way of character development.The only little bit of feeling in the film is when Buzz, who is HIV+, is expressing his fears that he won't be there for his friends when they need him and that they won't be there for him when he needs them.  His newly found partner, James, is very sick with AIDS, so Buzz is concerned and emotional.  Later, we find out in narrative that James goes back to England and commits suicide.  So much for everybody being there for everybody else. So much for the one shred of feeling in the film.About the only humor in the film is the attempt at stereotypical gay camp. The little bit of fast name-dropping and teasing brings to mind really great camp movies and for a few shining moments the viewer can enjoy remembering those movies.There are better movies to watch after a nice dinner and wine.

Maybe The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was this bad. Anyway, back to THIS story. Wait, sorry, there IS no story. No plot. This is just some days in the life of people we don't care about, we never learn to care about, talking about things we don't care about and doing things not even them care about. This film is like a pathetic mix between Longtime Companion (for the AIDS theme and the one day in the life of idea) and The Boys in the Band (because... You know. 8 gay men, talking). But it takes the worst of both of these fantastic films and makes a clich√©-filled, boring, dull movie out of it. And there you really realize that it takes, indeed, a lot of talent to write (whether in a screenplay or staged play) about characters that the audience doesn't know and make them interesting without a plot. After all, in TBITB or in Longtime Companion, there isn't much plot either, but the characters are interesting in and for themselves. You want to know more about them, you are moved by them and by what happens to them. TBITB is about ONE night in the life of some people, and still by the end of the movie I felt like I knew them. L!V!C! is about half a dozen days in the life of some people, and still in the end I don't know anything about them. I don't know what unites them - they're supposedly friends but they don't get along with each other -, I don't know what drives them - but I know they drive a Volvo -, and I don't even believe them. It isn't funny or witty - though it desperately tries to be - and it's not campy - even if one of them like musicals -. It's just clich√© and and boring.

The characters are stock gay men, the kind that exist in other plays like THE BOYS IN THE BAND--only this time none of them are quite interesting enough to care about.All of them, it seems, are living under the threat of AIDS, so we have reminders of LONGTIME COMPANION here too. Most of the performances are okay--nothing really subtle here--but JASON Alexander as the campiest one who hides his anxieties with an unflappable sense of humor seems a bit out of place when it comes to the serious scenes. JUSTIN KIRK does a nice job as a blind boy whose brief fling with handsome RANDY BECKER gets him into more trouble than he can handle. BECKER is the young Hispanic dancer who flaunts his sexuality at every turn.There's some casual frontal nudity for all the skinny dipping scenes, but the sentiment gets sticky whenever the serious aspects are touched. JOHN GLOVER, as twin brothers as different as night and day, gives the most professional performance.Not likely to appeal to a wide audience, it's got some good moments but the slim plot line wears thin after the first hour.

I like to fill it up with my friends..  Sadly, I don't have any, so these are the miserable people I invited instead.'  So paraphrases the opening voice-over of the screen adaptation of Terrence McNally's off-Broadway play.  Better it had remained off-Broadway.LVC is a clear nod to Mart Crowley's 1968 off-Broadway `Boys in the Band,' likewise brought to the big screen in 1970.  Like its predecessor, LVC is premised on a gathering of eight disparate and self-loathing NYC gay men with seemingly no emotional bond between them.  Apparently the cultural stereotypes of the 1960's still live on in the 90's, as the updated group includes a choreographer prone to passive aggressive hissy fits, a bitchy theater queen, an air-headed pretty boy dancer, and a tiresome yuppie (yes, he DOES tie pastel sweaters around his neck).  Similarly, both films include most of their original theater casts.  Even BITB's scene of the partygoers line dancing to Martha Reeves and the Vandella's `Heatwave' is reprised in an oddly placed performance of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies from `Nutcracker Suite.'  So with all this in common, what makes BITB a classic of gay cinema and LVC so laughably forgettable?BITB, as repeated in so many gay retrospectives, hit the stage before the watershed Stonewall Riot of 1969.  It was a whisper before gay identity truly found its voice.  There is something compellingly sympathetic about this collection of men who hang together simply because they can be their uncloseted selves around each other.  Their bitchiness and self-loathing too must be viewed in the context of their repressive era.  This desperate need for camaraderie and acceptance, however, doesn't translate well to LVC and the 1990's.Or maybe it's the film direction that sets them apart.  William Friedkin, who directed BITB, is no stranger to the screen nor to controversy.  His credits include `The Exorcist,' `French Connection,' `Cruising,' and `To Live and Die in LA.'  Joe Mantello, by contrast played a couple bit parts in `Law and Order' in addition to directing LVC.  And LVC is hardly a groundbreaking movie.Or maybe it's the actors.  The miscast Jason Alexander (Nathan Lane wisely declined the chance to repeat his stage role) leaves the audience expecting George Castanza's parents and Kramer to barge in at any time.  And I would rather have the skin peeled off my still living body than see Jason Alexander in a tutu again.It's very likely that LVC stages much better than it screens.  McNally, after all, wrote `The Ritz,' `Kiss of the Spider Woman,' `Ragtime,' and `Frankie and Johnny,' to deserved critical acclaim.   Indeed, the forced dialect (including the sappy final voice-over) is far more appropriate to theater than to cinema.

It's not a movie about homosexuality so much as humanity, and there is a certain provocative ease the characters display with each other that comes from a mutual sense of vulnerability and the need to have someone to trust. Visually, the film is both careful and challenging.  These men are all afraid of what they don't know, braced against the imminent, and yet essentially collected.  I found myself identifying with each of them through strengths and shortcomings that were not easily detectable from the first. The relationship nuances hint at so many more layers than this short vacation together can define.  I found myself feeling that I had had these same conversations in my life, that I was just as fearful, defiant, exuberant, resigned.  The highlight of the film, to me, came in dual performances by John Glover, who handled his roles with a supple elegance that left a poignant vision in my mind of two brothers, light and dark, resolutely at odds and entangled at the same time.  Overall, I found the watching enjoyable and liberating.  It was pleasant to actually feel like a fly on the wall in a place no female could ever really find herself (hetero or otherwise).  This film WILL put demands on you in areas of personal perspective.  If you feel for these men, then you must understand them. Getting there might be hard for some people.

I don't care if this was based on a play or not, it still reeks of stereotypes, cramming them down your throat until you gag. I jokingly said there would the AIDS sufferer here. There was. There's the pretty boy. Yup. The camp one - check. The. I could go on but it's painful. I've never met anyone like these people - do they even exist? There's an attempt to flesh them out, by having them being ponderous and argumentative but it doesn't work. The actors are familiar faces from the TV, which prompted wry smiles from me when you see John Glover in a dress, after playing the almost-devil incarnate Lionel Luthor in `Smallville' and the actual devil incarnate in `Brimstone'. And that's George from `Seinfeld', not anyone else. It's a slight on the actors that they can't convincingly make me believe in their other roles. The pretty-boy, for example (whose name escapes me) seems to act only in the sense his body is without clothes for most of the picture. That's all well and good in some respects, but it doesn't engage the mind as such.So we've got weak acting and thin characters. Can the plot help it? Course not, this is a character piece that's entirely reliant on the characters. The characters have no depth so we can't care about them. Their lives, as they progress, mean little to me. Sure huge swathes of character development were cut to fit into a movie length. but it's at the expense of me giving a whit. It all builds up to a cloying (and vaguely insulting) ending, with the typical voice-over about the future. There doesn't seem to be a bit of originality here and the window we view on their lives is dull enough that it's presumably set in a plain white-square frame.`Love! Valour!

He deserves success.The rest of the performances are contrived, unbelievable, stereotypical, overplayed, shallow, emotionally erratic, painful (not in a good way) ... and Jason Alexander is positively frightening! ... and then come the twins !! Yowza ! The only allowance is I can make for this is the year it was made, 1997 - the world was much different then. And, attitudes toward 'gay' and 'AIDS' were much more fearful.However, these people just don't make sense,... but the setting is nice!I can't recommend this movie to anyone. If you have any awareness of the real world, it will offend sensibility. If you are looking for role models to come out as, don't watch this ... it's complete misinformation and should not be taken seriously.

The performances range from adequate to magnificent (John Glover, in the dual role of James and John Jeckyll, definitely inhabits the high end of that spectrum).  The confrontation between the Jeckyll brothers, which works well enough on stage, is much more effective here.One sour note  I could have lived without seeing Jason Alexander's bare butt, and I could have lived without seeing him in this film.  If Nathan Lane wasn't available or didn't want to do it, couldn't they have gotten Mario Cantone, who replaced Lane on stage?

I couldn't help but thinking about Seinfeld while watching this film. I found myself laughing at innapropriate times and ruining the film. There were some emotional moments that are worth accolades but...George? Gay? Sadly it is because of this predisposition that I cannot rate this movie. So if anyone was or is a regular Sienfeld viewer please be warned!

Except on film. That was sacred ground where no sexual deviates dared rear their nasty head. And if they did, it was as the fall guy, the pervert, the weirdo with a lisp, the psycho-killer who had a thing for dresses. So when the zeitgeist of the 90s decided it was time to give the gays stories of their own, no one, it seemed, knew how to approach the material. It was all so risky, like walking on eggshells.It's so evident here as to cry for help. Setting myself aside from the praise pretty much everyone and their mother have given Terrence McNally for coming up with this un-fabulous story, I don't buy it. I don't get it. I don't even believe in it -- that's how strongly I feel against this movie that somehow became a hit if a dated hit. It reeks of fabricated fake. I can't identify with a story that whacks me on the top of my head like an angry stick trying to troll for prizes as it tries to let me in on the miles of angst these people spew out. Especially when it revolves on clich√©s and a predictable setup involving two of the most stereotypical characters ever to grace a story the Latino sex-bomb and the fey disabled man, so sweet you want to club him.Sure, the times gave it its importance, the people who saw it -- gay men among them -- were more than validated, and everyone was happy. I for one, was not. Not partaking in self-pitying, self-loathing, womanly emotions gone to hell, and the need for excessive, over the top drama, I saw it for what it was -- a dated story closer to the spirit of the 80s, i. e. LONGTIME COMPANION -- and moved on to the next flick. And hoped never to fall for manipulative melodramas such as this hypocritical, soulless, un-recommendable movie. "}]
