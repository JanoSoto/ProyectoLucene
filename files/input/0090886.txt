Diane Keaton plays Lennie, the eldest sister, who's feelings of awkwardness prevent her from being happy.  Jessica Lange is Meg, the fast-moving middle sister who packed up and left town for the big lights of Hollywood, only to be disappointed.  And Sissy Spacek is Babe, the kooky youngest sister, recently charged with shooting her husband.The sisters are tormented by their cousin and neighbor, Chick, played by Tess Harper.  Her own desire to be an upstanding member of the ladies league, combined with her desire to outshine and belittle her cousins, make her the villain in this story.The sisters are reunited when Babe shoots her husband.  As she says, she 'didn't like his stinkin' looks.'  Babe is slightly unbalanced.  After shooting him in the stomach she went out and made herself a pitcher of lemonade.  What was most bizarre was that she then had the nerve to offer him a glass!Over the course of several days the sisters confront the demons that have been troubling them.  Lennie has 'shrunken ovaries' and therefore cannot have children.  She believes that this is keeping her from getting a man. Meg is tortured by her own selfishness.  The rumors about her convincing Doc Porter (played by Sam Sheppard) to hang around in during a hurricane, only to suffer a life altering leg injury, are all true.The film reads like the play from which is came from.  The scenes are often long.  The dialogue marches on from subject to subject.  The characters are well fleshed out, however most of the information we get comes from suggestions and flashbacks made by the characters.  One must listen to the dialogue in this film in order to truly follow the story.The acting is first rate by all four leads.  Sissy Spacek and Tess Harper are definate standouts.  They each received nominations at the Oscars that year.  Lange and Keaton play their parts well.  The cast works as an ensemble, with no upstaging, but rather opportunities for everyone to shine.Crimes of the Heart is a first rate piece that may not be appropriate for all movie goers, simply because it requires the viewer to pay attention to detail.  The action is slow moving, making room for some wonderful dialogue. Enjoy this film as it offers some great acting with a pretty decent script.

If Jessica Lange, Diane Keaton and Sissy Spacek weren't absolutely delighted to tackle the lead roles in this film, they are much better actors than I thought.The material is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor, who wrote some of the most humorous, offbeat Southern fiction extant.The three sisters are so controlled by their visceral reactions that one wonders if any of them have ever had an intellectual moment. Although it would be maddening to have such people for friends, they're great instruments for movie comedy.One final note If anyone thinks Sissy Spacek is goofy-looking (as I used to), they will change their mind when they see her in this.

The film tries to bring in a nostalgic sense too though, and does not quite succeed, and the drama of the material does not mix well with the comedy. The choices of music are not too good either, and Tess Harper comes across as very annoying in an over-the-top way, but the virtues of the film are better than its shortcomings. The film comes across as rather lightweight with its black comedy treatment, but it certainly raises some issues with families and coping with one's past, among other ideas. It is not however a film to watch for its messages, but one to simply enjoy for its amusing parts and cinematic virtues, which include some good sound recording too.

The three sisters, each unique in their own quirky way, adore each other as they resent each other. But the beauty is their coming together in those family moments when nothing is as good as kin.So much sunshine lights on the faces and expressions of the actresses, and the tension, though slow, makes for a more interesting look into the inner life of Lenny, Babe and Meg. The supporting case all did fine jobs, and although short lived, the interaction between Lange & Shepard magnified their personal connection.Harper, the harpy, uppity cousin, was as typical as a cousin could get in a small town with know-it-all manners and nothing much to offer but spite. She played it for all it was worth, and then some, and get a head's up from the Academy.Babe's character played by Sissy Spacek, was perhaps the central figure in the triumvirate, but Keaton and Lange held their own throughout.A most worthy southern tale to laugh at, cry with and relate to with ease.

Directed here by Bruce Beresford, this is quintessential Henley -- her first work to be produced professionally -- offering the story of the three quirky, maladjusted Magrath sisters, who reunite following family misfortune to reflect on their unstable past, present and futures.Lenny, the eldest sister, is the repressed 'plain Jane' self-imposed into early spinsterhood because of her barren condition.  Considering herself damaged goods, she now conducts her life as such, tending to her garden and other non-romantic pursuits.  Meg, in the middle, is the listless live wire, the capricious, hard-living beauty who fled the coop early to pursue an aimless career  in Hollywood as a singer.  The prodigal daughter finally returns, rather reluctantly, when serious trouble brews back home.  Babe, the youngest and most susceptible to eccentric behavior, seems to take after their dead, self-destructive mother (a suicide) as she battles with manic depression and resorts to off-the-wall bits of craziness.  In jail at the present for critically shooting her husband (she didn't like his looks), her bizarre action prompts this filial reunion.  As served up by a triune of powerhouse, Oscar-winning ladies, the star performances should have really cooked.  Instead they seems unoriginal and pat.  Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange are overtly mannered as the two older sisters Lenny and Meg.  Keaton especially, easily the Sandy Dennis of the 70s and 80s, has her neurotic fireworks on full display.  The snorting laughter, the flailing gestures, the quizzical eye-rolling, the stammering speeches.  What seemed delightfully offbeat in Woody Allen comedies has become old hat and irksome as the years roll on.  Lange, too, has her patented affectations on all four burners.  The far-away gaze, the slow, reflective speech patterns, the whimsical, lackadaisical laugh and edgy stance.  Both of the actresses have represented themselves much better in other vehicles.  Ironically, Sissy Spacek, whose character lends itself to be the most neurotic of the three, comes off more inspired and assured -- a complete departure, by the way, from her typical Coal Miner's Daughter money-maker.  Good for her.In support, rangy actor/writer Sam Shepard, Lange's long-time off-camera squeeze, has little to do here but look longingly as Lange's on-camera squeeze.  But Tess Harper goes way overboard as the overly-opiniated Chick, the snippy, mullet-haired cousin and next-door neighbor, who stereotypes the vicious down-home chatterbox to the nth degree.  While her villainy (which kept jogging my memory of wonderful Madeleine Sherwood's Sister Woman portrayal in Cat On a Hot Tin Roof) certainly enlivens the action as chief foil to the sisters, they tear down the walls of believability as well.Despite some well-acted moments from this unarguably talented cast, the overbaked production cannot overcome its stagy origins, striving much too much to push the black comedy element down the viewer's throat.  One wacky scene has Diane Keaton chasing Tess Harper out of her house and around the backyard with a broom, a bit that comes off just plain ridiculous even though it's meant to be a catalyst for liberating Keaton's Lenny character.  I'm sorry, but broom-chasing went out with Marjorie Main's Ma Kettle character years ago.  This and other eccentric scenes simply come off forced, as if the actors are playing the intention instead of the moment.  Lange and Shepard's giddy dancing drunk scene, Spacek's over-sugared lemonade bit, and even Keaton's impromptu birthday cake segment are guilty of this felonious acting charge.While definitely Tennessee Williams-influenced, the rather thin Henley story and characters pale in comparison.  Working much better on stage, this movie remains, however, a curiosity item that somehow ended up on simmer instead of boil, despite the obvious potential.

The talents of the three famous actresses were wasted on this depressing bit of drivel. I prefer comedies of the heartwarming, romantic, light hearted, or zany school.The story revolves around three troubled sisters in a Southern town, who reunite when the youngest, Babe (rather a bizarre character), gets herself in a jam after shooting her husband. The oldest sister, Lenny, is an awkward spinster who has stayed home throughout the years caring for her father. The alcoholic, chain smoking middle sister, Meg, left home early in the hopes of making it as a singer & actress in Hollywood. There's also a jealous & snoopy cousin, Chick, who's basically the villain of the piece.It has a stellar cast, especially its three leading ladies in the roles of the neurotic sisters, who are all coping in their individual ways following the trauma of their mother's suicide by hanging. Diane Keaton plays the shy, insecure, stammering spinsterish Lenny, who feels herself inadequate to attract a man because of her inability to bear children (due to shrunken ovaries). Jessica Lange is cast as the wild sister, Meg, who hates her father and has had a string of failed relationships with men...including a current love interest, Doc Porter (played by Sam Shepherd). Sissy Spacek is the kooky younger sister, Babe, who married at a young age an abusive man. Presumably well crafted with great performances, but the tale of the personal demons troubling the three eccentric sisters simply doesn't make for humour, as I see it. When Babe shoots her husband, then goes into the kitchen to make a pitcher of lemonade, and offers him a glass...well, it's not something I find hilarious or entertaining to watch. It's set in the South, and for me the best part of the film is the wonderful old Victorian family home where the sisters reunite. Otherwise, I'll stick to the Steel Magnolias type when I feel like a movie interweaving the tales of a group of women.

Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange star as three Southern sisters who reunite when one (Spacek) shoots her husband. The sisters are, of course, incredibly different and their personalities collide over the course of a few days, dealing with what Spacek's character has done while old feuds come to the surface. Clearly based on a play, most of the action takes place in the same house and the film puts everything on the shoulders of the three central women.Keaton plays Lenny, the matriarch of the trio (both of their parents are deceased and their grandfather who raised them is in the hospital) who is socially inept and often gets stepped on by her siblings. Lange is Meg, the popular and outgoing wild girl, man-eater and failed actress. Spacek rounds it out as the potentially insane and murderous Babe. Tess Harper steals her few scenes as Chick Boyle, who lives next door to the house, but the whole thing is centered around the three sisters and that's what makes it work. The film never takes itself too seriously, despite it's morbid themes and narrative, and the women all do a marvelous job of bringing the laughs mostly without overdoing it.Crimes of the Heart is a film that on paper doesn't appeal to my tastes at all, but I often found myself cracking up at the ridiculousness of these characters. The women play the characters as straight as possible, approaching them as characters rather than jokes, and this helps make it an enjoyable experience as opposed to a grating one, although Keaton does overdo it at times. The characters are erratic and very large, which opens itself up to potential disaster, but in selecting the proper actresses for each role they were able to make it an entertaining little movie. It's a simple, light and enjoyable film; certainly nothing memorable and I'm sure I won't be thinking about it at all in a few days, but a nice experience while it lasts.

The movie is set in the South and the southern accent is there, especially when they say Babe, Babe! This is a brilliant script nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium by Pulitzer Prizewinning play,  Beth Henley.  The movie is mostly filmed in a house. I love that concept because it inspires writers and emerging film makers that one does not need a fortune to make a great movie. Especially if you are a woman. We like to talk, do our nails and hair.  That is female bonding.  This movie is raises very important issues (1) mental health, because there is a history of depression in the family.  Their mother committed suicide by hanging herself with the old yellow cat.  Babe is trying to do the same thing. She has the most hysterical approaches. Then she kept talking about her mother as a transference of her own feelings of depression. (2) Racism, a white woman from the South having an affair with a black young man under age; (3) Physical abuse, Babe was abused by her husband. That is why she shot him. (4) Meg is aging and the sisters kept talking about whether Meg was still a virgin. (5) the aging grandfather, etc.  This a gem of a movie! I have the tape and watch from time to time.

Three sisters are reunited in their home town due to one of them being accused of shooting her husband. A fairly conventional plot device - an event brings an estranged family together, skeletons are revealed, wounds reopened, yadda yadda yadda, they reconcile. However, here there is nothing intriguing at all about their relationship. There's no axes to grind, no skeletons in the closet, nothing to reconcile. So instead of human drama, we just have a rambling, pointless story. Lack of a intriguing plot needn't be the end of it, the movie could be character-driven. Sadly, Crimes of the Heart fails in that regard too. One of the sisters (played by Jessica Lange) is selfish and unthinking, one (Sissy Spacek) is, well, nuts, and the other (Diane Keaton) is plain dull (and her saying babe all the time starts to grind very quickly).So there is very little engagement with the characters.Director Bruce Beresford tries to replace plot and character depth with quirkiness, but this just makes the movie irritating.A decent cast undermined by a dull plot and listless direction.

The whole thing left me thinking, maybe Steel Magnolias wasn't so bad after all! *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Well acted, poorly directed","Date":"28 April 2001","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  It's quite a feat to take a really good play, give it a great cast, and still manage to make a bad movie. I've liked many of Bruce Beresford's movies, but this one just didn't work. He doesn't have any sense of comic timing, so a lot of the humor falls flat. And it's a real shame because the actresses are all wonderful. They play off of each other really well, and they really feel like sisters. It's worth seeing just for the acting.

I believe the issue here is pedophilia. If this had been presented as a man of Sissy Spacek's characters age and a 15 year old girl, everyone would be calling this child molesting, pedophilia, crime of the heart? No this crime is what it is, child molestation and they move tried to present it as a tender touching moment between a lonely older woman and a younger man, he was a child. Enough said, besides that issue this movie did not do much for me, depressing and lacked a point for me. Not one of Jessica Lange's better films.

Personally, I really enjoyed the story line of this movie. Kinda like Steele Magnolias, Bigger, Rosewood, The Color Purple (just name a few) combined all into a certain type of setting. It just went to show the ignorance of our pasts. Each actress played an excellent role, and whoever chose them did a wonderful job of doing so. Got MY thumbs up!! ================================================================ (me) Now that was a great review. Then for some reason it went off on a weird tangent. For instance, she says To those of you who rated it low, SHAME ON YOU! Why exactly is it her job to change people's opinions? ========================================================== (mrsjcc0312)To those of you who rated it low, SHAME ON YOU! Too Bad this measly little housewife can give a better review that you can. TRADE ME jobs! You can come here to my house and make sure the kids are taken care of, the military husband is cared for and the bills are paid, and I'LL go to sit and watch movies and get paid for it. Even Siskel and Ebert sucked at what they did!! Why do we even listen to you? ========================================================== (me)Then suddenly she went off on a different tangent again. Talking about her home life. Maybe she was drunk. Maybe she is angry with her husband. Maybe she should get off the computer and take care of her family and her husband is a control freak and she doesn't keep the house clean like he likes it and she burns the mac and cheese and everyone is angry and she has no one to blame. I am not sure what mrsjcc0312 does in her life, but I just wanted to read the comments about this movie. I have never read any of these and was curious. Odd the first one I read happens to be hers. Good luck in your life mrsjcc0312, I hope you get your life together. I liked Siskel and Ebert btw. ================================================================ "}]
