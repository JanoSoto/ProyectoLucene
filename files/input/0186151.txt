The idea is based on the main character being able to communicate with his father, who's been dead for 30 years. His father hears it then, 30 years earlier. They quickly do some things that shouldn't have happened back then, which then changes the future(or present). The movie deals very well with how they change the future back and forth. The plot is very good, the acting is superb and the characters are all believable. The special effects are very good. The very idea behind the film is very good, but the way it develops so much further is amazing. The ending, while it may seem corny too some, and is, by all means, a bit of a typical Hollywood ending(some might even call it a cop-out), but personally I just think it worked better than anything else could have.

Back to the Future, Timecop, and The Final Countdown come immediately to mind.  Director Gregory Hoblit (his Fallen (1998)and Primal Fear (1996) were both excellent) explores that theme again in Frequency.  But writer Toby Emmerich (in his first writing credit), puts a different spin on the theme.  In most 'changing the past' films, a character goes back in time.  In Frequency, one main character lives in 1999 while another lives in 1969--and you see the actions in 1969 immediately affecting 1999.  Sounds confusing, huh?  Well, it is.  But it works.The movie opens with the introduction of the Sullivan family.  Frank (Dennis Quaid) is a heroic New York firefighter, and escapes a harrowing situation to return home to his wife and his 6-year-old son John.  It's an exciting time in New York, as the 'Miracle Mets' have made the World Series.  Frank is a ham radio user, and a strange disturbance in the sky (solar flares, I believe.  I never took astronomy) in the sky has really increased the range of his radio.  I'm reaching people I've never reached before, he says. Flash forward to 1999, when young John has grown up into a 36-year-old NY homicide detective (James Caviezel) with relational problems (and possibly a drinking problem as well).  We learn his father died several years earlier in a warehouse fire, and it's obvious that John has never really gotten over it.  He ends up setting up the old ham radio (did I mention that the solar flares are back?), and contacts a fellow New Yorker named Frank.  It certainly won't ruin any big surprise when I tell you that it's his father Frank--in 1969.  After recovering from his astonishment and convincing his father who he really is (his knowledge of the 1969 World Series proves quite helpful), they begin a series of nightly conversations.  Unfortunately, their conversations change the past--and the future--in very dangerous ways. A serial killer who should only have 3 victims suddenly has more, and John must use his knowledge of the crimes (30 years old to him) to guide his dad in a 1969 pursuit of the killer.  And the chase is on.  Will they stop the killer?  Will the solar flares last long enough for them to finish their plan?  Will anyone in 1999 or 1969 believe them?That lengthy 'plot summary' really didn't ruin any of the suspense--or come close to explaining the whole story.  So, it goes without saying that the story is pretty convoluted and involved.  But it's not hard to follow, and the movie grabbed me and kept me interested throughout.  Granted, you will need to use a serious amount of 'suspension of disbelief'.  If you get hung up on there's no way they could be talking to each other or changes in the past wouldn't immediately appear in the future--they would have already happened and would have been there all along, you'll do 2 things (1) you'll give yourself a headache, and (2) you'll miss out on a very entertaining film.  The reason I gave this more stars than last week's U-571?  I cared about the characters, and I found Frequency much more entertaining.  Also, the story was quite original--with great use of the Miracle Mets and the 1969 World Series throughout.Speaking of the characters--Quaid and Caviezel both do great work.  Their conversations via radio are very touching and authentic (once you accept the general premise, of course).  Although Quaid is a 'movie star', don't let that fool you--he's a very good (and probably underrated) actor.  Just watch him as Doc Holliday in Wyatt Earp (1994), Remy McSwain in The Big Easy (1987), or Gordo Cooper in The Right Stuff (1983) if you don't believe me. And Caviezel's a real up-and-comer (1998's The Thin Red Line).  He does a great job as a grieving son who is reunited (in a way) with his father, but watches his joy dissipate in the face of the mess he's created.  He also believably portrays a character who has memories of the way things were, but is now bombarded with 'new' memories of the way things have become.  The other characters are definitely secondary, but Elizabeth Mitchell as wife/mom Julia, and Andre Braugher (TV's Homicide, 1998's City of Angels, and 1989's Glory) as Frank's policeman friend Satch are both solid.This film has some decent action/suspense scenes, and 1999 John's radio conversation with his buddy Gordo (in 1969) is very funny.  There have certainly been better action/suspense/serial killer movies (the action scenes weren't amazing, the story has some holes, and I thought the ending was a little cheesy), but the heart of the film is the relationship between Frank and John.  I bought into that relationship fully, and that's why I liked this film as much as I did.  And that's why I definitely recommend seeing Frequency. "},{"Title":"Wow!

Jim Caviezel (The Thin Red Line) plays his son, now a cop, thirty years later. Through some quirk of physics involving abnormal solar activity and the Aurora Borealis, the two make contact with each other across the 30-year span over a ham radio. The son is able to prevent his father's death, but changing the past also turns out to have unexpected consequences with which the two must deal.The film really works on all levels with good action sequences and suspense, a nice dose of humor and some very touching exchanges between father and son. It explores the what if scenario of one's being presented with the opportunity to change an event in the past and the way in which those affected must deal with the consequences in a very intelligent and thought-provoking manner.The acting is uniformly strong, with Quaid very appealing as the courageous firefighter and loving father who has an almost-childlike love for baseball (he even pulls off a Brooklyn accent nicely!); Caviezel is equally good as the present day version of Quaid's character's son. Caviezel brings a subtle sadness to the character, a quality one might expect from someone whose life hasn't quite worked out quite as well as it might have, possibly due to a void created by the absence of his father. One of the strongest aspects of Caviezel's performance was a subtle shift in personality following the changing of events in the past (a change which left him with memories both of his father's death and of time spent with his father in the intervening years).I have a good feeling about this film and think it has a chance to be a real surprise hit. It's certainly one of the best films of the year thus far.

Jim Caviezel stars as John Sullivan, a detective whose life is falling apart. Recently, he has split up from his girlfriend, he and his police partner Satch (Andre Braugher), are unable to solve a serial murder case that has been reopened due to the discovery of skeletal remains of a past victim. The thirty year anniversary of the death of his firefighter father (Dennis Quaid), is also approaching. John is beginning to sink in a pit of despair.One night John stumbles upon his dad's old ham radio. He makes an effort to get the machine to power up once again. When he does and begins conversations with another operator, however, he realizes the person he is communicating with is his long dead father. Somehow, due to the presence of the Northern Lights, John is able to transmit back in time to 1969 and literally alter the course of his existence. The concept of time traveling communication may seem far-fetched  to some, and Frequency is a little hard to grasp at times, especially when the film never directly explains why the father and son are able to talk with each other through time. Notwithstanding, the production works as a science fiction thriller with supernatural overtones. While the filmmakers do succeed in convincingly constructing Frequency, most audiences might have to leave logic at the theater entrance before viewing it.Frequency is a well-structured motion picture; the movie is focused throughout. Although its story changes pace at different periods,  for the most part the audience can follow along with the characters. This is a movie with a complicated and challenging story. Because of the film's complexity, we are enormously involved, if slightly confused. Screenwriter Tobias Emmerich links original and fresh feeling material here. Gregory Hoblit produces the right amount of action and suspense, combined with gentle emotions, to generate a film we have not seen before. Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are the perfect choices for the principal characters. Quaid performs with intriguing tension and appropriate receptivity. Caviezel dazzles with intricacy and dexterity. Offering refined supporting roles are Andre Braugher (City of Angels, Get on the Bus) and Noah Emmerich (The Truman Show) who furnishes some light-hearted material as John's best friend. Director Gregory Hoblit (Fallen, Primal Fear) clearly executes topics on screen. This film is overflowing with ideas and contains enough plot for a television series. However, Frequency is not without flaws. Sullivan's chaotic life is only vaguely portrayed. Although we do care for the character, more development would increase the relationship between the audience and he.  Some of the make-up effects depicting age differences were disgraceful. Andre Braugher appeared as if his make up artists were straight out of junior high, slapping too much pancake cream plaster on him. The film's contrived climax concludes with a formalistic fight instead of continuing its battle of wits. Despite a few unacceptable external problems, internally this is a very effective production. As a whole, Frequency contains a very encompassing story and places interesting characters in engaging circumstances. The movie is definitely worthy of recognition, but do not view it unless you plan on thoroughly discussing it afterwards.

Once they establish who they are, they have little time for small talk since lives are about to be altered as they seek to influence the past. Not only that, but a serial killer known for what became known as the Nightingale Murders is now back on the scene. What have they done? What can they do? And more importantly now, who will get hurt? I personally have been delighted to find on line reviewers of this film to have been as pleasantly surprised as I was. Many have focused on the fact that they didn't know what to expect, and thus got rewarded for being in the dark as it were. So with that in mind, I'm not about to start delving into the film too much, because if you are a potential first time viewer then you really are better off going in with no expectation level. What can safely be said is that Frequency achieves a rare feat of successfully blending genres and thematics. Sci-fi, mystery, fantasy, thriller, crime and drama all come into play in unknown director Gregory Hoblit's film. Nicely written by Toby Emmerich, the film also benefits from its fine cast of actors. Leading man is Dennis Quaid, who might just be one of the most safest go to guys in his generation, and support comes from a pre-Jesus James Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Shawn Doyle and Elizabeth Mitchell.Frequency is heartily recommended to those who don't need head twisting cinema before they can proclaim a film to be worthy of their time. Yes some things of course defy logic here, this is after all a fantasy led film.

This one doesn't have classic time-travel, but it's similar in that there is the ability for father (in 1969) and son (present-day) to communicate and effect change in the future. It's a strong story with twists and turns as the son tries to save his father's life (in 1969) and accidentally messes up things in the present day.When I first rented the movie, I had never seen the trailer. I am very glad, because the trailer gives away a big plot twist, which occurs halfway into the movie and I think it is more exciting if you don't see that coming (so I won't elaborate on that part).This movie has authentic characters that I really cared about, which makes the suspense so much more real because I felt invested in what was going to happen to them. The strong directing and cinematography (atmospheric) ties this story together into the perfect package.I also loved the small hints and moments that are sprinkled throughout the film that tie back into the larger time travel-ish story, which makes it great on repeat viewings. I thought the moments of how the past affected the future were all plausible except for one moment toward the very end of the film, which was clearly done for dramatic effect, (so I'll let it go).Overall, one of my favorite movies!

Now, when I initially examined this film for what it was - a movie with a respectable premise, but directed by a guy I had never heard of, and starring a group of actors who aren't really well-known - I was rather apprehensive about watching it. Though, after actually watching Frequency I can say that my expectations were pretty much demolished. What threw me for a loop was the direction that this movie took. All I expected Frequency to be was a long, drawn out reunion between a father and his grief-stricken son (which sounded to good to me. . .but didn't really sound spectacular). But, about a third of the way in, Frequency turned into a very intense crime thriller. That being said, the film excels at interweaving thrills and poignancy without making the transitions feel jarring. The acting was very well executed I'd say, for you learn to feel for both Frank and John Sullivan as Frequency's intriguing plot thickens. The script was pretty well-written too. Overall, I'd say that Frequency was an entertaining sci-fi flick that offered a variety of gratifying elements within it.

Caviezel and Quaid are great actors and they sell it well, even in their talk of of the 1969 Mets.

I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters.  I saw it twice on cable, and now that I bought the DVD, I watched it again.  I was just as intrigued as when I watched it the first time!  Needless to say, the premise is extremely original.  I seem to always connect well with films involving father/son relationships, since I don't have an ideal relationship with my father.  So it was really sweet to watch a film about a guy communicating with his deceased father, and watching them bond and chat about the All-American game.  Not only is it a touching drama, but it's also an exciting thriller.  Director Gregory Hoblit and writer Toby Emmerich couldn't have done much to make the film better. Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel both deliver great, spirited performances.  I always notice more and more flaws in Quaid's New York accent in repeat viewings, but his acting is terrific nonetheless.  Andre Braugher gives another strong performance as Satch.  And the actor who plays the villain is quite creepy.  I would expect that after seeing the movie a couple times, the ending would no longer make me cry, but the ending STILL chokes me up!  As a matter of fact, I'm about to cry just thinking about it.

Such statements caused me and a whole lot of others to avoid this stellar film at all costs. After the disappointment I faced when seeing The Sixth Sense, I was pleased to see someone get the ghost-horror genre right with Stir of Echoes, and after the blunder of What Lies Beneath, I had just about had it with ghosts.But this is not a ghost story. It's more of a science fiction movie, and a very original and intelligent one at that. It starts off poorly, leaving the viewer to expect some kind of mindless fireman action film, dropping you head-on into franticism that follows characters that you know nothing about and, therefore, could care less for.Thankfully, the characters in this film soon become the focus, and the action takes a major step back in order to allow the characters to bounce one another and, in a span of less than ten minutes, this film transforms from a third rate action flick into a marvelous display of emotion and intellect.The plot is hardly believable, revolving around the aurora borealis and an old radio that allows Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) to communicate with his son exactly thirty years in the future, long after Frank's untimely demise. The explanation for how and why is delivered through news flashes on the television, explaining that the aurora borealis cannot be fully realized because it completely defies all the laws of physics, making an intelligent and interesting case for the believability of the plot. But how believable the plot is is not important by any means, as the characters are so stellar that you will be simply on the edge of your seat waiting for certain characters to interact with one another. The dialogue in this film is VERY believable, and at times it is both beautifully touching and horrifyingly intense.The given science of changing the future is a little bit muddled throughout (especially toward the end) but the characters' individual evolutions are incredibly real. For instance, in 1969 John's mother is a beautiful and free-spirited nurse, where in 1999 she has aged so realistically and yet retains her core characteristics as a loving mother and an overworked nurse. The physical differences are real as can be, right down to their voices.I should also mention that the villain in this film is one of the most despicable characters in fictional history. I usually find the sympathetic and tortured villains that act out of desperation to be the most memorable--however, the villain in this story is relentless, soulless, and terrifying--not to mention REAL. He shadows the heroes in both time frames with an unparalleled intellect, cold and calculating brilliance, as well as a sadistic personal life that extends beyond the Sullivan family. His character provides the backbone of this story, making it quite possibly the most intense and suspenseful movie in history.Lastly, the directing seems a little mindless at the start, but as the film progresses the director takes a major turn, making the film more dreamlike and artful. The simultaneity is portrayed flawlessly between the two timelines, and at times the images displayed in this film are quite magnificent.Never has a film glued me to my chair in the manner that this film did. Joy, love, hate, sadness, and fear will run deep throughout every bone in your body--this film is able to bring out all of your emotions at once. While being a film designed mostly just for entertainment and escapism, it's quite possibly the best of its kind--if not, it's certainly better than The Sixth Sense.

These holes were glaringly obvious. But if I disregard these things and just look at how well the film entertained me, it is definitely one of the better time travel films out there.Dennis Quaid is the father, Jesus is the son. Perhaps that makes Quaid God, but I think that might be a stretch. He is Joseph at best. Initially, the goal is to save the father from dying in a fire... but once that goal is accomplished, why not do more? Save more lives, maybe read off some winning lottery numbers. The plot shifts drastically about a third of the way in, but then gets actually better.The best parts of this movie are the father tracking down a killer, trying to stop him before he kills nurses (thus gaining himself the nickname the Nightingale Killer). Using facts from the crime after the fact, he is easily able to know where and when the killer will strike. The film then becomes an interesting detective story as well as a heart-warming family tale. (Some of the family stuff is a bit hard to believe... way too much love going on here.)Look close (not too close) and you will see a young Michael Cera as Gordo Junior. This is three years before Cera broke out with Arrested Development (and went on to much bigger things from there), though he had done previous acting roles by this point in things you probably never saw.Of course this film is recommended. If you are too much of a stick-in-the-butt and you can only focus on the flaws, you will be frustrated with this film. But, come on! Sometimes fantasy is just fantasy.

He finds out that not only does the radio work,but that he can communicate with his father Frank(Dennis Quaid,here excellent), a NYC fireman who's been dead for over thirty years. NAturally skeptical at first,when Sullivan discovers that he can communicate through time to his dad,he figures a way to save his father from the way he dies(which happens to be on the job,rescuing someone from a burning building). The joy of bringing back his dad from an unfortunate fate unleashes another terrible fate,this time to his loving mother(a warmly beautiful and sympathetic Elizabeth Mitchell),and now Sullivan has to again team with his dad,through space and time,to correct that outcome as well.A stirring supporting performance by Andre Braugher(one of my faves from TV's HOmicide)as a longtime family friend of the Sullivans,mixed with a deft script and alert,capable direction by Gregory Hoblitt,is able to make this film into something a little more than a sci-fi/fantasy tale OR a murder/thriller suspense caper.

Frequency's vehicle is that the 2 manage to communicate through time, the father being in 1969 and the son in 1999. The idea put forth to explain this rather implausible phenomenon is that Aurora Borealis (The Northern Lights) are managing to interfere with radio signals somehow allowing signals from different time periods to come together.Using this useful tool, the son, John Sullivan, tries to save his father's life by telling him he will die in a warehouse fire in the line of his duty as a fireman. The father, Frank, takes his advice to avoid death and is amazed when it works.Obviously causality isn't finished and proceeds to add more layers of events to the story meaning that when you mess with the future, you change more than just what you think you affect.This movie is great fun. It never takes itself especially seriously, and everyone appears to be having a decent time here. Dennis Quaid's Frank has a quiet authority which suits him well, and although his overly southern accent seems a mite contrived to start with, we get used to it. Caviezel, as his grown up son from the future, is pretty decent here too. He comes across as a man who's a bit lost, but when he gets a chance to talk to his father (Who died 30 years ago, hence saving his life) through time, he suddenly seems to have a purpose.All the other players contribute pretty well as well, but this is really the Quaid and Caviezel show.The direction is pretty good too, never getting in the way of a good yarn. It aids the flow really well and manages the old 'edge of your seat' effect well.The only *real* flaw in this is the quite appallingly sugar-sweet ending. It's so sentimental that it incites nauseum. A feel-good ending is only going to work when it's not overplayed and when it uses subtlety. Trying to force the old 'this is a good ending, folks' motto on the viewer leaves a sickly taste in the mouth.But fortunately the rest of the movie's quality lets it stand on its own 2 feet, and the ending fails to ruin it.Overall, not bad, not bad at all.

I saw it for the first time yesterday and I loved how the film played out. It was like watching two films in one. The first half of the movie, when John discovers he's talking to his long dead father on the ham radio, deals purely with the love between a father and son. Cue many scenes of Frank bonding with both son in present and son in future, full of warmth and feeling that make the viewer think 'Ahh, how nice. This is going to be film filled with plenty of I love you son', I love you too Dad tender moments.' Then suddenly, the film changes direction, from a family drama to an exciting thriller, where John and Frank have to deal with the (inevitable) consequences of their actions.The idea of 'change one thing, change everything' is certainly not a new one. It has been done before in time-travel films like the 'Back To The Future' trilogy and 'Peggy Sue Got Married', and more recently the (far inferior) 'Butterfly Effect'. All the unexpected surprises are there &#150; John accidentally saves his father's life, which should surely be a good thing except that this sets off a chain of events (naturally!) that in this case leads to the murder of seven women, including John's mother; John and Frank try to put right their mistake, and it seems to be working, up until the point where Frank is arrested for one of the murders. But what is good about this film with its not-unfamiliar plot, is that it resists the urge to go in the direction that the viewer anticipates. When it appears that John and Frank's good intentions are not working, and everything they do just seems to be making the situation worse, I was anticipating an unhappy, unresolved ending, one that certainly involved Frank's death. A sort of 'the only way to put the universe right is for Frank to die again, to make up for not dying in the first place' kind of ending, where the lesson is clear don't mess with the past. However, happily for me, 'Frequency' resisted this idea, and ended in such a way that it transformed the whole movie into a feel-good experience.Whilst John and Frank are certainly punished for their actions, incredibly they manage to sort it all out and everybody's happy &#150; although I'm not sure if I agree entirely with the ethics of the subplot involving John turning his friend Gordo into a multi millionaire by giving the 8 year old Gordo the idea for Yahoo! I thought this was rather out of keeping with the rest of the film and the character of John he has learnt the hard way that it is a bad idea to try to change past events, yet here he is consciously altering the destiny of his young friend's life!

Not exactly an exceptionally novel idea, but here it is given a new twist &#150; the connection comes via a ham radio that links 1969 with 1999. Father Dennis Quaid exists in the past, but perhaps not for long as his number is supposedly up in a fire to occur. The son, in sudden rushes of ancient memories, warns his father of the event, and of the mention by another firefighter that his father made the mistake of turning the wrong way as he attempted to exit the blaze.The film manages to utilize themes already explored in films such as `Peggy Sue Got Married' and `Back To the Future' and even `Field of Dreams' can be said to have provided some input. Even so, while not entirely original, `Frequency' manages to offer much that is fresh and entertaining, as well as cause a few lumps in the throat.The inherent problem with time travel films &#150; especially those that manage to alter events that occurred in the past, is that old `suspension of disbelief' requirement. If events aren't moving fast enough, the implausibility almost surely will dawn on the viewer.The film almost gets away with it, only at the very end does it trip on its own contrivances, but this viewer was able to forgive it as the human element, the way the characters so endear themselves, made the transgression forgivable if not plausible. Dennis Quaid, a native Texan, does a rather remarkable job of capturing the intonations of a lifelong Queens, New York resident. Being one myself, I think I'm qualified to make such an assessment.  James Caviezel is less successful in that regard, but still he is ingratiating as the son grown to manhood who must come to grips with the forces unleashed by having tampered with time. Because dad was spared on the day of the fire, his wife &#150; a nurse &#150; didn't have to leave her job owing to the emergency, and thus was there to prevent a dosage error that would have proved fatal to a patient. The problem is however that this patient just happens to be a serial killer who is now still managing to provide victims even in 1999.Did I mention that the killer stalks nurses? Unfortunately, now the one who managed to save his life is scheduled to become his next victim.Alright, that's as much as you're going to get in terms of spoilers, as it would be unfair to spoil the rest of the story as father and son in their respective eras must keep the killer from increasing his count of victims. But, in doing so, both men become prey for the killer and both are subject to disbelief by the family friend who is investigating the crime in each era. Andre Brougher plays this character, now the son's supervisor on the 1999 police force. He's practically replaying his role from the TV series `Homicide Life On the Street' but that's not necessarily a bad thing &#150; Brougher is excellent in that role.Sure there are some gaps in logic, and even in presentation, but they didn't dawn on me during the viewing, nor did they detract during a second viewing. As a bonus, the background of the New York Mets winning the 1969 World Series provided a most fascinating subplot that even manages to lend credibility to the claims made by Quaid to Brougher as he is trailing the killer in 1969.Quaid once again gave me reason to wonder why he has never managed to make it onto the `A' list of performers. He's done consistently good work for over 20 years, but has trailed behind the likes of Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas &#150; even though he's probably the better actor. James Caviezel's stock has risen somewhat since this film, and rightfully so. While only in the same scene together once, we can still believe that they are related. A standout performance is also given by Shawn Doyle as the killer &#150; in both eras, and his make-up as the elder version is always convincing.Credit must also be given to scripter Toby Emmerich despite the lapses in logic as his dialog always rings true and his characters really do seem to exist &#150; which had to help immeasurably to what Quaid and Caviezel bring to their performances.

The ways in which the film deals with the thought-provoking concept of changing the past, while certainly blasphemous to the field of physics, sparks some interesting conversation after the credits.  The eerie curlicues of smoky clouds shown in the sky at various intervals attest to the fact that the makers of Frequency do not pretend to have a logical explanation for how two men can be using the same radio at the same desk in the same house to be speaking to each other over a distance of 30 years.  I was so captivated by the secondary plot, an old unsolved murder case that quickly becomes personal when father and son play G-d, that I didn't have a chance to care about the unidimensionality of most of the characters, the flavorless dialogue or the predictability of the action.  My jetlagged eyes were glued to the poor reception I have for a screen for the duration of the film.  Retrospectively, it was no piece of art!

They aren't always entertaining though. Director Gregory Hoblit's movie is all of the above and raise some interesting questions&#133;such as, if you could do something that would save your father's life yet doom you mother what would you do? 	The movie jumps back and forth between the present year of 1999 and 30 years earlier. Detective John Sullivan, James Caviezel, is on the eve of the 30-year anniversary of his fire-fighter father Frank's, Dennis Quaid, death. A scientific phenomena known as The Northern Lights, Aurora Borealis, is once again shining bright above John's house.  	When John's buddy is over checking on him they stumble across Frank's old ham radio. John sets it up in a bout of nostalgia but is unable to get it working. Later, much to John's surprise, the ham radio clicks on and he begins receiving a message from someone in the same city. John begins talking with the man but decides his friends are playing a trick on him as the man claims to be Frank Sullivan. After some discussion John finds he is telling the truth. It seems something in the lights has caused the circuits to do something out of this world and allow John to talk with his father from 30 years before. 	John realizes his father is about to die in an accident and tells him how to avoid it and survive. Frank is at first skeptical but follows through with John's advice and survives the fire that is meant to kill him. As they are talking later that day, John discovers to his horror that his mother is not in a picture that she was in the day before. Something that Frank and John did has caused her death. As they discuss more things they realize that John has reopened an old case, `The Nightingale Murders' which originally only had three victims and now is up to 10&#133;and the most important woman in their lives, John's man and Frank's wife, is one of the next victims.	John and Frank work together to stop some of the murders and identify the killer. Between the three decades they are able to find the killer, stop him, and save the woman who is most important to both of them. 	I liked this movie a lot. As directed by Gregory Hoblit it is surprisingly easy to follow in its jumps back and forth. They keep a very good tie on both decades and make certain to have things that happen in Frank's decade show up almost instantly in John's. This attention to detail is better than most. It even includes broken windows appearing where they weren't before. 	The story is great on two levels. At one we have a son re-connecting with his father. Frank died when John was six and they spend much of the movie getting to know each other. There is so much joy evident in them that it seems as if they have always known each other. It also works as a thriller. As the story goes on, John is instructing his father how to capture the killer. We get tense as the fire fighter is trying to figure out what a cop would be doing. Even here we have father and son working together and teaching each other though the decades. 	The actors are great. James Caviezel portrays John as a sad man who isn't able to connect with others and constantly pushes all away but his mother. As he gets to know his father he is able to connect with more people and opens up on many levels. Dennis Quaid has long been thought of as a highly underrated actor and he shows why here. Frank has two loves in his life, his wife and his son. You see him as a father when John is six and you also see how well he connects with his son as a man. Dennis also successfully passes him off as the man struggling to catch a killer before his wife becomes the victim. 	This movie works. It is a fantasy, thriller, and relationship story with actors you long to see more of. It grips you with its intensity and uplifts you with its love. I strongly recommend this one.

I know its not a great movie, I know you could pick holes left right and centre in the plot and I know the ending was incredibly corny. I'm afraid I'm too English to recognise the bad accents that I see a lot of other people complained about - though I daresay some of the Americans reading this didn't notice that Antony La Paglia's accent as Daphne's brother in Frasier was not only horrendous but horrendous cockney when Daphne's meant to be from Manchester!!) but I digress... The point is (in my humble opinion) that unlike many of todays movies,by the time the plot started to get a little wobbly with its time weaving, you were totally engrossed and cared about the characters. There's not enough effort put into making the audience care about the characters nowadays.In terms of acting - I thought Quaid was fine, was impressed by Caviezel and was disappointed by the under use of Mitchell although she was good. I wonder,does anyone know how she broke her nose during the filming? and does anyone know why filmmakers make fair actresses wear dark wigs that don't suit their colouring?

This one is special because it does what the Fountain and a number of other, recent high concept and message films try but usually fail to accomplish in any meaningful fashion. Frequency moves the heart through the experience of film.

I have read a few of other viewer comments and am taken aback by people getting upset about the central idea behind the time travel communication (the aurora borealis lets Frank Sullivan's ham radio in 1969 communicate with his son John Sullivan (using the same ham radio in the same house) in 1999). People - it's a PLOT DEVICE - get over it! It's just there to get the story started and to add drama. When the writers put in a plot device like this, that's OK - you have to willingly suspend your disbelief. What counts next is, are the writers being internally consistent with the rules they have set up and the conditions in the movie? In Frequency, yes, they are. (Other movies aren't so good about this - don't get me started about Independence Day, where Jeff Goldblum is able to hack into the alien ship's computer system - apparently the aliens use Microsoft Windows too! Come on! They're aliens!)The rules of the plot are that there is the ham radio communication between eras; that it's October 11, 1969 on one end and October 11, 1999, on the other end, and that the two eras are running simultaneously (in a sense). That is, if Frank Sullivan (the father)spends 7-11 p.m. on Oct. 11 in 1969 talking with John Sullivan (his son), this happened for John at 7-11 p.m. on Oct 11, 1999. If something is changed in 1969 at 300 p.m. based on information sent from 1999, then the world of 1999 doesn't update till 300 p.m. of that same date in 1999. This is set up and reinforced by the good editing, constantly flashing back between one era and the next. So the writers set up these groundrules, use them as a basis, and then go into a very moving tale of father-son love, growing up, redemption, and second chances. I found the contact between the two men very believable. At first they're just chatting together on the radio; Frank says something about You think the Mets will win Game One of the Series tomorrow? John, of course, knows that the Mets lost Game One because it was 30 years ago for him, and makes some comment about that. (It was all over after Buford's homer in the second inning.) Then, of course, the ham radio loses contact. But the next night, Frank asks John, How'd you know about Buford's homer? And John says, It wasn't hard, buddy, it was 30 years ago. Then John gets more information (Frank's name, call letters, etc) and realizes who he is talking to. He desperately wants to warn his father about Frank's upcoming death in the warehouse fire which is going to happen tomorrow. But Frank doesn't want to listen, thinks John is crazy or a stalker or something - just can't believe it. John says If you had just gone the other way in the fire you would have gotten out - if you had just gone the other way! Then, of course, the ham radio stops working.Frank is pensive the next day, because everything so far has turned out as John has said it would (Al Weis hits a game-winning RBI in the 9th)and he is thinking, Is this guy for real? Might I be going to die today? When the climactic moment in the fire comes, Frank does go the other way, and saves his own life. John is sitting in a bar drinking with his friends in memory of his father, 30 years after his death. There is a very effective sequence where Frank is making his decision and escaping from the fire, and John is in the bar and getting new memories of a life where Frank lived on. I particularly like the intercutting where John drops his glass in the bar (in slo-mo), Frank has thrown his fireman's hat out of a window and that is falling (in slo-mo), and Frank and the person he saved from the fire are going down a warehouse chute (in slo-mo)away from the fire, into the river. The editors cut from shot to shot with very moving music from Michael Kamen, the composer, here. At the end of the scene, Frank is outside the warehouse watching it burn and realizing he is alive! and that this guy on the radio is for real; John is in the bar with his friends realizing that his father didn't die in a fire 30 years ago, but died from lung cancer 10 years ago, and John has memories from both of these timelines. That evening, Frank comes home, and talks to John. He realizes that hey, this is not a fake, it's really my son from the future (wow!)and they have a long talk together. This, to me, was the best part of the film. In the beginning of the movie, John Sullivan is a bitter, jaded, cigarette-smoking alcoholic cop who is breaking up with his girlfriend. As he talks w/his father, you can see him smoothing out old bitternesses and fears. His father is there for him now and that makes all the difference. You see the two of them chatting about various topics, sort of guy talk that is a coverup for their deep joy in being able to communicate with each other. At the end of the scene, Frank is able to say, I love you, son, and John responds, I love you too, Dad. I've missed you so much! and Frank knows what he means/meant to his son. Of course, up to this point is only half the movie, so they still have to continue the plot with the serial nurse killer stuff. That was well-written and a good thriller, but to me, not as moving as just the quiet conversation between the two men on the ham radio, the father and the son connecting. Advice to the viewer be sure to check on EVERYTHING in the background - photographs (who's in it right now? Is Dad missing? Is Mom missing? Is the dog missing?); newspaper headlines (Fireman Dies In Warehouse Fire is changed to Fireman Saves Runaway From Warehouse Fire); radio and TV commentary (note that the physics professor talking about the aurora borealis is on the Dick Cavett show in both 1969 and 1999!) and even the decor of the house in 1999. At first, when John's father died 30 years ago and his mother is living in an apartment somewhere, it's a rather gloomy cop dwelling. Then John changes the past & his father didn't die; John comes home from work, and notices that the lamps have changed, things look different. Next, it turns out that his mother has died in 1969, and again the house looks more bachelor-ish and less like a woman has done stuff to it. At the end, (SPOILER WARNING) in the future where both his parents lived, there is a major morph, and things look shipshape, tidy, and well-decorated. This is the kind of thing that you have to see the movie a few times to pick up on. It's also not always obvious due to camera angles, editing, etc. The ending is a major cop-out (no pun intended) in terms of being internally consistent to the rules that were set up. (SPOILER WARNING) In 1969, Frank has managed to expose Jack Shepard as the serial killer, so Jack comes to Frank's house to kill him and his family. In 1999, before Frank exposes Jack Shepard, John Sullivan meets Jack Shepard in a bar and tells Jack that he knows that Jack is the serial killer. So now Jack Shepard in 1999 is coming to the house to kill John. There is very effective and exciting intercutting between the two confrontations (Frank vs Jack, John vs Jack 30 years later) but if you think about it, it doesn't hold water. Frank shoots Jack in 1969, (shoots off Jack's right hand), and then you're supposed to believe that a one-handed ex-cop murderer fugitive from justice was able to hang around for 30 years to come and mess with John? If you listen to the director's commentary on the DVD, the director does make note of this and suggested a different, internally consistent ending be filmed. However, apparently test audiences reacted so positively to the current ending (SPOILER WARNING) (Frank is still alive in 1999, comes in and blows away Jack Shepard with his shotgun) that the other ending was never filmed. I have to admit that the ending as it is right now, is pretty satisfying emotionally, though. I'm a sucker for a happy ending and this movie does have one (SPOILER WARNING) It's a neighborhood softball game in Queens. Frank is still there, alive and well, having neither died of lung cancer or in a fire; Julia (Frank's wife) is also there, happy and healthy; John gets a game-winning RBI hit to knock in his father; John's wife (his girlfriend that he broke up with at the beginning of the movie in his alternate history) is there with their son; Frank has quit smoking, John either never started smoking or quit smoking, and nobody is an alcholic; life is good. I thought it was a tightly edited movie as well; John and Frank talk on the ham radio; Julia, John-as-a-6-year-old, and John's friend Gordo-as-a-6-year-old also talk on the ham, but the only one who knows that this is the future talking, is Frank. The writers could have had it that other people know, but they maintained the dramatic tension by having it be just Frank and John talking to each other. (Frank does tell his cop friend Satch, but Satch doesn't believe him and the radio is broken so Satch can't talk with the 1999 John). I'm the kind of person that asks hypothetical questions about movies, so now I'm wondering, If Frank comes in in 1999 and saves his son John, and the ham radio is still active, does Frank in 1999 talk to himself in 1969? Does he tell himself, Hey, we've gotta be here at this date and time to save John - write it down in your dayplanner? What would it be like, talking to your future self, anyway? Did Frank in 1969 ever tell Julia (his wife) about his conversations with their future son? As Frank lives through 1969-1999, does he ever talk to young John about talking with the 1999 John? Or does he just know that he can't talk about all this till it happens for John in 1999? (He does know some things that will happen to John - e.g., John blows his arm out, can't be a baseball player, goes to the police academy, becomes a cop.) At the end of the movie with all the changes that have been made in John's life, does he have three sets of memories? (one with Frank dying in 1969, one with Frank living and Julia dying in 1969, and one with both of his parents living through to the present day). Or does the current reality gradually supersede the old memories and the old memories fade away? Or do they remain? (hey, in my previous life, I was a single, alcoholic, bitter, jaded cop and now I have a family)?I guess that both Frank and John could look at it this way We each came close to death and cheated it by an amazing set of coincidences; let's make the most of the life we have left. In the end, that's good advice for all of us.

I must admit, that there were some enjoyable aspects of Frequency but overall the film makers were so desperate to get the audience to cry (or have the sensation of sentimentality) that they submitted to some bad cliche's of film making.  There are many who like to separate the film as art from film as entertainment, but I believe that is difficult in this case, because there were too many parts where the director used artsy film making tactics to get his message across.  The OVERuse of slow motion and repeated shots from different angles was an example of pretentiousness at it's worst.  I couldn't help but roll my eyes on several occasions, especially during some of the dialog between the father and the son.  The writing, at times, was very poor.  It just seemed as though the film makers were trying too hard.I have even enjoyed some sentimental type films of the past few years (Shawshank Redemption, Good Will Hunting, Life is Beautiful) but this movie was lacking the skill that those film makers possess.  There was also the problem of once you lose the audience here, that we start to notice other intricacies, such as the problems with time travel. I think Back to the Future handled the genre much better because normal logic allowed those films to work.  In those movies Michael J. Fox's character was himself traveling through time, so the audience could accept when he changed events, and arrived back in time that they would change. (They also provided an explanation)  In Frequency the logic was terribly flawed.  Most of the time when an event in the past changed everything surrounding it changed.  But sometimes when something in the past changed, only some things in the future changed.  It just didn't make sense, especially the climactic end scene, which was ridiculous. Again, I did think at times the suspense was done well, and I was interested, but overall there were too many flaws for me to recommend it.

Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre Braugher and Elizabeth Mitchell star in this magical journey that will leave each member of the viewing audience in awe and breathless.Frequency joins Love Story, Men Of Honor, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan and Finding Forrester as six of my favorite films, which deserve the title of masterpieces. My reasons for making this statement are the unique concept of the film, superb writing and strong performances.Congratulations to the writers for creating one of the best scripts brought to screen since Titanic. I kept smiling throughout this film because it explored the unbreakable bond father and son share with one another. I knew Frequency would become a powerful and special film as soon as I saw the trailer for the first time. I was in shock when Frequency was left off the academy award ballot.Frequency is laced with storylines that would light up a dark room and brighten anyone's dark days. Frequency contains intense, adrenaline pumping action with edge of your seat suspense, excitement and drama.Frequency is a unique film that ranks in the top ten movies I've seen all year. Frequency is a unique film that will never be made again and if the chance arose this type of film is made; it will never measure up to the greatness of this film.Quaid, Caviezel, Mitchell and Braugher come together to bring one of the finest films to life. In the spirit of Ghost, Frequency is an epic story about father and son who reunite over the ham radio 30 years after Frank's death. However, throughout their conversations, they unintentionally alter the past and become thrust into a serial murder investigation. The cast support Frequency receives is powerful and rich.Quaid is one actor everyone can count on to give 110 percent in every film he stars. Frequency is one in a long string of films that keeps me in shock and asking the question why he hasn't had the opportunity to win academy awards since his performances were deserving.Caviezel's resume may not be high in quantity but it is high in quality, yet he is a tremendous asset to each film he stars in. Caviezel may not be a Hollywood veteran quite yet; but with his charisma, screen presence, integrity and intensity he deserves the title of veteran.Braugher provides great support in his role as Caviezel's partner and Quaid's friend in Frequency. I have always enjoyed Braugher from his role on the television series, Homicide Life On The Street because his presence is felt with each scene was in; a fact which holds true in every film he is in. I look forward to each film he is in because like Quaid he gives 110 percent.I know I have consistently said music and soundtracks are one of the most powerful selling points of a film. From Trisha Yearwood's rendition of 'How Do I Live' for Con Air to Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' in Titanic comes a song so powerful and touching it will leave you in tears. Garth Brooks rendition of 'When You Come Back To Me Again' put icing on the cake and made me watch this film.Upon listening to this song, everyone will get a sense of what this movie is about. This is one the top five soundtrack songs that I've heard in my life because it is the perfect companion to an already perfect movie.Only one word comes to mind when describing my overall feeling of this film EXCELLENCE. Every part of Frequency is excellent. From the powerful and moving performances to the edge of your seat drama, Frequency will delight and amaze every viewer.It is my honor to let everyone know Frequency is one of the best films of 2000. I have seen Frequency so many times I've stopped counting after 10. Frequency is an A+ in my book.

The heart of this picture is the father and son relationship between Frank and John Sullivan (Dennis Quaid as the father from 1969, Jim Caviezel as his son in 1999).  You can't help rooting for them, they are both decent people caught up in something completely outside of their own experiences.  Shawn Doyle is especially creepy as the villain, his performance is liked a toned down version of Andrew Robinson's Scorpio character in Dirty Harry.

It happened thirty years ago. John finds his fathers old ham radio and plugged it in.  Then a man came on it and John realized he was speaking to his dad in 1969. Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) John's father was finally convinced after some things John said would come true did, that he was speaking on his ham radio to his son in 1999, yet neither knew how it was possible.  They really didn't care.  They were just happy for their luck. John then tells Frank that he will die in two days if he goes to work that day.  Frank took precautions that day and lived.  John had all these new memories of his father, but then realized that he couldn't remember anything to do with his mother. John, being a cop found out that his mother was brutally murdered thirty years ago.  He got on the ham radio and told his dad.  So through mixture of cunning and well acted scenes, Frank and John work together in the past and present to get the killer before he gets their wife/mother. The movie makes us realize that sometimes we wish that we could change the past but that sometimes it is better left untouched, everything in life happens for a reason.  If we could change the past, we could be destroying the future. I loved this movie.  I thought it was moving, exciting, and well thought through.  It left me fulfilled in the end.

This is the first time I've seen it since I saw it in the theaters.  And I liked it almost as much as the first time.I'm a 34 year old guy and I look back on the year 2000 and its movies and music with sentimentally like no other year since my high school & college years in the 80's.  And this movie was one of the reasons for my sentimentality.  Like Field of Dreams, it has as part of its many themes, baseball and the bond between fathers and sons - and its just as effective in helping us appreciate how important the (unfortunately underappreciated) father and son bond is through cinema.  But that's just for starters. Imagine trying to pitch this movie to a studio head.  The practice is to encapsulate it into a couple of words - a sound bite  sort of  - to make it 'sellable' for the studio head.  Like a buddy comedy, for the female demographic, dramedy, sci-fi/adventure, mystery/thriller, etc. There is no way to do that with this movie.  Its part Sci-Fi, its part nostalgia/sentimental pic, part cop/mystery, part thriller, part family/father-son pic, part tear jerker, & I'm sure you can find more elements.  There is simply no other movie like it - its an original.  It complements Field of Dreams quite well in that it covers the same emotional territory but 'mines' it more directly.  I will never forget where and at what time of my life I had seen these two movies when they were released in the theaters and how thoroughly satisfied I was - they were magical experiences.  The Bravo channel did an episode of  their From Page to Screen series on Field of Dreams, and they spent a lot of time talking about how that movie brought grown men to tears when it came to the heartfelt subject matter of the father and son bond in this movie. Playing catch with your father for a boy is so much more than most women can probably understand.  This movie evokes the same spirit.It was good to see Dennis Quaid again in a crowd pleaser like this - the last time was in  Inner Space with Martin Short and Meg Ryan.  And it really seems to have launched the careers of the actor who played his son, James Caviezel, and the screenplay writer Toby Emmerich.  Before this film, according to IMDb, Emmerich had been the soundtrack executive on many movies.  After Frequency,  IMDb shows, he apparently became producer of many mainstream large budget movies.  But he hasn't written another screenplay.  Makes me curious as to how the screenplay came about and the writer's inspiration and why Emmerich hasn't gotten another on screen.The only objectionable part of the film was the graphic, sadistic visuals of the victims of the Nightingale Serial Murderer.  If they were much more tame with that part of the story, it would have become more appropriate for entire families to enjoy as a classic for many years to come.  In other words they should have gone for a 'PG' rating, instead of 'PG-13' rating, which IMDb says is for intense violence and disturbing images in the case of 'Frequency'.   Otherwise it would have been a movie with something for all kinds of movie goers.  I have a suspicion that New Line and its history of horror film making had something to do with it or that history has made them used to OKing and making that sort of story.  Too bad.  When I know in advance that a movie has those kind of scenes, I vote with my dollars and make it a point not 'patronize' them.  Luckily, I don't think they used any of those scenes in their promotions.  On those grounds I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars (which is only 1 more than the average voted by IMDb voters at this time).Actually, I don't remember it having much of a massive ad campaign.  I had seen very little about it on the entertainment and talk show circuits - oh yeah - I didn't have a TV that year (with the quality of television & media in general it actually was a blessing really).  It was good thing because, I imagine I had the kind of experience that people in the 1930's & 1940's did. Walking into a movie theater back then you had a totally novel/virgin experience of a film because you didn't get bombarded with commercials and trailers that give away half the movie as you do nowadays.  I always treasure those movie experiences in which I discover it for the first time when I walk in the theater and I'm blown away by the experience of being immersed in a unique world.  That was the kind of experience this movie was - leaving me walking on air afterwards for an hour or so.  This movie deserves to stand the test of time like 'Field of Dreams'.

The film's original promo played up the 'change your destiny' aspect of the plot more than the father-son bond, and I guess I thought there'd be some souped-up DeLorean auto waiting in the wings to whisk people somewhere every 10 minutes. But this film is nothing like that. I lost my mother sixteen years ago and have only bonded stronger with my dad since then, and as such, relate to the film's subtler message of re-affirming ties with those you love the most. It doesn't hit on this immediately. When  detective Caviezel first speaks to fireman Quaid, they are understandably confused and pseudo-annoyed with one other. Later, of course, the confusing 30-year paradox is revealed and a new relationship emerges. The 'duo-logue' which follows between father and son over the radio is a breathtaking scene, and when it comes to an end (I'm almost afraid to turn this off- like we won't get this back), I'm in tears (of joy) every single time.

In Gregory Hoblit's &#145;Frequency' we are given even greater hope in a story that I found to be captivating to say the least. This movie uses the notion of time travel in a clever way, and shows that love cannot be held back by any obstacle.On October 11, 1999 one day before the anniversary of his father's death, 36 year old jaded cop, John Sullivan comes across his father's old ham radio. It is a night of bizarre weather with the aurora borealis dominating the night sky and, as John plays around with the radio, he finds himself talking to a man who sounds strangely familiar.  When he discovers the man is in fact his father talking to him on the same day but in 1969, John realises he has the power to save his father from dying and create the future that might have been. It is a chance no loving son could pass up, but one that might ultimately plays with destiny, bringing with it another terror for John's family to endure &#150; one that must be fought on both sides of the time barrier.Frequency is a movie that has many strange elements within it. The story written by Toby Emmerich, has such feeling that you have to like it. But what I found most fascinating is the way the story toys with certain circumstances, making things &#145;just happen', that normally would not be able to happen. Toby incorporated some great themes into the movie as well. The ideas of time travel in Frequency, while unbelievable, were interesting having the father and son being able to communicate via an old radio, 30 years apart. Then there is the themes of family, communication and support, which are all vital to the final make up of the story. The movie stars Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), a 1969 fire-fighter who dies while trying to save a life in a warehouse fire.  Frank's son, John (Jim Cavizel) has broken with family tradition and become a policeman rather than a fire-fighter. The pair miraculously start to communicate, when John finds his father's old ham radio. Initially, they cannot believe what is happening, but after some facts are spoken by John, they both realise they are &#145;father and son'. In &#145;Frequency', the relationship that Frank and John share is a highlight of the movie and crucial to many of the events that happen as you get deeper and deeper into the film.Other stars include Julia Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell), Frank's wife and John's mum, who is totally unaware of what is happening while Frank is on his radio. What happens to her character is of major importance to the story. The bad guy in the story is a crooked cop Jack Shepherd (Shawn Doyle), who fights both father and son in a two separate battles 30 years apart. These two characters and others such as Satch DeLorean (Andre Braugher) are young characters in 1969, but made to look older in 1999.This reminds me of the &#145;Back To The Future' movies. &#145;Frequency' does copy many of the elements from those movies, including the way that time paradoxes can be changed in the present, if interfered with in the past. I will never forget &#145;Doc Brown' continuously warning Marty of such disasters in &#145;BBTF'. The &#145;Frequency' story sounds partially like that of the new movie release, &#145;Minority Report', where they can find criminals, before they actually commit their crime. What is also interesting are the little coincidences that seem to happen when both Frank and John play with time so they can be sure what is happening is real. For instance, Frank communicates with John via writing on the same desk in 1969 &#145;I'm still here chief', when it suddenly appears in front John in 1999. Now normally those burn marks would have been there for 30 years, but not in this movie. Frequency suggests that any action in the past or the present changes the other timeline, making the future something new and in most cases, better. There are many strange circumstances throughout this film, which although it did get confusing many times, were brilliant to see being played out.&#145;Frequency' was released a few months after the M. Night Shyamalan supernatural phenomenon,' The Sixth Sense'. If you loved that movie, than you will love &#145;Frequency', as these movies share one thing in common, real human emotion. I know I felt it all the way through the entire experience of this film. Sure some parts of &#145;Frequency' have to be questioned, but that is the reason why I feel it is a supernatural kind of movie. Frequency can be accused of trying to do too much, which in most films would distract from the final product, but not here. This film is quite a unique &#145;sci-fi, drama, thriller', with a different twist. Would this story ever happen in our lifetime? No, but it would be freaky if it could....CMRS gives &#145;Frequency' 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film) "},{"Title":"Very, Very Good Film","Date":"29 January 2003","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Spacey, soon-to-be-divorced cop John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is toying with his deceased fathers old HAM radio one night, when, through some odd twist of fate so common in sci-fi films, he contacts his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 30 years in the past.Hold on, it gets much better.Frank, who is a firefighter, died in a flaming building when John was 6.

It would have been a nice half  hour Twilight Zone episode, but I would initially  have thought that it would drag if it were even  made into a one hour TV special. Yet I was  pleasantly surprised to find unusual depth and  reflection. Father and son Frank and John  Sullivan gain the unexpected boon of being  able to twist the flow of history to their  mutual favor, but in doing so learn that it isn't as simple as it at first appeared and the consequences are suitably more involved that either could have foreseen. The  complications that arise are well quite well put together, and the ending, I felt, came together in a satisfyingly neat climax.Frequency manages to have enough depth to  make it worth sitting through a feature  length film without becoming so absurdly  convoluted that you need a PhD to understand  the plot; that is a rare combination that  makes it a winner well worth seeing.

From the future, John is able to communicate his father's impending doom and helps Frank avert the disaster (by the way, this isn't exactly a spoiler, since it takes place within the first 20 minutes of the movie). A sad ending is turned into a happy one, right? Not quite. Frank's survival changes the course of history (at least, the personal history of his family) and sets an entirely new chain of events in motion. The result is a roller coaster ride of a film.

Characters can cheat death, and tomorrow can alter yesterday. Inferior sci-fi epics depend entirely on these narrative gimmicks to lend credibility to their far-fetched escapades, while the best use this inherent flaw largely as a means to launch their plots. Typically, too, the human element qualifies as the first casualty in many sci-fi films. Happily, director Gregory (Primal Fear) Hoblit and screenwriter Toby Emmerich have avoided these characteristic pitfalls in Frequency, an exciting and sentimental yarn about a deceased dad and his grown-up son who bond 30 years after the father's death when a weird weather phenomenon allows them to contact each other on an antique ham radio. Not only do they catch up on things in general, but also they pursue a depraved serial killer (Shawn Doyle) who has been slicing and dicing nurses since 1969.Nothing seems to be going right for moody 36-year old N.Y.P.D.

Everything wrong in Sullivan's life stems from the accidental death of his firefighter father. When John was age six, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid of Any Given Sunday) died in a warehouse blaze trying to rescue a girl. John misses a father he barely knew. Frank was an heroic fireman who selflessly risked his life in every emergency. Eventually, Frank's luck ran out, and John cannot reconcile the loss until he tunes up his dad's ham radio.Initially, Frank and John think somebody is playing a prank on them. We must be talking off the mother spot of all time, marvels Frank. The common interest they shared for the 1969 New York Mets baseball team convinces them that each is on the level with the other. John warns his dad about the ill-fated warehouse fire and suggests that Frank take a different exit. Frank follows his son's advice and survives the conflagration. Unfortunately, changing the past triggers a domino effect of complications. A murderer stalking nurses on the streets of New York claims John's mother Julia Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell) as one of his victims. Suddenly, history takes a turn for the worse as John attempts to unravel the past and resurrect his mom. Although Frank knows nothing about police work, John coaches him. Together they try to thwart an evil, ingenious villain who winds up incriminating Frank.The emotional chemistry between actors Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel makes this memorable saga worth watching. Shrewdly, director Gregory Hoblit gives neither of them an easy way out of any predicament. Toby Emmerich has penned a superlative time travel tale that combines the best elements of Field of Dreams with the James Stewart classic It's A Wonderful Life.

The film sees John Sullivan, a New York detective, still struggling to come to terms with the loss of his beloved father Frank thirty years previously. However, a rare atmospheric phenomenon (some sort of solar flares) allows him to communicate with Frank thirty years into the past over their HAM radio. But when John uses this freak chance to warn his father of his death, he inadvertently changes his own time resulting in a serial killer roaming around, murdering various women including John's own mother. Working with a gulf of thirty years between them, John and Frank must find a way to stop the killer without changing history too radically.The leads of James Caviezel and Dennis Quaid, as John and Frank respectively, give excellent, strong performances in their roles. Caviezel perfectly depicts John's grief over the lasting effect his father's death had over his life, his joy at being able to speak to his father and prevent any harm befalling him and his despair and helplessness of the consequences his actions have as they ripple through time. Equally, Quaid gives a great portrayal as Frank, a decent honourable man who dearly loves his family even if his son is an adult thirty years in the future. They not only leave audiences caring for their plight but create a realistic father/son bond despite the fact they are barely appear together in the same room and age-wise there is only about ten years between them.'Frequency' is a film that strikes a nice balance between cop suspense, sci-fi, family bonding and emotional turmoil. The interesting characters and a plot that is well-paced and involving keep the audience engaged through the whole film. It manages to convey what is a very unique idea very well, dealing with trivial things such as John having to prove who he is to his father and even managing a chat to the child version of his long-time friend, wrapping everything up in a manner that is satisfying, albeit a tad too sentimental.This is definitely a film not to be missed for those who enjoy detective thrillers and want to see one with a difference.

It also deals with the space/time continuum idea not all too far removed from Back to the Future, but certainly not ina comedy sense.  These types of movies are a guilty pleasure.

And that's great because it really gives the film a throwback feel because in a way this whole film is a Twilight Zone tale which were always about ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.The production value I think is great despite very few special effects, which to me just adds to the film's throwback feel and I feel is another example of sci-fi working without minimum to no effects, even the TV show The Twilight Zone had almost zero effects and that show is legendary. Music score I think is very good, it really fits the film because in some places it has an emotional sensibility or even in the suspenseful situations intensity.However two of the things that stand out for me for this film are the use of both the suspense thriller and time travel format. I really love how both of them are just a beautiful combination and most time travel stories by their nature are suspense thriller because it's about stopping something before it occurs. For the time travel aspect I really like that they did something different with it for once, where instead of traveling in time it's communicating with another time period. Personally I think it's a interesting and creative idea, and it really works as we see certain cause and effect physics where in the past the desk gets burned and then suddenly you see that same spot in the present knowing it wasn't there before. Yeah, I know a real head turner but that's what makes it fun.Also what they do with the suspense thriller format where in most usually were always a step ahead of the protagonists and the suspense is hopping they figure it out sooner than later. But here for once the protagonists are a step ahead, they have the means and the tool for the job. It's still really suspenseful because it's all based on the cause and effect principle, where something happens in one time period will affect what happens in the other, it's all a matter of how the protagonists utilize the principle to their advantage.However the other thing that really makes this film stand out for me is that it has a lot of heart because it has characters you actually feel a deep sense of pathos for. You literally want the protagonists to win because you actually feel the outcome really does matter.It really does have a really solid cast most TV alums, like Elesbeth Mitchell from TV's Lost and Once Upon a Time which is ironic since those shows are mysteries based on cause and effect. Andre Braugher from Broklin Nine Nine, Jim Caviezel from Person of Interest which I'll admit is really ironic if you've ever seen the show. And of course Denis Quaid whom I think is an underrated actor to me this is one of my favorite roles from him.I really like the dynamic between both Frank (Denis Quaid) and John (Jim Caviezel) Suliven. The father son dynamic is interesting because it's mainly both of them in the same room and radio but in different time periods. It's really touching and even a bit sad since we already know Frank died, or even as we see in a really sad scene another tragedy occur with the mom. But this is just all the more motivation for the protagonists to win, you could say what's happening isn't just a coincidence in nature but it could be God or fate giving them a chance to right what once when wrong.I really like how they interact and work together in the situation their in. Even how they react toward the whole phenomenon of communicating with each other in different time periods, it feels like how anyone of us might react. Their in the same boat as us they have no idea why or how this is all really happening.But I really like the certain amount of depth both have like the fact Frank is a Baseball fun which is cool since I like Baseball. Even certain things that happened in their lives like Franks smoking and John's marriage problem and both actually help each other out. I really like those scenes when both are just simply talking to each other which is touching because it feels like the kind of conversations you have with you own father or parents. Which in a way makes the film as a whole more of a story on the love of a father and son as well as parents and siblings. And of course the film is actually gives me a good feeling at the end which I don't get enough even from the sci-fi genre.This film is loud and clear.Rating 4 stars "}{"Title":"one of the most original movies ever done.","Date":"9 August 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Frequency is one of the most unique stories ever told.

Instead of waiting for the viewer to raise the inevitable questions about such a premise, it proceeds to raise them and supply its own answers in an accelerating whirl of complications until most of us have no choice but to suspend disbelief and follow the filmmakers' lead. In this devotion to the theme of revealed fate, it somewhat resembles Rene Clair's It Happened Tomorrow.Second, it differs from most fantasies of this kind in quickly eliminating the chance that reality will be restored to its original state in the end. It's not telling too much to mention that there is no power of time travel here, no way of looping back and resetting events. Events can only move forward. Knowing this, we watch all the more raptly to see how the characters will manage. There's no need to become a believer in time-warp theory. The narrative maze is all that really matters.Unlike It Happened Tomorrow, Frequency is not a comedy. It may have structural elements of farce, but the substance is a combination of grim suspense and touching personal drama. Again unlike It Happened Tomorrow, this is not a classic. It's ultimately banal entertainment with a common problem confusion about the place it will occupy on the movie-viewer's menu. It ought to fit neatly into the category of civilized family-oriented melodrama, but parents who remember how things look to a small child will probably want theirs to be spared seeing the uglier moments in this film. Those moments are not many or extreme, but they're enough to compromise the position of Frequency as fare for absolutely the whole family. Still, think of it as appealing to young adults, however you may construe that term, and you won't be far wrong.Frequency is worth seeing once in any case, and more than once if you really must understand how the plot ticks.

Here, Toby Emmerich (it's his only screenwriting credit of his career; he's a studio exec/producer predominantly) lays out a credible, well thought out story that's as tight as any time-twist tale could be.A sweet but seemingly inconsequential line between the young parents of Johnny, frustrated at his failures in learning to ride a bike, came back to explain why the adult John may have been difficult to live with as a husband. He just needs to know that you're behind him, (paraphrased) says the mother to her husband. Well, the father wasn't because he dies the next day, and the vacuum is felt by an adult John.The science of radio transmissions into the future/past can be suspended because there is sufficient poignancy and pathos between father-son, husband-wife, and between friends.

I won't say whether he survives, but the next scenes, which could be  flashbacks, show him with his wife and his young son John.In 1999, the Northern lights are once again visible in New York City, and homicide detective John Sullivan is about to get a very complicated case, which will soon grow even more complex thanks to a discovery made by some of his friends  a ham radio used by John's father before his death 30 years earlier.  After he and his friends fix the radio, John starts talking on it and finds someone else out there.  He later realizes that he is talking to his own father 30 years in the past.  Both men believe someone is playing a prank, but Frank has an accident with a cigarette, and all of a sudden John sees a burn mark that wasn't there before. John convinces Frank he is real by telling him what happened in the 1969 World Series, and then John warns his father about the fire that killed him.  It is quite exciting to watch history change, because we go back and forth between 1969 and 1999 and then, at the precise moment things change, we see flashbacks of scenes that may or may not have happened the first time.Frank is very appreciative, and he and John develop quite a relationship.  Frank enjoys life more and appreciates what he has, but John must deal with memories he didn't have before, which result in unpleasant dreams.  And then the 30-year-old murder case he is working on takes a disturbing turn.  With Frank's help, he has the chance to stop at least some of the murders, and to catch the person who may have committed them.  It's quite interesting, and somewhat like the 'Back to the Future' movies, when Frank passes along evidence to be used in the case.This was an exciting movie, and it had a number of tender moments with a unique father-and-son relationship.  I particularly enjoyed a scene where John as an adult talked to his lifelong friend Gordo as a child. Both lead actors were quite good, and so was Andre Braugher, who played one of the detectives on the murder case in both 1969 and 1999, though I didn't think he looked that much younger in 1969.  There were exciting scenes of action, and chilling moments where the movie moved slowly but still kept my attention.  It was funny sometimes to watch both Frank and John try to convince people they were not crazy.  I always enjoy these situations where someone who knows the future can change it.

Most movies made these days lack heart.  Maybe it's too weak to produce a movie that makes the audience feel, I don't know.  I'm a sentimental guy, so, this one went straight to my heart.  The second time I saw it, I dragged my dad & mom to the theatre with me.I love the concept of time travel and the way that films glorify ordinary men as outstanding heroes.  Frequency is the epitome of both.  The underlying message in this story is the way one man's entire world changes after the loss of his father.  I'm biased in this review because I think Jim Caviezel is one of the greats of the new actor breed.  He has a soft spoken intensity that fills the screen.  He was ominous in The Thin Red Line and just as good here.  Also, I'm a huge Dennis Quaid fan.  I noticed a lot of women in the theater were really charmed by him, too.  Even my mom.  Anyway....I do believe that all the points of this film were explained but, for me, I just liked the personal feel it gives off.  There is a lot of magic in the presence of 'Dad' in a young boy's eyes.  To make him a firefighter made him even more great.  Quaid's Frank Sullivan was a true blue American of yesteryear, a real patriot who loves baseball, his family, his neighborhood and being a fireman.Flash forward 30 years, and we find the grown version of Frank's son Johnny struggling to be a good man.  He's bitter and dark, searching for a taste of hope.  This being a movie, he absolutely finds it via an old ham radio.Frequency isn't fluff, though.  No, it's a clever twist on the murder mystery genre and works very, very well.  Lending great support are the amazing Andre Braugher, lovely Elizabeth Mitchell and a variety of interesting characters who set the mood for 1969 New York.I won't spoil this film by revealing anymore, but, I will say that the woodburned message really got me.  Frequency is living proof that the magic of movies is not lost.  Please, please check out this movie.  I guarantee you it is worth it!

Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre Braugher and Elizabeth Mitchell star in this magical journey that will leave each member of the viewing audience in awe and breathless.Frequency joins Men Of Honor, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan and Finding Forrester as my five of my favorite films, which deserve the title of masterpiece. My reasons for making this statement are the unique concept of the film, superb writing and strong performances.Congratulations to the writers for creating one of the richest scripts brought to screen since Titanic. I kept smiling throughout this film because it explored the unbreakable bond father and son share with one another. I knew Frequency would become a powerful and special film as soon as I saw the trailer for the first time. I was in awe and shock when Frequency was left off the academy award ballot.Frequency is laced with storylines that would put light in a dark room and brighten anyone's dark days. Frequency is laced with intense, adrenaline pumping action with edge of your seat suspense, excitement and drama. This unique film ranks in the top ten movies I've seen all year. Frequency is a unique film that will never be made again and if the chance arose this type of film is made; it will never measure up to the greatness of this film.Quaid, Caviezel, Mitchell and Braugher come together to bring one of the finest films to life. In the spirit of Ghost, Frequency is an epic story about father and son who reunite over the ham radio 30 years after Frank's death. However, throughout their conversations, they unintentionally alter the past and become thrust into a serial murder investigation. The cast support Frequency receives is powerful and rich.Quaid is an actor you can count on to give 110 percent in each performance he gives. Frequency is the latest in a long string of films that keeps me in shock and asking the question why he hasn't had the opportunity to win academy awards since his performances were deserving.Caviezel's resume may not be high in quantity but it is high in quality, yet he is a tremendous asset to each film he stars in. Caviezel may not be a Hollywood veteran quite yet; but with his charisma, screen presence, integrity and intensity he deserves the title of veteran.Braugher provides great support in his role as Caviezel's partner and Quaid's friend in Frequency. I have always enjoyed Braugher from his role on the series, Homicide Life On The Street because his presence is felt with each scene was in; a fact which holds true in every film he is in. I look forward to each film he is in because like Quaid he gives 110 percent.I know I have consistently said music and soundtracks are one of the most powerful selling points of a film. From Trisha Yearwood's rendition of 'How Do I Live' for Con Air to Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' in Titanic comes a song so powerful and touching it will leave you in tears. Garth Brooks rendition of 'When You Come Back To Me Again' put icing on the cake and made me watch this film. Upon listening to this song, everyone will get a sense of what this movie is about. This is one the top five soundtrack songs that I've heard in my life because it is the perfect companion to an already perfect movie.Only one word comes to mind when describing my overall feeling of this film EXCELLENCE. Every part of Frequency is excellent. From the powerful and moving performances to the edge of your seat drama, Frequency will delight and amaze every viewer. It is my honor to let everyone know Frequency is one of the best films of 2000. I have seen Frequency so many times I've stopped counting after 10. Frequency is an A+ in my book.

The words Back to the Future come to mind. However, except for a few glitches in the script (how come the radio connection between the past and the present are lagged exactly thirty years and synchronized for the exact same day, regardless of leap years and other technicalities?), this story is smarter than the average, not to mention the carrying out of it.While the movie does have the Hollywood nature, it has some other features as well, which makes it stand out. With a few lapses, it manages to shift between cliffhanger scenes and less serious scenes, some which at least seem like intended irony and casual attitude towards the story itself.Furthermore, the camera work is excellent, including some reoccurring themes building up the intensity. Slow motion shots of falling objects illustrate the importance of a few fatal moments in the movie, and the lighting crew has done a good job.The makeup crew seems to have gone ballistic in a few instances, and this disturbs the credibility of some characters, who are otherwise competently presented by such admirable actors as Andre Braugher from Homicide Life on the Street.The main upside of Frequency is its ability to surprise and keep the excitement on a relatively high level, though the end is somewhat of a disappointment. However, the body of the movie contains enough questions for a curious viewer to keep pondering long after the last name has rolled up across the screen.

Released in 2000, and written by the great Toby Emmerich, Frequency brings the mystical to the reality with its touching story. Bridging the gap between a deceased father and his forever effected son, we see a supernatural coincidence bring together a relationship that was ended far too soon. Frequency shows the depth that special bond of love between a father and son.The aurora Borealis, an old HAM radio, and love come together to allow a father and son in New York to communicate with each other; sounds refreshingly old fashioned and lovely until you add the fact that the father died years before. A family man and devout New York City firefighter, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) died in the line of duty when his son was a young boy. Our story takes place in the son's reality, 1999; a New York City police officer, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) forever reeling from the loss of the man he looked up to as a boy happens upon his father's old radio and plugs it in for a dose of nostalgia. Picking up a transmission, he communicates with the man on the other end. After putting the pieces together, John realizes that he is communicating with his father, in 1969, the night before the accident that takes his life. Desperate to have his father in his life, John convinces his dad of what is going on, and urges him to take different actions during the fire in hopes of saving his life. John's hope comes true, and his father takes different actions, only for the pair to realize that those actions create different circumstances, creating a new situation to overcome before the two can have the reunion they both want. Frequency explores the bond between father and son and shows that changing the past can produce grave circumstances.Jim Caviezel does an excellent job playing the part of a broken son who longs for the father that influenced him so much. You can see the yearning in the actor's eyes to be reunited with his dad. Dennis Quaid also plays his part well. There is a certain naivety essential for Quaid's character to pull off to make it believable; after all, you've got a guy on a hand-held radio telling you that he is from the future, and your son, when he's upstairs asleep. Quaid pulls off the endearing naiveté with ease, creating a character the audience wants to see succeed. The great chemistry between the actors, since it is largely centered on just the two men, makes Frequency an enjoyable film to visit again and again.No one event makes up the direction your life takes, and changing one event will have lasting impact on the rest of your life to come; these are the overarching themes I took away from Frequency. A great narrative to invite the audience to see the important of their pasts, and the effect of events of life on other life events, the film's message proves a positive one. It is uplifting for me to think that me and the events of my life are impactful to others and the events of their lives as well. The past is important, but no single event defines who we are, unless we let it, that is the lasting message of Frequency.

A lot of sci fi movies use the characters simply as vehicles to test drive the snazzy special effects and often end up lulling us into a coma. This one takes it's extremely minimal effects and uses them only to explore the relationships between characters as opposed to cheaply wowing us, and is a much richer film as a result of it. Hoblit has a few excellent thrillers under his belt (Primal Fear and Fallen come to mind) and even with those he never let the lofty concepts smother the character's growth or journey. Here, Dennis Quaid plays enthusiastic firefighter, loving husband and doting father Frank Sullivan, who lives in 1960's NYC with his kid and gorgeous wife (Elizabeth Mitchell). This film captures family love like no other, as we see through the actor's work that they really, really care about each other and would do anything to keep each other safe. Life throws a wrench in their idyllic lives, and decades later we join up with the adult version of Frank's kid, now a police detective and played by a burnt out, steely Jim Caviesel. He's haunted by the tragic way things turned out with his family. When his buddy gives him an old HAM radio, he absent-mindedly tinkers with it, until he reaches someone, who turns out to be his own father from back in the 60's, thanks to a solar storm of epic proportions that's turning the laws of time and space on earth inside out. It's far-fetched to be sure, but few films turn their beyond reality concepts into something as fun and grounded as this baby. Quaid and Caviesel, communicating across an impossible gulf of time and tragedy, work together to right the wrongs, discover the clues and transform the sad past they share into something more liveable. And we, the audience, are treated to a stellar sci fi/time travel flick that cares endlessly about its characters, aims to please and never ceases to entertain. With terrific supporting work from Andre Braugher, Shawn Doyle and Noah Emmerich, this is one I can watch on repeat and always be moved by its focused desire to tell a great story, and actors embodying the work flawlessly.

But it is done so very well!","Date":"2 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" There are others, but there are 2 film themes that come up over and over in films -- amnesia and time travel -- and almost never work. Amnesia only worked well in one film that I remember -- Ronald Colman's Random Harvest. Frequency is not about amnesia. It is about time travel. And this is that rare movie about time travel that actually works and is rather engrossing.One reason that this works is because they don't try to apply the theme to world-wide events. Instead, they focus on a father and his son over about 3 decades. The father a fire fighter, the son a policeman. As in common with such themes, every time the father and son intervene to change family history, unintended things also happen. So as they fix one thing, something else goes wrong, and then that needs to be fixed. And it all involves trying to solve some serial murders that happened years ago. And how do the father and son communicate over all those years -- the same ham radio that seems to derive special powers due to the aurora. A little far-fetched? Of course. But it works, and it works well. In fact, the way things happen is rather ingenious. And there are points where you may find yourself sitting on the edge of your chair.The father here is played by Dennis Quaid. Typically, I can take him or leave him. But he's very, very good here. The son is played by Jim Caviezel, who is equally as good as Quaid. Andre Braugher is a police detective who gets caught in the middle of a murder investigation that appears to incriminate his friend. Everyone else does their jobs, although none play parts big enough to deserve special mention.This film is done well enough that even though you realize the story is impractical, you find yourself thinking -- yes, that makes sense.

It has a very focused family element, especially in the form of fatherhood. The time travel element is also really nice. It has no real time travel since the the difference is only crossed by the radio chat between the characters. The movie treats the time travel element by keeping its mystery at the beginning but then take the focus away from the time travel mystery after the first history change with Frank not dying. Since then it's all about the fatherhood. The acting overall is quite good. Dennis Quaid played the father quite well that he expresses the right emotions on his scenes. Jim Caviezel played also quite well in expressing all those memory change.

It is sentimental but it asks you to check logic at the door. The latter film was infinitely better but I had a good time watching 'Frequency'.In 1969, Fireman Frank Sullivan is killed when he can't get out of a warehouse after rescuing a runaway girl. 30 years later in 1999 his son John is digging through a closet and finds dad's old ham radio. Playing around with it he suddenly hears a voice and at first doesn't realize that it is his father sitting there in 1969, actually the day before his death.Well, it's no big surprise to say that John gives his father information that will save his life. But that's just the beginning. A killer walks the streets and through a series of events that would not have happened if Frank had been killed, John's mother ends up the killer's next victim.This leads to a long series of developments in which John in 1999 tries to help Frank in 1969 repair the damage that they have done. Most movies would be happy to deal with just saving Frank from the accident. But Frequency comes up with all kinds of nice details. The ending reminded me of 'Back to the Future' in which a person helps their parents across time to not only change their future but improve it as well. The logic in the space time continuum has gaps big enough drive a firetruck through but that's doesn't matter. Time travel movies are never exact in their science.I smiled a good bit during this movie. The story is completely unbelievable (that much is obvious) but I appreciated it's determination to keep coming up with new twists. This was a movie that really tried to be inventive and I felt like I got my money's worth.

The film comes up with a new twist on the time travel theme - at least I had not seen it before. Thanks to some powerful solar flares and northern lights, a firefighter father and policeman son communicate instantaneously, sitting in the same house at the same table at the same HAM radio - but two decades apart. The screenwriters do not miss the poignancy of this father-son meeting through time, by making sure these characters did not get to communicate when the son was a child because of the father's (Dennis Quaid) untimely death.Or does he need to die? His son saves him from a fire he was fighting because to the son, it's old news. The repartee through the HAM radio and time is exquisite as the son must convince his father that he's from the future for real, not just a prankster, with just hours to go before his dad's death.A complicated story of unsolved mass murder ensues, drawing in friends and family past and present, who fade in and out of existence as the son alters the past by tipping off his father. After seeing it three times, the time travel plot is full of little holes, besides obvious ones, such as why the son would be the only one to remember the altered past, while everyone else's memories adapt to the past as it changes. Then there's the butterfly effect no way will a random mass murderer hit the same targets in same order once he's been messed up once. But the inconsistencies that are unavoidable in a time travel film are handled deftly by the writers, unlike, for example, the ridiculous premise of a recent Star Trek remake that an upset Romulan thrown into the past would rather blow up the planet of a man who almost saved the Romulan homeworld, instead of just trying the salvation procedure again, since he has 100 years to succeed!The film is well acted, the time spent developing the characters is interspersed with excellent action, from dangerous fires to life-threatening pursuit of a mass killer in the past and present. As a carefully set-designed period piece, the film holds up well, and is worth more than one viewing, if for no other reason than to see how the scriptwriters wrote around temporal paradoxes about as good as one can. For an almost perfect time paradox film, watch the Heinlein-based 'Predestination.' The SF grand-master knows how to circumvent every paradox.

A unique atmospheric anomaly allows New York City police officer John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) to contact his father, Frank (Dennis Quaid), a firefighter who died on the job 30 years ago. After preventing his father's death by instructing him to avoid it, John realizes that successfully manipulating past events is much trickier than he initially assumed.The film's appealing paranormal theme inevitably captures the viewer's attention, which is prolonged by Dennis Quaid's more-than-fine acting and Gregory Hoblit's discrete direction. Regrettably, these uplifting strengths are countered by a number of obvious shortcomings, such as the frustrating lack of continuity in the script, Elizabeth Mitchell's docile performance (as Julia Sullivan), and Michael Kamen's somewhat pretentious music score.Despite these shortcomings, however, 'Frequency' manages to retain its strong entertainment character and is enjoyable without becoming overwhelming. If anything, it contains one of the most original deaths of movie villains in recent memory, and no one can take that away from writer Toby Emmerich and the rest of the production crew. A fine attempt, 5.5 stars out of ten.

It's great science fiction in the tradition of the old Outer Limits series.  It really played like an extended Outer Limits or Twilight Zone show, with great character development, suspense and action.  It's also a good mystery!The plot revolves around strange sunspot activity which makes it possible for a NY City policeman to use a ham radio to talk to his father, a former NY City fireman who died 30 years previously in a fire.  Taking advantage of the opportunity, the son warns the father of his impending death and saves the man's life -- altering forever the future timeline in a strange and HORRIBLE way that the two race through the remaining two-thirds of the film to set right.The filmmakers try really hard to put current quantum physics explanations for what's going on into the film, using an interview with a physics professor with Dick Cavett on the tele in the background on night... it's subtle, yet obvious to the audience that their conversation has to do with the events unfolding in the narrative.  This of course anchors the film in the realm of science fiction rather than science fantasy or scifi, and gives it an air of suggestible believability that helps propel the plot foreward.It also has one of the most suspenseful and tense opening action sequences of any film I've seen in recent history -- a definite armrest grabber! Three solid stars for this entertaining and at times engaging film which at least attempts to deviate from the old cliche' of time travel plots, even if it fails in a few of those attempts.  It's not easily predictable, but once you get a taste for the director's methodology, you'll start figuring things out.  And the film's ending is a bit overly sentimental, with drawn out slo-mo sequences that border on the worst of the old Kodak special moments tv adverts.

While this movie worked on the father/son level, it completely falls apart in the science fiction realm. It commits the usual offense of incompetent time travel writers, where everything is purely subjective. In this case, anything changed 30 years ago doesn't show up for precisely 30 years and not one minute sooner. A message burned on a desk in 1969 is scrawled in real time in the future! Would it have been so difficult to have the son discover the complete message under some papers? And there's the old contrivance that the person changing the past somehow remembers how it was originally.I have to admit that Quaid and Caviezel did good work in their roles (except for Quaid's distractingly bad Bronx accent), but I really couldn't get past the plot problems when a movie takes itself so seriously.

I was skeptical at first but the plot drew me in and held me until the end.  Although it tries to straddle several genres, as it progresses it eventually boils down to a mystery/crime thriller.Nevertheless, I do dock some points from Frequency.  At times it was a little too cheesey.  Most of the 60's props looked more 90's to me.  I hardly noticed a difference at all between the two eras.  Maybe I'm too young to tell?The whole time-travel paradox was handled a bit sloppily, but really no worse than most time-travel movies.  On the other hand, it was probably a good thing that the movie didn't get bogged down trying to explain the physics behind the radio time-connection or the details of the time-paradox.  Rather they simply established that this radio communicates through time.  It's something to do with the stars; leave it at that.  If they tried to offer some lame, detailed explanation, it would have hurt the credibility more.  Overly picky critics may think themselves clever in pointing out the time-travel flaws in Frequency, but these are slips that the writers obviously knew about; it's assumed that the viewer will take a leap of faith fairly early on, and thus the movie is able to build an interesting plot from the premise of a magic radio.Consider on the other hand, the latest Star Wars flicks, where Lucas tries to explain the Force coming from tiny organisms in the bloodstream.  Bleeehh.  What a way to kill the magic and distract from the plot.All in all, Frequency is a fresh movie with an engrossing plot.  I give it a 7 / 10.

He was utterly believable; even when the plot became a bit far fetched, he treated it in such a manor as to enable the viewer to suspend disbelief, which must be the ultimate goal of any actor.

Upon seeing it on video, it quickly become one of my favorite movies. I am still kicking myself for not going to the theater to see it, adding to my regret that the movie did not do as good at the box office as it should have. Simply put, Frequency is a movie about second chances, regrets, justice, and reunion. Dennis Quaid, one of my favorite actors, puts in an outstanding performance as Frank Sullivan, fire-fighting baseball-lover extraordinaire, who dies in a warehouse fire in 1969, leaving his child and wife alone. Fast-forward thirty years- it's 1999, and Frank's son John is working for the NYPD as a detective. John and his partner come across the remains of a woman killed a little over thirty years ago in a series of slayings dubbed the Nightingale murders, as most of the victims were Nightingale nurses.As this discovery gives John a chance to close one element from the past, an odd appearance of the Northern Lights in N.Y. somehow messes with time, allowing John to communicate via shortwave radio with his dead father.From here, the two Sullivans hook up to stop the Nightingale killer across time, with results that must be experienced by the viewer. As Frank and John change past events, John's present becomes a combination of his real past, and the new one being made. But the question becomes- will John, being in the future, reach back and save his father from the fiery death that awaits him? With great acting, superb storytelling, and emotion galore, Frequency is a tale that draws you in and, while you suspend reality, grips you till its heart-stopping finale. Frequency proves that movies can still be magical.

And Frequency was no different. A decent story, some good acting, and what I thought was a better way of dealing with what happens in the present if you screw around with the past than most movies have dealt with before. Dennis Quaid (Frank) and James Caviezel (John) star as a father and son, the only difference being the father is in 1969 while the son is in 1999. It seems a solar flare up has allowed these two to talk to each other over an old ham radio. Whether or not you accept this possibility can go a long way to deciding whether or not you enjoy the movie. I accepted it and moved on. After a short period of non-belief, Frank comes to believe that this man he talks to really is his son in the future. But when John tells his father something that saves Frank's life, they also change the course of history. Now all of a sudden John's mother is murdered by a serial killer because of something Frank did differently in the past, and the two of them must rush to find the killer and save their family. The biggest problem with these types of movies, at least in my mind, is wondering how it's possible that if you change something in the past, the present is almost exactly the same. Other than in the Back to the Future movies (part 2 to be exact) where everything is different, in most time shifting movies, everything is generally the same, except for one or two minor changes. I always believed that if you changed something in the past, no matter how insignificant, the future would be changed in ways no one could imagine. I think The Simpsons had a good take on that in one of their Halloween episodes. Anyway, I just think that if someone was meant to die, if you change that and they live, then everything in the world would change. In this case it seems only memories change but not events. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)  For instance, and this isn't giving away too much, when Franks ends up not dying at a warehouse fire, John and his friends are still sitting in the same bar at the same time toasting his death. The only difference is now Frank dies of cancer 10 years earlier. Everyone's memory is of Frank dying of cancer, but the events of life are still exactly the same. Maybe I'm thinking too much. Anyway, while John's memories change, he also has the ability to remember both histories - the history with the changes in the past, and the history without the changes. I thought that was an interesting take on the subject. I thought the acting in the movie was good. Besides the two main characters, I really liked the mother (Elizabeth Mitchell) and I have always loved Andre Braugher who plays a cop who investigates the serial murders both in 1969 and still in 1999. I enjoyed the way the past and the present moved back and forth seamlessly, and I thought the story was pretty interesting. The main plot point that you need to accept, as I said earlier, is the ability for two people 30 years apart to be able to speak to each other. I think once you accept that, everything else become much easier to accept as well. "},{"Title":"What If this was the best movie of all time?

A few questions were not resolved about what happened and how it happened or even why it happened, but this did not detract from a very viewable, ultimately feel good movie. Movies like this restore one's faith that some people in Hollywood can reflect the values of this great country and its great people. The movie is a must for anyone growing up in the late 1960s, particularly baseball fans.  Finally, Frequency provides a tribute to the brave firefighters of New York City. Sadly, history cannot be changed, only written.

It has great acting, a good storyline, and good special effects. For instance, when they did the Northeren Lights, that's exactly what they look like. Jim Caviezel is extraordinary in this movie. I've never seen him in any other movies though. Currently this is in my top ten movies along with many others such as Jurassic Park, The Patriot, Rudy, Bad Boys, etc. But I'm here to talk about Frequency.   Dennis Quaid was a firefighter in 1969. He eventually dies in a fire in 1969. For thirty years it haunted his son's life John O'Sullivan (Jim Caviezel). Almost thirty years from the day his father died, he discovers a radio that his dad used to talk on around the world (kind of like instant messaging, but you're not typing). John and his friend Gordo set it up to see if it still worked. It worked more than they thought it would. Later in the night, John hears a voice coming from the radio. Both people say wierd stuff to each other and they soon find out, there father and son. John was talking to his dad before he died thirty years ago. John discovers that he can change history with the radio and saves his dad from the fire that he died in. But things get worse. Because of John saving his dad his mother dies. In the movie you'll see why. I can't give it away.  Overall this is a great movie and I strongly recommend it. It's a must see! Great story. Warning You have to pay attention to the movie or you won't understand it. I had to watch the movie twice to get it right.  One person also said before that they didn't like it because to much history was changed and John should of discovered what an acholoic mess he was. It wouldn't have been a movie, if it was like that. It would of been downright boring and there would have been no suspense. It was supposed to be that way. Frequency gets a 10/10.

Why isn't this on the Top 250? I think it's high enough...If you don't read the plot, here's a summary John Sullivan, a detective working on a case 30 years old finds his late dad's old ham radio. (Well, his friends son really found it, but John uses it most of the time.) He communicates with someone on the radio who doesn't know how the 1969 Baseball Tournament (or whatever it is) went, even though it's 1999.In reality, the person is John's dead dad, in 1969. When John finds this out, he warns Frank (his dad) that he will die in a fire. When he sees that what hes saying is right, he goes another way in the fire, saving a teenage girl as well as himself.(Minor spoilers coming up)This doesn't work as well as you'd expect-Frank died in 1989 from cancer anyway-but he gets his dad to live longer. The only side effect is that his mother was killed in the case hes investigating, and 9 other nurses were killed too (originally three, without his mom).This makes Frank go in to save the 7 remaining nurses. There, you have to stop reading this summary and watch the film yourself to find what happens.My only problem is (MAJOR SPOILER) the all-too-happy ending. Having Frank live longer than in the rest of the film and killing the killer is just too happy for a film where deaths of family members of the hero are plot points.But other than that, it is one of the greatest films. And get it higher on the list (maybe someone will have told people to see this in the past and it got on the 250), it deserves to from #15-100.

Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre Braugher and Elizabeth Mitchell star in this magical journey that will leave each member of the viewing audience in awe and breathless.Frequency joins Men Of Honor, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan and Finding Forrester as my five of my favorite films, which deserve the title of masterpiece. My reasons for making this statement are the unique concept of the film, superb writing and strong performances.Congratulations to the writers for creating one of the richest scripts brought to screen since Titanic. I kept smiling throughout this film because it explored the unbreakable bond father and son share with one another. I knew Frequency would become a powerful and special film as soon as I saw the trailer for the first time. I was in awe and shock when Frequency was left off the academy award ballot.Frequency is laced with storylines that would put light in a dark room and brighten anyone's dark days. Frequency is laced with intense, adrenaline pumping action with edge of your seat suspense, excitement and drama. This unique film ranks in the top ten movies I've seen all year. Frequency is a unique film that will never be made again and if the chance arose this type of film is made; it will never measure up to the greatness of this film.Quaid, Caviezel, Mitchell and Braugher come together to bring one of the finest films to life. In the spirit of Ghost, Frequency is an epic story about father and son who reunite over the ham radio 30 years after Frank's death. However, throughout their conversations, they unintentionally alter the past and become thrust into a serial murder investigation. The cast support Frequency receives is powerful and rich.Quaid is a brilliant actor, who has proven to audiences across the United States he will give 110 percent in each performance he gives and the result will be satisfaction. Frequency is the latest in a long string of films that keeps me in shock and asking the question why he hasn't had the opportunity to win academy awards because his performances have been very deserving.Caviezel's resume may not be high in quantity but it is high in quality, yet he is a tremendous asset to each film he stars in. Caviezel may not be a Hollywood veteran quite yet; but with his charisma, screen presence, integrity and intensity he deserves the title of veteran.Braugher provides great support in his role as Caviezel's partner and Quaid's friend in Frequency. I have always enjoyed Braugher from his role on the series, Homicide Life On The Street because his presence is felt with each scene was in; a fact that holds true in every film he is in. I look forward to each film he is in because like Quaid he gives 110 percent. One thing I enjoy about watching Braugher act is receiving the knowledge I will be getting an honest and intense performance. He is an actor that will hold nothing back and give the role everything he has.Mitchell is a welcome addition to Hollywood as she is one of the brightest young actresses in film. I enjoyed watching Mitchell because she had a glow about her that is missing from other actresses. I can't wait to see her rise to stardom and be able to look back and say 'I knew with her role in `Frequency,' Elizabeth Mitchell would become a huge star.'I have consistently said music and soundtracks are one of the most powerful selling points of a film. From Trisha Yearwood's rendition of 'How Do I Live' for Con Air to Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' in Titanic comes a song so powerful and touching it will leave you in tears. Garth Brooks rendition of 'When You Come Back To Me Again' put icing on the cake and made me watch this film. Upon listening to this song, everyone will get a sense of what this movie is about. This is one the top five soundtrack songs that I've heard in my life because it is the perfect companion to an already perfect movie.Only one word comes to mind when describing my overall feeling of this film EXCELLENCE. Every part of Frequency is excellent. From the powerful and moving performances to the edge of your seat drama, Frequency will delight and amaze every viewer. It is my honor to let everyone know Frequency is one of the best films of 2000. I have seen Frequency so many times I've stopped counting after 10. Frequency is an A+ in my book.

It goes far further into the changing the past and future issue than anything previous, from 'The Time Machine' to 'Back To The Future', problems with The Sixth Sense were stuff like, how could he go on not realising he was dead and how could a tape recorder pick up the voice of a ghost that only rare people can hear, there's more than that, see my comments page, in Frequency, right from the point of keeping his father from dying in the fire, nothing in the family or among his friends or in the newspapers or anything like that would be the same, the changes would result in, as Doc Brown would say 'a meltdown of the space-time continuun', the main characters then cause some more deaths and save some more lives and bring more people into the change rage, this movie takes the serious type of realism from TSS and mixes it with the Back To The Future sort of narrative, the result if you can look past as above is a fun always surprising and intriguing film. SYNOPSISOne night after a low point in a young cops life he and a 'womb to tomb' friend of his get out a 30 year old radio and when by himself, the cop tunes in to someone who he starts a conversation with, like father like son they discuss Baseball and work, it's after the cops correct prediction of a baseball game that they lose thier contact due to interference, in the conversation a little confusion around who they are leaves them both in wonder about the following day. A fire comes in a place the young guy predicted and Dennis Quaid is edgey, it comes down to another prediction and Quaid manages to do the opposite to what history previously had him do.....and lives to see the close of the day. The movie becomes paced by thier nightly tune ins and chats. It comes out that a dads visit to a hospital causes more serial killings, the kid is the only one who realises changes in 99 everyone else changes appropriately. The pair start working together to prevent the killings in the town, but it escalates when the dad meets the killer.CRITIQUETo go into the movie you should justly know no more than that. The ending becomes pretty complicated and if you can try just to keep your eyes on the road you should not have too many problems, dont think too much about the branches in the story. This movie would still be good after the first time. Just think of it as Back To The Future meets Backdraft, you will also recognise the female-targetting serial killer idea from Silence Of The Lambs.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Interesting sci-fi/drama","Date":"16 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Frequency is a sci-fi/drama with an intriguing premise.

There are spectacular moments (e.g. the opening 5 min.), the acting is convincing (Quaid has never been better) and there are magical special effects which service the story rather than to overblow it. There are some excellent time travelling tricks and the relationship between father and son is illuminating, even more  because this sort of thing doesn't happen too often in modern Hollywood.There are flaws, too. Jim Caviezel delivers a turn of unsurpassed uselessness, neither sympathetic nor emotional in a not-so delicate part.The ending is terrible. If you've got the feeling the movie is over, better turn the tv off, so you won't have to face the most fake, stupid, offensive and downright implausible conclusions in years.If you don't think too hard, and don't feel time-travelling is necessarily unacceptable, you will have a great time. Don't expect to see a realistic adventure, because you will be disappointed.*** "},{"Title":"A Wonderful Film (Recommend It To Your Father)","Date":"6 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Ok, so there are a few holes in the plot.

He is good in all parts and should have gotten an Oscar many times by now. I think that Hollywood is against really handsome man.  Besides that Dennis in an independent person. He does not even have an agent! Good for you Dennis. Don't have to sit and wait for phone calls.  There is a lot of politics in Hollywood.  I loved Dennis and Meg Ryan. I don't like to get involved in people's personal life,   I have  tried in my own way to be fair, I will watch one Dennis Quaid movie and then one Med Ryan movie right away not to show partiality. As if their divorce was any on my business. I have had such a hard time with their split. That I just can not begin to tell. I have them around my house all the time, as I have purchased almost all of their movies, both of them. I just wish that this whole entire thing was not true. O my!  But back to the movie. It blew my mind! BIG TIME!  I expected one of those movies that one is dead  and talks to the person who is lived.  But I was so wrong. I will get a Dennis Quaid movie, even if he sits there and does nothing. What a PRESENCE! What a nice guy!  The movie is so exciting, and full of nuances.

FREQUENCY makes these chances possible. But what if we made something worse? Could we still make it right?Despite what you may have heard, FREQUENCY is _not_ a movie about time travel. There are no Deloreans, no Terminators, and certainly no Van Dammes. All you need is a radio and a leap of faith. FREQUENCY is about making changes, and the consequences that follow.

Toby Emmerich's story takes a fresh approach to the time travel angle.  Rather than having people traveling through time, Emmerich has them communicating through time using a Ham Radio that has been augmented by an Aurora Borealis.  Ok, there aren't many Aurora Borealis events as far south as New York City, but there isn't any trans-time communication noted in the scientific literature either, so we need to allow the story a little latitude.After we accept the premise, this ingenious plot incorporates many different elements to entice the viewer.  There is the human angle of a son speaking to his dead father, the many twists resulting from altering the ribbon of time, and the solving of a thirty-year-old serial murder case.  The various elements are combined effectively by director Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, Fallen) to produce a fast paced action thriller with sufficient character development to bind us emotionally to the characters.  The fascinating thing about the detective story is that the facts of the crime keep changing in unexpected ways each time John (James Caviezel) imparts something to his father (Dennis Quaid) that causes him to change history.  In addition, the action sequences are well done and the visual effects, especially the digitized Aurora are nicely rendered.  The aging makeup is also realistic.The acting was excellent as well, though the New York accents were pretty bad.  Dennis Quaid alternated between the goofy and endearing dad and the action hero, and managed to keep it from seeming incongruous.  This was a breakout performance by James Caviezel, who heretofore has been confined to minor roles.  His was a very emotional and tense role and he handled it extremely well.  I was also impressed with Elizabeth Mitchell who gave a vivacious performance as John's mother.I enjoy a good intelligent science fiction thriller.  Lately, science fiction has been subsumed into the horror category, since you seldom see a science fiction story that isn't an excuse to hack up some cast members.  This film was more in the tradition of Twilight Zone, relying more on an inventive story than grisly effects to capture the audience.  That's why I rated this film a 9/10.  With luck, this will inspire a return to more creative science fiction. "},{"Title":"Suspenseful and exciting!","Date":"13 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Tense.

Written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, the film stars Dennis Quaid as a New York firefighter in 1969 who manages, through some fluke of nature, to contact his very own son, Johnny (Jim Caviezel), via short wave radio, thirty years in the future.   The filmmakers manage to come up with a surprisingly large number of narrative twists and turns to keep this potentially one-note premise intriguing and interesting as father and son come to know each other across the normally uncrossable chasm of time.   For instance, Johnny not only has to try to reverse history and prevent his father's untimely death in a fire in 1969, but also to thwart the murders of his mother and of several other women by a serial killer during that same time period.A film like `Frequency' really doesn't have much going for it but the ingenuity of its plot.  Whenever it tries to get meaningful and touching, particularly in its exploration of the father/son relationship, the film dissolves in a puddle of hopelessly contrived and manufactured sentimentality.  On the other hand, `Frequency' does manage to keep to a minimum the maddening inconsistencies and lapses in logic that invariably accompany these time-bending scenarios.  Moreover, the filmmakers make clever use of the famous 1969 World Series, astutely finding ways to incorporate it into the fabric of the drama.  On a trivial level, the film does seem to suffer from an apparent oversight on the part of its makers.  The movie is supposed to be set in New York City in the Octobers of 1969 and 1999 &#150; yet, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't at least some of the trees be turning colors and dropping leaves by that time?  As far as we can tell, the movie seems to have been filmed during the summer months.  For a film whose very foundation is to question the very nature of time, this seemingly insignificant error looms larger than it perhaps otherwise might.A film of this sort really doesn't stand up to too close scrutiny.  A viewer either accepts the incredibility of the premise and goes with it, or rejects the concept out of hand and moves on to another film.  Suffice it to say then that, given its fundamental plot-is-everything nature, `Frequency' makes for reasonably diverting and absorbing viewing.

"},{"Title":"Frequency is a great movie, very novel premise, keeps you on the edge until the very end.","Date":"8 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Frequency has a very novel premise - an unusually high Northern Lights activity allows a deceased father (Dennis Quaid) and adult son, a murder investigator, to communicate directly with each other during October 1969 and October 1999 through the ham radio that is simultaneously in the possession of each!  Of course no one really believes this can happen, so to enjoy and appreciate this film you have to suspend belief and enjoy the what if. Sort of like you had to do for Back to the Future or, more recently, for Being John Malkovich.But that's not all. As father and son fully realise what is happening, the way they use information begins to change the past, and some times in very unexpected ways. And that is really where the movie takes off, and to me, becomes one of the more interesting movies and well-done that I've seen. I don't quite think it is a 10, but I rate it a strong 9. After the movie was over, we had to go back and re-watch some scenes to get the full impact, and here DVD is a great benefit.And, while I am on the subject, DVD picture and sound quality are fine, but nothing outstanding. The extras are pretty good, with a couple of different commentary tracks you can choose. The most interesting is a scientific presentation regarding solar activity, the 10-year cycles, how that affects the Earth's magnetic fields and northern lights, and how that can affect communications, like ham radios. Much of what is depicted in the film is based on good science.CAUTION - SPOILERS FOLLOW.When the father, a firefighter, realises he is to die during a rescue due to happen in two days, he changes his escape path from the burning building, and he and the child both survive. However, he is a heavy smoker, and dies of cancer 20 years later. However, all that sets into motion a series of cause/effect incidents.  Like, instead of being at his wake the next day, his wife is at work as a nurse where she prevents a man from dying from a medical mistake. The man turns out to be a serial Nightingale killer who had killed 3 nurses before he died. Now that he survived, he ends up killing 7 more, including the fireman's wife, and the killer's own mother. The latter revelation turns out to be the key to realising who he was.  So, they have to work to re-change history, now that they know they can!  It gets very complicated!The gimmick they use to convince each other, and eventually a cop, that this time conversation is real, is the 1969 baseball world series where the Mets won. The son in 1999 told them exactly how the game the next day in 1969 would be won, and when they saw it on TV knew it was real.Remember in Back to the Future, when it appeared the son would not be able to get his mom and dad together at the dance, the images of the kids (in the future photo) started to fade away?  They used a similar technique here, where after something in the past was changed, then the scrapbook of newspaper clippings would change.  Or, photographs would change, to show different sets of people. There is no perfect way to do all this, since it is fantasy anyway, but it is done very effectively here.The final climax, which strikes much more terror than the Blair Witch Project ever did, is where the killer is both in the past (young) and the present (old) at the same time, trying to kill the mother (which he presumably had done) in 1969 and the son in 1999, while the ham radio was activated, so while we watched, they could hear across 30 years what was going on in the house, the same house! While the killer is choking the son in 1999, the father in 1969 blows off the killer's hand.  The killer runs out the door, the mother is alive, and as the killer is choking the son in 1999, his hand gradually disappears.  Looking shocked the killer backs away and a shotgun is leveled at him, and boom he is gone, snuffed out by the elder father in 1999 who, during a late scene, had given up smoking, and did not die of cancer after all!Re-reading all this, sounds a bit hokey, but seeing it on film, it really works. The acting and directing are good, as are the several special effects, and the film keeps your attention like very few do.  That is why it gets such a high rating from me, the very novel concept of time conversation instead of time travel, and the thrilling way the stories and their changes were handled.

Take Back to the Future, for example. A space-time continuum? Gigawatts? A time machine made out of a Delorean? But what unites that film with a movie like Frequency is that if you change one thing in the past, the consequences spilling from that action could be dire indeed.Dennis Quaid is Frank Sullivan, a firefighter in 1969 New York. The Amazin' Mets are in the World Series and he has a loving wife and son. At the other end of our time spectrum is John Sullivan, a cop in 1999 New York. John is Frank's son. Finding his late father's old ham radio in a hall closet, John turns it on and happens to find himself talking to his long-dead father. How long? Frank died in 1969, right around the time of the World Series, in a warehouse fire. Amazin', isn't it?The primary event that sets off all of the other events is the saving of Frank's life - he's supposed to have died in the warehouse fire, but John tells him about it ahead of time. Frank lives, and now all changes. And, of course, the only two people who can tell the difference are Frank and John themselves. This is a standard plot device, although I'm sure it would also be the case in real life. It's where No One Believes the Hero. Just once, I'd like to see Our Hero explain to the Authorities that he was abducted by aliens, they seemed nice but aloof at first, but now they're headed right this way -- and then have the Authorities say, Wow, we better get ready for them! Set my phaser on kill! But that doesn't happen. The Men in Charge never seem to believe Our Heroes, no matter how logical they may make the situation seem. Frank, of course, tries to convince his old buddy Satch (Andre Braugher) that a killer on the loose is not him (Frank, that is) and that the real killer is... someone else. But will Satch hear of it? Heck, no! Even when Frank tries to tell him how the '69 World Series will wind up (thus injecting logic where logic cannot exist; but remember, movies are the vacuums of logic, even the ones that don't suck), Satch merely gets mean and nasty and forgets he's Frank's pal.But this is a wonderful story, no doubt about it. There are some very well-done scenes, both thoughtful and thought-provoking. The writers obviously didn't want to take the easy way out and use movie logic all the time. The bottom line is that the effects are very nicely done (and even better on DVD) and the plot itself is tight. Don't wear yourself out looking for loopholes; just be content to be fascinated by this surprisingly mesmerizing movie.

John Sullivan (played by Jim Caviezal) is a modern-day New York cop whose life is falling apart.  He drinks heavily, smokes even more and his girlfriend has walked out on him.  Sullivan's father, Frank (Dennis Quaid) was a firefighter who died in a blaze exactly 30 years ago, when John was only six years old. John discovers his father's old short wave radio, and through an atmospheric quirk is able to talk with his father the day before he is `scheduled' to die in a warehouse fire.  John takes action, but the result is the first of two major themes  Our actions can have unintended-and often tragic-consequences.   And as father and son begin to connect via the short wave, the second theme emerges The devastating effect the absence of a parent can have on a child, even as the child passes into adulthood.

Even to the point of where I'd call it one of the best movies not-really-about-time-travel ever.Caviezel play an NY cop who's never really been able to get over the death of his dad Quaid, a firefighter who died 30 years before in the line of duty.  One day, for no particular reason, Caviezel digs out his dad's old ham radio (he lives in his dad's old house), and through some astral miracle, is able to communicate with his father in the past.  He sets out to see if he can't save his father's life.The problem with this movie (and the problem with all time travel movies) is the the temporal logic is all wrong.  If something gets changed in the past, it doesn't just change before your eyes in the present, and you wouldn't have any knowledge of the change  it would just always be like that, because the change happened in the past.  Not the case here, where everyone takes whatever happened in the past as fact, where as Caviezel can remember how things in the past got changed.  Things that happen in the past also affect the future in real time (a person writing on a desk in the past would look like an invisible hand writing on that same desk at that same instant in the present).  But this doesn't ruin the movie; there are a lot of good things going on.  The screenplay is smart enough not to just be about John saving his dad  once his dad is saved, it causes other problems to arise in the present which Quaid must fix in the past.  I also like the initial conversations between Caviezel and Quaid, where they don't talk about what needs to be done to save dad, but what's been going on in the past 30 years.  The pacing's good, the action's good, and the ending made everyone in the theater cheer.

If you suspend your imagination and immerse yourself in the fanciful mysticism of the Northern-Lights-induced-time-travel theory, you will find yourself utterly absorbed and strangely moved by the tale of father and son crossing the time and mortality barriers.The dialogue between Sullivan Jnr and Snr sparkles with a nicely realistic &#145;male bonding' feel and genuinely moving chemistry between the two lead players.Dennis Quaid &#150; his face weathering into character like a well-seasoned baseball mitt &#150; has rarely been better as Frank Sullivan, the fire-man turned cross-dimensional crime-fighter.  Good to see that he is stepping out of the shadow of being Mr Meg Ryan and becoming a star in his own right once again.And Jim Caviezel shows exactly why Terence Mallick cast the then virtually unknown actor in The Thin Red Line.  Initally mournful and falling into macho hard-drinking cop stereotype, Caviezel injects subtlety and humanity into the role of John Sullivan.  Blessed with the most expressive pair of blue eyes, Caviezel portrays loss, pain and joy without having to say a word.But after all these original and inventive ingredients, what should rate as a wonderful film deflates like a cheap balloon in the very last scene.One can only hope that Mr Hoblit will release a secret directors cut of this without the shocking ending.  What could have been his Field of Dreams turns into a bit of a nightmare.So overall, there are two ratings for this movie First 90 minutes=  9/10 Last five= -3It's about time Hollywood learned that its audience is lactose intolerant and simply cannot stomach any more cheddar-rich finales.

And the even more crazy thing is that I really liked it!  What we have is some kind of Twilight Zone episode given the movie treatment. Some nice colouful looking solar activity allows a mourning cop (Caviezel) to be able to speak to his dead father (Quaid), via an old ham radio that links the years 1999 and 1969. This out of the ordinary opportunity gives the son a chance to save his fathers life, who died in a fire fighting accident, by telling him how to avoid his death. But changing the past has its consequences for the future&#133; something, which nether are prepared for.  After an explosive opening sequence the film has a nice mix of family bonding with father and son (all that baseball and bike riding), science fiction spookiness all to do with the unusual time element, plus there's the added bonus of a crime story to do with a serial killer. It does put the film at a bit of a loss though, as it can't seem to decide what category it wants to fit into. But still, I think it all fits perfectly!  There are reasonable performances from everyone, some lush special effects and some edge of your seat fire fighting scenes! But it is the unique yet absurd story that I think keeps this movie going. Unfortunately this has one of those feel good endings full of sentiment designed to leave you smiling when you leave the cinema but it does seem to let the whole thing down.  It's very clever with its time warp story and doesn't give in to many noticeable goofs. It's emotional family bonding and scary serial killer scenes also show that this film does have a little of everything to cater for everyone.

You feel like you're experiencing what the characters are experiencing and understand what they are going through.  And, unlike other movies, there is not just one problem to be resolved.  The plot is complex, but not overly so, just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. In fact, the climax draws you in so much, my best friend and I did not let go of each other's hands during the whole scene.The acting is also excellent.  Dennis Quaid did a wonderful job, one of his best performances yet, I thought.  His New York accent was right on the mark, as well as his portrayal of his character, Frank Sullivan.  James Caviezel and Elizabeth Mitchell also had outstanding performances.The filming was superb.  There are several scenes that take place in both time periods.  They keep flashing back and forth between the two creating a suspenseful feeling.  The climax was especially suspenseful.  It is shot in both 1969 and 1999 and is done so exceptionally that it's just amazing to watch.Finally, there is a little bit of everything in this movie, to keep everyone happy.  There are some major fire stunts, a bit of romance, teary emotional father-son scenes, a few really great comedy lines, a chase, an underwater struggle, a grasping-for-the-gun fight scene, and, most of all, major suspense.

Is it just script choices, dumb luck, or is it who you know? Haven't seen all his movies, but, out of the 24 he's made since then, I saw eight. Anyway, you pretty much know what to expect. He's not exactly a chameleon, the camera really likes him, and he's a working movie actor with a genuine career, though I haven't quite been able to figure out exactly why. I would never ever pay to watch him stand around drinking beer, like I would Russell Crowe or Gary Oldman, but I have to admit that sometimes he comes through. Frequency is one of his times. Even as the plot turns to Swiss cheese, at least the actors believe it and give solid performances. You can always count on Quaid if the part calls for a grown man who never grew up. He plays a loving father and husband, a hard-working fireman in Queens, NY, and `a big kid.'The story is tricky, to say the least. There must have been a Twilight Zone episode similar to it. Though the movie doesn't start there, the first thing to accept, is that a young homicide detective, John Sullivan (James Caviezel), has lived in the same house for all 36 years of his life. Mom moved out, but, he's still there. Okay. Second, because of abnormal atmospheric conditions in October 1969 and October 1999, radio signals get bounced all over outer space, and John starts talking to his own father (Quaid) on the same ham radio set reaching 30 years into the past - just days before fire-fighter Dad dies in the line of duty. All right. They share information that changes the past, present and future. Of course, everybody knows that when you do that sort of thing bad things happen, too. So, you have to fix the mess you created. If you change one thing in the past, all the possible futures change, too. Don't think too hard about it, or you'll get a  headache. You just have to watch the movie and not ask too many questions, especially in the last 30 minutes. They end up trying to stop a serial killer and trying to keep the family together. Dad is in danger. Mom's in danger. Nurses are in danger. Hey, mom's a nurse! Everybody's in trouble but the killer. He just keeps at it, whoever he is.Besides fire-fighters, the rest of the characters are cops, neighbors, and best friends, and everybody really loves baseball. That was back when it was still a game, the Mets won the World Series, and soccer moms hadn't been invented yet. We played baseball every chance we got. It unified us. It was so American, and our love for it was passionate, innocent and pure. That's another thing they make movies about.The heart of the story, besides what we'd do if we had a magic ham radio, is the relationship between a father and son. The male bonding that never happened before happens on the radio and we feel their closeness. The value of family is the main message. What if your father died when you were six years old, but as an adult, you could ignore time and call him on the phone back when he was alive? I guess we've all had dreams of going back into the past somewhere, sometime, somehow. I know I have. Ever since before the days of H.G.Wells we've liked stories about people who cheat time because we never will. What's the best reason to do it? No, not baseball. Family. Most of us have families. Don't we want everybody's family to be happy? The script keeps the family as the most important thing. The nearest and dearest thing. The main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.

I have a little news for people like that...it's just a movie, and a pretty darn good one at that.  I never really got caught up in the idea of whether or not certain things could have happened, I mean why would I when the entire idea was unrealistic.  What I did like was the fact that this movie covered a very touching subject.  Anyone who has lost a loved one knows how wonderful it would be if they could just talk to that person one more time.  This movie illustrated that idea in a very powerful way.  And who cares if the ending was all wrapped up nice and neat.  I am not against sad endings.  In fact I believe some movies have to have them (especially if they are true stories such as Boys Don't Cry).  However, in a movie like this, the nice neat happy ending suited me just fine.

Frequency seems to have generated so many warm, fuzzy feelings among movie reviewers and imdb commentators alike, I wonder if I was just having a bad hair day or something.  It wasn't a horrible flick, but kinda like a TV movie, as they say.  Chock full of cliches, cinematic rip-offs, poor writing, uninspiring sets.  I knew I was in trouble from the opening sequence, which is a blatant pillaging of the magnificent astronomical overture to the movie Contact.  (Perhaps not coincidently, Contact is another movie about a kid who loses a father and knows how to use a ham radio.)  A lot of the story just seemed kind of thrown-together, with no attention to detail or authenticity.  For instance, a detective supervises the exhumation of a skeleton by waving his hand and saying, Be careful with the bones, and keep some of the dirt around them.  I assume the New York Police Department has trained experts who follow a careful procedure for such things.  Or take the scene where Quaid's character spontaneously and effortlessly uses a credit card to break into an apartment.  How does this softball-playing family man happen to know how to pick a lock with a credit card, especially the lock of a New York City apartment?  Couldn't it have been more realistic, and just as dramatic, if he had been frantically buzzing the downstairs bell and pounding on the front door of the building (which would allow him to leave fingerprints and be seen by neighbors), and then run upstairs to find the apartment door unlocked?  It's as if the writer, realizing the overall plot was so goofy to begin with, couldn't be bothered with little touches that would add to credibility.  Other stuff was irritating, like when Caviezel's character, with complete confidence and without explanation, says that a particular woman was the first victim of a serial killer, so she knew the killer.  Apparently, the viewer is expected to be familiar with Silence of the Lambs (or its hundreds of imitators) and with this fact about serial killers.  The sentimental family sequences at the beginning and end were artificial and unoriginal--mom dancing to the radio as she cooks, parents smooching while the kid watches fondly, people spraying each other with the garden hose while washing the car (please! not that one!), etc.  Like I said, it wasn't a bad film.  Some of the time-travel stuff was pretty neat, and when I realized where they were going with the cigarette theme, it almost brought a tear to my eye.  If it weren't for the disturbing glimpses of some nasty crime scenes, I'd even say it could be a good kids' film.  But it could have been a whole lot better if the writer had tried for more originality.

Once you accept the premise that two people can talk across a 30-year gap in time due to sunspot activity (and kudos to the producers for providing continuity across the years via real science guy Brian Greene), the rest of the film flows quite naturally from this device.  I would also say that this is probably an ideal date flick -- a little something for everyone, including an opportunity for guys to show their sensitive sides to their girlfriends, while at the same time providing enough action and excitement to qualify as a typical guy flick.

The execution of the idea was disappointing in my opinion, though I'll admit that my opinion seems to be in the minority here.  While the story was promising I found myself distracted by many glaring plot holes that always seem to come up in time travel movies.  The whole way they dealt with the time issue bothered me, especially in respect to John.***Spoilers Ahead! Skip if you don't want some plot revealed!***Why does John remember the past in which his father died?  In theory, if he were to save his father's life like he did in the movie, everything in his life would then be different from that day on.  And while John did gain all these new memories, he still kept the old ones.  No other character remembers this alternate reality but for reasons left unexplained, John does.  Granted, the movie wouldn't work if he lost all the memories but it bothered me that they didn't even try to explain it.Another thing that bothered me was things taking place simultaneously in the past and the present.  If Frank carved something into a desk in 1969, John shouldn't be able to see the letters being formed in the desk in 1999. They should have been there for the last 30 years of his life.  Same thing with the Nightengale Killer's hand.  It wouldn't suddenly disappear in the present, it would have been gone for 30 years.While I'm on the subject, isn't it amazing that the Killer was able to stay on the lamb for 30 years and then returned to attack John in his house? Never mind the fact that their conversation at the bar should never have taken place.What exactly in the past influenced John's relationship with Samantha?  In the original present they have just separated, then she doesn't hardly know him, then they have kids together?  What???***End of Spoiler***Basically, the problem for me was that the movie sometimes approached the two times as if they were occurring at the same time, when things should be happening 30 years apart from one another.

You'll need to accept the space-time continuum fantasy plotline (and Dennis Quaid's Queens accent) to enjoy the film, but you'll enjoy it. Halfway through the film, my box of nachos hit the sticky floor of the theater. Luckily, the box was empty.The film is filled with great performances, especially Quaid (yes, regardless of the accent, his performance was more than convincing) as Frank Sullivan, the firefighting father of John Sullivan (Caviezel of The Thin Red Line). Frank is killed in a warehouse fire in 1969, and in 1999 John, now a cop, finds his father's old ham radio and discovers that the man he meets on the radio is his own father in the past. This story is kind of farfetched, but it's fantasy (millions of us have accepted Star Wars and Star Trek--why not accept this?), and the moviemakers pull it off well. John convinces his father, through predictions in the 1969 Amazin' Mets World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, that he is in fact John Sullivan of the 1990s, and Frank survives the warehouse fire in a scene that expertly captures the mood of the audience--suspense mixed with a need for visual splendor, as director Gregory Hoblit (Fallen) cuts back and forth between 1999 and 1969. Of course, changing the past changes the future.From there, the movie becomes a police thriller, as a 30-year-old murder case is reopened. This is the plotline that'll make you want to see the movie twice. It's all there in the first half of the film; you just don't see it until the second half. I won't spoil it for you, but it was a well-written plotline and very interesting.I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy movies. I was also especially pleased to see Andre Braugher as a veteran homicide detective. Those of us who watched Homicide Life on the Street loved Braugher as Baltimore Homicide detective Frank Pembleton, a role which won him an Emmy. Elizabeth Mitchell also caught my attention, as Julia Sullivan, Frank's wife and John's mother. One thing I must point out--and which you'll notice--is when, in the second half of the film, something happens that moves the focus from 1999, where most of the action had been taking place, to 1969, and John (in 1999) is left helpless to save the fate of all those in his past. Some great moments in the second half that never seem too detached from the first half.For those of you psyched up to see the film, leave your expectations at the door and enjoy the ride. Though overly sentimental at times, it's a great film that you'll really love. Maybe you won't be clumsy and spill your empty box of nachos like I did, but you'll be too caught up in the moment to care.

The movie is one of the several that mark the return of the supernatural thriller (though the genre was never very strong in the first place), recent examples include 'The Sixth Sense', 'Stigmata' and 'Stir of Echoes'.	The film is directed by Gregory Hoblit ('Primal Fear'). Though I absolutely despised 'Fear', and would've never seen 'Frequency' if I knew he helmed it, he displays real talent here, and manages to cover up the implausibilities in it, where many other directors would've failed.	The performances from Jim Caviezel ('The Thin Red Line') and Dennis Quaid (Switchback') are wonderfully natural, possibly the best in their careers. Though they are only on screen together for about thirty seconds in the 127 minute long flick, they display excellent chemistry throughout the picture. The performances by the relatively unknown supporting cast (including 'The Truman Show's Noah Emmerich) are also remarkable, strengthening the film.	Likely the main reason why 'Frequency' is tanking at the box office is because of the lack of star power. Neither Caviezel or Quaid have the power to draw substantial crowds (neither of them have been in a major hit), and the film suffers greatly because of that. See it anyway, you'll be extremely glad you did.9/10 "},{"Title":"Wow!","Date":"9 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  First off, this movie makes you think.  It makes you look at the details. If you don't you will see plot holes because you don't understand.  The whole plot is wrapped up in the String Theory, but it doesn't bore you with details, Brian Green (the guy with Dick Cavette) is a String Theorist at Columbia University. He basically tells you that given this current theory of the universe, time travel is possible, but enormous energy is needed. Enter the solar flares in both dimensions.  Their effect upon the earth is to excite the aurora, but their effect on the universe is to open a gateway between the past and future.  We see first hand that time is not linear, that at least for now it is parallel. AS something occurs in the past, it effects the present, and the present can effect the past. The communications between the father and the son are not truly radio waves, the are made possible by the same radio, in the same place at the same time under the same conditions.   Enough of the explanation of how it works.  It works! Based in the science of the day.  For those who come expected a sci-fi extravaganza, sorry.  For those who come looking for a murder mystery, sorry. But for those who come looking for a movie that challenges you, makes you feel good and makes you go WOW! this is it!  If you need to understand more about the science then read The Elegant Universe, but the true story is the relationship between these people that transcends time and death.The changes in the characters were subtle as each change in the past settled on the present. The son became confused, not sure what to believe and choosing to forget the details.  Just as we all do with something traumatic and since he is involved directly in the changing of the timelines, he remembers both, so at times he is not sure what to believe.It is good to see a movie that promotes family and marriage and friendship. A movie that says its okay to care.  It is wrapped up in an interesting set of circumstances that if you try to understand the science and not just want aliens and laser cannons and fighter planes in space, can run with stories by Heinlein and Bradbury.  It is a return of the finest of science fiction, a story that has heart and characters that have character and dignity.The audience laughed and cried and applauded, these were characters they cared about and even if they didn't understand the entire reason for this fantastic communication, they knew they wanted a happy ending for this family that loved each other so much.  The Kodak moments were done well, and used to pull at your heart strings and smile in remembering your own life's Kodak moments.  I have a better ending, but that's okay.  I didn't write the story, I just got to experience it.

It features some of the best acting of the year and impressive and assured direction.  Yet it leaves behind no distinct impression because of its slightness and overall improbability.  The plot revolves around a cop (James Caviezel) who contacts his dead father (Dennis Quaid) by ham radio.  His dad,  it seems,  can communicate with him even though they're separated by thirty years.  Soon they begin changing the past and the inevitable complications arise. Several things are admirable about Frequency  its attention to detail, its general unwillingness to be a cheap tearjerker (except for the excrutiating final montage,  complete with Garth Brooks song),  the assured and detailed direction,  the excellent acting,  and the genuine warmheartedness that pervades the movie.  Yet the movie is also patently ridiculous,  the jerky screenplay is a stumbling block and the ending is a copout designed as wish fulfillment for an audience unwilling to deal with anything wistful and thoughtful.  In short,  Frequency isn't a movie to rush out and see at the expense of something better you can think of.

It starts off well, with a shot of the aurora borealis firing up high over the earth.  Dennis Quaid, aging gracefully, exudes warmth and humanity as Frank.  Jim Caviezel is effective as well.  He has a soulful quality which is just right for the down-and-out character of John, who experiences growth and redemption when he finally connects with his father, in a way which is most unusual.  The scenes between the two of them conversing over the airwaves are quite moving, and I found myself getting misty-eyed a time or two (but don't tell anyone).  Gradually, however, the plot becomes increasing contrived, and the special effects take on an overdone quality.  At this point, my formerly misty eyes rolled heavenward at more than one point.

One of my pet peeves is a movie that can't make up its mind what sort of movie it wants to be -- no focus. In the wrong hands, Frequency would easily have fit that mold -- humor almost like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, emotional scenes like a family-oriented tear-jerker, a cop movie, a firefighter movie.

Even those who aren't die-hard time-travel film fans will enjoy the quirky plot points such as the world's oldest long-distance stock tip as well as the genuinely tender moments between father and son in both the 1969 scenes and over the radio receiver.The ending itself was acceptable and fit in with the plot, but the music that accompanied the very last scene was a distraction. In fact, a negative comment about that country music was the first thing I heard when the lights went up. This is nothing against country music, but after all, the film took place in Queens, NY. The ending cries out for an instrumental version of Take me out to the ball game, which would have been just as moving - perhaps more, because of how prominent baseball figured in the plot. Maybe they should change it in the video release. Despite this small flaw, Frequency is a nine, and well worth seeing in the theaters. DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!

In 1999, his son Jack (Jim Caviezal) still lives in the house. His mom is now a widow of 30 years who lives alone elsewhere. Without his dad for guidance all those years, Jack is now a semi-drunk cop losing his girlfriend. In both '69 and '99 a spectacular display of the aurora borealis lights up the big Apple skyline. And when Jack turns on his dead dad's radio, Frank's voice comes over the ether and decades between them. Somehow they can talk across time. Unfortunately, Jack can also warn Frank about his imminent demise and save his life. The consequences of that action begin to affect Jack's present and they must now try to undo the damage it does.The cause and effect relationship is the usual theme of any film that deals with time travel. FREQUENCY eschews the oft-used device of a time machine in favor of some sort of worm hole tied to solar flares, but the rest is pretty standard for the most part. The classic story from science fiction is of the hunting party that goes back to the age of the Thundering Lizards to kill T-Rex's. The hunters are told to stay on a special path, but one stupidly steps off for just a second to (not kidding) smell a flower. When he returns to the present, everything has changed including language. He finds a butterfly pancaked to the bottom of his boot. The big difference between stories of that ilk and FREQUENCY is that any change is looked upon as extremely verboten because of those consequences in most stories and in the movie they are viewed as little fires that just need stomping out for all to return to peace. Because the link between present and past is exactly 30 years and moves ahead concurrently with time, Jack and Frank cannot undo anything by simply going back and starting over. They must use their wits to overcome all setbacks as they occur.When a movie tries so earnestly as FREQUENCY does to be a crowd pleaser, pointing out its weaknesses is something akin to spanking a puppy who's misbehaving. Gregory Hoblit and Toby Emmerich, the director and writer respectively, try a juggling act between the three balls of logic-defying plot, cleaver plot twists and feeding audience expectations. By keeping the story moving pretty quickly and physically cutting it down to short shots, the audience isn't given much time to ponder the inexplicable. They also trust that the audience doesn't need to be spoon-fed some loopy reason why it's possible. For instance, even though there's a set-up for it that suggests it was taken out, neither Jack or Frank seek out help from the Eminent Scientist In The Field to explain how the premise is possible. Probably because said scientist would then be compelled by the Official Handbook of Obvious Movie Dialogue to warn of the consequences, ala the dinosaur-hunting story above. Very little time is spent waiting for the characters to accept that what is happening is possible. Little or no mention is made of the fact that this is the fall after man had just walked on the moon, making just about anything seem possible. The filmmakers understand that it's highly unlikely that anyone watching the film could have arrived in their seats without at least some vague notion that communication across time will be part of the story.As with any film made by bright storytellers, the biggest problem with FREQUENCY is the flip-flops it makes between respecting the audience's intelligence and insulting it. To example the former a crucial bit of information that will later explain why 3 women become 10 (excuse the vagueness, but more info would spoil it for first time viewers) is so casually presented many will miss it if they look down to get their soda. But later, a rescue in a burning warehouse begs credulity as Quaid goes from Brave to Super Fireman. It's best not to think too long over the logic concerning the changing past and present. For those who like a good Guilty Pleasure, FREQUENCY is the perfect film of that sort. It has a nice balance of original premise, exciting sequences and pull-on-the-heartstrings moments between a father and son who were robbed of growing up together. Similar, but not nearly as good as the superb FIELD OF DREAMS. Be warned, it will fall apart if you begin to dissect the time travel aspect after seeing it. A willing suspension of belief is a big requirement of watching FREQUENCY. RECOMMENDATION you can skip the theatrical release, but well worth a look on a slow video rental night.

In a film about time travel for instance, the impossible thing the audience will be asked to believe is that time travel is possible. No one actually travels through time in Frequency, but a man is able to converse with his long-dead father through a ham radio. The film succeeds at being utter fantasy and yet always remains firmly grounded in reality. The thing we're asked to suspend our disbelief for here is that a sunspot-triggered magnetic storm could create radio waves so powerful that they reach through time. We ask for this kind of whimsy from our movies, but on one condition we say, `what you show me does not have to be possible, as long as you make me believe that it is.' Once you've accepted that one leap, a movie like Frequency will hold you firmly in its grasp.Director Gregory Hoblit (`Fallen,' `Primal Fear') slowly and lovingly sets the story up and introduces us to the players. We've got Frank Sullivan, firefighter, hero, model dad, model husband, Mets fan. Hoblit takes no chances and makes this guy, with a lot of help from the guy who plays him, Dennis Quaid, the most likeable human being ever. Thirty years later, in 1999, we've got Frank's son, John (Jim Caviezel), now a NYPD homicide detective. John's life isn't so perfect. He's never been married, his girlfriend just left him, and he's taking to the bottle. He longs for simpler times, like when he was six and his dad was still alive. The 30-year anniversary of his father's death in a warehouse fire is approaching. He happens across dad's old ham radio and finds that it still works. The scenes in which the two men first speak are great pieces of filmmaking. This is not to say that the rest of the film disappoints, I'm just saying that this material could easily have been handled wrong Hoblit gets it right, scene after great scene.Frank is able to talk to his son only days before the fire that will kill him. John can warn him; he can now save his father's life. Here is another sequence that defines great filmmaking. I don't like giving away things, so I won't say what the outcome is. Anyone who saw the movie's trailer and really paid attention to it has a pretty good idea of what happens anyway. Without being specific, I'll say that past is changed. With this change come consequences. At this point, the film does a bit of a 180 and becomes a mystery thriller. This was a speed bump on an otherwise smooth road. I had difficulty making the adjustment from warm-hearted fantasy to hunting down a serial killer. Once I regained my bearings, though, all was good. Through great writing, performances, and direction, the film consistently keeps you guessing and challenges you, leading up to a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. Frequency is the kind of movie you really need to immerse yourself in and pay close attention to. Whenever a story messes with parallel timelines, with present events changing the past and therefore changing the present, you have to be on your toes.Grade B  "},{"Title":"A great movie without any hype","Date":"3 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  When I saw Frequency this past weekend, it was my first trip to the theaters in 5 months.

The movie is further enhanced by the strong acting by both of the leading actors, which is definitely one of the best qualities about this film. The father-son element is the essence of the movie and it is so well developed throughout, it was utterly moving.Some of the other things I liked about the movie are the superbly achieved editing during the various flashbacks and the many clues the writer had intelligently incorporated from the backdrop of the story into the plot. The ending sequence was also extremely well done and very satisfying. This movie is so much more than the usual one dimensional science fiction, I want to see it again.

Frequency stars one of of the best actors in Hollywood, Dennis Quaid (Frank) along with a rising star in Jim Caviezel to bring to the screen one of the unique and moving thrillers I have seen in a very long time.In the spirit of Ghost, Frequency is an epic story about father and son who reunite over the ham radio 30 years after Frank's death. Adding to the powerful and talented cast are Andre Braugher (Satch) and Elizabeth Mitchell (Julia.) I couldn't have asked for a better supporting unit than  these two fine talents because they bring character and integrity to their roles.I was in awe of this film because it really got to the core of the relationship of a father and son and how special it really is.

I know Heinlein inside out and backwards, as well as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. I have seen just about every A science fiction film in general release since 1970. My favorite film is Groundhog Day, and I enjoyed Back to the Future and The 1960 classic, The Time Machine with Rod Taylor and Alan Young. Until a few hours ago, I thought American Beauty, Magnolia and Being John Malkovich were the best scripts of the last decade. For sheer ingenuity, however, they can't hold a candle to Frequency. And it is Tobias Emmerich's first script! Can you beat that? But then, American Beauty was a first script as well. Maybe there's something about a fresh eye? Could it be we're about to enter another period of script and character-driven movies instead of special effects extravaganzas? We can only hope.

Nothing strange about that - you can talk with people around the world.  What makes these conversations unique are that dear old dad has been dead for thirty years. Even more bizarre is the set of events that their heart to hearts set in motion. As anyone who's ever watched Star Trek or read a science fiction novel knows, messing with time travel usually has unexpected and dire consequences. In this case, history is being repeatedly rewritten on the fly and bouncing off on different tangents (I won't elaborate any further).  Along the way, there are some interesting twists, touching moments and a decent story. Despite the fact that Dennis Quaid's character is the prototypical, blue-collar-red-blooded-All-American baseball-obsessed-cliché-spouting stereotype he manages to keep him from becoming annoying or unbearable.  Likewise, James Caviezel (who plays the son now grown up) although clearly not an Olivier, is able to hammer out a believable character.My only complaints are that there are few surprises, - if you have decent powers of deduction, you will figure out most of the surprises before they happen - and there are a few continuity errors.  Even so, the movie makes for an enjoyable jaunt.

I didn't have many expectations going in because the work of director Gregory Hoblit has been so disappointing in the past (FALLEN, PRIMAL FEAR), but he scores a winner here. Dennis Quaid's usual boyish charm, which can be irritating, is perfect for the character of Frank Sullivan, a firefighter who hasn't really grown up. James Caviezel provides the right combination of soulfulness and enthusiasm as a homicide detective who can't seem to get his life together.Quaid plays a heroic firefighter who lost his life in a warehouse fire during the 1969 Mets' World series win. Caviezel plays his grown son in 1999. Through a quirk of physics the two men make contact across the 30-year span over a ham radio. Their talks lead to changes in history that make the movie fascinating on that level alone. But they also work together to solve a 30-year-old serial murder case. One of the greatest strengths of the movie is the way Caviezel is able to show the slight changes in his personality as he and his father change history... both their own and that of the city around them.The movie slides effortlessly between suspense, humor and sentimentality... imagine being able to talk to someone close to you who died a long time ago. Imagine talking to yourself as a young child. This is the type of movie I like best.... I was enormously entertained while watching it, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the `what ifs.'

For a great deal of the movie, they don't.	However, after awhile, the you start suspending disbelief. The plot grows on you, and, before long, you are completely wrapped up in the story.	James Caviezel plays a police officer in the 1990s who, because of aurora borealis, is able to communicate via radio with his father (Dennis Quaid) in the 1960s. The two use the communication to avert a family disaster, only to find their meddling caused even more problems.	The problem with the movie is not the dialogue - in fact the scene when the two realize they're talking to each other is relatively believable. It's just that, after awhile, the complex history changes become overwhelming for the viewer. Instead of remembering one story line, the viewer has to remember multiple. For those viewers who thrive on being able to understand exactly what is happening in a film, Frequency can be frustrating at times.	About half way into the film, however, the viewers change how they watch the film. They let loose of the need to comprehend the science aspect of the movie, and focus more on the compelling adventure story.	The plot isn't the only thing that grows on the viewer. Set in Queens, N.Y., the film demands heavy New York accents from actors that take an awful long time to get used to. Like every other bothersome element of the film, however, the viewer begins to not even notice the accent.	Aside from the accents, the actors do a commendable job in this film. While Quaid seems to have a hard time playing a macho fireman, Caviezel is actually quite believable as a man who is battling the insanity of the multiple histories he remembers.	Overall, Frequency does a lot with the plot devices it uses. If viewers are able to not worry about believability from the onset, they will probably enjoy it even more.

You never know what's coming next.  I'm not talking about Usual Suspects-like twists or anything, but very effective act breaks that really turn the story and keep you interested, as it basically breaks down into three complete stories (for the price of one!) The story, on the surface, does seem a bit suspect.  However, it is dealt with precision in this script and in the direction which is also stellar. The action scenes are many and in retrospect don't make much sense at all, but while watching it, you never have time to stop and think about what's happening.

I felt the same way about Frequency as I did about two very disparate films Field of Dreams and The Sixth Sense.  All three manage to blend the fantastic with the sentimental, without getting either crazed or gooey.The basic plot is that a father and son, separated by 30 years, can converse with each other over a ham radio due to synchronized atmospheric conditions. The son's knowledge of the past causes ripples throughout time, and requires father and son to work together to prevent an event that would never have occurred without their meddling with the time stream.  That's all I'll tell you.The script is clever but not smart-ass about it, and Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel are both excellent as father and son.

If you are a fan of The Butterfly Effect you will love this movie because the premise (changing the a loved one's past) is very much the same. It's the thought that all of us wish for...the ability to change the past.This film doesn't do as good a job, has none of the (gallows) humor of BF, and doesn't have quite as many twists and turns and conundrums that get you thinking on your own of possible permutations. But since this one was written four years before Butterfly Effect, that's to be expected (that BF would improve upon this film since one must assume the writer saw it and was influenced by it in some way). Frequency is (at least in the cable version I saw) a much more family oriented movie, however. Although there is violence and sexual content it was muted down (cut with commercials). I don't know whether the uncut version is any tamer than BF, but parents should be cautious with both films and young children.You come away from Frequency having gotten close to the characters from the start, and feeling a tie to them, especially if you're from New York and have memories of the 60s. It's especially helpful if you're a Mets fan (I'm a Yankees fan, but it's close).So, what's the frequency? A 9 in my book! A high frequency hit.

My reasons for making this statement are the unique concept of the film, superb writing and strong performances.The writers created one of the best scripts and brought a wonderfully touching story to screen. I kept smiling throughout this film because it explored the unbreakable bond father and son share with one another. I knew Frequency would become a powerful and special film as soon as I saw the trailer for the first time. I was in shock when Frequency was left off the academy award ballot.Frequency is laced with story lines that would light up a dark room and brighten anyone's dark days. Frequency contains intense, adrenaline pumping action with edge of your seat suspense, excitement and drama.Frequency is a unique film that ranks in the top ten movies I've seen all year. Frequency is a unique film that will never be made again and if the chance arose this type of film is made; it will never measure up to the greatness of this film.Quaid, Caviezel, Mitchell and Braugher come together to bring one of the finest films to life. In the spirit of Ghost, Frequency is an epic story about father and son who reunite over the ham radio 30 years after Frank's death. However, throughout their conversations, they unintentionally alter the past and become thrust into a serial murder investigation. The cast support Frequency receives is powerful and rich.Quaid is one actor everyone can count on to give 110 percent in every film he stars. Frequency is one in a long string of films that keeps me in shock and asking the question why he hasn't had the opportunity to win academy awards since his performances were deserving.Caviezel's resume may not be high in quantity but it is high in quality, yet he is a tremendous asset to each film he stars in. Caviezel may not be a Hollywood veteran quite yet; but with his charisma, screen presence, integrity and intensity he deserves the title of veteran.Braugher provides great support in his role as Caviezel's partner and Quaid's friend in Frequency. I have always enjoyed Braugher from his role on the television series, Homicide Life On The Street because his presence is felt with each scene was in; a fact which holds true in every film he is in. I look forward to each film he is in because like Quaid he gives 110 percent.Upon listening to Garth Brooks' When You Come Back To Me Again, I immediately thought it was the perfect compliment for the film. This is one the top five soundtrack songs that I've heard.Only one word comes to mind when describing my overall feeling of this film EXCELLENCE. Every part of Frequency is excellent. From the powerful and moving performances to the edge of your seat drama, Frequency will delight and amaze every viewer.It is my honor to let everyone know Frequency is one of the best films released in 2000.

It seems to me that this is much more plausible ( if at all possible ) than actually physically traveling to other times. In this particular movie, the usual mess up of the space-time continuum results by the communication. I like that the movie doesn't explain how the communication takes place, but just suggested by showing shots of the northern lights. As a result of the communication a man, John Sullivan, in the present changes the past by giving known information about the past to his father, Frank Sullivan ( who is dead in the present ) in the past. I also like how the changes to the past affected John mentally - he is confused because he remembers the original chain of events, but also can remember the 'new' chain of events that replaced the original events. I've never seen a time travel movie depict how that would affect someone. The major change created by the across time communication is that a serial killer in the past ( which John in the present is still investigating as it was never solved ) operates for a much longer time than he orginally did and, also, John's mother, Julia ( Frank's wife, of course ), becomes one of the victims. The rest of the movie deals with John and Frank working together to find out the identity of the killer and stop him before he gets to Julia. Great idea to add a thriller aspect to a sci-fi movie.

A surprise, in that it didn't fare better at the box office; it deserved much better. The plot is well thought out (a lot of small details play a role in the development of the story), the performances are good, and the actors look their age (i.e., the wigs don't look too phony). This is the one movie that taught me to look beyond the number of copies left on the shelves at the video store. Also, it surprised me that so many elements fused together so well into a single movie it is a drama of a family (and their friends) strongly held together by their love, yet it also reads like a mystery novel where all the little pieces of the puzzle come together (and very well at that), and it is a very good thriller (I kept feeling chills for the characters even after I'd already watched the film twice and knew exactly what was coming up next). It has some element of a sci-fi, such as the very premise on which the entire story is base, but except for that, I wouldn't recommend this as a sci-fi movie.  A little piece of advice for future viewers out there STAY AWAKE. The very charm of this film is that almost every detail counts. Not all of them have equally far-reaching repercussions, but the director and writer seem to have seen to it that the story is told with maximum efficiency and subtlety. This might explain the lack of appeal to one-time theater audiences; it is indeed almost impossible to catch everything at a casual one-time viewing.Finally, don't expect from this movie everything that a good drama has. If anyone asked me to characterize this movie, it'd be as a MYSTERY. The other components, might be there, but leave room for improvement. For instance, the characters, heroic and loving as they are, are a little bit too good to be true. But that is probably the one complaint I have about this movie. I heartily recommend it to those of you who enjoy a good thriller and can stay alert for 118 minutes.

The problem with 'Frequency' mainly is its writing by Toby Emmerich. In fact the film becomes funny after a point, escapism crosses limits. There in no problem is escapism, I mean that's cinema, but there is a limit to it. But these flaws are only visible & talked about when a film fails to entertain you fully! The plot of the Mother & the Serialkiller looks forced. It's doesn't create any excitement. Also the culmination doesn't look convincing! Coming to the right points Hoblit's direction is perfect. Cinematography by Alar Kivilo is excellent, capturing every frame beautifully. In the acting department, Dennis Quaid excels in a Tailor-made role. The legendary actor is in excellent form. James Caviezel is very good; this is his finest work. Elizabeth Mitchell get limited screen time, but she makes up for it. A young Michael Cera makes a brief appearance, he's fine.

The pacing is brisk with each radio communication between father and son used to bookend the sequences where their next crime-fighting strategy takes place, as well as filling the void since the father 'died'. The plot holes are glaring and you need to turn a blind eye and indulge yourself in the father-son relationship. For example, the firefighter father is saved from death by his son telling him he should have gone the other way in the burning building, but this is information the son had no way of knowing about - how could he tell what decisions his father made inside a subsequently collapsed building just before he died? These kind of inconsistencies crop up regularly. Put them aside, worry about the family issues, and you will feel justified in giving up your tears at the end. The climax, when it comes, is, with hindsight, predictable and fitting, but quite moving all the same. Turn off the DVD before the schmaltzy photo slide-show that puts a lid on events, an awful missed beat in a film that entertains for the most part.

The film also includes, to confuse the plot even more, a 1960's serial killers who by the past being changed ends up murdering the mother and wife of the father and son who changed it. The two who are involved in this inter-dimensional, and 30 year, relationship who exist in two different or parallel universes at the same time.If the movie Fernquency stuck to the time travel angle, like the far better Butterfly Effect, and showed how changing the past, if at all possible, can make things even worse then they already are it would have streamlined it's story. Not only making it far more believable but interesting and easier to follow. But by the film instead putting in a crime angle it just completely short-circuits and flips you out. We have in the movie both father and son Frank & John Sullivan, Dennis Quaid & James Cavlezel, working together in two different time periods, 1969 & 1999. They not only solve the Nightingale serial killings but prevent the murder of Frank & John's wife and mother Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell), who if it wasn't for the two fooling around with the past in the first place, which would have never happened. The manipulating of time also has them causing the murders of an extra seven women in the process!Frequency would have far more entertained, instead of bored and confused, it's audience if it's just put in some kind of logic that would have had people watching it overlook it's ridicules plot. The amazing and mild boggling story also includes and factors in the Amazin Mets. The Amazin's not only pull off one of the biggest upsets in Baseball history, by defeating the overwhelmingly favored Baltimore Orioles in five games in the 1969 World Series, but also have a lot to do with convincing the police to the serial murders. With family friend and precinct captain Stach Deleon ,Andre Braugher, getting information from 1999 thirty years earlier by both Frank & John about the outcome of the series before it actually happens!Were made to believe in the movie that an unusual conjunction of tremendous Sun Spot activity together with the Northern Lights of the Auroral Borealis caused all this weird action to happen. All this supposedly had radio signals not just travel through space but also through time! Uniting both father and son who haven't seen or spoken to each other for thirty years since the father was dead for all that time!Finding his dad's old ham radio 36 year old cop John Sullivan somehow gets in touch with his father Frank just days before he was to be killed in a fire on the New York Docks in October 12, 1969. At first not believing what he's hearing John is soon convinced that it's really his late dad that he talking to. John takes a while to convince Frank that he's really his , at then time back in 1969, six year old son whom Frank affectionately calls Little Chief.John telling his father what's to happen the next day, Otober 12, 1969, in a fire he'd be fighting as a member of New York's Bravest. Frank does what he's told to do by his grown up and future son John aka Little Chief that ends up saving his life. What it also does is put a whole new set of events into motion that would end up having his wife Julia murdered by a serial killer!. The strange event would also prevent the serial killer from being arrested for another crime that he committed in March 1970 and thus have him free to kill an additional seven women that he, if John hadn't fooled around with the past, would never have murdered.It's now up to both John & Frank, like some time traveling tag-team combination,to change and keep re-changing the past after screwing it up until they finally get it right! The two now attempt to bring their wife/mother back to life and at the same time prevent the serial killer from the past in 1969 now alive and well in the present from murdering John! It fact it was John who stupidly confronted the serial killer and spilled the beans about what he knows about him. John some how now plans to undo the killers work that he and his father made possible in their playing around with the past!The ending was just too much to take that you have to see at least a half dozen times to fully understand. We have John battling it out with the killer in 1999 as Frank was at the same time fighting the same person, who's thirty years younger in 1969. Both father and son finally meet in the flesh as the killer, who was about to do in John, lost the use of his right hand in 1999. This happens by getting it blown off by Frank with a shotgun in 1969. The by now totally confused killer gets himself blown away with the same gun by an older and grayer Frank in 1999. All this because of Frank's son John saving him from getting killed in 1969. Were supposed to believe in the movie that Frank lived all these thirty years hidden away from his friends and family and anyone else he was supposed to have any contact with in some weird state of inter-dimensional limbo!

He is surprised to find another person using the same frequency in this age of phones and the internet, and he starts chatting with fellow New Yorker, Frank. After only a few conversations and events John starts to suspect (but not believe) that the other man is none other than his father and that somehow they are talking through time and space. Events convince both men that this is true and John uses the link to give Frank the advice he needs to survive the rescue that once killed him. However the repercussions are greater than they could have imagined and it is not long before Frank and John are frantically trying to repair the damage they have done.Although I never got around to watching this film when it was released, it still looked interesting to me and I was glad to find it on television recently. The story is almost in two parts, with the first part being more emotional involving the relationship between the father and son while the second part is more a thriller. The first part is enjoyable because it manages to get past the sheer implausibility of the concept and engage me quite easily; it could have fallen at this point but it just about made it work. The main reason this part works is the way that it delivered good emotional involvement from the characters to make me focus on that rather than the concept. This is also the reason the second half of the film works &#150; because I was into it and into the characters by this point so this wasn't just a matter of the film sinking into a standard thriller plot. On top of this I found the story to be told with tension, pace and quite an interesting idea (if you can get past the weakness with the core idea); It is exciting and all the better because you actually care about the characters.Of course part of the character development is the actors' performances and, once I got over their heavy Noo Yark accents, I enjoyed but Quaid and Caviezel. Despite not sharing the screen together, the two had great chemistry while also producing convincing emotions in their individual performances. Needless to say, both perform well in the action stakes as well. Support is OK from people like Braugher, Mitchell, Emmerich and others but really it is all about the two leads, who do well with what they are given.Overall this is an enjoyable sci-fi thriller that could have been average but is actually a smart affair that has a strong foundation in the emotional core of the relationships and characters, thanks to the script as well as the two lead performances. It is only really in the final few minutes that it messes up the emotional stuff by getting far too mushy but by then the fun has been had and the memory I have of the film is a good one.

My reasons for making this statement are the unique concept of the film, superb writing and strong performances.Congratulations to the writers for creating one of the best scripts brought to screen since Titanic. I kept smiling throughout this film because it explored the unbreakable bond father and son share with one another. I knew Frequency would become a powerful and special film as soon as I saw the trailer for the first time. I was in shock when Frequency was left off the academy award ballot.Frequency is laced with story lines that would light up a dark room and brighten anyone's dark days. Frequency contains intense, adrenaline pumping action with edge of your seat suspense, excitement and drama.Frequency is a unique film that ranks in the top ten movies I've seen all year. Frequency is a unique film that will never be made again and if the chance arose this type of film is made; it will never measure up to the greatness of this film.Quaid, Caviezel, Mitchell and Braugher come together to bring one of the finest films to life. In the spirit of Ghost, Frequency is an epic story about father and son who reunite over the ham radio 30 years after Frank's death. However, throughout their conversations, they unintentionally alter the past and become thrust into a serial murder investigation. The cast support Frequency receives is powerful and rich.Quaid is one actor everyone can count on to give 110 percent in every film he stars. Frequency is one in a long string of films that keeps me in shock and asking the question why he hasn't had the opportunity to win academy awards since his performances were deserving.Caviezel's resume may not be high in quantity but it is high in quality, yet he is a tremendous asset to each film he stars in. Caviezel may not be a Hollywood veteran quite yet; but with his charisma, screen presence, integrity and intensity he deserves the title of veteran.Braugher provides great support in his role as Caviezel's partner and Quaid's friend in Frequency. I have always enjoyed Braugher from his role on the television series, Homicide Life On The Street because his presence is felt with each scene was in; a fact which holds true in every film he is in. I look forward to each film he is in because like Quaid he gives 110 percent.I know I have consistently said music and soundtracks are one of the most powerful selling points of a film. From Trisha Yearwood's rendition of 'How Do I Live' for Con Air to Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' in Titanic comes a song so powerful and touching it will leave you in tears. Garth Brooks rendition of 'When You Come Back To Me Again' put icing on the cake and made me watch this film.Upon listening to this song, everyone will get a sense of what this movie is about. This is one the top five soundtrack songs that I've heard in my life because it is the perfect companion to an already perfect movie.Only one word comes to mind when describing my overall feeling of this film EXCELLENCE. Every part of Frequency is excellent. From the powerful and moving performances to the edge of your seat drama, Frequency will delight and amaze every viewer.It is my honor to let everyone know Frequency is one of the best films of 2000. I have seen Frequency so many times I've stopped counting after 10. Frequency is an A+ in my book.

I won't reveal the plot but suggest that you read the summary and then decide if you want to watch the movie.The strength of the film is in the actors, the direction and the father son relationship. The two principle actors, Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel, carry the film as only good professionals can. Their down-to-earth approach to the roles brings a believability to the film that the plot lacks. There is also a strong frequency between them that strikes the perfect note of father-son loveThe direction, particularly in the action sequences is excellent. At times they leave you breathless.The father-son relationship is always a difficult one. The mother is always the comforter and tends to remain close to her children for life. But the father is the one that generally prepares the son for life. The son needs, at some point to reject this direction and strike out on his own. In the Oedipal pattern, the son kills the father and marries the mother. Certainly this desire, modified into into different forms, is present in many father-son relationships. In the end, unless the people involved are psychotic, father and son remain loving but distant and somewhat frustrated by a desire to be closer. The film plays well into those desires. The bonding of father and son later in their lives and the healing of old wounds is the real theme of this film. This is what appeals to the many positive reviewers here. It strikes a strong nerve in our society. It struck a strong nerve with me. If my father were still alive I would have rushed over to see him. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of fathers and sons became closer due to this film - it is that good. So read the plot summary, get used to the idea that it is improbable, and then see the movie for the action but mostly for the human side of it.

Kamen's musical score is nothing to write home about, but the acting and directing are good enough, particularly Dennis Quaid, who brings a New York working-class accent to the role and does a nice impersonation of a guy pushing 70 at the happy ending. Andre Braugher is an exceptional actor with an extensive range. Also quite good is the performance of Shawn Doyle, who plays Jack Shepherd, the killer cop. He's got the role down perfectly. In many of his scenes he's not required to do much but be sinister or roll around in hand-to-hand combat with one of the Sullivans, but there is a scene in a bar, in which Cavaziel confronts the now aged Doyle, in which his face is a changeable and fleeting mask of indifference, curiosity, and hostility. And Doyle does it with a total absence of ham. And let's give makeup the round of applause it usually doesn't earn.The plot is complicated, as many time-warp films tend to be perforce, and there were times when I was confused, especially during the climactic action scene. In fact, I'm still a little -- well, maybe it's me. The plot also simplifies life in 1969, presenting us with nothing but happy homes straight out of a 1950s TV family series. I don't suppose you could really drag in Vietnam and racial conflict and dwell with such obvious relish on the same oneiristic images of innocence and Coca-Cola. If Dear Old Dad has a single flaw, it's that he smokes, and the film is politically correct and savvy enough to have him give up the habit grimly and with determination and a sense of moral rectitude. You can practically feel the audience breathe a sigh of relief and fresh air.Field of Dreams, in which a troubled son finally contacts his long-lost troubled father, was an extraordinary success in 1989 so I suppose this re-rendering eleven years later was expectable. Warner Brothers used to recycle the same plots with different actors in different jobs and the same underlying dynamics. It might be Edward G. Robinson working way up on the cable towers in Manpower or Bogart behind the wheel in They Drive By Night. It didn't matter. The underlying mythical armature remained the same. It won't matter here either.Years ago I pulled my car off the Trans-Canada highway to spend the night curled up in the back seat, parked on the outskirts of some small town in western Ontario. I was waked up by the barking and howling of dogs violating the post-midnight silence. What was bothering them were the northern lights, slowly shifting curtains of rainbow-colored hues, barely bright enough to lighten the landscape. That was in July in Ontario. So I suppose we can accept the same display in Queens in the Fall. These lights break up and disappear after the need for electromagnetic communication between father and son is finished with.

There is a period of 30 years involved and concentrates on the life of a Fireman and his family and a son who becomes a Policeman. This film is like a time capsule or Sci-Fi and takes you back into the past and the future during a certain period of time. There is a serial killer on the loose who has committed many murders of young women and there are efforts to prevent these crimes from happening.

The story is emotionally enthralling as hardly any other, especially as John ultimately changes the past. The sequence showing how Frank survives and how John's memory changes at the same time (!) is awesome! The viewer has to stay alert and stick to the pace of the storyline. The reference to baseball is a nice one too. The kids in here, just as Michael Cera and Daniel Henson are perfectly cast and very genuine. Despite the emphasis on the excellent time-travel story mingled with suspense and a thrilling crime story, it's the father-son aspect that broke my heart.

Most notably to me was a scene that was supposed to take place in 1969, Frank (Dennis Quaid) flips through his albums and in that shot you see the top of the album Elvis In Concert which was not released until 1977 (8 years later!) As a former record retailer, I spotted it right away, as I'm sure any Elvis fan likely did as well. Picky, I know, but that IS the job of a props person; to make the surroundings and settings as real to the time being portrayed as possible.

A sheer delight, the acting was fist rate and the creativity of the plot was better than many other of its genre. I recommend this film to everyone.

"},{"Title":"Caviezel before he was Jesus","Date":"9 February 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" While far from perfect, at least this movie featured worthy performances, plus an intriguing (if complicated) plot line and some good old-fashioned heart. Frequency tells the story of John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), a down-on-his-luck cop in Queens (circa 1999) whose life apparently spiraled southward after his fireman father (Dennis Quaid) died on the job thirty years earlier. The movie doesn't explore John's unfortunate circumstances much; he's shown arguing with his girlfriend once, plus he drinks some, and Caviezel makes a few sardonic comments and looks bitter. But this lack of development can be forgiven for two reasons one, Caviezel possesses such a genuine sincerity that it's hard not to like his character, despite the fact that we don't really know him; and two, John discovers the ham radio early on into the film, setting up the most intriguing part of the premise. What ham radio? Why, the very radio which belonged to Frank, John's father! John starts to fool around with the radio one day. He picks somebody up, much to his surprise ... and lo and behold, the person he's chatting with about baseball and Queens is his father Frank -- all the way back in 1969!! These scenes -- with Caviezel, Quaid, and the radio -- are definitely the highlights of Frequency. The scene in which the father and son's identities are revealed to one another is engaging; particularly charming and poignant is the scene where a present-day John talks to his 1969 family (including his younger self). Thanks to the radio, John is even able to warn Frank about that fire and prevent his father's death!Regrettably, after this history-altering incident, the film became more than a little ... confusing, to say the least. Frank appeared to still be alive, but I was unclear as to whether he was living in the 60's or the 90s's. While John's warnings that cigarettes will become the true cause of his dad's death send a positive message about health, this doesn't really go anywhere. Even more puzzling is the big serial-killer subplot revolving around John's nurse mother. I knew the killer was stalking nurses, and I knew that as Frank tried to stop him, he became a suspect himself -- but my clarity ended there. Again, WHEN was the killer killing?! Was John's mother alive or not?! In fairness, I watched Frequency on an airplane... so some of my confusions could very well have resulted from the interfering loudness of the plane's engine, or the interruptions of dinnertime. I have to say, though, that I think writer Toby Emmerich simply tried to squeeze too much into his script. The serial killer plot was unnecessary. The relationship between Frank and John made for an interesting enough film. My other gripes are minor and mostly have to do with a bit too many close-ups of eyes and such. Overall, Frequency DOES have a lot going for it!Supporting performances by André Braugher (who somehow manages to look exactly the same age in 1969 and 1999); Elizabeth Mitchell; and Noah Emmerich are on the mark. I liked how the movie hinted at the importance of familial relationships. I'm not really a baseball fan, but I didn't mind the baseball elements in this movie... which were sort of quaint. Plus, I've always had a weird fascination with things like ham radios.Finally, as I mentioned earlier, Jim Caviezel shows he's one to watch for in this earlier starring role. His own father had a brush with death some time before this movie, and it's evident in his performance that the subject matter is close to his heart. You can see the sincerity in his eyes! And that makes it hard to criticize Frequency, although once the serial killer plot starts up the movie becomes simply too confusing to really get involved with.All in all, Frequency is a movie that starts out great and slips into being merely good. However, good is good! You don't need to make a huge effort to see it, but if and when you DO see it, I'm sure you will enjoy yourself.

Not by a long shot.If your confused and you actually kept reading to this point, here are the spoilers/explanation for what I'm saying John Sullivan saves his fathers life by letting him know how and when he will die, once his father makes the needed change and survives. The son, John Sullivan, memories partly changes and he has brand new memories of his father living until he dies from Cancer.  BUT! And this is a big one, since John Sullivan affected time and in turn caused his mother to be killed by the serial killer he had to be shown pictures and told that his mother was dead.  If you watch the movie again or just think back to all the Twist & Turns you'll see these inconsistency's all over the movie.  I felt like the Director and writer thought it was okay to change the rules just to make the movie more interesting, and that's what I call poor writing.I know that most of you that gave this movie a 7 to 10 rating think I'm being to picky or I can't suspend my disbelief, but some of my favorite movies are time travel flicks and all of them have much better consistency this movie, heck, even Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure had better consistency then this one.I recommend you go watch H.G.

However, Frequency just goes too far.  Most of the movie is consistent, but the few places where it totally defies logic and confuses its own rules really stand out in my mind.  I don't think the movie could have done too much better of a job with these, though.  The subject itself can very quickly become a pandora's box, and I think it definitely does here.  Those who can't forgive plot holes or loose ends will probably have a strong dislike for this movie.Perhaps also of note is that this film is really just a thriller with a little sci-fi twist added in.  Yes, the motivating force behind much of the events in the movie is the son's desire to have his father back.  However, at a certain point the father-son story gets shoved in the rear as bland thriller action and suspense take over.  This could be said to be a metaphor for how we want to spend our lives with our family and friends and lovers, but the real world creeps in with its own truths; but for me it just was a clue to the fact that hollywood likes to have its movies chock full of action and romance and less full of sentiment and subtlety. Perhaps the factor that most tipped the movie toward the negative for me was the use of Baseball.  I have no problem with baseball in movies, but I felt like the writers added in baseball as a father-son bonding element for no reason at all.  It was almost as if they pulled some father-son ideas out of a hat, and one of them was baseball.  There are other, far more meaningful things even in the movie itself that could have been used, and baseball seemed to be the cheap, cliched way out.

During an atmospheric phenomenon, John finds his father's old HAM radio, and somehow, he can communicate to Frank, 30 years in the future. With this ability to communicate, John manages to save Frank from the explosion that would have killed him, and the also save the lives of other souls. But more importantly, they are trying to find a way to stop a serial killer from murdering John's mother/Frank's wife with a 30 year gap.

What would you say, how would you react? And what if you knew how, when and where they died, and could warn them of their forecoming doom?The questions are answered in Gregory Hoblit's Frequency, in which a young man speaks to his father thirty years into the past. The story starts with Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), a veteran firefighter who dies in a factory fire in October, 1969. Exactly thirty years later, in 1999, his thirty-six-year-old son John (Jim Caviezel) has become a police officer, breaking a tradition of all firefighters on his father's side.One night as John is rummaging through a compartment under his stairs (he occupies the same house he grew up in), he comes across his dad's old ham radio. Out of morbid curiosity he sets it up and, eventually, manages to make it work. He clicks it on and a static voice comes across on the other end, asking John to identify himself. In the minutes that pass, John realizes he is speaking to his father on the exact same night, thirty years earlier (or thirty years later, depending on whose perspective you are taking into account).The excuse for this wonderous ability of time communication is really quite nonsense - it has to do with a solar frequency in outer space that happens to be encompassing the sky in both 1969 and 1999 - but we instantly connect with the plot. The characters seem real enough, and sometimes that is all that counts. Recalling the plot of this film on my computer makes it seem just a bit more hokey than it was when you watch it. And that's probably the sign of a good director - one who can make skeptical audiences actually believe his ludicrous plot.Through talking to his father, John is able to warn him of his death. Frank does avoid dying, but this sets off a chain event. By not dying, Frank's wife, and John's mother, who is a nurse in 1969 and 1999, was never told of her husband's death in 1969 (because he didn't die in this alternate timeline.) Therefore she never left the hospital that October night to grieve over her husband's death, and because of this, a serial killer known as the Nightingale Strangler (or something like that) ends up killing John's mother on her routine way home from the hospital, along with six other victims who were not killed in the original 1999. But in the current 1999, John now has all the case files of the murders, since he is a cop and has access to them, and that means he knows when and where the Nightingale Strangler will attack. So 1969 Frank starts a case of detective, scoping out the joints on the night the killer murders his victims. Frank manages to grab some fingerprints of the anonymous killer, and in a very inventive plot twist, sticks the fingerprint evidence in a bag, hides it in his house, and tells John where he hid it. John goes looking in the 1999 house, and finds the evidence, right where Frank left it hidden in 1969.A lot of the timeline theories in Frequency don't hold up. The movie reminds me of Back to the Future quite a bit, except the latter's plot makes theoretical sense and the former's does not. Take, for example, a scene where Frank, in the past, carves the words I'M STILL HERE, CHIEF into a table with a motor mechanism. John, in 1999, sees the words being carved as it happens in the past. Smoke comes out of the table as it happens and everything. But in reality, Frank would have done it thirty years ago, meaning that the table would have the words carved into it long before John sees them being carved invisibly. It's like in BttF Part II - when Biff gets his hands on that sports almanac, everything in the future suddenly changes. It doesn't start happening as Biff does it in real time. Confused? Me too.Also, when Frank survives his destined death because of John's warning words, John suddenly gets new memories. Since his father never died, he now gets all these memories of them together after his (Frank's) death from the original 1969. He says to Frank later that night that now he has two streams of memories - those of Frank's death and afterwards, and those of Frank living and afterwards. But somehow, everyone else does not remember Frank's death - only John. Why? Simple There wouldn't be an interesting film without it.Frequency has almost as much thought put into its time changing as BttF, but lacks the hard conviction that the Future movies had. They made sense, had little plot holes - or at least plot holes that could be analyzed. Frequency has a lot of plot holes that simply cannot be analyzed. They're just there.But this movie has some major highlights. A battle between a serial killer in 1969 and 1999 is visually and psychologically thrilling, and very ironic in execution; moments like the fingerprint evidence being hidden, though a bit shallow, are fun - and the characters and actors are superb. This might not be as deep as Back to the Future, but I found myself lost in this film, never checking my watch for its one hour fifty minute + running time. And that's a pretty rare thing these days.4/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"An Unusual Twist on Cinematic Time Travel That Doesn't Seem to Understand Itself","Date":"27 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" An odd twist on time distortion in which, due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over Queens, a New York cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long-dead father thirty years in the past. Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories.

However, 20 minutes later the movie starts getting quite interesting, with a sort of Twilight Zone-like plot that is fun. But this, the movie's only bright spot, lasts only about half-an-hour. What happens from there is YET AGAIN the same cops and robbers bulls**t that we've been served so often in recent years. We have a serial-killer - surprise! - and the movie becomes a stupid thriller.And guess who the killer is? A cop. But of course. Aren't all serial-killers cops? After all, Kiss The Girls, Nightwatch and so many other crappy thrillers tell us that mass-murderers are always cops, so the writer of Frequency must have thought it best to play it safe and make this killer a cop, too. (Apparently, American police departments have a huge need to hire psychopaths into their ranks... an idea which left-wing anti-authoritarian hypocrites would embrace in a jiffy.) What follows in this thriller-half of the movie is a series of typical modern thriller clichés and dumb plot twists that will have your head spinning in disgust. The second half of the movie is almost like some silly comedy-of-errors; whatever Cazaviel decides to do to amend a problem which he created, he only makes things worse (kind of like that MTV idiot in The Butterfly Effect) - and that's another problem with the movie, it's predictability. After all, nearly every time-travel movie (and this is a time-travel flick, not a ghost story) punishes any kind of meddling in the order of events, and so it predictably has to be here, too. The grand finale is, as was to be expected by that point, just another stupid will they stop the killer in time? collection of idiotic scenes that nicely round off a movie that could have been so much better.The facial make-up is pretty bad, too. If everyone is 30 years older, then either get different actors or make it that only 15 years have passed (i.e. get Cazaviel to be somewhat younger as a cop, and somewhat older as a kid.). However, if they did that then the story couldn't unfold in 1969 - the magical year for every liberal douche bag.Why does every comedy, every drama, every fantasy nowadays end up as a mere cops and robbers story? I'd like to watch 3 movies in a row that don't have cop characters. Is that possible? Is that too much to ask? Is crime really the only aspect of society worth putting on the big screen?

Amazed John uses his knowledge of the future to save his father's life from a fire he is supposed to die in, at first Frank has a hard time believing it but does indeed end up surviving the fire that was supposed to kill him. At first everything seems great & John has a whole new set of memories of his father but strangely none of his mother, it turns out that they somehow changed history to the extent where John's mother & Frank's wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) has been murdered by a brutal serial killer known as the Nightingale. Both John & Frank are determined to stop it from happening & catch a killer in the process...Co-produced & directed by Gregory Hoblit this is an OK sci-fi drama that isn't really my type of film. The script by co-producer Toby Emmerich takes a while to get going & begins like some horrible Disney style sentimental drama which is just the sort of thing to send me to sleep but then it it takes a different direction & turns into a murder mystery as John uses his knowledge of the past to help his father track down the Nightingale serial killer, it's quite a neat idea actually & if not for the overly sentimental drama & slow pace this might have been a great film. To be honest many people out there still might think it is a great film as I could see people of a certain age enjoying this but anyone who likes a bit of bang & excitement in their films is going to have a hard time sticking the whole 2 hour running time out as it can be a little dull on occasions. The character's are good & well fleshed out, there is a decent enough story here & I thought it was watchable without being outstanding. One more question, why didn't Frank put a few nice little bets on the outcome of the baseball games John was telling him about? Or maybe even John could have given Frank some lottery numbers so they could get rich, you know what I mean? I'm sure I would have.Director Hoblit does alright, it's quite a measured & somewhat sedate film. It looks nice enough but there's not much style here although there is a good opening sequence involving a crashed petrol tanker & a spectacular explosion. There's not much of a mystery element as the Nightingale killer is revealed fairly early on, it's not scary or exciting either, it's just all very average & middle of the road really.With a supposed budget of about $31,000,000 I'm surprised a film such as Frequency had so much money lavished on it, I could have told anyone it was going to flop. Anyway, it has that big budget Hollywood polish about it & it's well made with good production values. The acting is pretty good as well.Frequency is an OK time waster, it may be slightly over sentimental & a tad slow for some but there's a decent enough story here.

There, a 20th Century teenaged boy finds himself in telepathic communication with an 18th-Century teenaged girl.  The story knew where to focus on the boy and the girl.  Here the two central characters are a man and his father, who have already met each other in the ordinary way, back when the former was a child; the new, extra-ordinary relationship that trans-temporal communication makes possible isn't developed at all - at least, not on the screen.  Instead we get frenzied hyper-plotting involving a serial killer and contradictory causal chains.The Twilight Zone episode was, by the way, consistent.  The boy saved the girl's life - which means he had an effect on the past - but he did not CHANGE the past.  One can change many things, but the past (like the future) is not among them.  Consider  A dies in 1969.  Then B makes it the case that A doesn't die in 1969.  The contradiction is glaring enough already; adding the detail that it was A's very death that caused B to prevent it merely only makes it more so.I'll admit that incoherent stories like this can be told with art.  One can make the incoherence itself part of the beauty of the story (like in this Indian folktale Once I was climbing a tall tree in the middle of the forest.  But I climbed too high.  I had to walk four miles to the nearest village to get a rope, so that I could climb down again), or one can skilfully hide the incoherence, so that it doesn't get in the way.  What one can't do is leave the contradictions in full view, and ask everyone not to notice.In short the story is nonsense, not even charming nonsense, and there are no virtues it has gained at the expense of being nonsense.  I'm as willing as the next guy to appreciate a film that loses its characters in narrative cleverness.  This one loses its characters in narrative stupidity.I miss The Twilight Zone.

The film itself is entertaining, to say the least, but to accept it you have to really just throw any prior knowledge of physics or logic you might have out the window. I suppose that goes without saying being that it's based on the notion that you can alter the past while watching the changes concurrently in the present. Though, I guess if they had stayed true to logic they wouldn't have been able to make this movie at all.If you understand the concept of time and are at all annoyed by those who butcher it to pieces, do not watch this movie, unless of course you find joy in pointing out flaws. However, if you don't think too deeply about the logic of time and are interested in unrealistic plots with predictable twists and ridiculous happy endings, you'll probably gawk at it and think WOW THIS IS GREAT. Honestly, it would've been more acceptable if it had been a silly family film, such as Back To The Future, but this movie is just too far off to be taken seriously.

US cop communicates with dead firefighter father by means of chance 30-year time travel radio link. The twists in the plot due to backdated events become too entangled to be interesting after a bit. Plenty of the audience were laughing at bits that were meant to be thrilling/moving/revelatory. A few nice action scenes, and reasonable acting, but the rest was a mess.

Much like a BAD dream!","Date":"2 June 2000","Score":"3 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  For a movie to have a scientifically flawed premise and then to present so many time continuity issues and have us believe it is just too much to ask. The first hour of this movie is paced like a yellow flag at the Indy 500. You can go ahead and go to the snack bar, because it is such a long time between times during which anything happens, you are not likely to miss anything.  I have only seen one other movie with pacing that is this bad, The Horse Whisperer.  I was willing to suspend my disbelief that these guys could talk to each other 30 years apart.  I was going through some small issues about how they were changing the future.  He seemed to still have the same job, live in his parents house, and still have the radio on the desk plugged in. Although other things were affected by the changes in the past these things were constant.  This was sort of a problem, but I kept on chugging through.The third strike is the ending, which was wrought with so many problems you can only discover by watching this piece of garbage. I just don't have enough room for them in this review. The fact that the writers and director of this movie had no more respect for the intelligence of the movie going audience is scary.  The premise of the movie could have been over looked to the fact that this is in the fantasy genre. I just have to draw the line when the fantasy becomes so overpoweringly unreal that I wake up from the dream. I would rather find myself in a room being stung by a million angry hornets than EVER have to see one more instant of this disgraceful movie.
