That may sound too derivative for some tastes, but I neither give points for originality nor subtract them for a lack of originality. All that matters to me is that a film works on its own terms, and Mimic, despite a couple small flaws, is very effective.Those couple small flaws include that you have to pay a lot of attention during the beginning if you want to catch all of the backstory--it moves by very quickly, with pertinent information frequently mumbled or given in the background, and some of the attack scenes are a bit too dark and cut to simulate a whirling dervish.The biggest asset is the production design. Mimic has a delicious horror atmosphere that you could cut with a knife. Of course it's easy to achieve cringe-worthy moments when the screen is filled with bugs and characters are crawling down (and in some cases living in) dingy subway tunnels, but almost every shot in the film has a similar effect. Gloom, decay and disturbing, unidentifiable biological masses are the visual themes. The creature designs are fantastic, with the mimicking design being the most impressive.Of course, the plot is somewhat predictable, and the don't tamper with nature subtext is as conspicuous here as it was in Frankenstein (1931), but predictability isn't a flaw here, and Frankenstein was a masterpiece. Mimic has an absorbing story, with likable characters and suspense to spare.

On the strength of his first foreign indie feature *Cronos*, and then this minor masterwork (his first foray into Hollywood), one was expecting great things from this director. Lately, however, he's doing hack-work on things like *Blade 2*. Whatever -- Hollywood, I guess.In the meantime, please check out *Mimic*, if you haven't already. Yeah yeah, sure sure, it owes a lot to *Alien* (visually), *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* (thematically), and even Fincher's *Seven* (visually again). But then, those movies owe a lot to their OWN influences indeed, science fiction is a pretty incestuous genre, with surprisingly few innovations, at least in cinema. It's enough of a pleasure to watch a guy do this type of thing correctly, which is to say, he puts his own vision and concerns to great use. This movie, like all great genre pictures, exists comfortably in two spheres on the simple level, it speedily entertains as a gory fright film imbued with mordant humor; on the more difficult level, it provides symbolism and thematic undertow. Best of all, these two levels often work at the same time, such as when an old priest gets tossed off a building by one of the creatures, plummeting past a neon JESUS SAVES sign, and crashing to a gory death on the pavement. A little while later, the creature drags the dead body into the gaping black maw of an open sewer.The corpse is gone, forever. JESUS SAVES--? Not really, I guess not in Del Toro's world of relentless survivalism and hyper-competitive reproduction.For the latter is what *Mimic* is really about the importance of breeding and offspring. The movie's surreal opening, with its rows of linen-canopied hospital beds all in a row like so many little coffins, shows us sick children, gasping for air because a cockroach-borne disease is carrying them off. The battle lines are drawn in the first few moments Us versus Them. The casualties thus far are our most precious commodity our kids. Cutie-pie scientists Mia Sorvino and Jeremy Northam glean the cure for the dread disease by concocting a genetically-altered bug whose secretions kill off the diseased cockroaches. But this Judas Breed, as it's called, will be the only true breed this couple will engender Sorvino fails pregnancy tests at home, while their creature -- supposedly unable to reproduce -- grows apace underneath Manhattan's fallopian sewers. Which, by the way, are strewn with the rapidly-developing creatures' eggs. It merely seems like Nature's Way that the Judas Breed has mutated to the size of six feet, and can mimic standing upright like their ultimate prey, Man -- even sporting a man-like face as a sort of cover that splits apart at will, revealing the Bug Within. It's also fitting that these creatures instinctively hone in on the vulnerability of children they viciously rip apart two kids, and befriend another who has managed to communicate with them by clicking soup-spoons together. (Perhaps they consider the little bugger might be a possible playmate for their own offspring, while they wait for him to get big enough to eat.)Del Toro ties in his reproductive symbolism with religious motifs. (Judas Breed.) The bugs, for instance, desecrate an old Catholic church in the city . . . but then, they're helped in this by the humans, who have barred entry to the church and have covered up the wooden saint statues with cobwebby plastic covering. Humanity, playing God by giving birth to unhallowed creatures, unwittingly colludes in its own extinction by denying God, to say nothing of the aforementioned curse of sterility. I've already covered the fate of the priest. There's much more, including Charles Dutton's physical sufferings that amount to a sort of mini-Passion, as well as another character's use of a pseudo-stigmata to kill one of the creatures.But the best pleasures reside squarely in the thrills and fun of the thing. If nothing else, the scene in which a Judas Breed reveals itself to a running-away Sorvino -- running after her, scooping her up, and then flying off into the dark subway tunnel -- justifies the rest of the film's symbolic mumbo-jumbo. Speaking of Sorvino quibble about her inadequacy all you want, but she's pretty (when not covered in bug-guts), and in any case Dutton's heroic performance cancels out the bimbo factor. Dutton gives his all in this film. Luckily for him and us, the film is more than worthy of his efforts.

A scientist, Susan Tyler, breeds a new bug that mimics the cockroach and wipes out the disease.  However years later something is living in New York's subways that looks human.   Tyler suspects that her breed has not died out but has evolved to imitate it's natural predator - us.  Her investigations into the subway lead her to more than she bargained for.This is an atmospheric thriller from Guillermo del Toro, director of The Devil's Backbone and Cronos.  He manages to mix great director with good old fashioned monster horror to great effect.  The concept itself is clever, even if the idea of bugs evolving to look very like humans is a little far fetched.  However, once the action moves to the subway the fact that the bugs are clearly lethal no matter what they look like, makes this less important.  The film is quite short and makes the action come quicker and seem more urgent.  Several people get killed by the bug that wouldn't usually get killed in this sort of horror (children for example), this is very effective as it is quite scary to see the unexpected happen.The mood is dark throughout and Del Toro uses the sewers and subway to great effect, creating a real sense of claustrophobia - like the humans have entered the bug's world and not the other way round.  The bugs are shown early on in the film - usually not a good idea (keep it hidden in the Jaws way), but here the special effects are good enough to make the bug really believable.  However the horror is not in seeing the bugs but in they way they hunt and kill - the fear is in what could happen.  That's why seeing them doesn't take anything away.The cast are great, Sorvino especially is very good in the lead.  Jeremy Northam and Charles S. Dutton are good in support and Abraham Murray adds a bit of cameo class (though his role is quite unnecessary).  But the director is the real star adding some genuine scares and real mood to a film that could have easily been just another creature-feature that goes straight to video and straight to the back of your mind.Overall a superior creature horror film.

Credit goes to using a short story written by a real SF writer, Donald Wollheim, instead of the usual Hollywood hack, who doesn't know a transistor from a donut, as well as the people who adapted it without messing it up.Much of the scenery, makeup etc. reminds me of some of Fellini's movies,  with an atmosphere that is truly frightening, like a nightmare.

The result was Mimic; a surprisingly ordinary Sci-Fi thriller that balances between an Alien rip-off and a typically 70's creature feature. It's not a bad film and definitely one of the best achievements of the weak 90's decade, but it lacks something special, something exclusive to make it truly memorable and/or an absolute genre favorite. The film revolves on a deadly plague of genetically manipulated cockroaches and the mimicking of the title reverts to the scientific fact (apparently) that certain insects physically 'imitate' their natural enemies. What I really appreciated about the film is the whole background-story why Dr. Susan Tyler tampered with the DNA of cockroaches in the first place! No deranged scientists messing with Mother Nature's creations to boost up their own egos this time, as the genetically altered cockroaches exterminated the carriers of a disastrous epidemic that nearly killed an entire generation of New York children. Only, the new & stronger roaches refused to die afterwards... Three years later, the species moved itself up a couple of places in the food chain and lurks its human pray in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Mimic eventually disappoints because of the shoddy special effects and some hopelessly muddled sub plots. A boy obsessed with shoes? Dubious 12-year-old merchants?? The impenetrably dark subway-setting hasn't got anything original to offer and there sure are scarier monsters than man-sized cockroaches. Del Toro's directing is occasionally very stylish, especially during the atmospheric opening sequences with the aforementioned eerie epidemic, and Mira Sorvino is truly good as the lead heroine. Good supportive cast, too, with F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus, The Name of the Rose), Giancarlo Giannini (Black Belly of the Tarantula) and Norman Reedus in his (very small) debut role.

And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones.Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in Quarantine, this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was Quarantine (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but Mimic excels because it is so much more artistic at it.

You can tell that this film was a stepping stone, allowing him to to gain the experience necessary to make future classics like The Devil's Backbone, the two Hellboy films and of course, his masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth.This film oozes (often literally) with the things that del Toro clearly loves. Insects. Sewers. Autopsies. Quirky characters. Clockwork. The unborn. Everything. And you can tell, despite the drama on-set, that del Toro's wonderful fingerprints are all over the film. (In both the director's and theatrical cuts.)In the midst of a viral epidemic of Strickler's Disease (an illness responsible for a growing number of deaths amongst children), Entomologist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) uses genetic engineering to create the Judas Breed- a new form of insect that will kill of the cockroaches containing the dreaded Strickler's Diesease. In order to ensure that the Judas Breed will die out, it was designed specifically to die off after only a generation. However, three years later, Susan discovers that the Judas Breed has somehow survived. Aided by their altered body-chemistry, they have managed to somehow breed and evolve, growing and changing to blend in with natural predators... including humans. Together with her husband Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam), a shoe- shiner named Manny (Giancarlo Giannini), his Autistic son Chuy (Alexander Goodwin), a police officer (Josh Brolin) and a subway guard (Charles S. Dutton), Susan must find a way to stop the growing threat presented by these new forms of the Judas Breed, before they manage to blend in, infiltrate and destroy humanity.The cast is absolutely superb. In particular Sorvino and Giannini, who steal the show. Everyone gives wonderful, superb performances that humanizes the horror and drama, creating a wonderful sense of dread when they are in danger. The only sore thumbs here are Dutton and Brolin. Both fantastic actors. And both are decent. However, their limited material (somewhat more one-dimensional than the other characters) makes them feel a bit more flat than other characters. Still, they do a decent job. They just don't quite fit in with the rest of the cast.The direction is magnificent, as is always the case with del Toro films. While his prior work Cronos was a very good start, and contained the first hints and glimpses of his style... here, we are given a definite plunge into the mind of del Toro. The direction is absolutely incredible, and his choices in shots, composition and movement are beautiful and poetic, and create wonderful senses of love, fear, dread, drama and even hope. A true mastermind of cinema.It's hard to judge the script, knowing many scenes were changed, altered, dropped, etc. But the writing in general is quite strong for a genre-film, and characters are (for the most part) well-developed and possessing enough quirks to make them identifiable and worth caring for.Other aspects of the film are all generally strong. From some stunning cinematography courtesy of Dan Laustsen, to the absolutely bone-tingling (and action packed) score by the magnificent Marco Beltrami, to the wonderful mixture of practical and CGI effect... everything gels into a well-oiled machine to deliver del Toro's Gothic horror beats.I'm honestly shocked that this film doesn't have the recognition it deserves. Sadly, that is often the case for not only del Toro's film (his other works such as Pan's Labyrinth and even the recent Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, which he served as a co-writer and producer on, are all tragically under-recognized despite their rampant strengths), but also good horror in general. It's a shame that the masses pass up on unique, well-made chillers in favor of generic sequels and processed PG- 13 fluff. But that's a rant for another time.As it stands, I give Mimic a strong 8 out of 10. (That's for the director's cut. The theatrical cut is more of a 7 out of 10. Still good, but not QUITE as good.) It's definitely a film worth checking out for fans of Sci-Fi, Horror or pure cinematic thrills.

I agree. It's a very well done and well crafted movie. A giant bug movie is just the tip of the iceberg. A contemporary sci-fi/ horror movie is a decent way to sum it up. I have begun to wonder if any, (If not all) of those who dislike this movie have even seen it or have just jumped the band wagon. This is not a misfire or a sophomore slump.

The carrier of Strickler's Disease has been identified as the common cockroach. Entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) has a plan to release the Judas Breed, a genetically engineered insect resembling a gruesomely unholy combination of a roach, a praying mantis and a termite, into the sewers to kill the disease-spreading cockroaches. Within months, the city's cockroach population has been virtually wiped out, thus bringing a very swift end to Strickler's Disease, with the Judas Breed insects genetically designed to die out after a single generation.Tyler and her colleague, CDC physician Dr. Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam), enjoy their 15 minutes of fame while also finding the time somewhere in their quest to begin an affair and get married.Three years later, in 1997, a string of gruesome murders and disappearances has the local cops puzzled and fearing that a serial killer may be on the loose. However, startling evidence begins to arise to suggest that the Judas Breed not only never died out (like they were genetically modified to do so after a single generation), but have evolved into a perfect hunter that is now, in evolutionary terms, a deadly rival to human beings as the dominant species of the planet, and have been living and breeding by themselves in the abandoned subway tunnels of New York City for the past three years. The creatures have also evolved the ability to begin to mimic their greatest adversary human beings.Mimic is the 1997 big-studio English-language debut of Mexico's famed Guillermo del Toro (Cronos), who not only directed the feature, but also shares writing credits with co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins. The story itself is adapted from the short story of the same name by the late science fiction author Donald A. Wollheim (which I have not yet read).Mimic contains many of the same directorial trademarks that del Toro has since become famous for, including a strong humanistic touch with identifiably human characters, insects, religious symbolism and allegory/imagery, and some occasionally grotesque violence/gore. (And of course the movie also has a dire warning about science, unchecked, going places that it shouldn't - in this case, upsetting the balance of nature through genetic engineering.) While Mimic can be accused of containing many slasher movie elements that are also dually characteristic of much of today's horror (don't get me wrong, del Toro is skilled in the direction department and gets a few good scares and occasionally shocking and gruesome imagery), it is balanced out with an interesting premise that reveals that there is a lot more going on here than just a monster on the loose killing people.As I noted before, del Toro has a keen eye for religious symbolism and imagery, and he takes this with the Judas Breed - an obvious reference to the biblical Judas Iscariot, who of course, betrayed Jesus Christ to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver. Here, genetically modified insects resembling the carriers of the deadly disease are introduced into the malefactor's population, only to betray them and wipe them out in the end. But in a horrifying irony, the same creatures that were designed to be our saviors, may just replace us as this planet's dominant species. It's pretty frightening stuff when you get down to it.For this type of picture, I find how incredible it was that del Toro was able to get Mira Sorvino for the lead in this movie, coming just two years after her Oscar-winning performance in Mighty Aphrodite (1995). She is seen as someone who believes in serving the greater good by trying to eradicate a horrific disease, only to learn later of the error of her mistakes in trying to play God and must now put her own life at risk to clean up those mistakes and save the world.Other performances are worthy of honorable mention, including Jeremy Northam as her husband, and Charles S. Dutton as the hard-nosed metro-transit cop Leonard. Alexander Goodwin is also quite charming as Chuy, the autistic son of shoe-shiner Manny (Giancarlo Giannini), who also possess an uncanny ability to communicate with the deadly creatures.Mimic is a great early effort from the one of this generation's most visionary filmmakers. Guillermo del Toro would gain later degrees of fame with the superhero films Blade II (2002) and the Hellboy series, before becoming international and Hollywood royalty with his best feature to date, Pan's Labyrinth (2006). He would also become blockbuster gold earlier this year with Pacific Rim (2013).7/10 "},{"Title":"Insect Thriller.","Date":"28 August 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F.

It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a creature feature. If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film.The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet!This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this.

And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's Mimic is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch Mimic.

I suppose he saw A GIANT MAN-EATING COCKROACH in his OWN BATHROOM.Talk about household pests with an attitude...Onto the film In Manhattan, cockroaches are spreading a deadly disease that is claiming hundreds of the city's children. Entomologist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) uses genetic engineering to create what she and her colleague (and husband) Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam) call the Judas Breed, a large insect (looking like a cross between a termite and a praying mantis) that releases an enzyme that kills off the disease-carrying roaches by speeding up their metabolism. The Judas Breed work spectacularly and the crisis is abated. Since the Judas Breed have also been designed to only produce one male able to breed, and they keep it in their care, the hybrid species should die out in a matter of months.Some years later, people begin to go missing in the subways and tunnels under the city. Susan, Peter, and their staff learn that they severely underestimated the Judas Breed's ability to adapt to its conditions. The Judas Breed has found a way to reproduce and has evolved in order to better hunt a new food source. To everyone's horror, they discover that the Judas' new food source is humans, and now the insects have grown to be as big as people and can mimic the appearance and behavior of humans with uncanny accuracy. Susan and Peter have learned that huge swarms of the Judas Breed are living beneath the city in the subway system, and with the help of Leonard (Charles S. Dutton), a transit system police officer, they search out the insects, whose quick evolution (one fertile male and hordes of females) also made them humanoid, before they can take over the city and from there the world.Talk about a weird selection of actors in the film.

That's not to say that Mimic's a bad science fiction movie. At times it's creepy, and the basic idea that a new strain of insect mutants can mimic humans is intriguing. But ultimately Mimic is so farfetched that suspending one's disbelief becomes a real problem. Forget the mutants. The hardest thing to believe is that several of the protagonists can stumble into a New York subway station that's been closed off for 75 years, yet still get an old subway car working again by simply putting a couple of wires together, using one character's metal-framed glasses to complete the arc. Then they plan on riding the subway car out into one of the main lines, even though they're trapped underground without a way out. If there's an open track, why are they trapped for the last half hour of the movie? And how can one guy spark off a gas explosion huge enough to blow up cars on the New York streets above and yet still have enough time after the ignition to dive into water? It's bad enough that guys like Bruce Willis and Arnold can outrun gas explosions; here's a guy who's right at the center of it, yet he's given time between the spark and the explosion to escape.

It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie.A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners.Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it.Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been.The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on.A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing.

Despite an ending which Del Toro hates, I absolutely love the film. I grew up with it the way it is and enjoy it for the story it has, regardless of any qualms its creators have with it. It's a lovely throwback to the creature features of the 1950's, with Del Toro's own unique, high concept flair. And what a blast of a concept for a sci fi monster flick. When the New York cockroaches start carrying a deadly virus that's killing children, a scientist (Mira Sorvino) genetically engineers a mutant breed of insect to kill off the infectious ones. Her plan works, but there's just one problem they have both bred and evolved into something monstrous. Many insects use mimicry as a defence mechanism or a predatory lure. These ones become so advanced and massive that they can imitate the silhouette of a shadowy human figure. Terrifying, right? Not the kind of thing you'd wanna run into in a dark alley on your own. They lurk around dank areas of the NYC subway system, preying on vagrants and anyone who comes near them. Pretty soon word gets back to Sorvino, who realizes her mistake and attempts to find, confront and stop the creatures. It's schlocky, yet has a specific biological order and symmetry to the things which go bump in the night, which is Del Toro's trademark, really. He always gives his otherworldly beasts such a sense of purpose and functionality to captivate us. Jeremy Northam plays Sorvino's boyfriend, along for the spooky ride, as well as F. Murray Abraham as a kindly professor, Charles Dutton as a wise cracking cop, Giancarlo Gianninni as an Italian shoe shiner, a brief Norman Reedus and a scene stealing Josh Brolin as a sarcastic Detective. It may not have everyone's seal of approval, and hold the stigma of being the black sheep in Del Toro's stable, but it's got merits in my books. It's got a boundless imagination, one of the creepiest, smoke machine infested New York City settings in the horror genre, and above all knows how to have fun.

Dutton and even Norman Reedus. The actors and actresses did help make Mimic stand out as a good horror Sci-Fi and as a watchable movie.For a movie of this type then the special effects are crucial. And the effects team in Mimic did come together quite nicely and came up with some very interesting effects and creature designs. I have always been fascinated with the mimic ability of these insects since the first time I watched Mimic back in the late 1990's.Mimic is an entertaining movie that does hold some good thrills. For a horror movie, then there is actually nothing scary about it. But that is not a bad thing, because the movie is entertaining as a thriller. And director Guillermo del Toro masterfully built up the suspense in the movie quite nicely, a suspense that permeated the entire movie from start to end.

When this one does work, it's usually due to the creatures themselves here, which is quite fun as the film gives them some rather enjoyable elements starting with their origin and back-story. The idea of being bred to contain a viral disease through genetic mutations is certainly fine enough, yet there's more here with the mutation offering the chance to really change their behavior around for the better here as it comes from a realistic adaptation in the real creature. This feature helps this one along nicely by playing into the setting here with this one being in the underground sewers and tunnels when the adaptation is put to good use blending in and launching their attacks which are quite fun as it leads into a lot of action here. From the opening rooftop chase to the encounter with the boys in the tunnel as well as the church stalking and the encounter in the abandoned subway station, there's a lot of great action here that all sets up the fun of the finale. The attack on the subway car is quite chilling, the race to get to the surface is even more impactful and there's even more fun here with the chain reaction explosions and stalking done here that really makes this fun while giving it a couple gory kills amongst the action. Along with the fantastic look of the giant, humanoid cockroaches, there's enough here to help this out against the film flaws here. One of the biggest is that the film suffers from the overly-complicated scientific explanations for what's happening, as despite making sure it's stood but also hammers down the explanations to the point of overkill. Due to going into detail with every person they come into contact with, at times this makes the film feel like it's going on an extended loop for no real reason. Another factor to this is that it appears too long for its own good, especially in the early parts trying to examine everything which makes the film feel incredibly long and not all that interesting focusing on the scientific angle. Even some of the CGI shots here are quite weak and seem obvious, especially at the end where the exaggerated movements give away the technique and stands out during the fine action scenes. These here are what hold this one down.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-danger.

Now, the insects are out to destroy their only predator, mankind.This film is loved by some people and that is clear by the sequels it received. Exactly why is unclear, as it is rather average and not a highlight of 1990s horror. Specifically why Del Toro disowned it is not known to me, but it does have to rank among the lowest of his career, so that is not surprising.There are some good concepts. The idea of genetic modification is always popular for a science-gone-wrong story. And we also have the idea of an invasive species introducing a species to remove an old one, only to to find the new ones has things we may not like about it.

The ending as well is too Hollywood for a Del Toro film.The director's cut adds in a few more scenes which explains things a little more but don't improve the movie much at all, so if you hated the theatrical cut you wont like this version much more.Overall it's an enjoyable film and if you're a Del Toro fan or monster movie fan check it out just know its not one of his best but had lots of potential.

Oscar winner Mira Sorvino stars as Susan Tyler, an entomologist. She comes up with a plan to eliminate cockroaches in NYC, which are now spreading a fatal disease dubbed Stricklers' to the city's children. Her solution is to contrive a new hybrid species of roach - the Judas - which will wipe out the roach population, while being supposedly unable to breed themselves. Three years later, the so-called solution is now the problem, and the Judas breed has done a lot of evolving - and has proved itself capable of breeding after all. (As Ian Malcolm of the Jurassic Park story would have said, Life found a way.) Now Susan and a select few others descend into the bowels of the city to try to put an end to things once and for all.After clashes with Bob Weinstein, Del Toro ultimately disowned the film, but at least in more recent years his original directors' vision has become available on Blu-ray. Over all, it's a richer, more satisfying experience than the theatrical release. Granted, at some points some of the characters start to grate on the nerves, but in the end they regain ones' sympathies and rooting interest. Donald A. Wollheims' story was adapted by Matthew Robbins and del Toro, and the filmmakers take full advantage of some very spooky concepts and settings. This directors' cut, running 112 minutes, is deliberately paced but quite suspenseful, and features striking digital effects and creature designs by (among others) the legendary Rob Bottin (The Howling, The Thing, Total Recall).Not all of the characters get fleshed out all that much, but the cast gives it their best effort. Josh Brolin and Oscar winning veteran F. Murray Abraham are kind of wasted, but their presence is still very welcome. The beautiful Sorvino is very credible and is playing a reasonably strong woman. Jeremy Northam plays her husband, Giancarlo Giannini is endearing as a middle aged shoe shine man with a young son (Alexander Goodwin), Charles S. Dutton is typically commanding as a subway cop, and Norman Reedus fans will thrill to see him in a small role.Mimic does require the viewer to pay attention, because key exposition is divulged in a very quick manner, but it rewards them in kind. Its ambiance is perfect horror movie stuff through and through.Eight out of 10.

This would be celebrated even if the roaches weren't killing everyone's kids. Everyone is happy with Ms. Sorvino's remedy. She hooks up with handsome Jeremy Northam (as Peter Mann) and thinks about having children of her own. But, wait&#x85; something has gone wrong! Judas Breed was supposed to be unable to reproduce &#x96; and they were scheduled to disappear completely around six months after killing the roaches. Apparently, they stuck around and grew into huge, hungry critters...Stylishly produced and directed, by Guillermo del Toro, Mimic is an engaging horror suspense story...The special effects and story fit together well and the monster effect is well-designed. The film startles with early developments, then becomes fairly predictable. You may not always know who's going, but you should be able to figure out who's coming back. Suffering from severe potty-mouth, Charles S. Dutton (as Leonard) is most obvious. Less so are Giancarlo Giannini (as Manny) and young Alexander Goodwin (as Chuy). While the insect effect is very good, some of the science could have been more realistic. The worst moment may be when Sorvino's presumably brilliant character states humans evolved from apes. Scientists smart enough to evolve insects would know humans and apes possessed common (DNA) ancestors.

Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed.

But it was sort of meh whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

Sexy entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) believes that the answer to the problem is a genetically engineered bug, sterile and with a limited lifespan, that secretes an enzyme designed to speed up the roaches metabolism, thereby starving them to death.Three years after introducing her killer bug to the cockroach community, the disease is a thing of the past; unfortunately, Mother Nature has a surprise up her sleeve&#x97;Susan's bugs have evolved into intelligent, man-sized, man-eating monsters capable of mimicking humans.Although big bug movies are usually tackled in a fun, campy manner given their patently ludicrous premise, Mexican director Guillermo del Toro approaches his tale with the same grim solemnity, symbolism, and dark fairytale style atmosphere which typifies much of his other output. The setting is the grimy streets and even grimier underground system of the Big Apple; it's nearly always raining; and everything is artfully lit by faulty fluorescent lights, which cast eerie shadows and lend a feeling of unease and the amazing thing is, it probably all would have worked, if it hadn't been for those meddling studio types.This being del Toro's first Hollywood flick, the people in charge were apparently a little edgy about letting a relatively inexperienced foreigner have complete creative freedom on their project. A little studio interference later and what you have is a pretty decent film that could have been so much better if only the director had been allowed to do his thing without restraint. The end result certainly has its good bits (great production design, a few decent action scenes, cool critters etc.), but there are other moments which feel rushed, ill considered, and just a tad plain awkward.I particularly disliked the autistic lad whose raison d'être seemed to be to allow Susan Tyler to show her protective maternal side in the finale, much like Ellen Ripley in Aliens, a film to which Mimic bears more than a passing resemblance (a dark claustrophobic atmosphere and a voracious monster that hides in the shadows). The ending, although well handled by del Toro, also contains some ridiculous plot devices, including an abandoned underground trolley that still functions after fifty years, a missing fuse replaced by a pair of wire spectacles, and Susan Tyler's husband somehow escaping a massive gas explosion.I enjoyed Mimic for what it was&#x97;an interesting work from a talented film-maker that sadly failed to meet its potential&#x97;and would definitely be interested in seeing a 'Director's Cut' (especially if there's a longer version of the scene where Sorvino is perched on the edge of a bath in her undies&#x97;hubba hubba!); but in the meantime, I simply must find out whether Sorvino's hair was deliberately styled to look like an insect's antennae (two strands of hair dangle in front of her face), or whether I'm simply looking too hard for things that just aren't there.

These bugs are only supposed to live a few months, however, out with the confines of laboratory conditions they evolve at high-speed into something far more deadly than the original cockroaches.Mimic is a fairly standard 90's sci-fi horror that warns us against trying to outsmart nature. The first half of the film, where the new threat is gradually introduced is good. The element of mystery works well, and it's genuinely intriguing trying to work out what is going on. The various encounters with the title creature are quite scary and well done. The central idea of the artificially fast evolving mimicking insect is a good one. It's a concept that is utilized well in the early part of the movie where the mimic idea can be used to full effect. It's only when the action moves to below the city into the disused subway that things start to flag a bit. The monster is revealed in its true form and the film loses the sense of strangeness that the central concept provides. From here on in Mimic becomes a fairly typical sci-fi horror film, with the usual heroes trapped by lethal predator's scenario.It's a decent effort though. It's entertaining enough with at least one original idea. And I guess at the end of the day that's one thing that sets it apart from a lot of other similar movies.

Atmosphere and visuals can be great in and of themselves, but it's common knowledge that the only way an audience will actually get scared is if they have something invested in the fate of the characters. For that to happen, they people populating this movie actually need development. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here.In New York City, a deadly disease is wiping out all of the children. Since no vaccine or cure can be found, two scientists, Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) and Dr. Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam) decide to go after the carriers of the disease cockroaches (it's at this point that it becomes helpful to know that cockroaches are very adaptable, and would probably survive a nuclear holocaust, but never mind). The scientists create a new species, the Judas Breed, that is designed to wipe out the roaches, thus killing off the disease. Problem solved, right? Not quite. Three years later, the once-savior is now our worst nightmare.The leads are not ones that are normally associated with this kind of a movie. Mira Sorvino may have won an Oscar (which undoubtedly attracted the attention of the Weinsteins), but she's no Ripley. Sorvino holds her own, but she just doesn't have the screen presence needed to pull off this kind of a role. Same goes for Jeremy Northam. Northam is an accomplished British actor, but he just doesn't seem tough enough for his kind of role (one could argue that this makes them seem more real, but it isn't true). Josh Brolin has what could charitably be called a cameo, but the other two supporting actors, Charles S. Dutton and Giancarlo Giannini, are two people we can really feel for. Dutton is one of the great unrecognized character actors, seemingly able to conquer any type of role and draw the audience's sympathy like a magnet. Giannini, another good performer is in a role that is a far cry from his performance in A Walk in the Clouds. Giannini's great, but the script doesn't give us the depth that the actor does. And Oscar-winner F. Murry Abraham is also on hand in a brief appearance as the sort-of creepy mentor to Susan.When it comes to making creepy crawlies, no one does it better than Guillermo del Toro. Unfortunately, producer interference hampered his efforts in other parts of film-making (like plot coherency, for example). del Toro knows how to tell a story, but the money loving and creativity phobic Weinsteins stifled it as much as they could. All that's left are some tense moments and moderate shocks. del Toro was right, this could have been so much more if they had allowed some time for character development.Still, if you're afraid of the ooey-gooey or the stuff that goes bump in the night, Mimic is worth a rental.

Okay, maybe a little more kill then infiltrate. The story really is quite ridiculous as I see writing a synopsis down here, but del Toror creates mood and suspense and makes it work to a degree. Very formulaic as we see a small group down in the pit of the bug kingdom. Charles Dutton plays a cop like you would expect him to, but he is always very fun no matter how poor the dialog or story get. In fact the acting is decent throughout. There are some weird sub-plots - one in particular with a strange kid named Chuy. He barely talks and only looks at shoes...hmmm. His father is played by Giancarlo Giannini(from Hannibal fame) and he does a nice job. F. Murray Abraham is again slumming in a B picture but as always gives a nice performance. I never will understand why an Oscar-winning actor like himself never had the career he should have enjoyed. I digress though. Mimic is a fun, entertaining picture that is heavily flawed and hugely unbelievable, yet the acting, the director's visual sense of storytelling, and the eerie sets make it worthwhile in the end.

The bug mimic's its most dangerous adversary Man and used that camouflage to go upstairs, on the streets, and feast on unsuspecting New Yorkers.It's when people start disappearing in large numbers that Susan and her boyfriend Peter become suspicious that something about their creation of the Judas Bug went very very wrong.

What Susan, who studies insects for a living, should have known is that in the insect world it takes just years, or even months or weeks, for them to adopt to dangerous and inhospitable environments that it would take man tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years to adopt to if at all!

Most of his other output has horror elements, but Mimic was an actual creature feature. What I had seen of Mimic had never impressed me, but I figured I owed it to the great director to see this early studio work. I wish I hadn't. This is not the del Toro that we know and love. This is another example of the Weinstein's scooping up young talent and botching the finished product. Mimic takes place in a world where cockroaches are carrying a plague that is wiping out a generation of children in New York City. Enter CDC frontman Jeremy Northam and bug expert Mira Sorvino to fix the situation. They create a new breed of bug, the Judas breed, to infiltrate the cockroaches and kill them off. The Judas breed themselves have a short life span so as to die off quickly and put Mother Nature back to rights. Like any good creature feature, this is not the case. The Judas breed evolve and begin to mimic their natural predators Man. This leads to your standard Aliens territory that we've all been privy to many times before. The staleness of the last act is not the only problem here. Sorvino and Northam have no chemistry at all, and co-stars Josh Brolin, F. Murrey Abraham, and Charles S. Dutton are completely wasted. While Mimic is clearly a victim of studio tampering, it's still a blight on the wonderful career of Guillermo del Toro. May it be the only one.

The script by Toro & Matthew Robbins certainly moves along at a brisk pace & never gets bogged down with too much scientific nonsense, there's just about enough explanation here to keep things reasonably plausible (in a fictional film sense of course) & with that out of the way the film gets on with it & does what it does best, it has plenty of dark corridors with slimy things running around trying to kill our protagonists while they fight to stop these things spreading any further. The character's are alright as is the dialogue but nothing that special & why did that big bug creature let Susan live in her lab? I mean it killed everyone else who messed with it including two young boys so why not her? It had the opportunity didn't it? The first half of the film focuses on the investigation side of things as they try to figure out what they're dealing with but later on it turns into an Aliens (1986) clone where they are stuck & trapped by these things which want to kill them, it all works pretty well & while not the most original film ever made it's a perfectly watchable & entertaining one.Director Toro does a good job here, he keeps the action quite tight & he uses the confined subway system to decent effect. By a complete coincidence I watched the British horror film Creep (2004) last night which was set on the London Underground & I could relate to that so much more than Mimic, this film seems very 'staged' & 'deliberate' & while I have been to New York I've never travelled on the subway but I doubt Mimic will have many people nervous the next time they step on a New York subway train. The whole film is pretty dark with a depressed look about it, it's constantly raining, overcast & everything seems to be in a state of disrepair. There's not really any gore in it apart from a cut leg although the special effects on the giant bugs are pretty good.With a supposed budget of $25,000,000 Mimic is well made & has that Hollywood polish to it. Apparently director Toro disowned Mimic after a lot of interference from the boys at Miramax. The acting was a bit flat actually, it was OK but no-one stood out.Mimic is a neat little horror film, sure it's nothing original & nothing stands out that much but it's a decent watch & worth checking out.

How they do so is highly improbable, but it makes for a slam-bang finish to a very tense and scary sci-fi/horror flick in the tradition of ALIEN. The atmosphere throughout is dark and moody, and the monsters are rarely glimpsed until the last 10 minutes. They are virtually unstoppable, which makes the film even more harrowing. And yes, two children are savagely killed, a first for an American horror flick (albeit directed by a foreigner, G. DelToro). Two inferior sequels followed this.

Parts of Mimic are actually brilliant pieces of horror movie making and should be viewed in film school classes. But his skill cannot entirely save him from putting a foot wrong here and there, mainly because he falls into the cliché swamp once or twice too often. There is also some choice dialogue to howl at! Mira Sorvino in the lead was a nice surprise. I was not used to see her as anything else than a lovable dumb bombshell (I know she isn't one in real life) but her part her acquires her to be both assertive and, at the same time, confused and vulnerable by the events her actions have set in motion. Considering the rainsoaked environment and the credit sequence, I wouldn't hesitate to call this movie a cross between Se7en and Them.

Yes, the box art is derivitive of every other creature-feature released at the time (see Phantoms, etc.), but don't let that mislead you.  The film does follow some pretty standard pacing (for the genre) and there isn't much mystery as to what will be the science of the monsters' demise.  However, with director Del Toro's growing presence as a fresh new voice in the horror genre (Blade II, The Devil's Backbone), 'Mimic' has taken on some new characteristics.  Present are several of Del Toro's trademark themes, i.e. Man vs. A Monster He Created, Monsters Through the Eyes of a Child, to name a couple.  You even get the director's penchant for for religious imagery, which he uses quite interestingly, as he does not use it in the Damien/Omen way we're so tediously used to.  'Mimic' is not the best film in Del Toro's still young career, but it's worth looking into for its style and decent popcorn thrills and gore.

When I watch this film, among others, I forget that I am a film major and I concentrate on the fact that this film is just plain scary and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I will reveal that no character is invulnerable, and even the lead is capable of dying.  That idea, of the lead dying, is frightening in itself, because that usually never happens.  This film in one word is SCARY.  I enjoyed this film so much that it disappoints me when people write reviews that underrate it. The bugs are realistic and frightening; and the settings are atmospheric and very Del Toro as I've been told.  All actors give good performances based on the dialogue, which actually makes sense and keeps you interested. This is a B film, but a very good one.  You probably will not suspect what is coming next, but even if you do, it will be a surprise somehow.  Del Toro does a terrific job setting up the story, and carrying it to its' finish. The only thing I have any quarrels with is about the ending, which doesn't make perfect sense, and isn't entirely realistic, but works well enough. The ending is no reason not to watch the film, because the film will have you so involved the first time around that you will not notice any flaws. I am very picky; so I will give this film 7.2 stars out of 10 on just being a good film, but 8.2 on being scary and frightening.

Then...it sort of disappeared. Finally, some time later, I came across different snippets about it, and decided to see it. And I must say, I was impressed.Mira Sorvino plays Susan Tyler, an entomologist who, three years ago, stopped an epidemic with her husband, that was passed through cockroaches. To do this, they released a breed of cockroach that would kill off the others, then die itself. Yet, it didn't die...it breeded. And the breed has grown to the size of humans--and larger. And they've mimicked their predator...man. (Okay, the literary technique is getting old, I know.) Anyhoo, Susan must return to the sewers where this breed was released, and get a specimen. But what she, and a handful of others, find, may possibly kill them and the entire city of New York. (And the world!)Okay, cheesy-as-hell description, but you get the gist of it. Anyhow, it is a very well done film. The acting is suberb, especially from Sorvino. She has a Ripley-esque quality to her and is extremely likeable. Jeremy Northam is great, as well, as Peter, her husband. Charles S. Dutton got on my nerves as the overly-stereotypical black man, foul-mouthed and eternally p***ed off. Isn't that character just a little old by now? I figured Samuel L. Jackson drained it of any interest at this point. In this, Dutton plays Leonard, the transit cop who leads the main characters through the subways for their investigation. Noteworthy also, in smaller roles, is Alix Koromzay as Remy, Susan's partner, and Josh Brolin as, aptly enough, Josh, a detective. Giancarlo Giannini as shoe-shiner Manny felt a little out of place, but was likeable. The worst character in the entire film (with Leonard in second) was Manny's autistic son Chuy (Alexander Goodwin). Not only is the kid so utterly annoying in every moment he shows up in the film, but he's a waste-of-time character, and at so many moments could have been killed off (a taboo, killing kids, I know, but be realistic) but shows up alive. By the end of the movie, you get the distinct impression no one knew what to do with him. I thought a city bus could have gone by and hit him, and not felt it was out of place. He was the biggest detriment to the film. (And the whole spoons-and-shoe-type skill of his...God, I wanted to scream!)The movie plays out quite well, with a great set-up, and for the last forty minutes, a heavy dosage of action and excitement. And what I liked was that the film didn't lose its brains. It's a terrific combination. I thought th e showdown between the final bug and Susan at the end was a little too short, but extremely tense, especially the chase towards the oncoming train (you'll see, it's terrific).Overall, I definitely recommend this film. It's extremely well done. And except for Chuy (grr), Leonard's annoying characteristics (did you not see that he would help save the others by sacrificing himself, like, two minutes into his screen time?), and the very cheesy ending (so, what, they adopt Chuy?!), I loved it. Look forward to the sequel.  "},{"Title":"Vastly overlooked horror movie....","Date":"31 October 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Mimic is extremely underated. If you expect simple, schlocky B-movie scares, look elsewhere. This is a surreal, nightmarish film with a cliched plot (scientist creates giant killer bugs in the sewers) given terrifying religious relevance. Director Del Toro is far more intrested in creating a frightening, claustophobic atmosphere than simple shocks, creating a poetic, palpable feel of utter fear throughout.   The cast all give great performances, and the script gives them all real characters to play, rather than action heroes, which there are none of in this film. The visuals are wonderful, especially the magnificent abandoned train station and the shadowy figures that lurk everywhere. For the last twenty minutes there is little dialogue, letting the pictures tell the story. Mimic is truly a brilliant film, bypassing the usual horror movie stuff to create a mythic, unforgettable experience. This rates alongside Alien (1979), The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995) as an intellectual horror/thriller.

He stages the various set-pieces with relentless energy, culminating in a hair-raising stand-off between terrified humans and a swarm of gigantic flying bugs in a disused section of the Underground.

That director is Mexico's Guillermo Del Toro, writer/director of the very impressive 1992 debut film Cronos.  Del Toro's influences come more from the British Hammer horror films and European horror directors such as Dario Argento more than from Mexican horror films, such as those starring El Santo.  I've read that Del Toro is slated to direct a film adaptation of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga Domu A Child's Dream, I'm very interested to see how that turns out.Anyone who saw Cronos will recognize a lot of Del Toro's style, and his apparent fascination with insects; but I think a lot of what made Cronos work so well is missing here it's quirky sense of humor.  Aside from a few interesting ideas, very good creature designs from master special effects artist Rob Bottin (who's previously worked with Joe Dante, John Carpenter, and Paul Verhoeven, among others), and some good cinematography, this is your basic Alien rip-off, saved from mediocrity by some very good visuals.  Most of the cast is pretty good, although I think I would've cast someone other than Mira Sorvino.

What, another? Yep. The trouble is; it's the 1950's re-visited. Except that, in those days, this sort of hokum was accepted for the B-movie status it represented. This, and one or two others, like 'Species' and 'Resident Evil' want to be A-list fodder, and they just don't cut it. There's plenty of fine tension that builds throughout the movie. There's lots of horror. And there are some wonderful subterranean set-pieces on an absolutely Gothic scale and style. Attention to detail is commendable. Trouble is, you wonder why the whole city doesn't just fall through the streets and disappear. The lead characters are rather unmemorable. And that's despite an Oscar or two between them. The script, as usual, is pretty uninspiring. The conflicts seem needlessly heavy-handed and contrived. You can see thin but choice slices of other movies popping-up from time to time, like cinematic salami, when the director runs out of ideas and finds it necessary to 'pay homage', or plagiarise, as it used to be called. Of course, the whole science half of the science-fiction premise falls apart on account of the simple fact that even insects require many generations to evolve the needful characteristics of their niche. And an insect that evolved to mimic the outline of human beings in order to get close enough for a kill would need to stalk millions - and successfully, generation upon generation, refining the advantageous characteristic down the line. They couldn't afford to let just one of us get away. We're too well organised. We'd come back in force. And Disappearances on a holocaust scale would raise lots of questions amongst those remaining. In any case; they'd start out looking very unlike humans; so we surely would spot 'em and escape, and blow the whistle. The mimicry would never be perfected before they, in turn, were hunted to extinction. Which, by-the-by, is precisely what happens. The movie shoots itself in the foot. The problem with trying to invent a dedicated predator for human beings is that we are so very, very smart as animals go. That's why we're top predator on this planet. Only diseases can get our trousers down. Which is why something like a new virus can be such a frightener. Check out Carpenter's classic 'The Thing'. Now you're talking!As an aside, consider the top-drawer movie 'Aliens'. That species could never exist in the same environment as its humanoid prey. It is too comprehensively dangerous in comparison. It would quickly wipe-out its prey and then be driven into extinction itself. Such a beastie could only be artificially designed - which, of course, it was. All predators evolve in concert with their prey. It's an ongoing arms race. But humans show that a comparatively sudden rise in intelligence can radically tilt the balance. That's why we're breeding like flies and everything else (big) is dying out.In short; mimic is NOT science-fiction, but science-fantasy.Still; it's spooky and lurid, there's lots of grubbing about in squalid places with flashlights. It's claustrophobic and tense like an 'X-file' but without the benefit of Mulder and Scully. I still think 'Them' is a lot better, minute-for-minute and script-for-script.

It's basically a monster movie!Well, it's sad you'll have to wait forty minutes to see this monster movie. Overall, the movie was decent but I really didn't care much for anything in the first half. I gotta say I like the creature design and some visual effects of the film, usual in Guillermo del Toro films, which falls short from his other great films.

His movie The devil's backbone is a good example, and Cronos is such a great debut to show the diabolic imagination of this Mexican man. But Mimic is not a Poetry piece of work or a torrent of powerful visual ideas. Mimic IS a Monsert Movie, and just that. Do not look for special backgrounds, religious stuff or subliminal messages. Mimic is a monster movie right in your face and without concessions. You see the poor kids being chomped by the giant bugs, horrible mutated bugs are cut in half by the hip spurting nasty white liquids, blood spread like jets and dripping to your face, various slimy moments and *too nasty to explain it* stuck on the walls. This is hardcore movie, with a little bit of speech about human intrusion in natural environments, but the original idea of Giant cockroaches eating people in the NY subway is too attractive to even spank it. And the performances, well, they are not an academy award worth it, but they are very believable. Charles Dutton is great as a little-bit-annoying aged cop, Mira Sorvino changes her register from Mighty Afrodita and Giancarlo Giannini is always a pleasure. My verdict Watch this movie if you are a monster movie lover, or if you are a fan of the Alien franchise. If you don't like monsters, then do not even approach this mutated blockbuster wannabe.

It's almost as if del Toro, usually a more-than-capable action/horror director, handed the project off to someone else halfway through.

As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives.That was until entomologist &#x96; bug doctor &#x96; Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process.And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings.(He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding.Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC&#x85; a lot of people though.In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish &#x96; I told you it was a Del Toro film &#x96; this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them.Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie &#x96; with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end.Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults.Final Rating &#x96; 5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick &#x96; and then deliberately diluting the creepiness &#x96; seems like an opportunity missed.

So I decided to give it another viewing and this time look at it with a more critical eye. I was quite surprised by the results; which I'll talk about after this brief summary.A disease is killing the young of New York. It is carried by the cockroaches that inhabit much of the city and so entomologist, Dr. Susan Tyler is brought in to try and solve the problem. What she comes up with is a genetically modified insect that kills the cockroaches. It's a success. We now switch to three years down the line and it seems there's something praying on the lower levels of society in the subway tunnels. Some boys bring Dr. Tyler something they have found, a young of the species she had developed to kill the cockroaches&#x85; but they were all supposed to be sterile. Her husband, Dr. Peter Mann, who works for the CDC, goes with her down into the tunnels where they boys found the insect. Can they find the colony before it spreads across the city and eventually the country? Well, I guess the Spoiler Police would be feeding me to the roaches if I told you that one.Very well made with some great cinematography and some great visual effects; the creatures were particularly good. Although nobody particularly stood out, all the performances were pretty good, so honourable mentions go to; Mira Sorvino as Dr. Susan Tyler, Jeremy Northam as Dr. Peter Mann, Alexander Goodwin as Chuy, Giancarlo Giannini as Manny, Charles S. Dutton as Leonard, Josh Brolin as Josh, Alix Koromzay as Remy and F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Gates.Although I liked the look of the film and the effects were pretty good, I still found it hard to really get into. I guess the characters didn't have enough depth for me to really engage with them and so it kind of fell a bit flat about two thirds of the way through, just when it should have been picking up! Don't get me wrong, I love much of del Toro's work, it's just this one sadly failed to hit the mark. It's certainly gory enough, so not recommended for the squeamish, and it's not entirely bad, but still it's not one, sadly, I can fully recommend.My score 5.8/10.IMDb Score 5.8/10 (based on 17,705 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 61/100 (based on 33 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score 46/100 (based on 43,507 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

I could not tell whether del Toro is atheist or Christian because of conflicting philosophical desires throughout.

That's what I like to call a film like Mimic. It's when a great visionary, Guillermo del Toro in this case, misses the mark and delivers us a flop. The ironic thing is that del Toro will admit that Mimic is his dud. He disowned this film out of shame for what it became. It was a film that got away from him and was left to the studio to ruin with their revised endings and watered down script. Guillermo del Toro is a passionate director who loves art and loves film, so more than anything I just feel sorry for him that his project escaped him and became something he resents. I suppose that is just the Hollywood way, as sad as it is.But moving on from the sad, sad tale of a man betrayed, Mimic is a sci-fi horror film about giant bugs trying to eliminate the one threat they have left, mankind. The film begins three years before present day when Dr. Susan Tyler created the Judas bug to kill off cockroaches carrying a virus that was killing children. The Judas bug was a complete success and in a way Susan saved the world. Jump ahead three years and the Judas bug as evolved into some kind of monster, adapting to the world and becoming eerily human like. It's up to Susan, her husband, and an angry black security guard to stop this exoskeletal threat.What surprised me about this film is that it is actually pretty boring. The setup is slow and dull and all the build up to the final battle against the bugs is surprisingly lackluster. I can't call this film incredibly intelligent. It has a decent storyline that sort of flat lines after setting the stage for what the film will be about. It has a dull script and sub-par actors that don't carry the film well. The first two thirds of the film just seem to amble along at a pretty dead pace, never exploding and never really grabbing hold of my attention. Things just sort of happen. They don't elicit any emotion and nothing in the beginning made me go, Wow. That was creative. For the first two acts of the film Mimic is sort of just there.The film really picks up in the last act though. The end of the film takes place in an abandoned subway station where the bugs are nesting and building their numbers. This dark and eerie set piece is the perfect place for a thrilling ending to the film. del Toro directs with a textured and visceral quality. He really knows how to capture thrills and he structures the final act of Mimic very well. There are some great moments in the mysteriously spooky underground that do well to satisfy an appetite for awesome bug versus man action. There are also numerous moments of shining creativity that remind me that I am watching a del Toro film. Those subway scenes are wonderfully imaginative and they exemplify why this is a del Toro film. It is everything else that runs awry and makes me think I'm watching another cheese eaten sci-fi from some no name Hollywood hack.I was prepared to call Mimic a so-so film that could have been a lot better. I was ready to finish out my thoughts on the movie by saying that this is a film that shines in some areas and lacks in others. I was prepared to say that it wasn't terrible, but it was certainly no masterpiece. Then the ending came along. The final two shots of the film filled me with so much frustration and aggravation that I had to resolve my opinion and call this a bad film. There were enough redeeming qualities for me to call this a decent film, but then it had to go and ruin it all with the stupidest ending imaginable. I couldn't believe it and I couldn't continue to call this a good film. It is a disappointment, overall, with only a few good things going for it. However, I have read that this wasn't the ending del Toro intended and I completely believe that. I would love to see the 100 percent del Toro rendition of Mimic, but for now we are stuck with this unfortunate losing film.

Today, this new species has mutated. It's bigger. Our size, and then some. And it hasn't gotten any less deadly. While the science of this doesn't *completely* hold up, this remains a nice cautionary tale(be careful about messing up the delicate balance of nature, you don't know what you might be causing). As a creature feature, it's about as good as they come, which is to say not very. The biggest problems here are the script with its several clichés and relative predictability(in spite of breaking rules for this kind of thing), the apparent plagiarism(one can easily compare this to Alien and its first sequel, and they come out on top) and the pacing. This spends *a lot* of time setting up characters(and granted, some of them aren't bad) that aren't going to be the focus(including that annoying Autistic spoon kid... the more we see of him, the less we care about what happens to him) and in general not getting to the part we all want to see - humans down in the subway(those places are inherently creepy) tunnels, with these beings around - for a long time. When it finally does, it rushes(to not make the running time excessive) to its climax, and the resolution is overly easy, with little struggle and a major letdown to viewers. Plausibility and logic take nosedives in the third act. It could be argued that this takes itself too seriously, there is little to no camp present. The performances range, and Sorvino's is fine for much of it. From a technical standpoint, this is great. Production values, FX, design(brought to us with the help of Rob Bottin, the man who worked his behind the scenes magic on John Carpenter's classic The Thing, as well!), lighting, cinematography and editing, all state of the art. This is impeccably well-directed; when we don't see the bug, we feel its presence, we sense it stalking. The tension and the eerie atmosphere, with effective scares(granted, there are cheap jump ones among them, but still) keep you watching closely. Del Toro(who has gone on to do films infinitely superior to this) disowned this since they took it away from him and screwed up what he wanted to do with it, and yet you can clearly tell that it is by him, and his magical touches are intact in many places(and yes, we get goo, slime and other nastiness). There is a bit of bloody violence(not a lot is graphic, and the only gore is of the non-mammals) and strong language in this. I recommend it to fans of the sub-genre and the director. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Dark, Spooky, Enjoyable But Overly Familiar Mutant Insect Takeover Movie","Date":"14 February 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" When a terrible disease carried by cockroaches creates an epidemic in New York City, a genetic scientist develops a new strain of bug to sterilise them.

He's a true artist in the literal sense; he draws and designs his films beautifully, like William Cameron Menzies or Terry Gilliam, and the look of them is sensational. Despite its contemporary urban setting, Mimic is a fantasy underworld of forgotten chambers, caverns, crawlspaces and tunnels where sewers meet underground transit, all of which look amazing. But the weakness in some of his work is an overt focus on look at the expense of characters and plot. What exactly is Strickler's Disease - Northam describes it as something akin to polio but it looks more like tuberculosis. How exactly do the Judas Breed bugs grow lungs ? And what's the point of their humanoid characteristics when they fail any kind of close inspection ? Similarly, our heroes are noble enough but not very smart or sympathetic. Despite this the cast are agreeable enough, with old pro Dutton coming off best, although at one point when asked if he has ever seen anything like this before I expected him to reply, Well, when I was based on that off-world prison colony in Alien³ &#x85; . The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent, creeping us out in all the key scenes, and the production design by Carol Spier (David Cronenberg's regular set designer) is sensational; if you have nightmares about dank dark claustrophobic spaces this is not the film for you. One aside - this film has a really irritating opening credits sequence, which I think is supposed to give us some initial storyline setup. However, it's completely unreadable, off-putting and generally annoying. It was designed by Kyle Cooper, who seems to have started this trend with his titles for Se7en. Titles should either be clear and unobtrusive, or fun (e.g. Goldeneye); frustrating the audience and giving them a headache right at the start of the film is not a good plan. There are better giant bug movies - Starship Troopers is more enjoyable, Meet The Applegates is more satirical and Naked Lunch is weirder - but this is a solid horror film nonetheless. Written by Matthew Robbins (Dragonslayer) and Del Toro, based on a story by influential sci-fi writer/publisher Donald A. Wollheim.

Apparently in this reality nobody has ever heard of chaos theory or even read/seen Jurassic Park, although it could be argued no logical mind could have actually anticipated the results here. The cockroaches adapt (of course) getting larger (okay) and developing the ability to mimic humans (really?). Thus unless our protagonist can come up with a solution quickly they will spread and takeover the world (I really wish I had made that part up).The writing is weak; it's full of clichés and has no credibility (although to be fair to the screenwriter his script may not have been followed). The initial genetic engineering premise is interesting but it quickly degenerates into things that go bump in the night and big scary bugs.The film was written and directed by the very talented Guillermo del Toro, though as a result of his struggles with his producers (the Weinstein's) he would disassociate himself from the final result.The films fairly talented cast including Sorvino, F. Murray Abraham, Giancarlo Giannini, Charles S.

For most part the movie is set in the underground abandoned subway-system of New York. It's dark, creepy, dirty looking, in other words; perfect! With a setting like this the story, characters and everything else already becomes less important. The movie also does heavily rely on its atmosphere, which makes Mimic a pleasant and good genre movie but from a great or original one as well.The movie definitely borrows heavily from other genre movies, especially in its second halve, when the movie gets quite formulaic. You can definitely see this movie as an Aliens with bugs. The movie shows more than one of two similarities in its story, atmosphere and camera-work. But its done in a good way, so the fact that the movie isn't anything renewing or original doesn't really matter. The movie serves its purpose and it does this well.The story comes definitely secondary and in fact is quite ridicules at certain points. In its core the story had some real potential but for some reason the story lines and characters never get fully developed, as if they deliberately tried to keep the movie low-key and formulaic. The movie does have its good and original moments, such as the large man-like bugs but all of its potential never gets exploited to the max.The movie does offer some scares and false-scares, which make it obvious that Guillermo del Toro is a director who understands- and can handle the genre. It's definitely not his best directed movie (accordingly this is also due to producer Bob Weinstein who made some unreasonable demands) but this early movie by him shows his talent and passion for the genre in a positive way. Definitely a director whose movies I'll always keep watching with lots of pleasure. The movie is also good looking with some early special effects that look reasonable enough, especially for 1997 standards.The movie has some good (for its genre) actors in it. Mira Sorvino might not be the best thinkable hero but it's sort of OK since the movie never fully relies on its characters and actors but on the atmosphere and its moments instead. The movie also features Josh Brolin and Giancarlo Giannini in some smaller parts and F. Murray Abraham in a redundant role.Obviously a movie for its genre fans only. It's nothing too remarkable but its good enough and serves its purpose very well.

He did a fine job most of the time, and even when the guy was really scared, while I was prepared to say this was bad acting from a bad movie, given Dutton's reputation, perhaps that was very convincing fear.Alexander Goodwin reminded me of Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man', though Hoffman is a much better actor. Chuy could recite the size and style of any shoe just by seeing it, and he did it in that meticulous way Hoffman's Raymond did, though with a more pleasant personality. From the way Chuy rocked back and forth and played the spoons and seemed out of touch, as if everything he watched was on TV, I would say he was autistic. Chuy was being raised by Manny, an older shoeshine man, whose relationship to Chuy was not made clear, unless I missed it. Perhaps Chuy's parents couldn't handle him and he was taken in by his patient grandfather. Regardless, Giancarlo Giannini did a wonderful job with the role, and Manny's love for the boy was clear.Other actors played their roles well, I'm sure, but these were just the ones that made the strongest impression for me.The intelligence shown by the major characters in solving their various problems made this more than just an average sci-fi movie.I'm not one to recommend a movie of this type, but it did have these positive qualities.

They are all fiction and no science. Every now and then someone manages to do a movie that´s pure sci-fi, but feels more science than fiction. If all the sci-fi movies were 100% realistic they wouldn´t be that fun to watch. Creating dinosaurs from DNA is totally impossible, but Steven Spielberg´s Jurassic Park was still great. On the other hand, Armageddon was a horrible movie that was so fiction that it made me sick. You get the picture.Biology, especially genetics, is a very popular subject in modern sci-fi movies. People read about genes in newspapers and hear how they´re used to create genetically-manipulated plants and animals. Then they see Hollywood movies which throw every natural thing out of the window and make up their own laws and facts. It´s okay if you recognize the mistakes, but if you absorb every fact from these movies you are in trouble. I kind of enjoy watching stupid movies dealing with biology because it´s fun to search for all the mistakes and plot holes.In Mimic we have bugs that mimic human beings. The bugs have been genetically-modified as they were created to kill the carrier of a dangerous virus. The bugs were not supposed to reproduce, but surprise surprise, those little creatures found a way to evolve into huge mega bugs that mimic and kill Homo sapiens, their creator. Okay, that´s not very realistic. It sounds a bit stupid, too. It took three years for the small beetles to evolve into bigger-than-man monsters... That couldn´t happen in three years which is a very short period of time as far as evolution is concerned. And the whole mimicing thing doesn´t sound very sensible.But that doesn´t matter. You can´t watch this movie and expect science-fact. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Mimic. It´s an entertaining B-movie with a surprisingly good cast and scary-enough atmosphere. It actually feels more like a small-budget indie. The bugs itself look a bit comical and I think that they shouldn´t have shown them at all, until the very end, of course.

I found at least part of the explanation here on IMDb After repeated on-set changes by the producer, Bob Weinstein, del Toro apparently disowned the film. Still, his name is up there as Director, so he can't escape all the blame.All the usual horror ingredients are here the dark, cluttered, brooding sets; the blink-and-you'll-miss-'em split-second shadowy glimpses of the creatures; the monstrous jaws trailing strands of slime as they open; the cute young heroine who is also a world-class scientist (and, of course, half of the love-interest subplot); and so on. The problem is not that any of this stuff is done badly; it's that everything has been done before (and since). That is not what one expects from Guillermo del Toro. I've seen all his full-length films; some, such as Pan's Labyrinth, are in my opinion among the best movies every made, and even the least serious of them, Pacific Rim, shows an ingenuity and attention to detail that pull it out of the comic-book film category and make it something special.

To cure a plague, a race of genetically-altered cockroaches are released in the sewers of New York City.  The plague is cured, and the cockroaches are assumed to have run out their pre-determined lifespan.  Naturally, quite the opposite turns out to be true, as the protagonists discover the roaches have evolved into gigantic killing machines.  And not only are they efficient killers, they also can fold their carapace to appear more human-like.How did this happen?  Through the miracle of evolution, according to the scientists.  Okay, but in just three years?  Yes, say the scientists, as insects they can go through millions of generations every year.  And this is where things get silly.First, we are shown multiple scenes of the roaches in action they are larger than human, wielding scimitar-like claws, and flying circles around their prey.  Does such a creature really need to blend in to get its job done?  Second, evolution doesn't produce mimicry just because it seems like a good idea.  There has to be a well-established advantage, and usually a close relationship between the mimic and the thing mimicked.  The roaches wouldn't start looking like humans until there was significant contact between the two, and a significant disadvantage (say, death) to those that didn't look human.  And yet, there's no mention of them ever having been seen before, and as was noted earlier, humans aren't much of a match regardless of how the roaches look.It would be easy to overlook these flaws if there was something else to like in Mimic, but there truly isn't.  We are encouraged to sympathize with the main protagonists because they have trouble conceiving a child; then at the end, it is suggested sloppily that they will become guardians of an autistic orphan.  This all occurs while we're still trying to figure out how the male protagonist survived the explosion he was just at the center of, which destroyed the extensive roach nest in its entirity. (Apparently, he fell into some water.)  Although the scenes in the nest are somewhat interesting, the movie as a whole is not engaging.

Director Guilleramo Del Toro has fun with it, which is fitting since he made Cronos. The special effects are the film's best asset although they never distract from the fact that we have seen variations of them in better films. Sorvino is way too talented for such flat material. At one point she is abducted by one of the creatures, but in theory, it was probably preventing her from fleeing the set. Among flat supporting players are Jeremy Northam, Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton and they are basically there to play lunch on the menu for these creatures to dine upon. F. Murray Abraham is an Oscar winner and seeing him reduced to this is painful.

This would produce so much glare for the wearer that he/she would not be able to see anything outside.

Many films featuring people in some sort of suit suffer from this flaw, but by no means all of them do, and it is to the credit of the director when he can arrange exterior lighting to do the job.The film is full of inexcusably bad science and bad acting. It is not, as has been suggested, a barefaced promotion of Evolution; only a guilt-ridden creationist would think so. The plot has been shamelessly lifted from many other creature films, most notably, Aliens. Where are all the copyright police when there's really something for them to do?

Dutton in director Guillermo Del Toro's claustrophobic horror opus Mimic, a verminously boring piece of skullbuggery, that takes itself too seriously to have any camp value much less scare merit. While the bugs look convincing enough when you can see them, they don't make the skin at the back of your neck crawl. Only somebody whose never screamed at a horror movie would have to sleep with their lights on with a can of Reid insecticide under their pillow after suffering through Mimic. A pestilent epidemic spread by cockroaches is killing children by the hundreds in New York city when a group of scientists led by entomologist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) create a genetic mutant called the Judas Breed. They have manufactured a super cockroach in their labs that can kill other cockroaches, but these little buggers cannot reproduce themselves and have a life expectancy of six months. At least, that's what Susan Tyler and Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam of The Net) thought. The Judas Breed eradicates the cockroach plague and spares a generation of children. Everybody breathes a sight of relief, while deep within those abandoned New York subway tunnels, a specimen has somehow managed to survive and breed. Three years later, out it comes to feed and its favorite lunch morsel is human.Mann tracks these vicious critters into the subway catacombs with the help of Leonard, a grumpy subway cop (the ever reliable Charles S. Dutton), who doesn't have a clue (like most characters in horror movies) what he's gotten himself into as the scientist's tour guide. Meanwhile, Susan finds herself alone in a subway when a bug snatches her up and flies off with her. Miraculously, the critter doesn't chomp her like it does its previous victims. In fact, other than flying off with her, the bug leaves her intact, dumping her in its slime. Eventually, Susan scrambles through the maze of tunnels and finds Peter. So do a swarm of the bugs. Our heroes hole up in a subway car. Just as the bugs are about to tear their way inside and eat these human sardines, Susan figures out that the bugs can smell their blood. She gets everybody to smear themselves with dead bug guts, and they leave them momentarily alone. Talk about repellent! The premise that Mimic neglects to explain is how these mutants found a way to replicate themselves and take the general shape and appearance of a man huddled up in a trench coat. Gifted scenarists such as John (Lone Star) Sayles, Matthew (Dragonslayer) Robbins, and Steven (Kafka) Soderbergh contributed to writer-director Guillermo (Cronos) Del Toro's heavily derivative script, but none of them seems to have worked the bugs out of their roachy script. Mimic appears to mimic The Lost World in two respects. The Mimic scientists overlook the possibility that their genetic deviants could survive in the wild like The Lost World dinosaurs, and one of the film's better set-pieces shamelessly rips-off the RV scene in Lost World, but with considerably less suspense or tension. The only sweat that you will break in Mimic is waiting for director Del Toro and his writers to scare you.Despite this surfeit of talent, Mimic stinks because the filmmakers wait too long to flush out the bugs. They waste over forty-five minutes setting up the story before our heroes descend into the subway tunnels. Of course, you can guess when who is going to die, so predictability paralyzes the story. Worse than that is that director Guillermo Del Toro rarely conjures up anything that remotely terrifies. There are too few instances when you want to jump because something on screen shocked you. The scene where the huge roach scoops up Mira Sorvino and swoops off with her is hilarious. It's like those silent movies where the eagle carries the hero off to its nest. Del Toro is good at showing us lots of yucky bug slime and the bugs themselves. Most of the movie is shot in darkness so that you cannot see the bugs until the movie is half-way over. As for the bugs, the cockroaches in Joe's Apartment were more fun. Mimic's villainous bugs simply don't look as murderous as either an alien or as creepy as an anaconda, even when one crawls over one of our heroes. When these buggers run, they resemble the raptors from The Lost World, but they are far less tenacious or terrifying.Nothing in this handsomely produced insect epic will peg your blood pressure. A good cast is wasted, especially F. Murray Abraham, and we care so little about these one dimensional characters that when they begin to drop like flies, who cares. The filmmakers ignore whatever potential that they might have stirred up by having bodacious Mira Sorvino strip-tease a la Sigourney Weaver and lure the roaches to their demise. Charles Dutton's subway cop comes closest to enlisting our sympathies because he gets to curse loudly and bug out his own eyes when he sees the giant insects. There's an expendable subplot, too, about a small boy who gets lost in the tunnels and befriends the bugs. Skip this bugger.

And it's quite a shame to, as I have loved all of del Toro's other films; from the action packed comic book adaption Hellboy to the mystical masterpiece that is Pans Labyrinth. Now I was hoping the film Mimic, would kick-start my interest back into creature-feature films, how wrong I was. While the film does deliver some impressive and new takes on the genre, it does unfortunately seem rather bland and failed to mesmerize me.The film is essentially about mutant bugs running amok in the subways of New York killing and eating who ever they can get there hands on. Now they weren't always like this. These bugs were once genetically modified cockroaches. They were released into sewer systems around the city to kill of cockroaches that were spreading disease and killing the cities children. What was supposed to happen is the bugs were to die after six months and leave no offspring as they had been bug castrated. Now like all other films of the genre. This doesn't happen and it's up to the bugs creator; Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) and her partner (and lover) Dr peter Mann (Jeremy Northam), to stop them from consuming the entire city.There are many reasons for this. First of all as previously stated the film hosts a squirming and menacing evil other then the mutated insects who serve as antagonists for this flick, and they are clichés. Now like most horror movies (in particular modern films) Mimic provides a host for clichés that really distract and bury any enjoyment of the film. These clichés are so noticeable they are almost laughable. For example we have a character sticking her hand in a dark place and pulling it out before she is attacked by a creature- cliché number one. We have the scientist whose creation (the insects in the film) intended for good, revolt and attack humanity- cliché number two. Now I could go on but the majority of the most prominent clichés occur at the climax of the film, and believe me you will know what they are. Not only the clichés pose a problem for del Toro's first Hollywood picture, but also illogical science.Now this might not be a problem for all viewers, but it is for me (a bit of a science lover). Now we are led to believe that the bugs evolved from being bite sized cockroaches to mammoths of the insect kingdom in about four years. Now the film attempts to explain this by claiming that in evolution changes occur over generations not years. While this may be true it is not only the factor. The other is selection pressures. Now these are the factors that influence change. For the creatures to become that big there must be a reason for it. Now cockroaches and insects are small for a reason; there prey is small and hence so are they. Now the sewers in which these insects live should be loaded with small play, hence the insects should remain small and definitely not increase in size, as large size would not be selected for in an environments will small prey. Hence despite being genetically engineered this really impossible, even in a movie sense.Now enough of the negatives, thankfully the film contains some positives that to a degree prevent the film from being a disaster. The creatures in the film look amazing- del Toro's brilliant imagination comes to life through there design. Now these creatures look like cockroaches except they have the ability to mimic humans. What they do is parts of their exoskeleton fold over their body to look like a rather intimidating and powerful human. Such an adaptation allows for the creatures to hunt for humans on the surface. I must say this really is a refreshing surprise compared to the ordinary giant critters most horror films contain. But unfortunately it is not enough to save this film.One more positive to note is the acting, which surprisingly is above average, not great but not poor either. The actors such as Northam and Giancarlo (who plays a shoe shiner Manny) provide good performances. There response to nearly being eaten by bugs really is believable and both of them were able to behave scared and at times strong without over reacting.Unfortunately these positives cannot save this film from being a sub-par horror film. Overall I give the film a 4.7/10. Now a word for the parents, the film is actually relatively low on blood and gore for a horror. Despite its R rating in the US, only two scenes show significant amounts of blood, and only one of which actually shows a bloody human wound. Hence it is more appropriate for younger audiences then most modern horror films (even a few PG-13 films). So anyone at the age of 11and older should be fine with the movie.

A nice basis for a film - genetically modified insects are introduced into the sewers of New York to kill off cockroaches that are spreading a virus which in turn is killing hundreds of children. But the execution of the film, which depicts the horrific results when good old mother nature kicks in and ensures that the genetically time-bombed killer insects live, breed and mutate, is poor and disjointed. Add this poorly executed idea with actors unable to liven up a so-so script and characters you hope will be killed off sooner rather than later and you have, what for me at least, is the perfect bedtime horror film - it sends you to sleep.At least I can rent Mimic 2 when I next have insomnia!

The entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (the gorgeous Mira Sorvino) decides to release some mutants' cockroaches with modified DNA to exterminate the bugs and programmed to not reproduce themselves. However, this life form evolutes and becomes a bigger threaten to human race. Dr. Susan, together with her husband, a subway guard and a shoe repairman will fight against these mutations. This is a surprisingly good horror B-movie. It keeps tension along the whole story. However, it is not recommended for viewers with trouble with cockroaches and with weak stomachs. My vote is seven.

I  nearly had to handcuff myself to the seat to keep myself in the theatre. The movie seemed to have a solid foundation in plot, but when put on film ended up being little more than a heap of seemingly unrelated shots. The scene of the film's star Mira Sorvino in a laboratory late at night simply serves to illustrate this. Less than 10 minutes later, she's racing around abandoned subway tunnels looking for overgrown cockroaches. When the male lead (Jeremy Northam) finds himself in the enemies lair, conveniently with a main gas line, he decides to blow himself up. The ensuing explosion is powerful enough to undoubtedly destroy any egg sacs that are hundreds of feet away, but by diving into a foot of water, Northam is able to walk out with no more than singed clothing .

The storyline in general, is nothing but an evolution tale. If you can ignore that, the movie offers some legitimate thrills and chills. The special-effects are excellent and when the flying cockroaches take off, it's jaw-dropping to watch. Outstanding rear-speaker surround sound adds to the excitement. This was good demo for DVD back in '99.Politics aside, it's a suspenseful thriller. "}]
