The film works as a horror film because of that concept, but this film and the story writer behind it believe that paybacks are a bitch. Retribution is always around the corner and when it is your time, you don't know if it is going to from a guy in a hockey mask, a massive great white shark,a 58 red and white Plymouth Fury, some idiot with long finger knives or a lovable Saint Bernard.  Whatever it is though, sin always accounted for.  Cujo subscribes to that theory.Everyone that dies in this film, with the exception of maybe one, does so because they are not very likable people to begin with.  They are all tainted and when Cujo gets a hold of them, we are almost glad that he wants their blood.  But it is the climax of the film that is the most intriguing. Because here we have a woman who has gotten rid of her sin.  But she now has to face the music not for what she is doing, but for what she has done. And if you read the book, you will see that it sticks to that theory and message much more than the film does.  It is understood that Cujo has to have a happy Hollywood ending, and that is fine, but the book tells a much more clear yet paradoxically convoluted tale of a boy, his dog, and how sin is never really forgiven.What is also great about Cujo is how it shows the dog coming unravelled. We see the transformation from lovable suck of a family dog, to vicious killing machine that has an insatiable need for blood.  We see his nose get more wet, we see how certain noises bother him more and we see how much saliva this dog has stored up in his nasty mouth.Cujo is a good movie.  It is scary, especially the last half hour and it actually has a point.  It also does a fairly good job of bringing King's vision to life.  It is not easy to do that, after all King has a very vivid imagination.  But Cujo comes close.

It's very frightening and very underrated, and for most of the movie, there is no sign that it is a horror movie. However, Cujo is very frightening, mainly because these kind of things do happen, a lot of people (kids in particular) are bitten by dogs every day. The leading lady of 80's horror movies, Dee Wallace Stone, plays a woman who is trapped in her car with her 5 year old son, as a rabid St. Bernard terrorises them. The tension in Cujo takes a long time to build up, but when it starts, it never lets up. Under no circumstances should young kids watch this movie, they'll be wetting their beds for weeks. 7.5/10.

People really do get killed by rabid dogs...this film just exaggerates the truth a bit. I can't say I really enjoyed this film as it is not what I look for in horror films. It's a very good film - well acted, well directed, suspenseful and emotional, but it's not really fun to watch. It starts off with the dog getting infected, and from then on tension is built up slowly as you sense the dog is getting angrier and angrier. Eventually it snaps and starts killing people. The bulk of the film focuses on when Donna and her son are trapped in the broken down car because Cujo attacks whenever they try to leave. You can feel all the desperation, pain and isolation of Donna and her son as they lay trapped inside. It makes you think twice about dogs and certainly what you would do in such a situation. Would you run, attack the dog, or wait until help arrives? This is not a fun, campy or cheesy horror film, so don't watch if you're a fan of cheese. It's for those who want to feel suspense, fear and pain.

Which, it turns on its owner and also terrorises that of a unfaithful women and her son that came to get their vehicle repaired, but only to be trapped in their broken down car with rabid dog outside trying to get to them.Beethoven&#133; yep, I just couldn't stop thinking of the lovable Beethoven when watching this flick. That was one of my childhood favourites, but I guess it isn't going to be quite the same when I come across it again. I won't look a Beethoven the same way again. Anyhow, this is one of the King's better-made adaptations. Although, it's a long way from brilliant, it delivers a stable amount of interest and tension to proceedings. This was my second viewing of it and it has hardly lost any of that full-blooded impact it generated, especially the heart racing standoff between the dog and the trapped victims. I wouldn't be surprise that you don't think your watching a horror film to begin with, as the opening basis centres around a family melodrama, raising martial issues and work commitments. It kind of comes across as cheesy in its supposed sentiment in those moments. Then it kicks into gear with the slow beginning making way for a crackerjack final 40 minutes of simple confined tension built around isolation. It also doesn't hold back on the vicious dog attacks with ample ferocity and raw suspense being belted out. Watching people being mauled apart by this giant scuffed up dog wasn't that pleasant at all. The gore effects were more than adequate and it looked the part of a rabid dog perfectly. But you couldn't help but feel sorry for the dog, as it's more of a victim then the people who he's terrorising. Honestly I cared more for the misunderstood pooch than the initial victims. The characters weren't entirely likable, with the exception of one or two, but I didn't connect with them in this mess. The story is simple and plays it straight, but that doesn't mean it avoids the familiar clich√©s. Although, it doesn't entirely hurt the film, well it kind of enhances it actually. A surprising factor I found was that the film's camera-work was well choreographed with plenty of swirling shots and when it needed to up the ante it became rather erratic to fit in with the mood. Also add in some glorious slow-mo. The score on the other hand I thought was forcefully unbalanced and didn't fit into the mood at times. The performances are all sturdy and very hard to knock. Dee Wallace-Stone was at the top of her game as the wayward wife and Danny Pintauro as her worried son was equally so. Daniel Hugh Kelly gives a likable performance as the father and of course the endearing dog is worth a mention too. The strong performances make this traumatic experience even more believable.A tautly constructed and work-man like film that won't push the boundaries, but its intensely petrifying in its simple origins.

This film benefits greatly from a powerful story with some well fleshed-out characters, it's much more than just another 'animal attacks' movie. Teague's direction is also very tight and helps to build an unnerving tension through out this film. The atmosphere is very heated, the look of the movie very gritty, and the danger feels all the more real! The camera work is also excellent and makes this film feel truly claustrophobic! It builds to a finale that is heart-stopping. The music score is harrowing and the filming locations are good.Cast-wise the film is quite strong too. The great Dee Wallace delivers an emotionally powerful performance as a mother desperate to protect her child and survive herself. Young Danny Pintauro is great as Wallace's horrified child. The supporting cast is good too, as are the numerous St. Bernard's that play our vicious title character.Cujo is a top-notch suspense film that never loses its edge.

The dog is not entirely unsympathetic, either, as we are given the reasons for his mental and physical state.The film has a refreshing, picturesque simplicity and, by virtue of its shorter form, cuts away the lengthy novel's fat and improves on the premise, getting us to the jeopardy quicker and keeping us there.The original poster, which depicted a distant farmhouse on a hill, may not have sold tickets, but it was a stunning piece of creative understatement.

I wondered excitedly how they would accurately depict the intricate and emotional lives of the 8 or so main characters. After watching the movie I can say with confidence that they failed to do the job.First off - many of the characters that are quite prominent in the novel and add to the intensity and suspense are given nothing but slight cameos in the movie, or are not shown at all. The Camber family, composed of Joe, wife Charity, and son Brett, might collectively have 25 lines which is ridiculous. Roger Breakstone, Sheriff Bannerman, Gary Pervier, George Meara and Steve Kemp as characters with clear motives and reactions in the novel, are all about as deep as paper in the film. Aunt Evvie Chambers, Holly and her family, and a few other minor characters have been omitted from the film completely.If this wasn't bad enough, the main story was altered drastically, and there was no falling action whatsoever! * SPOILER ALERT *Tad Trenton lives in the movie! This huge change in plot completely takes away from the tragedy that Stephen King so wonderfully wrote. Also, Cujo is shot in the end. This quick, seemingly painless death allows the film to end quickly but totally ruins it. In the novel, the long, painful, graphic death of Cujo is, in a sense, justice being served. In the film there is no such thing.Ultimately, this film is weak, not scary, and does not stay true to the novel. I had to read the novel in broad daylight because of how frightening it was, I watched the movie alone, in the dark, at night. The film is the terrible, shameful younger brother - nay - cousin of the original novel.

In 'Christine' we have a psychotic car that went round killing people whereas in 'Cujo' we have a rabid dog going round killing people. Sadly, like 'Christine' this film is effective in parts, but it has an awful lot of problems....For me the first half of the film is where Cujo is at its weakest and that's mainly down to the fact that it's so tedious; the kid says he's got monsters in his room...OK, would have been alright if there was any point to it? We're then told that the husband (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is head of an advertising company for Sharp's who promote cereals amongst other things, but then the company are seemingly brought to their knees by an allegation that their cereals have caused internal haemorrhaging to several individuals, but then this is found to be false. If it's been proved to be untrue, why go to pieces and disappear for 10 days to sort it out? Just sue the media. As a result of his self-absorbent behaviour his wife (Dee Wallace) ends up having an affair in possibly one of the most tedious aspects of the first half of the film. It's also interesting that no-one seems concerned by the bite mark on Cujo's nose which resulted in his rabies - didn't anyone think to get him checked out by a vet?I must admit the only thing that really held my interest in the first half of the film was wondering when Cujo would attack and here the writers dangle lots of carrots and then eventually decide to let Cujo loose which thankfully is when the film starts to pick up. Once Cujo goes nuts and when the wife (Dee Wallace) and the son Tad (Danny Pintauro) are isolated and Cujo is stalking them I have to admit that these moments are quite effective and do give the film some intensity, despite the intensity there are some problems in the second half....We're not given a clear indication of how long wife and son are stranded for so this aspect is open to speculation, but I know that it's light and dark on at least one occasion which begs the question does Cujo never sleep? Even if he's rabid surely he'd be hungry and would go and look for food elsewhere? It also requires a lot of suspension of disbelief to believe that a 9 stone woman can fight off a 20 stone dog, yet on three separate occasions, three fully grown men were unable to do this? Then wifey bashes Cujo six times across his head with a baseball bat which seemingly doesn't affect him - I know St Bernard's are big dogs, but at best it would have knocked him out and at worst it would have killed him. Cujo's re-appearance from the dead at the end was just lazy and predictable and rounded off just how bad this film was.If you're the sort of person who just wants a bit of excitement and edge of your seat antics and can suspend a lot of disbelief then you'll find the second half of the film enjoyable. However, the first of the film for me was intolerably dull and although the second half was better, for me, it was still too sloppy and clich√©d to make up for the poor first half.

It's basically about a dog that gets rabies, and a mother and her son are trapped in the middle of nowhere (in their car that broke down, of all things) because the dog is terrorizing them. It's really pretty sad actually, because they show the dog chasing the rabbit into the cave where he gets the rabies, and the dog just seems so sweet and cute. It's pretty scary too, when the boy passes out from the heat in the car and needs water or SOMETHING. It obviously set that kind of situation for movies like Panic Room and Signs. It is really a pretty suspenseful movie with that psychological terror--it would scare the hell out of you if it happened to you.

There are some pretty traumatic scenes involving a young boy watching some pretty grisly events unfold before his eyes (hopefully the young actor didn't require too much counselling to get over them!), but, one the whole, there are too many sub-plots that are simply there to fill time because just having one angry dog isn't enough to fill an entire film.Not bad in parts, but you may have to keep your eyes open through some of the 'non dog's dinner scenes.'

It's about a sweet St. Bernard dog that turns nasty after a bat bites the big canine. After the dog turns completely evil, he terrorizes everybody in sight. This includes a woman and her young son who drive up to the house (where Cujo lives) to have her car fixed (Cujo's master is an auto mechanic). Not one person is in sight, and when Cujo shows up, the once friendly dog traps the two in their car and then viciously tries to break in. To make matters worse, the car stalls and refuses to start. Cujo does have a few laughable situations and there's a little stupidity thrown in at times, but overall this is a very effective horror film that did frighten me many times. Dee Wallace Stone (E.T.) and Danny Pintauro (TV's Who's the Boss?) are very good as the mother and son who's little trip to get the car fixed turns into a nightmare.

Donna Trenton is a mistreated homemaker wife subtly evident to this is how much money her husband Vic makes and yet he drives a Jaguar and she drives a broken down Pinto and she regularly has to run errands with their--younger than 6 yr old--son, Tad. What a creep! She carries on a vindictive affair with his best friend, Steve. Despite what she did is probably more wrong than what he did, most wives that felt that they were desirable enough to have an affair and married to a man like that would be doing just that. She probably should have let Vic know what she was feeling first(even though, it should have been obvious to him); that way, she has communicated and made a record to him. Anyway, as I said, Donna drives a Pinto that is in such bad shape that it could stall any time she tries to start it. Instead of Vic getting the car repaired by professionals or getting his wife a new car, he checks into servicing the car at Joe Camber's country home. At this first visit, their dog(and same breed as the dog Beethoven), Cujo, shows just what gently kind of dog he is by playing with Camber's son and little Tad. Some changes are on the horizon for Cujo, as due being bitten by a rabid bat and the huge size of Cujo, he gradually becomes an unpredictable monster from gentle to even little kids to a readily aggressive, serial killer. The change becomes complete about the time that Camber's wife decides to visit family and takes her son(Cujo's only stabilizer) with her. Meanwhile, Vic finds circumstantial evidence of Donna and Steve's affair, then she admits it in an awkward moment. Vic(instead of seeing his issues and talking it out) leaves in a kind of vindictive, self-righteous anger. He leaves Donna to handle business with Camber herself. Cujo has killed Joe and his friend since the Camber's wife left. So, there is no one nearby when Donna and Tad come rolling in. Donna confronts a 180¬∞ different dog than Tad played with on his first visit. He even gets to where he just attacks Donna or the Pinto with every movement or sound. That is, until a police officer comes out, as result of Vic possibly developing a conscience or missing his wife--trying to find the whereabouts of his wife. The dispatched cop doesn't know to expect Cujo and is killed by the time he knows what is going on. Tad's natural allergies to monsters have also turned to shock with real life monster Cujo attacking his mother and the Pinto and the hopelessness of the car not starting. Donna is getting more and more desperate with the worsening Tad. Anyway, Donna has tried unsuccessfully at least twice to reach the Camber's house and phone. That will change; watch to see how.

Cujo is one of Stephen King's better adaptations, the other being The Dead Zone. At the time back in 1983 I owned a Dachshund, and watching Cujo was off limits due to the story. I was the same way with Pet Sematary, I was able to finally watch both of them after my dog passed in 1986.Cujo is a basic story, it's about a lovable St. Bernard who contracts rabies. It involves two dysfunctional families The Cambry's and The Trenton's. The story is great, but this movie is not for those with weak stomachs due to some of the gore. It also has a sub story in it where were Donna Trenton(Dee Wallace Stone) is having an affair, with Steve( Christoper Stone); and Vic Trenton(Daniel Hugh Kelly) finally finds out. The problem I had with watching this movie is seeing Cujo go though the different stages of rabies. I know it's a movie but I'm a dog lover ; and watching dogs suffer is tough. If you want to find a great movie based on a Stephen King Adaption I would check out these hits, The Shinning, The Dead Zone; and Cujo.

Was kinda sure the dog parts will be bad. Little i knew. I must confess, i have a big fear of dogs. This might have influence the impact this movie had on me. The plot is based on Stephen King's novel, Cujo. It's the story of a dog that's getting bit by an bat, gets rabies, and act ultra- violent. We're not talking about your little bulldog here, we're talking about 100 kg bad ass St. Bernard. The dog is fabulous. I don't know details about him, who trained that dog, how scenes we're made, as there have been used some artificial dog parts, for sure, but it's damn scary. The make-up, his actual acting, are great. He's cute when he needs to, and he's a mean beast after he gets infected. My only problem with the movie is the first part. There is too much character development going on. It really feels like your everyday 80s family movie. You get to care about two characters, but is too much development going on for others, that you won't care too much about. Kinda pointless. I think this might be a reason for the low rating. But the second part of the movie, after the family problems disappear, it's a terrifying and effective ride. It is effective mostly because it is a believable situation. Directing is good. Especially for the second part. First part is kinda banal. In second part, we get some nice shots and camera work. Not so happy with shaky cams during attacks, but they are not so long. I think it was more of an practical need for those, as you can't really train the dog to actually bite and you don't wanna leave your viewers seeing your fake dog head. Acting is great too, both Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro do a great job. In second part, that's where you actually get to really care about them. Not so much in first part. You kinda forget that beginning. The kid is acting so good, and it's parts are written very good, as there always is a connections between the two. Great movie in my opinion.

You would think that this is just your average nature run-amok movie, but it actually leans a lot more towards a tense thriller for a large chunk of the movie. It's not really about a body count as much as it is about getting you to the same mental state as the victims in the film. There is a long stretch of the story where our main characters Donna and her son Tad are trapped inside their car while Cujo is outside. I really felt that it captured the fear, the claustrophobia and the anxiety that the characters were feeling. They are facing constant threats from the inside and outside of the vehicle and as more time passes, the threats just keep getting bigger and bigger so there's a real sense of escalation and suspense as the film goes along. The makeup effects on Cujo successfully transform the harmless looking St Bernard into a credible threat and the performances (even from young Danny Pintauro) are convincing.

It's a pretty scary film.","Date":"20 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" I don't know, what some critics were thinking when saying Cujo is not as menacing or frightening as other film adaptations of author Stephen King's popular stories. It's pretty damn scary! It's a better film than films like 1983's Christine & 1986's Maximum Overdrive, combined. Director Lewis Teague did unleashed a semi good horror movie into the screen and it's a bit overlooked. It had some bite with its bark. I remember seeing this film when I was a kid, and being very afraid of the huge St. Bernard. It was like if the dog, Beethoven got rabid. It's a scary thought of a family pet turning against the owners. Unlike the other horrors novels, that go deep into the supernatural and fantasy genre. This film, portrays something that could honestly happen. Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, the movie tells the story of a mother, Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) whom wants to get her car fixed, only to find herself with her son, Tad (Danny Pintauro) trapped in a car, when the neighborhood friendly family dog, Cujo becomes crazed and started killing people after being bitten by a rabid bat. I think, some people give this movie a bad rating, due to that reason, that it's feeding into the hype that certain dog breeds are dangerous. Yes, it's a bit prejudice and ignorance to think of all St. Bernard are evil, but to claim that the movie is too far fetch to be taken serious is an understatement. There has numeral cases of dogs turning against their owners. Yes, abuse, hunger and poor breeding play most of the factors to those accidents happening, but ruthless behaviors coming from normal well-kept dogs, do happen as well. Dogs do bite and dogs could kill you if they wanted to. They are indeed animals, no matter how tame they can seem. You do have to suspense disbelief, somewhat because the movie makes Cujo look something out like a monster. It's like 1993's Sandlot, in the humorous ways, they make Cujo look more than a normal dog through means like puppetry, forced perspective and a guy in dog costume. Still, some shots were pretty good, like the JAWS like animal point of view shots and how they show that loud sounds hurt Cujo. The movie does show how rabies does in fact lead to behavior changes in animals, but a rabid dog would either be hyperactive or lethargic, not super-crazed. This is a lethal disease that would cause the dog to be weaker and weaker, by the time, the Trenton family comes into play. A rabid dog is more likely to attack humans when prone, but it's normally it is too weak to be, even that vicious. It wouldn't have the strength to kill multiple people. Most rabid dogs would not be a killer like Cujo. Still, there's always going to be a slim chance that your dog will turn on you. But the odds of this are so astronomical that to be honest, I would not worry about it. It rarely happen. This movie shouldn't stop people, from buying St. Bernard. Most of them, are truly friendly. It was genuine problem in the making of the film because they simply could not get the St. Bernard to act aggressively. They had to replace him with a cunningly disguised Rottweiler for several crucial scenes, and tape his tail to his leg so he didn't wag it constantly. Large breed dogs like St. Bernard perfectly stable if purchased from a reputable breeder or pound. As long as you meet the requirements of taking care of the breed, this movie shouldn't stop you from buying dogs like that. One thing that I love about the film, is the sense of Man Vs Nature. Thank God, Stephen King didn't add the supernatural into it. The original novel was supposed to be a sequel of sorts following Stephen King 1983's The Dead Zone, in which a previous dead serial killer character, kind of bogeyman, supposedly haunted Tad and possessed Cujo to kill him. I just glad, it never came about, in the film version. I do like how Cujo stakes his prey, as if a Lion or a wolf, waiting for the right moment to attack. You really get the race against time, as conditions inside the car, become more and more unbearable, as heatstroke and dehydration, starts to kick in. The only thing, I kinda hate about the film is how annoying, the child is. The way, he's scream is ear-bleeding. It's super loud. It's doesn't help that the kid is nearly ten year old, yet, he acts like a useless toddler. How lame! He could do more, to help his mother. He was just a burden to watch. He's way too sensitive. I just wish, the movie had the same ending for the kid as the novel. One thing, I didn't like is the sub-plot that the novel had, about Donna cheating on her husband. It never added much to the story. The movie also brings it in, to help push the story, on why the police couldn't find, Donna and the kids, but the movie doesn't give us a conclusion on what happen to the Trenton's marriage. It ends with a cliffhanger note. The same, goes with the Camber family. They go away, for plot reasons, so Donna and the kids can be stuck with the dog, most of the film, but still, you would have thought, they would be used for the big climax, but no, they don't return. The movie would have, more depth, if Bret (Billy Jayne) was the one that had to take his own dog down. It would have been a great Old Yeller type of an ending. Sadly, it never came. Overall It's a dog eat dog world out there and Cujo indeed deserve another look. Like me, you're be really surprise, how good, it was.

It is a one of the best horror movie classic films ever made due to the fact something like this is a possibility - not likely to happen just like the movie but the threat of being bitten by a rabid animal is something that can happen and has happened to some people and beloved pets.Rabies is not a joking matter - and maybe this is what makes Cujo such a powerful film.

Which spells bad news for Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) and her young son Tad (Danny Pintauro), who have the misfortune to be stuck in a battered old Pinto that has broken down in Cujo's territory.Lewis Teague directs with no little skill here, wringing out pot loads of tension and inserting genuine moments of terror as mother and son literally fight for their lives. There's a school of thought that the film's first half could have been trimmed, for this is the area that defines the Trenton's as a family.Donna has been having an affair and her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh- Kelly) has found out, so for forty minutes we are investing in family strife and foundation building of the key characters. This is judged perfectly, because once Cujo is unleashed on Donna and Tad, it throws up a number of emotional connections to not only the humans, but also the dog as well.Wallace and Pintauro are excellent, providing the film with its beating heart as they prove to be a believable mother & son pairing. Teague meanwhile uses some invention with his camera work, though never to the detriment of claustrophobic terror. Elements of the source novel have been left out, while the ending - unfortunately in this viewer's opinion - has been changed, but this is a tightly wound horror and it's well due re-evaluation in this day and age of franchise sequels and remakes.Could have done with more of those bats though, they are awesome! 8/10 "},{"Title":"Old Yeller redux...","Date":"7 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" It irks me when a filmmaker arbitrarily changes the ending of a story just to give their movie a happy ending.

He ends up going on a shooting spree at the end of the story. THAT'S why I chose to plunk down my hard-earned cash when the movie version came out. But Columbine (or one of the many other school shootings) had happened between the publishing of the story and the release of the movie, so the movie simply dropped the final massacre. I didn't know that going in, or I wouldn't have WENT. Ditto, CUJO. Lewis Teague was an underrated director who was finally getting his just due, so I decided to plunk down... I read CUJO long before I saw the movie. I'd also read OLD YELLER when I was a kid. On top of all that, one of my worst and most painful childhood memories involved a puppy I'd raised that my drunken father had gassed. So I went into CUJO fully expecting the worst. And then came the end. I'm not saying that the end cheats (though it does), but this IS a fright film, after all- a horror movie. Horrible things happen to people- even kids- in horror movies.

I'm not sure this was included in the novel, as I've never read any of King's books, but you know if a movie works or doesn't, if inspired by a book or not. The set up has this free fun loving St Bernard, Cujo, chasing a rabbit. When Cujo sticks his face into a rabbit hole, a bat bites it, slowly transforming him into a rabid killer of the highest nature, something he normally isn't, where I as one, felt so sorry for the crazed mutt. Trouble strikes a mother and child who visit the family of the mutt, who operate a auto garage from their house, as their car has seen better days. To their dismay they can't find anyone, (some good reasons for that) and their car breaks down in the worst place, you guessed it. From here, it's a masterful showing and suspense and terror, where the film doesn't go straight for the gulliver. We've seen earlier what this rabid beast is capable of, so we know what can happen if Cujo gets his fangs into helpless mother and child. The situation becomes a sweating game of survival, a sit out as you will, of terror between dog and Mother and son (horror icon Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro) where the suspense factor really delivers. What's great here, is the reality of choices the duo make, where we'd pretty much do the same if in that same terrifying situation, where the suspense really works rewardingly for it. A lot of this part of the film, takes place in the car, and works beautifully, accompanied by great camera-work, which provides a real claustrophobic atmosphere, especially where the little boy, is losing consciousness, which became a real worrying part of the film. Also, what I liked about Cujo was the interesting background of characters, Daniel Hugh Kelly, a cereal advertiser and his cheating wife Wallace. One of the better constructed horror films, and horrors film itself. Watch if you dare.

Donna Trenton is cheating on her husband with a jealous boyfriend, her son Tad is constantly having nightmares about some invisible creature in his closet and her husband Vic has just lost the big Sharp Cereals account because a bad batch of cereal was sold it it made kids puke up red dye (which looked like blood to their parents).

She gets out of the car and Cujo, now coated in blood and yellow pus, comes at her and Tad. Since the car won't start, the mother and son are stuck there in the heat with no food or water in the rural area until somebody finds them or Cujo dies.Cujo wasn't bad, not at all, as far as acting, soundtrack and makeup go. The problem was the section between the part where Cujo is bitten by the bat and the part where Donna's car breaks down, it's very boring and not much fun to sit through. Also the Tad kid is rather annoying, he is pretty dorky and has the voice of a two-year-old girl.

Eventually a mother (Dee Wallace) and her young son (Danny Pintauro) crosses paths with the monster and soon they're trapped in their car unable to go anywhere. CUJO isn't a complete success but there are enough effective moments to make it worth sitting through. I'm not familiar with the Stephen King story so I can't comment on how close this movie follows it but I think there are a few problems here. One problem is that we're given a pretty worthless subplot involving the wife having an affair on her husband (Christopher Stone). I'm not sure if this played a bigger part in the book but here it just basically adds minutes to the running time and in the end it really adds up to nothing. Another problem I have with the film is that it's not nearly as intense as it should have been. In order for a film like this to succeed I think it needs to keep the viewer in constant terror as soon as everything starts to happen. That doesn't happen here, although there is one attack sequence inside the car that is quite chilling. Finally, the biggest problem with the picture is that it's simply way too predictable. With that said, Dee Wallace is extremely good in her role as the mother who is forced to fight this creature to try and save her son. Pintauro is also very good in his role as the child and it's fun seeing Stone, although his role isn't that well written. As I said, there's one attack scene inside the car that is quite thrilling but the rest of them are only mildly entertaining. The final showdown does manage to be quite exciting, although by this point you're ready for anyone to win just as long as the movie comes to an end.

It's not his fault, but it was some horrific acting by the (usually) lovable St. Bernard breed. The acting in the film was superb and perfect for the insanity caused by being trapped by an insane dog. I stopped myself from seeing this for years because&#x85;it's a dog film, about dog things and other possible non-interesting things. The relationship between mother and son especially was something that I never knew about, though, and it made the film a little more worth seeing than just a film about a crazy canine. And it's got the boy from Who's the Boss! What's not to love! I felt the marriage story was thrown in just to heighten the emotions of the story, but I don't know how badly it needed to be here. Just look at movies like Kill Bill where the female lead can hold her own while caring for her young. The music was pretty generic, symphonic filler, to me.If anything, I felt the story should've been more interesting and possibly tied in a relationship to the dog in some way. The disjointed fear of monsters is fine, but the translation from the book version to the film version screwed up the tie with this fear and actuality for the boy. I think the book version would have made this fear more weighted.It was a fine movie, but I wouldn't put it up there with movies I should own. It still feels like a creature-feature but without the backstory to make any sense of connection to this random dog. Watch it once and decide for yourself.

There are scenes where the dogs face is shown, bloody and oozing, where you feel bad for it mostly because of the innocence which still remained in the eyes at times. And then in other scenes the switch is flipped and the dog is scary as hell. Truly, kudos to the evil saint bernard.

Cujo's rabid interpretation could have been handled better and some of the acting could have been less clich√©d, which makes it a disappointment. Such films as Christine and The Shining have portrayed action, direction and particularly acting superbly when compared to Cujo, and comparing these films side by side makes King's rabid movie even more inferior. It's not a disaster and not even awful, it's just ok and disappointing, especially how, with better cinematography (yes, it's 1983 but still, look at Evil Dead and Christine) and acting and dialogue hand-in hand, could have been another classic.

It's a respectful - if not completely faithful - version of the story that captures a lot of its visceral power.It actually takes its time to get started (unlike a lot of modern movies where the aim is clearly to have things happen as fast as possible) and gives us all too human and thus easily relatable characters to follow before and during their horrible ordeal in a Maine dooryard.Dee Wallace is wonderful in this as Donna Trenton, a young mother who's had vague unpleasant thoughts about growing old and bored as a homemaker in the small Maine town of Castle Rock. She has an affair (with her real-life husband Christopher Stone playing the lover) that she comes to regret, while her husband Vic's (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) business is threatened by a health scare involving one of the products that it's advertised. Eventually Donna and little son Tad (Danny Pintauro) find themselves stranded by a malfunctioning car on the property of local mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter). And there Cujo strikes. Cujo was a good hearted St. Bernard dog who contracted rabies after being bitten on the nose by a rabid bat, and now the dog is a killer. With nowhere to go, Donna has a hard time making it through the subsequent siege by the dog.Once Cujo kicks into gear, it's a hell of a film, with plenty of nerve jangling thrills and intense action scenes. The animal action (supervised by Karl Lewis Miller) is first rate and the several St. Bernards playing the part of Cujo are all impressive. The cinematography (by Jan de Bont) and camera-work are exemplary; note the handling of an early scene in Tad's bedroom and a later one inside the car. The makeup is very well done also. You really feel the heat and discomfort experienced by Donna and Tad, and feel like you're trapped inside that car with them.In addition to Wallaces' award-caliber performance, the rest of the cast is excellent right down the line. Young Pintauro proves to be a very good screamer.Cujo is one of those movies that definitely takes you on a ride, complete with many hills and valleys along the way.

Director Lewis Teague, working from a tight script by Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier, gradually builds the steadily mounting tension to a nerve-wracking fever pitch, pulling out all the stops in the positively harrowing second half of the movie. Prolific composer Charles Bernstein's spooky, rattling, throbbing score further adds to the wrenching suspense. Jan de Bont's beautifully fluid and agile cinematography also does the trick. The terrific supporting cast qualifies as another major asset Daniel Hugh-Kelly as Donna's decent, well-meaning, but ineffectual husband Vic, Christopher Stone as Donna's macho lover Steve Kemp, Ed Lauter as scruffy, abusive mechanic Joe Camber, Kaiulani Lee as Joe's timid wife Charity, and Mills Watson as Joe's slobby friend Gary. Special kudos are in order for Wallace's extraordinary tour-de-force performance in the demanding lead; she's essentially the glue that holds this picture together. Pintauro likewise impresses with his remarkably mature acting; he thankfully avoids the usual cute kid actor mannerisms. But what makes this film so strong and frightening is the overall plausibility Teague brings to the story; everything that happens in the narrative seems like stuff that could actually occur in real life. A total gut-ripper. "},{"Title":"Fairly violent.

There's a deep emotional sub-plot between the family and Cujo. He wasn't bad since the beginning so when he gets rabid and starts killing everyone on his way, is when the real drama begins as he takes vengenace on some unlikeable people.Dee Wallace delivers a fine convincing performance. Danny Pintauro steals the show with a strange performance in my opinion. For some reason, this boy seems to always be sad or depressed.The effects are good but kind of naive. So if you want to watch a decent movie about a killer dog well this is the best of it's kind.But beware, if you are looking for a serious Horror movie, avoid Cujo because it won't fulfill your expectations.

Some Stephen King films are much better than others. This is one of the very good ones. It centres on a marriage where perhaps out of boredom has ended up with the wife having an affair with the local craftsman. On finding this out the husband needs time to think and goes to an emergency advertising meeting for ten days which is out of town and tells his wife to take the car which needs repair to the local mechanic. Enter Cujo, a big soppy St Bernard who loves all people. Unfortunately he has been bitten by a rabid bat and as the film goes on he gradually starts killing people. The car breaks down when they get up there and they are marooned with a killer dog trying to eat them. A very good film with first class acting, the tension was built up beautifully. My only criticism was that in some shots when Cujo was attacking people it was wagging its tail which doggies only do when they are happy !!

A rabid dog killing people. The first half is a little slow, but it builds the main players up well. The second half plays out like Jaws on Land with the victims stranded in a broke down Ford instead of a boat. The acting is top notch. The boy playing Tad does some of the best child acting I've seen, I really felt bad for him. The dog attack scenes just look real. No CGI crap. The ways the attacks are edited just make them appear more violent and realistic. Cujo has aged well and doesn't feel dated. I'm pretty sure if this film was remade today the attack scenes wouldn't look any better or more realistic. I wouldn't classify this as a Horror film; it's more of a Suspense or Nature Gone Wild film. Cujo has no motives. He's just doing what rabid dogs do. He didn't have some bad childhood or lazy camp councilors to blame. This doesn't mean some scenes aren't scary. As Cujo slowly gets worse he becomes sensitive to certain sounds, this was somehow quite creepy to me. Toward the end the poor guy seems to be losing his mind. At one point the endless screaming of the mother and child make Cujo attempt suicide via a car door. Most of the folks who get killed in Cujo have it coming to them. This makes the dog some kind of Karma Soldier, taking out the white trash so-to-speak. I mostly just felt bad for the dog.

The books of his have an effect that can only be done through writing, and not by filming. That is the reason that his movies aren't as good as the books. The novel Cujo is one of the most gut wrenching and disturbing novels I've ever read. The movie isn't terrifying, but there is one exceptionally scary moment, and there is a lot of suspense.The story is realistic and is absent of any of the supernatural elements that you would expect in a King movie. The story is about a Saint Bernard who becomes Rabid in a rural Maine town. That is the basis of the story, but it also focuses on two families, one is from the rural town, and the others are from the city and were looking for a great life in the country side. Both of these families have marriage problems, and both of the husbands have job problems. A course of events takes place in the first 45 minutes that has nothing to do with horror, but more so about the characters and the slow progression of rabies that Cujo has. Eventually, a moment strikes and horror is what takes place throughout the last 45 minutes of the movie.(spoiler) The problem with this movie is that it ruins the book. The book has somewhat of a message that was told through a heart breaking ending that many couldn't stand, but the movie ruins the ending. Otherwise, it's a pretty decent horror movie, but it's nothing like The Shining.

The Birds is one. The first Night of the Living Dead is one. Even Texas Chainsaw Massacre effectively gets at a similar idea. What idea is that? The basic horror premise of outside, uncontrollable, unexplainable forces out to exact an uncertain vengeance on humanity. Granted, Cujo makes sense to us, but to the characters he's trapped in a car, he is a monster of immense power, an object of fear.That kind of deep analysis is most likely exactly what the filmmakers wanted us to make, after seeing the movie. But they've run into a few problems, immense problems, with the execution of the film. Not the least of which is the fact that Cujo is never really all that terrifying.The acting is standard Hollywood. Professional, if uninteresting. The cinematography, by Jan DeBont, is quite good. The script, though, carries the biggest flaws. The worst of them is the lack of anything interesting for the characters to do. For the first hour of the movie, we watch a typical family melodrama. The falling apart of a marriage, the daily struggle of making a living, and so on. This is intercut with footage of an increasingly messy Cujo, just to remind us that we're supposed to be watching a horror movie. And then the movie, for lack of a better term, takes off. It leaves the stories, the subplots, and the family issues behind (mostly), and lets the mother (Dee Wallace) and her son get trapped in their car by a now violently rabid Cujo. It's never explained why she's driving such a junky, broken down car, when her husband seems to be rather well paid. Then again, the entire second half of the movie is built on her car breaking down, so such plot conveniences are expected from this inept script. The scenes in the car are repetitive, dull, and not particularly frightening. Even as an asthmatic, I hardly felt a moment of sympathy for the suffocating son. The scenes at the end are obvious, heavy handed, and well filmed. The fact that they are well filmed leads a lot of people to dismiss the general stupidity of most of what ends up going on. It's slick horror, well made, and easily accessable. Stephen King is responsible for some great horror movies. The Shining, The Dead Zone, and Misery are just a few. This movie could have been in that category, because the idea is a good one. Like Jaws, it's simple, to the point, and in theory, terrifying. But this movie hasn't got the first idea how to scare us. And it muddies the point with so many things we don't care about, so many pointless, sidetracking, poorly conceived moments, that we forget what was supposed to be scary in the first place.

Problems with this film are numerous the action doesn't get started until 40 minutes in, and then quickly gets stuck in a single location; the direction is workmanlike and bland; the dog is never convincingly threatening, with lots of fast cuts and shaky camera-work to convey a lot of the attacks; characters often make stupid decisions so that the plot can put them and others in danger; almost all the characters are annoying and unlikeable, particularly the little boy; the sub plots of the affair and the ad campaign aren't all that interesting and take up far too much time. There are some good points, though Dee Wallace is good and convincingly portrays the exhaustion and terror of someone in her situation; she's also pretty good in the sub-plot of the affair, putting in a reserved but believable performance and helping to evince sympathy for her character; Jan de Bont photographs the film well; and there were two or three genuinely tense moments.

I noticed a reference to the change in the ending.The plot of the movie is as follows - a St. Bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree.The plot sounds quite worn now, having been done in various movies. However it might have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or perhaps King's novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie.Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. I found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the TV, come on, get started!. The events that I was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a TV movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a TV soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but it didn't get enough screen time in this section. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later.After the 40 minute mark point, something finally happened. The dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. It began attacking some people. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this overly long second half, the suspense would build up well before dying again. It was just a stop-go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion.Without giving the ending away, I can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a Stephen King story.The suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch. Some great camera angles add menace to the dog's vicious nature when he attacks people. This is particularly important because as others have mentioned a St. Bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as, say, a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen. The music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful. This may fit a TV movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer.This brings me on to a wider problem with this movie - the photography. The camera-work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap TV movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on Channel 5 here in the UK where I am writing this comment from.The top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie's dull segments. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given. I could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. I won't pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do.As someone who is a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, both movie adaptations of famous Stephen King novels, I had high expectations for this movie. But it turned out to be a massive disappointment.Overall, I do not recommend fans of Stephen King or horror movies in general to watch CUJO. This is one of those moments where I have to recommend the book rather than the movie. Hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do.

Then Wallace and the kid are trapped in a broken down car with a rabid dog (Cujo) outside trying to get in. No one knows where they are.**SPOILERS** Strange film. The first 50 minutes or so are mostly about the family and their marital problems. There's nothing wrong with that but Wallace (who can be good) gives a horrible performance and Hugh-Kelly tries but he seems to be confused on how to play the role. The kid is OK but you're basically stuck with characters you really could care less about. However 50 minutes in they get stuck in the car with the dog outside--THAT'S when the movies works. It's very uncomfortable to watch though--the poor dog himself is suffering (although no dog was harmed making this) and seeing a kid slowly dying is unbearable. The scene where he gets in the car and attacks Wallace while the kid screams in the back is almost impossible to watch. It has a good music score and is well-directed by Lewis Teague.

The film is mostly about a rabid St. Bernard who traps a woman and her young son in a disabled Ford Pinto. They have taken the auto to a farmhouse for service, but the family members have either gone away on a trip or become dog treats. Nobody is there to help them, and since cell phones were not yet available for widespread public use, the two find themselves in one heck of a predicament. Mail has even been suspended to the farm, so not even the mail man will be able to save them! Not that he'd have been much trouble for the dog, anyway! Also complicating things are repeated respiratory attacks (asthma?) that the boy keeps having. You get the sense that he won't last long in that car.The film uses two big subplots to set everything up. One deals with the woman's husband away on a business trip, while the other deals with an affair she's having. Neither of these subplots really lead anywhere, they merely complicate the situation and fill out the screen time. The film really only hits its stride when the dog is bearing down on the helpless victims.A lot of the credit for creating such a scary situation of course has to go to Mr. King. Usually I'm not a fan of his, though many other people in this world think he's a god. My biggest problem with his writing is the fact that he often cheats. By cheating I mean he uses supernatural elements to power his stories and put his characters in peril. His best work is when real people are put in situations that could actually happen. Cujo and Misery are examples of two stories that could really happen. This is the main reason why they work better than Pet Semetary or Night Shift or some of the other stinkers his books have produced.The direction is very good. I looked pretty hard for a reflection of the camera in one of the many shots of car windows. I found none. The film is very suspenseful when it needs to be. Not only are the dog attacks brutal, but simply showing the dog looking in at them is pretty creepy. We see numerous POV shots from the dog, as we wonder what will set him off next. The ringing of a phone from inside the house seems to really make him angry. After a while, the child's health problems become too dire for them to wait in the car any longer. The mother is forced to square off with this big, slimy, and angry dog. That part will have you on the edge of your seat.The film did okay at the box office. It's always a difficult shoot when so much revolves around an animal. Apparently they used several dogs to play Cujo. Most of them kept licking off the syrup they used for blood and the slime associated with rabies. Loved the part by Ed Lauter, too! That guy rules.The verdict 6 of 10 stars.

It however lasts too long (half the film!) - the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway, and it just about creates zero suspense. The easiest film (according to plot and time) to compare this to it the classic Jaws. Everything that Jaws does right, Cujo does wrong. Jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread. Cujo does neither. Jaws effectively creates a scary, creepy villain in its shark. Cujo has a dirty St Bernard running about growling and jumping, and not a lot else. Jaws is exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless bore that remains predictable right to the end.Also confusing is the plethora of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot.If this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good.

Basically, the dynamics of the story are all wrong as King analyses the idea of the family pet going mad from the perspective of another family! Because the dog belongs to someone else, and the people under threat from it haven't spent any time with it prior to it trying to kill them ensures that a good idea isn't taken advantage of, which is rather shocking considering King's obvious talent for horror. The first scene of the film sees a St. Bernard chasing a rabbit. He ends up chasing it into a cave, where the dog is bitten by a rabid bat. Meanwhile, Vic Trenton has learned that his wife is having an affair and while he's away on business, she takes their son to the garage to get the car fixed...where they bump into the rabid St. Bernard.Most of King's stories take in supernatural elements, so the fact that this one doesn't ensures that it has grounding in reality, which makes the whole thing scarier. The central set-piece, which sees a mother and child trapped in a car while man's best friend prowls around outside is very well done and director Lewis Teague (who also directed the slightly better Cat's Eye) creates a good sense of attrition between the two parties. The St. Bernard itself makes for a good lead villain, as the dog has an imposing presence and is utilised well. Interestingly, it also manages to straddle the line between pathos and viciousness. In fact, the dog is by far the best performer in the movie. Dee Wallace-Stone (from 'The Hills Have Eyes') gets dirty and desperate in the lead role, and is flanked by an annoying performance from child actor Danny Pintauro. Rounding off the cast, Daniel Hugh Kelly is given little to do in his role as the third wheel to the central threesome. All in all, Cujo actually isn't a bad movie. It certainly could have been a lot better, but it's fairly original and the dog makes for an interesting lead.

Lucky for me, I had subscribed to a Stephen King movie offer a few years ago, and had Cujo (among other worthless movies) lying around. I had never watched it, and put it in the VCR the second I finished the book.So what did the filmmakers do with the story?The only thing they got right -- which was done very well -- was the dog. Okay, I was freaked out, surprised, I even squirmed a few times -- and this was with the surprises of the novel fresh in my head. But a few good thrills does not a good movie make.The subplot with Charity Camber, a powerful tug-of-war with Joe over the direction their son, Brett, is going to take, isn't even alluded to. How Joe, father and husband, can die while seemingly not effecting anyone else is beyond me. He has a kid and a wife! Isn't that important to the story? It was in the book!Also, the subplot with Donna cheating on Vic was toned down to the point of being inconsequential. Where was the tension? In the book, I would argue that that *was* the plot, with Cujo trapping Donna and Tad in the car coming in a distant second. I was pulling for these people in the book. I was wanting it to work out. I wanted to see the note, and the sexual undertones. But, well, can't fit them into a 95 minutes movie I guess.And don't get me started on the ending. Talk about a wimp out.Overall, if you watch a cheap, obviously dated, thrill, this isn't the worst you're going to find.

Cujo is the name of a big and friendly St. Bernard that becomes deadly and aggressive after being bitten by a rabid bat. Lassie from hell first kills his owner and than takes hostage of a mother and her son in a broken-down car. I haven't read the novel but the person I've watched this movie with did and she claims it's a very faithful adaptation of King's writing and one of the most successful ones, too! Stephen King has the talent to uphold the tense image of two people trapped in a car for two-thirds of a book but it's not matter of course to translate this to a screen without losing its impact. Director Lewis Teague succeeded in making the most out of the scary struggles between dog and car. Cujo starts rather slow and throughout the entire first 45 min. you feel like you're being stuffed with information that isn't essential to the plot. The heart-breaking story of a seemly happy family falling apart due to adultery isn't top priority if you're watching a horror movie, right? If you manage to overlook the fake sentiment and family drama, you'll be rewarded with an action-filled climax and some delightfully gruesome make-up effects. The crew did their best to make the St. Bernard look threatening with filthy mud on his fur, blood-soaked teeth and merciless eyes. Yet, you can't help facing that the dog evokes feelings of pity instead of terror. That's probably another reason why it's easier to be compelled by a book.

The result is a fairly competent Stephen King adaptation of a big, friendly pooch that is somewhat innocently turned into a bloodthirsty devil dog.One frolicky afternoon in the sunshine, the title farm dog is pursuing a scampering bunny rabbit through the countryside. Mistakenly popping his head into what he thinks is Thumper's underground domicile, is instead infested with bats. One pierces poor Cujo's schnozz and days later, the chaos begins.On the other side of town, more mundane things are being played out. Your average three-person family --- complete with a kid who fears his closet at bedtime --- are going through the motions. Sure, we wouldn't mind a little character development and subtext for what's to come, but it's this part of the screenplay that nearly kills the film. Completely needless subplots populate this thing like no tomorrow, involving extra-marital activities, the most average town stud of the 80s, and an asinine attempt at damage control for --- you ready? --- a cereal campaign that's made America physically ill. What any of this crap is doing in a horror film is beyond me.But once you've slogged through that superfluous nonsense, you're permitted a decent little thriller. We observe a mother and her young son damned by a 70s eyesore Pinto which malfunctions at exactly the wrong time. What neighborhood farm does is crap out at? You guessed it. The residence of the now bloodsoaked, dirtied Cujo.Director Teague ought to be commended for keeping the action so tense in what ends up being (basically) a one location film. A supremely trained movie dog (or possibly *dogs*) evoke genuine fear and panic for the audience. And Teague as well creates a perfect sense of isolation for the desolate setting, which in many King novels, is a character in itself. Jan de Bont's cinematography is superbly skilled as well, most impressively involving a steadicam shot approaching the open door of the Pinto. And an excellent one rotating around Cujo as he sits on the porch of the house, the car in his sights.Wallace and Pintauro carry the film quite well, though Pintauro's screechy whining can be a bit much at times. But that's what it makes it so convincing! You feel a legitimate observation is going of how these two people would cope with being held hostage by a serial mutt. Other characters seem to occupy the screen for the sole purpose of distancing themselves from the audience, so when they're attacked, we feel better about it. And the bearded lathario who allegedly has several mistresses at his disposal, still sees it necessary to take a knife to one of his conquests homes out of her rejection of him. Please.The close of the film leaves an important visual off-screen (lemme just say gunshot!), and the final frame (especially the music) is right out of a soap opera. And I'm sorry, but as a dog lover, there were just times that I actually had sympathy for Cujo. He's not inherently evil to begin with, and most notably in the beginning, is viewed as a fluffy, friendly canine. So to see him descend into a killing machine was almost a bit depressing at times.But if you can power through a fodder-laden start (or even utilize the fast forward button), Cujo is a passable scare-fest for a Friday night with friends.

They're loyal. They're loving. They're playful. They have an infectious enthusiasm. And they possess an uncanny ability to motivate us out of a state of bored complacency simply with a nasal nudge to the knee and a look that says Hey! You! Hurry up and throw me a damn stick, ya lazy bastard! But there's a darker side to our furry friends. There always just enough news reports about toddlers mauled by pitbulls to remind us that some breeds of dog were bred for centuries purely to kill. When a strange dog runs up to me, tongue lolling and eyes hopeful, there's a small part of my brain that always expects it to sink its teeth into my nutsack, tear off my testicles and call over all its doggie mates to run a rape train on my mouth while I lay bleeding and helpless. The mere offering of a pat could lead to my destruction by these sweet beasts, clutching my shredded groin and coughing up dog semen; brought low by a species that truly understands that savagery equals power. I'm guessing that everybody has thought that at some point, right? So it makes perfect sense that a dog can make for a perfect horror villain.Enter Cujo. Probably the most famous flick in the rather lacklustre killer dog sub-subgenre. But sadly, in no way is it a standout of its type. It takes a very mainstream approach so, while it succeeds as a drama, it fails as a horror. It takes the time to establish its characters, but for me that's just 40 minutes of wasted screen time, especially when the emotional elements feel devoid of any real emotion. Oh noes, she cheated on her husband and feels bad about it? Couldn't care less, just get to the canine carnage. Likewise the cinematography is quite classy and ticks all the boxes for a good drama, but it criminally fails to capitalise on the great claustrophobic environment presented.Admittedly, the sight of a 200 lb St. Bernard covered in blood and mucus makes for quite a fearsome figure. But it's handled so tamely that my deep-seated fears of genital mutilation and face rape remained dormant.Basically, this puppy has been neutered. It's horror that plays everything safe. Ugh.

Donna is going through a rough time with Vic, since she is just ending an affair with another man. Meanwhile, the Trentons meet the Cambers, a very dysfunctional family with a beautiful Saint Bernard named Cujo. What the Trentons and the Cambers don't know is that Cujo is very sick. He has been bitten by a rabid bat, and has become a violent killing machine. So, when Donna and Tad take their 1958 Pinto to the Camber house to get it fixed, signs of leaving are minimal, since Cujo is extremely angry and has them trapped in the car, fighting for their lives.Stephen King movies are either a hit or miss. But, despite Misery, the earliest King films are the best ones. Carrie, The Shining, Christine... those movies were genuine and really scared you. Cujo is another hit in the King album. This could have been another killer animal movie, just the same as Christine could have been another killer car flick. But there are a lot of things going for Cujo that make it classic King.Cujo is not a movie that has tons of BOO! scares. It is a film that unfolds with a slowly building tension, leaving the viewer completely on edge. While people think the scariest part of the film is seeing Cujo deteriorate, for me, the scariest part of the film is watching Donna and Tad try to escape this dog. It becomes a very emotional movie, and the characters gain your complete sympathy. I cared abut Donna and Tad, and I wanted to see them get out alive.This film has a tremendous sense of claustrophobia. Just the idea of being in a small space while being attacked by an evil being just sends chills up the spine. I felt like Cujo was getting into the car and clawing at me. It felt that real.The acting is magnificent. The performances of the cast come off as very believable, especially Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro as Donna and Tad. I was very frightened when Pintauro's character started to get sick, and I was hoping to God that Dee Wallace would be able to help him.Cujo is a very well-made film. It has tons of great shots, thanks to director Lewis Teague, and what great cinematography by Jan De Bont. Another intelligent aspect of the movie was me questioning whether the dog was real or not. According to Danny Pintauro, there were many different versions of the dog, including a real Saint Bernard and a man in a dog suit. And the only way to get the dog to attack the car would be to throw a plastic mouse in that had some sort of a scent.Stephen King should be proud of the way his material was handled on film. King movies are meant for one thing only to scare the crap out of you. And Cujo does that. It is a violent film, but it is also very suspenseful and smart. You'll think twice before you buy a Saint Bernard after watching this movie. In the entire collection of Stephen King hits, Cujo is another one for the books. Highly recommended.

In the film version, Cujo, a frolicsome St. Bernard to begin with, is bitten on the nose by a rabid bat, and by the time cheating housewife Donna Trenton and young son Tad (played to perfection by Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro) come to his owner's house for some car repairs, the overgrown pooch is a frothing mess and has already offed two people. What follows is a remarkably suspenseful siege, with mother and son trapped in their dilapidated Pinto while the monstrous, four-legged killer alertly skulks outside. If only Donna had on her the now-ubiquitous cell phone, most modern-day viewers will think, and today such a siege dilemma truly might not have to happen. But nevertheless, what an amazing wringer this picture puts us through! The film features inventive photographic touches by Jan de Bont (howzabout that 360-degree swivel shot inside the beleaguered car?!?) and imaginative direction by Lewis Teague that manages to squeeze every drop of possible tension out of the predicament. Kudos also to handsome Daniel Hugh-Kelly, who gives a nicely warm and sympathetic performance as Tad's father.

First of all, it had wonderful suspense and build-up. There was a clean, very well handled scare factor, and since they took so much time building up the last minutes of the film, they give you enough time to learn about the characters, to where you actually care for them, or care to have Cujo rip them to shreds, whatever kind of person you are and how you perceive the characters. There was a nice use of blood and gore that might disappoint gore hounds, but ultimately satisfy true horror fans, and the plot was very fun with no flaws.Also, since something like this could actually happen, it made the movie way more interesting and fierce than it already was; movies that are realistic or could ever happen, through a person's perspective, always seem to be more heart-racing, and I personally think animal attack films are the creepiest horror films out there. Why I do not love this movie more than I do is that the movie itself does get very boring and irritating at some points to the point where you are itching for something, anything to happen, and I could not help but get a little mad when they went with one of the most annoying horror clich√©s.The representation that people are going with of how the movie is meant to show the main character as a sinner and Cujo as her redemption is a little nauseating as well, whether it is true or not. Nonetheless, Cujo is a really fun movie, and I enjoyed it all the same. People criticize a lot about it, and even though there is a lot that one may find wrong with it, that is the case with every movie and every movie's main purpose is to entertain, which Cujo definitely does that.

Wallace-Stone plays an original desperate housewife, Donna Trenton, who, somewhat neglected by her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) has an affair with family friend Steve Kemp (played by Christopher Stone - the Stone in Wallace-Stone, who sadly died some time ago).Wallace-Stone once again plays a loving mother, though this time, thanks to her affair, is somewhat distant from her son Tad (child actor Danny Pintauro), but later in the film, their relationship is defined well when they both go through a harrowing performance with the infamous Cujo.Strangely for a horror movie (but not unwelcome), and certainly not untypical of a Stephen King adaption, most of what goes on during the film is rather mundane, just the day-to-day life of the Trentons, which makes for interesting drama in itself. It's not until Donna and Tad become trapped in a car (for reasons that I won't go into), things really start to heat up, as the dog Cujo, riddled with rabies, tries many attempts to get into the car and attack the mother and son.The time where the Trenton's are trapped in the car is done very well, and they seem to go through everything one would expect from someone in their situation. Both Wallace-Stone and a young Pintauro do remarkably well in these scenes.Cujo does fit into the horror genre as the rabid-dog concept seems to fit there well, however the film evoked terror more than horror, as the performances were so real, and the situation, while unlikely, is not highly improbable. So don't watch this expecting a crazed dog savaging anyone and everyone throughout the whole film, watch it and enjoy the great acting from Wallace-Stone, the tense drama and frightening scenes.

The book was incredibly scary and had a typical Stephen King ending. In other words, a happy ending for one character, and a fatal ending for another. It's like Stephen always gives you something to drink against your thirst, but it's got an unpleasant taste.  This movie being a Hollywood production, you can forget that it ends unhappily.  What makes this movie so scary is that it places average people in a realistic situation. After all, there have been plenty of people bitten by rabid dogs. It's got the usual cliche's, yes. But it deals with them in advance. For example, when terrorized by the dog, the car won't start. This is a typical cliche, but you knew in advance that the car had engine problems to begin with. The failing engine was not an out of the blue coincidence. The movie tries to set up some of the characters, as it should, because it's a movie about people, not cartoon characters. The problem is that in the book these people were at least somewhat likeable, where as here they are totally unsympathetic or just plain uninteresting. The woman played by Dee Wallace sleeps around on her husband, and you almost agree, seeing that her husband is a total grump, unlikable and emotionally incompetent fool. But sleep around on him with a guy like the one played by Christopher Stone (Dee Wallace's real life husband) is putting salt on a badly hurting wound. If you manage to ignore this wasted opportunity to set up interesting and sympathetic people you'll be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie, as it's nothing but a big nasty killer machine on four legs not letting up until all living things in it's neighborhood are dead.

It's a harrowing tour- de-force. If you really haven't seen it, thinking it would just be boring, watch it the first time on a home theater with all of your lights out. It's a mesmerizing ride. Very scary.Cujo is one of the most brilliant horror films ever crafted. "}{"Title":"Professional adaptation of less than stellar novel","Date":"6 June 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Stephen King is a veritable assembly line of bestsellers, but Cujo comes in the days when he was still producing something relatively original rather than ripping himself off. Even with that it was one of his lesser efforts. A 400+ page story of a mother and son trapped in their stalled automobile during a sultry summer week by a rabid St. Bernard, Cujo the novel is filled with superfluous characters and padding topped off with an especially downer climax.The film, capably directed by Lewis Teague, pares down some of the novel's stuffing, but still not enough. Cujo is a kindly St. Bernard who in the opening moments of the film is bitten by a rabies-carrying bat. Given that his owners are the rural definition of clueless white trash, they have apparently never heard of getting their pets vaccinated, which results in Cujo's progressively painful descent into madness and death. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro are the mother and child, Donna and Tad Trenton, who circumstances strand at Ed Lauter's makeshift repair shop/home where Cujo is in the throes of rabies.The heart of the film and its most tense passages are obviously the ordeal experienced by the mother and son. Unfortunately, like King's long-winded novel, the film takes forever and a day to maneuver its characters into position. We must endure subplots involving Wallace's tryst with local handyman Chris Stone, which results in the estrangement with husband/father Daniel Hugh Kelly. Another subplot revolves around a lawsuit at Kelly's advertising firm, which takes him out of the picture at an inopportune moment. Young Pintauro's rather protracted fears of imaginary monsters gets further screen time and then there are the moments dedicated to the Cujo's loutish owner Lauter, his drinking buddy Mills Watson, his mousy selfish wife Kaiulani Lee and their son, Billy Jacoby, who seems entirely too well spoken and well adjusted to have sprung from the diseased loins of these borderline hillbillies. Purportedly King wrote the novel while in the throes of alcoholism and it shows as plot threads are scattered all over the place.Once the film heads into its final third and is focused on its main plot, it has a number of tense moments to make viewing worthwhile at least once. Director Teague ably amps the tension and captures the grim despair of the trapped duo. Oddly, despite some earlier moments detailing Cujo's agony, the latter third of the film seems to forget all about the animal's suffering in favor of turning into the proverbial monster. Teague also gets first-rate performances from Wallace and Pintauro. Wallace was a popular fixture in early 1980s films and it is often forgotten what a solid and sympathetic actress she could be as demonstrated here. I have heard people mention that Pintauro's increasing hysterics get on their nerves, but I think his performance is fairly strong and convincing. I feel he manages to convey the terror and confusion of the young boy while maintaining a degree of believability and sympathy. I certainly find him less aggravating than Dakota Fanning's shrieky child in War of the Worlds. Kudos must also be given to the dogs playing Cujo.Any flaws in the film ironically stem from its source and are mirrored in the novel, while the biggest successes come from the direction and performances. On a side note and something I want to address A number of King purists were aghast at the film's somewhat more upbeat ending regarding Tad's fate, but I think it plays better in the film. While I am not against a child dying in fiction for some great dramatic impact, Cujo is far too flimsy a novel for that kind of drama. Further, King's novel left a sour tase with its arrogant, high-handed insinuation that the attack and Tad's subsequent death were somehow Donna's fault for being a cheating wife, and the death of the innocent Tad was some kind of penance that needed to be paid. This trope of the innocent children paying for the sins of the parent got overworked and tiresome a long time ago and ends up adding nothing to this particular story, so changing it only manages to improve already flawed material.

Tired the next morning, they drive off to mechanic Joe Camber, (Ed Lauter) auto repair shop and meet his dog, Cujo. While Vic concerns himself with work, Donna and Tad take their run-down car back to his repair shop after being impressed with his work before and notice that Cujo has changed. Realizing he's been bitten by a rabid bat and turned into a hulking monstrosity, they become trapped inside as the vicious dog guards the car day and night, preventing every escape opportunity. When Vic discovers her missing, he races to help her against the dog.The Good News There wasn't a whole lot to like about this one, and the few good parts are all at the end of the film. They are the few individual attack scenes on the car, which are simply unsettling and quite suspenseful. To see a dog try that intently to get inside a car to get at the hapless, screaming characters trapped in it is utterly terrifying, and is rightly milked for all it's worth. From the jump tactics where it appears out of nowhere barking against the glass window or seeing it emerge from it's hiding spot, race over to the car and bark and claw to get inside, the scenes strike the right touch and are quite unsettling. The final showdown, with the savagely bitten and emotional battered character strikes back is a really tense scene, with the right amount of action and suspense put into it to make it satisfying. The dog does look pretty creepy, being distorted enough to recognize it was once a dog while also retaining a fearsome image. The addition of all the other items to it gives it a nice and threatening appearance, and it helps add to the film. However, these were the film's best qualities.The Bad News This was a huge disappointment. One of the things it gets wrong is that the opening half is incredibly boring and very slow paced. The infidelity, the focus on the business, the crumbling marriage, all of it could've been shortened or chopped out and not left one dent in what the film was about. It's supposed to be about a killer dog attacking victims trapped inside their car, and to give the audience scenes that distract from that are only going to induce boredom and contempt. The other really fatal mistake is to make the attack scenes so far apart from each other. The last half hour of the film is the reason for the whole appeal of the film, which are relegated to just a few minute-long scenes or so and then spend the majority of the time on the characters inside muttering contempt for the dog or looking at it watching them. It is simply boring and would've been better had the attacks been nonstop and watched them struggle in vain efforts to escape the dog. To spend most of it watching the dog lie out in the sun watching the characters doesn't inspire much fear. It really could've capitalized on it's great premise, but falls short due to a supreme lack of interesting action going on and boredom from the grand finale.The Final Verdict While this did have a few good moments in it, the majority of the film is a slow, boring drama that really suffers from a lack of tension or action. Had it capitalized more on it's intriguing central premise, then it would've at least been decent, but this is really too slow to serve as anything other than a recommendation for hardcore King aficionados.Rated R Violence, Graphic Language and constant scenes of a child in danger "},{"Title":"Revenge of the 80's The works of Stephen King!","Date":"7 August 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" Cujo (1983) was the jump start of a cavalcade of Hollywood productions that were based upon the writings of Stephen King.

The eighties was a financial boon for Stephen King.

For those of you who don't know, Newfoundlands are large (average weight being 160 pounds), friendly dogs. I was worried by watching a horror movie about a rabid St. Bernard that I might become afraid of my friend's dog. I needn't have worried. Cujo is too boring and stupid to scare anyone.Cujo is a friendly St. Bernard who when chasing a rabbit, gets his head into something he shouldn't a cave filled with bats (are there bats that actually live in rabbit holes?). Anyway, poor Cujo gets bitten by a bat, and at first he seems to be the same normal, happy, lovable dog. But then he starts changing.The film is divided into two parts. The first is a trite and boring story about marital infidelity, and the second is a drawn out segment of a mom and her son being trapped in a broken down car with Cujo lurking outside.Neither one of these stories is even remotely entertaining. The first half of the movie is meant to introduce us to the characters, but it's so boring and stupid, and the characters never even achieve two-dimensionality. The second part of the story is the horror part of the movie, but it's not any better.First of all, the film has some very large credibility issues. I'm not a veterinarian, but I don't think a dog who has gone insane from rabies is capable of such devious plans as Cujo is. It becomes a war of attrition between Cujo, and Donna (Dee Wallace) and her son, Tad (Danny Pinero). If a dog has rabies, is he really going to be able to just sit and wait for his potential victims to get out of the car? I would be more willing to give a little leeway to the movie, but it's got an even bigger problem Cujo isn't particularly frightening. As messy and bloody as he looks, Cujo always has those sad puppy dog eyes that make you want to give him a hug (and a bath) rather than run away. How do you expect a film to scare someone when the the villain is a dog who looks at you like he's sorry for chewing your shoes? The attempts to make him menacing fail in the same way. When he attacks someone, he looks as if he's just happy to see them.The acting is flat, which only makes matters worse for this misbegotten project. Dee Wallace is not your average scream queen, despite her popularity in the genre. For one thing, she's not a big breasted teenage girl; she's a mom. This could have been an effective way to build suspense, but neither she nor her son are developed enough to really make it work. Daniel Hugh-Kelly looks more like Greg Brady than a horror movie character, and he acts like it. No one else is on screen long enough to make an impression (although the guy who plays the owner of the car repair shop looks the part).Don't be intrigued by the hype. It was said to have one of the scariest scenes in movie history (I would be interested to figure out which one it was), but the fact that the ranking was done by Bravo alone should tell you that that means zip.Cujo isn't scary, just stupid.

I think that Nature being Nature is often much scarier than anything the human mind can come up with (which is why the movie Outbreak did not need the Hollywood-esquire chase scenes later on -- the deadly virus was scary enough). Knowing that this movie had been made based on a story by legendary horror writer Stephen King about a rabid dog, I was intrigued. This dog wasn't possessed by evil or a mutant or of alien origin or anything like that. Just a friendly St. Bernard who got rabies and became a monster. How was King going to add his unique touch to this one? I was growing skeptical how compelling a villain could a rabid St. Bernard be and how scary a movie could they make about him?The answers are that Cujo is not a compelling villain and Cujo is not scary.Cujo is the most interesting character in the film, with the bunny he's chasing in the opening scene coming in second. (The kid was going to get an honorable mention, but I'll get to him in a minute.) The human characters are so artificial that the natural acting of the dog won my sympathy. I did not, however, ever feel scared of Cujo. I felt sorry for him. He's not mean-spirited or evil or anything like that; the poor dog has rabies and is only doing what he's doing because a bunch of tiny viruses are turning his brain into mush. He's a tragic villain, which horror villains can never be. Horror villains have to be menacing and EEEVIL or else we'll never fear them. Cujo won my heart though. Believe it or not, this movie actually made me like St. Bernards more. (Maybe I'll get one.) Now, about the characters and the story itself. First, this 95-minute film spends a solid 35 minutes setting up a bunch of stupid, clich√©d subplots that serve no purpose whatsoever except to kind-of-sort-of provide a reason for a woman and her young kid to drive to the spot where Cujo happens to be. Once they get there, we're treated to an hour in which we see the same old scares over and over again. (Like I said, if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the movie. There's only so many times that a dog head-butting a window can be scary, although it didn't scare me once.) I think the film was trying to go for the claustrophobic scare, where terror is generated from the thought that the woman and her kid can't leave the car for fear of Cujo. But, we never feel that terror, mainly because Cujo simply is not EEEEEVIL. Also, having the kid screaming his head off each time the dog shows up started to feel exploitative after a while. Horror movies usually have kids in traumatic situations, but if you're going to traumatize a kid for this long, the kid better either be possessed or he better have the shining. This movie could have worked with better direction and perhaps some innovative camera-work and editing, but it lacks all of that and so it doesn't work. Frankly, had the filmmakers cut out the first 35 minutes and trimmed the rest of the film down, they would have had a decent hour-long episode of The Twilight Zone. Cujo is a cool dog, but Cujo sucks.

The first half plods along, the second half builds up a head of steam but I still felt it was a little underwhelming and unexciting. The acting is fine by everyone involved, I've no complaints there. Technically the film is OK, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's generally well made.

Dragged into the marital heartache is young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic, and a pretty messed-up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics' yard for repairs, but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt. Things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter), isn't there (he has been savagely killed by his pet dog Cujo, a gigantic St. Bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) Soon, the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims. The weather is swelteringly hot; not a living soul knows they're there; the car won't start; and the dog seriously wants their blood......Cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller, but it never really clicks into gear. I've read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for King - so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little. On the printed page, King was at least able to generate a degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a St. Bernard simply isn't very scary. The visualness of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo IS a St. Bernard. In the book, it was possible to forget this. In the book, Cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster. Even with the relatively short running-time of an hour-and-a-half, Cujo becomes a tedious and patience-straining experience, occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be. They've even omitted the book's cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an all's well that ends well conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood!!! Chalk this one down as yet another inferior King adaptation.

And this is a pretty good movie over all.  The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful.  But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway?  No, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator.  She did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time!  I mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with.  But, forget the bat.  Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something?  I didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car.  Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?At the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by God she was still wearing high heels!  "},{"Title":"Boring","Date":"2 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":"  and totally non-scary film. The characters doesn't interest at all, and most of the time is spent in a car. The dog is at best ugly, never really scary. To interest, a more threatening menace would have been needed, at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you. And, not the least, something interesting must happen. Something unexpected. As it is, this film just drags on and on, in what seems like forever. Maybe a Saint Bernhard was not that smart to choose as the Terrible Threat to life and society?In most scary movies/thrillers/mystery, just whatever genre, there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens. Here you really don't care, you just wait for it all to stop, and wondering if it wouldn't be better to see something else. One of the weakest King adaptations. "}]
