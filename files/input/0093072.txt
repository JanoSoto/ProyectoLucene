And almost instantly we were perplexed. Absolutely flabbergasted by the fact that a movie studio would go ahead and produce this movie. It is by far one of the most poorly written movies I have ever seen. The bizarre plot never seems to come together and make sense. The gags run utterly flat and actually tend to leave you with a sick feeling in your stomach. Not to mention one of the poorest makeup jobs in film history. As for the acting, one word can describe it atrocious. The actors, with the exception only in some cases for Anthony Newley, seem to be doing nothing more than shouting their lines through the almost forced emotion, which comes over as horridly flat and unbelievable. If you're actually interested in this movie, I would go ahead and recommend it. A spectacle such as this film is something you rarely come upon.

It's a psychotic, surreal journey into the realm of the profoundly grotesque. The Garbage Pail Kids themselves are terrible in their deformity, with exaggerated facial features and apparent elephantitis of the cranium making them hurtful to witness. Poorly-done animatronics make them all appear as if their facial muscles have been injected with lidocaine. They have a collective IQ of approximately 58.It's not pleasant to watch. It's not funny, it's not kitschy, it's not camp. The dialogue is pat and smarmy, the characters stupid and forgettable, and the whole slimy mess reeks of greedy bastards trying to make a fistful of money on the flavor of the week. TGPKM is another example of how depressingly low the common denominator really is...and this was BEFORE the reality TV craze.It hurts.

Sometimes when I see bad movies, they are not so bad if mediocre,or movies that are so bad they're good, but there are other times when the movie that is supposed to be bad IS bad. This garbage belongs in the latter, it was so awful(in my opinion that is) that I didn't know whether to vomit or cry. I will give credit and say it is not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but that isn't saying much.Firstly, I do have to agree with other reviewers that this is one of the poorly written kids movies out there. I know this movie is supposed to be bad and mindless trash, but the dialogue alone makes it not only bad, it makes it garbage. The dialogue is mega lame and not quotable at all, and I didn't laugh once. The humour was also very grotesque, I know the cards are quite grotesque, and movies like Freddy Got Fingered had grotesque and very unsubtle humour, but The Garbage Pail Kids Movie takes the whole meaning of the word grotesque to a whole new level and in a bad way. Plus the pranks are very mean-spirited, as is the knockabout violence.Then there is the story. What was the story again? To me, it had those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer written over it, it is one of the most poorly constructed stories in a movie, with drawn out scenes, plodding pace you name it. Next, the production values, am I the only person who thought they were appalling? The sets were poor, the lighting was dim, the camera work was like direct to video quality, the special effects were laughable and the costumes were horrible. Don't get me wrong, I like 1980s fashion, it is funky and cool, but the costumes here made me want to gouge my eyes out.Even the soundtrack was awful. Generic, lifeless and uninspired, even worse than the music in Disaster Movie, which sounded like it had been made up on the spot at last minute. Not to mention it is the epitome of cheesiness. And the acting was atrocious. Anthony Newley was wasted as Captain Manzini, and MacKenzie Astin is a bland and inept child protagonist. Juice and Tangerine are underdeveloped and clich√©d, and Ali Gator, Greaser Greg and Nat Nerd are unlikeable and I think ugly characters with voices that have haunted me in my sleep since seeing the movie last night. And they wasted Jim Cummings completely here, the immortal voice actor who gave us Darkwing Duck, Dr RobotNik and Don Karnage has sounds utterly embarrassed here, it makes me want to cry.Overall, absolutely awful. When I finished watching it, yes I watched the whole thing, I was like what was that? 1/10(and that is being kind, I could tell even from the title it wasn't going to be good).

You won't trust me. It is too allurring to not watch it for yourself, but you'll regret it. Mackenzie Astin cries frequently, is a foot shorter than his love interest, wins over a girl named Tangerine by designing Michael Jackson jackets, and distracts a bully by twirling a basketball on his finger, which should all have me rolling on the floor laughing hysterically, but instead I just stare aghast at the TV wondering if it would be better if the whites of the Kids' eyes maybe be white instead of dingy yellow. The GPK are so awkward, innocent, and happy, as they sing songs about team work, that you feel guilty laughing at them. Isn't there supposed to be violence, and maybe lewdness beyond the average PG potty humor? The character Valerie Vomit doesn't even vomit until the very end of the movie, but Windy and Nat sure do fart and pee a lot. Anyone have any ideas about why they came from a garbage-pail-rocket in space, yet they now reside in a magician's antique shop? Me neither.

That's not an exaggeration, and it's not the only example of the flick's careless comedic redundancy. Combine that with an appalling song and dance number (seriously), a horribly out-of-place romantic subplot (starring a pre-pubescent boy and a girl well into her twenties, no less) and a gang of foils cut clumsily from recycled cardboard.

It wasn't necessarily a title that I was interested in, but due to its nostalgic value, I thought my wife would enjoy it.I do remember the Garbage Pail Kids pretty well, although they were a bit after my time. It's no secret that the Garbage Pail Kids were supposed to be a disgusting and weird parody of the ever-so-clean Cabbage Patch Kids. When I rented it, I thought maybe there'd be some kind of creative use of sick and twisted humor, since the trading cards always had such delightfully vile characters on them. Was I ever wrong&#133; First, let me start with the characters themselves. They looked exactly like they did on the trading cards, which was actually off putting in its own way. The costumes were very detailed, but the animatronics were horrible to say the least. It made me wonder if the people who designed them had been fired from Chuck E. Cheese's design studio.Next, we have the acting, but that's stretching it a bit; I've seen stronger scripts in 1970's porn. One commenter stated that It looked like they were just making it up as they went along, to which I second that, although none of the dialog was even that imaginative. I just loved how the so-called bully (Juice) would harass Dodger, portrayed so ineptly by Mackenzie Astin by calling him a creep and then throwing him down in the sewer, dumpster, etc. All the human roles were cookie-cutter stereotypes and had absolutely no depth or personality whatsoever. I realize that this movie was made for kids, but even in other kid-friendly movies I've been forced to watch, you generally have some feeling or care about what's going on, even if it's only surface feelings. Watching this movie was the equivalent of having you eyelids propped open with toothpicks and duct tape and having to sit through an ABC After School Special about teen mothers played frame-by-frame in slow-motion and starring Scott Baio.Two things I still can't get over were two locations used in the storyline TOUGHEST BAR IN THE WORLD and the STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY. I suppose the writers felt that their audiences were certified mentally challenged and that it's imperative that everything must be spelled out for them.Movies can be silly, satirical, humorous, weird and even stupid sometimes, but this movie lacks all but the last I one I mentioned on this list.

There's not anything redeeming about this movie, AT ALL. no good times, no heartfelt jokes, not even sappy awwww moments. Don't get me wrong, I collected the cards and stickers when I was little, so I knew what the Garbagepail kids were all about, the flat, 1 dimensional quality of the cards spoke better than this live action film did.I know people will say this movie is made to be enjoyed for kids, but if I had kids, I wouldn't let them near this piece of s**t. The entire movie is shot is such a dark tone, that half the time you're squinting to see ANYTHING. Freakish/mutant kids are hidden away in a garbage pail, there's a great lesson right there, hide away those who are different. Loser boy works in a magic shop for an old man (who by the way the old man is the only enjoyable character in this whole film!!) Anyhow, freak kids escape can, refuse to go back in, we're treated to 90 minutes of burping, farting, pants wetting, whining, toe biting, vomiting, pimple busting, snot, etc., need I go on about this? You get the point.Tangerine, the female in this film is a teenage fashion designer who uses the loser kid once she finds out the abilities of the sweat shop kids. Usually the predictable result of such films involve the snotty character realizing her own wrongs and trying to make them right, not here! There's also some silly side plots about the kids going to bars, getting in with the toughs, all of whom look like they just got done filming the Michael Jackson Bad video, the romantic interest between the loser and the stuck up fashion designer.

No redeeming factors whatsoever, horrible acting, an inconsistent plot, terrible effects, and costumes that make me want to hurl.The first problem like I said is the story. Now I am only 16, so I never collected the trading cards that the moving is based on, but even if I did, you don't have to tell me that making a movie based on a trading card series that has no story behind them has Disaster Movie written all over it. Like many movies based on TV shows or toys, they just made up a bull crap plot line that is incredibly hard to follow, not because its bad, but because most of those in the theater are probably throwing up or cringing.That being said the film is GROSS. Now I know the cards are gross, but the film apparently thought that no one else knew that so they constantly remind us that the garbage pail kids are INCREDIBLY gross by having them fart, eat toes, play with snot, pee on the ground, you name it. And apparently this film was SUPPOSED to be for kids, the film is PG, but there are so many things said and done in this film that you would question the rating, now I'm not sure if the PG-13 rating existed back then, but you get the idea.But the music can't be bad right? Wrong! the soundtrack is awful, the soundtrack actually got a few razzies back in the day, which is to say I'd be amazed if it didn't win every razzie known to man.The costumes are also horrendously bad.

There's some near-romantic sub-plot with a cute girl in that group (making it even more awkward), and the nonsensical introduction to these unexplained creatures who come from a garbage can. They have names according to their gross-out specialities, and their appearance is enough to cause even the strongest stomachs to return their breakfast.

A couple of my friends went along and I still remember the sold out crowd of pre-teens laughing and having a blast with the film.

It really shocked me to re-watch something I found entertaining as a kid and I know that saying that many kids never grow up but thankfully I did. Now I'm not going to sit here and put this film down for being disgusting, vile or featuring ugly jokes because nothing here offended me today. What I will put down is the entire screenplay, which really makes one scratch their head because the story is so bad that you can't help but wonder if any real attempt was made to come up with something good or if this was just thrown together to make some quick cash. The story pretty much as the Garbage Pail Kids coming to the aid of a weak boy (Mackenzie Astin) who might just be getting taken advantage of by a girl (Katie Barberi) he has a crush on. I think the biggest problem with the screenplay is that it tries to tell too much story in regards to the GPK and this wasn't needed. The cards told us all we needed to know so the film should have just stood back and delivered the goods that the cards did. Valorie Vomit, Ali Gator, Greaser Greg, Nat Nerd, Windy Winston, Messy Tessie and Foul Phil are the kids here and most of them never really get to dig into their tricks from the cards. Valorie Vomit, for one example, only does her thing once at the end of the movie. Now, a lot of parents back in the day would have said that's a good thing but every generation has its thing that parents object to and this was one from the 80s. The performances are all pretty brutal with Astin not delivering anything and Barbieri delivering a really, really bad performance. You do have the costumes by John Carl Buechler who previously did the film TROLL and would later do Friday THE 13TH PART VII. While watching this horrid movie I couldn't help but smile at thinking back at some of the cards and passing them around class in the school.

Let me explain why I say this 1) Our protagonists are creepy latex and foam masked Cabbage Patch Kids rejects who do all sorts of rude and unsocial acts upon random citizens. The term bad special effects does not even begin to cover the creepiness of the Garbage Pail kids themselves, with creepy corpse-like eyes and gaping mouths. Their ugly physical appearances are matched by their horrible inner appearances, spending the entire movie stealing, looting, vandalizing vehicles, beating up random people in a bar, puking on people, and other such rude acts that would land any other person in jail (and these are the heroes).2) This movie seriously piles on one unfunny potty-joke after another, making many people sick to their stomachs from all the gross-out humor. I'm sure some people might think it's *hilarious* to see random pedestrians being covered in projectile vomit or see the zit-covered nerdy Garbage Pail kid pee his pants for the twentieth time, but I personally find this humor WAY to nauseating for my tastes.3) The message of the movie is SERIOUSLY contradictory to what we our shown, with the message being to not judge others on their physical appearances and to instead look at what is inside each person. The problem with this syrupy message is that the Garbage Pail kids prove that they are just as hideous on the inside as they are on the outside. So since when is stealing vehicles and being total jerks to random people considered nice, or is it technically okay for them to act this way since they're a bunch of giant headed weirdos from a magic trash-can (seriously). It's so bad that they make the random bullies in the movie look like stereotypical cub-scouts who help elderly ladies cross the street.There are other flaws with this movie (such as the bullies and their strange motivations or the random weird musical number that will make your ears bleed) but all of these pale in comparison to the biggest flaws I listed above. Some people might actually like this film, but I personally suggest that you don't even give this painful movie a second glance before running for the hills.

I was obsessed with them, and I even got to see this movie when it was released. I didn't remember a thing about it, but I was aware that it now has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. And, boy howdy, does it deserve it! This thing is simply dreadful. It brings to life seven of the trading card characters in all their disgusting glory, making them impossibly hideous dwarfs with hydrocephalic domes. Ushering them into the world is Sean Astin's younger brother Mackenzie, who uses their skills at clothing design (?!) to impress an older girl (Katie Barberi, quite attractive). She uses his affection to pass the clothes off as her designs. The film's attempts at humor are predictably juvenile, but I doubt I found them even close to funny, even as an 8 year-old. The movie isn't boring, but it's mind-numbingly awful. A must-see for anyone who likes bad movies, though, be warned, this is far from being so bad it's good. It's so bad it's soul-crushing!

This statement is one I would not even throw onto such horrendous films like Jack and Jill or Jaws The Revenge. This horrendous flop and waste of time was written, directed, and produced by Rod Amateau and is classified as one of the worst films of all time. The film tells the story of Dodger, a boy who is bullied and eventually meets the Garbage Pail Kids when his boss, Captain Manzini, brings their trash pail spaceship into his shop for safekeeping.The Garbage Pail Kids are a group of seven disgusting, I guess they are aliens, who come to the planet and have to be hidden for fear from Manzini and Dodger that they will be put in the prison for the ugly. From this comes the ironic moral of the story. The moral of the story is hypocritical at best. The moral is that ugliness is not on the exterior of someone, but their interior. This is where the hypocritical moral starts as the Garbage Pail Kids are overall bad people that would be going to jail in the universe the film is set in whether they were ugly or not. They constantly steal, including a truck, nearly run someone over, harass people who have done nothing to them, and destroy property. If you want to tell people that ugliness is on the inside, that is a fine moral, but then the people this is supposed to be shown about should not be as ugly on the inside as they are on the outside.There is a subplot of Dodger who wants to get the attention of his lead bully's girlfriend, Tangerine. To do this, he appeals to her sense of fashion by getting the kids to make him a fashionable jacket. After learning the truth, Tangerine decides to exploit the kids for her own personal gain by having a fashion show and claiming the kid's clothing to be her own.This is where the moral of the story comes into play with the terrible ending where Manzini and Dodger rescue the kids from the prison for the ugly and go to the fashion show. There, the kids rip the clothes off the models and terrorize the event. Tangerine is shown to be the ugly one because she was using people for her own self-interest. However, the kids are more in the wrong than Tangerine is and while I do not want to route for Tangerine, having her deal with the kids makes you want to route for her. The movie also fails with a target audience. A film like Aliens is for older audience while something like The Lion King is made for people of all ages. I guess this is targeted at kids but I do not think it would appeal to kids in the slightest, nor anyone else. From this, there is no audience that would enjoy this.There is little enjoyment that you can have from this film as everything is being taken too seriously. A film like Batman and Robin is bad but you can at least laugh at the awful pun lines that Mr. Freeze spouts out from time to time. The acting is taken too seriously so you can not even enjoy it when the acting is bad. In fact, for a comedy film, nothing is funny. The funniest thing is a poorly made sign on a building that looks like it was made with poster board and a permanent marker.If I could, I would give this film a 0/10 on this website, but since I can't, I must bless this monstrosity with a 1/10, giving the film more credit than it deserves.

I never played the trading cards this was based on, but given the horrible reception in this god-awful flick, I would definitely play those than watch this crap! The reason why I'm giving this a 1/10 is because of one-saving grace. The garbage pail kids looked exactly like the ones from the trading cards. The costume designs on them are nicely detailed, but the animaltronics on them were both ugly and terrible they looked like something out of a Chuck E Cheese restaurant.So, what's wrong with the rest of this movie? EVERYTHING! And when I mean, everything, you that I exactly mean, everything. The story is pathetic it has too many plot holes including the pointless romance between Dodger and Tangerine, the girl who works for her boss named Juice (Good god. Tangerine? Juice? What kind of those names did those stupid writers come up with for human characters.), the garbage pail kids can easily sew some clothes, and more.The sets are lame and so hideous. I mean, come on. Toughest Bar in the World? State Home for the Ugly? Those were the most stupidest names for every location, so don't even get me started on them. The acting is horrid and the characters had no personality and no emotion whatsoever. Even Jim Cummings, one of the most talented actors, was wasted it makes me want to spread some tears from my eyes. The jokes are completely gross and unfunny. It also has some generic, uninspiring, and lifeless music and the song We Can Do Anything was terrible and a Heigh-Ho knockoff.Overall, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies in the history in cinema and pure trash. My advice to all of you people is to avoid this crap and watch something good because lord knows that you're trying to do better.

And the Garbage Pail Kids were pretty cool, since they came in the form us trading cards, and they were characters with all sorts of crude powers or characteristics, however you want to define it. So, I thought it would pretty cool to check out the movie. What a mistake.This was the first time I ever saw McKenzie Astin (little bro to Sean Astin). The Garbage Pail Kids, these awkward, disgusting puppets who suddenly originate from Green Toxic goo, are ready for some damage. The little arbitrary anarchists are portrayed with both with contempt (they're just some disgusting characters) and sympathy (no one likes the little buggers). Astin plays the little bugger that befriends the weirdos and yada...yada...yada...lesson learned. As many viewers have already commented, I would rate this somewhere lower than much of the junk films on the bottom 100 list on IMDb.There was a Garbage Pail Kids cartoon that was to be aired on CBS in 1988, the year after this movie was released. But, that was about the same time that a group of women (who I might say, rightly) argued that TV was rotting kids brains, since the networks were using all the publicly owned airwaves to host a bunch of cartoons aimed at blatant commercialism. If the proposed cartoons were as bad as this movie, then maybe it is just as well.

It deals with some freak mutant kids portrayed by midgets in suits becoming friends with poor kid Dodger. They begin helping him make ugly 80s clothes so he can impress this 14 year old fashion designer by the name of Tangerine. Everything about this movie is horrible, but it's actually pretty easy to watch for how bad it is. It is such a terrible movie, it's actually funny, similar to cult classic Troll 2. Along with being a bad movie, it's also amazingly crude. This would never pass as a kid's movie nowadays. The main Garbage Pail Kids each have their own unique disgusting traits, like farting, puking, peeing, popping pimples, looking like an alligator, etc. The character that seemed to be the cool one of the group (Greaser Greg) is a great role model for kids constantly pulling out his switch blade. These characters are outcasts because they're ugly, and one of the people is out casted because he is Too Crippled. I think the worst funniest part of the movie is where the kids sing that we can do anything by working with each other as they steal machines to help Dodger impress Tangerine (Her boyfriend's name is Juice). Overall this is an odd film to make for kids, and is a bad one too, but I find it so bad it's funny, so maybe you will too.My rating BOMB/****. 94 mins. PG for very crude humor.

The movie was not promoted at all and barely hit the theaters (it wasn't even at the theater a full week where I lived at the time), so it quickly found its way to video shelves.  The majority of the public never knew anything about it.  I saw it during it's initial release, and even as a 11 year-old kid, I was majorly disappointed.  Astin, Newley, and the lovely Barberi did an incredible job with the weak script they were handed -- but the story was so bare, it seemed like they were making it up as they went along.  The costumes for the kids themselves were innovatively designed, but they lacked any sort of depth past their freaky looks.  So the movie drags on as an annoying string of one-liners and gross-outs.  You never really care one way or another for the kids.  If I was going to watch a movie like that, I'd rather stick with the somewhat amusing Meet the Feebles.  No, Garbage Pail Kids is not a great movie, but it's definitely not the worst I've ever seen.

This is considered one of the worst movies ever, not bad as in fun to watch, but so bad you feel like rushing to the toilet to vomit or you want bang your head so hard that you forget you ever saw it. Where do I even begin with the flaws?1) The Garbage Pail Kids movie has a story I don't mind that a movie based on toys have stories in them, because sometimes they succeed (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), but this doesn't even try. It's about a boy named Dodger who is getting bullied nonstop, then the Garbage Pail Kids come in and do what they can to make him popular with one of the girls and see whatever beauty is in her or them. The Garbage Pail Kids were trading cards and not meant to have a story. It's a form of art, something to look at and admire the artist's talent. It was meant to satirize the Cabbage Patch Kids and have fun making disgusting looking kids. It is near impossible to make a well thought out story with these characters, but the film shows how much of a rush the writers were to get this film over with rather than take real time and effort to try and make something good. 2) The story goes into the same pattern of clich√©s suspenseful beginning, meet our uninteresting protagonist, he's got a crush and a wise old sage, we meet our secondary characters when things are at the worst for our hero, something goes right for him, the secondary characters have their filler time, something goes horrible for them, liar revealed, a final climax, and the secondary characters go off to conclude the movie reminding us that the film's suppose to be all about them. It gets annoying after dozens of movies following the same formula with no originality, and this is clearly no exception. 3) Pointless filler This is where the writers knew they had nothing to work with. It's hard enough trying to make a movie about the trading card characters, but they don't even try to work them into the story and instead give them a pointless campout scene, car rides, a song number (I kid you not and it's the only song number), and more unending dialogue and digustingness between the kids. You could fast forward each moment and you wouldn't really be missing any of it. Though really, that is what the entire movie is made up of, so it really doesn't matter.4) The movie has a phoned in moral This is possibly the movie's worst quality outside of the horrifying puppetry and annoying story arc. The sage looking after the kids keeps telling them that there's no such thing as ugly, just uniqueness, all while thinking about how to trap them back into the garbage pail where they came from and telling them to hide from the normies (or normal people). Kids watching this trying to learn self esteem won't get it from this movie because it's unintentionally teaching kids Hide your talents and yourself from the world, everybody hates you. If you wanted a movie or story that taught kids about the beauty within theme better, how about looking at Hunchback of Notre Dame, Ugly Duckling, Beauty and the Beast, and so on. Those stories knew how to teach kids that despite how they look or what the world might think of them, there's something special within them. The people (or authors) who guide the characters into believing it stay true to it and never retract it by acting ashamed of them or discouraging them. This movie just simply doesn't care. Not only does the movie treat the Garbage Pail Kids as ugly from the outside, but they have no heart, no soul, and no pity. They're all one dimensional, stereotypical, violent, and disgusting little monsters. Those are only the basics of what infuriates me about this movie. What more can I really say about it? It's just bad.

At this point, they had some minor hits with Valley Girl, Teen Wolf and Night of the Comet, but were never a major player. Not surprisingly, within two years of this film coming out, they were defunct.Rod Amateau directed, produced, and co-wrote the film. He had not made any other films of note, but had a distinguished career going back decades in television. Interestingly, this was his final film -- despite living almost another 20 years. Was it a career killer? Amateau had as his right-hand man John Carl Buechler, which was the right choice, although given the film's focus on puppets, Buechler's involvement (not to mention Phil Fondacaro) give it the feeling of a Charles Band film. And that is never a good thing.In fact, Buechler was involved before even Amateau, and in some ways had more to do with the final product. Apparently the Chiodo Brothers (Killer Klowns) were contacted and passed, and next in line was John Carl Buechler, who was fresh off of Troll. He was briefly considered as not just the effects guy but also the director, but his vision was too dark. He thought of the Kids as monsters, not something lovable, and the studio disagreed. He reflects, The best stuff in the movie is them farting and blowing snot on each other... but it had to walk this line of being a gentle fairy tale. He thinks the blend was a bad idea, and he is probably right.Buechler was the one who brought in Phil Fondacaro, and Phil brought in the little people he knew. So indirectly, Buechler not only created the Kids, but provided the actors who would play them. Buechler also brought in John Criswell, who had done effects for Re-Animator and From Beyond, and has since gone on to bigger things like The hangover. And William Butler, who is a terrible human being, but an important part of horror history, with all that he has designed, written, directed and acted in since the mid-80s.The film was universally panned, receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews, and is widely considered to be one of the worst films ever made. Caryn James of The New York Times called the film too repulsive for children or adults of any age, and it sits very, very low on both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. This abysmal (and fair) criticism aside, 2015-2016 welcomed a small resurgence of Garbage Pail Kids, with new cards coming out, and a very positive retrospective written in HorrorHound magazine. Indeed, the film can now be looked back upon as a strange moment in 1980s history, or what star Mackenzi Astin calls what-the-f***ery.Scream Factory found this to be the right time to release the film on blu-ray, and if there ever was a right time this may have been it. The film, as truly awful as it is, does seem better now (2016) than when it first came out. Even as a child I thought it was terrible, but now it has just a twinkle of nostalgia to make it palatable. The Scream disc comes with a few interviews of varying length and quality. The brief interview with Buechler is good, as he is not afraid of being honest. The real gem of this release, however is the interview with Mackenzie Astin. He talks freely for approximately 30 minutes and has countless stories to share about his father, his co-stars and more. If the movie might not be enough to make you buy the disc, his interview should be.

I think much of it is because many of these films are unintentionally funny. Plus, with my love for foreign and silent films, I sometimes long for something mindlessly different...and at least The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is mindless!Before I get to the film, I should probably mention exactly what the Garbage Pail Kids were. In the 1980s, Topps came up with a new sort of collectible card...the Garbage Pail Kids. They were rude, disgusting and exactly what kids loved! In other words, the more adults hated them and thought they were awful, the more kids wanted them and they were, briefly, popular. So, some idiot at some studio actually came up with the bright idea to turn these repulsive characters into movie stars! And, in the process, they pretty much destroyed the popularity of the cards! Here's whyWhen the film starts, some incredibly white bread-looking 'thugs' push around some dopey kid. To his aid come the Garbage Pail Kids...things that live in a garbage can in Captain Manzini's shop. The guy, surprisingly, is played by a real actor, Anthony Newley and it's sad that it's his final film. The Kids are very disgusting...wetting themselves, eating fingers and eyes, are covered with huge zits, snot and the like. Despite their looks (which we'll talk more about soon), they are helpful and enable the dopey kid, 'Dodger', to successfully overcome some unrealistic situations and problems.The biggest problem with the film are the technical problems in making the Kids look like the stickers. The stickers were grotesque and the movie TRIED to make the characters look just like the stickers...but the technology of the 1980s just wasn't up to the task. The characters are not only gross (as they should have been) but creepy and hellish--like something out of a nightmare. This is heightened by the lifeless quality of the costumes--with faces that barely move when they talk and this alone makes the vomit, urine and snot look downright nice by comparison! Nowadays, they could use CGI or better traditional special effects to make better characters...though why would they want to bother? I say this because although the characters are hellish, the plot of the film is incredibly dull and would have bored all the kids who saw it...but fortunately, few did. So overall, you have annoying characters that look almost demonic involved in a plot that bores the life out of the audience...so much that the offensive elements seem almost like a welcome relief! Awful, misguided and stupid...with nothing that even approaches entertainment for even the most easy to please viewer.

Dodger falls in love with Tangerine after she comes into the shop, and then takes him to a night club. Meanwhile, the Kids just cause random havoc for no reason at all. Dodger returns back to the Kids at the antique shop and they give him a jacket they sewed and it impress Tangerine. Tangerine asks Dodger to get more clothes so that she can sell them and have a fashion show to show them off. The Kids cause more havoc by going to a theater that plays Three Stooges shorts and behave obnoxiously. Two of them go to and start a fight at, The Toughest Bar in the World, and get free drinks. They steal a sewing machine while singing a song about working together to help make more clothes for Dodger. Tangerine finds out about the kids and is repulsed by them. She goes so far as to have Juice and her gang take them to, The State Home for the Ugly, where ugly people are caught and killed for being to ugly for society. Tangerine even betrays Dodger showing him that her heart still belongs to Juice. Captain Manzini frees the Kids and they head to the fashion show to ruin it. Dodger fights Juice and the models are stripped from the clothes they're wearing. Later, Tangerine apologizes to Dodger and asks him to be his friend, but Dodger refuses. Finally, Dodger and Captain Manzini try to sing a song backwards to get rid of the Kids, but the magic backfires, and the Kids ride into the night to cause more havoc. That's the film. If anyone is reading this, I spared moments of your life that you can use to do better things with than to watch this movie. Trust me, you're not missing out on anything. I have only seen other reviews on this film, plus Nostalgia Critic's review on it and believe me when I say that it's enough to convince me. He was right. Bad directing, writing, acting, pacing, atmosphere, technical production set-up, and music, with no story, character, plot, enjoyment, humor, charm, good visuals designs, good impact, believability, likability, re-watch value, effort, or anything. Nothing in this film makes any sense. We don't know where the Kids came from or even what they are, making the floating space ship scene in outer space in the beginning of the film pointless. Nothing is even fun to look at, including all the bad 1980's fashion that just makes the characters look ridiculous. Every shot in this movie is shot very dark, which kind of symbolizes this film in general. The moral this movie (if it even has one) is that there is no such thing as ugly, but this film is that it does the exact opposite of what it's trying to preach to kids. None of the characters are likable, especially the Kids. One has a pocket knife, another feeds off of human toes, and one pees his pants a lot. On top of that their mouths never fully close, making them look creepy. The State Home for the Ugly has Gandhi for being too bald, Abraham Lincoln for being too skinny, Santa Claus for being too fat, a clown for being too silly, and even five innocent guys for being too old, weird, hairy, pale, and crippled. Wow, this film is every definition of the word ugly and has convinced me that there is ugly in this world. It's surprising that this was the last film by director Rod Amateau, it's even more surprising that this film isn't number one on the bottom 100 movies of the IMDb, and it didn't get a single Razzie award. This mean, rotten, ugly, dark, cruel, and harsh film is like being a kid, getting kidnapped, getting put in a dark and scary chamber, then getting tortured, molested, and raped, all while being recorded live on the deep web, having to kill the people who did it, walking out of the chamber traumatized into the sunlight, realizing no matter what good thing happens to you now, it will never heal the scars that you experienced. They will always be there, forever. It's just pure torture to anyone, and it's a kids film, too! Kids, anybody, even I could make a better film than this. If anyone says to you that they have seen the worst movie ever and it's not this, immediately tell that person is wrong. This is the Holocaust of cinema and even worse than Manos. I even watched that movie. Yeah, Manos is bad, but it had it's excuses. GPK had a budget and was for kids, while Manos didn't have a budget and wasn't for kids. Just because this movie was a card game doesn't mean this film was doomed to fail from the start. It could have been possible to pull at least something out of the water with a concept like making a trading card game into a movie. Pokemon had trading cards and it succeeded. So, don't tell me that. I mean sure it wouldn't have been Oscar worthy, but at least there would have been something salvageable to be found in this film. Sadly, this film has nothing salvageable. Nothing! Don't watch this movie if you plan on eating, if you are eating, if you have eaten, if you don't want to lose your IQ, if you don't want to lose all faith in humanity, or if you want to keep your soul. This is the absolute worst film ever made in cinema history.

Thirty year olds saying give me your lunch money. only gets the reaction of GET A JOB! but anyway, he works (I use the term loosely) at an antique shop. The owner (Anthony Newley, the only person who looks like he's trying) says to this kid not to open a Garbage pail and compares it to Pandora's Box. When he gets bullied by the thirty year olds again (Seriously! What the hell is wrong with these people?) they inadvertently open it.Then after they find seven disgusting kids the plot moves to being about either them finding their friends (at, get this The State Home For The Ugly. I am not joking!) and the kid trying to impress one of the bullies girlfriends by using the Garbage Kids to sew clothes so she can sell them.So what is wrong with this movie? It is disgusting, these kids vomit, fart, urinate themselves and pretty much anything you can find to make things more and more disgusting. It's also very mean spirited. The message seems to be it's what's on the inside that counts. but these kids, aside from doing disgusting things also steal things, attack others (one of them holds them at knife point) and basically commit other felonies. Is this really the kind of movie that was going to be shown to kids? That is insane.So if you want to watch it then that's fine. It is not a movie for kids. The costuming is awful, as is the effects for the kids. If you are going to show your kids then go watch something like Willy Wonka, Return To Oz, Labyrinth, MirrorMask or...

Essentially, they were the Cabbage Patch Kids made for boys. Instead of unnervingly cute dolls, they were fun and gross collections of art printed on cards, like baseball cards. Printed by Topps, who made baseball cards. And no, they weren't like those modern Garbage Pail Kids, the ones we had in the 80's were fvcking nasty. Cards laden with feces, vomit, mutilation of others, self-mutilation, gore, violence, and just about the sickest crap you could come up with. That's why they were so great. The recent GPK cards they've made are just plain stupid. Trust me, these new cards are like making a PG-rated Predator film. That's how tame they are compared to the past ones.Of course, as with anything that's even remotely popular, some genius decides that, hey, there should be a movie to go along with this latest fad. Now, a lot of things that seemed like fads or trends that get turned into movies typically get turned into&#133; crappy movies. And this has to be one of the worst. The rude, crude, vile, disgusting, offensive Garbage Pail Kids are little more than gross misunderstood aliens who&#133; (sigh) live in a garbage can.

A lower-lever trading card such as the Garbage Pail Kids is hardly likely to make great cinema. If this sort of thing cannot appeal to you (I have broad tastes and I'm a bit too understanding of flawed films) then don't even bother watching.I wanted to rent this movie when I was a kid but my grandmother (who always evaluated the videos first) thought it looked quite inappropriate (I subsequently went for Rambo First Blood Part II, which she thought was more fitting for a 7-year-old). Since it's one and only incarnation on video tape in the late-80s (theatrical prints promptly vanished) this film has been totally non-existent. Luckily (if you like this sort of thing) MGM bought the rights, found a dusty print and spruced it up to give us a brand new digital incarnation of The Garbage Pail Kids Movie. With erm...garbage like this getting a DVD release I must ask where the hell is Bigfoot and Howard the Duck? Direcor Rodney Amateau (a rather fitting-sounding surname) could have made this an animated movie (eg Care Bears) but no, he actually had the audacity and nerve to attempt it in live action. Note how I said 'attempt' and not 'succeed'.The animatronics are just horrible. Where is Jim Henson when you need him. So bad is the puppetry that the kids cannot even close their mouths and no one even bothered to lip-sync the dialogue. They are also disgusting beyond reason (as one who is familiar with the trading cards would expect). But after while they tend to grow on you (like an ulcer) and if you switch your brain off you might find that the film is alright.There's nothing magical here. Even for a film packed with horrendously 80s fashion and production design there isn't even much nostalgic appeal. The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is certainly nothing like The Dark Crystal or even Ewoks Caravan of Courage. Hell, it's even many leagues beneath Masters of the Universe. But, if curiosity takes control of you and you simply MUST own the film then go ahead.

I can't say I remembered much from the film but there were a few scenes here & there that seemed familiar, anyway The Garbage Pail Kids is generally considered one of the worst films ever made amongst regular movie goers but as a bad film I found it somewhat enjoyable despite being terrible. The film lasts for 96 minutes & despite being pretty awful in every conceivable way I had great fun with it & I certainly wasn't bored, the script is a mess that is so uneven & misjudged it's difficult to understand. Some of the jokes & gags are tasteless & bordering on perverted. From Messy Tessy & her snot problem to Windy Winston who farts loudly all the time to Ali Gator who just wants to eat people toes these kids lack basic social manners. There are some uncomfortable moments as well, like the fourteen year old Dodget getting excited when Tangerine changes shirts or when he has a bath & someone notes that he has 'nice legs' (this is a fourteen year old boy!) in a suggestive manner, Dodger is beaten up & mugged in broad daylight yet no-one helps him & the bizarre concept of the state home for the ugly which is played in creepy & sinister seriousness is just wrong. The whole film is wrong, the story is all over the place with a strange mortality tale at it's heart that seems to be building up to a feel good happy ending but doesn't particularly end well for anyone as the bullies are beaten, Tangerine is exposed, Dodger is left heartbroken & the garbage pail kids ride off into the distance to cause more havoc after their friends are killed back at the state home for the ugly.The Garbage ail Kids Movie really has to be seen to be believed, there's even a musical number about halfway through as the kids break out into song. There's a bit of gore as Ali Gator eats eyeballs & severed toes, some very tasteless moments like Windy Windston ripping some loud farts & Valerie Vomit finally projectile vomiting green sick over a couple of people. But then again without these moments this would have been as boring as they come. The special effects vary, the kids are really odd looking, they just look sort of weird & creepy & freaky. They are sort of cartoon monstrosities brought into the real world, they have little movement as far as facial features go which gives them a strange stiffness. They all look quite rubbery & surreal yet I ended up quite liking them. Despite being cast as great fashion designers the clothes on show are awful & where did the names of these people come from? Who exactly calls someone Tangerine? The whole film is very 80's & for that I am not complaining. The opening sequence is bizarre & a features a spaceship shaped like a garbage pail that wobbles all over the place like one of the strings holding it up has broken! Totally random & has nothing to do with the rest of the film.With a lifetime gross of just over $1,500,000 this was a huge flop (although it was barely released) so the news that a new Garbage Pail Kids Movie is to be made seems a gamble but it's one I'd like to see considering the advances in technology & special effects.

The garbage pail kids sing. Granted, Fraggle Rock it is not, but I dug it.The bad things There was a rather plausible plot going on with Tangerine (the girl) taking advantage of our younger hero for her own ends. Yes, yes, his heart will be broken, blah blah. It's predictable but it was working. You can't expect much more from an 80s film like this. All you want is a halfway plausible plot so you can sit back and enjoy the total 80s-ness of it all.What ruins it, unfortunately, is the kids themselves. Not plotwise, though it does get stretched out a bit at times. What is irritating -- and, in my opinion, the biggest marring of an otherwise averagely bad film -- is the horrendous voice acting. It is beyond fake. It is way past exaggerated and juvenile. It is just not professional at all.But what grates on the nerves the most in these cases, where you basically have puppets/creatures/dolls etc, is when the voices and character given them is a complete throaway. A flimsy stereotype that makes the eyes glaze over rather than make the interest peak. And what did we choose for the kids, you ask? Illiterate black ghetto talk.It is done to such an inanely over the top degree that you just want to scream. Almost every single one of these voices sound like someone trying to do a bad joke of the most illiterate ghetto trash they can possibly think of -- while attempting to show off at the same time.Friends, let me tell you something if you have the slightest bit of education or self-respect, listening to this type of -- pardon the expression -- garbage-speak is a constant distraction. People who are perhaps not American and do not know what black ghetto trash talk like will probably not be bothered by this. They might even think it's cute 'cause it's so American. The rest of us, however, were left unamused.Shame, 'cause the film is really no worse than any other dumb 80s film of its kind, such as Goonies or Howard the Duck. But the dumb illiterate English and the cultural depravity with which the voices are undeniably connected makes a perfect bad film, well... bad.

I was shocked when a friend of mine said it had been and even more shocked to see it was on the MGM label!They've done a nice widescreen transfer and cleaned up the soundtrack. There's no extra's but i think that's pushing it.The only reason i bought this was for nostalgic viewing. I'd only ever seen the movie once when it came out and i was lucky then as the video was pulled from shelves here in the UK. I remember loving it as a child....now i'm an adult.....this film is bad. It's one of those classic 80's films that the like's of which would never get made in this day and age. Whilst it is bad, TGPKM falls in to the category of 'so bad, it's good'. I don't need to go into the story as others have covered the basics.I will say that upon second viewing so many years later i found myself cringing. The music, story, effects and acting are all cheesy. It's like watching a twisted evil version of the Tweenies....but i also found myself laughing at it's silliness, and this is what makes the film so great! If you've never seen it or never collected the cards that the film derived from then i'd say give it a miss.If like me though, you enjoy cheesy 80's flicks with bad acting/story and like to stroll down memory lane to revisit those films you really enjoyed when you were younger...then it's must see!Now, if only someone would release Howard The Duck on DVD....

To make an effective Garbage Pail Kids movie, I'm thinking it would have had to have been very surreal, and much much more grotesque. The main problem with the movie is that they barely focus on the raunchy aspects of the Kids which is the ONLY thing that made the cards popular. So instead, you get a really bad story about some kid who likes an older chick who is a fashion designer, and wants to impress her. For SOME REASON, the Kids have the ability to make really hip clothes, so the main kid pretends like he made them in order to get closer to her. Oh, and her name is Tangerine by the way. Totally sweet! Right? On the side of this unentertaining plot, the Kids will on occasion fart, burp, puke, and smell bad. Oh, and sing really, really horrible songs - that aren't even about anything gross. Why is ALI GATOR a guy???? WHAT are the Garbage Pail Kids and why do they float in a garbage can in outer space? Who is this magician, WHY does he have the pail, why does he care about the kids, and why is the main kid friends with him??? Why does the main kid have a crush on a chick 10 years older then him???

There's only one way to describe a movie like The Garbage Pail Kids movie, and that way is with bizarre or one of its many synonyms.It's absolutely astonishing that a movie studio would fund, produce, and widely distribute this picture to theatres. The script is, in a word, abysmal. Dozens of obvious questions are raised at the outset; Why does Dodger(our hero) virtually live at Mancini's Antique Shop? How has said shop stayed in business having not sold a single item in months? Why does a twentysomething looking goon continue spend his life picking on a 14 year old wimp? All of these questions are quickly relegated to the back-burner when one sets eyes on the Garbage Pail Kids for the first time. Aside from most of the kids being hideous(Nat Nerd and Valerie Vomit in particular), the puppetry is atrocious. Dialogue is rarely lip synced, and when it is the mouth movements are incredibly stiff. Amazingly, poor quality of the costumes is paled only by the stupidity of the film's plot,revolving around Dodger's efforts to woo Tangerine away from Juice, the same goon who keeps chasing Dodger around and stealing his lunch money. Fortunately for Dodger, the titular Garbage Pail Kids are apparently endowed by their Creator with unsurpassed fashion design skills, the very same skills Tangerine is trying to use to hit the big time and move to New York! The kids put their abilities to work and sew Dodger a hideous jacket to impress Tangerine, and before you know it we've got a love triangle of such depth not seen since...ever. Or not.Laughably bad performances abound, although even McKenzie Astin as Dodger delivers an Oscar-worthy performance in contrast to Ron MacLachlan as Juice, who delivers unequivocally the worst performance I have ever seen in a non-pornographic motion picture.All of this is overshadowed by the scenes of the Garbage Pail Kids general tomfoolery, which includes such wacky hijinks as stealing a Pepsi truck, breaking into a sweat shop while singing We Can Do Anything by Working With Each Other!, roasting hot dogs over an open fire, causing mayhem in a movie theatre, and most incredibly, participating in a biker bar brawl, kicked off by driving an ATV straight through the window. I am not being hyperbolic in the least when I describe each and every one of these scenes as a unique spectacle in the history of cinema. I cannot imagine there will ever be a film made with a more innately weird quality than this one. If you have any curiosity whatsoever about this film, I recommend you see it. There truly isn't and most likely never will be another experience in cinema quite like watching The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.

She must have watched it a hundred times. And all the neighbor kids would come over to watch it. The fact that she loved it made me love it too. Plus I actually liked it. Forget all the technical flaws, it was a good story, with some funny stuff going on. Very cleverly done. I love it when Aligator is checking out all the toes and the bar. Too fat, too skinny, ah tasty looking toes. And it has a good message for kids about dealing with peer presure and feelings of love. I still recommend this movie to parents I meet today. I am glad to hear it is available on DVD, and plan to get a copy right away. Great to give kids something to watch during an family gathering.

Surprisingly enough, i didn't see what the big deal was. It's not exactly top stuff, i must admit, but at the same time it doesn't really deserve a prize for Worst Movie. I can see why not everybody would enjoy it-even if you are a true fan of the Garbage Pail Kids trading cards, it could have the opposite effect on you and make you hate it, as many fans seemingly do. Unlike their portrayal on the gross cards, the kids in the movie are not as disgusting, quite the opposite-i personally found them to be hilarious and actually adorable, me, who hated the cards so much that i threw the 2 ones i found then forgot about them. If i had been born a couple of decades earlier, i may even have been one of those parents who disapproved of their kids GPK cards collection. Reading reviews which trashed the movie I did get quite a negative impression of it, but nevertheless decided to watch it myself before passing severe judgement on it. Although gross, I found this movie quite amusing (and I'm somebody who HATES gross stuff). I'm an 80s kid myself so this nostalgic movie appealed to me. The kids are portrayed by midget actors in costumes, which made it more interesting and more creative than the dreaded CGI effects of today (sorry to anyone who does like CGI, this is my personal opinion).I recommend this movie to the nostalgic or for people with broad tastes in film, which would accommodate this wacky 80s kids movie.

It's cinematography at times is quite ambiotic. The only problem is that the movie needed more goblins.SPOLIersThe movie is about seven dwarfs and 5 goblins who have a mission to sleep with 25 fairies and monkey butlers. However things go horribley wrong when Gargamel comes up with an evil plan to rid the world of smurfs. The thing is the smurfs do not have any protection so they enlist the help of skeletor to protect them but he cant cause he is fighting with he-man. Now this is the interesting part, the goblin havre 7 days to get the faries otherwise the goblin city (hantra) will die.This movie is not oscar worthy but it should of picked up a few emmys at least.

It's a movie about the hugely popular trading card characters, The Garbage Pail Kids. So if your looking for a hart warming story about a loner boy and the growing pains of adolescents, well then you've got the wrong movie. This movie is for those with little to no maturity what-so-ever. It has fart jokes, snot jokes and a few cannibalism jokes too. If you want to take a night off from any brain activity pop this movie in your DVD player, sit back, relax and enjoy the cheese of your yesteryear.

It was really raunchy which made it even more better. Not a girly girl movie, but a tomboy movie maybe. My brother enjoyed it as well.......... I don't know if my sister enjoyed it or not, but she was one of those girly girls and she is 7 years older then I am but to me it was one of the best movies I have ever seen and I can't wait to see it again. It's a hard movie to find especially at the video stores and all. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have............ So see the movie already!!!!

If you hate this movie, you must have been compared to the garbage pail kids when you were young. Even if that happened, you still shouldn't hate the Garbage Pail kids. Yes, this movie wasn't designed with the greatest plot. But its based off of trading cards with ugly creatures on them! The characters are absolutely original and no films since have been able to re-create anything close to comparison. Perhaps those of you who hated this film enjoy watching a film that is exactly the same as all those before it. This movie reminded me of my childhood as did it for many, many friends of mine. To hate something so unique carries no credibility in my mind. Everyone should watch this movie at least once and I am forever grateful that it was finally released on DVD. A must have in every DVD library. "}]
