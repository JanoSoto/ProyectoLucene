Seeing it again, not in my teenage years anymore, I realize that 'She's All That' really is for teenagers. I still like it, yes, but now that I have seen so many more movies there are a lot of predictable, therefore lesser, parts.For starters it is set on a high school but the characters seem to be in their mid-twenties. Of course that is pretty logical since the actors are in their mid-twenties. Well, Rachael Leigh Cook was only twenty, and I have to admit that she is the main reason to see this movie if you are a guy. Freddie Prinze Jr. is her love interest and personally I think he is one of the most annoying actors out there, no exception here.The whole story is very predictable actually. Prinze is the most popular guy on their high school, just dumped by his beautiful girlfriend. Now he makes a bet with a friend he can turn any girl into a prom queen. The friend selects the girl and of course he chooses Rachael Leigh Cook. Convenient for Prinze, since she already is a beautiful girl. It does not really matter whether she wears glasses and floppy pants. Of course he really falls in love with her, of course the bet comes out, of course the girl is mad, of course the movie end on the prom, and of course it will be a happy ending.Yes, predictable it is, but also sweet, even with an actor like Prinze. Sometimes it is funny and when you are watching a romantic comedy all you really want, I guess, is the main characters get together in a nice way. That sort of happens. A teenager will probably love it, but others will not completely waste their time.

A friend takes her up on the bet and picks geeky art student Laney.  Zak tries to get close with limited success but gradually he begins to get to know her and they become friends &#150; now all he has to do is get her accepted by the jet set.How many teen movies do we need, with their similar themes of jocks and geeks and the seemingly revolving casts?  Here we get yet another retelling of Pygmalion except here it doesn't really convince as a comedy or a story.  The plot isn't particularly imaginative and feels lifeless and a little flat as a result like it has no spark of it's own.  The other problem is the fact that Laney is actually quite good looking before `the change' &#150; I prefer her look before Zak supposedly made her better.The film needs to pander to the teen audience so we get the obligatory `gross out' comedy in a few scenes which are funny but outside of that it's really very light melodrama between Zak, Laney and the jocks/cheerleaders.Prince is annoying but is actually alright here despite having a cardboard jock character.  Cook is good as Laney but it's a shame that the film sees some sort of victory of making this geeky arty girl into a beautiful Valley girl type that conforms to the pack.  What message does that send out to teenagers?  At one point Zak says that he'd rather work with fat or ugly than Laney &#150; but really she is only acceptable because she is pretty and not fat or ugly.  The rest of the cast are a range of teen actors who you'll recognise from other films who do nothing out of the ordinary.  Usher has a cool cameo &#150; but why did Lil' Kim take a role that was barely a support character?  I hate Matthew Lillard with a passion but here he does a good job sending up those reality TV `celebrities' and is very funny in his handful of scenes.Overall this is an acceptable teen film but really never gets to the point where you could call it more than good.  The story lacks spark or imagination and the comedy is either crude or too slight to be funny.  It's watchable but it's not all that.

But I really shouldn't be, you know? It's a formulaic, stereotypical movie about high school and teenagers. In short, it's another teen movie (Not Another Teen Movie - get it?). But there is something disarming about She's All That. It's sweet, it's funny, it's cute, it's charming, and it's kind of innocent (in its own unique way, of course).OK, maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic with calling this movie innocent, but I'm making these judgments because this is a movie that I've always admired since it first came out in 1999 - I was 14 and in middle school that year, so I was definitely within its target audience - and I eagerly rented it on VHS from Blockbuster Video after being released on home video. Regrettably, I never really watched it again after that for some reason; I really wish I could come up with a reasonable explanation, but I honestly have none. (As an aside, a few months ago I purchased the movie on Blu-ray DVD and I finally had the opportunity to watch the movie in its entirety for the first time in 12 years.)I personally feel that, unlike many of the teen comedies released on the tail end of the oh-so-cynical seen-it-all '90s, She's All That was one of the far better movies from that time. It was incredibly well-acted (by its wholesome, good-looking leads, played by Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook), well-written (by R. Lee Fleming, Jr), and directed (by Robert Iscove). I felt that the budding romantic chemistry between the two leads was real and believable. Additionally, the characters, especially Cook's character, Plain Jane art student Laney Boggs, seemed real, three-dimensional, and sympathetic.I single out Rachael Leigh Cook because this was really her movie all the way. In other words, she simply wasn't running her character through the motions of Fleming's script, and she made Laney Boggs all her own - a living, breathing human being and not a brown-eyed, brunette-haired bombshell. She doesn't go from zero to 10 in the time it takes for you to zip up your jacket, no (even though in the real world, it would be utterly ridiculous for her to be considered, even in her ugly duckling stage, anything less than very, very pretty; all she needs to do is lose the glasses, do her hair, and update her wardrobe and she's done - instant prom queen status). Her transformation into a beauty queen is something that is seen as a gradual process and is full of real effort on her part. In other words, She really is All That.At the beginning of the film, all-American jock - star soccer player - and class president and essentially nice good-guy Zack Siler (Prinze, Jr.) is publicly dumped by his shallow, self-absorbed girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) for an annoying reality TV star from The Real World named Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard, of Scream). Zack bets with his best friend Dean (Paul Walker) that he can turn any girl in the school into a prom queen in six weeks. Dean chooses Laney Boggs. Predictably, Zack starts to fall for Laney - especially after his younger sister Mackenzie (Anna Paquin) gives her an extreme makeover - and soon finds himself questioning his bet with Dean.As I stated earlier, there isn't a whole lot to the plot that hasn't been seen before in earlier, better teen pictures (like, say, for instance, 1987's Can't Buy Me Love, which this film could be considered in some ways a modern update of). But what saves it are its performances from two real, likable characters who are given a chance on-screen to really learn from each other, and learn ABOUT each other and make some unique discoveries about themselves in the process. It's just a quality that I wish more teen films shared these days.She's All That - It really is All That, and then some more.8/10 "},{"Title":"worth watching for Rachel Leigh Cook","Date":"4 April 2009","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" There are some movies that make me just stop what I'm doing and watch. Braveheart, Clear and Present Danger, Casino Royale, Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, Top Gun are just a few that come to mind. Not all are classics, but all have _something_ to them that engrosses me. She's All That is one of those movies.Yes, Rachel Leigh Cook is so so cute. Fuggedaboudat. Watch her. See if she delivers one line as if she memorized it, as if she's repeating what someone else wrote. There's not one unnatural act or utterance from her. She is completely believable, and because her character rings so true, you cannot help but empathize with her, and that is what makes the movie -- when she wins out in the end, you're happy she did because she makes you care about her. She's as good as Kate Blanchett was in The Aviator (completely different movies, completely different roles, by Blanchett deservedly won an Oscar). She has that character absolutely nailed, you won't see - can't see -- a better performance.(And for what it is worth, this may be Paul Walker's best performance. I credit the director for getting the performances that he did out of cast of young actors not generally known for their talent.) As for the rest of the movie, you've seen it before, but so what? Star Wars is Battle of Britain, set in the future with a backstory, no one holds that against it. The choreographed dance scene is great, and it IS well cast and it IS well acted, clichéd or not.

In my opinion She's all that is one of the best movies in it's teenager/highschool/romcom genre. The story is comfortable predictable and all the performances (from Freddy Prinze to Rachel Leigh Cook and even Matthew Lillard - who's pretty hilarious) are great. We also find Paul Walker (pretty scary!) and Anna Paquin in one of their earlier roles.Director Robert Iscove also has some nice visual surprises in store for us. The way he introduces the Florida flashback at the pool may be lent from Tucker A man and his dream, but it works very well. One of the best parts is the dance scene to the music of Fat Boy Slim at the end of the movie. The choreography is excellent and the camera-work first rate. I think that scene is an absolute classic (especially since it wasn't even planned to be in the movie).All in all She's all that is pretty underrated, I think. It's difficult to make a good romantic movie, I know. I love the genre, but the only ones that really survive the test of time can be counted on one hand. Rob Reiner's The Sure Thing and When Harry Met Sally are up there. Garry Marshall's Frankie and Johnny, Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility, The Notebook and Simon West's Pride & Prejudice also come to mind.She's all that may not be a classic like the movies I mentioned before, but there's more to that movie than you would think after first seeing it.A miserable 5.4...

Freddie Prinze, Jr. plays the typical popular guy. (i guess that's because he plays soccer, that makes him popular, just like real high school, right?) Anyway, his bleached-brain friends start a bet to turn an ugly duckling into a prom queen. Unfortunately, they already picked a beautiful swan.  In fact, the movie points out that Cooke's only ugly attribute is that she wears glasses. And, naturally, we assume that glasses make her nerdy and ugly.  It would have been much more interesting if they picked an overweight girl with braces, and started an alternate day bulk-up routine and a diet of Slim-Fast, to make her skinny enough for prom-queen acceptable.  Instead, the filmmakers make it easy on themselves by simply getting the girl contacts.  The rest of the movie tries to make us believe that this is how high school students behave and act, and becomes offensive.  I hated watching the scenes of the big parties, the walking on the beach, and the unsightly hair on the pizza.  Don't any of these students take time to study and learn?  Oh, no.  Of course not.  That's what all the nerdy people do, and we're trying to make them prom queen.

Perhaps expectations were too high? Perhaps this story had been done once too often. But the odd fact (and the thrust of this review) is that the film is memorable because the stars rise above the material .... before they themselves burn out and lapse into film obscurity.It was an odd confluence of talent. Director Iscove is well respected in TV but this remains one of his only shots at a feature. Prinze, who had pretty much owned the casting niche he was in, was 23 at the time the film was made and arguably long in the tooth for a high schooler. Nonetheless the chemistry between him and Leigh-Cook was powerful and that chemistry held the movie up when the dialog and the mugging by the other actors let it down.It's all timing. Leigh-Cook never really made the transition to films after, but kept very busy with TV. Prinze never really made the transition, period, but he's still a young guy and who knows? The Pygmalion thing has been done to death but oddly Iscove, Prinze and Leigh-Cook kept it alive for one more outing. Entertaining.

Starring some upcoming stars, some of them who sadly faded into obscurity, much the same way as the ones did from American Pie, my only regret, was I should of seen this film fifteen years early. Of course my reason for watching this, was for the late Paul Walker, who I must admit, didn't do a bad job here, playing a real a..hole, typically un Walker'ish. Although there are a few clichéd moments as in the progression of the story, I still found this really entertaining, the transformation, staircase scene, that was later mocked in Not Another Teen movie, another one. The unoriginal premise has popular jock, Zack, Freddie Prince Junior, dumped by queen of popularity/vaingloried stuck up/bitch, Taylor. Now Freddie is given a wager, by friend, Dean, a sort of meathead, to change a chosen dork Walker's girl of choice), nerd, geek, rah rah rah, into the prom queen. Plain Jane, Rachel Leigh Cook, is the transformed one, where Zack, of course falls in love with her, but a bets a bet. We know how the rest of the story plays out, but the film's smart script, adds a lot of funny touches, like Laney's after school hobby, an artist venting group. Too, is a reality show starring Taylor's new love, jock idiot (Matthew Lillard), a kind of Vincent Cassell looking guy, who in one scene, makes such an a.. of himself, it was even embarrassing, watching from my end. Check out his bedroom. Here's one 99 film you must really see, a light hearted teen comedy, you can watch a few times. It has some revenge too that I liked consult Duval's new appearance, and Walker's deafened ears. I like Freddie Prince Junior too. He has a charisma, or magnetism about his presence, where I never really found him impressive as an actor, more someone who got lucky. Pollack is fun as Cook's pool installer father, while Animal House's Matheson, popping back on the screen as Zack's father, marked a nice return to the big screen. Don't knock this one.

Laney is the cliché unpretty, pretty girl who becomes the object of a bet in which Dean, play boy jerk, bets senior president, super popular, all that guy Zack that he can't make her prom queen. Like any other predictable teen 90s movie, Zack starts to fall for the out of the ordinary, quirky Laney as he gets to know her. With her help he is also able to deal with his life problems and everything is happily ever after. Many of the films targeted towards teens during this time, during anytime really, all have really similar plots. It's not like this film is a break-through or has a message so incredibly deep that the world would be lost without its insight, but as far as these movies go it isn't the worst ever. It would be good to watch with a group of friends if you're trying to be sentimental, but don't expect to feel moved by the end.

Of course his heartbroken when Zachary's girlfriend dumps him for Lillard's character. SO he decides that his mates(one played by the late Paul Walker) can change any nerdy girl into a prom queen for Zach to take to the prom as part of a bet(like that other film that was released the same year 10 things I hate about you starring the late Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles). Zach of course stumbles across a young nerdy girl played by Rachel Cook who is a rather moody individual who likes to paint and be creative. But when Zachary's sister (played by Anna Paquin)gives her a makeover,Zac falls in love with her. But is it for real or is it only for the bet?Overall it was a cute harmless chick flick and its worth checking out if you like Freddie Prinze Jr. Oh and keep an eye out for Sarah Michelle Gellar(Prinze Jr's wife in real life) and global superstar Usher aka Usher Raymond and Lil Kim(another singer) who star in this chick flick too.

Zach does not change Laney; she was always pretty but just didn't give herself the chance. This isn't a film about turning an ugly girl into a pretty girl; rather a film about putting yourself out there and allowing yourself to be pretty. To pick an unattractive actress to transform would send out the message that the only way you will ever be accepted is if you tart yourself up.The premise is quite thin and perhaps a more severe transformation would have been more entertaining but Freddie Prince Junior, as Zach, the jock who makes a bet that he can't transform the geekiest girl in the school Laney (Rachel Leigh Cook) into prom queen is charismatic and has nice chemistry with Cook. There are also some entertaining minor characters, such as Zach's sister (played by Anna Paquin) and Laney's brother.There is one gross-out scene that feels a little out of place in what is quite a gentle story about coming out from your shell; I wouldn't really describe this as a rom-com. Still, it's a good film to watch on a Friday night with a couple of friends, and it has some good morals.

Earnest, arty and committed to her family, Laney is never given a second glance by anyone. Until, of course, Zach persuades her to remove her glasses. Former 'Friends' writer Fleming supplies a sharp script (There are children in Mexico who've been up for three hours making shirts for corporate America) and the film's littered with in-jokes and sly references to film and TV, the best of which sees Zach's ex (O'Keefe) dumping him for one of the participants of MTV's 'The Real World' (Lillard).

Many of the films contain a stereotypical premise The jock/hunk, the big-breasted blonde everyone wants, the token ethic kid, the nerdy boy/girl, etc.  Many of the teen flicks produced in recent years have capitalized onthis formula.  for some reason though, She's All That, while containing some of these elements, works.Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr., in his breakthrough role) is a guy that has guys wanting to be him, and girls wanting to nail him  He's rich, smart, athletic, has a popular girlfriend, and is student body president. Everything is going great for Zach, although he hasn't chosen a college yet. The film begins when Harrison High School is gearing back up again after spring break.  Zach is looking for girlfriend Taylor Vaughn (Jodi Lynn O'Keefe), who is no where to be found.  All of a sudden, she breezes into his prescence--with a tatoo, no less--and dumps Zach.  It so happens that she has fallen for Brock Hudson, the dyslexic volleyball player (who is also fictional) from The Real World (played brilliantly by Matthew Lillard) that was ultimately kicked out of the house.  Zach makes a bet with friends Dean (Paul Walker) and Preston (Dule Hill) that he can make over any girl and make her the Prom Queen in six weeks.  The lucky girl is none other than Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), a misfit art student.  Zach slowly wins over her trust, and begins to show her a good time.  Laney, who put up a wall to avoid all of the popular kids, begins to trust Zach. When Zach begins to fall for Laney, he has to remember that this was all a bet. What will he do?I wasn't all for seeing She's All That originally.  I saw this film in January 1999 after a grueling week of high school midterms (I was a sophomore) as a means to hang out with my friends.  I didn't know who Freddie Prinze Jr. was, and had unknowlingly seen him in I Know What You Did Last Summer the year before.  After seeing this film,  I fell in love with the lanky dark-haired teen heartthrob that girls have lusted over for several years now right then and there, and have liked him ever since. Since I am not a teen movie fan (with minor exceptions--I like Breakfast Club, Fast times @ Ridgemont High--my all-time favorite, and Down to You), I wasn't drawn to this film. After seeing it though, I pushed past that conception to allow this to be a treasured film.  The acting in it is decent, and each character pulls his or her weight.  I have to admit that while Zach is my favorite character in this movie, the scenes that Matthew Lillard did truly stole the show!  Lillard is so funny, and he really acts like a doofus, obviously something he's good at.  I remember Jodi Lynn O'Keefe from Step By Step, but I had never heard of Rachel Leigh Cook (I heard she was in Carpool).My favorite scenes are the opening scene with Taylor dumping Zach and her explanation, which goes into a flashback scene at MTV's spring break celebration, where she meets Brock Hudson (Zach Brock Hudson?!  What kind of a name is Brock Hudson?  Taylor And what kind of a name is Zach? Besides, Brock is from The Real World.  Zach What, like Resceda? Taylor No, The Real World, second season), the Real World nightmare scene, Brock Hudson's crazy dance to Rick James' Give it to Me Baby, the prom with the cool Rockefeller Skank dance, the scene where Laney comes down the stairs before going to the party, the beach scene, and the end (I won't give this away, but its a treat for the ladies!)  My favorite line has to be the one that Taylor says to Zach--You didn't really think I was going off to college and still be dating you, did you?  Oh, you did?. How sweet! and the reversal of this line when Brock was breaking up with Taylor--You didn't think I was going to leave for All Star Road Rules and still be dating you, did you?  Oh, you did.  How sweet!I own the DVD of this movie, and quite frankly, it was worth the $19.99 I paid for it.  This was a great film, and I am disappointed that more people didn't give it a chance. Kudos to those who did, this film was worth watching.  This is a great chick flick or date film that's sure to appeal to both guys and girls.  With a great cast of young talent and a story that sure to invoke plenty of Ohhh, how cute! moments from gushing teenage girls, this is a teen film that is sure to be a favorite for years to come. See this film and find out why it's all that!

The writer who thought it was a good idea to have him make two bullies eat pubic hair has never spent a minute in a high school.  It's empathetically akin to Nancy Regan's Just Say No campaign.  It only appeals to adults who have forgotten what it was like to be a teenager.  Pure tripe.Kevin Pollak seems completely out of place in this film.  And that's a good thing.  He is once again at the top of his game in this film.  He injects the only genuine emotion into the picture with his role as the cliché sensitive dad.  I found myself wishing the script would follow him and his struggles as a single dad with Ally Sheedy from Breakfast Club and Forrest Gump as children.

In my opinion this mediocre romantic comedy is more than saved by the appearance of Matthew Lilard as Brock Hudson. If you love the Stiflers (American Pie) of this world then the 10mins of Matthew Lilard as the narcissistic wannabe actor with a tattoo of himself on his arm may be worth a look.

If he one iota of decency he would foregone the role of Prom King and kept Laney well away from his phony friends before it even reached Prom Night. But he selfishly didn't and showed he just wanted his moment of peer adulation from his spoilt friends. Why should comedy be had from picking on a girl who's mother had died when she was a child and didn't want to be part of the 'in' crowd. But obviously the writers believe that should be Laney's sole goal at school, was to be popular. It must have been only Rachel Leigh Cook's acting performance that kept me watching until the end of the film.

Moving along....  The party  Bathroom scene See Nowhere which was the direction the movie was going at that point.  Oh oh oh and the Prom.  I was getting flashbacks.  The Saturday Night Fever & Dirty Dancing mix was sickning.  By the way, from where did they get Tallulah Bankhead from?

I am a teenager, so I know what it is like to go to school, and this school that Zach and Laney go to seems like an unrealistic school. Ok, so they mention the clicks of your normal high school setting, thats about how realistic it got. When was the last time your friend went away on Spring Vacation and came home with a tattoo and a MTV star as a boyfriend? The plot seems to be over used too these days-- Boy against his will falls in love with girl, later on the girls feelings get hurt, they live happily ever after, as if you didn't see that coming? You don't need to sit through an hour or so movie about it.Also the actors in this movie are a bunch of pretty faces that can not act. Rachel Leigh Cook just tries (and fails in my view) to act like an adorable geek but unfortunately due to the acting skills she does not have fails at a seemingly easy job. Which reminds the public that good looks can't get you everywhere.

Were they that mean _anywhere_?I liked the fact that the popular clique were differentiated, as opposed to thinking as one and being as one. Preston was sensitive, expressing reluctance to stage the initial bet, making an effort to include Laney in the volleyball game (Is your name Laney?), and telling Dean that his attempt to score with Laney wouldn't work. Dean was basically an amoral thug who cared nothing about the thoughts of others. Zach was confused, but more or less good-hearted. Alex, Katie and Misty each had their own personality.This was a refreshing change from most teen comedies where the popular kids think and act as one.Brock was hilarious as a D-list celebrity who hasn't quite gotten over his 15 minutes of fame. The reaction of the girls to his little bit of fame was likewise hilarious.I wondered why Jesse and Laney hadn't tried to make a go of it romantically; however I was pleasantly surprised to see Jesse and Mac meet up at the prom (I was surprised, however, that Mac hadn't gotten a date of her own and went with her brother.)The race for prom queen was fun; people seemed to side with Laney for reasons of their own, ranging from Revenge of the Nerds to I'm sick of Taylor lording over us with her bitchiness. Then again, my senior prom king was elected as a joke. PThe only problem I had (and it's a biggie) with the film was that Laney made the change from geek to chic effortlessly; after the party humiliation Laney had zero problems moving into the chic crowd. (Also Rachael Leigh Cook being so dorky the other art geeks tell her to commit suicide? Puh-leeze. I mean she could've gotten a few dates on her tits alone.)Also I find it hard to believe that she'd move from telling Zach to go away without a second thought on his initial approach to just up and going to the prom with Dean, a guy she barely knew and who made zero effort to get to know her. I mean, we went from that's a HELL NO to OK ... even after the bet was revealed to her.Oh yes, and although Rockefella Skank is a cool tune, I expected the students to break out into song during that little dance number @ the prom. That was disturbing.Basically what we have here is Detroit in movie form. The central city/premise is empty and poorly done.

I really dislike the constant bombarding of teen films portraying High School life in such a stereotypical way, and with the constant obsession of the importance of getting being these 'perfect' students.....planning for the perfect future, total emphasis on a love life (have you ever noticed how in nearly all these films the kids get into the few top Universities, and how despite being only 18 at most they have Dawson Creek style meaningful 'relationships'.School just isn't as clean cut in segregating student types (geeks, jocks e.t.c), and the problems and aims of teenage life are much more complex and diverse than all these films show.  American Pie managed to overcome these similar types of flaws because it had that single advantage of being a much more constantly funny film.........with the internet scene!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Freddie Prinze Jr. is Zach, a wildly popular and admired high school senior who gets dumped by his Queen Bitch girlfriend, Taylor (the very voluptous Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) after she meets Brock, a Puck-like creature from The Real World, during Spring Break at the MTV Beach House. The character of Brock is one of the two highlights, played by the ever-entertaining Matthew Lillard. The other highlight is Rachel Leigh Cook, despite the rather ridiculous assertion that a girl this gorgeous could manage to be the school loser. They didn't even do a good job of masking her beauty, as they did with Drew Barrymore in 'Never Been Kissed'. Beautiful as Drew is, they managed to uglify her in the flashbacks scenes enough that you could believe that young Josie Geller was a geek. Here, they basically just stuck thick glasses on Rachel, and she's far too pretty a girl for that to work. Despite that strain on suspended reality, she has a certain prickly charm- her dark eyes flashing in her tiny face, smirkingly throwing Zach on stage in the one place he's entirely out of his league, stomping up like a midget warrior princess to stand face-to-cleavage with Taylor. I should also add here that although Ms. O'Keefe's performance can't really be called a highlight, she handles her thankless role with skill. This movie really seems to have attracted a lot of names in supporting roles- Usher, Lil' Kim, Anna Paquin, Paul Walker, Gabrielle Union, Kevin Pollak, the young man who played Pnub in 'Idle Hands' and his costar from 'The Mighty', Kieran Culkin. Usher and Lil' Kim did little to distinguish themselves here, other than causing me to remember just how young Lil' Kim is. Anna Paquin has a wonderful quality about her (especially evident in her performance in 'Almost Famous') that shines even here in her small, one-note role as makeup artist- a sort of sly, knowing good humor peering from the corners of her eyes, mixed with a petulant vulnerability. Sensuality is in her also, and it could be dangerous. Paul Walker was much better as a doofy dream boy in 'Pleasantville' than he is here as Zach's jerk buddy. Freddie Prinze Jr. is actually the perfect sort of actor to play Zach- cute, generic, likable and harmless. The sort of boy you'd like in high school and forget the first day of college. The movie doesn't end quite like you expect it to and, ironically, this one strike of originality was something I didn't like. Not to reveal too much, but while it's all good and well that we can't have the fairy tale ending with Zach and Laney getting crowned Prom King and Queen, I think they should have been reversed. I'll also add that I'm sorely tempted to try making a teen movie myself for no reason other than to gain evidence that there actually exist some ideas for teen movies that don't climax at the friggin' prom. I think I'll have my teen movie's climax take place at the Christmas dance.

Kieran Culkin seems to have much more acting ability than his more successful bro. He impressed me a lot in 'the Mighty'.

Well, that's enough, I'll not write anything else about 'She's All That'. Let's write about one good movie, 'Cruel Intentions'.The unique adaptation with young cast that's very good is the audacious 'Cruel Intentions'. There, they were not afraid of doing a really hot and original movie, with profanities, sex, bad attitudes, etc. The director, Roger Kumble, did what he wanted to do, without interventions or adaptations to receive one PG-13 rating.That may look obvious, but I'll write it anyway don't spend your money in this crap. I'm not saying that anyone that watch this movie will hate it but think a little with so many masterpieces to rent, all Stanley Kubrick's movies available, gripping films of Hitchcock on video, etc, why rent this? Ok, you don't like old movies. So rent Boogie Nights, Short Cuts, Schindler's List, Shakespeare in Love!

(Aside  I wonder what the writers did with the other 23 hours the day this one was written?)I bought this movie (thankfully at a discount) upon a couple of pseudo-recommendations that it was cute or a good date movie.  I'm 30 years old and married, so I thought that might be a nice one to watch with my wife.  I'm now convinced that this movie was written BY teens, FOR teens. It should have had an NC18+ rating  not suitable for anyone over 18.The only thing that surprised me about the ending was that I was still watching it.  I'll tip my hat to Freddie in the lead role.  He may get type-cast in the cool student body president role, but he plays it well enough.  I believed it (although student body presidents don't actually wield any authority to boss other students around).  Rachael is cute enough for this role, but even the dork version of her early in the movie wouldn't be a dork in any high school I remember.I also found the plot conveniently skipping along when it had to set up future scenes (e.g. Zach has issues about choosing a college, or rather choosing his father's college).  It took just 2 minutes to throw this in so he could relate better to Rachael's character.  (See, I can't even remember who she was?!)The profanity, while probably typical for today's high school crowd, didn't have to be a part of this movie.  Profanity and a cute date movie won't ever go hand-in-hand in my book.About two-thirds into the movie, I was already wondering who I could give this video away to, because I don't believe I'll need to ever see it again.

First of all, let me say I wanted to like this movie. It doesn't promise to be deep or meaningful, and I was able to enjoy it as light fare, no matter how truly cheesy some of the moments were. However, I was still soooo disappointed at some parts of this movie, I just had to cringe.If you're looking for more than stock characters in predictable situations, keep looking. Why is it movie writers think audiences older than 12 will buy the lead hunk doggedly pursuing a grouchy girl with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever (also see Julia Stiles' character in 10 Things I Hate About You).While nobody is fooled that Rachael Leigh Cook's character won't eventually clean up really well, her performance throughout is so droll and emotionless, you wonder why she's pursued when there have to be more friendly dorks somewhere in the school! Without spilling any plotlines, there's one big scene towards the end where she attempts to show some emotion and literally falls flat. I realize her character's emotions are supposed to be bottled up, but you can't help but get the sense it's just poor acting since nothing is visible under the surface.Freddie Prinze, Jr. is well cast, as he's able to simultaneously project sensitivity, charm and cool without having to rely on the cheesy script, but the other lead characters are so stock, it's not even funny. His nasty ex-girlfriend is so downright evil, you wonder what kind of morons are at this school that worship her, much less not hate her. Giving these characters a few redeeming qualities would make them more interesting and less like robots. Anna Paquin is underused in a younger sibling role, as is Kieran Culkin.As for unbelievabe scenes, try the group dance thing at the prom - come ON! Is this a musical or are we supposed to believe the entire dance floor learned this choreography in a few minutes? The ending is predictable - if you saw the TV promos, you know how it ends. Even in the final romantic moments, Cook fails to show any warmth or sparkle, but 13-year-old boys are probably too dazed by her swimsuit scene earlier to fault her for that. I'd give this a 5 and recommend waiting until a friend rents it, but some moments are so downright cheesy, it's worth repeated watching for laughs alone.

The most recent Batman movie comes to mind. I've sat through boring movies.  Lost In Space comes to mind.  I've sat through movies with awful dialogue.  You've Got Mail comes to mind.  But there is something about She's All That that elevates the film above mere crap into what Fredrick Nietzsche called the overcrap.  There is no real redeeming value in this film whatsoever.  It's paint-by-numbers all the way.Start with the casting.  Freddie Prinze Jr., while attractive to the ladies, is an awful actor.  He seems to think his job is stand here and look cool right?  Rachel Leigh Cook, on the other hand, is at least solid in the acting skills department.  However, she seems woefully miscast.  She is simply too pretty to really understand what it is to be an outcast.  She probably used some sort of anecdote about not being able to sit at the popular girl's table in the 7th grade to inspire her.  From the moment you see her, you know she can be made into the prom queen, because she isn't weird-looking or fat, nor does she have any characteristic of an outcast aside from the clothes.  Others are brought in and given nothing to do. Matthew Lillard, the actor I consider to be the white Chris Tucker (just wind 'em up and let 'em go, they do the rest) is given a part that does not fit his underappreciated comedic skills.  Usher Raymond and Little Kim are given nothing to do either, as an inordinate amount of screen time is given to the prom-queen in waiting (her name evades me) who simply cannot act her way out of a paper bag.  Alas, poor Kevin Pollack also gives the worst performance of his career.  It's a shame really, the guy is an unappreciated actor and deserves better material than this. The film's script is awful as well.  While the whole cinderella-type idea the film is based on (take the freak and make her prom queen) is enough to support a film, albeit barely, you need real DIALOGUE to make it work! Lines like thank you after having a drink poured down your dress simply won't cut it.  Especially embarrassing is the scene where Kevin Pollack's character watches jeopardy.  Yes, the man is supposed to be rather unintelligent, but the scene is quite simply cringe-inducing.  And why would a 12 year old be skating around a cafeteria putting fresh-ground pepper on Buffy Sommers' plate?  Wouldn't he have school to go to as well?  Never mind the nonsensical final scene.  He couldn't graduate dressed like that period!!Don't waste your time with this.  Go for a walk instead.  Spend time with your family.  Next time you see this in the video store, smash it with your heal and go rent SLC Punk.  You won't regret it.

And sure enough, you regret wasting the time and money afterwards.She's All That starts promisingly enough, with a cool introduction of Uber-school president Prinze and some of the other characters(Matthew Lillard mostly), a neat beach flashback, and a subsequent performance art scene. Then the movie completely gets away.Film critic Roger Ebert applauds the humor around the edges of She's All That. Though there were some funny, random scenes, many of the jokes in this movie went out to die.(I've decided to supersize my falafal balls, says an old man at a Middle Eastern-fastfood restaurant.) Really inexcusable were lines, meant to shed depth on the titular characters, but came out of absolutely nowhere and just confused me. For example, a confrontation between Zack(Prinze) and his father plays out horribly cliched, especially because Zack's complaints don't appear based in reality. Another artist mocks Laney(Cook) for no reason and refers to something that the viewer hasn't even witnessed in the movie. She's All That was set over a six week time span pre-Prom, but surprisingly little takes place, not enough to fill up more than a week by my reckoning.I don't know why this movie has been treated so favorably on IMDB. At this point, She's all that is rated in the mid-6s--above, Top Gun, Spaceballs, White Men Can't Jump, and Risky Business. Heck, the far better Can't Hardly Wait was cut from the same cookie cutter mold and targeted at the same group, and most like this movie more. My only guess is that viewers like the young, talented cast. Cook was beautiful and Prinze and the rest of the cast were cute, though they didn't work great together.

Although the departures from the formula are fresh, the rest of the film, its themes, its resoultion, and its performances are routine.Robert Iscove keeps the pacing and the narrative brisk and breezy as he plods through this by the numbers ugly duckling becomes a swan story. I enjoyed the honesty of the two leads' performances, however routine they were. The situations and the emotions that come forth ring pretty true in real life; i.e. you can come to fall in love with someone you never thought you'd be attracted to, someone who's taken is always for some reason MORE attractive, you never know what's lost until it's gone.Prinze and Cook put all the right moves forward to convey all of that teen angst...Cook in particular shows STRONG promise. O'Keefe plays a great bitch, though one-dimensional, Lillard capitalizes on his screwball sense of humor to elicit yet another entertaining scene-stealing turn, and Walker is a gorgeous piece of eye candy who's suitably jockish and egotistical. Paquin is criminally underused in this film and even when on screen she plays essentially the fairy godmother/overseer role. (She'll make an interesting Rogue for the upcoming X-Men).But the film throws us some wonderful diverting surprises...Prinze's popular jock is actually more sensitive than he puts on (loved the performance art bit); The Real World Lillard character does a hilarious goofball dance sequence that exposes him for the creep he is; and for quite some time the film resists suddenly turning Cook into some airbrushed overdone beauty...she actually transforms for once, plus the jock gets his comeuppance and the relationship between Cook and her father though scant in characterization is refreshing and touching. But cheif among the surprises is a dance sequence that just comes literally out of left field!!! A viewer here bashed it for being too 50's. Well, Iscove is a choreographer (Jesus Christ Superstar...Jewison's movie version), and he stages the prom scene like a grand sequence from one of the great movie musicals. Kudos to Adam Shankman (a great choreographer), the young dancers (several of whom are in current Brittany Spears videos) and Iscove for brilliant staging.

Kevin Pollack and Kieran Culkin are both very cute in their roles as the father and little brother respectively.Overall, this movie is a crummy collage of every high school teen movie cliche you can think of.

But this movie is different. It is aimed at teenagers, but has potential in its acting and plotline to get beyond that. Unfortunately, it rarely takes the route. Rachel Leigh Cook is pretty good as the ugly duckling, but is very one-dimensional in most of her scenes. I am not a fan of Freddie Prinze, Jr. (his father rocked, though!), but his acting chops in this movie weren't all that bad. He shows potential to get beyond a teen idol, but like this movie, I doubt he will follow it. Anna Paquin, one of the best young actresses ever, is underused in this movie and it is in fact a disappointment to see her in this teenie flick. After starring in adult fare like THE PIANO and several other art flicks, she has now started playing type-cast teen roles. Overall, this movie was good, but still doesn't attempt to get beyond anything but a teen flick. Beware of the prom night dance sequence!

Take the main character, played by Rachael Leigh Cook.  When she was initially presented in the movie, I saw no need for her to be transformed at all.  She is a thoughtful, creative person who has found a way to avoid peer pressure and become pleased with herself as a person.  Do we really need to see this tired formula again?  I have seen this type of movie dozens of times before... guy meets girl... girl gets makeover... guy falls for girl.  This movie puts no additional spin on the formula.  A lot of the characters I found very annoying, such as Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Matthew Lillard, those who I'm sure are capable of much better material in the future.

All of the characters are rich (Preston's dad owns a chain of car dealerships and has a house the size of a large hotel).  Laney is supposed to be poor because her father owns a pool cleaning business, but even she has a large house with a pool in her backyard.  All of the kids drive jeeps or convertibles and this is what reminds most viewers of Clueless when they watch this movie.  However, I would definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10.  There was one part of the movie that was bizarre though Laney did not look so bad in the beginning of the movie.  She was beautiful, she just had on glasses and an ugly wig.  Obviously, when they worked on her a bit, she would look fantastic.  But, are we supposed to believe that Zac's little sister Mac gave Laney her big makeover? I mean, half of the girl's hair was cut off and shaped into a new 'do.  Could a 16 year old really accomplish all of that?  If Mac was so talented in makeup and hair, why did she always look so bummy herself?  I was just wondering.  I did like Mac's role though.  Simon (Laney's brother) was one of the few loveable siblings that you see in the movies, and of course, I LOVED Matthew Lillard as Brock.  He was hilarious with his Rick James impersonation. And the cameos by Li'l Kim and Sarah Michelle Gellar from Buffy the Vampire Slayer were great (you have to look hard to find her- she doesn't even speak).

This movie is mediocre -- a bit of feel-good syrupy fluff for those days when you just don't feel like thinking. I found myself wandering at some points, particularly the scene where Laney runs out of the party and Zack comes out there to say some wise words. And the prom dancing scene?! Did I just miss out because the entire senior class didn't do a routine at my prom? Is this something that's always went on and I just never knew? I'll admit it, I fast-forwarded through that part. And I like Matthew Lillard and everything, but isn't he getting a little old to play a guy who chases high school girls around? I mean, he is 29.

I finally rented the movie last night and afterwards regretted my decision. I do have to admit that I am a few years removed from my high school years but I'm not that far removed that I couldn't relate.The movie follows a very predictable teen romance formula and the ending is predictable within the first 5 minutes. Despite that, I continued to watch. The plot revolves around your typical 'in crowd' jock (Prinze) taking on a bet to convert your 'ugly duckling'(Cook) type character into the school queen. There's little sense in giving any more of a summary than that. There are some slight variations but nothing that I would consider really original. The story drags in quite a few parts where you tend to lose interest and in some cases, you could probably walk away from the movie for 20 minutes and come back and not miss a thing.The best performance was given by Cook (Laney) but despite her performance, I found the character completely unbelievable. Cook is a very pretty girl and putting a pair of big glasses and a long haired wig (which was very obvious) on her cannot hide that fact. Maybe some additional makeup (or even lack of it) hiding her looks would have added to her character's look but with the way she was presented, it was incredibly obvious that she was going to look beautiful once a few changes were made.Freddie Prinze doesn't give all that stirring a performance. I've seen him now in two movies (this one and Wing Commander) and his performances were almost identical, which is to say, he doesn't have a very large range. His looks and his smile are getting him by right now but those attributes will only take him so far. Mathew Lillard has played identical type characters in both this movie and Wing Commander and I found him completely annoying in both. There are a few laughs here and there but nothing that would be all that memorable. If any of you do want to see this movie, my suggestion would be to rent it. That way you have to option of turning it off and doing something else.

It is really great to know that the actor in the film is having a good time filming, and you can see the look of joy in his eyes as he speaks...I really think he will be a huge star someday!!!! And now things that were bothersome about the film  First of all, Rachel Leigh Cook was nowhere near dorky enough to be such an outcast, and then after he dresses her up and all, she really isn't All That!!!  Her brother, played by Kiernan Culkin delivered some pretty funny dialogue at times, and he is obviously the better actor!!  Matthew Lillard's part wasn't huge, but he was onscreen long enough to be annoying, so discount his role right there!!  Kevin Pollack did a great job also, as I was in stitches throughout every scene he was in.

Give me a break, the best looking car at my high school is a 99 Mustang.  Another thing that throws me off is the fact that Rachael Leigh Cook's character's dad is a toilet cleaner, but they they still manage to own a new good looking house.  The high school looks like one big mega-complex.  Why don't they just throw a few petite clothing stores and a Texas Roadhouse in or something.  One other thing that boggles my mind is the giant dance sequence at the big formal.  Hello, It is 1999, not 1955. It gave me flashbacks of Grease, very bad!

As teen romantic comedies go, there's other flicks that have been better - Clueless will, doubtless, go down in history as probably the best (so far) in it's genre. I'd say it was more a very well written story. Parts of the film made me sit on the edge of my seat thinking Why on earth did you say that?!? - most of the cases were of Freddie Prinze Jr's character Zach being a total fool and not saying or doing things that he probably should have. The audience groaned a couple of times when such events ocurred. The comedy aspect of the film was great, and to actually hear a bunch of very funny jokes being made from the 'jocks' was quite funny - since most other american teen flicks make them out to be fools with no brains whatsoever. Overall, She's All That was nothing special. It was funny in parts, groansome in others, and sweet for much of the remainder. But definately one I'd see again.

I mean, I've seen many better movies with sort of the same plot but this wasn't all that bad.It had many flaws though. The biggest flaw has to be the pubic hair scene which just doesn't fit in this kind of movie. And what I don't understand is why this Zach Siler guy is so popular that the two guys in the cafeteria didn't just beat the hell out of him. It couldn't be his soccer because that didn't look like anything. Another big flaw is the 'Superman-disease' Laney Boggs seems to have; with glasses on nobody notices her, but when she take them off LOOK OUT WORLD!!!The good thing about the movie is that when you watch it you don't care about these flaws. The soundtrack makes it great too. I love the Sixpence None the Richer song. The acting isn't bad either.

As mindless entertainment, this just about passes, but to be honest, it doesn't have much else going for it.  One perhaps should not expect too much of this type of film, but at a time when teen culture in the USA is very much under the microscope, this says very little about life as a teenager at the end of the century, refusing to challenge the audience and pandering to every cliched assumption in the book.  Is it really true that everyone deep down wants to be prom queen popular, for instance, or that a geeky but beautiful art student who grew up without a mother really just needs another female's attention to show her how to wear make-up or pluck her eyebrows?..... (like wearing make-up and plucking eyebrows are incontrovertibly good things).The plot is so familiar as to be barely worthy of a mention, while the 2-dimensional supporting characters might also ring a few bells (nasty best friend, bitchy ex-girlfriend prom-queen, father (i) supportive but clueless - until the final reel, father (ii) overly ambitious for child, dorky (sex-less) friend, little brother in need of our hero's protection..... ). Throw in some clumsy editing, a couple of excruciating scenes - in particular, the dad, you can't live your life through me - son, i never wanted you to think that exchange, and a typically awful and unrealistic soccer scene (from Karate Kid to this, why do they bother?) and we could have witnessed a real disaster.However, Ms Cook makes one of the more attractive teen heroines, in a very Winona-esque way, and continually holds our interest, as does the dialogue, which when it's not being borrowed from a third grade soap opera is snappy and fresh (though never quite up to Clueless standards).  The plot does knowingly sidestep a number of cliches, for which we should be grateful, and the use of dream sequences, seamless flashbacks, and a tv show within the film, all offer variety to keep the viewer interested.Finally, though, I was left with one big regret - he didn't deserve her, and it was a real pity that she (ie, the writers) didn't recognise that fact.PS -  One footnote - did anyone else while watching the scene where the two guys wearing combat gear and Kill Artists t-shirts are humiliated by head jock and class president Zac start to wonder that maybe it's events like this that lead to such people turning up at school the next day with guns and hand grenades.....?

After all Audrey Hepburn played Eliza Doolittle in an earlier version.In She's All That the ugly one is played by Rachael Leigh Cook who we can see immediately will scrub up very well indeed. She wears frumpy clothes and God Forbid is an artist. So she must be a definite loser.Yet again all of those girls out there who aren't size 10 (or at high school, size 8) and who enjoy reading or the arts are losers. It's tough out there boys and girls, and films like She's All That don't help too much.The lead male is played by Freddie Prinze Jr, and he's engaging enough as an actor but most notably, for me anyway, the frump's Dad is played by Kevin Pollack (A Few Good Men) who true to form steals every scene he's in. And he's a loser too, apparently, because he's only a swimming pool cleaner. We shouldn't treat each other this way.Watch for Anna Paquin (The Piano) in a cameo as the make up expert.

It was not disappointing at all. I thought it's another pre-college perceived woes and teen angst movie -- it's all that the boy-girl attractions, adolescent relationships, the rich-poor juxtaposed situations, and prom night scenario. It's really kinda Some Kind of Wonderful. Rather enjoyable, actually -- even has a bit of My Bodyguard flavor.It holds its own largely attributed to the two main leads Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook as Zach and Laney -- they do seem quite a pair together. There's also the supporting cast including Anna Paquin as Zach's sister, and Kieran Culkin as Laney's little brother, Elden Ratliff as Laney's nerdy good friend, not forgetting a very subdued performance of Laney's father from Kevin Pollak. Of course there's the two camps of followers and the soundtrack music, yet the story's told in a pretty good pace, event after event with timely interludes. Kudos to director Robert Iscove and writer R. Lee Fleming Jr. All in all a wholesome teenage tale with no violence nor sex. A family movie from Miramax.Another family movie from Miramax definitely worth seeing is The Mighty (1998, directed by Peter Chelsom), with Kieran and Elden paired together and both delivered their substantial roles brilliantly well! It's fascinating drama and superb fable-like storytelling of an unlikely indelible friendship -- there's Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton and Gillian Anderson as the supporting adult cast. I felt that this film's content is much more substantial in value than Simon Birch (1998, directed by Mark Steven Johnson), which was a good movie with solid performances from the cast all round, but the storyline is more Hollywood flavor.Pretty In Pink (1986, Molly Ringwald) and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987, Mary Stuart Masterson), both directed by Howard Deutch and written by John Hughes.

To do this I just took myself to a matinee. When I did see it, I made a mistake which I have not made since.  I came to see this movie with very high hopes and expectations but when I left the theater that day, I was very disappointed.  For the next week, I was in a strange but true state of shock.  As a result of this, I almost did not see Blast From the Past just a week later.  I did like the movie but not in the way that it thought I would. The movie was so predictable that almost made me fall asleep just 30 minutes into it.  I didn't because I did not want to pay $4.50 to sleep when I can do that at home for free. The two things that I like about the movie was Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook.  They seemed to make a great team and what appeared to also have chemistry.  I agree to another comment that Rachael is a very pretty nerd.  As a result of this  movie, I am trying to see other movies and gigs with them in it according to the IMDb.

I heard a rumor that the director only shot the first few scenes of the movie on a digital camera, and the movie was so predictable that the computer they uploaded the film onto just completed the rest of it automatically.The acting in this movie was another problem. Usually when people make a movie, they write a plot and find good actors to play the roles. However, in this movie, they decided to find the worst actors they could, then write a movie script that the actors would not be able to play. Hollywood does a lot of interesting experiments like these, but this one failed.Another problem with this movie was the fact that the characters do not follow real life. For example, instead of the most popular kid in high school turning the nerd into the most popular girl in school, he'd probably forget his troubles by saturating his bladder with alcoholic beverages. However, if they had done that with the movie, the acting would not have been as bad, since the cool guy in the movie would have been used to that role.Overall, the movie's probably worth the $6.50 they pay you to watch it.

My favorite surprise was the main character, Laney, who does not fall into the usual Molly Ringwald trap (if you're looking for an '80s comparison - Pretty in Pink is probably the closest, character-wise) of girl falling head-over-heels for the jock and basically doing everything within her power to get him.  Instead, it's Mr. Popular chasing the girl, but only until he realizes that this goes much farther than a simple bet, that he actually has feelings for her.  Laney is not the kind of girl that is easily impressed by money or good-looks, she has been an outsider too long.  She is also able to rise above the popular class instead of simply wishing to be part of them.  The make-up of the populars also was nice, to have some of them actually seem human instead of all hairspray and fashion accessories. The one that befriends Laney does an especially good job at bringing depth to a group that is usually left to stereotypes.  (I would also like to add that she does this with few lines.)  However, most of the other characters do fall into some kind of established stereotype, so don't expect anything too drastic.    The thing that I liked the most about this movie was that it did not emphasize Laney's need to change.  Sure, she got a make-over and was brought out of her shell, but she was not really the one that needed changing.  She doesn't have to change for the guy to like her.  She stays true to herself, which is a much-needed aspect in this genre.   "},{"Title":" I didn't think it was all that but it was entertaining and fun. I'm glad I saw it.

She's drawn comparisons to Winona Ryder, Audrey Hepburn, and Natalie Portman, if you ask me, that's good company. Freddie Prinze, Jr does a great job as the Mr. Popularity, but Lainie doesn't fall for him as quickly as most other girls would. Look for an outstanding (although relatively small) role by Anna Paquin, who plays Prinze's younger sister and make-up artist Mackenzie. Paquin, an academy award winner for The Piano, is terrific in an unusual role for her. The star of the show, however, is Rachael Leigh Cook. My favorite scene isn't anything she says, but it's how she looks when she is walking down the hall with her friend Jessie (Elden Henson). I love the way she walks in this movie. I hope that stardom soon follows Cook. In the future, Academy Award nominations are sure to follow (like her comparisons to Hepburn and Ryder).

In the nineties there have been far fewer of these films.  The only one I absolutely loved was Say Anything with John Cusack, but Clueless and Can't Hardly Wait were enjoyable.  This falls into the category of the latter two.  It's got attractive young stars, a good soundtrack, a few good laughs, that kind of thing.  The performances by Rachel Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze were both great, and many of the supporting players were very good as well.  The storyline seemed shallow, but the development of the two characters' relationship was very cute.  A few slightly cheesy messages were sent out to the target audience, although most of the viewers were probably swooning over Prinze rather than receiving it.  It's still a nice story which proved the main character not to be shallow in the end, with, like I said, some good tunes, an easy on the eyes cast and a lot of funny lines.

That´s why I would obviously be an outcast in the American school system.I watched She´s All That on TV as I had nothing else to do. Romantic teen comedy doesn´t promise much, but I kept watching and got to the end. It wasn´t all that bad, but I just can´t understand why in every school comedy there has to be a queen bitch and a king hunk who are most likely a pair and who are adored and praised by everyone. These movies are just full of clichés! But I guess teenage girls like watching this kind of stuff and living in their dream worlds, it´s just that the real world might not be like that at all. I´d love to see a high school comedy which tells about normal people, not just about the ones that look good. No stereotypes, no bitches, simply real-life people!I´d say She´s All That is a light, mediocre and clichéd rom-com for teenage girls. Some characters, especially some of the ladies, are really annoying and I could never ever spend time with that kind of bitches. And I just think it´s stupid that all the people who have glasses belong either to the middle class or the freaks & the geeks. While the good-looking no-brainers might rule in the high school, it´s us, the ones with actual intelligence and talent, who rule in the real life, believe it or not.

The latest one, She's All That, is a tired, uninspired retread of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, one of the most scintillating and witty works in the English language.  She's All That takes the basic premise of the original, but completely drains it of the irony, wit and cleverness that are its hallmarks.  In the original, Eliza Doolittle is a lower class cockney flower girl with real visions of improving her station in life.  In this film,  Eliza is simply a social misfit who has no desire or even need to make it in the stuffy, elitist tier of this high school society.   The audience develops no rooting interest in the outcome because the goal seems so shallow.  In fact, this Eliza is not even aware of the bet her Henry Higgins has made that he will change and conquer her as retaliation for his own girlfriend's dumping him.  Thus, sans aspiration, her character becomes just a victim of callous manipulation - until the hero's predicatble change of heart, of course.  The script falls far short of Shavian wit to say the least, but filmmakers bold enough to risk such comparisons should best beware.  Perhaps the most curious aspect of this film is that it is the first I can remember in which a high school is completely devoid of adults of any kind - there's not a teacher, coach, principal, guidance counselor or even custodian in sight.  Needless to say, no one ever even enters a classroom, let alone cracks open a book.  This is, after all, upper middle class America in the 1990's and students certainly couldn't be bothered with anything as mundane as studying at school.  They do have time, though, to devour a pubic hair covered pizza.  Now there's an extracurricular activity fit for the times!

But it was surprisingly fun to watch. While the story was typical, the two stars, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook made it watchable, and they both have very bright futures ahead of them.She's All That follows the same basic plot line we've all seen millions of times over. Two guys make a bet over a girl. If one guy can transform her into a prom queen, he wins. Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) having just been dumped by his girlfriend for a Real World castaway (a very funny parody featuring Matthew Lillard), accepts the bet as a way of affirming his Big Man on Campus status. The girl in question is Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), the awkward girl who likes to paint. So Zach and Laney start hanging out, having a good time, it looks like Zach will win the bet, but he's really falling for Laney, but then his friend spills the beans to her about the bet, and she gets upset, so Zach has to try and win her back, then everyone's all happy in the end. I think from the time we all saw previews for this, we all knew how it was going to end.The reason this movie was as entertaining as it was, was due to both Prinze Jr. and Cook. They have this likeable quality about them, that makes you want them to be happy together. Of course, in a film like this, all the characters are pretty stereotypical. Zach's ex-girlfriend is the most popular girl in school who treats everyone badly. Zach's best friend (the one who made the bet) is an irritating b**tard who just wants to get down every girls pants. Zach is not only the star of the soccer team, he's also the senior class President, front runner for Prom King, and of course, the most popular boy in school. And Laney is that attractive girl they keep hidden under baggy clothes and glasses so that when she comes out we're all supposed to be surprised at how this ugly duckling turned into a swan. So, as I was saying earlier, the reason this movie was entertaining was because of Prinze Jr. and Cook being able to break out of their stereotypical roles and bring a real life likeable quality to the characters. What kind of guy or girl wouldn't have fallen for these two back in high school?Also, the director pulled off a few tricks I liked. The Real World parody was dead on, with Lillard playing a Puck-like character on the Real World, then using that fame to get girls and other jobs. There were also some cool flashback scenes that were utilized to tell the story. The script itself was run of the mill, and the characters didn't really have anything original to say (although I did enjoy the fact that Laney worked at a falafel stand).The one thing that sort of bothered me about the two main stars was that they looked too far apart in age at time. I figure they're both supposed to be seniors in high school, but he looks 20, and she looks 14. Robbing the cradle came to mind a few times. And oh yeah, there's a scene in here involving a pizza and some pubic hair that was as gross if not grosser than any hair gel scene in There's Something About Mary. It had me rolling in the aisles when I saw it.She's All That was a fun movie to watch. Nothing unexpected happens, and you all know what's going to happen right from the start, but with Prinze Jr. and Cook leading the way, it's still a good movie to see.

She's All That is as over-the-top as it can get and the movie ironically contains random jokes and parodies about supposedly realistic programs as well, namely the MTV-spawned reality show The Real World and its progeny series Road Rules. This movie is all in good fun but it does manage to hint at a good deal of real life trifles that particular people suffer in that highly-influential and barely survivable place that we geeks and outsiders call high school. Well, maybe not high school (probably closer to HELL), but anyone who was picked on or unjustifiably ostracized gets the picture.The endearing Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. star in this sugary ditty about a dude named Zack Silar (Prinze) who is ditched by his long-time armpiece Taylor Vaughn (O'Keefe) only six weeks before the prom. He suffers public humiliation in front of his jock companions and, moreover, the entire school. His less-than-sympathetic pal Dean (Walker) proposes a bet which the illustrious school president can't pass up Dean will hand-pick the geekiest girl in the school and within the time allotted, Zack must transform her into a mega-babe and make her more than eligible for the elite status of prom queen. The deal is on and within only two minutes of searching, the scary and inaccessible Laney Boggs (Cook) makes her appearance by falling flat on her face in the courtyard - Dean has found his guinea pig. From here, Prinze and Cook do the traditional and recycled theme of geek-to-goddess. Suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite for this transformation - the pretty and petite Cook is hardly an ugly duckling by any standard, her luminous brown eyes and almost pixie-ish beauty a complete distraction, even when she is supposed to look mousy (tortoiseshell glasses, stringy hair, sloppy clothes, etc.). Prinze comes off humble and sweet even when he is trying to be suave and arrogant, but this doesn't ruin anything. We rather want to see him that way because we want to believe that he really does care about Laney and that his reputation is the last thing on his mind. Prinze does this remarkably well. Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is a riot as a fictitious Real World cast member Brock Landers, a character that is obviously modeled from the obnoxious and insensitive Puck from Real World San Francisco. Of course, he's a lot more likable because his character is a complete farce and Lillard almost steals the show. Almost unbearable is Paul Walker as Dean Sampson, the narcissistic jock who places the bet with Zack and manipulates it in his favor. Walker's delivery is so forced and obtuse that one would believe that is truly HIS nature and not just his character. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is a comedic queen as the vacuous Taylor Vaughn, and Kieran Culkin and Eldin Ratliff are again part of the same cast list (The Mighty) but this time as Laney's younger brother Simon and her best friend Jesse, respectively. If you watch closely during a particular lunchroom scene, you will see Prinze's wife and Buffy TV star Sarah Michelle Gellar make a brief cameo.

The only thing that makes Cook's character a nerd that must be looked down upon is that she wears glasses. Literally, all that happens is that she gets a hair cut and takes off her glasses, and suddenly she is transformed into a great beauty.The subplot here involves Prinze's character not wanting to accept that he must grow up, face his father and pick a college. The rest is kind of blah, except for Matthew Lillard as the ex-Real Worlder who has taken Prinze's girlfriend. He is a scene stealer. The two leads have a nice chemistry, but this movie is nothing special, and you know how it will end right from the beginning.

The main character of the story is another girl who doesn't stick to the norm and tends to be more of what society would consider as a rebel. Not in the drug using, sexaholic type, but the shy, quiet type. She keeps to herself and is instantly considered to be a loser.However, we can fix that by making her wear makeup, pretty dresses, and completely denying who she truly is. In the end, instead of being unique, she just becomes the same as everyone else. It can safely be assumed that the main character in this movie never receives much attention from men, except from her close friend who is constantly ushering her into the relationship with the guy who made a bet to turn her into prom queen.This movie brings out the lowest of lows in culture today by promoting outer instead of inner beauty.

Laney Boggs Rachel Leigh Cook) is the most attractive one in the movie, excluding Mackenzie Stiler (Anna Paquin, X2). Then the story line could kill you, another bad retread of a good formula. She's All That is about a bet between the recently dumped Zach Stiler (Freddy Prinze Jr.), the king of the school, and his friends. They bet him he can't take a certain girl to prom. Laney Boggs is voted most unlikely to be prom queen by Zach's friends, of whom I forget their names, despite her beauty. The film admits that the problem with Laney is that she is inaccessible and rebellious, not that she is physically deformed.  I'm leaving out a lot, but I have confidence that you could figure out the rest. There's Zach's girlfriend, Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and her new bodyfriend, the disgusting Brock (Matthew Lillard). This movie is horrible. It is slow, boring, and ugly. Taylor went overboard with her metallic makeup, Laney's paintings are not so great, Freddy Prinze Jr. is ugly! If you really want to see this movie, save yourself the pain and rent Not Another Teen Movie.

It's probably older than time. Two excellent (and very different) movies come to mind right away... Brian De-Palma's Carrie and John Hughes' Pretty in pink. I think this movie is almost as good and certainly in the same league. It may be slightly lesser than those two, but not by much.Several ingredients come together to make this movie excellent and put it at the top of the heap among 90's teen comedy's. First of all there's the chemistry between the two leads. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook mesh perfectly as a couple. As you watch the film you want them to get together and you want things to work out between them. Secondly, Cook's performance and screen presence are exceptional. She is very believable and her character grounds the film, saving it from it's sillier moments.The final ingredient is the director... Robert Iscove seems to have superior talent. He's not flashy and in many ways his style is invisible but if you really watch the movie, nearly every scene is brilliantly executed, especially the quieter moments and the most important scenes where the story shifts.

Anyone who knows me knows that the only reason I rented this DVD was because of a certain name appearing in the credited cast. That, in a nutshell, is the problem with She's All That. Instead of trying to build a credible drama or comedy with three-dimensional characters, it dissolves rapidly into a farcical study in how much happier we would all be if we thought alike, looked alike, and acted alike. Were it not for the ever-wonderful Anna Paquin making use of a role that benefits no end from her easygoing, honest acting style, I would swear that writer R. Lee Fleming Jr. is a pseudonym for the revolting Ronald Bass. Take a character each from glorified soapies like Charmed or Beverly Hills 987whatever, dump them onto celluloid, mix them in a bowl, and throw them at the screen. The resultant image will not look much different to what you see here. And that's a terrible shame, because in spite of appearing in some terrible pieces, Rachael Leigh Cook has proved she is capable of far better.Then again, I should have been able to predict disaster was in the air when I saw that the cast list featured both Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard, known after Wing Commander by casting agents as the gruesome twosome. Even the central premise is lifted wholesale from teenie flicks that did it far better. In a nutshell, Freddie bets his obnoxious friends after being dumped by the sort of woman I would describe as no big loss that he can take the sort of woman he and his fellow airheads consider less than attractive, then make her over to be the conception these morons have of attractive. It is like trying to put the body of a Lamborghini over the engine of a 1920s Model T or the like. You can polish that bodywork until the beholder sees his own reflection in it, but at the end of the day, the thing will still move like a Model T. And with the exception of Anna Paquin, the entire cast that the bodywork is going over here is incredibly ugly. Writers who fail to realise that humanity's virtues come from its members' differences are already a dime a dozen.But to be fair to the film, Ebert has a good point when he says that it is the details that rescue the film from being entirely a write-off. To use Ebert's words, I was grateful that at least someone could take this weary material and do something with it. Minor details peppered over the main story, such as Kevin Pollak's enthusiasm for Jeopardy, give She's All That a laugh quotient in spite of a central premise that would otherwise become offensive. Indeed, it is somewhat indicative of the cast's quality when one struggles to remember what the first-billed stars of the film have to say for themselves, but any memories one has of said film are all tied to the supports. Freddie Prinze Jr. has gone three fifths of nowhere since She's All That, and no wonder given that he comes off here as something of a fourth-rate Keanu Reeves. I used to joke a lot about Keanu's woodenness, but after River's Edge, I am starting to compare his performance there to Freddie's in She's All That and wonder if maybe we are being just a little unfair to Reeves. At least his blank expression became useful towards the end of My Own Private Idaho.Once upon a time, I told a fellow aspiring writer that the best way to build a character is by reinforcing the audience's impression of them with their actions. Going to the exact opposite end of the cinematic scale and using C'era Una Volta Il West as an example, Sergio Leone made Frank an unforgettable character by showing him shooting a child dead after one of his men calls him by name. And that is one major problem in films like She's All That. The characters are all speech. We are told that character X is this or that by character Y, and the writer expects us to take character Y at their word. With no act on which to balance the verbal descriptions of the character, we are left with little more than a bunch of talking heads. Or a ninety-minute episode of Beverly Hills 12345, if you will. The characters in this mess that do feel like more than a cardboard cut-out are exactly those that should not in comparison to the stars. I know I have said that several times now, but one cannot emphasise that part enough.I gave She's All That a four out of ten. Two of those stars are for Kevin Pollak and Anna Paquin. Between them, they firmly act everyone else in the film under the table. If you are a fan of either of those two, and a rabid completist, then She's All That is worth a look. Otherwise, don't bother.

They somehow circle back and their badness garners the film a cult following. Think Showgirls. However, She's all That is the worst kind of bad film in that it's bad in an utterly forgettable way. The plot is hackneyed and trite, the acting is mediocre and much of the dialogue exists simply for the purpose of pushing plot.Here's what I think happened. A producer proposed a concept for a movie to a writer who was only doing this to further their career until they could write the movie they really wanted to (I'm hoping.) You have Zack, the Adonis-like jock, played with haunting banality by Freddie Prinze Jr, who is dumped by Taylor, his sexpot girlfriend (Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, one of the better performances in the film.) He then bets his friends that he can turn Lany, the school's dorkiest girl, played by Rachel Leigh Cook who does the best she can, into the prom queen. This film writes itself, right? Wrong! You still need a well-envisioned script to bring a movie to life. This writer clearly slapped this movie together the weekend before he met with the producers.To say this movie isn't thought-provoking or that it doesn't raise questions is a lie. I have several questions. One why does Zach's sister Mackenzie (played by academy award winner Anna Paquin) who's one of the few interesting characters in the film get such little screen time? Same for Elden Henson and Kieran Culkin. Two Why does Rachel Leigh Cook catch a basketball that Freddie Prinze Jr. holds next to his naked crotch with such a smile? I'm sure there would be some kind of black market value on an item that touched Freddie Prinze Jr's junk, but am I the only one who finds that a bit nasty? And three if Zach is as smart as the film says he is, wouldn't he surely be able to see how incredibly beautiful Lany was underneath her glasses and her freaky clothes? They do such a terrible job of making the lovely Rachel Leigh Cook look ugly. In fact, when Zach and his buddies are picking the girl for the prom queen experiment, they gaze upon several different possibilities (all uglier than Cook) until they settle for the stereotypical nerd which is really just a supermodel in floods and glasses. I just keep thinking how much more interesting the film would have been if they would have picked an actress who didn't fit the mold of what is traditionally considered beautiful or smoking hot. Perhaps Maggie Gyllenhaal (that's just a suggestion and not one I necessarily recommend for any number of reasons. One I happen to think she's gorgeous. And two she wouldn't touch a film as dumb and meandering as this with a fifty-foot pole.)

"},{"Title":"Why I can't stand this movie","Date":"7 January 2006","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" This movie was one of the glut of teen comedies that came out in the late '90s/early '00s, spurred on by the success of American Pie and its ilk. Generally, these movies weren't any good. It made me sad to be a high schooler during that period of time. Why couldn't I have grown up with Say Anything... ten years earlier, or Grease twenty years earlier? Not that they were great works of film-making, but at least they were enjoyable. But I digress. Although I'm not a huge fan of the genre in general, I reserve a special disdain for She's All That for the following reasons 1. It's a bad rip-off of the Pygmalion story. Now, while it's fine to do updates on classic literature, and indeed, the Pygmalion story would be a good one to update, it's not fine to dumb it down. This felt like the reaching for the lowest common denominator version of My Fair Lady, except with a much worse soundtrack. The humor level went from C'mon Dover, move yer bloomin' arse! to What did he just put on that pizza?? 2. It's a celebration of conformity. It's not so much the physical makeover that gets to me (even though I talk about that a bit more below); it's the accompanying change of personality. When Laney becomes her cooler self (gag, gag, gag!!), she loses pretty much all of the quirky qualities of her personality that made her interesting in the beginning of the movie. She pretty much became just like everyone else, which was saddening. At least in the original Pygmalion story, Eliza became a stronger person after her transformation; Laney just becomes a gooey-eyed bimbo.3. Speaking of eyes, this movie perpetuates a bias against people who wear glasses, saying that they're automatically nerdy and unattractive and must get contacts STAT! if they want any hope of being cool and good-looking. (Sorry, just a personal pet peeve of mine; it just gets on my nerves, especially because I know people who think this way in real life.) 4. C'mon, this transformation was too easy. As a lot of other reviewers have pointed out, Laney was already pretty. All they did was slap on some quirky clothing and glasses (see point #3), and she was automatically in need of a makeover to make her hot. Right. You know, sometimes the people that really stand out are the ones considered the most beautiful. But that seems to be lost on anyone here, who think that you have to look just like everyone else to be attractive. They could have picked a better project or case to make over.Anyway, these are my thoughts. I'm not even going to touch on the awful acting and the fact that high school was never remotely like it was portrayed in this movie (a high school radio station??). I just have problems with this movie at the foundational level.As a final thought, may I just submit for your consideration that the title is a phrase so dated that, a mere 7 years later, no one really uses it anymore? Clearly, there was something very short-sighted in the making of this movie.

This is apparently wrong. What is right is that you're pretty and you have fun and you don't care about anything important.

Entirely the wrong way around!On the plus side, Matthew Lillard's character is a lot of fun, if only because he is paired with the extremely hateable Taylor.
