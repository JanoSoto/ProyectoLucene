The clothes, the hair, makeup, music, attitude, interiors and locations ride the crest of the high-style wave that flooded the world through the Eighties. Combining the improbable worlds of violence and fashion, with a story that centers on a famous photographer (Dunaway) and her ability to *see* her friends and colleagues being stalked and murdered, *Eyes* has moments of serious suspense, but that's hardly the reason to see this movie. Utilizing the actual photography of fashion god Helmut Newton, the film maker has exquisitely captured the 1978 New York fashion and disco scene in a way that none of the recent looks at the Seventies has been able to, but then, again, this movie was *made* in 1978, not 27 years later. The scenes of photo shoots are particularly fun to watch, with one scene portraying a burning car crash in Columbus Circle in which the models, clad in garter belts and fur coats cat-fight before the camera. The ingenuous use of *real* models add the precise amount of vacuity necessary to make the surreal shot work. Another photo shoot involves a model dead from a gunshot to his heart lying in a pool surrounded by exotically dressed disco-dancing models and a throbbing disco beat. The plot is secondary to style in this movie, and style is the only reason this movie should be remembered. Favorite moment Darlanne Fluegel as the model Lulu haplessly trying to explain to the press *why* violence is important in fashion photos.

I recall it as not having the best of reputations. But I found it to be suspenseful and it could be considered a forerunner of today's erotic thrillers.Faye Dunaway is Laura Mars, a fashion/glamour photographer whose work is controversial in that some say it glorifies both sex and violence towards women. (Sounds like a pretty contemporary theme, doesn't it?) She becomes troubled by frightening visions she has of killers-eye views of murders. When a killing she has just seen turns out to have actually happened nearby she tells the police. She then finds out that a detective (Tommy Lee Jones) has already been investigating some cases where murder scenes closely resembled her photos.Dunaway is always consistent in delivering good performances and this one is no exception. It was refreshing not to see Jones in his Mr. Intensity character he's played so often since 'The Fugitive.' Although some will doubtless find flaws to point up here and there, I found the film to be very enjoyable. Brad Dourif, Rene Aberjonois and Raul Julia also star.

But what will she do when she sees said murderer coming after her?Eyes of Laura Mars was originally based upon a screenplay by master horror director John Carpenter, which isn't surprising considering just how imaginative and effectively frightening that this film comes off. Yet, Eyes' isn't just a terror film, it's also a film of intriguing mystery, sweeping romance, and well-rounded characters. All of this adds up to an enveloping story that's directed with flair and style by Irvin Kershner. The murder sequences pack plenty of tension, yet they aren't gory. The NYC filming locations are fantastic and allow for some truly breath taking cinematography. While the 70's fashions do date the film, they don't subtract from its over all impact. The soundtrack is composed of some great disco numbers, and the theme song by Barbara Streisand is stunningly good.The cast is perhaps the best highlight of the film though. Star Faye Dunaway is excellent as always as our understandably disturbed heroine. Tommy Lee Jones is equally excellent as the police detective who falls in love with Dunaway. Rene Auberjonois is plucky as Dunaway's agent. Brad Dourif is good as the shifty-eyed driver, as is Raul Julia as Dunaway's wretched ex-husband.Eyes of Laura Mars is on a level above the average terror film.

The pair of them must figure it out quickly because the murderer is closing in on Laura and those close to her.In 1978, John Carpenter thrilled horror fans with his baby sitting terror piece, Halloween. Also released was this mystery/thriller/horror film, written by Carpenter and directed by Irvin Kershner The Empire Strikes Back which is a film that has been called anything from innovative to outright rubbish. The truth is that where Halloween is a horror film of no character substance, Eyes Of Laura Mars is a completely different animal. It's bright blending of 70s fashion photography with Carpenter's dastardly tale tho the final draft was tampered by many, is a success. This is a psychological thriller first and foremost, yes horror elements are there it's a done deal with a serial killer on the loose, but running alongside a clever romantic angle, the film gains an intensity that few other 70s psychological thrillers can boast.The cast, other than an insipidly hammy Raul Julia, also come out rather well. Faye Dunaway Mars, Tommy Lee Jones Neville, Brad Dourif horror staple that he is and Rene Auberjonois give credit to well formed characters. Technically it's a fine picture as well, Irvin Kershner and his cinematographer Victor J. Kemper excellently utilise the New York City location. Especially during the fashion shoot sequences, where the 70s and its glamour is fully realised. Innovated blurred corridor shots to portray Laura's terrible visions are creepy and highly effective, while i would be surprised if anyone doubted the impact of a mirror shot in the glorious finale.Thought by many to have not aged well, Eyes Of Laura Mars is often consigned to the cupboard marked dated, that's unfair because good thrillers are good thrillers, regardless of age.

I remembered it as being fantastic but upon watching it again I was a little disappointed. It's a solid film, by no means bad, it's just nothing all that special.For the past 3 years or so I've been totally hooked on giallo's and this film plays in a lot of ways like an homage to those Italian thrillers. Touches here and there remind you of Dario Argento (obsessive mirror imagery, Laura's visions etc.), Lucio Fulci, Sergio Martino and Mario Bava, such as the model settings and murder scenarios. While this film scores heavy on style (and music, though I find this soundtrack a bit hokey, but generally OK) it just lacks the magic that the best giallo's seem to have. The plot, while intriguing enough, is not nearly played out to it's full potential. There are gripping scenes here to be sure, but the film drags quite a bit and nothing virtually happens for a long period of time.For seasoned giallo fans, we know the killer is most definitely gonna be the most unlikely one, and for a lack of suspects, I didn't find it hard to figure out who was guilty, but there's pretty much no logic to support it (but that's a giallo trademark, a pro rather than a con actually). For me, the problem is that this film doesn't have the same trashy feel and atmosphere as the best Italian thrillers it seems to be imitating. In a lot of ways I like this film, certain scenes are truly gripping but there's simply something lacking. Being a huge fan of John Carpenter, I can't help but think what he could have done had he directed this. He came up with the story and shares the credits as the writer of the screenplay and what's more, he loves the Italian giallo films as well. His own homage to the genre; Someone's Watching Me, the little known TV film was terrific and you could see that he definitely had the feel for the genre and could easily translate it to American settings. I don't feel that Kershner, as good a director as he is, has the same love for the genre as Carpenter.I recommend watching it, it scores on a number of levels.

Her character is supposed to be a strong, successful, visionary/controversial photographer. She seemed to start many scenes playing just that, but would then quickly fall to pieces and appear to not know where she was, what she was doing, or how to answer a simple question. This happens over and over. I felt like I was watching over- acting from the 40s.The rest of the cast saved it for me. Especially Brad Dourif and Tommy Lee Jones.I liked the general story and premise, but even at only 104 minutes, it felt drawn-out. A lot of people seem to think the ending was predictable.

Faye does an outstanding job as the Mahogany of photography who can see murders in her mind's eye as they happen, but is helpless to stop them. She plays a totally sympathetic character practically unlike any role she played during this era (Voyage of the Damned being possibly the only other role), extremely as far away from her neurotic character in Chinatown and the power-hungry executive in Network. She is as far from her infamous role of Mommie Dearest as she can get, although she reminds me a lot of Miss Joan Crawford in a 1952 thriller called Sudden Fear.Top billed leading male Tommy Lee Jones plays a cop who decides to protect her and eventually falls in love with her. The supporting cast is filled with interesting performances, particularly Rene Auberjonois as a stereotypical gay assistant, obviously modeled on Clifton Webb in Laura. Raul Julia and Brad Dourif add some creepy performances as well. Stage and soap actress Meg Mundy has a nice brief role as one of the victims. Views of New York City in the late '70s are quite well filmed, and you won't soon forget the shot of Columbus Circle with two women clad only in their scanties and mink coats going at it after a faked car accident while Dunaway snaps away. Add on a spicy Barbra Streisand song (Prisoner) as well as some disco hits of the day. But a lack of cohesion and the final revelation both dates and destroys the credibility that earlier parts of the film had developed earlier. Try not to compare this to some of Hitchcock's later films and sexual thrillers of the 1980's and 90's like Fatal Attraction, Sea of Love, and especially Basic Instinct.

Can she convince a sceptical police force of this psychic link, and how long before the killer comes calling for her ?I have a bit of a problem with movies which date badly. I don't mind if a filmmaker is trying to reflect the times (Sullivan's Travels, Easy Rider), or developing a specific visual style (The Maltese Falcon, Blade Runner), but when a movie is just full of stupid clothes, silly hairstyles and bad music, it often grates hard enough to spoil any suspense and kill the dramatic tension. This is a such a movie. The premise, from a script by a young John Carpenter, is interesting enough; as Laura starts to understand what's happening to her she tries to make some impact (albeit unsuccessfully) on events, and the fact that she's effectively rendered blind when the visions come is a nifty way of putting her in peril. It doesn't matter though, because her character is so aloof and such a scaredy-cat that it's hard to have much sympathy for her. When the maniac is finally at her door, the best she can do is scream, Go away ! - come on honey, get a grip. Also, the plotting is weak; we know chief suspect Dourif is too obvious a patsy and the denouement with Jones abruptly turning into some schizo lunatic with a deathwish is a classic case of the old hack's let's introduce a totally new element in the last ten pages maxim. Having said that though, he is one of relatively few Hollywood heartthrobs with enough range to convince as both open-minded cop and murderous creep, and he, Dourif and Fluegel are all very good, as is Michael Kahn's razor-slice editing. Featuring some really diabolical disco hits, and an atrocious theme song by Barbara Streisand, who was originally slated to play the lead. In the vein of other seventies big-studio slashers (Klute, Looking For Mr Goodbar) this is an interesting thriller, but not nearly as much fun as Dario Argento's equally harebrained but much more stylish slasher flicks of the period.

What always pains me about thrillers like this is they assume we are happy to watch and have things unfold for us, without our involvement. Not that we aren't shocked by blood and death, but we are not given clues or hints, even false hints, to make us start to figure out what is going on and who did what. Instead, we just watch another and another of these quirky awful murders. And watching isn't enough. This isn't a terrible movie, but it has the aura of something more original and special. Expect a common murder spree with a romance thrown in and you'll enjoy it.There might be a hidden (and unintended) metaphor in the film about us as consumers watching the unapproachable supermodels who are the underlying landscape of the film. Echoes of Jack the Ripper are faint and cheap. And women, over and over again (as with lots of 1970s movies) are just eye candy, both as actresses and as models for the photography. Throw in glamorized murder, and you have what could have been a disturbing and brilliant film. But far from it.Beauty is what it is, but Faye Dunaway struts as if she's the creme de la creme, and in fact her stiff haughtiness bleeds into her part. Some depth and surprise in her performance would have helped a lot. It's fun seeing Tommy Lee Jones in a young, hunky role, and he's pretty good, if not loosened up and amazing as he would later be.A lot of this might be traced to the director, who, like it or not, is responsible for pulling it all together and getting the most out of everyone. Irvin Kerschner has a short resume and no particular style. The trick of this film, the photographer's visions, are scary and a little inventive, but their effect is dampened by effects. That is, the visual dimming and blurring is what it is, easily digested, and the events don't add up to anything more than just a quick murder each time. No fun at all, and slightly sad.The photography itself? It looks like slick Helmut Newton (Newton was slick of course, but with a wiry edge to his setups) and it makes me think of Ellen Von Untwerth, who made shocking scenes pretty in the same kind of way. Ah, I read now the photos were by Newton with the help of Rebecca Blake, who I've never heard of. Newton was famous for his misogynist and high brow fashion work, often using nudity beyond the norm for his days (in the 1960s and 70s). Any critique of that kind of abusive photography one might read into the movie is blunted by the fact that the photographer here is a woman.In the end, the movie survives on style, and it does have a really nice feel to it, not in how it was filmed, but in the subject matter.

At some point you just want someone to slug her.The supporting cast is headed by Tommy Lee Jones as the lead detective on the murder cases. Jones is passable but his character is dumb. He makes decisions that a good detective wouldn't make. Brad Dourif began his string of eccentric characters as one of Laura's assistants. Gee do you think he will be a suspect in the murders? As far as the mystery goes there really isn't much of one. If you pay any attention to the film the identity of the killer is easy to figure out within the first 30 minutes of the movie.

After her friends and some of her models are killed, she joins forces with the future U.S. Marshal to identify the killer before she is next.......It's a silly movie for sure, the majority of the film from a characters point of view is seeing Dunaway/Mars taking lots of photos of scantily clad ladies before standing there silently for a few minutes and then running off without explanation. Ironically, if we saw the film form someone else's point of view, it would have made for a more tense thriller.But this is high concept for you, and knowing that De Palma was doing good things homaging Hitchcock, Kershner must have wanted a taste before hitting the heady heights of Star Wars, Bond, Robotic Police, and..................Seaquest DSV.And for the most part, it's pretty entertaining, having the plethora of red herrings thrown at the screen is always a camp treat, but I'm sure it would have been more fun back on its initial release, as I'm sure Dourif wouldn't have been a suspect as soon as we saw him, because Child's Play was ten years away.Sub characters are the archetypes you would expect when the film focuses on the upper class, all la dee dar, and abhorrent toward one another, Laura aside, you couldn't really care less who out of her group is next.Jones is good, he's just a younger Gerrard in this, and he steals the film from anyone, thanks to his intense performance.If your a fan of this type of sub genre, you can see the ending coming quite soon into the films second act, but the outcome is quite entertaining.And it has a soundtrack that could rival Saturday Night Fever.Not brilliant by any means, but it's a lot of fun.

The motivations of a serial killer whose victims are all associated with one of the city's top fashion photographers, are a complete mystery and the plot which produces plenty of surprises, suspects and suspense (as well as some supernatural elements), builds up to a conclusion that's suitably twisted.Laura Mars (Faye Dunaway) is the trendy photographer whose images regularly juxtapose sexual and violent content in a way that's edgy, provocative and attention-grabbing. Her innovative work has made her both highly successful and controversial but when she starts to experience psychic visions of murders which she can see through the eyes of the killer, she understandably becomes very distressed. When it also becomes apparent that the victims are all associated with Laura and the detective who's assigned to the case notices strong similarities between her photographs and the scenes of some unsolved murders, he naturally starts to suspect that she may be criminally involved. Laura's anxiety then increases when she starts to sense that someone is stalking her and thinks that she may be the killer's real target.Detective Lieutenant John Neville (Tommy Lee Jones) has an easy-going manner and tries to establish who the killer may be by speculating on the types of people who may have been offended by Laura's work.

Following a chase which culminates in the police shooting dead one of Laura's colleagues, it appears that the culprit has finally been caught but soon after, it becomes clear that this isn't the case when Laura finds herself confronted by the real killer in circumstances that leave her shocked and traumatised.Faye Dunaway does a great job of portraying Laura's fear, desperation and sophistication and Tommy Lee Jones is absolutely superb in his role. Rene Auberjonois as Laura's agent, Brad Dourif, as her chauffeur and Raul Julia as her husband are also all excellent in their important supporting roles.With its strong focus on fashion and a soundtrack which features lots of disco music, this is very much a movie of its time. The violence is often horrific with the murder victims being stabbed in the eyes by an ice-pick and the photo-shoots are deliberately exploitative, decadent and misogynistic.

Bright and dashing, glittering all around, these visuals strongly remind us of what the 1970-s really were about sexual freedom unhampered by AIDS (which emerged as late as the 1980-s).However, I spot a significant difference with 'Blow Up'. Antonioni has his 1960-s visuals brilliantly supported by a half hidden and intriguing story. Unfortunately 'The eyes of Laura Mars' lacks such a refined extra value. Although not bad, this film's story reminds us of a mediocre police series on your television. It may even degrade its visual brilliance.Apart from its new & newly tolerated sexual freedom, there is not much left to tell about the 1970-s. So maybe Laura Mars' quality-gap between visuals and story may function to symbolize this remarkable era after all.

In the movie, these visions can strike Laura Mars at the moment they happen regardless of what she happens to be doing. Moreover, the victims are all members of her modeling staff. It's a wonder then that she's not a nervous wreck, an understandable consequence the film too typically ignores.This psychic element makes a heckuva of a movie premise, but its effectiveness also depends on how the story around it is developed. And here I can only say the narrative results are little short of a mess. It's like the five or six screenwriters simply failed to communicate with one another, resulting in a near incoherent narrative&#x97; for example, what is the killer's motivation, what is causing Laura's psychic visions, what relevance does Raul Julia's dangling presence have to the plot, etc. None of these are answered, or unless I missed something, even hinted at. Instead the narrative stumbles along in fits and jerks without much relation to what's gone before. Then there's the totally unbelievable ending that by itself is enough to sink the film.No need to go on since other negative aspects are discussed effectively by other reviewers. Instead, let me suggest a direction in which the story could have gone. For example, establish early on some psychic connection between Laura and Neville before they ever meet. Perhaps, she sees his compelling gaze in a photograph and is strangely transfixed by it. Thus a connection is established. This opens also the possibility that the murders are fated to happen, and both characters act not as independent agents, but are in fate's malevolent grip. In such a manner, the psychic world would be expanded and not drowned in a clutter of confusion.Anyway, the premise certainly deserves better treatment than it got from a glut of writers. Too bad.

And today, it hits me exactly the same way.Yes, it's got a crass, urban-sleaze vibe a la the late-'70s, which is both its weakness and its strength.Even though I'm very fond of the 1970s (and it got a bad rap during the endless revisionism of the '80s) there was a definitively sleazy, gutter undertone to the latter half of the decade which worked its way into even mainstream movies. (CRUISING and DRESSED TO KILL and CALIGULA and LOOKING FOR MR GOODBAR all seem prime examples which, while not graphic by today's standards maybe, nonetheless tapped into the sordid, carnally apocalyptic tone of the day). Likewise, the period seemed the apex of real life serial killer zeitgeist somehow.And the period plays a key role in why they don't entirely work -- and yet why they DO work.The '70s had a melancholy, breezy, sexy thing going on which defined the decade, yet the last half of that decade also had an odd gutter-smarm undercurrent which is hard to describe but at the time was hard to miss... It wasn't the only era to give us real life serial sex murderers, but -- gee! -- no other era seemed to fit it so well.Movies tapped into this vibe as well. And if it was going to do so effectively, you had to wind up getting a bit queasy during or after watching it. And that was these films' strengths as well as their vulnerability to partly-valid criticism.Curiously, motion pictures can get much more explicit today, but few of them feel so utterly fetishistic as those from the late-'70s. These pictures were repellent in many ways, largely on purpose. But their sordid-beyond-belief flavor was absolutely part of the zeitgeist of the time. And I retained an interest in them without fully condoning them.They're period pieces, essentially. And valuable for that reason.And they sort of define that old, over-used idea that it's so bad it's good. Ultimately, despite the elements that don't entirely work, the overall film just does.Film critic Janet Maslin said about it at the time, ...It's the cleverness of EYES that counts, cleverness that manifests itself in superlative casting, dryly controlled direction from Irvin Kershner, and spectacular settings that turn New York into the kind of eerie, lavish dreamland that could exist only in the idle noodlings of the very, very hip... And George Lucas hired Irvin Kershner to direct THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK on the strength of EYES OF LAURA MARS.

Blood doesn't always have to be in bulk. You just need an engrossing plot, a good twist, pretty models and some sleaziness to go with it.The tone changes from scene to scene, but it is beautifully shot, with clever writing and great dialogue, along with the actors that makes this movie work on so many levels. The scenes with Laura having a vision of another murder are very repetitive. The same thing happens. She's doing whatever, freezes in place, eyes go wide, mouth drops, and we see a blurred killer's-eye-view of who is dying. It's all very funny, but startling, because we know what Mars must be going through to endure such an eerie thing. The whodunnit element really works well throughout, as I was completely surprised when the true killer was revealed, The body count is quite high as well which will keep all true slasher fans happy, it's full of giallo tendencies. The stalking scenes and close-ups of the ice pick are just enough to add a psycho's tough to this underrated piece.Okay it's not perfect there are a few minor bad points, like the storyline do slow down in parts, like after a murder and the ending is also lacking thrills, but other than those points it's still a thrilling ride.The performances is what truly makes this movie work, Faye Dunaway is excellent as the lead Laura Mars, along with Tommy Lee Jones in one of his early roles as the detective and love interest, they're chemistry with each other and watching they're relationship develop further as the movie progressed was a real highlight. Brad Douriff a familiar face who would go on to play the infamous (Chucky) as a early role as the down and out limo driver, whose creepy and unsettling at the same time really works. The late Raul Julia plays the sleazy husband really well but we don't see enough of him, and the flamboyant friend Donald Phelps (Rene Auberjonois) was brilliant in his role, he switches from funny to serious really well and the models Lulu (Darlanne Fluegel) and Michele (Lisa Taylor) were stunning and a lot of fun, and this movie makes you feel for these characters especially when it comes to they're demise.So all in all a fashionable thriller with excellent performances with a fun 70's disco soundtrack and great suspenseful scenes.

In any case this sharp, stylish, thoughtful, emotionally deep, and visually beautiful mystery drama was to a great extent spoiled by some blunt bloke who apparently believed the 'people' would certainly like a regular 'trilla' with a 'hitchcock' ending to it. I wish I never saw the final 10 minutes and the tape would be just cut off instead...

It's a bit of a waste of such a fine main concept.Yes, this really could had been one fine supernatural thriller with lots of suspense and mystery. Instead the movie now is one filled with missed opportunities and wasted potential. Blame the script for that (written by none other than John Carpenter) that just doesn't provide the movie with much interesting or much tension. I mean you basically know from the beginning on that the movie is going to have a twist at the ending, so when it comes it's hardly a surprise or a shock anymore. Besides it's rather weak and thin, as is the entire movie its story basically.The movie could had also really used a bit more '70's style. Guess Irvin Kershner is a bit of a too old fashioned director to include some experimental '70's oddities, though it could had really uplifted the movie with that particular style.When you look at the cast list you will be rather impressed. However most of the actors (Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif, Rene Auberjonois, Raul Julia) weren't any big stars yet at the time of this movie and most of them still stood at the beginning of their career. Now days the cast list looks far more impressing than it did back in 1978. Faye Dunaway is the star of the movie and she shines as the female lead.As far as the genre- and '70's movies in general are concerned, this movie isn't among the best.

Laura later discovers that, in fact, she's seeing through the eyes of the psychopath(..see understands this as she sees the killer coming from behind her..imagine how eerie that must've been!). The attacks spontaneously appear, out of the blue & often when she's behind the camera about to shoot a series of photographs, hindering her new work for a client. Eventually her job becomes effected overall by these blunt visions which interfere with daily life, robbing her set-up programs with models causing pains for her agent(Rene Auberjonois)and employer(Michael Tucker), who can not understand with what Laura is dealing with. Detective on the case, John Neville(Tommy Lee Jones), not an admirer of her work deeming it morbid and sleazy junk, will attempt to catch the killer, finding it hard to accept her rather far-fetched explanations of sight, with them falling in love during the process. Another eerie coincidence Neville discovers is that many of Laura's (in)famous photographic works resemble crime scene photos taken after the fact, both taken only months apart. Could someone within Laura's entourage be the one committing these murders? Will Neville find the killer responsible before he/she comes after Laura? Why is the killer targeting people associated with Laura? I feel Eyes of Laura Mars, a film created from a story concocted by director John Carpenter(..perhaps inspired by the slate of Italian giallo thrillers populating the scene at the time), is very similar to the Italian giallo. I would go as far as to say, Eyes of Laura Mars is as close to an American giallo as one can ever get. As previously mentioned in the overall synopsis above, the proof is in the pudding so to speakYou have a crazy premise(fashion photographer of lurid commercial work can see through the eyes of a killer eliminating her friends and employers clairvoyantly, but is seemingly unable to stop the events before they transpire), lots of red herrings(could it be Brad Dourif, her grubby, chain-smoking chauffeur with a criminal record, or possibly Raul Julia her shady, alcoholic, money-hungry ex-husband?), a flawed, naive heroine(Faye Dunaway, who I felt was very Joan Crawford-esquire..no, I mean the way she carries herself and her whole demeanor, perhaps how she uses her eyes and waves her hair)who can not save those she loves, a hunky police detective she falls head-over-heels for(a very young Tommy Lee Jones), an inside look into the world of wealth and glamor, and the overall foray of eccentric personalities Dunaway comes in contact with on a daily basis(such as the flamboyant and self-absorbed agent Rene Auberjonois, who steals every scene he's in, spirited model Darlanne Fluegel).And, the gloved killer with a sharp instrument stabbing victims appropriately enough in the eyes. And, to top it off, a ridiculous reveal which has you saying to yourself Huh?! Yeah, I had fun with this one. Yes, it's convoluted and flawed just like many an Italian giallo, with resolutions which has you scratching your head. But, it has many of the traits I admire, as mentioned above add nauseum.

Its main area is as a horror/suspense film about a photographer named Laura Mars who sees deaths take place in her own eyes just as the murderer takes a knife to the eyes of his victim. Intriguing no doubt. Not surprising as the story comes from the mind of John Carpenter, and he could be called a lot of things but not creative isn't one of them. The film is paced fairly well and aided with some solid acting by Faye Dunaway as Laura Mars, Tommy Lee Jones as a policeman, Rene Auberjonois as Laura's agent, and Brad Douriff as an ex-con, hippie-like chauffeur for Mars. Who is the killer? Why is he killing anyone associated with Laura? Well, the resolution should hit you way before the ending of the film. It did at least for me. The script - while imaginative and truly well-shot - just seems to be lacking a lot to be honest. we are to take a lot of things for granted and some important things like how and why Laura can see the actions of the murderer are never even explained. What the film does have going for it is a strong sense of New York City and the aforementioned fashion world. Pretty girls in semi-clad outfits(or none at all) abound. There is also the clever shooting of the killing scenes and the tension they create. While this film is not by any means good, it is not bad at all and may be one of those films that requires a second viewing - sometime. The ending, as I said, was academic two-thirds in, and that will not change when I watch it again. "},{"Title":"I think it's tragic this is the kind of junk passing for art these days.

One night Laura has a vision, a vision of her publisher Doris Spenser (Meg Mundy) being brutally murdered, in her vision Laura 'sees' through the eyes of the killer so cannot identify them. Laura is obviously shocked when she learns that in reality Doris was killed & it's not long before her friend Elaine Cassel (Rose Gregorio) is killed in a similarly brutal fashion. The police have a hard time believing Laura but Lieutenant John Neville (Tommy Lee Jones) starts to as the killings continue, it's not long before Laura 'sees' herself being stalked by the killer & she is convinced she will be their next victim unless she can uncover their identity...Directed by Irvin Kershner I thought Eyes of Laura Mars was an OK thriller but nothing special. The script by John Carpenter & David Zelag Goodman (the producer brought the original script from Carpenter & hired Goodman to do a rewrite & he changed a few things most notably the identity of the killer at the end which Carpenter was unhappy about, apparently) along with some other 'uncredited' writers according to the IMDb takes itself extremely seriously & is your basic murder mystery with a touch of the supernatural thrown in to give the film some sort of gimmick, unfortunately the premise is never used to any great effect & is severely underdeveloped. For instance the film never even tries to explain why Laura is psychically connected to the killer or why she only has this connection when they kill, it felt very flimsy & almost an afterthought even if the basic concept is actually quite cool. The basic murder mystery elements aren't exactly top drawer either, now I don't want to boast but I guessed the killers identity really early into the film, the way I did it was to simply think about the character's, decide who was the most unlikely to have done it & I then figured the filmmakers would have chosen them because of that very fact & they wanted to 'surprise' the audience with a clever & 'unexpected' twist ending, when I was proved right I was pretty disappointed actually & the reasons behind their killing spree were unimaginative as well. Having said that it moves along at a decent enough pace, the character's & dialogue are OK although the film does tend to spend a bit too much time trying to develop insignificant secondary character's to no great effect. I was hoping for a little bit more to be honest.Director Kershner does an OK job, it's slickly made & has a nice look to it as it's set amongst the upper-class. The film never manages any edge of your seat moments & it's a bit pedestrian. The murders remind of those seen in Italian Giallo's by Dario Argento & the like with the point-of-view shot from the killers perspective as they let their black gloved hands in front of them do the acting. There's no real violence or gore, a few quick stabbings but nothing that's going to worry anyone. There's more nudity actually.With a supposed budget of about $7,000,000 Eyes of Laura Mars is well made & has that Hollywood polish to it. The acting is alright but I didn't buy the killer at the end & their motives.Eyes of Laura Mars is an OK murder mystery that could have incorporated it's supernatural elements a lot better, it's worth a watch for sure but it's nothing special & I really did guess the killers identity very early on & I'm positive I wasn't the first & I'm equally as positive I won't be the last either.

Most people, it turns out, do not openly self-identify as 'sleazy.'Laura Mars is a sleazy hybrid which imagines that Helmut Newton and Encyclopedia Brown occupy the same universe. The plot and its insipid characters are not worth describing. The movie is peopled with inarticulate, posturing cynics who are too shallow to be able to explain why they are, except maybe to sheepishly admit that cynical is the new black. The movie is objectionable not because it's about turning people into products, but because it turns film into a product to meet prurient interests, without one ounce of intelligence; inserting the merest excuse of thriller plotting, to make your attendance excusable. Sleaze consumption is the whole show, the theme and the meaning. The characters are all interested in consuming sleaze, just as you the viewer are made to when you watch this.How does an actor go from excellent work like 'Chinatown' and 'Network' to 'Laura Mars' and 'Mommie Dearest' w/o having contempt for themselves? I'm not sure, but by 1978 Faye Dunaway was in full-scale retreat from depth, success and class. The script is by John Carpenter, and it was produced by hair-stylist Jon Peters. That's really scraping. The only way it could be more putrid is if Joel Schumacher directed it; since he went on to direct a resume full of similar garbage.

The supernatural premise, penned down by no less than John Carpenter (Halloween, Assault on Precinct 13), is undoubtedly intriguing and rich on artistic opportunities, yet due to an incredible amount of production difficulties and constant re-writings of the script, it ended up being a hopelessly muddled and disappointing thriller. Carpenter gave up when he saw that his original idea got slowly turned into a gimmicky mystery, revolving more on the glossy charisma of its lead actress than on the actual trump of film a series of bizarre murders in the world of professional photography. Faye Dunaway stars as the female version of the controversial real-life artist Helmut Newton and exhibits shock-provoking photos that portray death, mayhem and prostitution in New York City. Suddenly and for reasons that remain unexplained, she can witness with her own eyes how a gloved serial killer brutally stabs her closest friends & co-workers to death. Laura's descriptions appear identical to how the murders were committed and thus the handsome Detective John Neville personally takes pity on her, as she unquestionably will become the killer's main target. Experienced horror/thriller fans that are slightly familiar with Italian cinema will immediately spot the similarities between this film and the typical gialli (= violent Italian murder-mysteries) of 70's and early 80's. Eyes of Laura Mars contains multiple trademarks of the giallo, but sadly lacks the stuff that makes them so fantastic, namely bloody gore and sleaze.

The premise isn't bad, and there are a few good ideas; but the execution is poor on the whole, and for every idea that does work; there's at least three that don't. Take the main idea for example - the plot follows Laura Mars; a New York artist who has blackouts, during which she witnesses the murderous rampages of the local serial killer. We then follow her and her policeman boyfriend as they try to track down the killer from her visions. Now, this is all well and good, but the film has completely forgotten to explain WHY this is happening to her, thus making it really hard for the audience to care about the plot. It didn't come as a surprise to me to find that John Carpenter wrote the script. After that, many other areas of the film aren't explained properly. The movie throws caution to the wind where characters are concerned, and they are merely a product of the plot itself, rather than the plot being impacted by the characters. This is a guaranteed formula for a cold audience, as it's hard to care anyway; but when it doesn't even give you reason to care for the characters themselves, it's too easy to switch off.Faye Dunaway has starred in some big films, such as Chinatown and Bonnie and Clyde; but her performance here isn't up there with those films. To be fair, she isn't given much to do - but despite convincing as New Yorker, she cant get into her character and on the whole, her performance isn't the work of a great actress. Tommy Lee Jones would go on to find real fame after this film, so it's a good job that he had some better roles later on, as his performance here is unlikely to have gained him many plaudits. Cult actor Brad Dourif rounds off the central core of actors and he, as usual, stands out the most. Also as usual, his performance isn't anything like brilliant; but Dourif knows how to entertain. The final nail in the coffin for this film is definitely the final twist. Usually, I have to start watching a film before the twist becomes guessable; but I guessed this one before I even saw the movie. Just reading the plot synopsis makes it obvious. On the whole, this film isn't a complete dead loss and if you like your supernatural thrillers, there may be something here. Just be prepared to allow it some room in the credibility department.

Some critics regard Laura as a major artistic talent and a glossy coffee table book of her photos is about to be published, but others regard her work as pornographic and exploitative and as encouraging real-life violence against women.Eyes of Laura Mars is a crime thriller, influenced to some extent by the work of Alfred Hitchcock. A series of people connected to Laura are brutally murdered. The first is the publisher of the forthcoming book, followed by a gallery owner who organised an exhibition of her work, two models who worked for her and her agent. The film also includes a supernatural element; Laura experiences a series of psychic visions of the murders as they occur, but because she sees everything from the killer's perspective she is unable to identify him. She realises that she herself is in danger and a young police officer, Lieutenant John Neville, is assigned to protect her. The two fall in love and begin an affair.The debate in the film about the merits of Laura Mars' work reflects the real-life debate which was taking place during the sixties and seventies between libertarians and moralists about the role of sex and violence in the media. The script was written by John Carpenter, better known as a director (although he did not direct this film), and the fact that the killer turns out to be a psychotic puritan motivated by moral objections to Laura's work might suggest what position Carpenter himself took in this debate.Producer Jon Peters originally intended the film as a vehicle for Barbra Streisand, who was his girlfriend at the time, but she turned it down (apparently because of the kinky nature of the story) and the role went eventually to Faye Dunaway. Dunaway gives a perfectly adequate performance, as does a young Tommy Lee Jones as Neville, but this is not one of her really great performances, certainly not when compared to something like Chinatown or Network for which she had recently won an Oscar.The film as a whole is a reasonably competent thriller, but is nothing out of the ordinary, at least in terms of its plotting and acting. Its basic woman in danger plot, stemming from films like Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, was becoming something of a cliché by the late seventies, and the twist ending is not an original one; it had, for example, been used by Agatha Christie in one of her most famous thrillers. (That, of course, has not prevented screenwriters from continuing to rely upon it; Along Came a Spider is an example of a more recent film which turns upon the same twist).Appropriately enough for a film about a photographer, the one thing that does stand out is the quality of the photography. The film was shot on location in New York and New Jersey, often against a background of the more run-down or industrial parts of the city, but director Irvin Kershner is able to invest these scenes with a remarkable freshness and strange beauty; the predominant characters are muted ones, especially greys and browns. The final result is a stylish film, if not a very substantial one. A glossy coffee table film. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Average US Giallo","Date":"22 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Controversial fashion photographer Laura MarsFaye Dunaway) begins to have visions of murders before they happen, unfortunately for her all the victims are women who are pictured in her upcoming book.

This murder is seen by Laura through the eyes of Doris' killer exactly and at the very moment that it happened! Were not really told in the film what has given Laura this extraordinary power of perception but it seems to be that she somehow got in-tuned with this very disturbed and sick individual through her obsession with violence and sex. That's very profitable in her cut-throat business, that Laura uses in her work in both art and fashion photography.It's very obvious that this unknown and unseen killer is somehow trying to get in contact with Laura, through her visions, in order to save himself from a life of madness and murder. That's exactly what happens at the very end of the movie as the killer comes out of the shadows showing Laura just how sick and insane he is. Tommy Lee Jones as the street smart NYC police detective, with a very pronounced southern accent, John Neville in one of his first staring role is very effective as Laura's lover and bodyguard. John try as he may just can't get a handle on who this guy stalking, and murdering, Laura and her friends really is.The movie has everyone who's a suspect, in the what turned out to be some half dozen murders, themselves ending up brutally murdered, usually with an ice pick in the head. By the process of elimination you can just about figure out who the killer, he or she, is. Seeing the killer do his work mostly on her friends and associates has Laura forgo her work and get hooked on sedatives, as well as Det. Neville. This only makes her deadly visions even more numerous as if the killer, who's eyes she's looking through, is putting on some kind of play for Laura in order to impress or reach out to her for help.We get a number of red herrings all through out the movie to just who this psycho is which all lead to dead ends.

It's at the very end of the film with almost everyone in the cast with the exception of Laura ending up dead is when we in the audience get an inkling to who this madman really is. It's when he finally comes out in the open you feel, with the mind-numbing and unbelievable performance that he gives, that you've really got your money's worth in staying with what up to then was a run of the mill horror/suspense thriller.

One by one, her associates and friends are brutally murdered and she gets to see it all...through the eyes of the killer at the very moment the crimes are committed. And when the mystery psycho suddenly becomes aware of Laura's gift, the murders begin striking closer to home, as he gets closer to her...A spec script originally written by HALLOWEEN maestro John Carpenter, it was snapped up by producer Jon Peters as a possible vehicle for then-wife Barbra Streisand. When she deemed it too violent and demanded certain changes, Carpenter knew when to take the money and run, so he did. David Zelag Goodman (LOGAN'S RUN) is credited with doing the subsequent rewrites which were handled by many others, of course.It isn't a complete mess, and even stands as a pretty vivid time capsule for capturing the look and feel of that period. Dunaway gives one of her signature solid performances, and Tommy Lee Jones is pretty good in this early role for him, as the cop that Laura turns to for protection and much more.An also pre-stardom Raul Julia (here featured as R.J. for some unknown reason) has what amounts to little more than a cameo, and just in case you had any doubts about the setting of this piece, Rene Auberjonois nearly peels the paint off the walls with his totally non-PC turn as Laura's flamboyant best friend and confidante. It's to his credit that the movie seems to lose a lot of its life when he's not on-screen, and his scenes indicate how much fun it could've been if it had just taken itself a little less seriously.Eagle-eyed buffs can also spot genre staple Brad Dourif and Darlanne Fluegel (TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.) as one of Laura's featured models.All in all, EYES is a fitful but entertaining glimpse back into the Me Decade, whose original ad campaign was much more clever and provocative than the movie itself. It's also one of the few films from the period that might possibly do well as a remake with the proper writer and director.Avid thriller readers, take note author Dean Koontz revisited this plot line in a similar fashion, in his excellent novel, THE VISION. There had been plans to turn it into a feature film, but they may have been scrapped because of the similarities to LAURA.

From her mind, she has a tendency to see the murders taking place, even though she is not physically witnessing the crimes in person. She hires a police bodyguard, John Neville, played by Tommy Lee Jones, and he grants her protection around the clock (and they fall in love). But even though she is being protected, more of her friends are being killed in such brutal ways. Little does she know that the killer is her police bodyguard. The movie also has Brad Dourif, who plays Laura's chauffeur. It is incredible for a character like Laura to mentally witness murders; which is impossible in real life. It is quite obvious that she did not predict these murders happening or that she was dreaming that they were taking place, they REALLY happened. I also learned that Barbra Streisand was first approached and asked if she wanted to play the title character in this film, but she turned it down, because she was still exhausted from her work on A Star is Born. However, she did agree to sing the title theme from the movie, Prisoner, which is a great rock song heard in full during the closing credits. This movie is a real thriller and may give you somewhat of a mild scare when the end comes. I like Faye Dunaway a lot and I think she did an excellent job in this role. Tommy Lee Jones was incredible in his role as well. Even though this movie is out on DVD, it almost seems to be a forgotten piece. The incidental music heard occasionally in the film can be scary as well. For those of you who have not yet seen this movie, go ahead and get it, and be prepared for a scare!!

The film hasn't aged well. This movie heralded what fashion photography was to become a decade, or so, later. Today's world of doped up models as pop culture heroines, no pun intended, probably imitated Laura Mars, the photographer with a taste for presenting the macabre and gory in order to sell clothes. Under Irvin Kershner's direction and a screen play by John Carpenter, this film feels empty.What makes it irrelevant is the fact we have a hint of who is the serial killer and his attraction toward Laura Mars. The clue is seen at the beginning of the film. As far as a mystery goes, there is not much suspense in the way we watch the story unfolds. In fact, knowing who the culprit is, makes no sense how easily Laura could have been eliminated. The criminal seeks to destroy all that seems to matter to Laura, not the person who is producing all the obscene and explicit pictures.Faye Dunaway and Tommy Lee Jones worked well together. Their passion, as seen on the screen is tamed and not kinky at all. The supporting cast is good, but Raul Julia has nothing to do in the movie. A curiosity for fashionistas.

I wish now I had left it where I had found it.This is a film that might have come off better if it had been filmed in Black and White. It is very suggestive of the noir genre atmospherically. Dunaway, who usually renders bravado performances, appears very vulnerable in this vehicle, and it does not come off well or as very convincing. There is no build up to her psychic vision, if that's what we can call it, where she is able to see the victims of murder as it happens, but cannot see the perpetrator of these crimes. As a photographer of some very violent scenes and a totally different animal altogether in that world, she has come under the gun from numerous angles, and some of the shots, unbeknownst to her, are exact matches to crime scene shots in the NYPD crime book. She comes under suspicion early, but is somewhat sheltered from the raw reality of it all by her effete agent, in the person of Rene Auberjunois, and a very young looking Tommy Lee Jones. This is 1978...I never knew T.L.J. was ever that young ! More killings ensue, and they are very close to home...her models, her associates. Raul Julia appears as part of the sub-plot to this gore fest as the ex-husband/failed writer, who winds up on the list of suspects in the killings...but who winds up being killed himself. Bad turns to worse as the sordid actions lead up to the trail of the REAL murderer. It's supposed to be a surprise ending or an ending with a twist, and while it may raise some eyebrows, the shock of it seems to have been dulled with the passage of some years, and where this might have been a shocker in its day of sailing relatively ( then) uncharted psychological waters, it comes off as pretty milque-toast today. I read that Barbra Streisand was originally cast for the role...but turned it down. Good judgment on her part. She did sing the theme song to the film, but does not appear. Far from being a classic, this film is little more than a pot-boiler and has not stood well the test of time. No doubt it did wonders for the careers of Jones and Auberjunois, but Dunaway didn't need the credits on her resume ( she had just won an Academy Award) and neither did Streisand. But, we would hear more from John Carpenter after this, as this was his initial salvo into the realm of cinema. I did not like the film, would not care to watch it again, and I cannot recommend it because so much could have been better, and so much could have been done differently.

Her eyes are bloodshot in virtually all her close-ups and the cinematography runs hot and cold. Sometimes she looks good, but most of the time she looks like Margo when they took her out of Shangri-La. During this time, Faye was having a lot of late nights which explains how she went from a sleek, flawless goddess in The Towering Inferno to this bleary, pasty, fleshy incarnation within a mere 4 years! Here she plays a controversial photographer who begins having violent visions of her acquaintances being murdered. Soon, she realizes that she is seeing these events through the killer's point of view and she is next! The film is often unintentionally hilarious, but never boring. Highlights of the fun include Faye wearing a funky newsboy cap that gives her face the most unflattering round shape akin to Charlie Brown, Faye running down the streets of New York as if her skirt is keeping her legs close together when actually there are waist high slits in it(!), Jones getting Faye's hair caught in his five o'clock shadow during one of their contortionistic love scenes, the inane and uproarious dialogue during the love scenes and in the faux-improvised, spontaneous moment of attraction in the park and the creme de la creme-- a screaming, whining man at a funeral whose reaction to his girlfriend's death is so over the top and fall-down-funny, it defies anyone to keep a straight face! The story is intriguing to a degree and it's neat to see one of the most natural actors (Jones) pair up with the queen of control (Dunaway) whose every move and inflection is choreographed. It'd be awesome to see them in a film together today. What hurts the film in some aspects is the amateurish acting by some of the lesser supporting cast (i.e.--the models, policemen, etc...), but Auberjonois is actually pretty amusing in his unusual role and really tries to give a performance (great Lloyd Bridges impersonation!) Oh...and though everyone knocks Babs Streisand's opening song, it's great...a campy power ballad that is sadly unknown today.

It was scary as heck when I first saw it - haunting music and all the rest.  In my opinion, 'Eyes of Laura Mars' was much better, in its time, than 'Minority Report'. (Same idea after all.)But BOB (boy oh boy) is this sucker dated. Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain are 60s and 80s.  Well, the 70s had Andy Gibb.  This movie is well, Gawd, I dunno.  Son of Sam?Barbra Streisand's hairdresser slash squeeze produced this movie (she sang a song) and then he apparently ripped off Japanese investors in the Sony-Columbia deal.  So, call it an historical artefact. But like 'Roman Holiday', I still think it's a good idea.  Wanna see a 70s scary movie?  Rent this one.

I had no idea that Tommy Lee Jones was in it. Both he and Faye are very good, but the artfulness of the direction, which starts out at a high level, gets flabbier and flabbier, and the story just gets looser and looser until we reach the utterly ludicrous and insensible conclusion.The direction was quite good at the beginning. A lot of the shots were very lovely and created a great deal of tension-- ah, how I miss the days when even crap thrillers were directed with some style and sense of composition. The whole concept of the controversial photographs with the sex and murder would still be relevant today, but they drop that whole area of inquiry pretty quickly. I personally liked the sudden-realization-of-love sequence, it was so out there it actually seemed somewhat plausible, and Faye and Tommy are two pros who can make everything, if not believable, at least interesting. I was quite impressed with the sensitivity TLJ let his character show. For a long time, the film successfully maintains a good level of characterization and interesting social backdrop. But it quickly gets boring and falls victim to the need to have a thrill every few minutes. Faye has to keep having visions to keep the movie rolling along, and they get repetitive, and boy, that killer must really be busy in order to keep up with her! By the end we've just got a total mess and feel used.The best thing about this movie is its evocation of the chic 70s, with the 'glamour' and music and 'fabulous' apartments, mixed with stuff you wouldn't think was chic at all-- like singing 'for he's a jolly good fellow' at someone's birthday!! Oh dear. And then Barbra Streisand's love theme really caps off the cheese-o- meter.

The most unbelievable thing is that it was co-written by the (usually) great John Carpenter. Pity he didn't direct also, because it just might have saved this mess!It's impossible all these years later to watch this as a straight thriller, as it hasn't aged well. But if you treat it as a el primo slice of 70s camp you'll be in for a good time. Remember the 70s disco and coke culture sent up in 'Boogie Nights'? Well this is it for real and almost equally as funny! (just wait til you get a load of Laura's disturbing photos! Ooo-er.)A good cast (Dunaway, Jones, Dourif) ham it up for all that it is worth, and simply the sight of Rene Auberjonois and Michael Tucker (better known now for 'Deep Space Nine' and 'L.A. Law' respectively) with cool, with it haircuts is worth at least oh, half an hour of chuckles.You'll probably guess who the killer is within the first twenty minutes, but whether you do or not, by the end you won't even care. Still, you'll have had a good time, I'm certain. They really DON'T make them like that anymore!

It could be put in a time capsule for the late 70's.  A slasher movie written by John Carpenter which takes place in the chic world of high fashion and disco!  Faye Dunaway's performance is larger-than-life as a kinky fashion photographer who suddenly finds herself seeing through the eyes of a killer stalking all of her models and pals! This is not a work of art in the sense of great film making, but it is well worth watching.  The musical score is great and even features a rock theme song performed by Barbra Streisand!  ...Her then boyfriend was the producer. Which is the only reason one can think of that she would be singing a song for a horror movie.  Check it out!

Detective Neville (Jones) does his best to try and figure out whose visions she is seeing but runs into walls with every lead.And there are so many guilty (or guilty-looking) parties here that who it could be is anyone's guess. Until the end, when....Oh no, that would be too easy. If you haven't seen very many movies like this (are there many?), it'll be all the more a shock. If you have, well, you probably already know, but why spoil it for everyone else?And if you ever wanted to see what high fashion looked like in 1978, here's your big chance.Rent The Eyes of Laura Mars and see what cool really is, baby.Six stars.Oh, one more thing, if you knew you had visions that impaired your own actual sight, would you go out driving?Me neither.

The setting is the backdrop canvas for the story involving paranormal sight and a crime spree. The world seems strange to peoplelike me...I mean the high art scene then again it was supposed to. The alien world within society...a small society set within the great community of humanity was interesting. "}]
