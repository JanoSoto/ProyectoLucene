The dignified, regal Fishbourne transforms Othello into a tragic figure with restraint, control and believability. It was also an added surprise to see two actors from Brahagh's Hamlet Michael Maloney and Nicholas Farrel. And any film with Nathaniel Parker is a pleasure. Branagh brought a depth to Iago that I hadn't seen before, especially during the scene on the beach when he and Othello hug. Iago in tears? And then again at the final scene. Iago was evil, yes, but for an actor to find a few moments to make him human -that's when the audience knows something extraordinary has happened on stage or screen. See this film.

Luckily, the cuts and alterations that he has made do little damage to the old Shakesperean chestnut. I wouldn't say that any of the tweaks are particularly for the better, but the essence of Shakespeare's tale of envy, jealousy and deceit is so powerful that it would take a bungling fool - an Ed Wood wannabe, for instance - to rob it of its power. The weighty themes shine through as strongly as ever in this latest presentation. Laurence Fishburne plays the titular character, a renowned Moorish soldier. His courage has impressed young Venetian lady Desdemona (Irene Jacob) and the pair of them secretly marry. However, her father is displeased by this secret ceremony and he warns Othello that if she can deceive her own father then she may one day do the same to him. One of Othello's soldiers, Iago (Kenneth Branagh) fails to get a promotion of rank which he feels he deserves, and to gain revenge he engineers a series of lies and incidents designed to convince Othello that his wife is being disloyal to him by fornicating with another man. Inevitably, viewers may find themselves comparing this version with other productions. How does it rank alongside the 1952 Orson Welles version and the 1965 Laurence Olivier one? To be honest, it depends upon the viewer. Purists would probably opt for the Olivier offering, since it is only very slightly abridged and contains such strong performances that all four lead actors earned Oscar nominations. Film buffs might go for the Welles version, with its moody b&w lighting and a now-classic murder scene, not to mention the fact that the production history itself is as fascinating as the story. This version will undoubtedly find favour with viewers more inclined towards modern tastes. It has high production values, a sweeping score, accessible delivery of the lines, flashy photography, and cool stylistic touches (Fishburne's head tattoo, for instance). Personally, I feel the 1952 Othello will always be the benchmark, but this one is reasonably well made and it compares quite favourably with other versions.

His performance is excellent, while not overpowering the villainous Iago. And the title role is played by a black man, as it should be, rather than a white man with boot-polish on his face. The film's marginal eroticism has been criticised, but isn't eroticism at the very heart of the story? Olivier's Othello was essentially a film of the stage production, and for me the Orson Welles version was a failure, despite Welles' star performance, because most of the other actors were almost devoid of charisma. How could Desdemona possibly have been interested in a slob like Welles' Cassio?I have always found the original play unconvincing, for several reasons. Iago's motive, resentment of Cassio's promotion, seems too trivial for the tragedy it precipitates. At risk of committing heresy, I found the Verdi opera more convincing, with the soliloquy by Iago explaining his innate determination to commit evil.Also, given the closeness of Othello's friendship with Iago, his decision to bypass him in favour of Cassio makes little sense. Likewise, Othello's readiness to believe the worst of Desdemona, and the ease with which Iago leads him on to murder, makes the title character look quite pathetic, almost simple-minded.In this film, the cutting of the text to the absolute minimum helps to hide the play's inherent faults and tighten the action, and Fishbourne's wordless suffering speaks volumes that more than make up for the loss of Shakespeare's lines. I couldn't help comparing this film with Kenneth Brannagh's Hamlet, the longest and most tedious of his self-advertisements, in which every long-winded speech was preserved intact. Here Brannagh's Iago is almost as good as Fishbourne's Othello, and he makes the most of the lines he has.To sum up, ten out of ten. I can only regret that Fishbourne is not offered more roles of this quality.

I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. I mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why Othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also watched this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.Othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello snuck off with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who has stood by Othello. Due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he just mearly hints at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, never says that they are, just makes Othello think that it's happening. Othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him out.Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. Othello the movie is also great and once again I recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him.

Fishburne's expresses to the viewer Othello's torment as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode.  Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered).  Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized.  The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they, like Iago, seem more crucial to the plot.  I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well.If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more.  The director had a great cast, and no one offered a bad performance.  The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film.  I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get a sense of this very late into the movie.  Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together.  Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met.

Shakespeare himself invented the reflective human in the first place, and the play itself has power. But anyone looking for this power doesn't go to the movies, they read the play. There's just too much engagement and too many levels to appreciate without the magical space that reading creates.No, we go to the movies to see what people have done with these opportunities. Its a metatext of sorts. Engineering a film like this is a matter of tradeoffs and (in the best case) commitments to a world view that because of the richness of the plays can be as rich themselves. Olivier did not understand this because he never understood film. But Branagh does. In his films, he does not make the choices one would expect centering on the actor and emphasizing the language. Instead, he focuses on the space between the film and our minds and engages in an internal dialog about being and representation. He's chosen the few plays that work well with this.But Branagh is only a player here, and the decisions have been made by Parker. Parker is a smart artist who takes a wholly different approach; he's done it here and with the Wilde projects afterwards. In this world, the language is the center not the metaphoric abstractions, embellishments and introspections but the language as a dramatic citizen. That language is imbued with force. Around this force, everything moves.Fishburne is a good choice for this strategy. I know of no other black actor who works with the language this way. Its a particular challenge for african-americans because the use of language takes on a personal identity in that `culture' and most black actors leverage their identity as a tool in addressing a role. Not Fishburne, he's a real actor in the sense that he understands the difference between who he his and what his instrument is.Branagh is given a strange task to do here. His special strength is the ability to create that abstract metalayer, put it between us and keep it alive. But Parker will have none of that. Instead, all the metastuff is pushed into the more direct method of Iago's looking at and speaking to the camera. Its not very satisfying, but one can see why it is done.Similarly, Desdemona and all the other woman are treated by Parker the same way he did with his Wilde adaptations they are secondclass beings, existing only as marks for the movement. Demoting her thus was necessary for the strategy I suppose. But it is a major loss, transforming the play into being about Othello alone, instead of the rich confabulation of conflicting forces of life in the `real' play. She has her erotic moments instead, but this is like the Branagh camera-glances -- a pale substitute for her richer life of sense and passion.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

The language is some of Shakespeare's most complex, yet when understood, also some of the most eloquent and beautiful ever written.The film had a lot to live up to.(This may contain plot spoilers.)In my opinion, Fishburne was an excellent Othello - brooding, jealous, suspicious, in anguish - everything I expected. He spoke the lines well and had great presence. Irene Jacob as Desdemona wasn't such a powerful character, but then was never intended to be - even in the play she was depicted as weak, although she does have her stronger characteristics, she is inherently not one of the most important or complex characters.No, for me it was, as always, Branagh, who stole the show. A wonderfully chilling performance, which left me convinced that Iago was possibly the most evil villain I have come across in any of Shakespeare's works. He shows no remorse, no emotion, but simply calculation and cruelty. He plots evil for evil's sake, and Branagh portrayed this very well. If you watch it, it's in his eyes, the way he looks at the others and at the camera - it ranges from impassivity to pure, unadulterated evil. Iago is not simply a baddie - he is a demi-devil, fuelled by nothing more than the desire to harm others. Iago seems to have no real motive, although several are given (jealousy of Othello and Desdemona, racism, hatred of Othello, anger of being passed over for promotion etc etc), but I believe that he is not intended to have a motive - he is evil simply because that is his way, and he needs no motive.Some people have criticised the film for not showing enough of Desdemona and Othello together, or that it seems odd that Iago has so much hatred for Othello and that his plan culminates so quickly. This is from the Shakespeare, where the concept of double time is used. There are two time frames, it seems, in the play, which is hard to put across in a film, but which I think worked well enough that I wasn't bothered by it. It all happens in a few days, in one time frame, but we get the impression that it takes far longer than this. This is difficult to get your head around, but it does make some kind of sense. ) Anyway, they couldn't have added bits in without adding to Shakespeare's lines, and I'd rather they didn't do that. )Overall, a very good film adaptation of a wonderfully moving and disturbing play. I highly recommend it.

Brannagh is the man who knows when it comes to the Bard, and being a slightly different part to play for him (and he wasn't directing it) it seemed very interesting. And he pulled off the character wonderfully.He managed to play Iago with just enough flourish without making everything obvious. If I didn't already know the story I may have though he was telling the truth half of the time.Fishburne himself actually gives in a good if somewhat restrained performance and Irene Jacob as Desdemona is convincing, but it is the boy from Belfast, Brannagh, who steals the show.There are many excellent minor performances in the movie also, Michael Maloney as Rodrigo and Anna Patrick as Emilia to name but two.Parker's direction of the piece is also very good, especially visually, the love scenes with the black/white skin are a bit obvious, but still a nice touch.The bottom line for me, would be if you enjoy Shakespeare and Othello isn't on at your local Theatre - rent the video, or go to the cinema to see this version - you won't be disappointed.

Like Glenn Close as the Marquise de Merteuil, but better, he makes Iago human, but still very sadistic. The beginning of the film is perfect. We see everything from the point of view of Iago, making us his accomplices in many ways, as he talks directly to us. Then, at the end, we lose him and Oliver Parker makes the great ending of the play way too long and we quickly get bored and annoyed at the melodrama of the last scene. Until the end, it is a great Shakespearian film. It is almost as if the same director as The Merchant of Venice (2004) made this. This is because both Parker and Redford adapt Shakespeare, not to make auteur films, like Orson Welles did, but to make them as Shakespeare would have were he alive at the time of cinema.

Enraged that he has been passed over for a promotion, Iago develops an elaborate plan to strike revenge against the man who passed him over, Othello. Presenting the danger of isolation as a master manipulator takes advantage of another man, Othello plays out a cautionary tale of power and struggle.Iago (Kenneth Branagh) is furious that his loyalty and civility has been overshadowed by another, and he instantly begins devising an elaborate plot to seek revenge against Othello and bring about his downfall. Becoming obsessed with his master plot, Iago develops a narcissistic addiction to bringing about Othello's downfall.The highlight of this film is the acting of Kenneth Branagh's Iago. He plays the role in a deliberate calculating method, just as the character begs to be played. Laurence Fishburne's turn in the titular role was excellent as well. the action is centered around Fishburne, but he is a secondary character to that of the manipulator Iago. Fishburne plays this distinction well and the film prospers from his lead role.Days ago after my initial viewing of this film, I thought it was wonderful; after taking some time to process it, however, I think it was pretty forgettable. Initially, I thought the wall-breaking of Branagh was a fun way to engage the audience, but otherwise, I wasn't much engaged. As good as Branagh's Iago was, it was played differently than I imagined from the Shakespeare original.

The story even with the cuts is still the incredible, complex story that I fell in love with. The love scenes have such a haunting and erotic quality to them especially. The very final scene is perhaps a tad too drawn out but it is also very beautifully played especially by Fishburne and the last moments are moving. The dialogue is wonderful as you would expect, it is not always the Shakespearean language but it is still intelligent and thought-provoking with a lot of complexity.Oliver Parker brings an assured and efficient touch to his direction, and the acting is superb. Michael Maloney, Nicholas Farrell, Nathaniel Parker and especially Anna Patrick are excellent in support, but the standouts were Laurence Fishburne's brilliant and very powerful yet restrained Othello and Kenneth Branagh in a literally seething albeit sometimes human account of the evil-incarnate character of Iago. Irene Jacob wasn't quite as good, Desdemona is a very delicate and poignant character, and while Jacob does what she can looking suitably delicate and beautiful her performance was a little on the dull side for me.I also have to agree on a side note that those into opera should see or hear Verdi's Otello, the music is phenomenal and Iago's Credo is living proof in my opinion that the original source material can be improved upon as you see much more of Iago's villainy. Overall though for this 1995 Othello, this is an excellent film and while not my favourite I do recommend it. 8.5-9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Only gets a 10 because you should see Branagh","Date":"29 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I just watched the full length version of the play, televised by BBC in 1981 with Anthony Hopkins in the title role of Othello and Bob Hoskins playing Iago. It made me realize just how much the Fishburne/Branagh version from 1995 suffers by being cut to ribbons to fit in a much shorter time slot. The director finds time for sex scenes but leaves out scenes that are vital to fully understanding the background and the relationships and what is going on.The film is good, but should have been longer. Laurence Fishburne is good in the title role but not incredible, and again, he is missing some of his best lines due to editing. Irene Jacob is a bit weak as Desdemona and I do think it may have to do with English not being her native tongue. Kenneth Branagh as Iago virtually steals every scene he is in. He is just delicious. Fortunately he is in most of the scenes. He is evil even when he is about to make love to his wife, perhaps not in a way that she would like at all, from what I could tell.See it but then see one of the versions that does not have so much text cut out. "},{"Title":"The First Version Of Othello In Which It Really Made Me Weep","Date":"22 January 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Students often ask me why I choose this version of Othello. Shakespeare's text is strongly truncated and the film contains material which earned it an R rating.I have several reasons for using this production First, I had not seen a depiction of the Moor that actually made me sympathetic to Othello until I saw Fishburne play him. I saw James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer play Othello and Iago on Broadway, and it was wonderful. Plummer's energy was especially noticeable. But in spite of Jone's incredible presence both physically and vocally, the character he played just seemed too passive to illicit from me a complete emotional purgation in the Aristotelian sense. Jones, in fact, affirmed what I felt when in an interview he noted that he had played Othello as passive--seeing Iago as basically doing him over. Unfortunately this sapped my grief for the character destruction. Thus, I felt sympathy for Jone's Moor but not the horror over his corruption by an evil man. In contrast, Fishburne's Othello is a strong and vigorous figure familiar with taking action. Thus, Iago's temptation to actively deal with what is presented to Othello as his wife's unfaithfulness is a perversion of the general's positive quality to be active not passive.1 The horror of the story is that this good quality in Othello becomes perverted. Fishburne's depiction is therefore classically tragic.Second, Fishburne is the first black actor to play Othello in a film. Both Orsen Wells and Anthony Hopkins did fine film versions, but they were white men in black face.2 Why is this important? Why should a Black actor be the Black man on the stage?3 Certainly in Shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls. Perhaps then, the reason is the same. Female actors bring a special quality to female roles on the Shakespearian stage because they understand best what Shakespeare's genius was trying to present. A gifted black actor should play the moor because his experience in a white dominated culture is vital to understanding what Shakespeare's genius recognized the pain of being marginalized because of race. An important theme in Othello is isolation caused by racism. Although it is a mistake to insert American racism into a Shakespearian play, there can be little doubt that racism is still working among the characters. Many, including Desdimona's father, think that a union between a Venetian white Christian woman and a North African black Christian man is UNNATURAL.Third, Shakespeare was never G rated. He never has been. His stage productions were always typified by violence and strong language. But Shakespeare's genius uses these elements not as sensationialism but for artistic honesty.

The scenery's wonderful (Cala Violina is a magnificent place and that's why the film was familiar to me because I go there often on holiday and the rock Othello's sat on is the one on which I used to catch crabs when I was younger... ^^), the actors, especially Branagh, are superb and I even was surprised by Laurence Fishburne's performance... Well everything's good, I think (although I don't like Othello saying 'Amen' like 'Hey men' instead of 'aaah men', and the place where Desdemona is in Venice is not the rights place, but those are details...) So, it's a very good film you Shakespearians should know. Welles' Othello possibly remains the best one because of its script. The ending's better because it's quicker but the text got much changed from the play. Also, the music of Othello (1995 version) composed by Charlie Mole is very beautiful I think.

His film brought out colors I had never noticed or considered.  Great handling of Roderigo.  (I wonder if some of this was due to the smart Kenneth Branagh.) For me the film suffers by not having a classically tragic scope.  It looks nice, but it is missing the momentum of a tragedy ordained by the gods, moving inexorably to its conclusion, which is so apparent in Welles' over-wrought production.  Fishburne is a good actor, and I found his Othello very moving, though missing a touch of the stuff myths are made of. Branagh is certainly Olivier's heir  dazzlingly brilliant, but missing the surprise of emotional spontaneity.  Though I admire Irene Jacob, I would have preferred an actress with a stronger command of English.  I think this Othello is a very worthy film, however.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.

I don't know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the film. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. SUrprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare just as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British vs. American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. It's quite a great scene at the end of the film but I won't reveal the ending. IT's just worth watching. I think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit Shakespeare.

If you love Kenneth Branagh's magnificent masterpieces Much ado about nothing (1993) and Hamlet (1996) as much as I do I'm dead certain you'll also find Oliver Parker's Othello irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career. He was quite terrific in Boys n the hood (1991) - I've always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles as his very greatest achievement. That was, of course, way before I saw this.He plays the part of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked, manipulate villain Iago. Marvelous Othello is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's ingenious works. It deals with his favorite topics crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy. This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films I've seen that's based on William Shakespeare's plays.

The problem, of course, was that he was deaf and thus couldn't understand the basis of day-to-day life.  Either a genius or a lunatic, you decide.Translating Shakespeare into the context of film (a good 300 years apart) takes  a degree of Beethoven acting itself.  The production must turn a blind eye to the world itself and be obsessed with their work in order to make a satisfactory Shakespeare adaptation.  I am tough on Shakespeare versions for this very reason, if the producers have the guts to make one, it better be great.Othello is an interesting combination of teen ideas set in the adult world.  For once, a director with some sort of vision is put in charge, and we get a better movie.  It's too bad that Oliver Parker hasn't done anything similar because he understands the film and context better than Olivier or Branagh.Laurence Fishburne is particularly interesting as Othello, I find it insulting that he degraded himself with Matrix Reloaded.  He knows the rhythm of Shakespeare, so his dialog is better than everyone else.  There is Iago (Kenneth Branagh actually doing something constructive with the source material! SHOCKING!), the scurvy friend with too much time to himself.  His asides are no different than Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and almost as witty.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast (once again) don't get any sympathies from me.The camera is once again blank, torn between wanting to search for something interesting and being bound to the rules of the film world.  How many films since The Terminator have used the (in)famous clenched hands during sex shot?Overall, a better film version of the Bard.  More worthwhile than most, 3 out of 5 stars.

In gravitas and and enacting jealous fits, Fishburne gives an absolutely absurd performance. Yah-GO! On the other hand, as Amelia (Mrs. Iago) is sublime. She has a low voice that is gracious and weary, pitying the priveleged dummies who provide her livelihood.

It is unjust. It is needed that a great actor should be Iago, but here in this perfect performance from Kenneth Branagh, we are abused.  We are shorted our Othello.  The camera lingers on handsome Iago, catches his every thought - but the Moor is more a distant spectacle, meted more thriftily the camera's time and the microphone's.  We see him feast, dance, fight, consummate his vows, but we don't get the Promethean heat. Our hero is tormented by salacious visions, unnecessary, over-long, and ineffective.  Fishburne is obviously comfortable with Shakespeare and capable of the range of emotions, but he stays too aloof, too formal. He is most tormented by the mere idea of Desi's disloyalty, tbe matter of proof and of her more incriminating acts are de-emphasized, and doubt (of Iago) holds no place.   All pathos is Desdemona's and much of hers taken, too. The music is quite good, including Iago's and Desi's songs.  Roderigo and Cassio well done.  Desdemona has an annoying accent and too much of a single look - very young and innocent.  Emilia quite good.  The whole doesn't hold together.  I love Branagh, I think Fishburne could do better, but Orson Welles is still the standard for Othello, piteous, subtle, a man driven by irresistible suggestion, whereas Fishburne seems willingly to go along, and kills more violently than gently and regretfully.  Perhaps it is an unwhitewashed Othello...

They should be proven wrong with this endeavour.  Oliver Parker's vision of homoeroticism and the trappings of masculinity transfers easily on-screen, with the help of the wonderful Laurence Fishburne as one of filmdom's best Othellos.After watching Welles and Olivier in their performances as a black-faced Moor, Fishburne is a breath of fresh air, and comes across as the first actor who has ever portrayed Othello's truth on-screen.  Fishburne plays subtext wonderfully, playing out the very real human flaws that are rooted in ego and pride that make Othello a haunting and complex character.  Irene Jacob is Desdemona as a sensual force drawn into a powerful sexual relationship with a dangerous man. The love scenes between Othello and Desdemona - scenes Shakespeare could only fantasize about - are haunting with their near-mysticism and erotica.  Very effective.One of the hidden gems of this film is Anna Patrick's very powerful performance as Iago's wife Emilia.  This wonderful actress gives Emilia the power and complexity of personality that it needs to encourage examination of Shakespeare's commentary on women in this play.The only downside to this wonderful film is the casting of Kenneth Branagh in the role of Iago.  If anyone imagines Shakespeare's ultimate villain as a dark and serpentine presence, they will be disappointed in Branagh's performance.  Fair-haired and playing British-boarding-school-mommy's-boy, Branagh is a strange choice for the role of Iago.  His sporadic asides with the audience are more satirical than serious, forced than innovative.  His handling of Shakespearian dialogue is characteristically academic and not personable enough.  Fishburne is living the part, whereas Branagh reads it. However, if you want to consider Iago as an effeminate and baby-faced schemer who has major issues about his masculinity, then Branagh is your man.An erotic and dark rendering of one of Shakespeare's most famous works, Oliver Parker's OTHELLO is definitely worth the time for its direction, its unique interpretation, and Laurence Fishburne, who makes Othello into one of the most dangerous and masculine sexual presences on film.
