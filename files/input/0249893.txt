Before watching it, keep in mind it was made on a shoestring budget, and the script was written, piecemeal, while the film was being shot. That's right there was NO SCRIPT before filming started.This said, I can say I found this movie fun and refreshing, if a little rough around the edges. It made little sense, but that's part of the ride. Danielle Cormack is the next big thing to watch out for...her face is like no other in Hollywood, she has enormous screen presense, and she's a natural in any role she undertakes. As the female lead in The Price of Milk, she's a joy to watch.Prepare yourself for an unusual film experience, chalk up the less than polished look of the movie to the low budget and brave experiment of making it up as they went along, and I think you'll enjoy this funny,  tender, little film.

On the downside, it can get a bit long sometimes and I think could have been edited a little better, i.e., cutting short some scenes, and at times Lucinda's character seems unrealistic and even downright stupid. But the payoff is some hilariously absurd scenes and concepts--my favorite was the dog in the box. I'd recommend this movie, but don't go into it expecting something breathtaking. It's first and foremost absurdist.

But this is a small lost jewel. It mixes a love triangle with some magic, some superstition. But the best in this film is not the romance; the best and the most well-performed genre in the film is the comedy. The actors did a great job, they feel really, really natural for a low-budget film. There's even some black comedy in it. And it's all so damn funny without being irrelevant.

I enjoy watching movies, sometimes just for the experience of seeing how they were made. Or wondering why they were made. This one sort of falls into the latter category. It can be fun to watch, if you have the proper frame of mind.Rob is a serious, hard-working man in rural New Zealand. He has a large herd of dairy cattle, just a few less than 200. He doesn't know them by name, unless you consider number 47 a name. But he addresses them very affectionately, we instantly know he loves his milk cows.Rob's girlfriend is Lucinda, they are getting married, but she does various tests to make sure he loves her, since Rob is not very demonstrative. One of them is to show up swimming in his large vat of milk, ruining Rob says 1500 dollars of milk (New Zealand dollars, I presume). That is where the movie gets its title, I suppose, The price of milk. Now if I had been Rob, I would have written Lucinda off as too crazy, too high-maintenance to endure. And especially so after she decides to sell my herd of milk cows to buy back a quilt that was stolen off them at night. But I am American, and apparently New Zealander sentiments run quite different.Anyway it is a quirky story. It includes a dog that is afraid of the outsides so it goes around under an inverted lid-less cardboard box. There is a curve that must be tricky because often the car will skid of the road and end up inverted. But they seem to accept that as a normal occurrence.So see it if you are in the mood for a very quirky movie that doesn't always make sense. Danielle Cormack is Lucinda. Karl Urban Rob. And Willa O'Neill is Drosophila, Lucinda's friend who gives her sometimes questionable advice.

Danielle Cormack plays Lucinda, a beautiful young woman living on a dairy farm with her lover, Rob (Karl Urban). For reasons not totally clear, Lucinda takes the advice of her friend Drosophila (Willa O'Neill) and does some truly hateful things to determine whether Rob really loves her. (The friend's name is a joke--Drosophila is the Latin word for fruit fly.)The film is very strange. Apparently, the actors and director hung out on the set and made up dialog and action as they went along. Maori characters appear and disappear, and one of them is a (sort of) kindly witch. This type of effort can be charming, but in this case it didn't work--at least not for me.The Price of Milk had some definite strengths. Danielle Cormack is a sophisticated movie star, but she's able to convince us that she's a simple farm girl who enjoys taking a bath in milk. The scenery is lush and green. The movie is true to itself--it never steps back and says, OK, now the magical part is over and we get real. There's an Indian wedding ceremony, and an agoraphobic dog that walks around covered by a carton. (How bad can a movie be when an agoraphobic dog is a member of the supporting cast?)This movie is worth seeing if you run across it. I don't think it's worth seeking out. Incidentally, we saw this film on DVD. The New Zealand scenery would probably be even more beautiful on a large screen.

It is supported by a whole class of intelligent artists. Though it is potentially rich we usually have this world delivered in order to surround sex in some way not usually available.I find myself wishing for other filmmakers to use this -- what is usually called magical realism -- in different ways.Hal Hartley, Atom Egoyan, Guy Maddin, even early Cronenberg Maddin made me hope that a Canadian tradition would sustain a second tradition, one with more powerful emotional abstractions not so dependent on genitals.Here in New Zealand films, I may have discovered another possible home for my constructive retreats.This little film tries all sorts of magical things. That they often are unsuccessful and often have no connective logic makes them more attractive, more engaging. All the magic here is cinematic, every device.Three shots were pretty memorable. One had a long red silk fabric train while our actress walked diagonally across the bright green hill we were by then familiar with. One was when we re-enter the world of physical touch that we had hoped for. Her hand appears from nowhere to caress his head. Very rewarding.The third is of a different order. I won't describe it in detail but it is the payoff, built up through many images. It is of a young woman reaching for the shod foot of a toddler sticking out of a cloud and not quite reachable. Its really quite lovely. The woman in question is truly a striking actress, Danielle Cormack, who seems to limit herself to local indie films and stupid TeeVee. Well, she is one of the best mouth actresses I have seen.I really liked this. It seems to be a voyage through womanhood for men, and I learned.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

It is very surreal and very strange but rather than detract from the story, the fairytale elements add to it, giving the whole thing a magical, if slightly insane, feel.I was already laughing even before the opening credits finished, but the movie as a whole is well-balanced between comedy and drama. (And there's an actual coherent plot in there, really). Though the story focuses mainly on Lucinda, the mistakes she makes and her attempts to put them right and win back Rob's heart, it's Rob himself that I feel for throughout the movie.It's not without flaws (no movie is without flaws). Lucinda comes across as a bit of a fruit-loop, with her collection of baby shoes and going nuts with a rifle. Also I wasn't always sure if I was watching a deliberately surreal happening, or if it was just a continuity error (of which there seemed to be several).But there is some stunning screenplay here; in particular, Lucinda running across a green hillside in a red sari with the long train trailing behind. In the end the flaws don't actually matter that much. Not everyone will understand this movie, but that's not its purpose. The secret to this one is just to relax and not try too hard.

Having your own way in the heat of anger. Letting people treat you as less than what you are. Giving way to uncertainty because making that stand is just too frightening. And then, taking it all, the risks, letting magic in. Karl Urban and Danielle Cormack are delightful as the Farmer in the Dell and Rapunzel, thrown together into a New Zealand Maori-laced tale with soundtrack by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra.

From the quilt introduction of the actors, through milky way love-making, Ms Jackson's heating techniques (my personal favorite), everything in this movie is original, or maybe I should say almost everything (dog moving under the box as a result of agoraphobia), but again the scene of the lead male role stroking the box as in reward-patting gesture, or carefree smoke in a car turned upside-down on the curve end has that inspiring touch of surprise delight.Finally, fantasy tales seem to be receiving marching orders both from our real and movie lives, being probably yet another product not suitable for mass consumption.

My initial viewing began as I was surfing through the channels (watching movies is a great pastime for college students) and came across this movie during the halfway point. I liked the bits that I saw so much that I tried to tape it the next time it came on, but my VCR ate the tape. For some reason, every single time that I tried to watch it when it came on TV, something would come up and I could never watch the entire film. The first time I got to watch it was X-mas 2002 when I stayed up til 5 am just so I could watch it uninterrupted. I have since bought a DVD of it.What really drew my attention was the music and the cinematography. The part of the movie that has really stayed fresh in my mind is when Lucinda is wearing the sari and is coming across the mountain looking for Rob. The way the material (and the contrast of it) drapes against the mountain is somewhat breathtaking. The classical piece that is playing then is called The Distant Princess and Harry Sinclair (director) really knew how to cue the visual shot and the music so they could be played at the right time. If you're the type of person to be stirred by visuals and soundtrack, this is a great movie to watch.Who cares if this movie was pieced together? These kind of movies have a wonderful, quirky sensibility to them. On the DVD, Harry Sinclair and Danielle Cormack comment on how the movie was filmed and how interesting it was to NOT have a script written beforehand. Sinclair mentioned that he didn't want the actors to be too rehearsed and then have the lines sound too cheesy. He also mentions that he thought of the plot one day while riding around in NZ in his car listening to a classical music piece. (Most likely,one of the one's in the film)Now, not everyone can get away with saying that there was nothing wrong with the movie. One of things that really bothered me was Auntie's, Mrs. Jackson's, furry pink hat. I wanted to shoot that thing! It annoyed me every time she wore it or when replicas of it ended up on the big bush outside of Lucinda and Rob's little house. Every single time I saw it, I wanted to jump through the screen and tell Lucinda to run for it and take Rob with her. Of course, though, that's exactly what the audience is supposed to feel about the hat and Auntie's presence (at least I felt that way)Another thing is when Rob and Drosophila are at the church and Lucinda is being comforted by Mrs. Jackson in the woods. I wanted to know what prompted Auntie's change of heart towards Lucinda. I mean, Lucinda really dug a hole around herself by giving up her ring for the cows. But that's where the title comes into play, The Price Of Milk. It couldn't very well be The Price of Love The audience can feel her desperation for being so foolish by playing with her love for Rob.New Zealand appears to be a great place to film movies, not just this one but also LOTR trilogy and many others. So many different extremes in a small country. It's amazing what types of climates and differences in land you can utilize.

Yep its a fairy tale for sure and at least tons better than Spielberg's version of War of the Worlds. Nice to see an original storyline instead of all these super budgeted remakes, ugh! Enough already. Be interesting to know how much was actually spent on this production. I think there will be a gradual shift away from big budget films in the future, with ones that have a simple plot line, yet still be entertaining.

The chemistry between Karl Urban and Danelle Cormack was beautiful. Visually it was captivating. The characters were entertaining, engaging, and memorable. I especially loved the dog suffering from agoraphobia and the mysterious Jacksons. Some people may find it hard to follow what is going on as people appear and disappear, and they not understand some for the random things in the movie such as a bath tub in the middle of a field. the all of the quirks and the random moments give this movie an emotionally full filling and magical feel. At the end I was left with a smile and a full heart.

The Price of Milk is, along with The Irrefutable Truth about Demons an introduction to the new cinema from outside the great markets (or should I say market?). This movie is a modern fairy-tale that tells the strange love story of two normal persons that almost lose their mental sanity while trying not to lose their love (and their cows and the blanket). It's a hard movie, not very easy to understand for normal people, but very appreciated by the critics. I recommended this movie to almost everybody I knew that know how to appreciate a movie. And I also recommend it to all of you. And get ready... Peter Jackson and Karl Urban will be back in Lord of the Rings!

I am at a loss to explain this.Avoid this movie at all costs. You have only a certain number of hours on the Earth, don't waste 1&1/2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of Guano!!!There is no story as apparently the director wrote (and I'm guessing with a blunt orange crayon) the next day's script at the completion of the day's shooting. The story has been called whimsical, no it is aimless, there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial. Don't you hate ads?Now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here. And similarly the writer/director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work Toy Love So to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you're paid to watch it avoid it.To paraphrase Monty Python's Search for the holy Grail, Run flee!

What is it with New Zeland that brings us these amazing films? In this film, a young couple lives a beautiful love, magical, until the day she doubts his love and tries everything to test it. Finally there's no more magic.. love's dead. And then we are trapped inside the film, we want to be there and help her, them, restoring their love.. Too beautiful!

In fact, we've made a saying among our friends when something is horrible it's Price of Milk bad","Date":"15 December 2010","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" This has to be the worst movie in history. This was my first indie film so it turned me off to the genre for a long time. I've since watched other indie films and learned that by and large this one just happened to suck.It started out interesting... in fact, it brought up the cute topic of some women that begin collecting baby clothes for one day... however, at almost the halfway mark the movie took a turn towards nightmare-ville when she rolled her car yet again. It seemed like the first part of the movie was made by a gifted writer and the last half was written by my son Alex (who can't read or write yet). If you are contemplating suicide, don't watch this movie as it will more than likely push you over the edge.

This movie is not entirely devoid of worthwhile moments, and the cast is quite appealing. However, the quirkiness of the story eventually feels forced, and I lost interest in the movie well before it was over.

The atmosphere of the film is ridiculous, which would be fine, if the characters weren't suffering from broken-hearts (which is not made funny), just annoying interruptions into what could've been a really successful comedy. One minute I'd want to laugh then I'd be staring at a sour-faced, miserable farmer who had lost his entire livelihood and was sleeping on the back of his Ute, and being tricked away from his soul-mate. This might have been sad if it weren't for the entire absurdity of the situation, for example, his girlfriend sold 117 cows for a patchwork quilt, his dog runs around under cover of a box, one of the walls of his house sometimes collapses and has to be propped up, and he is about to marry a woman named after a fly.

It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. I don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful. The only scene I didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film. How do people get finance for this stuff? I don't mind alternative films but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure? I would call 'Price of Milk' amateurish if it wasn't an insult to amateurs. This would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged!

I thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the dairy barn any minute.  So I cheated, grabbed the remote, and was relieved to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes.  I should have turned the channel. Cute, it had potential, but yuck!   "}{"Title":"Mooo!","Date":"26 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  The Price of Milk is a wandering and peculiar romantic fairy tale of sorts involving one man, one woman, a bunch of indigenous New Zelanders, an agoraphobic dog, some milk cows, and some very strange goings on. The film has the feel of a low budget indie with a meager story about the romantic vicissitudes of a young couple who bath themselves and wash their dishes in an outdoor bathtub (at the same time) among other quirky and nonsensical behavioral things. There is so little substance to be found in TPofM that were it not for the magical/fantasy stuff, the film wouldn't be worth watching at all. With the magical/fantasy stuff, it's a marginal watch at best and then only for those who can buy into such nonsense.Note - I don't really know what the hell this film was supposed to be about save the obvious and cannot exclude the possibility that there was (though I doubt it) some profound meaning which just didn't show up on my radar screen.
