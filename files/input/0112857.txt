[{"Title":"Highly regarded, but it's filled with empty nostalgia and clichés galore","Date":"2 July 2014","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)I wanted to like this movie. A good friend pressed it forward as a belated view of the black noir experience, and there was such truth that the urban black world hadn't seen any attention in the classic noir days (post-War) I had to watch it.But this is more belated than anything. It's loaded with clichés without really moving them anywhere new (and a stale cliché is really deadening). The director AND screenwriter, Carl Franklin, is relatively untested&#x97;he's done a bunch of t.v. stuff, an African-American with talent as an a actor but a little stretched here, I think. The star does his best to hold it together, none other than Denzel Washington, but in fact even he is following old patterns a bit listlessly. This is really clear when a truly brilliant actor arrives on the scene&#x97;Don Cheadle&#x97;and in his moments there is finally a rising up and synthesis of intentions.The plot is almost a given&#x97;a detective on the outs faces a terrible crime, and a mysterious woman (call her a femme fatale if you want, but she's too plastic to work for me). He is hounded by a white man (or two) with truly dubious or evil intentions that he can't quite decipher. Until it really gets out of his control. The book is here is by the much lauded author Walter Mosley, and I only discovered this today (I saw them movie innocently). And I've read one or two things by Mosley and actually found the same problem as the movie lots of tropes and worn out problems approached in the same old way. Except with black characters.Now this may be naive, but I think in fact the world of urban Blacks and their crime worlds in mid-Century America is really really ripe for some serious fictional writing. Something without myth making. There must be a black Bogart or Mitchum type out there for those inclined. There's another problem, though, looking back and wishing we had better movies about certain things than we did. Maybe that's just the way it was, and we need new movies about new things, not re-hashed themes that only half make up for what might have been. Or not. We weren't there, and we never can be.So all good intentions aside, give this movie a skeptical look. It's well enough made and has some tightly made moments, but as a whole it flounders and lacks one of the basics&#x97;originality.

Cheadle is terrific as the sociopathic Mouse, his scenes are the best in the movie and his twenty minutes or so of screen time make the entire thing worthwhile. Unfortunately, Beals is not up to the job as the enigmatic girlfriend of a mayoral candidate. She plays every scene as if she were reading lines and puttying her face.I liked the odd touches, such as the weird gardener who keeps trying to cut down everyone's trees. But I didn't like the evolution of Washington's character. Washington plays him with such subtle and fragile humanity that his transformation at the end is just unbelievable.

This type of plot may be very familiar but it's also utterly irresistible. What makes it so compelling is that it's the type of predicament that most people can immediately relate to and as a consequence soon find themselves empathising with the hapless protagonist. In Devil In A Blue Dress the audience's inclination to respond in this way is made even stronger by the use of a narration which also helps to drive the story forward.In 1948 L.A. World War 11 veteran, ex-factory worker and homeowner Ezekiel Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington) finds himself unemployed and in urgent need of funds to keep his mortgage payments up to date. Easy's efforts to find a job have, so far, drawn a blank and the longer his predicament continues, the more desperate his need for work becomes. Knowing of his plight, one of his friends introduces him to DeWitt Albright (Tom Sizemore) who claims that he's a man who does favours for friends. Albright offers Easy $100 to find a mysterious woman called Daphne Monet (Jennifer Beals) who was the fiancée of a mayoral candidate who'd withdrawn from the race when she'd disappeared.Easy is instinctively suspicious of Albright but can't afford to turn down the money on offer. He takes the job and soon finds that his misgivings were well founded as his investigations lead to him being suspected of two murders, being beaten by the police and also threatened by Albright's henchmen as well as Monet's half brother.It later emerges that Daphne's association with her gangster half brother and her mixed racial heritage had derailed both her relationship with her fiancé and also his political ambitions. His opponent's candidature would also be brought to an abrupt end, however, if his own personal depravity and its connection with the two murders were to be exposed. Through his efforts to complete his investigations, Easy gets well rewarded financially but also gets involved in some more life threatening violence.Devil In A Blue Dress is a Raymond Chandler influenced thriller with a typically complicated plot about blackmail, murder, immorality and corruption which also features numerous moments of unexpected humour. Its recreation of the period in which the action is set looks really authentic and the choice of colours used reinforces this impression. The atmosphere of the time is also enhanced powerfully by the superb soundtrack.Devil In A Blue Dress depicts a time in which racial segregation was a part of everyday life and the dangers of crossing the lines were very real. DeWitt Albright was a white man who avoided crossing the line by hiring Easy to undertake an investigation which needed to be carried out predominantly in the black community. Daphne Monet's romance was blighted by racism and Easy's discomfort in situations where he had to cross the line was also very clear.This movie features a fascinating bunch of characters and the choice of Denzel Washington for the lead role is perfect as he personifies so well the down to earth nature of a decent man who has to deal with difficult circumstances. The entire cast give very creditable performances but Don Cheadle's portrayal of Easy's gun happy psycho friend from Huston is a real standout.

It stars Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, Don Cheadle and Maury Chaykin. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.Carl Franklin had already laid down a considerable neo-noir marker with his searing 1992 thriller One False Move, here he goes more traditional but garners equally impressive results. Plot has Washington as a WW2 veteran who has lost his job and desperately needs money to keep hold of his pride and joy - his house. Taking on a job offered by shifty DeWitt Albright (Sizemore), to find a missing woman, Rawlings quickly finds himself in up to his neck in murder and deception, he must turn ace detective to save his skin.Set in late 1940s Los Angeles, what instantly stands out is the period detail. The clothes, the cars and the establishments frequented by Easy and company. With voice over narration also provided by Washington, in dry and sardonic tones, it's every inch a loving ode to the film noir movies released at the time the pic is set. There's plenty of neon signs about the place, some bad ass cops, good sex, brandy and sharp suits, smoking and coolness and of course a psychopath in the classic mould (Cheadle excellent).But of course noir dressage is only that if you haven't got a good pot boiling plot, thankfully this has one. The story takes unexpected turns, always remaining interesting, the distinctive characterisations breathing heavy, managing to off set the run of the mill stereotypes in the supporting ranks. It can be argued that Beals as the titular femme fatale of the title is under written, but the character comes with an air of mystery that serves Franklin's atmosphere very well. Tech credits are high, something of a given with Bernstein and Fujimoto on the list, while Washington turns in another classy show of subtlety and believability.Lovers of film noir should get much rewards from Devil in a Blue Dress. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"A murder mystery in the style of the old Film Noir","Date":"25 December 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" From the shorts to this movie I thought that it was about a Negro in the Southern United States who had been framed for the murder of a white girl and had to prove his innocence against a huge amount of discrimination. This movie is nothing of the sort. Rather it is set in Los Angeles in 1948. America faces a boom time economy, the war is over and the good times are everywhere. It is still a decade before the civil rights movement begins so Negroes are still treated as second class citizens. Everybody has a job and everybody is happy, all except a Negro named Ezekial (Denzel Washington). He is single and a World War II veteran. He moved to Los Angeles from Texas and has bought himself a house in the expanding suburbs in what will probably become South Central Los Angeles in the 1990's. He worked overtime and because of that was fired and now he is looking for a job. A friend who owns a bar hooks him up with somebody who wants a young lady found. This lady was the girlfriend of a rich Los Angeles businessman who is running for mayor and he wants her.What this movie turns out to be is a detective story. It seems to be a revisitation of the old 1940's and 1950's detective films such as the Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon. The major difference is that this is not as dark as these other movies. Devil in a Blue Dress does portray a rather darker side to this era though. The 50's is generally considered to be a time when everything was good and politicians could be trusted. Movies such as this and L.A. Confidential appear and undermine the glamour of this era. In this movie we see corrupt politicians, racist cops, infidelity, child molestation. and severe segregation.There are a number of small themes in this movie, though the major one seems to be the removal of the façade that the 50's erected around itself. Ezekial was the subject of racist rebuke when the police try to pin the murder of a white man on him, and there is the issue of him being sacked for working overtime while a white man who does that is rewarded. Devil in a Blue Dress takes the 50's and destroys its credibility. It shows a suburb that one day will become a crime ridden slum. It can't be helped seeing South Central Los Angeles in this suburban paradise in the 50's. Such things are portrayed in other movies to, such as Back to the Future where the dream suburb becomes a haven of crime in the future.This is a movie that does not create the façade of a great America that has reached the pinnacle of civilisation. Rather it creates an America that is showing signs of decay even in its finest hour.

All the elements of a good origin story for a movie franchise or a television adaptation (like MASH) are there a compelling main character (Easy Rawlings) a setup for further adventures and the books of Walter Mosley for plot ideas. Also race, which is an essential element to the story of 1948 Los Angeles, continues to be a compelling social topic. Certainly some inherent challenges may have dogged efforts to bring the stories to the big or small screen. Period dramas, particularly those that necessitate car chases through long gone parts of Los Angeles, are expensive and difficult to stage and film. Also, the deus ex machina character of Mouse played by Don Cheadle presents some serious moral problems with his twitchiest of hair triggers. Also some of the attempts of dark humor focused mainly around Mouse in a serious noir are jarring and out of context with such dark material. As a standalone film, Devil in a Blue Dress-presumably not originally based on the Mitch Ryder song-garners a lot of unproven claims of being underrated from internet and mainstream commentators. Certainly, the movie entertains as Rawlings unravels a mystery involving murder, politics and Jennifer Beals in an early role against a backdrop of racial inequity in America's golden west. However, all of these elements are employed to far more compelling effect in a movie two years later called L.A. Confidential. In short, fans of noir or Washington / Cheadle should find this as required reading while others should just go with L.A. Confidential.

Combined with director Franklin's dexterous dolly movements and smooth camera techniques that follow the always-charismatic Denzel Washington around the culturally diverse streets of 1948 Los Angeles, it makes you want to throw your imagination into its storyline for a few hours. With brooding and insidious male characters, beautiful and mysterious female characters, voiceover narration by the protagonist, and a gradually revelatory, detective-like storyline we get the sense that we're watching a more-colorful-than-usual film noir. There's no question that it couldn't have been setup much better; it's too bad that it slowly-but-surely dissipates away into the realm of conventionality.As far as underrated acting goes - Tom Sizemore is spectacularly sleazy as the coldhearted DeWitt Albright and Maury Chaykin is his usually creepy self as the political pedophiliac Matthew Terell. Easy Rawlins (Washington) is a familiar character - he's a man who will do just about whatever he has to do in order to earn some cash, although he's proud of his dignity and won't sell himself short. He's also more amiable and compassionate than the average man is, which is what ultimately differentiates him from the bad guys of the story. The lesser-seen element here, however, is that he also happens to be Afro-American. It's refreshing to see a film concentrate upon this culture without trying to dictate too many things to us about it - race is an element of this film, but it's not a particularly prominent or overblown one.A myriad of different characters are introduced - sometimes it seems as if the film is actually relying upon the appearances of new characters in order to progress the plot, and even then some things aren't made very clear. I understand that the writers were simply trying to convey the sheer volume of the situation that Easy has gotten himself into, but its lack of tautness just gets annoying after a while. And there is a cool aura of mystery surrounding the plot until you realize that it's simply going down the all-too-familiar cinematic road of political corruption. The final theme of an average man achieving complacency through oppression is well communicated, but couldn't it have been done in a slightly more interesting/original/unique way?

Denzel Washington is in the lead as a jobless ex-GI in 1947 Los Angeles who is hired by a stranger to find a white girl named Daphne. He does a good job, as usual, without being in the least extravagant. The supporting players are all equally good, with Don Cheadle in the flashiest role as a friendly killer.Jennifer Beals as the mysterious and missing devil in the blue dress is competent and attractive. You have never seen such huge, glistening black eyes. Why hasn't she gotten better parts? Location shooting is done carefully too. Lots of nice shots of seedier locations as well as a couple of the kind of faux country estates we saw so often on Columbo. Washington, of course, is African-American, and Beals is passable as a Creole from Louisiana. Relationships between the police and the black community are sketched out in what's probably realistic detail. The heavy handedness of the cops should come as no surprise to anyone who's seen L.A. Confidential, although it may shock some who grew up on Dragnet. The racial divide isn't imposed willy nilly on the script, either. This is an unashamed noir. There's no attempt to make racism the central issue. It may be difficult for some of us to accept the notion that a politician's marriage to a woman who is partly of black parentage would stultify his career but it was true enough.Still, the movie fails to engage. The narrative is murky, the action turgid, and there is a narration by Washington that serves as a familiar crutch for a weak story. It does nothing more than fill us in on the details of Washington's peregrinations, without adding anything more. It's Raymond Chandler without the fustian poetry or the scintillating cynicism. Washington's voice over never tells us that some babe had hair the color of gold in old paintings. It only tells us things like, I figured I'd better get out of there. I didn't really care much about anyone but Washington's out-of-work nice guy. I wanted him to make enough money to pay off his mortgage. That was about it. Well -- of course I didn't want to see Jennifer Beals tortured with that red hot poker either, although I wouldn't have minded if her captors had torn her clothes a little. Or, I guess the script could even have let her take a long, languorous bath.Chandler and Hammett never had especially gripping characters either but Chandler carried us along with his blunt, boozy charm, and Hammett bootlegged in a philosophy of life.Speaking of carried, Washington has a line he speaks to Beals. Change out of that house coat. Come on, I'll carry you home. Washington doesn't mean he's going to sweep her up in his arms and schlep her across town. He means he's going to escort her home in his vehicle. This is an old-fashioned, mostly Southern usage. It dates back to before the Civil War, as in Carry Me Back to Old Virginny. I didn't mean to carry on so, but that sentence was one of the few things in the movie that roused my attention.

Hidden machinations that involve people in high places, a set of incriminating photos with a mayoral election in the balance.

Ezekiel Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington) returned from World War II a few years ago to a land of opportunity. He got a job, a mortgage and a home of his own. But now he has lost his job and is determined not to lose his house. A friend introduces Easy to a sleazy character named DeWitt Albright (Tom Sizemore) who ostensibly is trying to locate the former girlfriend of mayoral candidate Tom Carter (Terry Kinney) so that the couple may be reunited. Desperate to keep making his mortgage payments, Easy accepts the job of finding the girlfriend, a woman named Daphne Monet (Jennifer Beals). His search causes him to be suspect in several murders and arouses the interest of the rival candidate for mayor, Matthew Teran (Maury Chaykin). Easy finds that he is not the only person looking for Daphne Monet and that no one is exactly who he, or she, appears to be. There's strong acting by all the members of the cast. Washington brings his typical integrity and likability to Easy, and Don Cheadle almost steals the show. Mouse is quick to kill, basically a psycho, but a great friend to have. Also noteworthy is Tom Sizemore as a ruthless, cold-blooded bad guy and Jennifer Beals is alluring as the mysterious Daphne Monet. Regardless, this is a fascinating movie that just oozes with the 1940's atmosphere. Great narration in there, a la film noir, great automobiles and great sets.

This is a wonderful little Private Eye story about on the level of LADY IN THE LAKE with Robert Montgomery, but Easy Rawlins is here to ferret out the clues from a Black perspective. He does not come to the world of private investigation willingly, but rather has it thrust upon him due to circumstances of unemployment. He is sitting in the bar of his friend Joppy, searching through the want ads when he finds out there is a white man with a job for him.He asks none of the questions he might have with a mortgage to pay on a new house and sundry other expenses. He is simply scuffling to assimilate into the newly emerging Black Middle Class in Los Angeles. Therefore he agrees to meet with a Dewitt Albright, and agrees to search for and find a white woman who has retreated into obscurity within the Black Community. He takes his initial payment and prepares to set to work to locate Daphne Monet. The task on the face of it sounds, well, 'easy', but this is just the beginning of the story...Pretty Boy Rawlins begins to scout around and has his questions answered with questions by an associate and friend of Daphne named Coretta James. Sooner than later, Coretta winds up a stiff and Rawlins finds himself swirling to the bottom of a whole lot of trouble...Denzel Washington is spot on as Easy Rawlings, who simply wants to settle down into a middle class life with the rest of the World War II veterans, but finds his true calling as a Private Investigator. Don Cheadle nearly steals the whole show as Miles Alexander, (originally 'Mouse' in the novel) and comes across as a community icon or archetype. Most Black People will tell you every neighborhood has its 'Mouse' or 'Miles' Alexander. The little guy with a heart of gold, but who you would not leave an alley fight with alive. Don Cheadle channels this personality so well, that it is only Denzel Washington's exceptional acting ability that keeps him from being the Green Hornet to Cheadle's version of Kato.Jennifer Beals is suitably elegant and wonderful as Daphne Monet, but I could not help thinking what it would have been like to have Cassidy Rae, Julia Styles or Ali Larter play Ms. Monet, as these actresses more physically resemble the character in the novel. But she works so well in the ensemble that this is just a moot point. There is also a love scene in the novel that was left out of the film, but I suppose Easy Rawlins can't hit all the spots in Los Angeles.Like the MALTESE FALCON, the film version of DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS is actually an improvement upon the novel, and some of the reviewers here and many people in my neck of the woods would heartily welcome the further adventures of Easy Rawlins on film. This DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS could have been the DOCTOR NO to a whole series of adventures, but that was over twenty years ago now. This could have been suggested at the end of this film simply by having Easy pick up a ringing phone to hear a voice at the other end requesting his help.But there is no time like the present and it's never too late for new adventures.

And Easy Rawlins is out of a job. having been fired by Champion Aircraft Easy is willing to do anything to pay his Mortgage. When Easy is offered a job by a white man named Dewitt Albright. The Job seems simple enough. Locate a white woman named Daphne Monet a white woman who loves the Negro jazz clubs and Negro company. Since Easy is a black man he can move around in that community. Seems simple enough but there are lies half truths betrayals and murder before its all over and Easy will be right in the middle of it. With the cops on the left wanting him. And Gangsters and corrupt politics on the right all wanting Easy dead. Easy must find a way to clear his name and to protect himself when the devil comes calling.The Movie is almost faithful to the book. And its a wonderful time If you're into Chandler like storytelling. Easy Rawlins is a worthy successor to Phillip Marlowe. both are world weary knights with a code of honor. As the movie shows Easy is a man with his own code. He's loyal to his friends and he's willing to do what it takes to get the job done.. Carl Franklin carefully crafts this adaptation into a suspenseful film noir And Denzel Washington shows us why he is the only choice to play Easy Rawlins . A look back at the good old days when they were not always good. and the future wasn't always certain.

The cars all seemed to be the same. So did many of the outfits the characters were wearing. Finally, they seemed to both share the types of tools; guns, gadgets, etc. Of course this character was alike to that of Jack Gittes in Chinatown. The biggest comparison being they are both detectives who get caught up in a more serious crime dilemma than what was originally expected. Also, they are both on the search for the dame in distress, who turns out to be a very provocative and compelling character. The movies are also the same in the way they are through the narration of the main character. Also, they both tend to get beat up by some hired goons! Devil in a New Dress had a mixed drama to it. It used tomes of a typical thriller we would see in today's films. There was not as much down time as there was in Chinatown. So even though this movie set in the past and had a lot of characters who fit that part, it still had a new movie feel to it Yes, I do believe the story changes because the main character is black. For this movie they tried to show a lot of the darker elements behind racism towards blacks for that time period. It did not take away from the story, but at times it did feel forced. It felt like it was an adversity that he never truly climbed away from. This is the opposite for the movie Chinatown. It mainly focused on the racism towards Asians at that time period, but was less subtly. Such as; the differences in the way they pronounce words. The films would be greatly different if they were set in the present day. I would not get that special feel if it was not taken place in the 40's. Plus I cannot picture a detective, in this day in age, doing the things Jack Gittes and Easy Rawlins. Especially going after a dame in distress.

He is eventually forced to either solve a murder mystery or to become the fall guy for a series of crimes. Easy enlists the aid of a shady character from his past life nicknamed Mouse.

Tom Sizemore does a pretty good job as well as Dewitt Albright. He is a creep without being overbearing. Don Cheadle does a pretty good job as Mouse, Easy's crazy but loyal friend. Like I said the movie is 85% loyal to the book so there are a few things the movie changed around(like the way Albright really died) and a few things left out(like the numerous love scenes with Easy and Daphne).

However, it keeps you watching, interested in how Washington is going to solve the case while trying to protect himself from attacks on all sides (including an eccentric and/or mentally challenged neighbor insistent on uprooting trees).

As his last name suggests, Mouse is black America's Alex -- only far more disturbing and more self-aware. He is not only a stone killer. He's a fascinating commentary on the very nature of racial oppression --in a society which lynches and dehumanizes black men at every turn, only the black psychopath is truly free. Great credit must be given to actor Don Cheadle for fully realizing this frightening yet strangely compelling character. Cheadle holds nothing back, explores each nuance of Mouse's personality -- the eerie calm, the moments of laughter, the unpredictable rages and supreme self confidence of a black man who simply does not fear white men or death.  Though Mouse is a grim character, his personality is one of great humor and he is both a terrifying villain and very effective comic relief.Denzel Washington plays Easy Rawlins, the main character. But he does nothing with Easy. Nothing at all. The movie would have been much better had Mouse shot Easy, grabbed luscious Daphne Manet, and run off with all the money. Or failing that, Mouse could have died in a shoot out with the cops, gunning them down while laughing demonically, like a black Davy Crockett at the Alamo. And perhaps Easy and Daphne could have gotten away in the background. As it is, though, the movie is so lackluster and dull that few people will ever see the spectacular work Don Cheadle does as Mouse. And that's a real shame.
