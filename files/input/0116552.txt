This one is probably slightly funnier, with another good adventure and almost as much proof as the last one that dogs really are man's best friend.However, this sequel has its flaws, as in things about the film that don't completely make sense if you have watched the first film. For example, in the first film Chance learnt how to be a faithful and kind dog to Jamie, but in this it seem's he's even sillier. Another one of these flaws is that he explains in the first film that he lived on the streets and now Shadow is talking about how he can't live on the streets and he doesn't know how to. WHAT!? Otherwise, an incredibly good sequel, with romance, adventure and charm, but just doesn't have the emotion that made the original film so special and captivating.Chance's, Sassy's and Shadow's owners are going on a camping trip and taking the dogs with them. However, Chance, like in the last film, becomes incredibly confused with the situation and escapes out of his dog box before all three of them are loaded onto the plane. That means they are lost in San Francisco, while the humans go off without them! What can they do?Recommended to people who liked the first film, people who were disappointed that there was no romance in the first film and just people who like dogs!Enjoy Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco!

She thought the sequel was very funny, particularly some of Sassy the Cat's antics. I must admit, the movie took me in as well.The sequel is a little heavier-handed than the 1993 remake. Not only do our three main characters have to get home, but they have to defeat a gang of city dogs, outwit two dognappers who are trying to sell strays to the The Lab, rescue a child from a burning building, and find true love on top of it all!Still, not a bad way to spend 89 minutes. Michael J. Fox is again excellent as Chance, Sally Fields is full of indignation as Sassy, and Ralph Waite does an eerily accurate recreation of the late Don Ameche's characterization of Shadow. Sinbad is wasted as Reilly, their new city dog friend. The character seemed to be more of an afterthought than anything.Most pleasant surprise Al Michaels, Tommy Lasorda and Bob Uecker as three dogs broadcasting a pee-wee baseball game. If you are looking for a movie to enjoy with your children without feeling totally insulted, Homeward Bound II is a solid bet. A few tense moments, but nothing that should upset anyone beyond the Teletubbies set.

But what does compensate hugely is the witty script(of which Sassy gets the majority of the best lines), the lovely soundtrack and the voice acting. Michael J Fox and Sally Field once again do fine work, and while the late Don Ameche was a lot more noble and gentle, Ralph Waite does an above average job as the voice of Shadow the Golden Retriever. The animals also did wonderfully and came very close to stealing the show, and the camera-work is often excellent.

But I can't say the same about its sequel.Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco is not a bad film. For a sequel, it's not all that bad. It is still entertaining enough and features the same main cast (except Don Ameche, who passed away in 1993). But the movie just can't reach the greatness of the first one, so the fact that it is disappointing comes to me as no surprise. This movie simply doesn't follow the spirit of the original neither the spirit of others like it.The plot is somewhat similar to the first one's. However, instead of the Sierra mountains, this one takes our 3 pet friends to the urban life, more precisely to the worst streets of San Francisco. Basically it focus more on desert roads, empty streets and dirty alleys. We don't see that much of San Francisco, neither of its most beautiful things. This is a radical contrast with the first movie's environment, which shows us all the beauty of pure nature in the Sierra mountains.In this film, our buddies Shadow, Chance and Sassy often face city's dangers, such as weird people, two dog catchers who lock street dogs in their van to take them to one of those creepy laboratories and two rival dogs a vicious boxer-like dog and a goofy bulldog-like dog, despite the help of numerous street dogs (Riley and his gang).The two rival dogs are particularly annoying, especially the boxer-like dog. Most of the street dogs here are annoying either, except for Delilah (a beautiful Kuvasz) and Riley. As for the dog catchers, the driver isn't that annoying, but his partner is. On the other hand, the cute little boy Tucker was adorable and his cute kitten Tiger too.The movie isn't nostalgic, emotional or charming like the first one. While it has some funny gags, it isn't humor as pleasant as in the first one. The soundtrack isn't as good as in the first one, although this one still has some good music.One of the few really good things in this movie is the Golden Gate Bridge (the enormous bridge in San Franciso), a construction that always fascinated me.

It seemed like a great concept and go back to the magic of the first one. While it's not as good as the first one, I warn you, I think this was still a fine family film.The family is going on vacation again, but this time they are taking the pets with.

So, Chance escapes the cage taking him to the plane, Shadow and Sassy follow to help Chance. They end up lost in San Francisco and get their butts saved by other street dogs, Chance also falls for one of those dogs named Delila. But it's street vs. pet and if humans are really worth risking everything for.Like I said, the second Homeward Bound doesn't compare to the original and the plot is extremely similar, but I think over all that it worked very well for the kids. The whole family will enjoy the film, it has positive energy and fun jokes that anyone could enjoy if they don't have an attitude problem.

On the bright side they can always use their superior films to focus attention and try to forget they were ever in this shat stain family film.

Also, we have a similar theme as in the first Homeward Bound with animals lost and having to find their way home. This sequel is not as good as the original. It dwells a little too much on the romance between the two dogs, and it doesn't show enough interesting scenes in San Francisco, which you would really expect from the title of the film alone. The animals stayed too long in one spot and should have been on the move more.Otherwise, Michael J. Fox and Sally Field once again have a ton of gag lines to speak as the dog and cat, respectively.

Much of it would consist of two dogs or a dog and a cat staring disinterestedly at each other for half-a-minute at a time. With sound it's a little more entertaining, although in this age of computer games it would probably struggle to keep even younger kids entertained for long. The story is essentially a remake of the original with the action transplanted to the city of San Francisco. Our heroes go through a number of mildly diverting adventures before making their way home. There's a pair of dastardly dog catchers &#x96; has, I wonder, any film been made in the history of cinema that featured a non-dastardly dog-catcher? I don't know, perhaps in a country where rabies is rife. The dog-catchers give the kids someone to hiss at, but there's nothing particularly threatening about them. Each of the animals involved has a voice, although this being the olden days of the mid-1990s, the cheap technology required to give the illusion that their mouths are actually moving obviously didn't exist, so we have to assume all animals are telepathic, I suppose. The voices, other than Ralph Waite as the older dog, don't really suit. Had I been in charge of the voices I'd have given each the voice of a famous old movie star. It would have kept me entertained.

In my review of that film, I talked about my experience seeing most of it probably not long after its video release in 1993. Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco must have been new (or fairly new) to the VHS format when I saw it for the first time in 1996. I was around ten years old when that happened, and can't remember much from my first viewing, but I do remember liking the film. After finally watching its predecessor from start to finish earlier this week, leaving me with mixed feelings, I watched this 1996 sequel for the first time in nearly fourteen years, and this time, I basically thought it was average.Chance, Shadow, and Sassy are still living with the same family, but the troublemaking Chance isn't sure if his young owner, Jamie Seaver, wants him around anymore. The family decides to go on a trip to Canada and take the pets with them. However, at the airport in San Francisco, when the three animals are in carriers about to be put in the cargo hold of the plane, Chance panics and the three of them escape! The plane takes of with the humans on board, who don't know that they are leaving their pets behind. The naïve young Bulldog, wise old Golden Retriever, and arrogant Himalayan cat find themselves lost again, this time not in the wilderness, but on the streets of San Francisco! While walking through the city, they meet many stray dogs, some good and some bad, and Chance even falls in love with one of the good ones, a Kuvasz named Delilah. The animals have to try and stay away from two cruel dogcatchers who drive around in search of dogs to capture and take to a laboratory! One thing that is meant for laughs in the first Homeward Bound film is the rivalry between Chance and Sassy, which continues here, and unfortunately, it's not that funny in either film. I once again didn't usually find either of these two characters funny, and was once again not that impressed with the voice-overs provided by Michael J. Fox and Sally Field. Just like in the first film, the humour in this sequel rarely works. There were times when I smiled, and I couldn't help but laugh a little when Chance runs off with a baseball player's catcher's mitt near the beginning, but this was not enough, and most of the dogs introduced in this sequel don't tend to help much. When I recently watched Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey, I found that it was dull for a while but then improved when the big adventure began. However, while watching this sequel, I found that it basically continued to be dull when the adventure began, and stayed this way for most of the film. The adventure of the three pets here takes place in a very different setting, and we don't get the nice scenery. There is SOME suspense here, especially towards the end, but definitely less than there is in the 1993 release. I almost forgot to mention that the dog romance here also wasn't done do well, and it's something the original Homeward Bound doesn't have.Since I only found Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey to be barely above average when I saw it this month, I may not have ended up watching this unsurprisingly inferior sequel if I had never seen it before, but since I had previously seen Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco and remembered thinking it was good (better than the original at the time), I intended to watch it again and review it. Well, some movies one enjoys in their childhood can still be entertaining in adulthood, and some of them can't, and for me, this is one of the latter. I first watched it around the same time I first watched Jumanji, and I've seen that film again twice in the past few years and it hasn't disappointed me, but that didn't turn out to be the case with this Homeward Bound sequel. It seems to be considerably less popular than its predecessor, as sequels often are, and even though I'm certainly not as big a fan of the 1993 film as many clearly are, I think I can understand why, at least somewhat. If they were to make another Homeward Bound movie, I highly doubt I would bother watching it.

This is still, like the first Homeward Bound, a very strong and fun film for the entire family.Here is the plot of this movie. Our favorite talking animals Shadow, Chance, and Sassy are back after their adventure. It has been three years since their first incredible journey and some things have changed. Jamie, who is Chance's owner, does not play with him as much as he used to. Then the family decides to go to Canada with the animals. Fearing that he is going to the pound, Chance gets off the plane, with Shadow and Sassy, and they have to roam the streets of San Fransico. On the streets they encounter dog-fights, dog gangs, and illegal animal control. With the help of other dogs they defeat the animal control, and Chance falls in love with a dog named Deliliah. In the end the animals are saved by their family, and Deliliah becomes part of it.Overall, this is a good family sequel to a great family movie. It can not top the original, and some moments are corny, but this is a fun and exciting sequel. There are also some emotional scenes, like Chance getting trapped under a truck and the family does not know if he survived until Jamie checks and discovers he is all right. It is just too bad that Don Ameche died before he could reprise his role as Shadow, but Ralph Waite does a good impression of him.

They still live with the Seaver family who is taking a trip to Canada, but this time the pets come too. Chance bungles Jamie's soccer game and he becomes unhappy with him. Jamie has grown in these past three years! The family is now located in San Fransisco. Soon, they head to the airport and the pets are put into crates. Chance was afraid so he broke out and lead Shadow and Sassy out of the airport while the family's plane took off into the sky.     Sassy, Shadow and Chance walked along the streets of San Fransisco, alone and bickering. The next day, they meet Ashcan, a tough neighborhood dog. They also meet a team of street dogs, lead by Riley. Riley's back story is quite sad, really. It all began one Christmas when Riley was a puppy. He was given as a present to a little boy who didn't even give him a glance, so Riley was thrown into the street. Now that's just tragic! That rotten kid! Back to the present, one of the dogs in Riley's gang was a female named Delilah and she and Chance just hit it off and walked off together. Up in Canada, the family discovers the pets are missing and once again try to search for him. Back in San Fransisco, the animals are on the run from The Blood-Red Van. What that was was a van the color of blood that two bumbling dog catchers drove. The dogs, who are color-blind, call it the Blood-Red Van; Shadow and Sassy act quick to save a little boy and his puppy from a raging fire; Pretty soon, Chance and Delilah are picked up by the dog catchers but it was Sassy to the rescue! The van was sunk into the ocean and the dog-catchers are chased away. Before long, the family is reunited with their pets and return home. They adopt Delilah so now everything was perfect--at least it was when Chance took pizza from the pizza guy.        Not half as good as the original! I was quite disappointed with this movie. Michael J. Fox returns as the voice of Chance and Sally Field returns as Sassy but sadly, Don Ameche passed away in 1993 so he couldn't do Shadow. Ralph Waite takes his place but I'm sure if Ameche had been alive, I'm sure he wouldn't have liked this movie as much. I'm also sure that Fox and Field only did this because they had nothing better to do, just like the people at Disney, they did this movie because they had nothing better to do. Sinbad is the voice of Riley, although I'm sure he too didn't have a full plate; but anyway, if you'd like something to occupy your kids to keep them from bugging you then I recommend Homeward Bound II Lost in San Fransisco and I hope to God there won't be a Homeward Bound III. I probably shouldn't have said that because I probably gave Disney ideas. But anyway, even fans of the original should skip this one, but kids will love it! Don Ameche was still the best Shadow.

The three main characters are well rounded, interesting, and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant (though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home).This however, is not.We're at a point where the family is preparing to go camping in Canada, but after a paranoid Chance cocks things up by thinking he's being abandoned, the animals stupidly run away from the airport and find themselves down the back streets of San Francisco.The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly, dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays (one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson), team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again (even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out), and in general, the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, because as we all know, since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time, a city would be pretty small potatoes! We even fill the gap by having a bit where a kid is saved from a burning house! Any minute, I would expect Rin-Tin-Tin to come up with his attorney with a cease-and-desist note and threats of suing for copyright (and to be honest, I wouldn't blame him)! It is so bone-idle, that it in fact levers in a cheesy romance plot between Chance and a stray called Delilah! What were the writing team thinking when they cooked this up? My only conclusion They're all raving lunatics! We don't need a stupid romantic sub-plot levered into these films, it's totally superfluous! To make this story aggravatingly boneheaded, we even have a love rival by the way of another irritating redneck-drawling stray dog with the brains of a kipper! (For some reason, they use a Grand-Bleu De Gascogne for this, sadly a very rare dog, which would smack of doggie racism, unless it perhaps indicates that the writers hate the French and the rednecks.) I also wonder why Chance still behaves like a terminally-naive puppy despite his last experiences in the wilderness which would surely have taught him a thing or two! Not forgetting, in the first film, Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog, and was abandoned when still a puppy, so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think? The conclusion that wraps up the film's stories is cringe worthy to the point of wanting to put your foot through the telly! I won't reveal it, but if you look at the rest of the film, a climax of this film will not be worth the case it is carried in! Stick to Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. At least that way you can pretend that this Godawful mess never existed and enjoy the better original. Watching this sequel may result in you hurling yourself in front of a freight train! You have been warned! "},{"Title":"positive","Date":"14 November 2002","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  Do see this film!

This, David R. Ellis' first outing, is a pretty bland family movie which parents probably won't laugh out loud at, but won't find terrible either. Ellis is limited to kiddie stuff, has no Samuel L. Jackson on his side, and definitely no snakes, so what he's left to work with is a rather lackluster script in a movie whose target is to cash in on the original rather than expand on it. Still, the movie is alright for what it is, and with a name like Homeward Bound 2 Lost in San Fransisco, what did you expect?? The dogs are cute, the cat is cool, and although I personally would have enjoyed the movie more if the animals went insane aboard their owners' flight, it's a perfectly passable and inoffensive movie for the kids. Overall, Lost is an OK way to kill a few hours together with the wee ones. Just don't expect anything on the level of Snakes on a Plane.Warning Not recommended for teenagers. Corny jokes overload.

Ellis (Final Destination 2, Snakes on a Plane). Basically it's been three years since the previous events, the family are happily living in San Francisco heading for a vacation to Canada. Once again the pets somehow get left behind just after the plane takes off, so Shadow the dog (voiced by The Bodyguard's Ralph Waite, replacing Don Ameche), Chance the dog, (voiced by Michael J. Fox) and Sassy the cat (voiced by Sally Field) try to find their way back to their owners. Along the way they meet scruffy bully dogs, abandoned rebel dogs, some bumbling dog catchers in their Blood Red Van, and Chance even finds himself a girlfriend that could distract him completely. Eventually they make it out of the city in one piece, and hardly any danger or shenanigans, and back to their owners, with Chance's girlfriend not too far behind. Also starring Airplane's Robert Hays as Bob Seaver, Kim Greist as Laura Seaver, Veronica Lauren as Hope Seaver, Kristina Lewis as Stacy, Kevin Chevalia as Jamie Seaver, Adam Goldberg as Pete, Sinbad as Riley and Stephen Tobolowsky as Bando. The animals are still lovable and fun to watch, but the lack of adventurous moments makes it is pretty boring compared to the first one. Adequate!

It's a clone, only it's about our three friends on the streets of San Francisco instead of the wilderness. The new animal characters are just there to fill in time, and the love plot, to me, added nothing to the movie, but yet more time to fill in. Subtract all the fill-ins, and we have a movie of about 15 minutes in length.** out of ***** "}]
