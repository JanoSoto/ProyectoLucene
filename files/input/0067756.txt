I remembered a story with a slight environmental message, cute robots that talked and a totally sympathetic lead character played slightly woodenly by Bruce Dern.Seen again, the green message ISN'T subtle, the robots DON'T talk, and far from wholly sympathetic, Dern plays a man suffering a complete nervous breakdown. Not only that, but it has an incongruous, jarring soundtrack by Joan Baez.So, it was a different film to how I'd remembered, but perhaps someway the better. Dern is far from wooden, and gives the performance of a lifetime. Even though this performance was overlooked for an Oscar nomination, it is still remarkable that the film was made at all. Can you imagine pitching this film to a Hollywood exec of the 90's?There's this guy who's in his late thirties who looks after a forest in space. There's no love interest, instead the guy is  lonely, a little nerdy, socially inept, and kills all his friends in cold blood. The remainder of the film hangs not on tension but on whether or not his plants whither. Oh, and some robots help him out, but they might be psychotic, too.As a result, Silent Running is utterly unique, and even if not judged as the best sf film ever made, it is certainly one of the most important.

It doesn't contain action scenes every two seconds for the easily distracted.  It just rips your heart out, and makes you think long after the movie is over.  It is about isolation, alienation, lost causes, and the inevitable future.  In short, it is a genuine science fiction film, not a gunfight covered with techno-glitz and special effects calling itself science fiction.  Star Wars is great science fantasy, but the essence of science fiction is about what could happen, and is happening, and by the end of the film we have the disturbing feeling that it is a prediction of the future that will happen without intervention.The feelings of sadness and hope this film evokes are inextricably linked in this film, right up until the end.  If you rent this movie, you will be haunted by its images long after you have forgotten other films. Ten out of ten stars; from the writing, directing and acting, right down to the three robot drones (Huey, Dewey and Louie), there is nothing to fault with in this film.

By far the best to come out of this program was 'Silent Running', an ecologically-minded 'message film' that stands out today as one of the truly great films of the science-fiction genre.Bruce Dern stars as Freeman Lowell, a futuristic Park Ranger minding Earth's last forests, sealed in gigantic domes aboard an equally gigantic freighter in space. When ordered to destroy the domes and return home, Lowell is forced to choose between his crewmates and his beloved forests.The motif of a polluted, or simply, homogenized Earth, the ultimate triumph of human progress over nature and wilderness, is a standard theme of science fiction in the 20th century, and the film is not too different from many other films and episodic television programs seen since the postwar period. Rarely, however, has the theme been explored from the point of view of ecological ethics. The storyline is kept deliberately simple, and asks not the question 'How Would You Act In Such A Position', it merely shows how one particular man might. The characters are given seminal, yet subtle opportunities to flesh themselves out (comments made during meals and card games are particularly noteworthy), and even if the character of Lowell is ultimately dislikeable, he remains oddly sympathetic. Dern produces a remarkable performance here, as a tortured, perhaps even mentally-ill, loner. His work here is still fresh and understated and certainly not of the over-the-top calibre, despite the insistances of some.The film possesses truly amazing visual images, from the spacecraft itself (the decommissioned and soon-to-be-scrapped aircraft carrier Valley Forge) to the domes (an aircraft hanger at Van Nuys Airport) to the unforgettable Drones, uncanny little robots designed around the amputee-actors that give them life. Visual effects are excellent, the direct prototypes of even more fantastical films to come. The music, composed for the film by Peter Schickele (known internationally as P.D.Q. Bach), is by turns boldly triumphant, softly mournful, and is quite effective; some viewers may hate the vocal work of Joan Baez, but she is a logical choice for this production and time period.While many films have suffered since the release of 'Star Wars'(which is NOT, strictly speaking, science-fiction) due to dated visuals and obsolete effects technology, 'Silent Running' is still startlingly clean and visionary. A worthy film for all science-fiction fans to see.

Oh, it has special effects all right, and I think they're good enough for the purpose; I certainly felt the cramped dimness of the station against the vast implacability of space.

With the exception of Terrence Malick's Badlands, I cannot think of a finer directorial debut.  It is one of the tragedies of contemporary cinema, that Douglas Trumbull could not find any work as a director for years afterwards.  What a loss!  The studio completely blew it.The movie.  Yes, the premise is incoherent and it has to be dealt with.  Sometime in the early years of the next century what is left of America's forests are gathered up and put on space freighters and shipped to . . . Saturn.  Why is most unclear.  Putting the forest domes in orbit around earth would have made perfect sense. Moreover, the film goes to great lengths to show that the robots are fully capable of tending to them alone so the whole bit about the unhappy human crew is unnecessary.  But off to Saturn we go (where the light for the plants -- surprise -- is really bad).I understand that Trumbull was thinking of an alien contact story initially -- I am certain to be going out on a limb on this one -- which seemed to bear some resemblence to the Poul Anderson novella Southern Cross.  The aliens were soon dumped, however.  What remained turned out to be an utterly compelling psychological drama of a man alone in space that is unlike any SF movie I have seen (it does bear some similarity to a few Twilight Zone episodes, however).This is an astonishing technical achievement in movie making. Everything about this film works music, effects, photography, sets, acting, editing, direction, you name it.  Folks, this was done for all of one million dollars and is a hundred times more compelling than films that cost a hundred times as much.  This is art.  This is literature.  Get the DVD.

In 1971, they were ahead of their time. In fact, they are easily as good as today's CGI effects, but much more memorable for their time.

The film has a charm way beyond that which it is technically entitled to.If the environmentalism seems laid on with a trowel, remember this film would have been one of the first, if not *the* first, to put such things on the big screen. Subtlety would only work I think, when the audience is already familiar with the basic premise - that concreting over the entire planet is not such a good idea. It has a message beyond the fairly obvious environmental one though - the sheer contentment earned by those who do what is necessary, regardless of the thanks they won't get for it! The hero is not especially smart, but hes still smarter than everyone else. We are used to our heroes being mostly perfect, but where is that written in stone?

It's a typical 70's sci-fi where the earth has experienced some form of Armageddon either through war, a biological disaster, overpopulation, pollution or massive environmental catastrophe. Often with these type of movies you are left scratching your head trying to figure out what happened to the earth and how did they manage to into that mess? The plots can become convoluted and the premises pretty far fetched. Although it is true in this film it never the less is absorbing viewing not least because of Bruce Derns performance and his portrayal of the character Lowell. Again we are years in the future and the earth is void of forests with it's natural habitat. It now only exists in an artificial environment in outer space housed in domes.Bruce Dern as Lowell was well cast in this and is very believable as the odd man out in the crew of the 'Valley Forge' space freighter. The other members of the crew come across as the equivalent of company roughnecks that can't wait to return to the earth whatever it resembles. They are the face of the ugly American that you would run into in any bar in the USA swigging beer and stuffing their face with hot buffalo wings who would be more interested in NASCAR, college hoops or a pre-season Mets game than anything of real substance or importance. Lowell comes across as eccentric by comparison because he has a soul and is troubled by the companies decision to destroy the last remaining forests, presumably because of cost, what else? Bruce Dern steals the show with his performance. At the beginning he is overbearing as he preaches to his crew mates, yet this is tempered by the viewers irritation towards them with their attitude, ignorance and stupidity . As they mock and make fun of him, Lowell becomes more likable despite his obsessive personality. The viewer begins to despise the rest of the crew and their crass attitude towards their responsibilities, you have little sympathy for them when Lowell decides to sacrifice them for the greater good as he see's it. However, because he has a conscience he is riddled with guilt over their deaths but never the less sees it as the only way to save what is left of the earths natural beauty. In the end you like Lowell, he is kind, is compassionate and is prepared to sacrifice himself to make sure that what is left will survive. Although the special effects are very Gerry Anderson i.e. UFO, THUNDERBIRDS etc and it is all made in a studio it's still an interesting and entertaining watch, it's very colourful with great definition and has been digitally restored. Perhaps a remake should be done, maybe George Clooney as Lowell?

Now, after a few years of having the film in my collection,  I'm relieved to say that I recall (know) alot more about the underlying storyline therein.  Silent Running is by no means a great science fiction film; it is instead a simplistic story about one man's refusal to destroy that which is dear to his heart, against all odds.   What makes this film stand out from others, however, is a combination of great special effects (Trumbull was, of course, mentored by Stanley Kubrick on the set of 2001), a good message and... All of that emotion from Bruce Dern.  I must admit that, even after all these years, those tearful moments when Dern breaks down stick in my imagination. Looking for a fabulous, laser blastin', grostesque alien, hyperspace shoot 'em up?  Then don't rent Silent Running.

Bruce Dern is appropriately cast as the film's eco-friendly hero. Joan Baez's two songs are very much of the time, and yet add quite a lot of humanity to the 'outer space' events. The film's sets (an unused aircraft carrier conveniently converted into a spaceship!) are also notable. However, the film's most endearing elements are the two almost-human 'drones', Huey and Dewey, which contribute to some amusing and even touching interplay with Dern; they were an obvious influence on C-3P0 and R2-D2 from from the STAR WARS films.Still, I found the film to be somewhat plodding - especially since Dern is, for most of the time, the only human being on screen. In the end, SILENT RUNNING is a pretty good film, and a deserved cult item, but not a classic in the strict sense of the word. That said, it is a whole lot better than the only other feature film Trumbull directed, the dull and overblown BRAINSTORM (1983).Universal's SE DVD is so packed with extras, it's almost too much even so, there's actually little repetition throughout the lengthy documentary, numerous interviews and Trumbull's and Dern's joint commentary - and, all in all, it serves as irrefutable proof of the importance and worth (as in experience-enhancing capabilities) of DVD bonus material. While I was not overwhelmed when watching the film proper, after going through the mass of supplements on offer here I had a new-found admiration for what Trumbull intended - and actually makes me look forward to a more open-minded second viewing!

I appreciate that Silent Running attempts to convey that message. But that doesn't change the fact that it is an abysmal film on almost every level, poorly acted, poorly written, and downright insulting to the intelligence of any viewer who finished the second grade and who has even the most basic grasp of human motivation and interaction. The problems begin with the premise- the Earth's natural environment has been degraded to the point that plants can no longer grow, so the last remaining samples of forest have been put under domes for preservation. So far, so good. And then these domes are mounted on several spacecraft, and sent out into orbit of Saturn. WHY? It doesn't take any understanding of science AT ALL to realize that if you can grow trees in a dome in space, you can sure as hell grow them in a dome on Earth, and for a lot less money. And money is what the conflict in the film is supposedly about- the spacecraft are given orders to destroy the domes, after only 8 years, and the ostensible reason is that maintaining them is too expensive, and they need the ships to return to commercial service. Moreover, they aren't simply ejecting the domes into space, which would have been sufficient to destroy them- they're detonating them with nuclear explosives that were brought along for that exact purpose (we know this since each dome is equipped with a receptacle to hold the explosive charge). We're expected to believe that a government that invested in spacecraft to preserve the last vestiges of forest planned ahead by putting nuclear weapons on the ships, just in case they ever decided to destroy those forests in the most pointlessly wasteful way possible. Besides the illogical plot, Silent Running isn't even particularly entertaining. For most of it's running time, nothing happens- Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), the conservator in charge of the forests aboard the spaceship Valley Forge, is for the most part, alone. He tends his garden or talks to his robots, or sulks and cries. His performance lacks any subtlety, every emotion and expression is exaggerated into a caricature, making it impossible to empathize with Lowell. He's alternately irritating and morally reprehensible, but never identifiable.The soundtrack, while mostly unnoticeable, features a couple of original folk songs by Joan Baez that are the most sickly-sweet, stereotypical, tree-hugging hippy claptrap you will ever hear- and this is from someone who LIKES folk music. These songs clash completely with the tone of the film, and yank you right out of the experience.---PLOT SPOILERS FROM HERE ON---Back to the plot. Everyone on board the Valley Forge, with the exception of Lowell thinks that the entire enterprise is a waste of time, and wants nothing better than to ditch the forests and go home. They show the project and Lowell no respect, crushing his vegetable garden under their high speed cargo transport vehicles, which they race around the ship in like go-carts. Lowell himself is clearly unhinged from the beginning, ranting at his crewmates about the beauty of the trees and the flowers, and the apathy and destructiveness of man with a mad look in his eyes. That any supervisor would be stupid enough to put these people together in a confined space, in charge of an important mission, for an extended period of time is absolutely incredible. When the order to destroy the domes comes in, Lowell's response is predictable- before they can finish, he murders his crewmates, trapping several of them in one of the forest domes and destroying it, going against his motivation. He pretends that the ship has suffered damage and alters it's course, trying to hide from the other ships in the shadow of Saturn. The captain of one of the other ships warns him that the Valley Forge's trajectory will carry it into Saturn's ring, which will probably destroy it, and gives him the time when this will occur. But Lowell doesn't even attempt to change course, risking the safety of the last forest which his ship is carrying. And he neglects to bring the ship's maintenance robots (to whom he is emotionally attached) inside before the ship before it hits the ring, resulting in one of them being destroyed. Despite being a professional conservator, Lowell fails to realize that plants NEEDS LIGHT TO SURVIVE, and that moving the ship into Saturn's shadow starts to kill the forest. When the plants start dying he examines the leaves under a microscope and exclaims I just don't understand it. I've looked at everything, and I just don't understand it. When he realizes his error, he just sets up sun lamps to restore the trees to health- which makes his earlier oversight even more glaring, since there were already lights mounted inside the dome, they simply weren't enough without the sun. Depressed and desperate to prevent the other ships from capturing the last dome, Lowell reprograms one of the robots to maintain the forest, ejects the dome, and then destroys the Valley Forge. But if the forest dome could be maintained indefinitely with a few lights and a robot on board, then there was no reason for humans to be out there in the first place, costing the government money. Even if the humans did a better job, when funding ran out they could have simply left the domes with robot attendants rather than destroying them. The entire plot is pointless. In the end, the last forest is still doomed since no one knows it's there. Eventually the robot will break down, the lights will burn out, the power will fail, or a rock will puncture the dome. Ultimately, Lowell accomplishes nothing. Neither does the film.

But I think in the original conception of the movie Trumbull didn't even have the film as being about the environment, it was a movie about encountering aliens. The second time I watched it I felt something very different going on and I felt a very close connection to Freeman Lowell. I've been intrigued as to receptions of this character as some have been applauding his death at the end of the movie.I think the key phrase of the movie is a story Lowell tells about being a kid, writing a message on a piece of paper, putting it in a bottle and throwing it in the sea, wondering if anyone ever picked it up.I think that no-one ever reads Lowell's message. I think the key thing about him is social ineptness, you can see at the beginning that his three crewmates, whilst (unfashionably outside of the diegesis) not buying his environmentalist arguments, are all to some extent sympathetic of Lowell at points, though antagonistic at others, more out of frustration at his ineptness. He isn't able to see their point of view and doesn't seem to realise that they aren't the enemy, he doesn't recognise either their sympathy or their antagonism, misreading these attitudes as either digressive or pigheadedly hostile respectively. Lowell eventually kills these three men, who are replaced for him by three compliant robots (played by bi-lateral amputees in a nod to Tod Browning's Freaks), who are a more fitting audience for him.I think that he kills these men and that's what he intended, but he has an empathy deficit and doesn't really know what he's doing, other than defending a cause. He becomes haunted by what he's done, by the comrades he's abandoned. Lowell's misplaced integrity is a kind of purity that deserves some sort of respect. His misunderstandings the stuff of high tragedy.I just wanted to point out as well that the first time I saw this movie I didn't see anything strange or unusual in Lowell's behaviour at all, I just straight saw him as a hero. As a background I have Asperger's Syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder that is characterised by significant difficulty in social interaction. I've been learning my way out of it since my late 20s, which is why I've seen this film differently the second time round. But I can hear the silence that Lowell hears, I was always confused as a youth by the phrase, No man is an island, which I regarded simply as inaccurate. There's something very wonderful about that silence, but incredibly sad as well. Maybe the saddest moment in many sad moments comes during his eulogy for the three men where he says that although they weren't his friends he did like them. This is an experience that I have shared a lot, perhaps up until only this year unilateral friendships where I admire people that don't like me at all, just because there isn't anyway you can express the love inside you when you're socially inept, you end up accidentally upsetting people all the time.I've tried to sum this all up in the review title, Everest Flower, because I wanted to think of the remotest place possible, with an amazing clean view, and just imagine a beautiful flower growing there amidst the snow, and that reminds me of Freeman Lowell, and the person I was.The plot of the movie can be a bit basic at some points, including long dark nights of the soul that a professional botanist suffers through whilst wondering why his plants are dying before realising the obvious, that the sun isn't shining enough when you're way out past Saturn. But I don't really care.

His first major effort was the special effects for Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, though his influence was felt for twenty years after that. If anyone could be said to have been the godfather for what happens at Industrial Light and Magic, it's Trumbull.Silent Running was Trumbull's first try at directing. And he did a good job. Of course, he had great help - Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco were two of the screenwriters on this movie; it shows in the dialogue, which is taut and crisp. The cinematography, especially in the opening titles, is nothing short of amazing; they even made Joan Baez sing something worthwhile for the opening theme.The action Earth has managed to amputate its environment. No flora, no fauna but humans living inside. All the plants, animals, all the wildlife has been moved off-planet to geodesic domes in space (as to why put the stuff in space? there's no objective reason that really holds water to a serious sci-fi buff, but it does set up the resolution of the plot). Bruce Dern plays the last dedicated conservationist, on one of the spacecraft carrying the wildlife.The opening tragedy the bean counters back on Earth decide they can't afford to tie up all those spacecraft to save a few hundred trees and bunnies, so the crews of the spacecraft are ordered to use miniature nuclear devices to humanely destroy all the wildlife in space.Bruce Dern's character can't reconcile following those orders with the passion of his life to save Earth's wildlife. And there is the action of the film - he fights, he resists, he refuses, and he acts.This is a strong, violent, thrilling ride. You don't have to be a tree-hugger to enjoy it; the movie converts you to its point of view - Trumbull, his writers and his cast do what good movie makers do, they convince you to suspend any skepticism you may have about what happens in the film.This is one of the few science fiction films I come back to again, and again for enjoyment, because it rises over its few flaws to captivate and entertain. At the end, no matter what your sympathies may be in the debate over ecology, you cheer for the protagonist, or you weep for him silently, but you aren't indifferent. A clear sign of a good movie.

If you're reading this and asking Who?, well I'll tell you. He first became known as the visual effects artist on Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, had just done the same for Robert Wise's The Andromeda Strain, and would later also serve in the same position on Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. One of his associates on this film was one John Dykstra who would later be acclaimed for his work on Star Wars a.k.a Episode IV A New Hope. Okay, the plot has Freeman Lowel (Bruce Dern) taking care of a forest put in a dome in space because Earth had become inhabitable because of various ecological problems. While he's serious about his work, his work mates John Keenan (Cliff Potts), Marty Barker (Ron Rifkin), and Andy Wolf (Jesse Vint), are more interested in riding fast in some go-cart-like vehicles and generally getting out of space since they've all been there for a long time. Eventually, they're all told to go home. However, there's something else about the order Freeman doesn't like...While the lead character doesn't always generate sympathy, one does feel for him because of his passions and his struggles to deal with his situations. He even decides to name a couple of his robot friends Huey and Dewey instead of the numbers they previously were called. Written by Deric Washburn, Michael (Mike) Cimino, and Steven (Steve) Bochco (yes, the future Oscar-winning director and the future co-creator of Hill Street Blues), Silent Running is a very compelling sci-fi drama about what it would be like if one man had to choose between what he believes and what he'd do to maintain that. Dern is very good as someone who tries to be hopeful but gets increasingly desperate. This film is not without humor, however, such as when he teaches the robots a card game especially when he laughs. And the music of Peter Schickele with lyrics sung by Joan Baez are hauntingly beautiful when they play on the soundtrack. So if you love sci-fi and care about the environment, I highly recommend Silent Running.

The film has it's flaws only because it was an experiment; make a movie for under a million dollars and do it in 32 days. What was done is a miracle considering this much.It was visually more advanced in fact than other films that came after until Star Wars. So 2001 was the father of Silent Running and Silent Running was the father of upstart Star Wars, this by virtue of the fact that Douglas Trumbell worked on 2001 and then Silent Running and then John Dykstra who worked on Silent Running went on to Star Wars.For me at least this is the importance of the film as a filmaking milestone in terms of film history and for those who want to know this history it is worth viewing. The story is compelling enough to hold the viewer.

They found joy and fulfillment in each other. We are the same as they are and the fact that we think we need more than they do is a result of societal pressure and cultural norms, not fact. It is society that distracts us from enjoying the essentials.Freeman illustrates the fact that because feelings are internal, we don't need as much externally as we think we do.

Bruce Dern gives the kind of complex, anguished performance that would characterize the body of his later work. He's certainly got issues in this film, as the biologist of a cluster of forests sent into deep space for safe keeping, the earth having been rendered all but uninhabitable by pollution. When the orders come from Dick Cheney (oops, sorry -- wrong movie -- or is it?) to jettison and destroy the forests, he has to decide between his shipmates and the animals and trees...The real star behind the scenes is rookie director Douglas Trumbull, who would become more famous for his ground-breaking special photographic effects on 2001 and Bladerunner than as the director he aspired to be. This was Trumbull's first time at the helm, a job he took reluctantly because no one else wanted it (the film was made for a shoestring, and shot mostly on location aboard the defunct aircraft carrier Valley Forge, which lends its name to the spacecraft in the film.)This was one of five movies made by Universal on the cheap, after the phenomenal success of the low-budget Easy Rider. Of the five, Silent Running was a modest success, though it suffering from lack of publicity, an erroneous decision made by the bean-counters in the Universal Tower. The other success was American Graffiti. Each movie was made for a paltry one million dollars. It would have been far too easy to turn this film into a movie of the week, with sentiment slapped on with a trowel. Dern and Trumbull deftly avoid this trap with ease, and the movie remains one of the sweetest, saddest environmentalist/Sci-fi movies ever. Trumbull describes himself in the accompanying featurette as a loner, more comfortable with technology than people, and it's clear that Dern picked up on this. His character is alienated, flawed, but very, very human. As fellow iconoclast Hunter Thompson once said, Buy the ticket -- take the ride.Although the story takes center stage, Trumbull's special effects hold up very well and have a far more organic feel than today's CGI. One of the youngsters hired for the model shop was John Dykstra, who would go on to the ground-breaking motion-control effects of the first Star Wars.Be sure to screen the DVD edition, with a commentary track featuring Trumbull and Dern, and a couple of nice additional features about the making of the movie and about Trumbull's most interesting career.

One such station is maintained by a crew of four and led by an idealistic nature lover named Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern). When the crew receives an order to destroy the preserve and return to commercial service, Lowell sets out to protect his forests by any means necessary. As a result, he ends up being the only human at the station after it is presumed destroyed and begins a project of teaching his small robot servants to help him to look after the forest. The idyll is hard to maintain, however.What strikes the viewer immediately about the film is the quality of the sets and props on screen. Huge space stations floating through space reach towards a 2001-esque atmosphere and the production design of the small race cars, the toddling drone robots and the circular pool table looks very nice. The green forest and small animals also look great, and it's fun to see Lowell cultivate his private garden like a king, assisted by childlike drones who he lovingly names Huey, Dewey and Louie after the nephews of Donald Duck.Unfortunately, what the film wins in visuals, it loses in writing. The wistful wandering in the woods to Joan Baez songs comes across as very naive, even laughably so, and Lowell's idealism contrasted to the indifference of the other crew members doesn't seem too subtle anymore, if it ever did. Even though Lowell spends most of the time completely alone with the mute drones or a just voice on the radio, the film doesn't get much out of the delicious situation. I hoped there would be more focus on the effect of stress, loneliness and guilt on Lowell's mind, but since the forest always stays number one for him, there's not much psychological tension present in the story, or at least it is presented poorly. This ultimately reduces the film to a cute technology show with an environmental message, when it had potential for being a much more thought-provoking sci-fi tale. Even so, the visual style and the tragic ending are easily enough to make Silent Running a very watchable movie; it is also interesting as a product of its socially aware time.

At a time where nothing grows on our home planet anymore and people no longer care about the trees, the plants, the birds and other wildlife, it's the job of Lowell and his cohorts to man a spaceship which contains several giant domed globes securing the world's last surviving forests, at least for the time being. This is a story of what happens when chief orders are issued for the astronauts to abandon their mission, return home to Earth, but to first blow up all of the forests. Dern is the only dedicated member of the crew who will do whatever it takes to defy his orders and save nature from man's destruction, no matter what the cost.This is a good science fiction tale with a message, and this is brought home by two Joan Baez environmental songs which she sings over the soundtrack. Bruce Dern is ideally cast as the well-meaning naturist who finds that his only true friends aboard his spacecraft are his three small assisting drones whom he affectionately christens Huey, Dewey, and Louie. These miniature robots were acted by real-life amputee actors without legs, who were placed inside the shells of these automatons, and who walked on their hands to bring them to life. Young first-time director Douglas Trumbull was also the special effects maestro who worked on Kubrick's classic 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, and he referred to SILENT RUNNING as my first student project. It's a great testimony to his talent that this film turned out as well as it did, even though today it plays more like a simple yet high-spirited telefilm. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"Probably my favorite movie of all time.","Date":"30 April 2002","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I first saw this movie back in the 70s on television when I was in school. It really hit a chord in me. I realize it was a bit heavy handed but then again trying to pack this much stuff into 90 minutes isn't easy.Once you get past the original idea of the only remaining forest/nature being in pods on spaceships the rest of the movie hangs together very nicely. I've seen some critics go after Bruce Dern as being too overboard but in the context of the movie and his character it made perfect sense. In light of what was happening his character would have been overboard in real life.Some minor spoilers ahead!The basic plot is fairly straight forward. Due to pollution Earth has placed the last remaining forests and wildlife on board gigantic pods in long orbit until enough land can be reclaimed to replant the forests on Earth. Bruce Dern plays a scientist, Freeman Lowell, who has dedicated his life to the project and had spent more than a decade in space nurturing the pods on his ship, one of a fleet of such ships. The other 3 crew members are typical jock types that are rotated through and can't comprehend why Lowell cares about the forests. They grew up without being around them. Only one of them really tries to understand and relate to Lowell. After the set up the movie really starts. Due to budget cuts the project is canceled and the fleet is ordered to jettison and destroy the pods and return to Earth. Not hard to picture in real life with politicians being what they are.Lowell loses it when they start blowing the pods up and tries to save one of them. He reports a massive malfunction and the loss of control of the ship heading off into deep space. The rest of the movie revolves around his attempt to evade the rescue ships that are trying to help him and to keep the forest alive with ever dwindling resources. He is assisted by 3 robot drones, obviously named Huey, Dewey and Louie. The interaction between Lowell and the drones is really a high point to the movie. The drones become surrogate companions and help keep him sane.Eventually Earth manages to work out a rescue plan, which will mean the destruction of the last pod and thus the last forest. At that point Lowell has to make some hard choices. The rest of the movie flows very naturally from the choices.Every time I see the last scene from the film I get pretty choked up. Back in the 70s when I first saw it on TV my mother caught the last part of the movie. She was most certainly not a science fiction fan, and definitely not overly sentimental but she started crying at the end.Is it a perfect movie? Nope, but it's a thoughtful exploration of a man's dedication and of what looked like a possible future ecological  nightmare in the early 70s. I recommend this film to anyone with an interest in those topics.

First up the bad things (and this movie IS flawed, to try and pretend it isn't would be a lie). The environmental message the movie conveys isn't all that subtle and veers towards New Age propaganda territory. Many will find it way too simplistic and hippie-like. The special effects are dated, which may be a problem for many contemporary viewers (not me, I could care less). And the songs by Joan Baez on the soundtrack are, in a word, horrible. The good points far outweigh the bad in my mind. The movie isn't obsessed with action, but ideas and character. Something which is sadly missing from almost all contemporary SF movies. Bruce Dern ('Bloody Mama', 'The King Of Marvin Gardens', 'The Trip', 'Family Plot') is terrific as Freeman Lowell, a scientist who refuses to terminate the project he has passionately devoted several years of his life to. Whether you agree or disagree about his course of action is up to you, but there's no denying that he makes the movie compelling viewing. Dern is a criminally underrated actor, and this is one of his most memorable performances. '2001' special effects whizz Douglas Trumball made his directorial debut with 'Silent Running', and it may be heresy to say this, but I get much more enjoyment out of watching this than Kubrick's more celebrated and discussed film. (I have mixed feelings about '2001', admiring it more than actually liking it. An important movie milestone without a doubt, but by no means my favourite Kubrick work). An interesting side note - glance at the screen writing credits. They include TV king Steven Bochco ('NYPD Blue',etc.) and Michael Cimino director of 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Days Of Heaven'.

I have heard that showing the world he could do Saturn was one motivation for making Silent Running. He did a great job... but...*** Spoiler starts here *** The science fiction fan in me has to ask why were the ark ships in orbit around Saturn to begin with? Sending ships of that size to Saturn would be enormously expensive (trillions of dollars and decades for design/construction/testing and the voyage itself). It would make far more sense to keep them in Earth orbit. This ties in with the reason the forest is dying--it's too far away from the sun. (For a back-to-nature guy, it takes Bruce Dern a very long time to realize this.) But if the ark ships are in Earth orbit, you don't get to show off your Saturn special effects. And you can rotate the crews instead of stranding them two billion+ miles from Earth, which is a surefire recipe to make people crazy.I am sure my comments strike some folks as unnecessarily picky. But this movie was advertised as science fiction, and the science in a science fiction story has to make sense. (Note the triple appearance of the word science in the last sentence.) A good science fiction film, of which there are very few, should have an internally logical story--the special effects should enhance the story, not drive the plot. Trumbull would have been far better off enlisting the aid of his old boss's writing partner, Arthur C. Clarke, who co-created one of the great science fiction films. Aside from the holes in the story logic, I rated this film highly, because it does pose important questions, and aspires to be something more than the usual space opera.

Alone, Lowell's only company are three drones and his sanity is slowly tested as they drift deeper into space.Silent Running is a very bittersweet film that has heart and sadness in it. It is centred around a great performance by Dern gives an intense, committed performance, made even more impressive because he had to work around for a majority of the film. Director Douglas Turnbull was also able to give the three drones plenty of personality and makes you care for them, from their looks to each other, there body language and actions.Silent Running is a very politically minded film about its themes about environmentalism, deforestation and protecting natural landscapes. The film through Lowell does become very preachy and forceful with his viewpoint, but that is compared to an attitude of apathy and not seeing a real problem on Earth. Even now we have this debate and back in the 70s the issues of environmentalism were less pronounced.Silent Running has a constantly bleak and sombre tone, both about in its grand themes and it the personal story about Lowell, all leading to a bittersweet ending.Turnball came from a special effects background and his experience shows on screen with fantastic, having great model work, art direction and costumes of the drones. There is a great scene of detail and scene of scale. Turnball put his experience on 2001 A Space Odyssey to good use. The interior shots of the station also well done, having that 70s version of the future. The only real criticism is the explosions are only shown as The music by Peter Schickele added to the atmosphere, from the soft piano to a moment with more grand moments when showing the exterior.It is clear how Silent Running influenced films like Moon and WALL-E with its story, style, themes and scenes.

One such film of this kind was, ironically enough, a film that marked the directing debut of 2001's principal special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull--SILENT RUNNING. Done on a fairly modest budget of just slightly over $1 million, SILENT RUNNING inevitably will seem dated to some after four decades; its message, however, remains all too timely.Set in a far distant future, where Earth's ecology has become a permanent train wreck, SILENT RUNNING generally takes place in the deepest and most isolated part of the Solar System onboard the American Airlines-sponsored deep-space freighter Valley Forge, which houses three different types of what is left of Earth's greenery in geodesic domes, all of which are tended to by a very dedicated scientist (Bruce Dern). But then comes the news that Valley Forge is being ordered back to Earth; and while that prospect pleases Dern's three human cohorts (Cliff Potts; Ron Rifkin; Jesse Vint), the fact that part of those orders also include nuking the geodesic domes and the remaining plant and animal life doesn't sit at all well with Dern. With the help of two drone robots, and even after Potts, Rifkin, and Vint blow two of the three domes up, Dern takes control of the 2000 foot-long freighter, leaving the one remaining domed example of Earth life attached to the main body of the ship, and putting the ship on a course that will take it around the planet Saturn and its glorious ring system and back to Earth. Having jettisoned his human companions, who showed utter indifference to the conservation project from the beginning, he then instructs the drones in how to maintain these last remnants of Earth life.Having achieved a lot as a special effects supervisor, first on 2001 and then on THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN in 1970-71, Trumbull managed to wangle his way into the director's chair for Silent Running, which was loosely based on an idea he himself had written a treatment for just after 2001 and which then was shaped into a screenplay by Deric Washburn, Mike Cimino (later to direct the 1978 Vietnam War epic THE DEER HUNTER), and Steven Bochco. The elaborate nature of the story, dealing with futuristic ecology and conservation, would seem to have been hemmed in by the film's rather low budget and a shooting schedule of just over a month; but Trumbull managed to pull this off by shooting all of SILENT RUNNING on location, both on the real-life, decommissioned aircraft carrier Valley Forge in Long Beach and at a hangar at Van Nuys Municipal Airport in the spring of 1971. Trumbull also had the task, of course, of supervising the special effects, along with good friends Richard Yuricich and John Dykstra (both of whom he would reunite with on STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE), and, given the relative paucity of the budget, they still managed to work. As this is also a character-driven piece, it is up to Dern to largely carry the film as the ambitious botanist; and while his penchant for vituperative acting erupts at times, he does a solid job of playing somebody who is not an over-the-top nut case. The presence of Joan Baez's songs as part of the score by Peter Schickele (alias P.D.Q. Bach) may be the one thing that dates SILENT RUNNING, but it doesn't date it too seriously.Though only a moderate box office success, due to Universal's lackluster advertising campaign, SILENT RUNNING remains a thoroughly interesting film, particularly as it presages certain elements of films like the 2006 ecological documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH and even parts of Disney's 2008 animated sci-fi opus WALL-E. Even with decades of special effects advancement, especially with CGI, the effects in this film still stand up to a lot of scrutiny. But more importantly, the message being told in SILENT RUNNING remains timely to this day, and it is an important one We humans need to preserve our planet, or else there will come a day when there won't be anything left here.

Despite my general ambiguity toward sci-fi, I decided to give it a go, its plot an intriguing one to say the least.At an unspecified point in the future, the Valley Forge is one of several large cargo vessels sent out to space with a plethora of plant life forms aboard. Much to the chagrin of resident botanist Lowell, the command centre orders these destroyed and the freighters returned to earth, an order he is resolutely disinclined to obey.One of the things I really like about Silent Running is the opening calm shots of rainforest paradise we are first treated to, and the way in which the camera slowly and deceptively toys with us to eventually reveal this lush environment as synthetic and cosmic. It's quite an impressive effect, allowing us to appreciate the loneliness and sense of abandonment in this other world. The strange beauty of Lowell's nirvana is soon disrupted by his rather less considerate fellow crew members, with whom he shares a clear disaffection. Their complicity in destroying the assorted ecosystems they originally swore to protect is a clear nod to the vast majority of the human population, and the foreshadower of a theme which becomes increasingly relevant as this film ages. Lowell's steps to protect his beloved forest originally seem to him inconsequential, though as the film progresses these appear to take a greater toll on his increasingly fragile mind. Close as this comes, the level of guilt he harbours never quite manages to become significant enough to take the film to a new level a level of real psychological drama which would earn it even greater respect. As it unfolds, Lowell teeters precariously on the brink of antiheroism, his sinister gaze and soft speech encouraging more fear than sympathy. Dern plays this well, the moments where we most support the main character engendered primarily by the subtlest of movements across his face. The mental journey of this character is just slightly too underplayed, its effect falling just short of what it could have been.Offering a complex and fascinating character study, Silent Running bears a strong environmentalist message that seems to maintain a relationship of inverse proportion to its age. Missing out on that little extra to take it to the next level, it trips over itself slightly in its characterisation. Having stood the test of time well, it is clear as an influential and important part of science-fiction history.

Usually on TV when its been on. Ned Beatty I should say a few things first. I've always considered Ned Beatty a very odd actor. I don't get exactly how he had a career beyond the last 1960s biker-hippy movies he was in (although he is fantastic as the old kook -- a role he was born to play -- on HBO's Big Love). ANYWAY...so I wouldn't normally be attracted to a movie with him in the lead role. And certainly not in a movie where he plays the sole role for most of the film (a'la Tom Hanks in Castaway). I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF DRAWN TO THIS FILM!!! I sort of sit there and watch it all the way through.The Message As a few others have commented the ecological message can be a little heavy handed at times, but I still find the film strangely compelling. I don't consider it a Sci-Fi film. The effects aren't that great (even for its time) and the robotics are laughable. But it still has a haunting quality to it. It's a dystopic view of a possible future when humanity flushes its natural resources down the tubes. One man makes a radical choice to save the last forests. It's crazy at times, yes. But still its a character study.The Music/Baez As for people who hate the film, I think this film would've been improved A THOUSAND FOLD if they released it with a new soundtrack. The Joan Baez soundtrack of AWFUL! Treacly message heavy crap. Seriously, this film could use a redub. I'm not sure what would soundtrack would be better but Baez's songs make this little more than a Billy Jack movie with a better known warbling folk songstress. I think if you subtracted the Baez songs all the people who hated this film would find it a hell of a lot more palatable.I have to agree with commentators who've mentioned the charming way that the three robots emote (there's no better word for it) so well. They really are expressive even though they're such simple objects. You find yourself sympathizing with them in a strange way. Part of this is Beatty's relating to them. Sort of hysterically silly at times but still effective in taking them as real characters.The ending is odd and perhaps implausible but this movie still holds up for the questions it brings up for the viewer. We are still dealing with many of these concepts so the film is visionary and ahead of its time in many ways. Its look at a heavily corporatized future (which is really there for people who notice it and not an explicit statement) it pretty visionary too. We're living in that reality.Watch it. You'll enjoy it.

Bruce Dern who is so often the supporting player for bigger stars here gets a chance to shine. He does a good job in fleshing out a character who you're never really sure you actually like or even agree with but who is fantastically moving. Crude as they are the 3 robots have such anthropomorphic presence you can't help but take to them, in many ways they're the most empathetic of all the characters. It's very much a film which makes you think, at the time it was made environmentalism was still in its' infancy, nowadays it would be far more topical (and indeed you wonder why no one has remade it?)It's not perfect and you ask many questions. The project is called off and the domes will not return to Earth. OK but why destroy them using mini-nukes? Why not just leave them in orbit? Why the hell are the eco-ships orbiting Saturn? Why aren't they closer to the sun? It seems strange that they left it until one of the robots was destroyed before naming them after Donald Duck's 3 nephews. I'm staggered it got a U rating, I mean Bruce Dern's character murders his fellow astronauts, not just by ejecting them and destroying the dome with the mini-nuke but by crushing the windpipe of the one he likes best with a shovel? And then commits suicide at the end? But overall it is a truly great and original film and I'd love to see a remake.

An eight year old could have written a better plot twist.Very disappointing. Considering the talent involved (co-written by Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco!!), I was expecting better. The story actually is about someone who loves trees and plants more than human life. He is willing to take the lives of human beings to save his forest -- OK, I'm the most least ardent conservationist around, but that's way overboard! --, and he is presented as an otherwise nice guy. Unfortunately, because Bruce Dern plays him, he comes off whacko. About the one thing worth watching this for, is the silly waddling droids, which actually contain real-life double amputee monkeys. Aside from that, this film got sillier and more boring as it journeyed slowly towards its ending.Despite its contemporary message that we have to preserve the world around us, the film shows its 1970's origin rather obviously. Maybe its the orange carpenting in space, or the fluffy hair-dos. Maybe its the racing around in little Go-Karts. Who knows? Having read Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring' I could see that book's influence all over this pretentious movie. The idea itself is interesting. The Valley Forge, along with several other ships, is transporting pristine natural environments to a new home. This is the last of earth's destroyed ecology. For an unknown reason, a voice over the radio tells the crew (who all but Bruce Dern inexplicably seem to hate their assignment, nature, trees and natural food) to destroy their cargo. Dern's character rather lamely wrestles with the issue before killing the rest of the crew (not as exciting as it sounds) and hijacking the Valley Forge. Like the spaceship, the film really gets nowhere. It's an education in how the times can influence a movie and how we used to have small people/monkeys work tiny robots rather than use CGI. I was glad when this film ended. Perhaps it would have been mildly enjoyable on Mystery Science Theater. It's that type of movie. Probably made a good short Sci-Fi story. Only for those who love Bruce Dern (not I) or have an interest in film and social history.Although it doesn't hold a candle to 2001 (which preceded it).

Lowell does some things one can't exactly condone, but you do understand the man. Thanks to a powerhouse performance by Mr. Dern, you can still sympathize with the man and be moved by his loneliness and social awkwardness. True enough that a story like this would seem like a pretty hard sell to studios, even 43 years ago, since there are no female characters and the main person isn't all that noble.Special effects veteran Douglas Trumbull, renowned for his work on 2001 A Space Odyssey, obviously has a real affinity for creating interesting environments and striking visuals. He uses these visuals just as much as any dialogue in telling the story, which is a pretty entertaining one; it was scripted by Deric Washburn, Michael Cimino, and Steven Bochko. The effects are nicely done, and those robot characters - referred to here as drones - do have some personality, and are highly endearing, if not as memorable as, say, R2-D2 from Star Wars.The songs, by Joan Baez, and score, composed and conducted by Peter Schickele, are lovely.Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin, and Jesse Vint are all fun as Lowells' younger, more carefree associates, but after a while only Dern remains as the sole human presence on screen.

But even if it's paining a negative picture of what remains to come, one thing if for sure, deforestation is running rampantly and if we don't act soon, forest life could be on the brink of total oblivion.One thing that strikes the right cord for me about Silent Running the wonderful performance by Bruce Dern. In past Mr. Dern has built a reputation as playing evil, demented crazy guys and of course pop culture enthusiasts will know the in one of John Wayne's movies, Mr. Dern was that only guy who ever killed off a John Wayne character. After the release of that movie he got a very bad rap for it too. Which is a shame really when you think about it because he's such an under-rated performance. Here, Dern breaks away from type-casting to play a more sensitive person, who is potentially on the brink of going insane. But his restrained persona is very hard to notice, but as this movie progresses, we know his hidden madness is only a motion away. That truly defines what exceptional acting is all about. The cast is also quite effective in their respected roles as well.Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin and Jesse Vint who show a lucrative level of contempt for Dern's character are all very impressive in their respected roles. It was also a treat to watch the performers who played the robotic drones Huey, Dewey and Louie.This movie was the original ultimate sci-fi long before Star Wars and it stands on its own merits quite well and it's held up compared to today's movie that heavily depend on more fast pace, harder action, more blood and gratuitous violence.

It is sensitive and thought-provoking, however in that it continues to remind us that our precious natural resources are just that and more of us need to care if we are to save this planet.

From his caterpillar's-eye view behind the opening credits to the claustrophobic interiors to the closing very long pullback he did not disappoint. (The end credits should remind you of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, on which Trumbull also participated.)Later viewings and readings revealed the production design and FX were a triumph of innovation and plain hard work over accounting principles. They had a whole aircraft carrier to play on!Holes in the premise and ongoing plot were (and remain) plentiful. They did not distract me but inspired me to fill them long after I was taken for the cinematic ride.The setting was further along the optimist's future than popularly inferred, what with artificial gravity without a centrifuge, no visible means of space freighter propulsion, semi-autonomous maintenance drones that I positively marveled at, skintight spacesuits, and a fleeting inference by the lead character of terrestrial climate (or damage?) control. (Then again, perhaps accounting principles DID sometimes prevail.)Shooting the rapids through a quadrant of the outer rings had to involve Saturn's upper atmosphere, for even then we were not quite sure what that planet's rings were truly made of. And I knew Trumbull had set his sights on Saturn because the gas giant was supposed to have been the spaceship Discovery's destination in 2001.The ecological/environmental theme was timely, likely because we were just coming around to realize the only people who would make a difference were us. And, no, for the record, I did not endorse Freeman Lowell's countermeasures though they certainly made me wonder what would happen next...Though the film score's songs were rendered troppo vibrato the sum of the music gently supported the film and enhanced some scenes. This was clearly not space music. Years passed before I recognized the composer.And though the script couldn't have given Bruce Dern much guidance in his characterization of Lowell he gave everything he had, which showed in every frame. Lowell's equally fleeting reference to Everything is the same, all the people are exactly the same on Earth while trying to provoke some response from his shipmates also supplied plenty for me to privately ponder for awhile...This film may not age well but is to be forgiven its faults.

When they are given orders to destroy their bio-domes, crewman Freeman Lowell rebels, kills his shipmates and pilots the ship away in a desperate bid to preserve the forests from extinction &#133;Silent Running is a very enjoyable but curious film for several reasons. The premise is pretty unique - plant ecology in outer space ? Dern (who is terrific) has to carry the last hour of the movie by himself - what other commercial film has only one character ? And most intriguingly for me, the film is a contradictory mixture of biological and synthetic, ancient and modern, primal and cerebral. The conservation theme is right-on, and Lowell is clearly a hippy tree hugging flower child, complete with acolyte robe and Joan Baez soundtrack, but Trumbull is a technical genius and his film is deliberately full of amazing hardware, robots, cold steel and industrial mechanics. This contrast of fir trees, bubbling brooks and mulched earth with the gun-metal grey and fluorescent lights of the ship is sensational, as the huge craft glide soundlessly through the cold spaces, courtesy of great visual effects by John Dykstra, Richard Yuricich and Trumbull. Also of note are the excellent physical performances by Sparks, Persons, Brown and Whisenhunt as the little robots; all four actors were multiple amputees who performed their characters in real time, giving them great intimacy and nuance in scenes like the poker game. When Lowell accidentally hits Huey with the buggy, you wince with pain and anguish (or at least you do if you have a soul), despite the fact that he's just a hunk of plastic. Written by Deric Washburn, Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco, and shot in a decommissioned aircraft carrier (the USS Valley Forge) in Long Beach, California; the ship name also comes from a national park in Pennsyvlania. This film is not perfect by any account - for one thing most of the premise makes little sense - but it is a lovely, gentle, nicely paced, highly original, thought-provoking little movie. A flawed gem. "},{"Title":"Great Movie!!!!!","Date":"16 September 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" this movie was fantastic!

Judged from the perspective of a 2006 moviegoer, this science fiction film certainly isn't perfect in terms of special effects, although for the time it was made they were actually quite good - especially if one takes the tiny budget into account. But you don't watch this movie for breathtaking action sequences (watch Star Wars instead) or fascinating aesthetics (watch 2001 instead). The wonderful thing about this movie is its very unusual plot A sensitive loner refuses to destroy the last remains of nature left from earth, kills his three colleagues instead, and embarks on an incredibly lonesome trip through space, only accompanied by plants, some animals, three taciturn robots and his own feelings of guilt. Finally, when he's unexpectedly discovered, instead of letting himself be rescued, he blows up his ship, including himself. The only thing that remains is the last existing forest, drifting through space eternally under a geodesic dome, cared for only by a robot, SAVED FROM MANKIND. This movie quite provokingly asks the question if nature wouldn't be better off without us human beings, and it does not provide an easy answer. Its sad and desperate atmosphere is wonderfully emphasized by Bruce Dern's intense acting, and by Joan Baez' haunting songs. Despite all its technical flaws, this movie is still a tremendously touching and impressive piece of art, because the story is just so powerful and disturbing.

It goes off at odd tangents, but the big point is to Take Good Care Of The Forest. The three of them gave the best performances of their lives, only one of them saying anything and most of that comes across as unscripted. Probably the biggest drawback with the film was Joan Baez's dated manic warbling of hippy-drippy axioms always at the wrong moment; it made me cringe the first time I heard it in 1976, and gives the lie to the title. But even her music hasn't dated as badly as Blade Runner. The special effects were good although a lot of the props now remind me of 8-track cartridge players. There's no help for it, you must make allowances for all of that! And maybe it's good to remember that at this time of writing Mankind has not set foot on the Moon since those ancient primitive times either. The climax should be cringe-worthy too but isn't &#x96; the contrived poignancy is overwhelming by then.

This is a very different kind of movie.In the far future, the only remaining forests are inside of domes many miles up into space, where nobody seems to care about them anymore. Except for Freeman Lowell, who has been maintaining the forests for over 15 years, most recently alongside three others, and is a flamboyant environmentalist. But orders are given to blow up the domes and return home, he decides to go rouge by disobeying orders, killing his team members, and claiming that this last forest as a detonation problem, not letting it die by explosives. Then he retreats into deep space after jettisoning his cargo in an attempt to signal the others that he has been blown up, hence the name 'silent running.' His only companions are his three robots that would be ripped off by war hammer 40k in their dreadnaught design. I am serious! The design is TOO similar! This movie's strength is it's drama. Freeman Lowell is like a normal human being in the future. This is reflected when he names the three drones Huey, Dewey, and Louie. But in the end, the rest of the ships discover him and are about to close in. Lowell realizes they would be able to find out that he murdered his crew mates and disobeyed, so before the other ships board, he blows up his own space cruiser, Valley forge. If you are not a fan of slow movies, this isn't the one for you. It is atmospheric, with little music, but some of it is sung by Joan Baez. It was the 70's, ladies and gentlemen. Embrace it!

Kind of neat.I've seen this movie a few times, and have always wanted to like it. And I do, after a fashion. It's sci-fi. Passionate sci-fi. Sci-fi with a message, but it seems to be uneven in the thematic department.You got a guy who's some-kind of naturalist/botanist/biologist on board a vessel carrying what we presume to be the last of Earth's natural habitats in pressurized domes. Things go wrong, he objects, and the events take a turn for the worse.I think what was really missing here was some more grounding for the film. Bruce Dern's character is almost a bit too passionate, suggesting a kind of mental illness. But, did the character need to be crazy to preserve the last of mother nature? Lord knows we have our militant environmentalists. But, could the script have not gone a different direction? Could Dern's character not have been more stable and gone about achieving his goal without all the hoopla? I wonder.The 70s was an awful time for the environment. Industrial pollution and pollution from cars had really done a number on land, sea and air. Something had to be done. The artistic community responded with song, paintings, a few documentaries, and Hollywood's offering was Silent Running.The gist here is that denying oneself of our natural surroundings can drive one crazy. And the appropriate response is an outburst because of the lunacy of losing one's natural environment. At least, that's the idea.I'm not sure I really buy this. It seems a little too pat. A little too simple and easy. But, at the same time, dramatically it works. The film is what it is, and delivers not so much a Green message, but good old fashioned conservationist message. Like your grandfather who used to hunt and fish, and advocated not taking more than you needed.Silent Running is more of worst case scenario for a bleak future. It works, but seems more like a TV episode for what might've been a larger dramatic effort.Not a bad piece of sci-fi. Give it a shot.

One such actor is Bruce Dern. True he began acting in the 1960's in roles so thin he often remained uncredited. However, in this rare opportunity, Bruce Dern plays Freeman Lowell, the hero of the movie Silent Running. The story takes place far off in the future, when Earth's remaining forests, wildlife and vegetation have been preserved in gigantic domed enclosures with the intent on one day 'reforesting' the planet. However after eight long years in deep space, the ordered does come from Earth, but it's not to save the pods, but to destroy their cargo. Though he tries to convince his fellow crewmen Cliff, (John Keenan) Marty, (Ron Rifkin) and Andy (Jesse Vint) that what their doing is unconscionable, they point out it's only a job and not their decision. Lowell realizes he has no choice but to choose between his friends and his mission. In his care are three tiny robots which become an integral part of the movie and add to the final ingredients which propels this film into the annals of Classic cinema. This role will become the epitome of Bruce Dern's career. **** "},{"Title":"Ahead of its time and still relevant","Date":"1 May 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" It is unbelievable this movie was made in 1972.

The storyline is still relevant in the current context of global warming and the conflict between technology and ecology. One interesting message I think that is lost on many people is that technology is our ultimate hope of preserving the beauty of nature in all its forms; the final image of a robot tending to the forest is a metaphor for the entire film.To top it off, the acting and production design are extremely convincing considering the premise that the story asks the viewer to accept; it requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief, and the film pulls it off completely.

For heaven's sake, he was a _botanist_, remember? That was the _reason_ he was on the mission (and had been for eight years) he was curator of the greenhouses on the American Airlines cargo vessel Valley Forge. Duh. Now, I don't presume to apologize for Lowell's actions after he kills the first fellow crewman in a fight--accidentally beaning him with a spade in a minor squabble over the jettison-and-detonate orders--there was absolutely no reason to follow through on the particular greenhouse that he knew to contain the last two crewmen. But, Lowell indeed has a conscience that's why we see him degenerate into insanity, talking to the drones as if they were people (The man had a full house and he knew it! Ha ha ha ha ha!) and surrendering his formerly neat habits, gradually letting the ship take on the appearance of a pigsty, with unwashed food trays ditched here and there. (Actually, he doesn't seem to really lose it until the third drone, Louie, is lost during a meteor storm, leaving a solitary mechanical foot embedded in the gridwork for the other two to cogitate over.) But he knew he couldn't face the music (even though his alibi probably would have been bought) when the Berkshire came looking for him after he went into silent running on the far side of Saturn--where he was unreachable by radio until sunrise (he should have known that Saturn rotates in a mere 1016, hardly enough time for the ship to take on such a careless look, but nobody said his orbit was geosynchronous)--and that's why he made his ultimate decision. The ticking clock toward the very end, while quite ominous, is also quite touching. I recall that, when I saw this movie as a nine-year-old, I cried. This gentle man wanted nothing more than to feed his rabbits or let the bittern alight on his arm, but the establishment wouldn't grant him those simple pleasures. His tortured reminiscences of Earth--with its steady 75-degree temperature, entirely mechanized surface, etc.--reminded me of Dr. Sevrin (the immortal Skip Homeier) in Star Trek's The Way to Eden, lamenting over how the synthesized, mechanized, homogenized world was to blame for his contraction of Synthococcus novae.

I have no problems with the message of SIlent Running per se, although in retrospect it is a little naive, simplistic (they didn't know about things like global warming, obviously). It has its heart in the righ place, but like most propaganda it's more concerned with beating the viewer over his complacent, hypocritical head with THE MESSAGE. Propagandists are rarely also good dramatists. They don't realize that for a message to be effective, touching, etc., you have to care about the characters and what's happening to them. Here, the real main character is the forest; it's what you end up caring for, crying over when it's being nuked or shot out into deep space for eternity. In a movie that's not a good thing, because it means that the humans who do all the acting are all detestable, as they're all ciphers, pawns in service of THE MESSAGE.Dramatically the movie is on about the level of a high-school writing class project the main human character is essentially a thinly disguised mouth for the author (or authors as it were, including the same Steven Bochco who later created LA Law), the others simplified objects of self-righteous hate or cute sidekicks who serve little function outside of giving said main character something to do for an hour after said objects of hate have been killed off. Bruce Dern as our demented hippie astronaut has absolutely all the personality and charm in this movie, as well as all the carefully written speeches and dialogue, but his shtick gets tiring after a while. He suffers from the Omega Man syndrome one guy talking to himself is rarely interesting outside of the theatre, and his costars barely qualify as people (they're more like cardboard figures that offer repugnantly ignorant wisecracks). Of course the little robots are charming and almost have semblances of personalities, but all they do is waddle around, and if pressed, play cards and stitch up leg wounds.I'm not sure that the movie's logic is all sound. Evil capitalists in enviromental movies tend to do things like push a button to destroy all the forests in one shot, or dump toxic waste into the ocean in plain view of everyone. And so they do here. No reasons given, no rationalizations, no subtlety. One can imagine evil laughter after the radio clicks off (to the radio op's credit, he does lament with a brief  God help us all). As someone else suggested, why not just leave the forest bubbles in orbit? No, dispassionately nuking the forests is just so much more...evil.Pigs! (What if the dumb fatheads had to confront the ecological consequences of defoliation back on Earth? There would have been some dramatic possibilites.) Besides, the movie's full of bad science. Gravity in space? Every place on Earth being 75 degrees?I will say that where the movie does shine is in the production design department. Silent Running definitely does not scream early '70s visually, or any particular time period. It has the kind of austeure fuctional look you find in industry and the military. Doug Trumbull has always had a wonderful eye for timeless visual design and applies it well here, so a movie from 1971 looks as if it could just as easily have been made in 2001 (hehe). Speaking of which, it is too bad he didn't think to include any of his famous simulated computer graphics.Finally music Peter Schickele (the PDQ Bach guy) supplied most of the incidental music, which is not bad, if a little unusual for a movie. At the other end of the spectrum is Joan Baez's cooing the theme song over and over. The insrumental version under the opening credits actually tug at my heart strings; every time Joan sings along with it I start wishing that Trumbull had hired Grand Funk Railroad instead (Mark Farner, after all, was in his messaianic save-the-world phase at the time).All that said, when it all boils down, the movie has a payoff that makes the preceding 90-odd minutes worth it. The shot of the bubble floating off into deep space with the little robot critter watering whats left of Earth's plant life is enormously moving, even with Joan Baez singing under it. One wishes that the whole movie was as quietly and simply dramatic as that final scene.Final assessment a curio from a curious era in both filmmaking and environmentalism.

The robots are also precious and this was long before (by 5 years) R2D2 and C3PO taught the American public that we CAN feel some real emotions for mechanical characters. In fact, there is a scene where you just might find yourself getting a little misty eyed for a robot! I admit this while clutching what remains of my Italian-American macho self-image!Bruce Dern was marvelous! He plays the usual borderline psycho, but with the proverbial heart of gold. He means well....and you just might find yourself questioning your own morals and wondering if you would have done what he did in the movie. It will be a disturbing notion, especially once the end credits roll. You will sit there with your mouth open and numb. You will have to let it all soak in, my friend, and perhaps view it again after a few days to truly understand it all.One of the other haunting elements of this picture is the music! The most memorable being by Judy Collins! The song at the end is perfect. It is the purest example of music and film merging into perfection.The Director, Douglas Trumbell, did not go on to do as many great films as I thought he would after seeing this masterpiece, but he has done enough quality work to offset the quantity. For example, besides Silent Running, he was visual effects supervisor for Kubrick's amazing 2001 A Space Odyssey, special photographic effects supervisor for the all-time best sci-fi movie, BladeRunner and Speilberg's Close Encounter of the Third Kind! Some resume, huh?Please experience this movie and let me know what you think.

There's also an effort to make a convincing sci-fi movie without great resources and I was pleased to see that the 'drones' were only limited in their anthropomorphism, and could not communicate.Yet, the movie is terribly lumbering. Bruce Dern plays his role with a proselytising sincerity that belongs to the time, i.e. his intense, soft-n-slowly spoken lines are an anachronism. Above all, there's no sense in the movie of him taking a decision in the film, changing from being part of the contracted crew to becoming a maverick. His affiliation is with his radical, environment-at-cost-of-human conviction from the start.I like how the film's chapters are punctuated by Joan Baez's songs, keeping the temperament quite bold without forcing the pace.

All with some oh-so-serious Joan Baez corn to push it along (or fail to). Apart from the general concept, none of 3 writers has any idea how to structure 90 minutes with only one actor to contend with. Never has a character who needs to kill time, felt so much like a director needing to kill time. We get dramatically inert scenes of Dern telling the robots what their tasks are, and the most deadly unfunny comedy scene ever filmed in which Dern plays poker with two silent robots. And Dern is not the guy to build your movie around. Has there ever been a more literal, squirrelly actor? Don't miss his bizarre go-cart (time-killing) scene in which, to show enjoyment, he smiles like a pervert/cretin the whole time. The chintzy drones are not interesting, as they have nothing but circuitry to look at, and they manage to convince you, you could wheeze on them and they'd fall over. The dumb design doesn't even allow them to perform the one action the script calls upon them to perform (Sew up a wound). Apparently, they also failed at playing pool, in a scene that was deleted. !!??This is the weak movie you get when you have a director more interested in fx and gadgets than people.

This movie is one long heavy-handed social/political message. It's all about save the Earth, people are destroying the planet, etc, extreme environmentalist propaganda. Namely, in the movie people have destroyed literally all plant life on Earth through pollution and war, the only surviving plants are what is preserved on a space station in orbit. And only two people in the world care. To the extent that they decide to destroy these few remaining plants so they can use the space station for commercial service, i.e. they're going to destroy the last plants in existence because they're in the way of making a few dollars.2. The premise is seriously implausible. Does literally no one, anywhere in the world, have some seeds stashed away in a vault somewhere? Why are the last remaining plants kept in space rather than in some sealed location on the ground? If human beings have survived the wars and pollution, they must have some way to build rooms with breathable air, usable water, etc. Why can't they keep plants in such a room? And if we accept that for some reason these are really the last plants in the known universe, would people really callously destroy them? No explanation is given for doing this beyond one sentence that they want to return the station to commercial service, and apparently only two people in the world think this is a bad idea.The ending is equally implausible. I'm not going to give it away, but the hero is supposed to be an expert on plants, and yet, it takes him weeks? months? to realize that his plan to save these plants was fatally flawed because he hadn't considered one very basic requirement for all plant life.So okay, it's an implausible heavy-handed message movie for a cause that I don't particularly support, with a stupid ending. And yet ... I still thought it was a really good movie.For most of the movie there are just 4 characters the hero and his three robots. But the robots have more personality than most movie characters. They are just ... cute! When one of the robots must go outside the ship to make repairs, you really worry about his safety. And the interaction between the hero and the robots is wonderful.So the plot sucks, but the characters are great. It is definitely a movie worth watching.

Most of the special fx was well done. Some of them were positively awful.* Ecological Conscience Theme. I love the planet and the forests as much as everyone but I feel this theme would have been a lot more effective if they had exercised a little subtlety at some points. The heavy-handedness with regards to this was more than a tad overbearing at a couple of points.* Music. The score itself was good. The 2 songs in the movie made my ears bleed. On top of that the images in the film they accompanied created perhaps the worst cliched moments i could ever imagine. It wasn't as if you could just pretend you were deaf for a little and watch the scenes without the audio.. Together they were almost unbearable.

However, the order comes back that the crew needs to destroy all of the remaining flora and the caretaker, Lowell (Bruce Dern), decides to take matters into his own hands. Aside from the visual effects, which is the biggest thing this film has going for it, I will give credit to Bruce Dern for being a likable and somewhat charismatic lead, although I don't think he was quite up to task of carrying most of the film by himself. He had a certain humanity and earthiness that played well against the wordless drones that he interacts with. The other human cast members also did a good job, but they weren't really in it long enough for them to register too much as characters. As I said before, the visual effects were excellent. There were quite a few exterior space shots of the ships that I thought gave Star Wars a run for its money. There was also some decent production design on the ship interior. However, I do think that the film is a little dated. The songs were a little hokey and I didn't care for them too much. Also, the pro-environment message was laid on a little too broadly and came off as a little silly at times. Still, it is nice to see how far we've come considering that this came out towards the beginning of that movement.

The film imagines the dreadful prospect of a dystopian world that's bereft of wildlife and personality. It's well intentioned, prescient and chimes with contemporary environmental issues. This should be compelling, but it's just a drag.Silent Running takes place aboard a spaceship which has several domes containing an array of plants and wildlife. These are maintained by Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), a man whose strong views on ecology make him a pariah among the other crewmen. When Lowell's forestry is arranged to be destroyed by the powers that be, he reacts in a way that is, to understate, morally dubious.One of the main reasons why this is all such a drag is because we're given no depth, it isn't explained why Earth is a barren dystopia or why they're going to Saturn. You expect the crew members to imbue the film with substance however the character development is cut fatally short when Lowell blows them up early in the film. This plot development doesn't do many favours for the sole remaining character either, because as much as Lowell's indifferent and stupid colleagues annoyed me, did they really deserve to die? The film seems to justify their hurried dispatching, we're supposed to care for this drab murderer and his forest.One-man shows like 'Cast Away' require a good leading man in an extraordinary situation. The last one I saw was 'All Is Lost' with Robert Redford. It was the most extreme example of the genre I'd seen and was grossly overrated on the 'tomato-meter' at 94%, but the ambitious film just about worked for me.Silent Running gets neither an interesting lead character nor a compelling situation. Outside of an impassioned diatribe against his colleagues' indifference about the environment and the human condition, Lowell is a long faced, shaggy haired non-entity. Once he is the sole remaining homo-sapien, Lowell's only companions are three charisma bereft robots called Huey, Dewey and Louie (this is cute apparently), whose organs of communication are metal flaps that emit a quiet, meaningless sort of whistle.The supposed spectacle of Silent Running is also underwhelming. Director Douglas Trumbull worked on the special effects in '2001 A Space Odyssey', they're very much of their time in parts but nonetheless sensory and epic in scope. In Silent Running, however, the exterior shots of the spacecraft often look decidedly fake and miniature and the explosions are lamentably dated and intangible.I watched this film on Mark Kermode's recommendation, he loves this film, he considers it superior to 2001 and shockingly names it one of the greatest films ever made. He says that it's a human tale, that Dern's relationship with the robots is deeply affecting, I couldn't disagree more. The reason why Kermode likes it so much is because it's nostalgic for him, he saw at just 11- years-old and subsequently grew up loving the film &#x96; I've had similar attachment to films like Jaws, which is of course infinitely better.After a while I was willing for the film to end, I became entirely indifferent towards the narrative's dreary developments and the politics beneath them. I love nature and beautiful landscapes, I empathised with Lowell to a certain degree, however his actions make the film's message all rather muddled. Silent Running may appeal to Green extremists, however I think even they'll grow tired once they realise how little there is beyond its eco-friendly sentiment.50%www.hawkensian.com "},{"Title":"... but It's Dern that Stands Out","Date":"24 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" The film Silent Running provided the breakout role for its star, Bruce Dern. He'd been around in Hollywood a long time before doing a little of this and that before 'Running came along, and it would prove to be his delivery once and for all into the realm of A picture-opportunities that would capitalize on the widening of his eyes and the rising of his vocal chords to aptly remind audiences that he was on screen (the same attributes had been on hand in The Cowboys, the picture released four months earlier in which Dern costarred with John Wayne. In it, he was the only actor ever to kill the Duke in cinematic history). The film itself was merely an exercise for director Douglas Trumbull to stretch his limbs after a four-year hiatus that last saw him working with the master Kubrick on the greatest science fiction movie ever filmed. Trumbull was probably gnawing at the bit to instill into 'Running what he'd learned at the feet of Kubrick, but a modest budget was in play, so corners had to be cut to get the film produced (and one of them was casting Dern, a still relatively unknown commodity at the time). What's on screen is an economically streamlined shadow of Kubrick's masterpiece with a twist it's not machinery that's gone haywire but humankind's ability to value the nature it evolved from. Dern rolls through all of it with efficacy, stoically confronting the absolved apathy of shipmates as well as the steely edicts of corporate bosses to destroy what matters most to him. He's eloquently desperate while trying to keep the others on board from carrying out their disastrous orders in one scene and then effortlessly charming while playing poker with his compact shipboard robots in another. Dern certainly offers up a wide measure of emotions in a bravura performance that certainly was a standout among others in 1972.

As time goes on, Lowell struggles with his loneliness and his guilt over the murder, and must find out why his forest appears to be dying.Silent Running is one of those films that I've seen consistently mocked, homaged and referenced by other movies and programmes, but the film itself has always managed to elude me. Made around the time where people were starting to take notice of the eco-system and the fact that we may be slowly destroying the Earth with our acts, the film still packs a punch in the modern world that is all too aware of the threat of Global Warming. It does deliver a powerful ecological message, but the film is surprisingly more effective on a human level. Although Lowell seems to be on the verge of madness with his love for the beauty of nature, it is later in the film, when we see him lonely and missing humanity, that truly speaks volumes. Nature may be beautiful, but nothing is more comforting than human contact.Despite having a strong message, the film always avoids being preachy. It instead focuses on the mental instability of the protagonist, who spend the majority of the film existentially pondering if this lonely existence he has created for himself was really worth murdering three of his colleagues. The film is also profoundly moving. The three robots prove lovable characters, though they never speak or ever communicate properly on a human level. The threat of their demise also lingers, and when it inevitably happens it's almost appallingly moving, given that they are clearly just robot costumes (controlled by amputees, I must add).The film is no masterpiece by any means, but as a work of science- fiction, it is certainly brilliant. Back in the late 1960's and throughout the 1970's, sci-fi was inspired by ideas rather than special effects. The likes of Star Wars (1977) created a vast new world for it's audience to get lost in, and 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968), combined philosophy and mysticism to create a work of high art. The special effects maestro behind 2001, Douglas Trumbull, directs here, and uses the futuristic setting as a conduit to send a social message of the way our planet is heading, that is more profound than ever given our heightened awareness of our effect upon the planet.Special mention must go to Bruce Dern, who delivers a highly effective, if slightly over-the-top performance, as the angry and bewildered Lowell, who exists in a world where the Earth is scarred and devoid of plant life. This is original, innovative and surprisingly dark science fiction that manages to be both existential and entertaining. It's not perfect - the music is cheesy, the sets are very 1970's, Dern overacts to the extreme - but this is a cult favourite for a reason. It is simply a lovable film.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "}{"Title":"An adult environmental film in the vein of Moon","Date":"26 June 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Silent running is an achievement in story, character and visuals. If you like adult sci - fi films such as 2001, alien, sunshine and moon then you'll love this.The plot is that Earth has become barren and the last of earths forests are stored in huge ships and will be returned to earth when the planet is ready for them. Meanwhile these forests are maintained by four men and three Wall-E style drones. The forests are aboard frigates and are in huge glass domes (which look incredible by the way) and only one of the four men really cares for the forests and sees it as more than just a job. As the plot progresses only Derns character is left alone with the forests and the drones and a story of loneliness and courage unfolds. Bruce dern plays his character fantastically and has many sides to him, he has a very dedicated side to him which comes out when he is working. He has an aggressive side to him which emerges in various points through the film, and the most prevalent side to his character is the raw human side which his loneliness is channeled through. The other human characters are played as well as they can for the short time that they are in the film for and the sympathetic character is portrayed very well and in the climaxes of these three characters parts the acting and emotion is rather good. the three drones even manage to gain somewhat of a personality all of their own and become a lovable element to the film. The film is directed by Douglass Trumball, a wizard when it comes to models, and as expected this film looks brilliant, far better than most modern cgi. The frigate look clunky and metallic, like the nostromo from alien, on the outside yet on the inside is like the interior of Icarus from sunshine or the base in Moon. The forest may look a little sparse and there isn't much wildlife but that is not a major plot problem as it still looks good. The drones are very similar to Wall E but without the childish Disney element and they always look to a high standard.If you are a fan of serious sci - fi then if you have not seen silent running then you absolutely must as it is a very well made film.

The highlights were the surreal wonder of 2001, the fantastic absurdity of Space 1999 and the breathtaking, heartbreaking Silent Running. A world that solved poverty, disease & unemployment by turning itself into bland, synthetic socialism has placed all its national parks in orbit around Saturn in domes aboard chartered space freighters such as the Valley Forge, whose forests are watched over by embittered yet optimistic botanist Lowell (Dern, in the greatest role of his fine career). When inexplicably ordered to abandon & destroy the forests, Lowell commandeers the ship by staging an accident & taking the Valley Forge through Saturn's rings (one of Trumbull's matchless displays of special effects) into deep space with the last surviving forest. He's alone but for his desperate hope & the guilt of his betrayal, as well as a pair of maintenance drones that he nicknames Huey & Dewey & reprograms to become foresters & companions. Like most serious sci-fi films, Silent Running is plagued by some unresolved plot holes (why did Earth go to the trouble of shooting its forests into space if it didn't want them?) & ludicrous assumptions (all but the most clueless watcher will figure out why the forest is ailing long before the botanist does). But the detail flaws are insignificant compared to the unwavering theme of nature threatened by man's sublime arrogance, Dern's intense portrayal of his driven, tormented character & Trumbull's artful mix of story, science, props & effects. The drones are as imaginative as R2-D2, nearly as cute but longer on pathos & sympathy, especially the ever-dependable Dewey. Schickele's score & well-chosen songs from Baez set just the right mood for every scene. The contemporary Soylent Green shares the theme of one man fighting against a society unwittingly maiming itself by destroying nature. But Silent Running is truly unique, less dark & much more personal than Soylent, an unabashed environmental statement made both enjoyable & credible by its artfully told story. It set a standard that Star Trek The Next Generation often tried to match but never did without becoming cloying or preachy. Even if you drive a Hummer & own ten thousand shares of ExxonMobil, you'll wonder why no other film like this Hugo Award-winning masterpiece has ever been made.

Though not in the same league as Kubrick's 2001, Trumbull has fashioned a highly satisfying emotional story with an environmental message that transcends its hippie-era origins.This is a larger acheivement for Trumbull, who admits that he has been a misfit in Hollywood throughout his career, and laments that no other film projects have resulted with the same public admiration.  Dern also regards the film with the best in his career, and any naysayers might admit that Tom Hanks in CASTAWAY owes a debt to Dern, who pulled off a largely solo acting piece without chewing through the scenery.  The actors portraying the Drones deserve credit for their hard work, as does Peter Schickele for his lovely sparse score (if only the Joan Baez vocals could be removed!) Filmmakers might learn much from this film and the interviews--mostly in making the most of what they have.  The budget, according to Trumbull, was 1.3 million.

At least that is the plan; something Freeman Lowell has dedicated the last eight years of his life too. Then one day the fleet receives an order; they are to destroy the domes containing the forests and return to Earth. Lowell is devastated but the other three men in the crew are just glad to be going home. As they start destroying the domes Lowell decides that he will save one of them; even if it means murdering his colleagues! Once they are dead he tells the rest of the fleet that they are having problems before taking the ship out of radio contact behind Saturn. With only three robotic drones for company he must look after the forest and the ship.This ecological sci-fi film may not have great special effects and the sets don't exactly look real but it is easy to over look those faults and enjoy the story. Bruce Dern does a fine job as Lowell; playing him in a way that makes the viewer wonder whether he is a good man doing what it takes to save the last plants or whether the realisation that the last eight years may have been for nothing has driven him insane. The three drones; which he dubs Huey, Dewey and Louie are suitably cute without being anthropomorphised. There is nothing unsuitable in the film but I suspect younger viewers may be put off by the relatively slow pace and lack of action... and by the fact that there is only one human character for much of the film. Douglas Trumbull did a fine job directing this... especially considering the fact that it was his directorial debut and the budget was fairly modest. Overall I'd say this may not be a masterpiece but it is still well worth watching.

I sat down expecting early 70s special effects, but hopefully a decent story. I got neither. Bruce Dern plays an environmental astronaut who, with his three astronaut buddies, are caring for the last plants and animals, encased in domes, that used to inhabit the now sterile(?) earth. (I put a question mark after sterile because we're not told what happened to earth, but left to wonder. A nuclear holocaust, perhaps?) After given orders from earth to destroy the domes, because the space craft are needed for commercial purposes again, Dern's character embarks on a somewhat deranged quest to save them. There are many problems with this film. Douglas Trumbull, who was the special effects wizard on 2001 - A Space Odyssey, (and also directed the film) fails miserably in Silent Running. Whereas, in 2001 we gawked at the realism of the sfx, the ones in Silent Running are laughable. The spaceships look like they were constructed from Legos. Their interiors are also poorly done, particularly the main control room which is mostly made up of cheap-looking monitors and oscilloscopes, though granted their budget was a minuscule $1 million. The explosions in space are heard (unlike 2001 where space is rightly silent) and Freeman (Dern's character) walks on the outside of his ship without any tethers. The acting is stiff and the script trite. Though I enjoy Joan Baez's singing, her songs are jarring and destroy what little atmosphere there is in the movie. The best characters, ironically, are the three drone robots who do maintenance on the ship and eventually assist Freeman with his mutiny. Silent Running tries to make a statement about 70s environmentalism, but fails in just about every area.

Few answers.First question - why were these spacecraft containing Earth last forests on spacecraft out near Saturn?  Would it not make more sense to have them in the same orbit as Earth where the sunlight would be the same as on Earth? Near Saturn space probes have to be nuclear powered because the sunlight is so weak out that far out to power even low voltage systems let alone keep a forest alive. The last forest dome was dying half way thru the movie for lack of sunlight. Logic would dictate that they should have started dying long before that, in fact, they should have started dying as soon as they got out past Mars.Second - (many people mention this) why blow up the forests at all? So, the budget for the program was cut? Why not link the domes together, release them in the same orbit as Earth in case they change their minds?Third - How in the world could they allow an econut psycho into the space program to begin with? Any nut case who would murder his fellow man to save trees is one can short of a six pack, one fry short of a happy meal, one whose elevator does not go all the way to the top, ect. His attitude is Gee, sorry I killed you there, dude, but I had to save the trees so they could float around in deep space for a thousand years like an ecological Flying Dutchman.Fourth - in the end a second rate R2D2 ancestor is in charge of keeping the last forest alive for as long as the supplies and power in the dome last? How long would that be? A few months or years? No one else knew the thing was out there in deep space! I guess when you are a psycho econut, things like that do not cross your mind.The most interesting part was the arming, launch and detonation sequence and the part at the end where Bruce went kaboom!  As I recall they later used these 3 ships in Battlestar Galactica as farming ships. (they are actually doing a new miniseries on December 2003 which made me think of it)  I believe the dome concept was also used for the series The Starlost a year later (great concept, horrible execution).I am all for keeping forests in decent shape but this was a ham handed way of making the point about keeping our forests and planet in decent shape. It makes environmentalists look like nutcases- like groups such as Earth First (I think Bruces character would have been elected President of the group for his killing off his fellow crewmen).Still, for some strange reason, I still watch this movie every so often.

The earth has become denuded of all natural habitat and humans now consume chemically produced food. Dern's crewmates even find the smell of natural fruit offensive. So when the order comes to jettison the precious cargo and destroy what remains of humankind's natural environment, Dern mutinys, killing his fellow crewmembers and commandeering the one ecoship still carrying its ecodome. Under cover of storm and with the assistance of his three droids, `Hughey, Dewey and Louie,' Dern escape the fleet of ecoships.

In both versions, Dern is overtaken by the other ecoships, and blows up his ship after first releasing the precious cargo to be tended by one of the droids. However, in the original version, Dern takes the rest of the fleet with him, thus ensuring there would be no one around to destroy the last remaining ecodome. The new ending is a copout, Dern's death a sign of cowardice rather than the self-sacrifice (albeit a homicidal one) . If this is the way it was nationally released, no wonder the film tanked at the box office. I'm basing my review on a laser disc version. Hopefully, the recent dvd version with commentaries restores the original ending. Production values are quite good. Filmed aboard a moth-balled aircraft carrier `Silent Running' has the genuine feel of a cramped space environment. Special effects are nearly on par with `200l,' not surprising, since producer-director Doug Trumball created the special effects for both films. Dern at first seems an odd choice, but he acquits himself well in one turns out to be, essentially, a one man show. He is ably assisted by the handicapped actors inside the droids. As portrayed by these actors, the droids are incredibly charming and are, undoubtedly, the inspiration for R2D2. In a world where we are using radioactive waste (DU) to make antitank shells and firing them into cities, `Silent Running' seems even more  timely AND MORE NEEDED than in 1972. See it.

The main character, Lowell Freeman, with the aid of some interesting droids he affectionately names Huey, Duey and Louey, seems to be the only person left who cares about the fate of what remains of Earths natural foliage. This precious cargo has been kept safe inside giant domes mounted on board three specially constructed space vessels.Because of the worlds population, which seems to have become too complacent with it's way of life, an order is sent to the crews to jettison all the pods and then destroy them with nuclear detonations. It is left to Lowell Freeman to stand alone and attempt to salvage as much as he is able. In doing so he is forced to cause the deaths of his three colleagues, and it enters him into an even greater dilemma, because to him all life is precious.The respite he gains for the cargo is only short-lived however as he is pursued by a rescue ship, so he decides to program two of the droids to maintain the last remaining pod, which he launches it into space. Guilt ridden with what he has done to his fellow shipmates and the futility of the situation he sets the ship to self destruct, ending his own life, his only comfort is the remaining and damaged droid that he kept with him. Interesting to note that the droids were actually manned by acrobats contorted into position, inside the shells of Huey Duey & Louey, and walking on their hands.

It has a lot of redeeming qualities and a generally good story that are hampered by several major hiccups.First, the soundtrack is jarring as hell. If they had went with something more traditional, rather than using JB and her hippy vibe, I think this film might still be watched by a larger portion of people today like 2001 still is (rather than just having a cult following). As it stands, the music is a little too out of place and really highlights the environmentalism in the film. While being an environmentalist myself, I don't consider this a bad thing, but I hate films that are in the audience's face with their moral judgments and hidden agendas. I don't need X director's or Y writer's values shoved down my throat (even if I happen to agree with them) to enjoy a film&#x97;it's quite the opposite. If you've got a message, then find a smart and subtle way to get it across. I don't watch movies to be preached to, I watch them to be entertained, and sometimes, even moved. In SR's case, the agenda is far from hidden, and because of that I think it may turn off a portion of the public who watches it. If a remake is ever done of this film, the soundtrack needs better attention.Second, the script. There are a lot of problems here. Why so far out from the sun? Why would you want plants that far away from what gives them life? And why were they ordered to proceed with the nuclear detonations? I'm sorry, but, blow 'em up and come home, and we've got no explanation why is just extremely lazy writing. And the crew&#x85;why are they so dismissive and bitter towards nature? I know lots of people on both sides of the environmental fence, but NONE of them have such disdain for the natural beauty and importance of nature as these three do. Also, once reworked to make the characters more believable, I think this dynamic should have been explored more. I think all the characters should have been developed better, and maybe even working a little sympathy into the three crewmen that want to go home. That way, we could really feel Freeman Lowell's insanity as he goes into his homicidal meltdown. Also, I would have liked to have seen a more methodical killing of his three shipmates, as well as a great deal of remorse from Lowell after they were gone (play off of the double-standard that Lowell respects life, yet he had to take life to preserve it). As it stands, the script is workable, it would just need some major rewrites for a remake.Overall, I think SR is a film that is more than the sum of it's parts, and that's why I gave it a seven rather than a six or even a five. The ship models are realistic in design, the ship interiors are serviceable (although not nearly as convincing as the Nostromo's or Discovery's), the little robots are cute without going overboard, and the idea of removing the last elements of nature from earth to save them is believable more than ever. I just think this film could be so, so much more, and that's why I am in favor of a remake.

Gee, how'd they do that?, or that it wasn't divided into 10 different parts made over 50 years where part 7 comes first, then part 2, then, etc. in order to intrigue us with its supposed timelessness.True science fiction is an odyssey of the mind, and is a way of forcing us to question the human condition in a unique way.  Unfortunately, it's become light sabers, outrageous special effects makeup, and computer-generated special effects which always look like...computer-generated special effects. Another thing that makes some of the reviewers uncomfortable about this film is that there is no clear division between good and evil.  Most seem the need to have this explained to them so that there is no mistake as to who the bad guys really are (I give you Star Bores and the new Star Trek).In Silent Running, you have no clue as to what is going to happen, even after the rest of the crew is dispatched.  You always know the good guys are going to win in the more modern blockbusters (read trash), and thrilled by special effects wizadry (read it's such expensive stuff, you gotta like it, no matter how bad it really is, or what little it does for the story).  Bruce Dern was fantastic in this movie, and he is excellent in conveying the feelings being felt by the hero (antihero?) of the story.

The movie has a lot going for it. To begin with, there's a performance from Bruce Dern that is worthy of comparison with Gene Hackman's Oscar-winning performance that year in a way the other nominees simply were not. He provides a passionate and intelligent performance in which he is hardly ever off-screen and makes the viewer share his anger at the treatment of his mission. Then, too, there is the rarity of a science-fiction film which does not attempt to overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary special effects &#x96; one in which the drama is driven by the character and the scarily believable story. If you are looking for a film about environmental concern that works on every level, then forget about Al Gore's worthy but dull contribution and watch this beautifully-realised film.

Today, however, is when I saw the movie, and it's sad for me to see how much of the film hasn't aged very well. Not so much all of the special and visual effects; most of the exterior space shots and the repetitive (sometime too repetitive) shots of the Valley Forge ship drifting along, as well as that quick and trippy thrill-ride through the Saturn rings, are very well done for its time and work for the sake of the movie's own reality of sorts. Just little things, like, say, all of the Joan Baez songs, which screeches the mood to a halt with its hippy-dippy flavor (unless, of course, you're into that sort of thing).That, and the fact that it being Douglas Trumbull's first film as a director (he's a well-deserved Oscar nominee for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and has his name proudly stamped forever on 2001 and Blade Runner as a special effects man), and whether it was his call or that of the director of photography, Charles F. Wheeler, to shoot a lot of the interiors like it was for television (sometimes they're creative with it, but for the most part it's almost too basic for its own good). So, there are things like that, and a few little scenes (mostly early on with character actors Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin and Jesse Vint) that fall flat. And yet... this is definitely, when it's at its best, one of the most unusual and curious pieces in the genre from the period, or maybe any. Taking aside the pro-environment message of the film, it's a really excellent story about a man going over that certain edge, and being possessive of the very thing that should be shared with the world.It's a complex character that the writers, Cimino, Bochco and Washburn have created here with Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), so much so that he's both very complex and too simple-minded to figure on. He loves his forest and his trees, worked on it for 8 years, and is told at the drop of a dime to let it all go and the plans for repopulating the Earth with actual greenery is done with, and it's back to a pat return to 75-degree all-the-time normalcy. He snaps, kills his co-pilots, and tries his best to break off contact with his boss ships. And yet there's a level of loneliness seen as the film develops, a struggle with himself not being a bad person but one who's torn up from what he's done. All he has, apparently, are three strange, almost kinda cute robots he names Huey, Dewey and (after the fact of losing him around Saturn's rings) Louie, who do tasks all over the ship.What the film lacks in directorial polish, therefore, is made-up in spades by the wonderful story and this character who, for 2/3 of the movie, is the only human we see on screen. It's so crucial then that the one consistently brilliant aspect is Bruce Dern's performance. He's an actor of incredible depth when called upon to action in the right part, and here he gives one of the best he had to offer in his prime period. He is so precise at going between subtlety, rage, bewilderment, amusement (i.e. poker game w/robots), sadness and shame, that he commands the screen every time he's on; even when he's put into a ridiculous bit walking outside of the ship in his blue suit walking normally- maybe the lamest moment of the movie- he does interesting stuff. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it was one of the best performances of that year, which had the likes of Brando and Pacino and Olivier to contend with. Now if only the rest of Silent Running, a very good but spotty film of and for its time, held up so well. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"One of the very great Sci-Fi films.","Date":"11 July 2007","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Many Directors have been quick to label their own genius with works such as 2001 A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner when, in fact, the genius belongs to their Special Effects Art Director Douglas Trumbull. It can be argued, and many have, that Trumbull is probably the most important figure in modern Sci-Fi, creating the dark world of Blade Runner, the impressive but ultimately sterile Universe in 2001 and the awe-inspiring UFO scenes in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But what many don't know is that Trumbull directed his own Sci-Fi film in 1972 named Silent Running. Given a relatively low budget, in comparison to 2001 and his later work Blade Runner, Trumbull would prove that the best work comes from people who have to make do with what little they have.Silent Running bequeaths the tale of a future Earth extinct of any plant life, with only a very few specimens having been saved in gargantuan space-bound greenhouses attached to a fleet of Space Freighters (the 'American Airline' of its day). These ships stay residing just outside the orbit of Saturn until Earth needs them back to reforest the planet. Bruce Dern, who plays Freeman Lowell, the appointed Head Gardner of the greenhouse-in-space, would rather spend time feeding his bunnies than hang out with his knucklehead crew. Well, unless there is a chance of embarrassing them at a game of Poker. However, when orders come in to nuke the remaining greenhouses and become a commercial airline once again, Lowell decides he would rather see his crew dead than watch the last remaining pieces of nature go into the light.What's truly amazing about Silent Running is how anti-sci-fi it is. Yes, there are some stunning visuals and it certainly looks to be a sci-fi movie, but ultimately this is a story about human beings. This is not the logic based evolutionary wanderings of 2001, neither does it have the philosophical vitality of Blade Runner or The Matrix. Silent Running is not concerned if the reality we are waking up to is in fact another form of illusion, or pondering about what makes us truly human. No, Silent Running is about a relatively simple person in an unremarkable situation. Lowell's basic choice is &#150; do I want human beings to survive, or my garden? He opts for the latter. There are too many human beings, anyway. But as the movie goes on Lowell finds that, although he can only find alienation with his own kind, he can't help but miss them.In fact, he misses them so much that his robot workers now go by the human names of Huey, Dewey and Louie. Notice I use the term 'robot' very loosely there. Due to Trumbull's budget what we in fact have are brightly coloured microwaves with rubber-gloved feet. But, my God, are they the most humanised robots ever depicted on screen. On first glance gentle snickering maybe heard from the back of your mind, but as time passes you grow so attached and loving towards these boxes that, when Lowell accidentally runs one over, it's as if your own son has been named road kill. This is such an amazing feature of Directing from Trumbull. Let's face it, anyone can make a robot seem more human when you cast humans as the robots. (Though, I did wonder whether Harrison Ford was in fact the Tin Man in Blade Runner). Trumbull intelligently creates a robot where the audience, as well as Lowell, have to project their own feelings, desires & hopes onto it, refraining from producing a fully formed and packaged robot for the viewer to consume blindly.But if you want to know why Silent Running truly works, then I'll tell you. It's the first and only sci-fi film that you will make you weep. No, not in the sense of Star Wars where you cry for the dim-witted romanticism, but where you actually break down in tears for the emotion shown on screen. This is not a dry, academic, logical maze that you have to weave yourself through, but a journey which you experience and learn from. Notice, I could have highlighted how Silent Running was ahead of its time due to it's forward-thinking ideas about nature and how we must always try to preserve it, if really only for it's unparallelled beauty. But I didn't. At the end of the day Silent Running is a treatise on the evil that we humans do to the planet. But, ironically, what makes this one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time is that it's not about spectacular visuals or interesting, dry technology, but about being so uniquely human.The end scene shows Lowell releasing his Garden from the space ship so the incoming Mother Ship cannot find the bodies of the people he has killed, and Lowell says to his friendly robot, in an almost Shakespearian tone, When I was a kid, I put a note into a bottle, and it had my name and address on it. I threw the bottle into the ocean. I never knew if anyone ever found it. With that Lowell triggers a bomb, sending himself in to the light, whilst the one remaining robot tends the love of his life, his garden, which floats quietly into the netherworlds of space. Will anyone out there ever find it?

When the first red flag of Something Not Making Sense happens in the first 10 minutes of a film, you just know that it's going to go downhill from there.This is going to contain spoilers left and right, so consider yourself warned.Freeman Lowell (Dern) is... a groundskeeper?  A conservation agent? Either way, he's on a spaceship called Valley Forge, along with three other... astronauts?  Janitors?  No one's job is made clear.  There are also three Drones.  Anyway, they're all on this ship.  There are other ships, too, and biodomes on each ship.  For some reason, there aren't any forests or anything on Earth, but that's never explained.  An Executive Order to jettison the biodomes and destroy them is issued.  Why the people had to nuke the domes isn't issued, but it pushes Lowell over the edge, and he turns into HAL 9000, except, you know, crappy.There were no bad parts in the movie except the story and Joan Baez.  The story is just stupid.  No explanations are given for, say, destroying the biodomes on ships that were apparently designed to house biodomes because there aren't any forests left on Earth, for example.  When that's your main character's primary motivation, it's kind of important to understand why. Maybe it's just me, though.The special effects clearly lead the way to Star Wars, and the acting is decent.  The cinematography, however, just SCREAMS I saw a French New Wave movie once.

With the exception of some completely annoying and dated songs by Joan Baez, SILENT RUNNING has a very interesting story and moral attached to it, something that some people do not notice, mainly because most people think the movie 's moral has to do with Freeman Lowell 's belief that the forests are important toward saving Earth. It is not avoiding the fact that the maintenance robots are what sold the movie in the first place. They were cute, funny, they interacted with emotion, what else is there not to like about them? SILENT RUNNING is as close to original science fiction you can get. I would not recommend it to a novice, since its decent acting takes the genre away from what people usually see in such films as this bad acting with plenty of fun.In the future; forests, vegetation, rabbits, birds, etc. are now raised or grown in domes on ships in outer space. Earth simply is too overpopulated to have room for them. The order is given to destroy all the forest domes. On one ship, a crew member, Freeman Lowell becomes psychotic learning that the precious forests would be destroyed. He kills his fellow crew members, takes the ship into hiding and tries to raise the vegetation himself with the maintenance droids.Once Freeman realizes how lonely 'out there' really is by himself is where SILENT RUNNING really shines. The film takes steps to make sure we know what he is feeling. And with every realization Freeman gets, we know exactly what he is feeling and understand the moral all the better. That type of science fiction acting is hard to find these days, especially with modern science fiction scripts pumping out garbage such as INDEPENDENCE DAY and EVENT HORIZON. SILENT RUNNING will remain a forgotten classic science fiction film, with a good reputation.

Why this is, I cannot say. Perhaps because I was 9 when I first saw it and anything sci-fi was good and now I'm older and wiser. I don't know.For a start it has Bruce Dern as the main character, Lowell. A slightly weird individual, Lowell is in charge of managing the last forests on (or rather, off) Earth. Quite why they couldn't build the biodomes ON the Earth and not go to the expense of boosting them into space is beyond me. Anyway, Lowell is slightly nuts, and Dern plays that aspect very well. However, Dern's acting sucks for the most part.Then there are the droids...basically cyclopean bread bins with legs. I never understood how they could build these things with legs, but couldn't, apparently, give them arms. Instead they have some sort of appendage that wouldn't look out of place on a deep sea recovery submersible. And why legs? Lowell and his buddy's hurtle through the starship in little buggies, whilst the droids totter along at 1 mph in their wake. Surely wheels or tracks would be more useful?Anyway, the whole Save the Plants project gets axed by Earth and Lowell goes nuts and offs his companions to save the trees. Then he's alone, with Earth demanding an answer to what's happened.There are some genuinely funny moments, like Dern teaching the droids to play cards. But on the whole the film has too many holes. Another well made point here is why shoot the domes off and then nuke them. Why destroy them at all? Just space the contents and keep the domes.And why, when he sends one of the droids off in the last dome, to keep the plants safe forever, does he not allow the remaining, damaged droid, to go with it? Instead he keeps the battered droid with him to share his nuclear death.All-in-all a post flower power era movie that tries to point out our folly in neglecting the planet (but never shows the planet let alone just how bad things are supposed to be) and what one dedicated man tries to do to save it.In the end, all it makes me think about now is how being alone for too long in space can drive someone nuts.

I've seen other reviews and comments which appear to suggest that Bruce Dern's acting was overlooked for an Oscar nod. My lord, 1972 must have been a bad year if that performance needed overlooking. At its best, it was wooden and stilted, and at its worst it looked like Will Ferrell's visual inspiration for Ricky Bobby in Talledega Nights.I was completely disengaged with the film; perhaps my green credentials aren't strong enough, or perhaps the fundamental basis for the plot setup wasn't sufficiently well explained, but I agreed with the rest of the crew on the Valley Forge - Lowell was just barking mad! Once Lowell's violent actions had taken place, that was just reinforced - instead of sacrificing just the forest, he'd set himself on a path where he lost his humanity too.Of course, 40 year old films such as this can't be judged in terms of the special effects by today's standards.

It tells the story of Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), scientist and environmentalist aboard the American Airlines space ship Valley Forge in a future where the only remaining examples of Earth's natural ecosystems now exist in numerous domes on the Valley Forge and two other ships. They were shot off into space to preserve them as Earth became entirely technology covered and climate controlled.Lowell has been with the ship since the project began 8 years ago, while his three crewmates are in the midst of their one year tour of duty, and he's convinced they're going to receive an order to return the forests, deserts and other plant and animal life to Earth. The order they actually receive is to destroy the habitats and return the three ships to commercial service. That's an order that Lowell can't obey and can't let the others carry out.I don't know if I've ever seen another film where the hero is portrayed as an arrogant, self-righteous scold while the villains are portrayed as ordinary guys who just want ordinary things. Lowell is a character right out of Rush Limbaugh's most fevered dreams - an environmentalist who cares more about plants and animals than people, who cares more about humanity in abstract than he does other human beings. The movie never sugarcoats the misanthropic aspects of Lowell's personality or the drastic nature of his actions, but there's no moral judgment made of them. When, later on in the story, Lowell comes to regret what he did, it's shown as a result of personal guilt and loneliness, not out of some sense of objective wrongness.Silent Running touches on Lowell still needing other human beings, even though he feels betrayed by and alienated from them. He turns the ships robot drones into his friends, talking to them and reacting to them like they were people. It's even intimated that the robots are more than just mindless machines, but it's never made clear what that is supposed to mean.Silent Running stands out as a message move made before its message became too caught up in political and cultural warfare. It's strongly pro-conservation and anti-development in a philosophical, rather than a utilitarian way. Lowell loathes the antiseptic, artificial world of the future, even though it's a future without war, poverty or disease. The movie really makes no effort to argue for the preservation of the wilderness. It's just assumed that such preservation is an unquestioned good. This movie predates the decades of environmental arguments that have pitted conservatives against liberals. There's no political or partisan tinge to Silent Running, and the people who are going to destroy the habitat domes are never anything but folks who just want to do a job and get back home. It's Lowell that is portrayed as being angry and selfish.It's a little odd to think of a pro-environment sci-fi movie that has two full blown, Joan Baez hippie music montages as being carefully thoughtful about the issue. But Silent Running never falls into the trap of propaganda and allows noble ends to obscure dirty, human means. Maybe that's because the environmental movement of its day hadn't faced much organized, ideological opposition. Perhaps the film is best understood as a remnant from an era when an awakening concern for the Earth was still something that was considered normal for anyone and not a fetish for tree huggers or eco-terrorists.I also have to remark on this film being G-rated, even though it has three murders and a suicide in it. What has happened to the film rating standards from the days when Silent Running and the even more violent Battle for the Planet of the Apes could be considered G-rated family entertainment, while today they'd only be a few cuss words away from PG-13? Is it because sci-fi movies used to be considered so unrealistic that nothing in them could be taken seriously? Or did we at some point decide that death was something children needed to be almost completely sheltered from? When's the last time anyone made a G-rated movie, live action or cartoon, where multiple people get killed?

Believing he is lost from his fleet Lowell goes a little stir crazy.  It is when contact is regained with his fleet that Freeman Lowell realizes what he has done and has become.Silent Running has some interesting moments, my favourite being a card game with 2 of the drones, but for the most part just tells its simple story.  There's not much adventure involved in the movie and little time is spent on it's main plot point, that being Lowell saving the last dome containing the remains of Earth's forests.  Perhaps what the film makers wanted to get across is that one man alone cannot save the world...who can say for sure.Overall Silent Running is a interesting enough movie.  It's more enjoyable to figure out the movies other non-environmental messages then it is to dwell too much on it.  Silent Running is dated but it's not too bad to watch.  Joan Baez's songs are very dated, sound horrible and are pretty much laughable.  Also, it's effects, if you keep in mind Silent Running was made over 30 years ago, are passable.Silent Running rates a 5 out of 10.

The opening credits seem to have been made in the late 80's rather than early 70's as was the case. The style of the set design and costumes are clearly the model for space opera set design for years afterward. Douglas Trumbull and crew were the best at the time and had they only tried as hard on the plot as they did on the ambience of the film they would have had a classic.So give them a break already. Though there seem to be inconsistencies in the storyline many of the film's plot quirks can be explained by remembering that this was an alternate twist on reality, or as I like to say, it's just a movie. This was not the world we all expected to live in, but where it may have been headed. This is the quintessential 70's Sci-fi theme. Sometimes this leads to absurd points of view. Omega Man, Soylent Green, Logan's Run are all completely absurd, but no one pokes holes in them because they are clearly fantasy. 1984 is rediculous in some places, but no one would ever dare to strike down the whole of it. Silent Running should be treated no differently. The point is made and made well, that mankind values comfort above all else and that the natural environment which he sees as hostile, and dangerous is most probably doomed. The domes which house the last of earth's delicate ecosystems are kept far from earth tethered to freighters which the company is anxious to see put back into regular service. The crew of the freight ships is miserable at having to babysit the forests and yearns to return to an Earth where everywhere you go it is 70 degrees. Lowell is not the last conservationist, not the last gardener, but the last MAN. His humane treatment of the forests makes him the only human aboard, for the others have lost their humanity. Note that Lowell eats real food. The others eat synthetic biscuits. The others play mindless games to while away the hours while Lowell plants more flowers. And if that wasn't enough Joan Baez sings of Children running wild in the forests to hammer home the point.Yes , the thing with the dying forest is totally a plot killer, and it's unnecessary. Blowing up the domes, why wouldn't they, they're destroying the forests cause they don't want to spend another dime on them, and otherwise they would be so much space junk to run into later, why not blow them up and give the people of Earth a thrill. How do you know they weren't filming for a reality TV show. And the robot who Lowell leaves in charge, how long could he last? He can repair himself, fix anything and perhaps build little friends to keep the line going, but I hope they had a mulcher of some kind.

I had put off seeing it for a long time, but now I'd finally found both the time and the mood.Unfortunately I wasn't very impressed with it. For a 1972 movie it is very well produced, and has an environmental message at a time when this sort of thing may have been prevalent in science fiction books, but hadn't really reached the general population. So it was progressive for its time, and the effects and spaceship models are not bad at all.As for the story; apparently these three spaceships (which for no apparent reason are out in the vicinity of Saturn) contain the very last Terran trees at all, and nobody except our somewhat over-zealous protagonist cares? In fact, a message comes from Earth to just destroy these last bits of original nature? That seems extremely silly at first. But okay, I guess this was to show that Earth and its people had become far removed from nature, esp. in a moral sense. Alienated from their true natural selves. They had lost the beauty. Exiled it. And would now destroy the last remaining bit of it. Yes, all right, it does make sense on a non-literal level. Our hero ends up sacrificing himself to preserve the last bit of beauty that exists, keeping alive the hope that it could one day be rediscovered. In this way, the movie is an apocalyptic or even post-modern tale, describing how we are losing our deepest and most important values. I guess it works. As an attempt at an art movie.Unfortunately the execution leaves a lot of credibility to be desired. The situations often seem ludicrous, and Bruce Dern's acting is as ham-fisted as the overt ecological message is heavy-handed. The storytelling in and of itself doesn't ring true, and a hundred little details just don't work. Like, when the ships have gone through the Saturnian rings and the plants inexplicably start dying. Any botanist tending arboretums far out in the solar system could scarcely fail to be aware, before he even left Earth, that plants need a certain amount of sunlight, which isn't going to be there if you move the ships too far out into the solar system. That Lowell hadn't thought of this demonstrates a serious failing on the part of the movie's writer - and there's still no reason the ships would be out by Saturn (where light is scarce) in the first place.So a few rather important shortcomings certainly mar this movie. Generally, I can't regard it as much of a sci-fi classic, although a bunch of the effects and models are very nice indeed.6 out of 10. I would like to award it a higher grade, but I can't.

Anyway, that explains why everybody discuss of the scientific values of the movie. Let be clear  There is no scientific plots in this movie ! It's a TALE ! Like Alice in Wonderland, where nobody thinks to tell us A rabbit can't talk ! This is a scientific nonsense !Who cares the evil capitalistics didn't need to nuke the forrest ? This is just a conventional point of view to build a story, not the center of the story. For me the story talks about a man who becomes mad because of his loneliness, and think he is God.First, Lowell is alone in a psychologic matter. As someone said  he's the last man alive, even when his team mates are alive. And I add my own precision  The last forrest dome, is the last world !. So, Lowell feels very big responsibilities toward this world. He works on it. This forrest becomes his creation (Lowell lets the other domes being destroyed, but refuses to let the evils touching his own world).Second, Lowell is so lonely when his team mates are dead, that he creates new friends ! That explains another scientific question frequently asked  Why the drones have no wheels, no real arms and don't talk ? This is because originally, these drones are not robots for protocol ! They are specialized tools to mend the spaceship, that's all. They are things, not beeings. But Lowell modifys them. As he says  Now, you'll work for me guys !. He teached them to become surgeons, poker players, gardeners, and so on... and he gave them a personality and human names. These drones are HIS creation, like the last forrest.Do you begin to understand where I want to go ? Eden's gardens, two creatures.... Mmmm.... A bible genesis alike, no ? (Too bad he didn't name Adam and Eve his last two drones). And like God, he gave his creation to his creature and disappeared.So the environementalist theme is not very important, this is the psychological draft of a lonely man who becomes crazy and think (unconsciousnessly) he's God. The best similar reference to recommend is DARK STAR by John Carpenter with a similar ending  SPOILER ALERT the lonely computer-bomb finished to think he was God and said Let there be light ! (hopping to create a world by exploding).In SILENT RUNNING, the lack of action scenes is a good thing, because that gives us time to think. MATRIX, for example, had religious background too, but who cares ? We are flooded with action scenes, no time to think ! (particulary in sequel 2 and 3). So the slow action gives to this movie his beauty. And, after all, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, have no jumping action scenes either. It's still a masterpiece.SILENT RUNNING is also a masterpiece.

Unfortunately this is possibly the highlight of the movie.I mean no disrespect to fans of this film - and to prove that I am not some 14 year-old who can only name the latest Hollywood SFX blockbuster, let me say there are plenty of SF movies from the early 70's or even late 60's which I find very worthy and quite watchable today. The original 'Planet of the Apes' still works. '2001', needless to say, but more forgotten movies, too. 'Soylent Green' still actually packs a punch today, and even 'The Andromeda Strain', despite being incredibly dry and quite slow, is tension filled. And of course I love 'Dark Star', which in retrospect almost seems like a parody of this movie at certain times - but for the life of me I cannot understand how so many people can be so fond of 'Silent Running', which to me is almost completely awful.I don't even know where to start listing its problems. The lead character, who I suspect is supposed to come across as some sort messianic environmentalist hero, is clearly unhinged even in the earliest scenes, and coupled with Dern's excruciating over-acting, it's hard to feel any sympathy for him as he rants and raves at his crewmates who race over his garden in a scene that looks like it was heavily influenced by The Banana Splits Show. Later he rants and raves whenever anyone basically mentions the word 'tree' or nature' or 'the', and you end up feeling sorry for his crewmates for having to put up with someone who is clearly a dangerous maniac.Other than this, the movie proceeds at a terrible crawl - thank God it's less than 90 minutes long. There are silly waddling droids, which I gather actually contain real-life double amputees. The scenes involving them which are supposed to be touching and pathetic are - I'm sorry - borderline funny. Meanwhile Dern's character, apparently the world's foremost expert on botany, displays his expertise in the field by not realising that plants need sunlight to photosynthesize. In the meantime Joan Baez sings a couple of embarrassing nature ballads that might have worked on Sesame Street. Oh yes, and they have this futuristic 8-ball game where a gigantic, unwieldy robotic arm picks the balls up and racks them up in the frame. It takes about 30 seconds to do each ball. Why someone doesn't just knock it out of the way and do it themselves is anyone's guess.Meanwhile the central character goes slowly madder, while he continues to do a series of completely uninteresting things.I decided to watch this film partly because of h4 good reviews here. I want to do my part to try to make sure somebody else doesn't suffer the same fate as me.

Basically in the distant future planet plant life on Earth has become extinct, now all flora and fauna from the planet's ecosystem exists and is preserved in space freighters with giant greenhouse like domes, the Valley Forge is one of those American Airline controlled space stations. On the Valley Forge, botanist and ecologist Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern, Laura's father) loves all the forest plants and creatures that inhabit in, he is one of a four men crew, he cares for the life before it will eventually return to Earth for reforestation, but the crew receive news that the pods will all be jettisoned and destroyed in space, while the rest of the crew rejoice going back home Lowell is devastated. Lowell is forced to follow orders, and he allows the crew to jettison four of the six domes, but he cannot bring himself to allow any more to be destroyed, so he rebels to save the plants and animals on the ship, he kills one crew member who was due to plant explosives, and he traps the other two crew members in another dome to be jettisoned and blown up. Lowell is alone with the plants and animals to care for by himself, but he does have the aid of three service droid robots, or drones, who he calls Huey (Drone 2), Dewey (Drone 1) and Louie (Drone 3), and to make sure that his superiors are fooled into thinking that the orders have been carried out he stages a fake jettison, and hijacks the ship and the last remaining forest dome. As time goes by Lowell not only cares for the plants and animals he loves so much, he becomes more acquainted with the robots who are his only activating friends, teaching them to also to maintain the forest, as well as play cards and other small human like activities to pass the time, but after two accidents, Louie is lost in space, and Huey he accidentally collides with in a buggy, so just he and Dewey remain. Lowell is horrified to find that the dome is not functioning properly, and due to this the plant life on the ship is dying out, despite watering, but he realises it is the lack of sunlight, so he uses high beams to solve this, but he knows the ship Berkshire will eventually find him, so he jettisons the dome from the Valley Forge, and he sets charges to destroy the ship, with him still on board, the enormous greenhouse drifts peacefully into space, with Dewey continuing to care for the forest. Also starring Cliff Potts as John Keenan, Ron Rifkin as Marty Barker, Jesse Vint as Andy Wolf, Mark Persons as Drone 1 (Dewey), Cheryl Sparks as Drone 2 (Huey) and Steven Brown as Drone 3 (Louie). Dern gives a great sensitive performance as the man willing to protect the life of plants and animals that he cares about, it definitely makes you question whether we take these elements on Earth for granted, they are part of life and are most certainly part of what makes the planet continue to exist, so the story keeps you engaged, especially with fantastic and imaginative special effects imagery, and occasional threat and explosions, an admirable and interesting science-fiction drama.

However, some movie-goer's, like myself, happened to enjoy this film, and as a shooting star of a moneymaker, Silent Running soars high in the universe. A giant, global-killing asteroid, like the one that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is 14 days away from hitting the Earth. NASA's been caught with their pants down and needs a new plan to keep some plants alive. They enlist the help of Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), an expert deep core driller, to train their astronauts and help them drill into the asteroid and plant a wheat crop. But Freeman figures the astronauts can't be trained in time and opts to go with his own imaginary drilling crew. To get the flaws over and done with, Silent Running is sometimes too far-fetched that it becomes a little bit laughable, and Bruce Derns' character, Freeman, is the hero. He isn't likable one bit, unlike Derns' former heroic gun-aimer's and space travelling characters. But those things are quite minor, and great performances from Ron Rifkin and Cheryl Sparks &#x96; especially Sparks, as the beautiful and Earthly young droid who sends her two most important men into sport &#x96; make up for Derns' half-effort. Also, a star-studded cast supports the three drones, including the never bad Dewey, giant Michael Clarke Duncan, the calm Huey and the weirdly watchable Luey. All these actors play their roles well, and each have more faith in the story than some of the other main stars alone. Douglas Trumbull controls his crew well, and he works excellently with the special effects team to create a stunning view of space, and some awesome blasting sounds that will unnerve you. Silent Running is not as bad as you may of heard, and even though it isn't Best Picture material, it is still an excellent form of entertainment, a film that is able to mix romance, thrills and full-on adventure nicely and without struggle.

Botanist Bruce Dern gets a little warped when he is told the mission is over and to destroy the space greenhouses before heading back home. He kills his two man crew in hopes of protecting his forest and hiding from humanity. He has a trio of maintenance robots that practically steal the show. The only real downside is enduring some out of date whining by Joan Baez. Of course Turnbull leads the F/X staff. When you really think about it...fantasy is not that far away from reality.

SR's opening scene has us looking at flowers and bunnies, while that moron Joan Baez belts out an unmistakably 60-ish tune, with lyrics that are probably about love and understanding and some such crap. (Don't get me wrong, though the movie has a great soundtrack. Morons often produce good music; it's just like with movies.) A little later, SR reveals its back-to-nature theme, which - apart from Marxism - was essentially what hippie dogma was always all about. (Of course, only in theory, never in practice; hippies were, are, and always will be hypocrites.)In spite of all this, SR is a fun and very well-made movie. The PC environmental message comes from a distant-enough future setting, so it comes off as common-sense-based, rather than hysterically over-dramatic - which is usually the case with green films. (Boorman's silly jungle movie, Emerald Forrest, for example, but also Medicine Man, The Day After Tomorrow, and many others.) Even though Dern kills his shipmates, he does not come off as a foam-at-the-mouth rabid environMentalist, but his actions are totally justified, hence the viewer sympathizes with him. (Especially Al Gore, who might have posters of Dern's Lowell plastered all over his villa walls.) The special effects and the sets in particular were ahead of their time; the influence of 2001 is quite obvious. (Trumbull worked on that movie, as well, so it's no surprise.) SR has a very good visual quality and the film-makers succeeded in creating a unique feel.The story may be slow for some MTV-generation jokers, but that's exactly how this movie had to be written/paced in order to be effective.

Scarier than ALIEN....","Date":"29 August 2003","Score":"3 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  SPOILERS I will warn you of spoilers ahead in compliance with IMDb rules, but the chances of spoiling anything in this goofball movie are extremely slim. Trust me when I say that there are no surprises in this movie.SILENT RUNNING fits into that humanity-has-broken-the-Earth sci-fi genre. Instead of the nuclear apocalypse or disease that has devastated the planet in movies like MAD MAX or PLANET OF THE APES or THE OMEGA MAN, the planet has been rendered devoid of plants and trees by rampant overconsumption of resources.  For some reason, the powers that be have sent several ships into space with biospheres containing deserts, forests, etc. to protect them. Our protagonist is a gardener of sorts on one of these space ships.  He has been placed with a crew of three other reckless louts who seem to delight in wrecking his beloved plants and can't understand his love of fresh fruit, especially cantaloupe.  (I swear!  I'm not making any of this up!)  The hero is pushed over the edge when the government on Earth orders the biospheres to be destroyed.  The solution?  Kill the humans and run away with the trees.  That results in over 60 minutes of nothing but Bruce Dern sharing screen time with the least cute androids ever created and the sounds of Joan Baez singing.  There is absolutely nothing interesting or edifying about this movie.  It is illogical, silly, strained, awkward and, most of all, dull.  Absolutely nothing happens once the shipmates are dead.  It makes no sense even as a warning tale.  It's hippie-dippy nonsense that seems to be saying that humans need to be careful of our resources and then plasters shipping containers in the ship with the logos of multi-national corporations like Coke and Dow Chemical as though these corporations are somehow contributing to saving the trees in space.  (There are even acknowledgments at the end of the movie thanking the companies that loaned their corporate brands to the filmmakers.)  And why would anyone send the trees into space?  Would someone really say, Hey, we're almost out of trees.  Let's send the last of them into space so we'll be completely out of them!  The murdered shipmates even point out that the treeless Earth has reached a point where there is no poverty, sickness or hunger, and yet our hero seems to want a return to earlier times because people could eat fresh fruit.  This is the same kind of logic that allowed people in the late 60's and early 70's to eat health food while taking heroin.  Top it off with some of Joan Baez's least interesting, preachiest songs and you have a movie that is so bad it doesn't even have camp value.Just horrible....

The first twenty minutes you almost believe you are watching a movie (even though the one dimensional characters and cheesy script rapidly fill you with a sense of foreboding).But once the Bruce Dern character makes his choice, he has literally nowhere to go (and so does the movie). So we are stuck watching a man spiraling into depression and failure, spending his time in mostly futile endeavors i.e, lecturing or playing with pieces of equipment (robots... That theme might have been interesting (a certainly original, if a little bit somber) the story of a man that is willing to sever ties with the rest of humanity (including the murder of other human beings) for what he considers a good cause..... And finds out that, alone as no human being has ever been, you just can't live at all.Had it been the filmmakers real intent, and if someone of the caliber of Ingmar Bergman had been directing, this movie might have been ambitious and meaningful.But it is clearly not what this movie is about and the only emotion conveyed by this film is a sense of pointlessness and massive boredom. The Bruce Dern character just fails to reach whatever were his goals and when reality catches him, he just commits suicide leaving a machine doing his works in his stead  obviously an illusory solution, as we well imagine that, at some point in the future, the ark he lets adrift in space will experience mechanical failure, and his sacrifice will have been in vain. The sad story of a complete looser in space... Defitinely not a film that people suffering of depression should watch.As why some people seem to have loved this movie, it remains a mystery to me. My guess is that, at the time of its release the environment theme was a novelty. And the fact that a man could choose the side of nature against the side of humankind, was probably perceived as daring and groundbreaking. For the sake of the message the people were probably willing to suspend any sense of disbelief, and willed themselves to see a happy ending.But what remains today, are the fatal flaws in the plot, the implausible behavior of its hero and the inescapable fact that nothing of substance happens during at least two-third of the movie..On a personal note  Some friends and I organized a night of the worst movie each of us had to come with one movie (we restricted the field to the Horror/Fantastic/sci-fi genre. Well Silent Running (my candidate) won, hands down, in spite of a very stiff competition ) ! (I was personally very much impressed by Starcrash ), but the complete sense of pointlessness of silent running ultimately won the day !

Although it brings us a nice message about our natural environment and its preservation, many points in this movie annoyed me deeply. In my opinion, the biggest problem of the movie is the lack of scientific coherence. For example, in the movie, the crew lives inside that ship just as if they were in Earth's gravity, but there is no explanation or device that could create such gravity. Explosions in the space make loud sounds, although sound waves do not propagate in vacuum. OK, you can argue this is a fiction movie and in a fiction unimaginable things happen; but these things are more than unimaginable, they are scientifically incoherent. Also the reason why the ships with those forests were in the orbit of Saturn is not explained and seems a complete nonsense to me.Other reason for the low score is that some scenes are boring, stupid and add nothing to the movie. Seems they were filmed only to occupy time. The robots seems to be homemade, just like some scenes. In my view, the positive points of the film are only two the special effects are good for a movie made in 1972, and the message the it brings is nice. I watched this movie because Arthur C. Clarke mentioned it the epilogue of the book 2001 Space Odissey, but I'm really disappointed. I expected more from a movie cited by one of the more incredible science fiction books ever written.

I only gave this movie a chance because so many reviewers claimed this it was a brilliant classic that stands the test of time. Instead I found it to be a trite, poorly executed film that took important topics and packaged them into one of the most drawn out movies ever made.The acting was the worst I've seen in a long time (and keep in mind this is after I saw Justin Timberlake in another film, so that's a real insult for Silent Running). Despite me agreeing with the points of the lead character he still came off as a complete nutjob in the delivery. While the director attempted to make him sympathetic I found the opposite to be true; I grew to dislike him more and more as the movie went on.I know this might be a trivial observation but Bruce Dern's hair was so frizzy and poorly cut that it drove me to distraction (all the human characters were like this but the lead was the worst). I know this was the early 70's but come on. I hope the stylist was laughed out of LA when this hit the box office. Even though I don't require that a lead character be overly attractive, I do ask that he at least be tolerable to look at, especially if he's the only human left after 20 minutes of the film's beginning. I think I winced for a solid hour having to look at Bruce Dern's frumpy features and undefined&#133; everything. Could anyone relate to this guy even back then? Everything else about this movie was probably as bad as the choice of lead character. The special effects were really under funded (every spaceship shot was glaringly a cardboard/foam model, the point of embarrassment). The robot characters were supposed to come off as either cute or at least multi-dimensional; I found them to be neither (maybe this was back when giving robots a personality in movies was the cool thing to do and thus the audience ate it up). Finally, the music score is gut-wrenching.I honestly cannot think of one thing I liked about this movie.
