James Gray has directed with a sure hand, exerting amazing control over a wide variety of performers and flawlessly maintaining a haunting and menacing mood in his tale of crime and punishment among Russian immigrants in Brooklyn. Vanessa Redgrave is superb, as usual, and Maxmillian Schell has been kept from the unrestrained emotionalism to which he is prone (see JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG), so that he gives one of his very best performances in years. As for Edward Furlong and Tim Roth, both of whom can be very good or very bad, lets just say they haven't been this good before or since. Gray's command over such aspects of the film as pacing and visual style is impressive. The whole thing builds to a stunning climax.

He returns to do some hit-man work here returning to his life existentially and bringing nothing but death and destruction. His little brother adores and idolizes him, even after seeing him kill a man and burn him up in an incinerator. He secrets a gun in his drawer, a sign of his wish to become like Roth which gets him quite a beating from the abusive father played brilliantly by Schell. There are no heroes here; the movie is black as pitch. The mother, played by Redgrave, is dying of an inoperable brain tumor. The movie follows Roth's return, reconnecting with little brother and girlfriend. The beatings visited upon Furlong, his little brother, prompt violent retaliation by Roth upon his father building to his near execution out in a winter's field. The movie intimates that the father's brutality produced the monster Roth and his apprentice in training Furlong. It is not a mystery how brutalized youths seek existential compensation for their feelings of deep helplessness and victimization, in youth, by developing into true monsters. They feed upon the power of destroying others for money that fills that chasm inside of themselves.I refer readers to the excellent movie Mad Dog Coll that also depicts his humiliation in childhood with his developing into a sadistic, laughing ghoul in adulthood. I love this movie but it is one painful viewing. The acting is excellent and it is relentless and unyielding. Poor Furlong is drawn into Roth's world with the realistic consequences ensuing. The movie's power is really in its delving into the etiology of existential monsters who destroy others for the feeling of power that they feed upon. Roth is ice here, even towards his little brother there are acts of kindness but no verbal or physical affection. His sex with his girlfriend is also violent and devoid of affection. The scene that contains the essence of the movie is when an old associate spots Roth on the Boardwalk. Roth calmly follows him and as the man is about to drop a dime on him, walks up and shoots him in the head. The action is as automatic and dispassionate as if we were opening our car door. The man has killed so many people that there is no affective content to any of his violence; it is completely robotic. Even Roth's protection of Furlong is never followed by affection towards him, when he confronts Schell it is always vicarious revenge. He is angry about his mistreatment of Furlong because he suffered the same; he often says this as he is pushing or hitting Schell. When Furlong is killed, Roth simply bags him up and takes him to the incinerator. There is no apparent sorrow, he is a machine. If someone asked me why I love this movie it is because it shows you that children who are treated cruelly grow up to be monsters. The film is a great existential biography of a living iceberg who can never kill enough people to remove that deep feeling of powerlessness he suffered as a bruised and battered child. Parents, this movie is not for children. It is dark as midnight and features one of the coldest monsters ever depicted on film. That said, if you would like to understand the psychological pathology of the sociopath there is not a better movie to watch. The acting is excellent, especially Roth, Schell and Redgrave. Dark As Night But An Excellent Movie.

The other British stalwart in this, the equally excellent Vanessa Redgrave was another point of interest for me. There's a real brutal efficiency to this film that makes it unlikeable but also demands respect and our attention. Roth is the roving assassin who is forced to do his next job in his old neighbourhood and that means getting reacquainted with his family dying Mum (Redgrave), hateful and abusive Father (Maximilian Spiel), as well as impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong). 24 year old d√©butant director James Gray comes up with - and scripts - a surprisingly mature piece of crime cinema that is both poignant, moving and shocking.To my mind, the violence should rate the film at 18, not 15; the cold- blooded unfeeling of Roth's callous and unflinching jobs don't even give us time for any bad taste to form in our mouths. I can see that some would find this a barrier to their enjoyment in what is mostly a character- driven drama of some depth. The winter-set scenes of back street Brooklyn are chillingly authentic and bleak and these help remind us of the family's Russian roots. The father, a devout Jew, who's also having an affair often speaks Russian still, hanging to his identity the best he can, in an alienating, changing and disintegrating world. There are also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too.

"},{"Title":"Another intense performance by Roth","Date":"5 March 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" This is a review of Little Odessa, The Yards and We Own the Night, three crime dramas by director James Gray.Released in 1994, Little Odessa stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira, a volatile criminal who has been exiled by his family. A prodigal son returns narrative, the film watches as Roth returns to his family home. Though his relatives still distrust him, Joshua is idolised by his younger brother, little Reuben Shapira (Edward Furlong). The film ends, as most prodigal son tales do, with Reuben dying, paying for his brother's sins.Little Odessa was Gray's debut. It's a very good drama, well acted by the always electric Tim Roth, but the film's ethnic details are unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious, overblown sequence in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down.Gray followed Odessa up with The Yards (2000), a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to Odessa, and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an ex-convict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean, to keep his nose out of crime, but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the brotherhood dynamics of Odessa, Wahlberg playing the good son who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously over-the-top death sequence.While The Yards has a certain, smothering pretentiousness about it, convinced about its own importance (it's lit like Rembrandt, street fights are filmed like Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's The Godfather), Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes, like a beautifully sensitive welcome-home party, a wordless assassination attempt and a fine, aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag.Gray then directed We Own The Night, arguably his best crime flick. The good brother/bad brother motif returns, this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drug-runners and mafia types, and Wahlberg's a straight-arrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops, Phoenix switches allegiances, goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of Donnie Brasco, Rush, Point Break, Serpico, State of Grace, Infernal Affairs and every other undercover cop movie you can think of, but the film is beautifully lit, is atypically straight-faced and features a superb, rain-soaked car chase.Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a classical, almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours, their fates forgone. Mostly, though, Gray's trilogy highlights the ways in which contemporary artists have struggled to conceive of a response to postmodernism. The crime movies of, say, Tarantino and Scorsese, are unashamedly postmodern, toying with and regurgitating clich√©s from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about crime, so much as they're pastiche jobs, jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic, artists who deem themselves serious, who rightfully ask what exactly comes next?, tend to look backwards at what came before, as though post-war modernism, by virtue of being modernism, is intrinsically the solution. This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy, which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1940s, minus the irony and flippancy.But you can't go backwards in this way; your audience will always be ten steps ahead and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre, for example fare like The Wire, which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both global capitalism and crime, are neither modernist or postmodern, whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement neoprimitivism, pseudomodernism, participatism, post-post modernism, but the one that seems to be sticking is new modernism.Whatever you call it, this hypothetical movement rejects postmodern nihilism (nothing matters, there is no truth, it's just a film), actively tries to convey the complexities of our world, and covertly believes that it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements, take stands, approach objectivity, and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to understand, teach, decipher and make better the world, and in its emphasis on culture, society, technology and politics. The movement doesn't reject postmodernism, but co-opts its tropes and bends them to suit its aim, questioning agency, subjectivity and attempting to piece together the fragments and multiple perspectives that typify complex systems. In short, truly relevant crime films simultaneously simulate our contemporary environment of junk, noise, commerce and static, before proceeding to decode, organise and target roots. As William Gibson said way back in the 1980s, future great artist will function like search engines, mapping and making sense of the detritus. Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.

Good direction and photography. The use of the Russian choral music throughout set the mood on medium-creepy, even when that was the only clue. I've never been to Brighton Beach, or even Brooklyn, but the film really brought home the gritty reality of that immigrant community.

It's a take on the prodigal son, here as a cold contract killer. A great watch for connoisseurs of films, and mobster film in particular.The movie stands out for great acting, directing and photography, being James Gray directorial debut. Music is excellent as well. The actors are making this a great watch. The whole film is stuffed with fabulous acting. Tim Roth and Edward Furlong is both fabulous as the brothers, as Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell is as the mother and the abusive father. I think this is some of the best I've seen from them all.The film starts up with the contract killer, being the older brother Joshua Shapira coming back to his hometown of Brooklyn after being away for years, to do a contract job. He fled town after committing a killing, which obviously is not forgotten. He meets his younger brother, Reuben, which tells him that their mother is terminally ill with brain tumor. Joshua wants to see the mother, but are not welcomed by the father, being a danger to the whole family since wanted by the mobsters.It's bleak, cold, gritty, effective and what I believe very realistic told. I was immediately sucked into the story, which is following the younger brother more than the older hit-man. it's no action movie, but a mobster movie told in the way we've seen many times. This does not stand back from these. The film builds slowly up to great scenes.It's powerful on emotions, far more than on the action. However the persons are quite cold, and so is the violence. And there isn't much hope to see in the dreary days of this family.The quote We'll wait 10 seconds and see if God saves you is said by Tim Roth's character before he does a killing. I would regard this is a must-see for mob film lovers, and a classic in the genre. I would likewise recommend the brilliant and effective Eastern promises by David Cronenberg, telling a story from the Russian mafia in Great Britain.

This is not his first contract as he is a hired gun, hence his banishment from his family... more specifically his father - Max Schell.Throughout the film his struggle to connect on any level with where he comes from is the underlying theme and ultimately the ruination of his family and love(?) - in parts natural (his Mother), associative (his Lover), accidental (his Brother) and finally purposeful (his Father). For it is his Father's body that he disposes of at the films conclusion (note the slippers and the weight of the body).

This movie was his vision and I strongly disagree with his warped view of immigrants. Years ago when I was in a wealthy suburban town far from Brighton Beach, I was asked whether I saw the film. I was also asked whether I was ever involved in the Russian mafia. I answered no to both questions. It was true I had never seen the film, nor had I ever been involved with Russian organized crime. I was a first-generation American, who because of my parents and grandparents was able to speak Russian, and my family's hopes of achieving the American Dream rested firmly on my shoulders. The man who had asked me these questions was an accomplished educator, who had even once been invited to the Oval Office. He was always borderline derisive of me and I felt that he had seen me as a stereotypical Russian mobster in the making. It was years later when I finally watched the film and I was fuming. I want to convey several issues to Americans about this film. The most important issue is that crime exists everywhere, but Brighton Beach is not controlled by the Russian Mafia. There is barely any presence of Russian organized crime, and most residents have vaguely heard or interacted with these elements. The protagonist of the film, a Russian Jewish hit-man who fled Brighton Beach to evade the ire of the Russian Mafia, was a plot-driven character who did not even slightly resemble any of the young immigrants who arrived to Brighton Beach during the 1970's and 1980's. Joshua Shapira was as realistic as Peter Pan. Second, the elderly generation was poorly portrayed in this film. It was filmed in 1993 and Jacob's 80-year-old grandmother was James Gray's idea of an off-the-boat immigrant. I almost laughed at how the grandmother only spoke Yiddish and was an old world zombie. That is absolute nonsense. It is true that that generation could speak Yiddish, but they in fact spoke Russian much more frequently and were quite cognizant of history, politics, and current events. That generation, my grandparents, attended English courses for immigrants and were able to converse in basic English. I will admit that not all could do this. Some still had to work, while others had to babysit their grandchildren. My point is that the grandmother in this film, an Old World Yiddish-only zombie, was not in any way, shape, or form similar to the grandparents of the Soviet Jewish immigration. My grandfather, who recently passed away, spoke Yiddish, Russian, and rudimentary English (because he worked in this country for many years). He also was always mindful of American and world politics. The portrayal of grandparents in this movie was ridiculous and unrealistic. For example, on my way to the Brighton Beach library I remember overhearing two World War 2 generation Soviet immigrants discussing Hillary Clinton's first international tour as Secretary of State in 2009. The baby boomers, who are grandparents today on Brighton Beach, can speak English proficiently and are quite Americanized. Third, the mother suffering from cancer at home and implicitly unable to get medical care because she is an immigrant is absurd. The United States fully provided medical care and support to the underprivileged. If the Shapiro family were in fact as poor as the family portrays, she would had been able to receive Medicaid/Medicare benefits and the government would have paid for her treatments. It was a sinister exaggeration that the poor immigrant suffering from cancer had to die at home and implicitly the reason was because of her impoverished immigrant status. Absolutely bogus. She would have been provided full medical benefits and not suffer at home like portrayed in the film. Fourth, the father in the film was the stereotypical Soviet dictator parent who was domineering, abusive, and emotionless. The character was just a plot-driven element of the film not remotely similar to any of the Soviet Jewish immigrants who had supported their children, who were either born in the USA or arrived as young children. He was clearly the antagonist of the film, and when the accomplished educator I had mentioned earlier spoke to me about Brighton Beach, I distinctly remember him asking what my father was like. I can assure you that 99% of the Soviet Jewish parents were not Stalin-like brutes. They, in fact, were completely supportive because they wanted their kids to be successful Americans. The father in this film, who dressed like they did at the turn of the century and not the 1990's and stood on Brighton Beach at night with others drinking Vodka with prostitutes, was nowhere close to any reasonable behavior or individual I have encountered on Brighton Beach. The father was an absurd character created by a warped view of what a Soviet immigrant patriarch would be like. I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it, but as the entire movie suggests Brighton Beach is a dark world full of crime, sadness, and tragedy. False. False. False. New Yorkers from all five boroughs travel to the beach and boardwalk during the warmer months, and Brighton Beach is full of restaurants, Sushi bars, and Russian nightclubs. I cannot explain to you how ridiculous it was when Joshua in the end sat in his car alone thinking about all the tragic events during the film. Even when this was filmed in 1993, the movie was a terrible and inaccurate portrayal of Brighton Beach and the Soviet Jewish immigrants who inhabit it. I can tell you that the Soviet Jewish immigrants who arrived when they were young and first-generation Americans who were born here did not live in Little Odessa and were not inclined to a life of crime. Education, hard work, and successful careers are the attributes of those who inhabit Brighton Beach and this movie was complete fiction in its portrayal of the older immigrants, younger immigrants, and first-generation Americans.

A lot of this is lent by Roth's performance - he's a cold blooded killer and he plays it with more the poker face than Hopkins in Remains of the Day.Denouement? Watch for it. When the movie's over you might miss the fact it's over. Is this a highly recommendable flick? Hard to say. Some excellent work here. But will you enjoy it? Benefit by it?That's a much more difficult question.PS. Hey IMDb! Stop correcting our spelling and giving us no chance to correct your incorrect corrections.

At the same time I found myself pinned to the screen, watching an extraordinary roll-call of performance from three generations of first-class screen actors. It is a great shame that the plot is so makeshift, so flaky.Roth plays a prodigal hit-man, Joshua, who returns to the town of the title for a contract against his instinct. None of the characters, largely all suffering old, unresolved antagonisms, can help themselves but be drawn to one another on his return, combustibly, tearfully but inevitably. Edward Furlong, a truly exceptional actor in every film in which I've seen him is heartbreaking here. Roth is an empty, jittery presence and the stymied reconciliation with his mother is desperate; Vanessa Redgrave is too much actually, but perhaps it's appropriate given that she is dying. It's too miserable in the end. 5/10 "},{"Title":"One of the best movies I've seen...","Date":"13 October 1998","Score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  James Gray simply blew my brains out few years ago with this flick!

I don't mind dark movies, but for me there has to be shades of darkness throughout. This film - which is still unquestionably an astonishingly accomplished debut from Gray - simply never lets up, so that its pessimistic world view becomes exhausting. It's a world without hope or redemption, a fatalistic dirge that seems to wallow in its own misery. Roth isn't one of my favourite actors, but he's pretty good here - perhaps because he is called upon to conceal his emotions behind a blank expression. He's not a likable man - in fact he's seriously damaged and uses his gun as a defence against the world as much as he does a weapon. The entire cast give credible performances, but it's Maximilian Schell as Roth's deeply flawed father who stands out.

The story is great, the movie is not. Tim Roth is fantastic as the disowned, disgraced, murderous son. Roth always gives a very strong performance and does so again here. Edward Furlong, one of my favorites, unfortunately does not do as well. I've seen him in enough things to know, it's not his fault, it's the writing. This film is so dark and painfully slow that I barely made it through. Very little is explained and the dialog is laughable, even at times non-existent. There are huge plot holes to go along with an ending that makes little sense. The writer was trying to tell his story more through imagery and symbolism in a genre that is based on action. You can't pull off something like this without explaining more of the story and using it to move things along. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but to be honest, I was bored from start to finish.

Tim Roth plays the oldest son of the family who has been banished from Brooklyn after a murder he committed. Now he returns after a long absence to commit another assigned assassination. Maximilian Schell is the father who has disowned him, Vanessa Redgrave the mother dying of brain cancer and Edward Furlong the teenage brother who is growing apart from his father and longing for a strong male role model. Roth isn't a good one, of course, but Furlong becomes intrigued by criminal life. It's a deeply felt film with well written situations and characters. I can't imagine why it has such a low rating on IMDb. It seems that people are unhappy that the film makes them unhappy, which is an attitude that always pisses me off. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction came out the same year, and made the life seem like a lot more fun, even if you sometimes get shot at, and, consequently, sometimes die (but only sometimes). Pulp Fiction is perhaps the more original film, but Little Odessa is a deeper film.

Is it just me or is Edward Furlong the victim of his brother's doing again (American History X). And he wasn't bothering no one, he was just there to help.  To average to be good, but still strong enough to touch the viewer. Which reminds me; I don't have the slightest idea what that final scene meant.It shows the scene where Tim Roth meets his ill mother for the first time in many years. It's weird because this first-time-meeting scene is shown sometime earlier in the movie and I just don't understand why Tim Roth would be thinking about the part where he just comes into the room and he and Mrs. Redgrave just look uncomfortably at each other. After his flashback is over there's this long shot of Tim Roth in the car and then fade back and the movie ends. ??????????????????????????????????????????????

He is still wanted there by gangs seeking revenge for an old hit.  However when he is offered a straight forward hit in Little Odessa he takes it on.  He uses it as an opportunity to catch up with his little brother, Ruben, his dying mother and his father who hates him for all the problems Joshua has brought on the family.  Word gets out that Joshua is back in the area and problems begin to come back into Brooklyn.The directorial debut of 25 year old James Gray is a cold look at a hitman in a non sensational light.  The setting is a freezing, snow covered Brooklyn that is as cold emotionally as it is temperature wise.  The story is quite slow and may frustrate some people in the way it deals with hitmen but has very little gun action.  However the actual story looks at the heart of killer Joshua, part of him is cruel and sadistic and filled with anger, however a part of him is still human although it is very well hidden.  The emotion of the story is slow and takes work to get to it, however the relationship between the father, Joshua and Ruben is captivating.Roth is excellent as Joshua, it's difficult to bring such a character to life but he does it well despite his cold exterior.  Furlong is also excellent as Ruben - he looks haggard and put upon and very convincing, this can't be the same kid who was in T2!  Schell and Redgrave are both as good as you'd expect them to be, although Schell is by far the most interesting character.Overall the emotion of the story makes it.  However the lack of traditional hitman action and the slow pace of the dialogue driven scenes may put many off looking into the story.

And the guy was only 24! What will strike you about this film is the economy of footage and the directorial vision. Gray knows exactly what shots are needed and how long to use them, there is none of this showy, slappy editing or gratuitous shots. Each scene is composed and skillful. You really get the sense that he had every shot meticulously choreographed and planned out before showing up on the set, and further, that this planning was dead-on in its strengthening of the mood and tone of the picture. To illustrate this, there is one scene where Tim Roth shoots someone in broad daylight. Gray handles this scene so that it is jarring without accessorizing or glamorizing the violence. It is quick and sudden. Any number of directors would have shot the hell out of this scene and used a million angles and would have had no idea of how to play the scene in context. And this is a minor scene, a simple scene. The entire film is completely well-thought out and uses this same masterful direction. Gray also knows how to use a camera and where to put them. This film is visually stimulating without going overboard, like the difference between Jimmy Page and Steve Vai virtuosity and skill does not have to equal genius, god knows what Guy Ritchie would have done to this film, but it sure would've been unwatchable. A director, like any artist, must know how much to include and when to stop, and Gray gets this right.If you have ever liked Ed Furlong or Tim Roth, you will love them in this. They are both allowed room to really deliver emotional, realistic, and moving performances. How do they do this when they've been good and bad in other films? That's right they were directed properly. Both actors were right for their parts but they were also kept to a very real tone, something that separates a director like Gray from one like Joanou or whoever directed that thing Boondock Saints (both films could possibly be described as in the same genre as this one). In summary, this is an amazing debut film with solid performances and gripping story.

Joshua has had the same type of stable middle-class upbringing as his younger brother, yet he becomes a remorseless killer.  Why?  Reuben, the younger brother, seems to have sound values; he knows his brother for what he is, yet demonstrates a degree of loyalty far beyond what one would expect.  Why?  Alla appears reasonably intelligent and not altogether emotionally starved, but is drawn to Joshua.  Why?     The final irony in which Reuben and Alla die on Joshua's account will be familiar to even occasional filmgoers.    If the character of the father is to be cited as a source of the sons' alienation, it is altogether human to be frustrated (and therefore quick-tempered) when your best efforts have so little to show for them.  The man has been worn down by life, yet he cares for his elderly mother and terminally ill wife with as much tender love as he can muster.  An adulterer?  With his wife dying slowly of a brain tumor, perhaps he deserves a kinder appellation.   The family is Jewish, although that appears to be of no real significance in regard to the characters, plot or atmosphere.  Likewise the story being set in Brooklyn. Striking visuals can do only so much for a film.  More attention to the narrative would have been helpful.
