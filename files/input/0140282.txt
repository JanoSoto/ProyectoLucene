You will be tearing your hair out=)    ***************************************************         For those of you who surf, who know what it *feels* like to ride a wave, you will appreciate this movie ( I guarantee) more than any other surf movie or documentary you've ever seen. Believe me, take it from a surfer. THESE 'ACTORS' ARE NOT ACTORS. THEY ARE WORLD-CLASS/COMPETITION SURFERS.   And though those retentive people will point out that they can't act, I am saying what they do in this film is the *only* way to act. Zalman King used his head here to have three world-class surfers, ( Matt George, Shane Patrick Dorian, and Matty Liu), one of which was #1 in the world for three straight years(Dorian). I have a friend who met him and told me how cool he was and that he's actually *very* self-conscious about the gap between his teeth. I think it is beautiful to watch him try to speak without showing it in the film, because this is a reflection of his true self; his true insecurity. He is also shy about being in the spotlight, even limiting televised interviews on surfing networks.     Anyway, the screen gladly welcomes him here, along with many other surfers, including many 'seniors' over 35, (one of which who invented the toe-in surfboard),  who make a few cameos throughout the movie.***  IF YOU'RE A CINEMATOGRAPHY LOVER (as I am) you will LOVE this movie. The waves, the colors, the sensuality. Yes, this movie is *very* sensual. This film was directed by the same guy who made 9 1/2 weeks, and Two Moon Junction. Because the main focus is on the surfing, the tiny love story in it keeps you wanting more. Somehow everything looks sensual (ie flowing hair, pearls falling on a seashell in slow-mo, the smiling girl on the train, the music). Everything in this movie can be freeze-framed and it would never look boring. There is always something deep within each picture the characters seem to be thinking and transferring to the screen. SIMPLY PUT, this movie is a work of art. ***  IF YOU LIKE MOVIES TO ENLIGHTEN YOU, this movie will serve its purpose. It delves into the minds of these young men. It steers clear of trying to be something it's not. You end up wanting to be out there with them, riding those waves. You end up understanding, by the end of the film, why (at least Dorian) was always looking for that 'one big wave that starts all the other waves', to simply get that feeling. You'll end up wondering what would make you feel that way in your own life. It might be surfing.And YES, this movie could've been changed to a documentary on surfers, but why? They would not have had as wide of an audience, and there are simply NOT enough movies about surfing out there. People need to know more about the greatest sport on Earth.This movie is for everyone except for lazy, narrow-minded people, who can go back to criticizing movies that should have been documentaries.

Next review was totally different from the first one. Someone wrote about it as an excellent film, but he/she understood why people had given it such bad review, though it should be watched by people who can relate to the story / scenario / lifestyle which the film is built on.I got even more interested and eazed back in the bed, made my self comfortable and thus ready for watching the film. I saw it, really tensed to the television, even to excited to go get myself a glass of Coca-Cola during the commercials. Furthermore, now when I've seen and analyzed the film from A to Z, I can tell you, the film is really great. I couldn't find any Really wack actors, and the story worked fine with me. A few hidden wisdom-quotes made the film even more touching.Go see this one!

I'm a film buff, I can and generally do find enjoyment in most films, and this is a good example. If I were voting for the screenplay, direction, acting, it would get a 3. Technically a 6, yet for the cinematography a 10. I'm not fence sitting here, as a film is generally a team effort, utilising the skills of many, and to succeed the director/producers have to pull it all together, and pull up those lagging behind, not let them pull you under. Sadly the latter appears to be the case with In God's Hands, hence the fact I find it hard to give a single vote, due to this disparity of skill, But all will become clear, as you read on, Well although it's a few years old now, In God's Hands deserves some comment I feel. I've had it on DVD a few years, and only just got around to watching it a second time, (thanks to the random button on my DVD archive), as I probably would not have bothered otherwise.But having got through it, it does have some redeeming qualities, and a few mind blowing ones, hence this additional comment for IMDb.It is one of those films that could have been so much better, if only they had stuck to a core story line. Great surfing, huge waves, awesome locations, and some of the best cinematography you will EVER see, (but more on that shortly).Where it all goes horribly wrong, is the fact these amazing surfers, some of the best in the world, are simply NOT actors. They are not aided by the fact much of the dialogue scripted them, is hammy beyond belief, the result of which nearly sinks this film.Had the makers actually committed to making a surf movie, scrapped all the sub plot, and story lines used, it would have made a far better movie.Actually the scenes with Brion James, show up the leads lack of acting ability, which isn't really fair on them, they are world class surfers after all, not actors. But it is a good example of just how a skilled actor, much like good special effects are transparent, You accept the performance without a second thought. The reverse is not true, and poor performances/acting ability, delivery, timing etc, tend to stand out during much of the surfers dialogue scenes. Maylin Pultar is worth a mention here, Parisian multi talented, multi artiste, really smolders in some scenes, and knows how to pull it off too, much of the time without a word uttered, (take note lads, this is how you should have handled your dialogue as well).So back to the movie, and this is the sad bit really, this has to be one of the prettiest films of the last 20 years. John Aronson is without question a master behind the camera, knowing when to lock off, and not move the camera, to maximise the impact of some JUST PERFECT composition. When it's all out there, right in front of the lens, having the maturity to lock off, and just roll. GREAT, so seldom done these days, it is like a breath of fresh sea air. Such a shame, the writers were not as skilled.The shots filmed from right there in the surf are great too, god knows how they did that safely?The soundtrack is worth a mention here, as it is pretty good too actually, the big waves need some big subs though, but those frequencies go way, WAY down, so caution to those with unbalanced sound systems, and a preference to high volumes.So what does all this leave us with? Well a mixed bag I'm afraid.If you're a script writer, this is how NOT to do it. If you are a stills photographer, and/or have an appreciation for the golden rules, section, ratio, mean, light, shade and shadows, you will love this film, drop the audio out, cue up a CafÃ© del Mar CD, sit back and enjoy. If you're a budding cameraman, this is how it's done, make no mistake, old school rules or not, I can't think of more extreme shots, from locked off to in the surf! And if you are into surfing, you can't go wrong with this one, the surf scenes are simply great.So it is what it is, (pity they didn't just let it be).

Well, not much more at all.In God's Hands stars three non actors (that's pretty obvious) who are also top surfers. They're the real thing. Patrick Shane Dorian, Matt George and Matty Liu really do ride this 40 plus foot monsters in this film, and really are towed onto them by jet skis. And all of that is pretty awesome.I didn't find the sound track all that appealing but I think I've been wiped out in a bit of a Morning Of The Earth time warp for twenty years now. That surfing flick, which I saw in a hall  in the Coff's Harbour decades ago, just has to be one of the best films for me ever.But none of those Morning Of The Earth waves were the monsters that these lads snake down, and get murdered under.So the surfies out there, and there's plenty of them, will just have to see this fantastic wave action and they'll just have to see it on the big screen. They won't expect much more than just waves with human's sliding down them and they won't be disappointed.

The 3 boys names are Shane, Micky, and Keoni. They spend alot of time in a place (i can't remember which one) where Keoni gets malaria and burn a giant banner. This is where Shane spends time with his love, and they go to a festival. This is all after they meet Â¿Wyatt? who is kind of following Shane who is the best in the world. As I said they end up in Hawaii where they take jet skiis into the massive 60ft waves they crash there, but Micky doesn't believe in it, he belives that modern technology shouldn't be used and it should just be you and surfboard. He paddles into a 65ft wave and gets caught on the seam flips his board and dies. This is where i was confused, i didn't quite understand why he ran away with the rock. though I've hard many theories from my family and friends. Its really sad and i think the movie was very well done. One of the most memorable scenes is where Shane is talking about waves coming from a giant.

The story is slow and deliberate. The visuals are stunning. The acting is solid, but the dialog and the final editing is just average. The surfing is stellar, but considering the lengths the story goes to show how difficult it is, more explanation on techniques might have been useful. The other major complaint regards the main character. He's supposed to be quiet and 'deep'. But he comes across a little as simply anti-social, maybe even superior. It's not enough to make you dislike him, but it is enough to prevent sympathy. I'd highly recommend this movie to those who appreciate mood movies.

Then just FF to to the wave riding scenes and let your eyes feast on the 35mm footage of GIANT surf riding. It is absolutely mind-blowing. This film contains some of the greatest big wave surfing ever caught on film. Don't miss the tow-in body-board riding of Mike 'the Wizard Stewart. WOW! His '360' maneuver garnered the biggest cheers of the night at the opening showing of this film.The acting in this movie is so bad that it is actually pretty funny. Shane Dorian is an amazing surfer, but maybe, just maybe, should stick to his day job. Not sure if Shane will be putting an Oscar on his mantle anytime soon.

Does he hate the sport? Did he realize that the highly polished, kinetically charged surfing sequences would have made a great documentary, and so he decided to show his contempt for them by slapping on empty-headed melodrama?In the beginning there's some ludicrous high jinks in some African country (name of the country? I don't know -- New Orleans, I think, or maybe Hong Kong), followed by some scenes aboard a freighter (a freighter with no discernable purpose, manned by a crew of three), followed by a sequence at a surfer training camp (?), followed by scenes wherein one of the main characters gets struck down with a terrible sickness (yellow fever? small pox? heat cramps?), and then gets well. It ends with a bunch of surfing followed by a bunch of surfing.The dialogue is hollowed-out, cheesy ersatz Kerouac, mostly from a fellow who talks into a tape recorder for some vague future purpose (Dennis Hopper in The American Friend, anyone?)On the upshot, if there was money spent on anything for In God's Hands, it was the film stock and the cameras. Rarely has cinematography been this glisteningly, unabashedly beautiful, without a specific color scheme suited to the story (i.e. war movies, westerns).  It rivals anything John Toll achieved in his photography for The Thin Red Line.  In the end, however, this film is reduced to being a ninety-six minute screen saver, and belongs in the same trash bin as Hype Williams' Belly and Claude Lelouche's A Man and a Woman.
