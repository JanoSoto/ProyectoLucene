Big Top Pee Wee is as bad as Pee Wee's Big Adventure was good.   Other than some imaginative effects, Pee Wee looks like he fell out of the sky and landed in this movie.   I think Bill Murray would have been better cast in a movie with this plotline, especially in the scenes where Pee Wee is acting like a dog in heat.  Murray would make a convicing hayseed and slob on a farm.  Reubens seems to strain in his attempt to make something of the unfunny material he's given...the characters around him are generally unfunny as well.  How anyone came up with this farm, then circus plotline is beyond me.  The film is generally devoid of laughs.   An overall waste of the Pee Wee Herman character and one of the worst comedies I've ever seen.

Like the original, many bizarre touches are present and Reuben's portrayal is amusing.  Here he's a bit more seedy, including a very funny hair fetish.  The romance is unbelievable, though, because unlike the original, here Pee Wee is coupled with two supermodel class ladies.  Fine direction, decent acting, lots of freaks.  Kristofferson is funny as the perpetual man who knows where everybody should go (he plays that one a lot) in this case with a midget wife who's very very small.  Pleasing otherworldly atmosphere enhanced by the circus theme -- if only the producers had sprung for a TRAVELLING circus!  Still, this one didn't deserve the acid reviews and fan neglect it received on initial release, and should be given a fair look by fans of Reubens' neo-vaudeville comedy.

Pee-wee goes from living in California to living in a small farm in the middle of the suburbs.  His pet is a talking pig and the rest of the movie is just blah.  If they knew Pee-wee was for kids, I don't see why they had to put so much kissing in this movie.  Even the woman Pee-wee falls in love with is boring and has the world's most annoying accent.

Or it may be a very simple movie to appreciate, depending on who you are.Have a look at the following movies, and if you see at least 1 that you really like from EACH category, then you'll probably enjoy Big Top Pee-Wee.CATEGORY A ----------------------------Pee-wee's Big AdventureEdward ScissorhandsThe FallLabyrinthCATEGORY B ----------------------------Free WillyE.T.Anything by Walt DisneyThe Muppet MovieCategory A movies are fairy tales for adults. Category B movies are straightforward kid's movies. In order to appreciate Big Top Pee-wee you have to be ready for either. You have to expect some jokes & gags that only adults will recognize (mildly sexual, cynical or taboo such as the cranky old lady's hilarious reference to bulimia), but overall the film takes the format of a kid's movie, with lots of cute animals, predictable slapstick and a cheerful approach, right down to the cheezy sing-song finale.I think it's the latter--the category B kid content--that threw off a lot of fans. The original Pee-wee was an adult film packaged in a kid's presentation. But this is the opposite a kid's film in adult clothing.As such, the gags aren't as subtle & witty as adult comedies usually are. Like a Saturday morning kids show, Big Top Pee-wee comes on strong with exaggerated and hyper-enthusiastic dialogue, overt sight gags & corny action. This may turn off a lot of adults expecting the more biting, tongue-in-cheek comedy of the original Pee-wee.All the same, there are some classic comedic moments that adults & kids alike will enjoy. The whole I just wanted a cheese sandwich! scene had me rolling. I also liked the 1st picnic with Winnie which could easily have been a deleted scene in the original Pee-wee. The creepy townsfolk in general, contrasted against Pee-wee's oblivious optimism, provided great entertainment. But be forewarned, these acidic gags are sparsely presented. Most of the film is straightforward silliness, suitable for kids & young minds.Being a die-hard fan of the original film, and being a fan of adult fairy tales in general, I have a love-hate relationship with this movie and that's why I can't rate it. But I've seen it 4 times if that's any indication of how compelling it is. My gut says I shouldn't recommend it to everyone, but all the same, there will be a few of you out there who will really enjoy this flick. If you're a kid at heart, don't hesitate.

It brought to attention the previously unknown Tim Burton, who provided the perfect starring vehicle for oddball comedian Pee-wee Herman (in real life Paul Reubens).The mingling of Burton's kitsch aesthetic with Reuben's bizarre persona turned out to be a perfect match. Big Adventure had a very simple story to go from. Pee-wee wanted to be reunited with his beloved bike. And that basic premise was all it needed. Burton infused the film with a beautiful colour scheme, oddball delights and kooky curiosities, all played to the hilt by the irrepressible Pee-wee.Pee-wee's Big Adventure turned out to be a surprise box-office smash hit, cementing Burton's place among Hollywood's brightest and eccentric filmmakers.It took three years for a further instalment to arrive on the big screen. In the interim, Pee-wee got his own TV show, Pee-wee's Playhouse, and dominated the ratings as the host of one of America's most popular children's shows. Reubens took time out from the show in 1988 to make one more film, Big Top Pee-wee.Big Top came about a year before Reuben's career was damaged after he was caught masturbating in an X-rated movie theatre. The character was effectively retired after that, and although there is talk of a new Pee-wee Herman movie in the making, I'm still not entirely sure it will ever happen.In the meantime, we do have two of his adventures to fall back on. But after seeing Big Top, you wonder if you really want to see another one. Because the Pee-wee Herman you see here is not quite the one you remember.It seems that Pee-wee has done a bit of growing up. Where in the first he was content to potter about his pastel coloured mansion playing with Rube Goldberg breakfast making contraptions and copiously caring for his customized bike, here Pee-wee has settled into an almost normal life.Don't forget...I said almost! Pee-wee's now a farmer. He cultivates hot dog trees, tends to cows that produce chocolate milk, and he even has a talking pig, Vance as a business partner!He even has a personal life now. He's engaged to prim schoolmistress Winnie (Penelope Ann Miller), and lives in a normal town. Unfortunately, he's forced to share it with some not very nice townsfolk.But one windy day, fate blows a circus right into Pee-wee's backyard, all filled with curious kooks. First there's ringmaster Mace Montana (Kris Kristofferson, excellent). His wife, Midge, 2 inches tall, with a voice much bigger than she is. And best of all, Gina (Valeria Golino), the beautiful acrobat and star attraction, the woman Pee-wee falls for.I think the reason Big Top Pee-wee isn't as successful is because it doesn't have a director who's perfectly attuned to the material. The joy of the first film was Tim Burton provided an eccentric outsider's take on life. But this film's director, Randal Kleiser doesn't have that quality. He doesn't occupy Pee-wee's headspace the way Burton was able to.And the more Pee-wee tries to fit in to our world, the more apart from it he seems. He has no place in our world. He lives in one of his own rules and devisings.Also with foreknowledge of what was to come for Reubens, you do get a bit uncomfortable watching him 'nail' Winnie, engage in a bit of two-timing, and the film even implies that he loses his virginity to Gina. With him still hosting a children's show at the time of the film's release, that makes it seem all the more unpalatable.There are occasions where Big Top shows some of the similar quirks that made the first film so endearing. Like Pee-wee's farm animals sleeping in beds. Pee-wee plucking a worm from an apple to feed birds. And all the animals gathered around a table for breakfast. Danny Elfman also provides another whimsical film score to enjoy.But Big Top never really ignites. It never bursts out with the joy and exuberance that Burton brought to the first one. There is a good cast, but they somehow look a little awkward trying their best to connect with someone as alien as Pee-wee.Kris Kristofferson probably comes off best by playing the sincerity perfectly straight. But the one real shining light is the underrated Valeria Golino. She brings a passionate charge to the role of Gina. She brings Pee-wee down to earth, but is wise enough not to leave him there for too long. Because she knows he's always at his best when filled with childlike whimsy. She reminds us of the Pee-wee we once knew.Big Top Pee-wee never inhabits the bizarre, unreal world that made the first film such a treat. I think Pee-wee has become too domesticated. If there is to be another Pee-wee adventure, he can't be kept on a leash. He must be allowed to flourish. That way we can enjoy the company of the Pee-wee we remember so well.

We don't get the scenery and we do not get a very good or funny movie this time. Maybe it is because Phil Hartman did not help with the script or maybe because Tim Burton did not direct, but this movie is absolutely nothing like the first film and as I said before that is not a good thing. This time we have Pee Wee on a rather boring farm, where he has a talking pig and the towns folk are a bunch of bores. Then the circus gets blown into town and that shakes things up. That is about it, besides the odd love triangle involving Pee Wee...who for some reason goes from a loner and a rebel to kind of a perv. There are a couple of chuckles to be found near the beginning of the movie, but once the circus hits it is rather tedious to watch. Like I said you go from all the wacky stuff in big adventure to one setting and one setting only. You have a few stars in this one, but they don't add to the movie, only to the misery. The ending is so stupid I could not watch it again. All in all I would say skip this movie unless you are a die hard Pee Wee fan which I am not. He was amusing in the bizarre adventure world, but he comes across as rather embarrassing and even creepy in the Big Top.

And I had to watch Big Top (and Big Adventure) a number of times in order to catch and appreciate all of the subtleties.Here is a perspective that might help Pee Wee's movies basically show things from the standpoint of a little kid describing his world once he grows up. For example, a child might imagine that he will have a bicycle that can fly and do all sorts of cool things that in reality are impossible, but he doesn't have the cognitive skills to think about whether things like this are possible. He just makes up his story the way he wants it to be. Pee Wee's movies bring those types of childhood dreams to reality on the screen, with a bunch of unique grown-up humor and some often strange but appropriate music mixed in. Taken from that perspective, these movies are absolutely brilliant.

He looks after his animals and has a tight security lab where he develops wonderful new plants and treatments.  One day a storm hits his town and he finds himself helping out the inhabitants of a travelling circus.  When the town shuns the circus, Pee Wee offers to put them up at his farm.  However the strange and wonderful folks in the circus completely change his life, not to mention the impact beautiful acrobat xxx has.First of all, here's a simple yardstick &#150; if you dislike Reubens' sense of humour, then you'll dislike this film intently.  If you like him then this should be OK.  For the rest of us who fall somewhere in the `indifferent' camp, then this is passable but not much more than that.  To discuss plot is unfair as that is not what this film is about.  However some degree of narrative would have been nice.  Beyond this the film becomes a series of little sketches with a common theme. Of these, some work well and some don't.  There is just about enough off-beat, imaginative humour to keep the film going.  The majority of the scenes are amusing in a weird way, some are laugh out loud funny and some just don't work and drag a bit.  Even if your sense of humour is this way inclined it may be a little thin to satisfy.Reubens is OK, doing his usual camp clowning thing in that same suit.  I don't dislike him and found him funny when he was in a good scene.  Kris Kristofferson is simply a novelty here, he has nothing of substance to do other than be a famous face in a film.  Golino is pretty but doesn't have much humour to bring. The potentially funniest character was the pig, but he didn't get anywhere near enough in the way of lines.Overall this is one for fans, but those who are OK with Herman's humour may get a few laughs.  However, for many, this will be just amusing and may not be worth spending 90 minutes on.

After a violent storm one night the circus (for some reason) washes up on his farm and from there the film just kind of shifts into idle and coasts blandly until the end, in a series of generic circus hi-jinks and weird romantic encounters. Frankly the films' problems exist at the script level. The whole concept was poorly thought out and executed. In Big Adventure Pee Wee's motivation was simple but effective; to get back his bike. The straight-forward premise then allowed the character to be taken from one place to another in fairly rapid succession, all the while letting each unique situation show a different side of him. The road story was also perfect for quickly establishing what Pee Wee is all about; a grown man who cherishes a bicycle more than anything else in his life. It's sweet, it's something we can relate to in one way or another, but it's also very bizarre. Pee Wee is all of those things. Big Top doesn't take him anywhere, it only thrusts him awkwardly into a love story that is completely unwarranted given his emphatic rejections of Dottie in the first movie. I like you, Dottie, LIKE!... I'm a loner, Dottie. A rebel. So whoever decided it would be a brilliant idea to build an entire narrative around Pee Wee Herman having a love-life was totally missing the point of the character.

Talk about a long wait! I spent the entire movie flip-flopping between being shocked and awed. I was awed at the scenario Pee Wee is simply dumped into, having woken up from an over-the-top dream, into an even bigger and more unbelievable circumstance. Then I was summarily shocked by him jumping on Penelope Ann Miller! His talking pig, a circus literally blowing into town and the ringmaster's minuscule mate all provide a zany background to further contrast Pee Wee's oddly adult, normal behavior.The movie plays upon all we know/knew about the character and goes out of its way to misdirect and surprise with virtually every scene. Pee Wee instantly matures into a tender lover (when meeting his true love and 'following his heart'), and ultimately Pee Wee gets engaged to be married. In the previous movie, the Pee Wee we all knew spurns Dottie's advances much as a twelve-year-old would. Pee Wee's late-bloom puberty is creepy but mostly benign, manifested by a hair fetish, the allegorical hot dog tree he's cultivating, and of course numerous obligatory references to intercourse (both verbal and visual).After spending an hour and a half watching him chase his bike, I was ready for this change in pace. This sequel deserves credit at the very LEAST for breaking the sequel syndrome and refusing to poop out another silly romp. And at BEST it can be described as whirlwind hour-and-a-half search for Pee Wee Herman's masculine identity.That's not to say that it was masterfully done. One must forgive the long cuts, boring walking scenes and unnecessary scenes which make this seem almost like an extended second unit director's cut of what could have been a nice hour-long movie. Still it was good fun, and some of the long cuts really worked...such as in the kissing scene by the waterfall. Pee Wee and Gina's snog stretches the premise past the point of shock, into humor, then into disbelief, and again back into humor at the sheer audacity of the cut length. But with other scenes, such as the cheese sandwich scene - the humor just never seems to gel.It seemed Paul Reubens knew with this script that it would be his last shot at working a different angle of his definitive character. Paul had outgrown Pee Wee as an actor, and even if this movie was somehow destined to be a runaway success and more were commissioned, I'm sure he'd pass. What else is there to tell about Pee Wee after the man-child matures? I'm sure it was something of a metamorphosis for Paul, personally.I was happy with this movie, and saw it with the same adult eyes as I had seen tapes of the old stage show long AFTER having seen Playhouse and Big Adventure in my childhood. Even though the roots for the character were more bawdy back in Paul's improv days, my introduction to the character was at its most innocent on Saturday morning TV. This movie served to really complete and close a story to me, in a satisfying and FUNNY way.Plus, Dustin Diamond.

The schoolhouse is one room, the cars are classic models, and the general store looks like a Cracker Barrel restaurant. That was another touch I enjoyed. The townspeople are elderly and reserved, so as to provide the Pee Wee character lots of folks to play off of.The plot involves a circus blowing into town during a big storm. Pee Wee invites them to stay on his farm, and they begin working on a new show. There are two sources of conflict Pee Wee starts to fall for an acrobat, even though he is engaged, and the people in the town don't want the circus around. The way it works out is that Pee Wee and his fiancée break off the engagement and both find new partners. As far as the circus, Pee Wee gives the townspeople magic hot dogs that turn them into children who are then happy to come to the show.

I am not going to explain the rest of the plot so you'll have to see it for yourself. It's just as good as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

The story line also runs smoothly, providing bubbling amounts of sheer joy for the audience members to soak in. See this movie immediately and enjoy it as thoroughly as I did.

Well, one out of two ain't bad, I guess. That first movie was good; this was not. However, the first 10-15 minutes was prime-time Pee Wee Herman weirdness with some very funny dialog and scenes. I thought I got lucky two times in a row but, alas, the story then concentrates on romance between Pee Wee and a circus lady (Valerie Golino). The romance with Golino takes up some much of the rest of the film that the humor goes by the wayside. Hey, the romance is sweet in a way and Golina is pretty woman but I watch this weirdo (Herman) for his outrageous humor not for his romantic stories. Puh-leeeeeze! Speaking of beauty, Penelope Ann Miller also is in here. She and Golina both have beautiful faces, but what's with the teeth? Can't these actresses afford an orthodontist?

A bizarre, repressed man-child of a character. (Or is he simply just a literal child? The character is as mysterious as he is hilarious!) He's always been a personal favorite comedic character of mine, and I've been of fan of his first film Pee-Wee's Big Adventure since I was a child. So when I recently (and finally) had the chance to watch his second feature, Big Top Pee-Wee, I was excited! What new adventures would Pee-Wee get into this time?As it turns out... this film (not really a sequel to the original film or related to his fantastic TV-show) wasn't worth the wait at all, unfortunately.Big Top Pee-Wee is a bizarre, unsettling, strangely boring and distressingly darkly toned big-screen follow-up that somehow is able to turn the delightfully quirky Herman into an unlikable jerk who commits infidelity and loses any and all audience appeal. Oh, and there's a talking pig who almost completely destroys the film on his own. Yup... yup.The film follows Pee-Wee at his new home on an animal farm, where he is conducting chemistry experiments to try and make fruits and vegetables larger, as well as create new breeds of plants, like a Hot-Dog tree. When a circus is suddenly blown into his backyard during a terrible storm, Pee-Wee decides to help them put on a show, despite protests from the nearby town's ruthless elderly residents. Pee-Wee is also torn by his attraction to circus performer Gina (Valeria Golino) and his engagement to a local schoolteacher. (Penelope Ann Miller)On paper, that actually sounds like a cute setup for another twisted, quirky, funny film like the first, but it is just so poorly executed that it sort of implodes under its own weight. And it isn't helped by some really hurtful sequences, including the aforementioned infidelity on Pee-Wee's part, when he all but completely cheats on Ann Miller's character.The acting is, to the film's credit, fantastic. Paul Reubens is great as Pee-Wee, even though the character isn't likable in this film. Valeria Golino is a lot of fun (and very, very sexy) in her role. Penelope Ann Miller is a lot of fun as Pee-Wee's former bride-to-be. And supporting roles by the likes of Kris Kristopherson and Susan Tyrrell are great. The only exception is Wayne White as the voice of Vance, Pee-Wee's talking pig. It's too silly and forced and just doesn't work. The musical score by a returning Danny Elfman is also an absolute blast, and is one of the film's only other saving graces.However, the rest of the production is just flat as a pancake.The script by Reubens and George McGrath is aimless and dull, giving Herman little to do in his own film. Though don't worry, other characters have even less to do than him, so he's still the focus. And as mentioned above, it makes Herman too savage and unlikable. Director Randal Kleiser seems in over his head, and his visual style is just poor all around. Many scenes are boringly shot with the camera just sort of plopped down wherever. The set and costume design is also a huge step down after the prior film, cheapening the overall look.The production and behind-the-scenes work is just too sub-par for this film to function. If this was another Tim Burton film, I think it would have worked a lot better. Because as is, the creative team behind this entry just don't seem like they understand how to make a Pee-Wee Herman film.Sadly, after the fantastic Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, this just felt like a colossal letdown. It's boring, unlikable (borderline loathsome) and poorly-shot, with only a fraction of the creativity of other Pee-Wee projects.Big Top Pee-Wee gets a 3 out of 10. Skip it unless you're a Pee-Wee completionist.

I did not like any parts that were sexual or disgusting especially the part where he fed some birds. I am not one of those people who is impressed with the portrayal of Pee Wee Herman. The elderly townspeople could have been shown more. Of course, the part where Pee Wee gave them what they really needed (see the beginning of part 9 on YouTube) was excellent and things like that would be great for fun entertainment. This movie basically, involves Pee Wee Herman living as a farmer (the farm has some similarities to his playhouse) who is also working on a faster way to produce organic produce (already successful) and even inventing a wiener tree. Eventually, a circus accidentally arrive due to a bad storm and the plans are made for a performance (maybe later ones too) in the area. However, the older townspeople (who are often grumpy) object to the circus and want it to leave their town. Pee Wee tries to join the circus, but gets into trouble when he has relationships with two women.

When I saw there was a sequel, I managed to find the DVD, and just watched it a couple hours ago. Coming with the critics now.The first thing to say, if you're a fan of Pee Wee Herman and you're not a kid, you'll just really enjoy that movie. I laughed for real several times, which is not that easy, as I watch about 300 movies of all kind a year -279 in 2008-, so in my opinion, that's a good point. I won't say this is an adult feature, it's just that contrary to Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Pee Wee's character here is more based on a teenager kind, as sex-related humor and scenes are developed here. To say so, Pee Wee has now a stronger sexual identity than in PWBA, where he was just trying to avoid any close contact with the ladies he now goes for them. That part of Pee Wee is really interesting to see on a movie, as you can imagine with the large amount of comedy Pee Wee carries within him. About the structure of the movie itself, well, it's not that great, it misses the genius part making all of scenes unique and important like in PWBA, as this is not a road-trip but a small town based action, plus some characters are just not enough developed to carry the movie further on. For example, apart from the American-Dreamed-face of Kristofferson, and the simple beauty of Valeria Golino, you won't be deeply touched by their story, not interesting or innovating at all. That's to say it could have been any circus-based comedy, with a talking pig for kids and sex-related visual jokes for adult, which wouldn't worth to be seen, if it was not a Pee Wee Herman story &#x97;the very limited number of them on the big screen makes it a must to see if you love Pee Wee. In a few words, poorly conceived but fun as a Pee Wee movie can be.

Because of that, this movie is really disappointing. When something claims to star Pee-Wee Herman, it only works if Pee-Wee has the spotlight. In this, many scenes featured only circus characters, and all too often, Pee-Wee was playing second banana. The movie itself was very strange. Mr. Herman now owns a farm where his animals cook breakfast every morning, and he has a talking pig sidekick. Where in the last movie, and the new at the time kid's show Pee-Wee was like a little boy and didn't like girls, here he likes them too much. This movie has Pee-Wee humping a woman, making sexual innuendos and possibly losing his virginity. It's not a good movie, though it does have the occasional laugh. Kids might like it, chances are adults won't.My rating ** out of ****.

I think the biggest problem about this film is that instead of the episodic style of the original that placed Pee Wee in so many different situations and meeting so many different types of people, this film is too static. With a more well-defined plot, you are left with the film resting purely on the character of Pee Wee--something I really can't stand for very long. It reminded me an awful lot of PEE WEE'S PLAYHOUSE, in that the going seemed very slow and I just needed a break from the character after a while. This was made worse by a lousy and unfunny script--so it forced Paul Rubens just to mug for the camera again and again! Uggh!
