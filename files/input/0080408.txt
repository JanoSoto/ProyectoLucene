[{"Title":"Roeg's forgotten masterwork","Date":"20 June 2004","Score":"110 out of 135 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  When BAD TIMING A SENSUAL OBSESSION emerged in 1980, its distributor dropped it like a hot potato. Sex! Surgery! Semen stains! Strippers rolling around on meshy overwire! It was all too much for the Rank Organization, a fading production empire with a long history of releasing family classics like GREAT EXPECTATIONS. (Curiously, Rank did sponsor a 'Win a trip to Vienna, location of BAD TIMING!' publicity contest at early bookings). The only reason they financed the picture, allegedly, was for its Freudian-tinged pedigree. When they saw the finished product, they labeled it 'a film about sick people, made by sick people, for sick people.'Deviant psychology is but one of the many twisted pleasures in this tragically neglected masterpiece from '70s visionary Nicolas Roeg. With iconoclastic films like WALKABOUT, DON'T LOOK NOW and MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, Roeg pioneered a new kind of film language. He replaced traditional narrative storytelling with stunning photography, explicit carnality and a signature editing style of jump cuts, cross cuts and subliminal flicker cuts Mixmastered into a mosaic of multiple interpretations. (Unlike today's A.D.D.-inducing overkill, Roeg's fragmentary cutting technique always provided insight into character psychology.) To those of us weaned on art cinema in the '70s and energized by the limitless possibilities of the medium, Nicolas Roeg was (and remains) a god. No filmmaker since has picked up the maverick torch that this deity carried for more than a decade.Trying to encapsulate BAD TIMING's nuanced, character-driven plot is like describing Europe in a postcard. Essentially, it's about an eroticized interpersonal attraction that goes horribly awry, spiraling into jealousy, paranoia and (of course) sexual obsession. Theresa Russell's wild child Milena (the personification of Henry James' headstrong American girl abroad) is compulsively drawn to a fellow Yank stationed in Austria -- the buttoned-down, Freudian shrink/visiting prof Dr. Linden. Their passionate affair has led to a potentially tragic outcome, and it's up to a local police inspector (Harvey Keitel) to sort out what went wrong, why, and whether criminal malice was involved.What makes this relationship drama so compelling is Roeg's structure the film starts in the middle, jumps ahead to the end, then back to the prologue within the first four minutes &#150; and continues in a non-linear fashion until the final shot. It takes us viewers a while to get our bearing, but it also elicits our rapt attention to detail. Never are we certain if the cascading flashbacks are meant to be objective on the filmmaker's part, or the skewed perspective of one of the three main characters. Is Russell a victim, or a tramp? Is Garfunkel a creep, or is that just Keitel's projection? Is Keitel a sympathetic doppelganger, or a crafty manipulator? The stars turn in complex, though off-center performances. Keitel turns miscasting to his advantage; never has he underplayed 'menacing' like he does here. Garfunkel's lack of charisma will turn many viewers off, but he's 100% believable as a shrewd, unstable shrink. Yet it's Russell who's the revelation &#150; those who subscribe to the lazy theory that she can't act will be astonished here. What she may lack in formal technique, she compensates with fearless commitment. Hers may be the most passionate performance by a 21-year old ever captured on film.Tony Richmond's widescreen photography is particularly rich in color and composition (the film's look was based on the art of Gustav Klimt). He shows us a Vienna that's cold, academic, clinical &#150; but electric whenever Russell's on screen. There's a sequence in a university courtyard where he changes lenses, practically from shot to shot, to convey Russell's emotional collapse. (In the background, Keith Jarrett's 'KÃ¶ln Concert' mourns her sad dilemma.) It's a heartbreaking passage, poetically surpassed only by the connecting shot of Garfunkel brooding through a polarized car windshield at daybreak. Frequently Richmond balances the stars' close-ups on the very edge of the screen, which is why the film's power is neutered on cable TV, where 2/3 of the image is lopped off. In that pan-and-scan atrocity, the screen is forever hovering on backgrounds and earlobes.The real tragedy is that BAD TIMING has never been released on any home video format, and I fear it may never happen. It was made at a time when music licenses weren't automatically cleared for home viewing. Considering the eclectic soundtrack incorporates Jarrett, Tom Waits, The Who, Billie Holiday, Harry Partch and others, the idea of renegotiating deals at this point would be any lawyer's nightmare. Even worse, Roeg himself believes the few prints that Rank struck are probably lost or damaged beyond repair, and one fears for the state of the negative. My overlong, effusive review here is a direct plea for a rescue operation. Is any entrepreneurial DVD-releasing outfit willing to salvage this forgotten treasure from obscurity and give it the best letterboxed release possible? Once people are able to see this film as it was intended &#150; for the first time in 24 years or more &#150; I believe its reputation will grow immeasurably. There is simply no other film like it, and, based on current popular trends, nor will there ever be.

Art Garfunkel joins the line (Jagger, Bowie) of singers who produced career best acting performances for this director - the scene of him smoking while staring over a bridge into the abyss of his life is worth buying the dvd alone - and Theresa Russell is simply incendiary. The story is a relatively simple one of how two people who should never have got together become obsessed with each other, but is told in Nicolas Roeg's fluid, labyrinthine style with flashes back and forward and disconcerting edits. The sexual content is extreme for some tastes, but raw and painfully honest in a way which defies simple titillation. Intense work from one of the giants of British and world cinema, now sadly neglected, and one of a string of great films, Performance, Walkabout, Don't Look Now and The Man Who Fell to Earth which mark Nicolas Roeg out as a great director.

My viewpoints of the characters has changed over the years in this complex film.  Art Garfunkel's obsession with Theresa Russell feels more unnerving with each viewing.

It's a film I feel a little guilty about writing so little about, but even on a second viewing it's still rather overwhelming. It's interesting how it manages to be so genuinely multi-layered, more like a novel than a film - the way it mixes voyeurism, spying and emotional, psychological and legal investigation (with Keitel's investigation of the suicide scene placing him firmly in scenes as an unseen voyeur through Terry Rawlings typically brilliant editing) is remarkable enough, but the film manages to do so much more besides. And the performances are incredibly brave - how many leading men can you think of who would effectively (and quite deliberately effeminately) play the woman's role during the lovers' initial meeting? Russell in particular shows an astonishing range in what should be an impossible part, making her inability to find decent roles these days even more disappointing.True it falls apart in the last couple of reels when the performances don't quite ring true, but it's still the last great film Nic Roeg made before settling into prolific mediocrity. It's as a brilliantly edited post-mortem into a mutually destructive relationship rather than a police mystery that it really enthralls, even when it doesn't entirely work. Much more impressive than I remembered, it's not a feelgood movie - if anything it's the date movie from hell - but it is a remarkably ambitious and accomplished one.So why is the film so little-known and perhaps even less-seen? Well, that seems to be down to some bad luck and bad timing of its own.In the US it hit censorship problems and in Europe it had major problems with its distribution. It was one of Rank's last full slate of British productions, so should have been guaranteed a circuit release on the Odeon chain in the UK. Unfortunately, the head of Rank Theatres was so disgusted by the film (the Rank Organisation was originally started to make religious films and many of the old guard were still in place in 1980) that he refused to book it into a single one of their theatres - the only Rank film to be so 'honored' (although he wasn't much enamoured of Eagle's Wing either). The second biggest circuit was owned by Rank's biggest rival, EMI, who weren't interested in helping out their balance sheet, so it ended up on Lew Grade's very small Classic chain. Rank's distribution in Europe was no more enthusiastic.(Of course, Roeg's next film and most expensive, Eureka, had even bigger problems, being pulled a couple of weeks after opening due to a libel lawsuit that kept it on the shelf for years. Since then, despite the not really successful brave try with Cold Heaven, he seems to be little more than a director for hire on a slew of disappointing pictures and cable movies.) As a result, it's hard to track down, but worth the effort if you're looking for challenging fare. Carlton have released a budget DVD in 2.351 in the UK which is an acceptable transfer, but the film remains as elusive as ever elsewhere.

The camera work is amazing and keeps the same pace as the subtle plot lines and aesthetically deft sound score. Harvey Keitel plays a systematically intense police detective who has to unravel the near death of Russell following a harrowing sexual attack and drug overdose. Garfunkel is moody, and sophisticated, while never controlling as much as he is controlled by Ms Russell's ingenuous charms. Quite a psychological thriller, and a movie completely in it's own fresh mold. Anybody coming upon this film for the first time will find themselves drawn into the amazing weave which will entice them, and engage self-sexual questioning that is quite capable of opening one's own sexual subconscious. And, just for a treat. . . it almost seems as if every frame of this film is an art-piece in and of itself.

The film begins with the girl comatose and a detective investigates the circumstances. Through flashbacks, the audience learns a terrifying love story has ended with a criminal act.What makes this film so uncomfortable is that it relentlessly focuses on a time in our lives that most of us would like to forget- that is, the time when you know is relationship is doomed, but you have to wait until it hits rock bottom before you finally part ways. Roeg understands that people can't divorce themselves from their emotions, even when they know intellectually that something is wrong.Although Theresa Russell as Milena is the undoubted star of the film- she simply overpowers everything with her vivacity and directness- special mention must be made of the miscast male leads. Art Garfunkel gives a superb, selfless performance as Alex Linden. Alex is not a sympathetic character. He's a controlling, possessive person who gathers data on his unpremeditating mistress. Even an innocent game (the Luscher color test) ends up as part of a psychological profile that's handed in to a security agency. He's resentful as he watches Milena kiss other men but doesn't confront her about it until she's helplessly sprawled on the floor. He never relaxes except in post-coital moments and he becomes frustrated that Milena is untamed, unmarriageable and has a past that she won't share or give up.Harvey Keitel is very charismatic, if unconvincing as an Austrian detective. His performance as the moralistic Inspector Netusil (the name refers to somebody who knows everything who knows one small detail) does not soften the arrogance or the self-righteousness of the character. A thorough investigator who knows that there's more to the case than a suicide attempt- he says plainly How, Dr. Linden, do you account for a girl getting in such a state- drugs, depressions? Milena is somebody who has no idea who has no idea what she wants out of life, sees pleasure as an end in itself and is prone to bouts of melodrama and selfishness. The best scene in the film is her drunken outburst at her uncaring lover We are celebrating the death of the Milena and the birth of the Milena you do want. It's a powerful sequence, but it begs the question- why would this beautiful, intelligent girl let herself get so messed up? Beautifully shot by Roeg's regular cinematographer Anthony Richmond and filled with small, telling moments (e.g. the handwritten note that says I wish you understood me less and loved me more), this is a picture that demands multiple viewings. Roeg at his peak made the busiest films of all time- they're bursting at the seams with ideas and this film, often shocking and heartbreaking, is one of his most accessible. It's unfortunate that this brilliant movie is not more well known- maybe Roeg was right when he said people don't like it when you hold a mirror to their face.

It's about a destructive love affair between a man played by Art Garfunkel and a woman played by Theresa Russel. Russel has attempted to commit suicide. In the hospital they're fighting for her life as Garfunkel is interrogated by a detective (Harvey Keitel) about what really happened. Slowly the real story unfolds and the viewer learns about the darker sides in both characters.Roeg switches back and forth in the chronology of the story and that makes Bad Timing an intriguing but difficult movie. The secrets that are uncovered are very shocking but one can still 'empathize' (if not sympathize) with the characters.In my opinion it's about stretching the line between good intentions and evil doings. The good part is that you can't really tell in which moment the line is crossed.See it and then see it again.

It is sustained by questions of doubt, tension, expectation. The solidity of the hand is strengthened by the slipperiness underfoot.So suppose you wanted to make a film about the fields that animate your anchor relationships. You couldn't do what everyone else does deal with the tokens the looks, the physical moving away of bodies and then re-entering. You want it to have the passion it deserves, which is a tricky thing the passion in the relationships between the film and the viewer has to be based on the same field of passion between lovers. That field requires faith to overcome doubt. This need for investing in love as a counter to the doubts about love is what drives us, with religion and tribalisms as mere side effects.Roeg wanted to do this. During a certain sweet spot in his career, he could shape any story into this, a story about what makes story. And to do it all by cinematic misdirection. This isn't Last Year at Marienbad, which is abstract. This is internal, subconscious, but with the real fleshy stuff we actually dream in.Some viewers will think this is a simple detective story. Bad guy lies; insistent detective catches him. It is all about sequence, the timing of the title. What happens first; how the thing is explained.But I believe this is something much more important. Like Roeg's other films, these are dreams. The things that happen here &#x97; that we see &#x97; drift close to what actually happens, and then away being more like imagined fears. It is all about urges; the grandest passions rest on a collection of urges, most of which slip into uncontrollable futures.I will advise you to approach this as something that goes on in the character's soul. Polanski and Kiesloswki have the same relationship to reality, but here we work closer to image and the uncontrollable ends. The overall shape of thing is a love affair, one that is deep and all-consuming. The hero/filmmaker's mind has some tools that allow us to enter the world of dreams&#x97; He is a research psychoanalyst in Vienna. This is the most unlikely of cities for intellect, and even today produces ideas that fold in on themselves in tightly wound ways. Roeg quotes The Third Man a bit, and assembles a number of Austrian artifacts, all having something to do with control. It is Wittgenstein in his first period.&#x97; He is a spy. He lectures about spies. He spies on patients as a theorist of obsession. He literally works for a spy agency, spying on the woman, who in other identities he is falling in love with. This is Wittgenstein in his second period, having renounced the genius of his knotted mind and theories of word play as mazes.&#x97; He is a detective, instanced as a second being, a sort of Fight Club alter ego that examines himself from the outside. This is Wittgenstein in his third, suicidal period, where his work was on himself. He literally builds a container, a house, here a film. Harvey Keitel since Taxi Driver understood the idea of playing and imagined other. Garfunkle's cluelessness as a person and actor is overwhelmed by him, just as that part of the character's mind is.These three fight for control of self over a woman. The film is so effective, and so energetically unsprung that there is a fourth layer outside. Roeg himself developed an obsession over this woman, falling deeply in love with her. (He would marry her.) The visual storytelling, the editing, the timeshifting, the identity swapping, the depth of texture could not have been as effective were he not obsessively in love in the three ways of the doctor.The genius of starting with Tom Waits and ending with Jarrett's Koln concert is by itself enough to make this an essential experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.

His first two films as sole director were both excellent ones, Walkabout from 1971 and Don't Look Now from 1973, but I have never cared for his third film, the overlong, confusing and self-consciously arty The Man who Fell to Earth.Bad Timing, made in 1980, was Roeg's fourth film. The narrative is non-linear in the extreme. It opens with a young American woman, Milena Vognic, being rushed to hospital in Vienna after a drug overdose, probably a suicide attempt. In a series of flashbacks we learn about Milena's past- her marriage to her older Czech husband Stefan, from whom she is estranged (it is not made clear whether they are actually divorced), and her stormy relationship with her boyfriend Alex, an American-born lecturer at Vienna University. Intercut with these are scenes showing Milena lying in the hospital and showing Alex being interviewed by a detective who suspects him of foul play.Roeg suffered the misfortune of seeing his film disowned by its distributor, the Rank Organisation, who denounced it as a film about sick people, made by sick people, for sick people. (I say misfortune, but I suspect that actually a lot of art-house directors would regard criticism like that as a badge of honour). What upset them was presumably the explicit sex scenes, although Rank really should have known what to expect from Roeg. He was, after all, the man responsible for Don't Look Now, with its controversial love scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.In one respect, however, Rank's criticism is accurate; Bad Timing is indeed a film about sick people. Milena and Alex are clearly, psychologically speaking, damaged goods. Their relationship is essentially a sadomasochistic one- not physical sadomasochism but a form of emotional sadomasochism involving both mutual desire and mutual loathing. The film can be seen as a psychological case-study; it is significant that psychology is the subject which Alex teaches, and also that the film is set in Vienna, the city of Freud.I have nothing against non-linear narration in principle; it can often be an effective (sometimes the most effective) way of telling a story. It is, moreover, not necessarily a modernist or avant-garde idea. Those who think of it as an invention of the French Nouvelle Vague of the sixties should watch John Brahm's The Locket from 1946, a film with a particularly intricate flashback within a flashback within a flashback structure. (That film was also a psychological case study). In the case of Bad Timing, however, the film's narrative structure makes it confusing and difficult to follow. Although it aims at a psychological study of the two main characters, we do not learn enough about them to enable us to understand them. I was left wanting to know more about the background to Milena's relationship with Alex (and, even more, about her rather mysterious relationship with Stefan). As the critic of Variety put it, most of the milestones are missing from the characters' tortuous psychological route.Another criticism I would have would be the casting of Art Garfunkel as Alex. Much as I admire Garfunkel for his musical achievements, he was not, on the evidence of this film, much of an actor. Roeg clearly liked using rock stars in his films, because the leading role in The Man who Fell to Earth is taken by David Bowie, an equally unsuccessful piece of casting. (To be fair to Bowie, he was to give better performances in some of his later films).The gorgeous Theresa Russell, who was later to become Roeg's wife, is better as Milena, and, as is often the case with Roeg, there are some striking visual touches. Overall, however, Bad Timing is the sort of experimental film which reminds us that not every experiment, whether in science or the arts, is a successful one. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Two Neurotics Duke It Out","Date":"18 November 2002","Score":"31 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Director Nicolas Roeg has managed to take a half hour story and extend it for 129 minutes.  What you see in Bad Timing is a series of contests between two of the most neurotic lovers outside of Damage from 1992. The main characters are a professor of psychiatry, appropriately, and a young woman who demands that others allow her to live for the moment.  Scene after scene we watch these two attempt to dominate each other.  Their sexual couplings make the bed into an arena of emotional endurance. The loser is left crying or pleading and the winner, always unsatisfied, wants still more.The film, rather than having a plot, is a process.  We watch -- my excuse was to wait for a plot -- this sickness for over two hours and find no redemption for the characters nor for us.  No reward exists at the end of the shabby rainbow.As for mechanics, Art Garfunkle, who plays the professor, has the depth and spice of a soda cracker. He attempts to play a passionate playboy, but I can never quite get The Sounds of Silence out of my head.  Funky and quirky Jeremy Irons, would have been a perfect choice for the part. The talented Harvey Keitel, here a sadly dysfunctional police detective, is wasted with lines dripping psycho-babble as he pleads with the professor during an interrogation.  Theresa Russell, who plays the object of the professor's obsession, is given the only good lines in the film.  Her role is so well-portrayed that her character occasionally engages our sympathy.If you are in the mood for some pretentious nonsense, or want to give Art Garfunkel one more chance, check this one out.

Apparently some things went wrong with the distribution and the dark content of the movie was probably not what they were used to see at that time either. Does that mean that it is a bad movie? Far from it, the story for instance is multi-layered, interesting and quite impressive.It all starts with a young American woman who is brought to a hospital in Vienna after a suicide attempt by overdosing on pills. But the police detective that investigates the case suspects that there is more going on than what her lover, an American psychology professor, wants to admit. As the doctors do everything possible to save the woman's life, the professor is thoroughly interrogated by the detective. Through a series of flashbacks, we see how the relationship between the two started and evolved and what that had to do with the suicide attempt. Everything will be shown their passionate sexual relationship, her drinking problem, the numerous affairs that both have, her hidden marriage...As I already said, this is a multi-layered story. For me, that makes this movie only more interesting, but I have the feeling that not that many people can cope with it, as today we are only used to see straight and easy stories which don't demand too much of our brains. This movie combines all kinds of aspects like espionage during the Cold War, romance, thriller, drama,... but always feels like one solid film. That only proves the skills of the director and the screenwriter of course. It was the first time that I saw a movie from the hand of director Nicolas Roeg and Yale Udoff is a complete stranger to me as well. But together they made the entire story work.The fact that this is such a solid movie also has a lot to do with the good acting. Not that I expected anything else from people like Harvey Keitel and Theresa Russell, but Art Garfunkel certainly surprised me. Normally I don't like all those singers / would-be actors who only appear in movies to get the movie a larger audience (not that it worked this time) and not because they know anything about acting. But when their performance is OK, I'll be the first one to admit it as well and so I say here that Art Garfunkel was really very good in this movie.Overall this is a very good movie with an interesting story and some very fine acting. It's too bad that it isn't better known, because it certainly deserves to be seen by a much larger audience. I give this movie at least a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.

Harvey Keitel, on the other hand, was not Roeg's first choice for Inspector Netusil the role had previously been offered to Albert Finney and Bruno Ganz (both of whom turned it down) and Malcolm McDowell (who was unavailable).

Despite her young age and the complexity of the character she was playing, the stunning Theresa Russell - who turned down SUPERMAN (1978) to do this but, ironically, is now currently engaged on SPIDER-MAN 3! - is simply astonishing in the film and she should by rights have become a huge star because of it; as it is, she ended up being criminally underused and her career has subsequently been disappointingly uneven.While the film's working title was ILLUSIONS, its eventual title could be referring to the chance meeting between Garfunkel and Russell at a party (had either of them left earlier, they might never have met), to Garfunkel's inexplicably sluggish movements on the night of Russell's suicide attempt (which are under Keitel's dogged scrutiny) or even to estranged husband Denholm Elliott's reporting of Russell's recovery just as Garfunkel is about to break down under Keitel's relentless questioning and confess to his ravishment of her while she was practically comatose. Tragically, Garfunkel's plight in the film was eerily mirrored in real-life towards the end of shooting when his own girlfriend Laurie Bird - whose brief acting career included two films for Monte Hellman, TWO-LANE BLACKTOP (1971) and COCKFIGHTER (1974) - committed suicide in their apartment. Clearly one of Roeg's most personal films, BAD TIMING is not only a harrowing study of male-female relationships or more precisely l'amour fou, but is also another depiction by Roeg (as had been the case with all his previous pictures) of characters stranded in a foreign land, in this case two Americans in Vienna. In hindsight, the tumultuous and almost deadly Garfunkel-Russell relationship is mirrored in the one between Garfunkel and Keitel, especially in the film's latter stages when the interrogation and subsequent revelation take center stage; the latter sequences, then, are capped by an enigmatic ending - due to Elliott's nick-of-time appearance and subsequent dematerialization - could this be a figment of Garfunkel's agitated state of mind? BAD TIMING is shot in Roeg's typically fragmented style which, this time around, can perhaps be explained by the fact that the narrator (Art or Theresa) is under a lot of emotional (Keitel's interrogation of Art) and physical (Theresa's life-saving surgery) strain. In another sense, BAD TIMING can even be seen as a sophisticated precursor to the erotic thrillers so prevalent in filmdom from the late-80s onwards.For the third consecutive time, Anthony Richmond serves as director of photography for Roeg and the film also boasts a splendidly eclectic soundtrack - Billy Holliday, Keith Jarrett, The Who, Tom Waits, not to mention some typical Viennese zither music a' la THE THIRD MAN (1949) - an inspired choice to be sure but, ironically, the prohibitive rights issue costs were also one of the reasons why BAD TIMING has been out of the public eye for so long.The Criterion DVD is therefore a very welcome introduction for me to this essential film. Intriguingly, it transpires that the film's backers, The Rank Organization, dubbed BAD TIMING a sick film by sick people for sick people and subsequently not only dropped their famous gong logo from the credit titles but refused to show it in their chain of theaters! Interestingly, the outline of the story emerged from an aborted collaboration between Roeg and famed Italian producer Carlo Ponti. Disappointingly, unlike Criterion's other Roeg DVDs, WALKABOUT (1971) and THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, there is no Audio Commentary to be found here although Roeg is in a jovial mood in the accompanying interview. Also, a couple of the deleted scenes were quite good, particularly one in which Russell crashes a party and embarrasses Garfunkel with her drunken and lewd antics. For the record, during the four-year hiatus between THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and BAD TIMING, Roeg had been connected with several high-profile projects which were eventually helmed by other people, namely FLASH GORDON (Mike Hodges, 1980), HAMMETT (Wim Wenders, 1982) and OUT OF Africa (Sydney Pollack, 1985). Unfortunately, Roeg's decline has proved to been one of the saddest in recent memory but his two current productions - PUFFBALL and ADINA - sound promising at least and hopefully they will come to fruition eventually! Actually, after this viewing of BAD TIMING, I regret not purchasing Roeg's previous film, THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, when Deep Discount DVD had their recent Criterion sale. However, I should be giving Roeg's subsequent film, (also starring his then wife Theresa Russell) EUREKA (1984), a first look via my VHS copy; actually, had it not been for the recent interview with the still gorgeous Russell conducted for the BAD TIMING DVD, I wouldn't have known that Roeg and Russell had separated!

The use of music is effective if not as good, I suspect, as it could have been . The film falls down in three areas the script, the acting and the length. The script is repetetive, often incoherent and tends towards the insular and melodramatic. The theme of relationships is done to death there is no hinterland, just a monotonous unpersuasive intensity. The acting is a mixture. Not enough is made of Harvey Keitel and Denholm Elliott's talents. The crucial part is handed to Art Garfunkel, who, while not awful, is barely adequate. What was Roeg thinking there? Theresa Russell, however, gives one of her finest performances as an unstable woman. Where the film finally fails is in the way it drags on and on, with no real point and certainly few memorable scenes. The viewer is battered into submission by the repetitive, droning unsavouryness of it all. Not by any stretch of the imagination an enjoyable film.

Garfunkel's not exactly a wimp...there's some steel in his gaze. My Milena was just as magnetic and beautiful as Theresa Russell...really. My Milena also lived in a sordid, messy, sexy aerie with a big bed, overfull ashtrays, half-read books everywhere. The alcohol? Check. The infidelity? Check. The suicide attempts? Check. The much older other man? Check. The sleazy, disgusting party friends? Check. The late-night drunk calls that may or may not have been suicide attempts? Check. The intense sex that regularly turned into something twisted? Check. Just like Garfunkel I was hooked...just like Garfunkel I had a together life...my God, I even study psychoanalysis...and just like Garfunkel there was more than a hint of bad faith in the togetherness I opposed to my Milena's sloppiness. Like Garfunkel, the idea that Milena had other lovers made me crazy...like Theresa Russell, my Milena needed secrets...lies...she couldn't breathe without her lies and secrets.The scene where she sets Garfunkel up with her fake suicide attempt only to loose the full force of her hysterical cruelty on him...check...down to the blows and the broken bottles...and it marked the moment our love died, even if things dribbled on for a while after that.

That's the secret of a great movie you feel like it's talking to you and to you alone. I have a feeling I'm not the only person who walked out of the cinema feeling like he had just seen his own life on the screen. Almost everything is perfect. This film is even more disturbing than DON'T LOOK NOW. That is saying a lot. The one wrong note for me was Harvey Keitel.

It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. Bad Timing's psychologist Alex Linden (Garfunkel) would no doubt describe his ex-lover, the brazen blonde Milena Flaherty (Russell) in exactly the same glowing terms.It's also a charge critics have levelled at Bad Timing since 1980 (they usually leave the 'exquisite' bit off), citing its pseudo-intellectualism, along with a subplot featuring Denholm Elliot that runs out of wool - though he does comically pop his head round thedoor at the end, in yet another case of 'bad timing'.But back to the cigarettes for a moment this film is absolutely choking, fair reeking in ciggie smoke; over 40 cigarettes have the life sucked out of them during the two-hour running time. I wanted them all to smoke, said director Nic Roeg. Nervousness. Smokers (who ought not to attempt a Withnail And I-style 'smoking game' lest they pass out and choke to death on their own nicotiney vomit) are advised to watch it from the comfort of the living room with an enormous ashtray to hand.The cigarettes aren't just a handy visual shorthand for obsessive compulsion, which is the meat and potatoes of Bad Timing, they also form a crucial part of the evidence that will damn Alex. Having discovered a suicidal Milena (Russell) expiring from a booze and pills overdose, a very advanced toxic condition, as the medics have it, why would he (apparently) pass the time puffing away, filling her ashtray with butts for over an hour before calling the ambulance round? It's the job of Inspector Netusil (Keitel), Alex's inquisitor-cum-conscience, to find out what really happened in that mysterious 60-minute window.What Netusil intuits, and what is finally revealed to us - no lesser voyeurs than the characters herein - is predictable if unflinchingly graphic (you may never hear 'Bright Eyes' the same way again). The cause of the film's one-time censorship (Bad Timing's sickened producers Rank banned it from their own Odeon cinemas) was succinctly summed up by Big Audio Dynamite in their unlikely chart hit 'E = MC2', Mick Jones' homage to Roeg's films She's my flame too hot to hold, had to settle for her cold. Set in Vienna, the birthplace of psychoanalysis, Bad Timing has been described as Freudian cinema with a vengeance; Hitchcock with knobs on. Alternately draggy, horrible, then almost unbearable to watch, it's permeated with the kind of decadence, anguished eroticism and self-analysis (cue much poring over the LÃ¼scher Colour Test) associated with fin-de-siÃ¨cle Vienna the paintings of Freud's contemporaries Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele are featured heavily, as is Roeg's trademark non-linear, free-associative direction, less effective here than in Don't Look Now.Depending on one's tolerance for shouty, duvet-chewing acting, the lead performances will either grimly fascinate (perhaps evoking happy memories of past doomed relationships), possibly amuse, or most likely irritate beyond belief, until you're seized by the desire to violently bang the heads of everyone involved together.As Alex, Garfunkel is a modern monster. A neat freak and control freak-turned-voyeur (early in the film, he observes to his student class that a guilt-ridden voyeur is usually a political conservative) his idea of a chat-up line is, If we don't meet, there's always the possibility it could have been perfect. Or, on the lovers in Klimt's 'The Kiss', They're happy... because they don't know each other well enough yet. It's a wonder he manages to get anyone in the sack, alive or half-dead.For Alex, who desires to dominate with rationalism, Milena is simply another case study to be observed, enjoyed at leisure, tagged and ultimately cast back into the community on a long leash. He's only a masochist's idea of a bridge over troubled water. Fortunately for Alex, Milena is just such a masochist neurotic, chaotic, living for the moment and prone to hurling beer bottles off the windowsill in a drunken fury while dressed as a kind of prostitute-clown.A pivotal, and pretty representative exchange, sees a hopeful Alex nipping round, our blousey anti-heroine atypically fending him off as she's not in the mood, Alex storming out, Milena chasing after him and offering herself to him on the apartment stairs. Wasting no time, our shrink plunges straight in, then saunters off without a by-or-leave, while Milena trudges miserably back indoors. As a sympathetic Netusil, like the chairman at a male assertiveness meeting, despairs, They're dangerous creatures, to themselves and others... they try to drag us into their confusion and chaos. Poor old Alex can only seethe unhappily at his shoes, as an unconscious Milena gets a bloody tracheotomy pipe plugged into her neck.This is one of the bleakest films in Roeg's canon, which is saying something; ushered in to the grizzled strains of Tom Waits' 'Invitation To The Blues', and closing with Billie Holiday's 'The Same Old Story', via Daltrey and Townshend's 'Who Are You' - although Elvis Costello's 'Two Little Hitlers' would have worked just as well Two Little Hitlers will fight it out until/one little Hitler does the other one's will.

Or at least is fond of entering troubled minds. His biggest quality is something i value a lot in a filmmaker he paints his canvas, but he also designates where we seat to look at it. He builds the atmosphere and makes us a spaceship to enter it. That's our feeling. But than there's something more interesting he does. We think we are comfortable as the designated watchers of what he depicts, but what he does, mostly through camera work and editing (which is great in this film) is trying to push us into the game, and going through the same risks and trouble of the characters in the film. That will to place the viewer at the center of what matters is commonly tried these days, but i think Roeg was a visionary in his days, and that includes this film.We have a psychoanalyst, which is a shortcut for saying he is someone who works relations inside out. He is obsessed, has retroactive jealousy, and the film is the evolution of how he fights himself to make a convenient story that allows him to be with the woman, something he eventually fails to do. We know how the thing ends from the beginning, so the film uses the form of allowing us to know the ending point and than driving as in flashback to that point. The editing is frantic and somehow psychedelic, something Roeg might have learned in his London 60' experience. And the intention was precisely to make our visual mind work like the troubled mind of Garfunkel's character.An extra significant point, something Ted Goranson really likes to notice, and which i'm starting to fall for is the empathy Roeg has with the actress, Theresa Russell, which would lead to marriage. You really can understand that. Her character is not the center of the story, it's all about Garfunkel, but we miss that unless we think about that. Garfunkel's character was at this point a representative of Roeg's urges for this beautiful woman.The film that best portrays this relation, and simultaneously is Roeg's best, to me, is Insignificance. This Bad Timing is one of his most celebrated, but it has minor power compared to the other one.

Theresa's character is very lifelike and (despite the character's flaws, both obvious and subtle) also quite sympathetic.This is not an easy film to watch. For one thing, it's rather non-linear, and flits around between several different times and places. Rather than telling a story as such, it's more of a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces of which are revealed and placed one at a time. For another, it's actually rather unnerving to watch the process of her dissolution, both due to how realistically it's shown and the fact that we want to like Malena (or at least I did).If you're at all a fan of Russell, I think you'll find that this is one of her best performances ever, and the direction and staging are first-rate.(It was also a bit weird to see Harvey Keitel with long hair.)

Art Garfunkel's performance however, remains authentic and true to life right till the end with an extraordinary level of concentration. He is brilliantly able to show simply thinking, often looking off screen in a state of enigmatic contemplation. It is one of the all time great screen performances and he sadly became an untapped resource in the business.The constant smoking in the film was rumoured to be an early example of product placement (thanks, I only smoke these) but the director subsequently denied this, claiming it was meant to dramatise the nervousness of the assortment of neurotic characters. I think it would have been more effective if we hadn't seen what ultimately transpired between the two leads in the film, leaving us to speculate as to whether a line had been crossed into moral horror. This unwillingness to trust the audience and go for the explicit in order to shock is one of the great failings of modern cinema. some commentator at the time described 'Bad Timing' as 'a sick film, made by sick people for sick audiences', but although it's often meretricious, the adults depicted are recognizably that of the real world.

Bad Timing is one of his most complex works. It's a multi-layered and fragmented story about a relationship that gradually goes out of control ending horribly. As is the way with Roeg, editing is hugely important. In this instance the editing is used to cut and paste the narrative in a very non-linear fashion so that the story comes at us with contrasting jarring emotional changes. It's overall a very intense film to watch. One of those that only really settles into your mind once it's over. It's a very adult film with frank sexuality and complex psychology going on throughout. At times it's very unpleasant and it isn't really very surprising it met with some censorship issues. It's equally not too hard to see why it was a commercial failure too. While admittedly the distribution problem it had could not have helped, it's not really a film that has any lightness to it. It's an unremittingly bleak story with almost no humour. This isn't intended as a criticism just an observation.The two principal actors do well with pretty difficult material. It's often sexually very explicit although never erotic. It must've taken some bravery for the leads to act these roles. Although I do expect sexually frank imagery from Nicolas Roeg, on the other hand I wasn't entirely prepared for seeing Art Garfunkel's gonads. But as I say this material is never sensationalized although it does ultimately end in a sex scene that is certainly very grim indeed. However, the main thrust of the narrative, such as it is, is the exploration of a mutually destructive relationship. Roeg's style of bold editing is very well suited to tell this fragmented story. Despite the subject of young lovers it's certainly not a romance. It's way too downbeat for that. If you've just started dating someone, this is not the film to watch together.

One is never quite sure whether Harvey Keitel's detective is a manifestation of guilt and the super-ego or a real on-the-trail policeman; in the end it doesn't matter, as the man in question is forced to face his own reality as a life-denying entity.The ending, as with Performance, shows a fragile human consciousness being driven off to their doom in a car which appears to be the manifestation of a post-modern world in which they are desperately lost.

I think...","Date":"7 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Bad Timing is Nicholas Roeg's film about a relationship that is fueled by an obsessive passion, more or less, on both sides, and ends in a kind of mutual destruction. This has been fodder for many an independent film, but Roeg and his screenwriter attempt the material with a twist (Roeg, perhaps in his own distinct sensibility as an auteur, more-so). They're attempting to dissect it by a manner that goes along with how a mind works through a relationship after the fact, through memories of what worked, what didn't at all, what's foggy, what's crazy, subtle bits that connect more directly to others, and essentially reveals as much as any one person can think about the individuals in their link. Throw in a little detective/criminal mystery entanglement, some trademark Roeg editing and narrative technique, and sprinkle some of the most appropriately steamy (and appropriately disturbing) mature sexual context in a movie since Last Tango, and you've got a sort of cult classic.It's the kind of work that, as someone who loves getting a filmmaker who approaches things from a skewed perspective almost like an intellectual, is nearly inspiring. I didn't gain mind-blowing Bergmanesque insights into the realm of a torn relationship, but it's enough to squash competition that might show up late at night on IFC. It deals with a psychology professor, Alex Linden (Art Garfunkel, the most unlikely of male leads for a sexually charged and complex individual, but out-does his previous turn in Carnal Knowledge as a subtle performer of a man in total emotional crisis), and his romance with young Milena (the extraordinary Theresa Russel, arguably her best performance to date, soul pouring out like it's her one and only chance to shine), who is possibly already married to a much older man across the Vienna border (Denhalm Elliot, great in his few scenes).They have powerful lust and some good times, even in Morocco of all places, but... they just don't click, due to Alex not being able to let go of what Milena does, almost in a every breath you take style (watch as the Who's Who Are You is used in the most stirring effect imaginable). Without saying too much, something terrible happens to Milena, a hospital stay occurs, and an investigation (overnight, of course) happens between a detective (long-haired Harvey Keitel, compelling even when it's only in the smallest, two-note spurts) which leads to a test of pure existential upheaval. But Roeg firstly approaches the style like it's a shuffleboard of images and scenes, moods and thoughts, and it's a wonderful experiment in subjective approach. Many post-modern filmmakers only wish to try and make a film dealing with genre (i.e. crime/gangsters) like this, but Roeg does it sometimes subliminally, cut-aways implying sexual interaction and obsession that go the opposite way of the pondering style of a Last Tango (i.e. the operation scene, a cut-away between a tense gynecological exam during surgery and sex).The other thing that Roeg wisely does, as he did do sort of in Walkabout, is to let the actors play up to their strengths. While it was trickier to to as a director, and to actually notice in the finished product, in Walkabout, in Bad Timing there are countless scenes where we see the actors tapping into the characters full-throttle, and revealing little layers in the script that wouldn't be present in a more conventional treatment. It's simple to say this kind of material would get shut out at the door in Hollywood. Sure it would; it's a tale where lurid details (and truly disturbing ones, more-so for how they linger in the mind than how they're shown) seem to mask the more vulnerable shades of the story. But it's difficult to say that it might have more appeal than the one infamous quote a sick movie made by sick people for sick people seems to suggest.It is rough going at times, and not your grandmother's story of love gone awry. But it challenges perceptions and tries to pierce through certain concepts of what men expect from women and women expect from men the lies, the hiding, being open, being free, being who we are in front of one another. At the end, what is the bond in a relationship? Do we know one another really? Roeg leaves it up to us to decide... in his sick way. And it's one of my favorites of 1980.

"},{"Title":"Invitation To The Blues","Date":"11 November 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" A cigarette, said Oscar Wilde, is the perfect type of the perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. Bad Timing's psychologist Alex Linden (Garfunkel) would no doubt describe his ex-lover, the brazen blonde Milena Flaherty (Russell) in exactly the same glowing terms.It's also a charge critics have levelled at Bad Timing since 1980 (they usually leave the 'exquisite' bit off), citing its pseudo-intellectualism, along with a subplot featuring Denholm Elliot that runs out of wool - though he does comically pop his head round thedoor at the end, in yet another case of 'bad timing'.But back to the cigarettes for a moment this film is absolutely choking, fair reeking in ciggie smoke; over 40 cigarettes have the life sucked out of them during the two-hour running time. I wanted them all to smoke, said director Nic Roeg. Nervousness. Smokers (who ought not to attempt a Withnail And I-style 'smoking game' lest they pass out and choke to death on their own nicotiney vomit) are advised to watch it from the comfort of the living room with an enormous ashtray to hand.The cigarettes aren't just a handy visual shorthand for obsessive compulsion, which is the meat and potatoes of Bad Timing, they also form a crucial part of the evidence that will damn Alex. Having discovered a suicidal Milena (Russell) expiring from a booze and pills overdose, a very advanced toxic condition, as the medics have it, why would he (apparently) pass the time puffing away, filling her ashtray with butts for over an hour before calling the ambulance round? It's the job of Inspector Netusil (Keitel), Alex's inquisitor-cum-conscience, to find out what really happened in that mysterious 60-minute window. What Netusil intuits, and what is finally revealed to us - no lesser voyeurs than the characters herein - is predictable if unflinchingly graphic (you may never hear 'Bright Eyes' the same way again). The cause of the film's one-time censorship (Bad Timing's sickened producers Rank banned it from their own Odeon cinemas) was succinctly summed up by Big Audio Dynamite in their unlikely chart hit 'E = MC2', Mick Jones' homage to Roeg's films She's my flame too hot to hold, had to settle for her cold. Set in Vienna, the birthplace of psychoanalysis, Bad Timing has been described as Freudian cinema with a vengeance; Hitchcock with knobs on. Alternately draggy, horrible, then almost unbearable to watch, it's permeated with the kind of decadence, anguished eroticism and self-analysis (cue much poring over the LÃ¼scher Colour Test) associated with fin-de-siÃ¨cle Vienna the paintings of Freud's contemporaries Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele are featured heavily, as is Roeg's trademark non-linear, free-associative direction, less effective here than in Don't Look Now.Depending on one's tolerance for shouty, duvet-chewing acting, the lead performances will either grimly fascinate (perhaps evoking happy memories of past doomed relationships), possibly amuse, or most likely irritate beyond belief, until you're seized by the desire to violently bang the heads of everyone involved together.As Alex, Garfunkel is a modern monster. A neat freak and control freak-turned-voyeur (early in the film, he observes to his student class that a guilt-ridden voyeur is usually a political conservative) his idea of a chat-up line is, If we don't meet, there's always the possibility it could have been perfect. Or, on the lovers in Klimt's 'The Kiss', They're happy... because they don't know each other well enough yet. It's a wonder he manages to get anyone in the sack, alive or half-dead.For Alex, who desires to dominate with rationalism, Milena is simply another case study to be observed, enjoyed at leisure, tagged and ultimately cast back into the community on a long leash. He's only a masochist's idea of a bridge over troubled water. Fortunately for Alex, Milena is just such a masochist neurotic, chaotic, living for the moment and prone to hurling beer bottles off the windowsill in a drunken fury while dressed as a kind of prostitute-clown.A pivotal, and pretty representative exchange, sees a hopeful Alex nipping round, our blousey anti-heroine atypically fending him off as she's not in the mood, Alex storming out, Milena chasing after him and offering herself to him on the apartment stairs. Wasting no time, our shrink plunges straight in, then saunters off without a by-or-leave, while Milena trudges miserably back indoors. As a sympathetic Netusil, like the chairman at a male assertiveness meeting, despairs, They're dangerous creatures, to themselves and others... they try to drag us into their confusion and chaos. Poor old Alex can only seethe unhappily at his shoes, as an unconscious Milena gets a bloody tracheotomy pipe plugged into her neck.This is one of the bleakest films in Roeg's canon, which is saying something; ushered in to the grizzled strains of Tom Waits' 'Invitation To The Blues', and closing with Billie Holiday's 'The Same Old Story', via Daltrey and Townshend's 'Who Are You' - although Elvis Costello's 'Two Little Hitlers' would have worked just as well Two Little Hitlers will fight it out until/one little Hitler does the other one's will.

The story of an attempted suicide of a woman (Theresa Russell) and the following investigation where his boyfriend (Art Garfunkel) faces the suspicion of an obsessed detective (Harvey Keitel) is set in a Vienna filmed with taste and style and told in a non-chronological manner that builds the story in an a series of interleaved present and flashback scenes. The best parts of the movie are these where the actors are left to rather freely build the relationship of lust and mis-communication between Russell and Garfunkel, and the suspicion mind-game between Garfunkel and Keitel. Less convincing is the plot itself, it looks like after setting the story and putting the characters in motion the director and script writer did not really know how to end it at the level of interest they succeeded to build. Garfunkel itself in the middle of the story looks a little uncertain, this is by far his most important role on screen but his lack of confidence fits well a character who is supposed to look like he cannot make his mind in a relationship. Although this film came a little too early it set the rules and establish the ground for a niche genre that has developed a few years after it, and despite the aging of some gadgets and equipment and the intense smoking that looks now so outdated -) by its characters it does not look too tired or rusty, quite the opposite. Actually if I am to compare it with Basic Instinct (certainly with the second one, but maybe also with the first) Bad Timing is a better movie.

But you have to give Russell credit for her candid and powerful performance in this film, a contrast to Garfunkel's not particularly attractive coolness. What you keep wondering watching Bad Timing, is what the heck Russell sees in him.Garfunel agonizes over deep existential questions despite his own lust for Russell -- and forgive me for not using the character names, for I'm only talking about their roles, not their reality. At one point, they're on an exotic vacation in a steamy mid-East and he agonizes. Look at where we are, she tells him, although he remains oblivious. This film makes An Affair to Remember, and assorted Nora Ephron films look like the pablum they are.Similarly, in that scene on the stairway, she lifts her skirts and tells him, This is what you want, isn't it? Sometimes things are both simpler than we think and more complex at the same time. I'm reminded of Freud's alleged statement that Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. We can coat anything with a veneer of verbal paint without seeing the true color of the underlying timber. This movie is about lust and how it sometimes drives us even though we paint it in technicolor rationalizations. This film gave me an enduring crush on Russell, who married Roeg.

This slowly leads to some very dark aspects of their personalities.  Eventually culminating with a rather startling conclusion.The story and scenes are told in a fragmented style that never completely comes together.  The characters are never really fleshed out or likable.  Yet this is what actually makes the film work.  At no time is Director Roeg impling that he has a answer to what makes these people tick.  After all who really does.  All we can do is explore this destructive relationship and try to make some sense of it.  Which is what Roeg does in a very hypnotic and kinetic way.Although a great singer Garfunkel is very weak in the lead.  He has almost no presence and seems to be 'calling in' his performance. Yet as the film progresses this seems, to an extent, to actually fit.  After all this is a weak character that is controlled and detached not only from Russell, but also himself.Russell, as the seductress, is expectantly alerting.  She seems reminiscent of Lana Turner in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. The screen literally drenches in sexuality every time she's on it.  Even, in a twisted way, when she's in the hospital room.Director Roeg shows a complete awareness of his craft.  Everything from music selection to visual construction.  It's all moody and evocative.

The more I see from this master of cinema techniques, the more impressed I get.Bad Timing makes an awkward sort of Musician Trilogy with Performance and The Man Who Fell to Earth. Each movie is completely different and deals with completely different issues, but each of them star a musician/rock-star in a role that couldn't be done by anyone else. In this case the star is Art Garfunkel, who plays an obsessive psychoanalyst who's powers of understanding the mind help him in no way understand the free-spirited woman he's fallen in love with.Coming 15 years before Pulp Fiction, this movie is edited out of chronology. It's not the first use of this device (some accredit Kubrick's The Killing to creating the approach, but it's honestly appeared throughout cinema history), but it's one that came well before the late 90s when it became popular and, in some cases, clichÃ©. The approach has a completely different use, as well... besides slowly revealing the events leading up to the tragic ending, it also creates a presence in the form of Harvey Keitel's investigator (again?! Is he always to be one in some movie or another?) throughout Alex and Milena's relationship that foreshadows the downward spiral it is going to take.Roeg's previous movies tend to have cuts with very sharp edges to them, and this one is just a bit more reserved. It seems he's learned how to use the zoom he favors so well with the discontinuity editing he's developed to a more subtle and undertoned pace, which is fantastic! I personally prefer the sharper editing of previous features, but to see someone grow as a filmmaker and not be stuck in one particular approach is a good thing. And like all of his movies, Bad Timing is saturated in allusions and symbolism not easily recognizable upon the first viewing. Indeed, half a second after this movie ended, I wanted to watch it again... just like Performance and Walkabout.Another point of interest the dialog during the scene where Milena was drunk and kept asking Alex Is this what you want? What do you want from me? is a bitingly acute representation of interrelationship conflict. It stands with the taxi scene in New York, New York as one of the most blatant and straightforward visualizations of a couple's dysfunction I've ever seen.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"a stimulating movie","Date":"27 September 2002","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  a stimulting movie , because you have what i consider to be an honest perspective on a human relationship . to wit , a beautiful woman , wayward/rebellious ?? , with her own ethos on living her own life , and her own individuality , becoming embroiled in a relationship destined to cause her harm  due to her emancipation/individuality . mixed in with this , we have the cultural (klimt etc) undertones (as evidenced in the interpretation of his pictures and , from an art point of view , colour arrangement )and the psychoanalytical infusions (ie freud etc) - sex as a factor in mental development - ego and id - but why is the protagonist , a supposedly intellectual guy who is fully aware of the psychoanalytical arguments , drawn into the primaeval role ? roeg juxtaposes all these elements , in the manner to which he is renowned , to produce a complex character study with many layers to appreciate . all that , and an opening track from tom waits and    harvey keitel to boot!!

As in all Roeg's films, the editing is brilliant.On the negative side, I'm sure that mine wouldn't be the first review entitled Bad Casting. Art Garfunkle is hopeless in this role. It's not so much his acting, but his appearance and thin whiny voice makes it difficult to believe that a hottie like Theresa Russell would fall for him. Russell's performance, however, is sensational.The third lead, Harvey Keitel, is good as the detective, although the principals' complete disregard for appropriate accents meant that I didn't realise for quite a while that the film is actually set in Vienna.Similarly, I was very surprised to find that the film was made in 1980 &#150; I would have pegged it at about the same time as Performance and Walkabout (i.e. circa 1970).
