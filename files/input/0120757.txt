To call this movie slapdash is an undeserved compliment--it's likely they figured it was a lost cause and that no amount of work would improve it.  That's probably true.  Omar Epps isn't a very good actor to begin with, but here he's even worse than usual, mumbling his lines without a clue as to what is going on in the movie.  Giovanni Rabisi seems to have fun with his role, but playing one imbecile after another, one gets the feeling he may not be so much acting as giving a glimmer as to his real personality.  Claire Danes obviously can act, as she showed in Little Women, but here she's dreadful.  Dennis Farina is good in just about anything, but here he's given absolutely no help by the director or the other actors.The movie quickly devolves into a series of music videos with bad seventies music intermixed with more modern stuff.  And this squad is not very mod--the opening sequence notes that mod means fashionably dressed, and these guys look like they've been shopping by picking up things strewn on the side of an interstate.

The two biggest complaints are lack of adult dialogue and lack of action. Me, I thought it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. They are kids, not adults. That's the way kids talk. As far as action, I found the emotional struggles to be far more compelling than the action scenes (which, do not, BTW, define a good film). One user even commented that there is no way kids could get around by themselves like that. I was a kid living on the streets when I was younger, and what they accomplish in the movie is certainly not the least of what I have personally witnessed on the street.For those who think only kids like this movie, I am 24.

The script jumped from point to point without ever clearly explaining the real direction of   the plot or the characters. Neither I nor the three people with me ranging from 18 to 85, could work out why the three young 'Mod Squad' members were recruited. We had no idea what they'd done to land themselves in hot water to begin with so they could have been murderers (no sympathy there). The action was minimal the highlight being an old car crashing through a metal door. When was that film set?  my eighteen year old daughter asked me. The clever young actor from the Other Sister relied on the most basic of performance tricks such as shouting, to even be noticed. Long lingering shots of the female lead became dull. The young black actor had little to work on in his scripted characterisation. I found myself confused between the good and the bad cops and why a call to the police precinct, which had set up the criminal bust finale , was so obligingly     received and acted on so promptly. The police  were called to the scene as backup for    our hero who was then an  escaped felon (or was he????). The  direction in my opinion     was experimental to the point of distraction. One scene had  our three protagonists in  the front seat of a car plotting their next move. This was the bench mark. We saw the camera pan left, right, right, left, right, left then left again so continuously I became dizzy.

Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch are just two of the more profitable franchises (the latter of the two bringing in $28 million in its first week). But both of those series tend to have fun with what they're parodying, rather than remaking. The Mod Squad is basically just a remake of the show of the same title, minus any real sort of substance and humor, and only a low amount of actual fun. It could have been a blast, but it's just rather mediocre.Three young delinquents (Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps) are recruited by a cop (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate many various operations (prostitute rings, drug circles) that police could never get into. But after their boss is murdered and they uncover a conspiracy, the three delinquents take it upon themselves to find out the truth behind the crime.2.5/5 stars.- John UlmerThe plot is pretty weak, even for a 60s TV show remake. The Mod Squad ran from 1968 - 1973, with somewhere in the vicinity of 120 episodes. I never saw any, but I can't imagine this film adaptation does the show much justice.The cast is considerably OK. Danes is quite enthusiastic and pretty enough for her sweet-blonde role, Ribisi is fine as a criminal and Epps is decent enough, too. Farina (Get Shorty, Another Stakeout) is a good actor, always very funny, but here his role is completely wasted (literally!) and short on the sort of sly humor that would have been appropriate given the actor behind it. The dialogue is really corny, and so are the characters' actions. Television shows need not worry about smart dialogue or characters, because they're usually 30 minutes long (sometimes an hour), and we just get hooked on what's going on. Can you imagine if a soap opera made its way onto the big screen? It'd completely flop. People watch television shows because they like to see continuous stories with recurring characters they learn to love over a certain time period.You can't get any joy out of watching a bunch of actors try to grow on you for 90 minutes. If Alias had ever started out as a big-screen movie, it might have flopped, because let's face it the show is not exactly quality material. People watch it because they get hooked on it, and they enjoy watching the stories and the revelations, like an old woman addicted to her General Hospital episodes.So here's proof that if The Mod Squad had originally been a movie, there probably would have been no television show. Despite some rather bad word-of-mouth, this movie isn't a terrible one. I've seen much worse, and compared to big-screen disasters like Freddy Got Fingered, or low-budget ones like The Blade Master, this is nothing very laughable at all.But compared to the fun factor of Charlie's Angels or Starsky and Hutch, The Mod Squad falls flat on its face. It's not very funny, it's not very fun, and it's not very original. It's a cash-in, which is something Hollywood is not in short supply of right now. If you miss The Mod Squad, you're not missing anything that hasn't been done before.

At least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking. This is just tedious. Claire Danes is nice to look at, but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around spying on the baddies. Giovanni Ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that Droopy the Dog look for an hour and forty five minutes. And Omar Epps looks like he wants to flee the set, but the script's chlostraphobia has trapped him. Sure, the production is nice, with the now seemingly obligitory rave nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore. Oh, and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too. It's kind of like deciding to use the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to go on a family vacation to Hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs.

The story lines frequently dealt with then-timely topics of the counter culture, feminism, civil rights, racism, the war in Vietnam, the (Baby Boomer era) generation gap, and more. Without actually being cops, this was a precursor of sorts to the 1980s-era 21 Jump Street.This film takes the basic, general concept of the Mod Squad, but doesn't execute the story very well. The lead characters (played by Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi, Claire Daines) all come across as sullen twits who have had previous scrapes with the law as teens, but somehow have come under the mentorship of a police Captain (played by a wasted Dennis Farina.) **Major Spoilers** the death of the Captain early on in the story prompts a revenge investigation by the Squad, but his death puts a cap on finding out just why this guy was so committed to mentoring these delinquents instead of just allowing the book to be thrown at them, years ago.The main plot has the team investigating a drug ring that heavily uses young adults as mules/dealers. Of course, the main boss is anything but someone their age, hence the don't trust anyone over 25 attitude among the trio.Julie (Danes) has a cheating boyfriend, and in one sequence she sets his car and clothes on fire in revenge. This comes only a few years removed from a similar tactic seen in Waiting to Exhale, so there's a bit of anticlimactic context to it.The villain is a generic mobster, and a sequence where he wants to dance with one of the male Squad guys is played straight, but comes across as an awkward gay-panic joke.The theater audience I saw this with got more of a hoot out of Eddie Griffin's cameo than they did out of Omar Epps' entire performance.About the only role I envied in this film was Claire Danes' pants.

The relative cool (at the time) of the original TV series--which cast ostensible hippies as offenders-turned-undercover-cops--is hard to reproduce, as since then we've had 21 Jump Street and so forth.

Actually the brief dramatic aspects here--Ribisi's disillusionment with his parents, Danes with her lying beau-- are decently handled.

So there's a slow motion scene where the mod squad walk around a corner and if I were filming a Zima commercial it would be perfect. And also, Ribisi wears these pretty fly sunglasses throughout the film that I hope he got to keep because I'll be surprised if he ever finds a job again.I confess, I've never seen an episode of the original The Mod Squad, but if the series was even one nanosecond as pitiful as this pathetic update, then I'm amazed that it lasted five seasons. This Mod Squad stars, in no particular stellar order, Claire Danes as Julie, and runaway convicted of assault, Giovianni Ribisi as Pete, a thief, and Omar Epps as Lincoln, a convicted arsonist. The trio is ubercool juvenile delinquents who get a second chance to rise above their lives of crime from Police Captain Dennis Farina by posing as undercover (unarmed) cops who can infiltrate the Los Angeles underground. Fortunately for us, the movie starts with a dictionary definition of both mod (modern, duh. You know, hip and cool, in a way that you and I will never be,) and squad (apparently this means some kind of group of people collected to accomplish a specific purpose, or something.) It was at this point the acidic lump of regret began to form inside of me. A few seconds late, we are blown away by a nightclub raid where our heroes are introduced as reckless party goers who get busted. It was the first of too many unnecessary, unexplained scenes. If there were a storyline that was at all suspenseful or entertaining, I would surely hint at it for you at this time, but, alas, as a wise man once said, It is hard to make chicken soup out of chicken s**t.Here goes anyway The squad figures out that all the cop stereotypes are true, including the one where a few are on a serious take and will stop at nothing, including killing fellow cops, to keep their graft a secret. Of course, the squad can't depend on the dirty cops for help, so with a little ingenuity (and I emphasize LITTLE) they form a plan to blow the gig wide open. All the while, there a few too many repetitive gags involving a vintage green Lincoln. Ribisi says bro way too many times. Danes says right on too many times. The director shows us the some scenes twice from differing angles in an attempt to give the film some edginess. Oh god.Now, I realize that the real purpose of this movie was to get Claire Danes' face back in front of us-she didn't want us to forget about her while she was off diligently pursuing her degree at Harvard. (Maybe she saw what happened to Kimberly Williams when SHE went off to college.) And we get to see her face plenty. Her butt, too. She wears some sort of heroin-chic like makeup (hello, last year?!?!) and really low slung pants that are way too cool for either you or me to even try to wear.The soundtrack was a decent distraction, which featured Lauryn Hill, occasionally-a nice break from the visual stupidity. Mostly, this film was disappointing not because I expected a fabulous thrill ride-I didn't even see any trailers for this one, but because I've seen Danes and Ribisi perform well in other movies and Epps exhibited real talent as Dr. Grant on ER. I expected more from them (always a mistake, I know..) It didn't even seem as though they were attempting to rise above a bad script. They could have at least made it so bad that it was a little bit funny-and not by taking pot shots at Hanson.

Given their less than stellar backgrounds, and because of who they are and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go places other cops can't, so they are tapped by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring.  For a start, Julie gets a job there as a waitress, while Pete and Linc just `hang out' to find out what they may.  Julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old boyfriend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who turns out to be involved with drugs, which are tied in to the shady dealings going down at the bar.  Before it's over, the `squad' is in it up to their necks, while also running afoul of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs, and consequently tied in with their investigation. 	 	From the beginning of the movie, there is a sense that you are coming in late; as if it's presupposed that you know what's going on as far as the origin and workings of the squad.  All you get here are brief mug-shot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past; there's nothing about how this all actually came about.  The thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story quicker, get things moving along.  While this is true to a certain extent, some added background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting; the way it was done here merely depreciates the credibility of the entire proceedings.  The plot is marginal to begin with, and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while.  What's delivered, and quite unimaginatively at that, is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters.  The performances are satisfactory, but the actors get no help from the script, nor apparently from Silver; Danes, Ribisi and Epps come close to fleshing out Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time allotted them, combined with the lack of support, they still fall way short of giving these people life.  Farina, a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here, comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the `good cop.'  There's a feeling that everything was given the once-over in this film; some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one.   	The supporting cast includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky).  It's a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this; a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie.  As it is, it comes across as ill-conceived and poorly executed.  Danes, Ribisi and Epps are like Major Leaguers who got stuck playing for all the marbles at the local sandlot; instead of getting a shot at the title, they all got hung out to dry.  Like Terry says in `On The Waterfront,' `You was my brother, Charlie, you shoulda been looking out for me.'  Well, it's obvious that there was no Charlie to look out for them here, and after `The Mod Squad,' they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time.

I now realize that this 1999 action thriller is based on a TV show of the same name which was in production from the late '60s to the early '70s. I've never seen any episodes of that show, but have now seen this movie. Previously, I had only seen Danes in Brokedown Palace, a film which came out the same year as this Mod Squad film adaptation, and wasn't impressed with her performance in that film. Judging by this film's reputation, which I knew nothing about until after I decided to rent it and before I watched it, it didn't look like it was any good, and now that I've seen it, I don't think it's as bad as many do, but certainly don't think it's good either.Julie, Peter, and Lincoln are three juvenile delinquents who have all received prison sentences, but they have a choice. The can either serve their jail times or take Captain Adam Greer's offer to work as undercover cops. All three of them take the police captain's offer and soon begin their undercover assignments, using their criminal experience to try and catch other criminals in the act. However, they haven't had this job for long by the time the three of them discover that Greer has been murdered, and as convicted felons who have recently been working with the police captain, they're bound to be the main suspects! Detective Mothershed tells them he is letting them off this one because this is what Greer would have wanted, so Julie, Peter, and Lincoln then go on a mission to find out who really killed the police captain, and are in for some unpleasant surprises on this complicated mission! As I said, I was not impressed with Claire Danes' performance in Brokedown Palace. For that reason, it wasn't very surprising when I found her performance in the role of Julie in this film to be pretty poor, which is one of the film's major problems. Pete, another lead character, is played by Giovanni Ribisi, and this is another unimpressive performance. Also, it seems this character is often supposed to be funny, but if that's the case, he's not. Of the three leads, Omar Epps' performance as Linc is the only one I can't really complain about, though his performance certainly isn't good enough to make up for the other two. In addition to the cast problems, this movie also seems a bit rushed at the beginning, not giving the three main characters a good enough introduction. There were parts of the film I found somewhat gripping, but whenever that happened, it didn't last. For the most part, I was bored, even with all the action and such, and a major reason for this might have been that I didn't like the characters.It appears this is another lacklustre movie based on a TV show from decades earlier, just like the film versions of The Flintstones, Lost in Space, Wild Wild West, and Land of the Lost. I've seen all five of these adaptations/remakes. All of them have basically left me cold, and this particular one hasn't convinced me that Claire Danes is a good actress. Apart from The Flintstones, I haven't seen episodes of any of these shows, but realize that the movies are no indication of the shows' quality. I think I can assume all these shows are superior to the films which are based on them. So, just like the others I've just mentioned, I think I can say regarding this particular film that whether you're a fan of the TV show or not (if you've seen it), this silver screen adaptation is probably not worth watching. If you're not familiar with that show, like me, then I still don't recommend this 1999 movie version.

I have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they're pretty light duty, so I didn't expect much from the movie. That's a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash. I admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit. The movie audience, though, has gained sophistication in 30 years. At least, I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, on the big screen. In the 1960s, we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. It was that, another thrilling episode of Ironsides or Password.Rating this episode against usual theatre releases, the story was...well, I'm not sure I should even say because I'm not sure there was one. Drugs are bad? Whatever. The script was silly. When the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like I overheard him say so on the phone, and I think I got a plan, we really are in trouble. No wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic lines.If I were Claire Danes, I'd be going after my agent with a flame-thrower right now. (Actually, I think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution.)And where was the Mod in that Squad? I realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall, but no one had a velvet suit? Mod only meant young and integrated? What happened to white go-go boots? Perhaps the costume department was going for gritty, but all they got was dirty and dingy.Since the movie was completely true to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I still don't like it. If I wanted to watch 60's crime drama, I'd buy DVDs. No thanks.

The 'place' turns out to be a 'club', one of the toughest places to get into, maybe it was student night?

While Omar Epps is cool and in charge as Linc and Giovanni Ribisi is quirky and comedic as Pete, Claire Danes plays a pretty plain Julie. Unfortunately, the characters' histories are glazed over and the film is negligent in their absence, such as how Julie knows the older man from her past that she is seeing. Furthermore, Linc seems pretty level-headed for a former arsonist with a message. While a wonderful scene with Pete encountering his parents was touching, the audience is left to wonder what came before.The premise of this movie is a bit limited, as the authority the kids don't have but pretend to stretches credibility. Three young convicts working off their time through undercover assignments for the police can only do so much, and it's not plausible that many would respect their commands as one individual does in this film. Even if one can suspend disbelief, the story is predictable, sometimes incomprehensible and has a few holes.There are some bright spots in this film besides the style and characters, such as how alone the characters realize they are in solving the case.

Three young, hot actors. Cool trailers. All of my friends were talking about it (although this could tell you what kind of friends I have). Then I went and saw it. What a huge disappointment.Omar Epps is Link, Claire Danes is Julie, and Giovanni Ribisi is Pete. All three of them are criminals (Link-Arson, Julie-Assault, Pete-Robbery), and for some reason these three are chosen by L.A. Police Captain Greer (Dennis Farina) to become cops because they can get into places normal police officers can't. It's never explained how these three got chosen. In fact the movie starts and they're already cops and we're in the middle of some police corruption case involving stolen cocaine. When Captain Greer dies and the Mod Squad is taken out of rotation, they decide to find out who killed their leader and why. Throw in a foot chase, Claire Danes in her underwear, a car bomb and a violent battle scene at the end, and you have the movie.First of all, none of the characters besides Link held my interest. I found it very hard to believe Danes as a street tough girl. Her dialogue was horrible, and even as talented as actress as she is, she couldn't save it. Besides one quick scene in the beginning there wasn't anything about her that suggested she was tough. She let herself get walked all over by some guy who seemed to have known her from her past but once again that's not really explained. Ribisi seems to play the same character in most of his films. A stuttering, sometimes violent guy who's just misunderstood and always has a heart. Epps was the only one who played his character cool and collected. Again however, there was nothing in his character, or Ribisi's for that matter, that suggested why they were criminals to begin with, or why they would be chosen to become cops. The dialogue for the movie was horrible. It was very forced and cheesy. No wait; if it was cheesy it might have been entertaining. The story line wasn't explained at all until the very end. Why these cops did what they did isn't known. How it all started, nothing like that was ever explained. We're just tossed into the middle and expected to figure it all out. There was no background or motivation for any of the characters. There was nothing. If it weren't for Omar Epps this film would have been a complete waste.I was so looking forward to The Mod Squad, and yet again I was disappointed.

I don't know if it's character development, or flow, or, how about a plot?  The failure of this film actually is a combination of all of these things.  The Mod Squad manages to rip off several cliches to form its undercover-can't even trust the cops plotline.  The problem is that the cliches that are ripped off aren't interesting in the first place.  There's even a point when I believe the film makers figured out how pedestrian the film was, panicked, and threw in a self-mocking comment about how cliche it was to have the final confrontation in an abandoned warehouse.  Ribisi even has the line which says in so many words, This is one of those bad cop drug things.  Yes, it is, and the French Connection or even Fletch it's not.I must say that it is hard to blame the actors for this mess (even though I question their role selection).  Danes looks good but her character is uninspired.  Epps looks like he's asleep through the whole picture (he's probably as bored as we are).  The talented Ribisi at least tries to overcome the bland script, but ultimately becomes guilty of mugging for the camera rather than acting.The final word on the Mod Squad is that it probably wouldn't and couldn't be made without an association with a television series that, as far as I know, only a handful of people watched.

I can't complain I received fair warning when there was still plenty of time to run for the exit, as I probably should have done when I went on my first date with my ex-girlfriend.But I digress. Or maybe not. The Mod Squad is a bizarre film that, like your relationship with your ex-girlfriend, leaves you wondering just what you were thinking when you decided to waste part of your life on it. I was lured to this film by a misleadingly interesting trailer, which bears no resemblance to the actual (lousy) flick in question.A few questions for MGM Was there an actual screenplay here, or did the actors just make up things as they went along? Couldn't you have been the least bit creative and replaced the same old movie villains (smarmy drug dealers and suave pimps) with believably dangerous characters (like feminists and Democrats)? Did you actually think that one glimpse of Claire Danes in a black bodysuit was enough to make up for rotten acting, confusing plotline and ridiculous premise? (All right, maybe it was.) And finally, how could a company with GM in its name make such a lousy product?

I certainly can't defend it as a good movie, but it's more venturesome than the other teen-pandering quickies that have mushroomed in the wake of SCREAM. The congested and inscrutable plotting suggests multiple sets of producer notes, and the 93-minute running time lays bare one studio agenda Make it move fast and dump it. But for all that, this photo essay on three damaged rebels (Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps) turned rogue cops has one ambition to reproduce the look and feeling of a now-faded BARETTA or STARSKY AND HUTCH episode. I didn't say it was a great ambition, but at least the filmmakers have one. The cinematographer, Ellen Kuras, manages to create an ambience of recently excavated 1973 even in unlighted outdoor daytime shots, and the composer, BC Smith, works the seventies-cop-show catalogue as slyly as Tarantino mined blaxploitation music cues in JACKIE BROWN.The sensitive-post-teen trio are mostly repellent (as characters, not as actors) and the movie doesn't make a lick of sense--you find yourself asking, after some patently absurd plot turn, Is this a homage to CHARLIE'S ANGELS storytelling? But the director, Scott Silver, deserves credit for trying, at least, to keep it real--even if only audiovisually. It seems baldly clear that a voice at MGM said, We want it to have an edge--but not TOO much of an edge. The result is this woozily vacillating compromise of a movie--not quite nineties teen pablum, not quite seventies grit. But one has gratitude to the filmmakers under the circumstances--just for giving it a shot. "},{"Title":"No gun. No badge.

He sees the potential in using their skills to fight crime rather than being part of it.  When Greer is murdered, the three are cut loose but decide to investigate the killing themselves.  As they begin to dig they find a much more complicated conspiracy that they could have imagined, involving criminals as well as dirty cops.I don't even think that this film managed to even get a cinema release in the UK, so bad was the box office for it in the US.  If it was released then I totally missed it - although I really don't think I would have bothered with it even if it had played on the biggest screens in the biggest cinemas. Summers recently have had more than their fair share of TV remakes and retro shows - Charlie's Angels and Starsky & Hutch to name two as examples. What made this one flop was that Mod Squad as a film lacks fun, spark, invention and wit.  The plot is clichéd - to the point that even the characters start to make jokes about how clichéd it all seems (`I feel one of us should be saying we are too old for this sh*t' one says at one point). However, the plot isn't the problem - look at Charlie's Angels, it has zero plot yet it made enough money to made a sequel!It is the lack of fun etc that exposes the plot to scrutiny that it can't stand up to.  I was surprised by just how uninspired the whole thing was it had a cool cast, cool music and the potential for tongue in cheek snappy action.  However everything it did really just came across as ordinary - certainly `fun' is not a word I would use to describe it, maybe `passable' would be more appropriate.  The music is cool and the direction is slick but sadly this doesn't make it come across as swish and stylish - more superficial.The cool cast offer promise but only deliver disappointment.  Danes is sexy and that is all she is used for, posing in panties and that's about it. Ribisi is a good actor and seems to enjoy himself here, but he isn't as much fun to watch as he thinks and he can't carry the can himself.  Epps is a good looking guy and I like his films, but I am not so blind to know a bad performance when I see it.  Seemingly at a loss as to what the film is meant to do, he mumbles his way through with an instantly forgettable performance. The support cast is quite good on paper but can't lift this film - Farina, Brolin and a few others all add recognisable faces but that's about it.Overall this is not as awful as people say I think some reviewers here have been influenced by the witch hunt launched by some professional critics - everyone needs something to hate and occasionally this turns a poor movie into `the worst movie ever!' (see also Gigli).  However, this film is weak no matter how kind you are.  It's plot is lame, it's script full of clunky dialogue and the product uninspiring and dull.  The cast, music and direction are all cool superficially but it still a weak film that feels like the makers just assumed that a film remake of a 70's tv show would just make money by itself - they were wrong.

I can, however, tell you the this is one movie that contains a whole lot of nothing.The movie stars Claire Danes as Julie, as an addict at age 18, Giovanni Ribisi as Pete, who when directly to Beverly Hills to the County Jail, and Omar Epps, who has no heart or compassion, leading him to a life in prison. The teens are called the Mob Squad, because Capt. Greer (Dennis Farina) has taken them from their lives at crime and supposedly turned them around, now doing serious undercover police work for him.The plot, what little there is, has to do with the young trio fulfilling an assignment penetrate a club where prostitution and drug-dealing are seemingly accruing. The only problem, the team can't officially carry guns, badges, and the movie never tells us if they can aren't allowed to arrest anyone.The film offers a few shocking surprises in the story line, consisting of a few corrupt cops who we thought were good guys. The villains are somewhat of a mystery  until the middle of the movie, and the ever popular concept of trust no one is used with some curiosity. This whole movie is kind of like the very recent The Corrupter, which was a whole lot worse than this. That was mindless violence. At least this film was mindless action. (See The Corrupter review. You'll understand what I mean by mindless violence compared to mindless action.)The Mob Squad is shot in supreme style and glamour. The characters act like top class superheros, the cinematography is used with a dazzling array of lights and background effects, and the movie is directed with a focused point of view. My objection all of the action sequences never build up any momentum for themselves. The plot contains purpose for violence, but it is worked into the movie, almost as if the film was shot with no action, the re-edited for the addition of excitement.Likable characters inherit the credits.  Claire Danes (U-Turn, Romeo + Juliet) is kind of fun to watch as she and her buddies get further and further into deep trouble. Giovanni Ribisi (Friends) provides UN-funny comic relief, which really doesn't fit in, but is still enjoyable. Josh Brolin (Nightwatch) puts a sense of sneakiness and wit into his unpredictable character.The movie has such little plot, though. I had extremely low expectations of the film when I went to see it, and it was much better than I thought it would be. I suppose that I might give this film a marginal recommendation to a certain extent if you liked the television program, or asinine combat, the movie just might be to you liking.Director Scott Silver definitely knows his stuff here. He co-wrote the movie as well, and has lots of fun with different elements in his production. Too bad for the brainlessness of the plot. You see, I have a very hard time giving a movie thumbs up when three characters are the main situation in every part of a story, and when the film ended I didn't feel that I knew them any better than I did when I saw them on the screen for the very first time.  "},{"Title":"Out of Fashion","Date":"18 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Spoilers herein.Ribisi is rather interesting. In cases like this where neither the writer or the director know what they are doing, it gives the actors a chance to fill in the holes and make their part of the movie the way they want. So because this is a mess, and because it has some young actors that could be talented, its worth watching to see what they do behind the adult's backs.Ribisi has great control. Reminds me of Young Leo in `Gilbert Grape,' back when he was a good actor. I haven't seen all his work, just `Thing you Do,' `Private Ryan,' `Suicides (voice),' `60 Seconds,' and `Gift.' That last one made me sit up and take notice. He clearly likes to show off, and since he's cut some slack here, he pulls some acting tricks sometimes he does the `I'm watching with you' trick. Sometimes the `I'm watching you while moving' trick. Sometimes he dives in and spins up a controlled nervous energy just for fun, to steal the moment.This doesn't yet make for great acting. But he seems there, committed and aware, and poor Epps is so outclassed. Epps thinks it is enough to act cool street black, which is an act in itself.I'm a little confused about Ms Danes. She's pretty. She's at least adequate for this sort of thing if played straight.  Though not shouted, her character is a hooker, druggie, street person. Her old boyfriend is a pimp and user. One would have guessed she'd show off too. Instead, she seems to have chosen not to play the character, but to play a bad TeeVee actress playing a less realistic character, in concert with similar decisions in the cinematography and score. That's why they put her in those goofy (really unflattering) pants which in themselves set the stage for the three levels.But she doesn't deliver on this opportunity. It's too many layers for her to manage at once. How could this be? She was a perfect Juliet in that multileveled production. But on reflection, all the extra dimensions in R+J came from other elements of the process than the acting, in particular the editing, framing and scoring. The director would have wanted straight, but competent actors. And that's how she was cast here, only the directing and all falls flat.So what we have in Claire I think is a young Michelle Pfeiffer, someone not very committed or intelligent, but who can competently and pleasantly deliver the straight goods for a couple decades.
