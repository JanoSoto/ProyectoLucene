My Sister recommended it to me, and I passed it off. Coming across half of it on t.v. one night, this corrected my qualms about this movie quick, as I eventually did hire it on video in 94. The movie is a cheap laugh riot, steered by the great comic timing, and priceless expressions from Pryor, who after a couple of weeks of being jobless, he's just been thrown a work offer he can't refuse that involves moving.... again. His whole family, especially his daughter, driven to desperate and funny measures, are dead set against it. Finally forced to make the big trip, his hell has only begun. He has the removalists from hell, that includes King Kong Bundy, so you don't want to hypothesize on breakages and damages to valuables, etc. His driveaway guy has personality disorders, and the last tenants of their new home in Boise, were whack jobs, while also his new neighbor, is the arsehole brother of an equally irritating guy, who shared former neighborhood residence with Pryor. What are the chances? Moving is cheap side splitting and quite inventive laughter, while also taking quips at all the downfalls and hassles of moving, where behind the quips are realistic clouds of what's involved in making the big move, and the stuff ups that can happen, where they've just all been peppered with comedy or inanity. The catalyst is very real, when you approach it from Pryor's point of view. The rebellious daughter who stymies their chances to sell their old home, was real, where as I said before, she's much opposed to moving, and kind of brought shades of my rebellious in the home. The frequently funny film, also brings Rambo into the picture. This is a great vehicle for Pryor, and though not everyone will see this film my way, and I'm talking Pryor, here's one not to overlook, but just see. We also see that being black twin brothers does have it's advantages on the running field, and in the classroom. The movie does have some sharp humor too, where as I said laughs are continual, where identity changing Carvey is a hoot.

From hiring a deranged man to drive his Saab to Boise, to criminal moving men, to buying a house in Boise from a crazy old man, it seems Arlo's mental state is being tested to see if it will break.Moving seemingly would work great as a family film as it has that Cosby Show feel to it but for some strange reason they chose to make it an R- rated film and stunt its box office potential.Regardless, Pryor is in good form here and seeing him react to his worsening luck over and over again is fun stuff. Randy Quaid also shines as his neighbor and deranged ex-Vietnam vet Frank Crawford, who childishly abuses Arlo. There are some cool small roles from the likes of Rodney Dangerfield and pro wrestler King Kong Bundy, as well.Not the best Richard Pryor comedy out there but a good one and a lot better than the critics at the time opined.

He works as a transportation engineer and just this morning he got laid off, so now he's out of a job, and as if that wasn't bad enough, he's hounded constantly by his whacko neighbor Frank Crawford who mows his lawn with a huge lawn tractor. One day, Arlo receives a decent job offer from TGI, a transit company. The job sounded great, except it was in Boise, Idaho. Arlo broke the news of the move to the family and it devastated them, especially teenage daughter Casey who had her life in New Jersey. She pulled some pranks on people coming to look at the house, but soon a couple decided they liked the house and bought it. Next, Arlo hired some movers Edwards and Perry, former conmen. So the Pears get a different moving company. Arlo hires picture-perfect Brad Williams to drive his SAAB to Boise; Soon the movers (Edwards and Perry who changed jobs) arrive with their monstrous assistant, Gorgo. They load the Pears' stuff into the truck, while intentionally breaking a few things and head off. Brad drives off in the SAAB and soon the Pears leave New Jersey, as well as Casey who wouldn't come so she stayed with friends.         On the way, Arlo learns that Brad Williams is a man with multiple personalities and as if that wasn't bad enough, when they arrive at their new house they find it half empty. It was missing it's stairs, kitchen, doors and pool. Apparently the previous owners weren't joking when they said they were taking them with them. To add insult to injury, the movers took a wrong turn to New Orleans, Louisiana for Mardi Gras. But things were looking up when Arlo goes to his new job, which ends even before it begins. Things keep getting worse when Arlo meets his new neighbor Cornell Crawford, Frank's twin who also uses a large lawn tractor to cut his grass. Luckily, Arlo caught up with the movers and engaged in a showdown. He took down Gorgo, Edwards and Perry and they placed the Pears' stuff into their house. Arlo also makes peace with Cornell. What's more, Arlo suggests a new movement to Gary Marcus, head of Arlo's new firm and he liked them, so Arlo got his job back. Everything was okay from then on. Casey even came home!        This was a good movie. I'm a Richard Pryor fan. I liked him in Silver Streak, The Toy, See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and Stir Crazy. This movie is funny. The supporting cast includes Randy Quaid as Frank and Cornell Crawford, Dana Carvey as Brad Williams, Beverly Todd as Monica Pear, Stacey Dash as Casey. If you've moved to different houses throughout your life or you never moved at all, you'll enjoy this movie. I recommend Moving!!

In this movie we have a man who is laid off and is offered a very nice job in Boise. Of course, his daughter is rather upset about the prospect of going there, however his wife and twin sons are a bit more supportive. Also happy to see the family go is the crazy neighbor played rather good by Randy Quaid. A neighbor who for some reason must cut his rather small lawn with an industrial mower. Well he has a couple of moving agencies give their appraisal of what it would take to move and he goes with the more expensive as the cheap ones look like recently escaped convicts or something. They find a nice house in Boise where they meet the delightful owners who tell great jokes about how they are going to take everything from the doors to the pool with them. Then he finds just the perfect guy to drive one of his vehicles to the new house. Well everything begins to unravel rather quickly as the movers turn out to be familiar faces he does not want to see, the jokes on them with the new house, and the driver of the car has a bit of a mental problem. So all in all a funny movie, a few of the jokes miss the marks such as the giving the wrong finger thing, however most are pretty good like how the twin sons run track. So for a rather light Richard Pryor comedy that still has some good laughs, give this movie a try.

It just doesn't fit. The film's writers and producers obviously couldn't make their minds up about what direction they were going to take this in. Family comedy, Pryor vehicle or kick ass suburban nightmare send-off? In they end they tried to attach all three and not surprisingly the result is a poorly paced and confused affair lacking coherence and overall good direction.'The Burbs' was intelligent because it kind of put you in a safe and familiar environment then turned it on it's head. It also had some really well developed characters. But there is little at best of that here. Randy Quaid's character is supposed to be the neighbour from hell. At least that is what we're told and what is instigated through Pryor's reaction to him. But we don't actually see much evidence of this. Which kind of made me not really understand why Pryor hated him so much. Shame as well because this is the kind of role that big Randy usually kicks ass in ie. - 'National Lampoons Vacations I,II and IV' and 'Next Door'. The removals guys were just really predictable (with the King Kong Bundy joke not really working nowadays) and though he usually makes me laugh the Dana Carvey section just wasn't well.......funny.The side stories about Pryor's daughter staying behind in Jersey because of her new boyfriend also just falls apart. He doesn't answer a call from her the night after her folks leave so from that we are meant to infer I think that he is cheating or something so she just ups sticks and moves out after her folks. Okay. But what the hell does this contribute to the story? Similarly Pryor's two twin sons decide to pass themselves off as one person throughout the movie. Ah the old identical twin joke. So their parents never went to a parent's night obviously as they claim that nobody ,outside the family home, has ever clocked onto it in their 12 years of existence. And this plot device is used for? Well nothing. Just another inconsequential little side story with no resolution. The whole bit involving Pryor becoming a Post-Apocalyptic like, Kung-Fu using warrior out of frustration is more embarrassing than entertaining sadly. This films just left me feeling disappointed as there were certainly the tools and potential for something more. As it is it's more of a kind of mild and forgetful rainy Saturday afternoon type of experience. Check out 'Neighbours'and 'Funny Farm' if your looking for something in the same territory which hits the mark more often. See 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' or 'The Burbs' if your looking something along the same lines but which is completely superior.

Ranging from awful (SUPERMAN III) to merely mediocre (CRITICAL CONDITION), his Reagan-Bush output didn't produce anything decent until he reteamed with Gene Wilder for 1989's SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL (which, granted, was no classic). MOVING wasn't his worst movie, but it certainly didn't help his career. Playing a meek suburbanite, Pryor's raw comedic persona was castrated with a silly name (Arlo Pear???) and a bland, inoffensive script. Watch him in this movie and note how defeated he appears. In a decade Pryor went from STIR CRAZY and BLUE COLLAR to a feature-length sitcom that could have starred anybody.That's not to say MOVING is without merits. It provided Dana Carvey with his funniest role that didn't co-star Mike Myers, and Randy Quaid (a good actor who can do comedy as opposed to a good comedian) earns a lot of laughs here in a dual role. But the efforts of the supporting cast are wasted by a script that should have gone through more re-writes. A comedy about moving your family across the country could find a lot of humor in the small but countless frustrations that can happen when undertaking such a challenge. Instead of wringing laughs from human foibles, here we've got stupid professional movers who do things to be funny, therefore making what they do unfunny. That old guy wrapping every toy separately? The other guys breaking furniture and taking a side trip to New Orleans? It's dumb, and not believable, and not funny. (However, Carvey acts like he's in a whole 'nother--and better--comedy. I gotta admit his shtick in drag was hilarious.)The movie has structural problems too. It spends half the movie packing their things and dealing with the slob neighbor, and -- bam! -- it jumps to the family's new home. What happened during the 3000-mile drive to get there? Did the kids get on the parent's nerves while cooped up in the back seat the whole time? Surely there are possible cross-country mishaps that weren't already explored in NAT'L LAMPOON'S VACATION, right? (One minor thing. What road did they take out of Jersey? They're on some blacktop with a sign stating they're leaving the Garden State. Um, don't they have to cross the Delaware River to enter Pennsylvania?)And I wonder if a black family from Jersey would assimilate so easily in suburban Idaho. Since anybody could have been cast in the role, was this movie written with Pryor in mind? Doesn't seem so, since this family is white in every way except skin color. Their closest friends are an elderly white couple, and their daughter, played by Stacey Dash, appears to have blue eyes (leading me to believe she should have been cast instead as a Wannabe in Spike Lee's SCHOOL DAZE). Forgive me for raising racial issues in a lightweight '80s comedy, but wouldn't this affluent black family from the East Coast have any reservations about relocating to Aryan Nation? A 1990 census shows that Idaho was over 94% Caucasian while Blacks made up less than one percent around the time the movie was made. (American Indians, at 1.3%, were more represented.) Wouldn't this have been a factor in their decision to move there? Finally, for a movie that's barely ninety minutes long, MOVING coughs and wheezes to the closing credits. It somehow feels both overlong and too short, if that makes sense. And there's a chase scene to wrap things up. A chase scene to end a bad comedy? What else is new?
