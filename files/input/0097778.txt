[{"Title":"Charming","Date":"4 February 2004","Score":"21 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" Look Who's Talking is such a great classic, one of my great memories of childhood, every weekend when I would go to my grandparent's place, they would let me pick a movie and we would watch it together, very often I would pick Look Who's Talking or Look Who's Talking Too, they were just such fun movies to watch and laugh at. When I grew up, I realized I hadn't seen the movie in so many years, but it was on TV the other day and I figured I would have a little blast from the past and watch it. You know what's strange about this movie? It's actually more for adults rather than the kids, but this became such a family friendly movie, but that's why many people say they don't make them like they used too, because writing where it is more aimed at the adults but it ends up being something that every age can enjoy is clever and this is one of the most fun movies of the 90's.Mollie Jensen is an accountant living and working in New York City. The latest client she has been assigned by her firm is a charmingly-handsome but shallow womanizing executive named Albert who seduces her and although married embarks on an affair with Mollie, promising to leave his wife for her. Mollie becomes pregnant with his child. After realizing she is pregnant she informs Albert who takes the news well and again promises to leave his wife and raise the baby with her. Mollie continues her relationship with Albert as the pregnancy develops, however he's seeing another woman. Later when Mollie and her best friend Rona are shopping Mollie finds Albert in a clinch with the other woman. Angry and upset, a heart-broken Mollie storms off in a rage while the fight causes her to suddenly go into labor. When she hails a cab the driver James Ubriacco realizes the seriousness of the situation and speeds off to the hospital. Upon reaching the hospital, the nurses' confuse him for being the father of Mollie's baby and he feels inclined to stay. Mollie gives birth to a son she names Michael. A few days after Mikey is brought home, Mollie receives a visit from James, where he returns the purse she left behind in his taxi. James meets Mikey, and they seem to enjoy each others company. Mollie starts dating again, but quickly realizes that none of the men she has been seeing are good enough for Mikey and one night she lets her guard down and almost sleeps with James; however after imagining what life would be like if she married him, she asks him to leave, despite James telling her he loves both her and Mikey.Look Who's Talking is a charming movie that I'm sure won't disappoint you, it's cute, romantic, funny, and has a great cast. It's a realistic look at what happens with unplanned pregnancy and John Travolta's character, James, becomes the ultimate and unexpected hero of the movie. I hope that I meet a guy like James one day, he was just so lovable. I also adored Bruce Willis' voice, he was a perfect fit for Mikey. Kristy Alley, she plays the crazy mother, but you see all that her character goes through and you just feel awful for her. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend it if you get the chance to see it, it's a great classic.7/10 "},{"Title":"A film that never gets old","Date":"13 April 2005","Score":"21 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" This film has always been a family favourite in our household, and being one when it was first released, I ended up growing up on this film, and I can safely say, 16 years later, I still love it.I don't know anyone who can say that the children that played Mikey were not adorable, because they were seriously the cutest kids ever.

And the movie itself is also quite good. Although it has the neccessary light touch, it's also rather adulty. Films of this calibre wouldn't usually have quite so much innuendo and sex-talk in them. This doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie, but it certainly is surprising.There's a good cast to back this up. Kirstie Alley is ideal as the sexy single mother. John Travolta repeats his character in Saturday Night Fever to a certain degree, which isn't a bad thing. Bruce Willis steals the show as the voice of the baby though.

But for me it was George Segal who stole the show for me, playing Mikey's real father, who in his words is going through a 'selfish phase'.Sadly the sequels are simply terrible, but this movie is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, and I gave it 8/10.

The only thing that can save a movie from being lost in the existing hash is a gimmick that makes it unique. Fortunately, Look Who's Talking gives a fresh perspective on an otherwise trite situation by demonstrating it from the baby's point of view.  Even this could become annoying were it not for the fact that, rather than having a child actor flesh out the character, the clever, snappy dialogue is delivered by Bruce Willis in his most likeable role since Moonlighting. Had they used a child's voice, lines such as Let's get some apple juice down here! would be merely cute; with Willis' smoky growl, they are hysterically funny. "},{"Title":"An underrated gem and one of the best comedies of the 80's ...","Date":"9 November 2011","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" Look Who's Talking is an enjoyable and entertaining comedy whose best achievement is to tackle very adult subjects with never falling in the trap of crude and unreasonably vulgar humor, the material contains very explicit sexual undertones, yet from beginning to end, it's still an original, a daring and endearing film, and yes &#x85; maybe one of the best comedies of the 80's.I might be biased by using the word 'best' since the movie has always been one of my favorite as a child, and one of the few that I could recite line by line, scene by scene, but I trust my maturity even as a 10-year old kid, I have an alibi, I didn't like the sequel even at that time, so I know I loved the film not just because it was featuring sexual material or a kid talking like an adult, it was a funny, warm and entertaining story. And to understand why this film is great on so many levels, you just need to watch the sequels.In fact, the whole Look Who's Talking premise, which is about hearing the kid's thoughts, spoken by an adult voice, Bruce Willis, as original and clever as it is, would have been pointless if the film wasn't driven by a real story that could appeal to the parents who'd come with their kids in the theater. If the baby was the focus, it would have been a cute but forgettable film just like Baby's Day Out, something funny but without substance, or worse, a cult oddity à la Howard the Duck, but Amy Heckerling's film was about a mother looking for a fatherly figure to raise her son. And even this synopsis could have lead to a lesser film, if it wasn't for a nice touch of casting with Kirstie Alley as Mollie, and John Travolta as James, the first come-back before Pulp Fiction. There's something so natural growing between these two actors, who were not big stars at that time, and maybe that contributed not to distract the film from its simplicity. In a way, this is what makes the film slightly better, or more appealing than When Harry Met Sally&#x85;, because it doesn't look marketed to touch hearts, simple actors, a cast of honorable supporting stars, George Segal, Olympia Dukakis, Abe Vigoda, no big stars, but a great story &#x85; although, for the movie's defense, I think it should have garnered some Golden Globe nominations in the Comedy/Musical category, if only for the lead roles.What makes the Alley-Travolta duo work, beyond the well-written script, is the great chemistry both have together, something that takes its time to become a reality, but when it happens, we know we're not watching cinematic clichés but real people. There's also another element, which is the genuine and authentic love both have for Mikey, the baby. Mollie doesn't play a mother, she's a real mother, as tough, vulnerable, hysterical or passionate as any other, and the complicity between James and Mikey is one of the things that I think touched me the most as a kid. James was more than a baby-sitter, he was a buddy for Mikey, and isn't this the true cement of a father-and-son relationship, being best friends?Again, the film deals with these subjects without flirting with stereotypes, it has the guts to evoke artificial insemination, to feature a hilarious scene of fecundation with spermatozoa riding their way to the targeted ovule following the Get Around Beach Boys' song, and it's always fun and charming because the material is treated with the level of humor that doesn't make you feel guilty to appreciate what you watch. That way, the movie is worth many Sex Ed programs indeed, my little brother never had to ask how we 'made babies' after this. The movie also features some borderlines lines as when the mother says that the artificial insemination is the kind of thing a girl does if she's very ugly or a lesbian. Offensive? Maybe &#x85; but wouldn't a mother talk like that to her daughter? This is the film's strength, every character speaks truly, the way we would expect and all these realistic interactions with the baby Mikey as the sentimental core, provides a great comedy film and so many memorable moments, among which my favorite, is the great dance sequence between John Travolta and the baby with I'm Walkin' on the Sunshine. There is one part where Travolta holds Mikey in his arms and a smile of joy which in no way, looks acted, I know the Pulp Fiction dance sequence will forever be revered as one of the greatest Travolta's moments but this one will always come as a close second in my memories.Look Who's Talking is a charming little film, with 'little' as a compliment, it never tries to exceed the limits of its ambitions, and is short enough not to drag on some parts, the music, the writing, the characterization, everything contributes to create this enjoyable feeling. And to end on an anecdote, I watched the film videotaped and for some reason, my dad stopped the recording right when the ending credits started, so I never saw the scene where they visit Mollie with her newborn baby Julie, the scene announcing the second opus. Apparently, Heckerling was already planning to make a sequel, but when Look Who's Talking was over, when we knew who'd be Mikey's father, when we heard his cute little voice, and saw what a movie where we could hear the voice of baby would look like, then what was the purpose of a sequel? How could have it been as original or appealing? I would have asked 'why' myself if I saw this, and this is why I failed to appreciate the sequel as a kid, and even more as an adult.

I love the opening scene when they show the sperm fertilizing the eggs (if you are a parent and can't talk to your kids about where babies come from, play this scene. It's educational and entertaining) I also liked the fact that they showed Grandpa Ubriacco and James trying to find him a decent home. This film was well written and this is one of the best films that never gets old, dull or stupid. Anyone who thinks so doesn't have half a brain.It shows how some Fathers can be (biological) and never be there and how some men are selfish while others would be. I LOVED the scenes where she's dating all those men and showing us how they are My ultimate favorite scene is the one where she's on the clock and her biological clock is ticking. This scene I liked because it put such a hilarious spin on something for men, that wouldn't be seen as much of a problem. I also loved Olympia Dukakkis in this movie also.Everything was well written and well thought out and Amy Heckerling did a great job of directing, I'm not sure if she wrote. Another good one of hers is Johnny Dangerously.I absolutely loved Bruce Willis's voice of Mikey. He was the perfect voice for him.This film rocks! It's better than a lot of these crappy remakes Hollywood is responsible for, and still funny though it's almost as old as me "}{"Title":"LOVE this movie","Date":"27 July 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" Look Who's Talking is one of my favourite feelgood movies - the kind you watch when you just want to sit back, laugh, and not have to think too much.Kirstie Alley plays Mollie, a 30-something accountant who finds herself pregnant by her sleazy married boyfriend (played annoyingly well by George Segal). After he abandons her for yet another mistress, she meets James (John Travolta), the cabbie who drives her to the hospital when she goes into labour.The story that follows is par for the romantic comedy course - James falls in love with both mother and baby, while Mollie (at least initially) only sees him as a platonic friend and babysitter/surrogate father figure for son Mikey. She searches relentlessly for a suitable father for the child - dating a series of losers and even briefly attempting a reconciliation with Mikey's bio-dad. It takes her awhile, but she finally realizes that the right man has been right under her nose the whole time.Bruce Willis is a hoot as the voice of baby Mikey - and the little boys who play Mikey are suitably adorable. The soundtrack music is fantastic, featuring the likes of Janis Joplin, The Beach Boys, and the Talking Heads.Alley and Travolta have amazing on-screen chemistry, whereas Alley and Segal have virtually none - which, of course, is the whole point. Olympia Dukakis also has some funny scenes as Alley's meddling mom; as does Abe Vigoda as Travolta's senile grandpa.Alley's character Mollie may be a bit unsympathetic at first - she is, after all, the other woman in an extramarital affair. But before long, you find yourself rooting for her to find true love and a father for her son. The movie is not perfect - it has it's share of flaws. But overall, there's not much to dislike. It's just plain fun to watch. A definite thumbs-up.

The only two sexual encounters in this movie result in pregnancies, the first unwanted though the second is wanted. The first pregnancy is also very much a result from a sleazy guy married to a new age woman and uses all of his charm to get what he wants, and though he is a wonderful guy at the beginning, one quickly begins to see right through him.This movie is about a woman who has a baby and the father is not really all that interested so she decides to search for another father. The cab driver that took her too the hospital ended up being in the operating theatre when the baby was born and ends up being the babysitter. The twist in this movie is that we hear the babies' thoughts, and Bruce Willis seems to be a natural at this. I can just picture Willis having a lot of fun doing Mikey's voice-over.I guess this movie is working with an unusual concept, that of the baby's thoughts being heard, to drive the point of the fact that a baby needs a father. We have a couple of times when the baby wonders who the guy is that takes other babies away. Unfortunately the success of this movie meant that two sequels and a series were spawned from it which I don't think pushes the theme that this movie does.Personally I find that this movie is not as funny as I remembered it to be. There are a few really good lines though I did not think that having the baby talk added that much to it. It is interesting to see how people misinterpret the baby's actions, such as Mikey pulling out a photo of Jack saying that he wants Jack as his father while the others think he wants to see photos.Look Who's Talking was in its own way different when it hit the screens, but it was not that impacting that it sticks in the minds of people now. If mentioned we know what they are talking about but generally it has not gone away forgotten. "},{"Title":"If I could describe this movie in one word, it would be.

They aren't married, so Mollie claims it was artificial insemination. One day, Mollie finds Albert cheating on her so it was over between them. But then, her water broke and she had to be rushed to the hospital. Who should happen along but cab driver James Ubriacco. The midtown traffic was a disaster but James drove as fast as possible. Mollie's baby was soon born. He was named Mikey. He began to comment in his mind about everything he saw.         James dropped in on Mollie one afternoon to return her purse which she had left in the cab. James even took Mikey out while Mollie took a nap. They went to go visit James' grandfather in a rest home and to the air field because aside from being a cab driver, James was a pilot. Mollie expressed her distaste of James unexpectedly taking Mikey out by hitting him; Mollie was looking for a suitable father figure for Mikey and James looked like a sure winner, but she won't even consider James. She dates several other guys while James babysits Mikey. He teaches him to dance and we all know John Saturday Night Fever Travolta is a heck of a dancer. But as luck would have it, Mollie and James begin to get close. Albert comes by one day and meets James, who interrogates Albert on what Mikey's favorite cereal was, how many diapers he goes through a day, favorite rock star, standard stuff a father should know. Albert also proved dull when Mollie and Mikey go to visit him. So that was it for him.      James takes Mollie flying one afternoon. They go to visit James' grandfather and the events of the day are as follows Mikey experiences what driving a car is like and Mollie and James finally fall in love; It's a pretty good movie. John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are good. Olympia Dukakis, Abe Vigoda and George Segal are here too! That is Bruce Willis doing the voice of Mikey! The original cast would return to do Look Who's Talking Too! Then they did Look Who's Talking Now where Mikey has grown up to the stage where he can talk on his own but it's the dogs that talk in that one. So in conclusion, I recommend all three of these films. You're looking for a good comedy or like any of the above actors, this one's for you!

Mikey can talk, but only in his head (huh?). Mikey's mum Mollie (Kirstie Alley before the Jenny Craig times) struggles to raise Mikey plus hold a relationship with a man. That is until James (John Travolta, in the early days of his revival, although starring in this has to be a major asterisk on his career) comes along.

And now he's doing stuff like Battlefield Earth and Lucky Numbers. But here's an in-between Travolta vehicle that delivers laughs steadily throughout.Travolta plays James Ubriacco, a cab driver in New York. Kirstie Alley is Mollie, an accountant who is having an affair with a married man, Albert (George Segal), who is currently getting a divorce from his wife. Things couldn't be better...until Albert gets her pregnant.Mollie is fine for awhile (at least as fine as a pregnant woman can be), but then she sees Albert smooching someone else, and that's when she goes into labor. James the cab driver takes her to the hospital (where a witty spoof of The Exorcist takes place) so that her baby boy, Mikey, can be born. Mikey's hilarious voice is by Bruce Willis. Actually, we just he him think, but it's still very funny.James starts to come around more often, and eventually becomes Mikey's babysitter. The rest of the plot revolves around Mikey growing up and wondering about what it's like to have a daddy. He wants James to be his since they spend so much time together, but Mollie goes and dates other people. It was (oh, I hate using this word in reviews) cute, charming and witty. Obviously it was predictable, but what would you expect?I enjoyed Travolta in this role, he seemed to enjoy himself. Alley was fine, as a woman who knew what she was doing. Director Amy Heckerling has made herself known to me, and I enjoy her movies. There are a couple dry spots without laughs, but they didn't matter to me.My rating 7/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor/content, and baby nudity.

Surprisingly, it is a pretty funny film in its own way, even if it is riddled with that 1980s style. This is coming from a female who does not traditionally enjoy romantic comedies. That said, I think that this is a film for those readers who enjoy romantic comedies and films involving in-your-face babies with adult-like views on the world and society.

It's a gimmick that actually does a service to a movie that otherwise would've been just another soapy rom-com about a woman looking for a father for her baby. Mollie (Kirstie Alley, in one of her most memorable performances, chiefly because she's believable and sympathetic most the way), gets knocked up by her boss (George Segal, also quite good as a smug a-hole), and decides to have the baby thinking he might act as the father. He doesn't, and she gets taken to the hospital thanks to cab-driver James (John Travolta, his kinda-sorta mini-comeback in the tail end of the 80s), and he soon befriends Mollie after returning her purse to her after her delivery. Soon a relationship unfolds, but not at first with him as Mollie tries to find someone who will be a *father* to her baby. All the while, the plucky little tyke just wants the guy who makes him laugh the most- and doesn't annoy him by changing the channel when Snuggles the Bear is on.So yeah, a lot of Look Who's Talking, when I think back on it, is pretty cute and almost leans threateningly to the schmaltzy. But what saves it is its fantastic sensibility, mainly in the screenplay where the humor is genuine (however here and there of a sitcom side), and dealing through all of the goofy baby jokes a story and characters that shouldn't be un-sympathetic or even un-empathetic to some viewers. And more often than not, the jokes connect so well that I still grin thinking back to more than a few scenes and lines, like when Mollie- trying one last time- takes Mikey to see his real father, and then as a fight almost breaks out, Mollie breaks a statue, and Mikey follows along (Take that, Tonto!) A terrific piece of casting is done on the supporting side for Abe Vigoda, who is pretty much hysterically funny in any scene he's in. Travolta, too, is surprisingly funny and amiable here, with his charm meter the highest it's been since. Although the ending is probably way too 'uh-oh', and the final little scene in the credits is a cheap set-up for lesser sequel(s) time, this is a movie that works best on its merits of working cleverly in a conventional format, but also with a good, bright soul to it too. I mean, what do you expect from a talking baby movie? Whatever it is, this is probably the best of the bunch.

Can't be the kids, as much as they might enjoy all of the, albeit not really visually graphic, gross-out comedy, seeing as how there are some fairly intimidating sequences throughout(and the language isn't exactly child-proof, either, though it could be worse). The focus is entirely on the single mother and her child, so few men will(willingly) watch. No, this seems to have been made explicitly for the group that the main character belongs to, 30-something single mothers who, in spite of being smart, make stupid decisions(which will annoy women not in that group, I would guess). I watched this for the first time in years, and it's really almost sad how little of it I remembered or recognized. The plot, I suppose, isn't awful, and realistic enough(disregarding the entire premise of the child talking), but it does seem like they merely made up just enough to bring it to 90 minutes, and to tie together the various scenes of the toddler in situations that such would find themselves in, with Bruce Willis doing a voice of what the kid might be thinking/trying to say(well, at least it's not as bad as Garfield, where sometimes, Jon seems to understand the Tabby perfectly, whereas others, he isn't picking up anything but the fact that his lazy pet is trying to communicate), so that the whole movie wasn't just of that(that would have been unbearable, even Hollywood couldn't have asked that of human beings). The humor usually doesn't work. There was maybe one brief point I found amusing, and that was it. The joke of every bit that has Willis doing the voice is that as far back as the womb(which we get a visual of... because that's what we movie-goers are just *dying* to see), our offspring are intelligent, well-spoken... really, the only thing Mikey isn't shown to have, for obvious reasons, is experience. The instances of him talking will amuse some, but once that wears off, you'll find that it's really not funny. At all. The film plods along, at a pace that at times almost seems like a psychological experiment... how much will the viewers take, before they stop watching, with the occasional nightmare. Good pieces of music are used in the movie, where the choice of that particular song is downright frighteningly obvious. And this got two sequels and a TV show.

Its not like in What Women Want where these internal voices we're hearing can actually have an effect on the narrative here the baby is completely impotent, can't express its views to the outside world, and is completely irrelevant to the action.Its strange that a movie which is widely considered a kids or family movie should, on closer examination, seem more like a twenty-somethings flick about womanhood and motherhood.

She tries out a few men not realizing the relationship her son has started with the babysitter (John Travolta). The entire idea of this movie seems like a major mess so it really comes as a great shock to see how loving, caring and downright adorable the picture is. The idea of a single mom trying to find a father for a baby who we constantly get voice-overs from isn't the greatest story out there but the performances are so good, the laughs so big and the heart is in the right place and all of this really adds up to a rather special movie. A lot of the credit for the laughs has to go to Bruce Willis who does a very good job with the voice-overs. His comic timing is dead-on from start to finish but I think the most important thing was how child-like in nature he was. We've had dozens of movies that used voice-overs to try and get laughs but they usually fail because they either try too hard or the comedy is forced but that's never the case here because the work is done with such ease by Willis that you can't help but feel as if you're actually listening to how a real kid would think and talk. Alley is also very good in her part, although I'd probably argue that the screenplay could have toned down on some of her hard-edge because at times you start to question some of her character traits. Olympia Dukakis, George Segal and Abe Vigoda are all good in their small parts but I think the key to the film's success is the performance of Travolta. This was the GREASE stars first major role in years and it would also serve as his first comeback but of course the sequels would lead to his eventual fall before Tarantino rescued him once again. Either way, the performance here is so great that you really can't help but fall in love with his character. Travolta does a remarkable job at just being so adorable, so caring and so protective of the child that you want to see them together. Being a Travolta movie you can expect a dance sequence and how they pull it off here is incredibly fun and touching. Every single second of the movie is predictable from a scene where Travolta gives some tips to a guy looking to take Alley out to the ending but that really doesn't matter. Heart is a hard thing to get into any film let alone a comedy but this film really hits it out of the part. Mix in the terrific soundtrack and you've got a perfect little gem.
