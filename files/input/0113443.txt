Then Nick is diagnosed with HIV.  Brandon promises to not leave him---but eventually does.  He can't handle The HIV.  A year later Nick is told he will die very soon of lesions in the brain.  Rather than slowly become a vegetable and wither away, Nick decides to commit suicide.  He invites all of his friends to a 2 day party--at the end, he'll take the pills and die.  Brandon finds out and attends the party.  But does Nick want him there and will Nick be able to forgive him before he goes?Strong, powerful movie.  I saw it in a theatre in 1996 and cried my eyes out.  I saw it 2 years later with a friend and we BOTH cried our eyes out!  Saw it again tonight--cried again.  This drama is harrowing at times and brings about questions about love, death with dignity, suicide, HIV...etc etc.  But it never gets too maudlin and is always fascinating. Roberts is just superb as Nick.  Strong, handsome, refusing to wither away.  He also approaches his HIV condition with strength and humor--as he should.  Lee Grant is (sadly) wasted as his mother.  Harrison is so-so as his boyfriend.  Usually he's sort of stone-faced but there were a few moments that the looks on his face made me break down.  There's one scene of him and Roberts just looking at each other across the room--you can see the love, fear and hatred in their faces--it's just great.  And Harrison really delivers during the last 30 minutes of the movie.  There's a huge cast in this movie--Margaret Cho (hilarious); Marlee Matlin (wasted); Olivia Newton-John (just great); Bronson Pinchot (overdoing the bitchiness a bit); Bruce Davison; Roddy McDowall.  There's the problem--there are too MANY characters!  I'm still not sure who McDowell was and Sally Kellerman shows up looking great but--who is she? We're never told.  Also, the party scenes are scattershot--the camera seems to linger around catching certain characters and snatches of their conversations.  I also have a hard time believing that anyone has this many friends and they all keep quiet about him committing suicide.  Still--problems aside this works.  I think this film hit too close for director/writer Randal Kleiser.  Supposedly he went through the same things with his lover.  When this movie was released he couldn't promote it.  It came (and went) very quickly.  That's really a shame.  It's a strong, powerful movie that should be seen by everybody.  And Roberts gives out one of his best performances.  The scene when him and Harrison kiss is heart-breaking.Well worth catching--an excellent drama.  Just bring plenty of tissues--you'll need them!

From that moment on, and up until the end, the tears keep running down my face.By the way, what a great cast for such a moving film!  Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison are exceptional, and they get great support from Lee Grant, Bronson Pinchot, Margaret Cho, Erich Segal, the late Roddy McDowell, and the rest.I think I'll watch this DVD whenever I'm feelig cynical and weary of the events taking place in this world of bigotry, hatred and war.

I was yelling and screaming, Greg!Why?????NOOO!! Yes I am a big fan of the man and I found it very surprising that he took the part as Brandon. After being lovers for 8 years Brandon and Nick are the complete opposite of each other yet they have so much to teach and learn from each other. When Nick gets tested positive Brandon gets scared and after trying his hardest to cope with Nick's illness he backs away from him in fear...maybe even a slight hatred that he is going to die. So they break up, Brandon finds someone else, who is very young and Nick just pretends he doesn't care. 1 year later Nick finds out he has only a few days to live after he discovers he has a brain tumour. He holds a party gathering friends and family. When Brandon turns up out of the blue everyone hates the idea of him being there, even Nick, but Brandon too needs to say goodbye. The actual part that was the saddest is when Brandon discovers that Nick wants his ashes scattered around they place where they first met, as Nick has now planned to kill himself and basically everyone wants to stop him, but know they can't. This was a terrific movie, there wasn't a dull moment, a lot of flashbacks were shown of the relationship Brandon and Nick shared and I think everyone can relate to that it is never easy to lose someone you love especially to death, but it also shows a side of reality that we all have to go sometime and we might as well make the most of life. Eric was terrific as Nick and the way he was trying to avoid Brandon. Gregory was great as Brandon, the emotions of seeing his loved one die slowly and yet still being strong about it for his sake even sitting by his bedside when he dies I think we all want that, to at least have a person by our side so we don't die alone.

However, the occasion is strained by the arrival of Roberts' former lover (Gregory Harrison), seeking reconciliation at the eleventh hour...Randal Kleiser's powerful film - inspired by actual events - feels more like a reunion of showbiz friends than a structured narrative, though the results are often deeply moving. Kleiser's defiant screenplay gives short shrift to the suicide debate (Roddy McDowall's character acts as the Voice of Conscience), and he employs mordant humor to keep mawkishness at bay (at one point, Roberts and best friend Bronson Pinchot launch into a rousing rendition of It's my party / And I'll DIE if I want to!). As you might expect, however, the final twenty minutes are relentlessly, heartbreakingly sad.

This is not Hollywood at its best or its worst, as some have said. Hollywood did not invent this story. Some of the drama was added for effect (some of the conflict, for example), but the events were based on the life (end of life) of Harry Stein. It is difficult to watch because of all of the conflicting emotions; the agonizing effort of the characters trying to be uplifting and funny in the face of devastation.

The fact that Randal Kleiser could get this film made at all is a major accomplishment.  That he could get the cast he did, and get them all to accept scale is another point in his favor.For the record, It's My Party is a film-filtered version of actual events in Randal Kleiser's life (Kleiser corresponds to Brandon, Gregory Harrison's character), in much the same way that Kleiser's earlier film, Summer Lovers, is a film-filtered (and re-gendered, to be sure) version of an earlier period in Kleiser's life.  The film reduces several years of the central gay relationship to about two.  Various art works attributed to Nick in the film are actually works created by Kleiser's late lover.  And yes, the party that the film centers on actually took place, though certainly (one hopes) not as melodramatically.I have to say, I agree that quite a few characters could have been left on the cutting-room floor without marring the film, but at the same time, many of those superfluous characters were played by actors who were working virtually for free because they wanted to be involved in the project.The black comedy in a couple of the scenes was a device that was used to lighten things (however inappropriately, though, is a matter of personal taste) before the heavier side of the film kicked in, more or less a structural device, evidenced by the fact that it didn't return later.The notion that this film is not an accurate representation of the sequence of events involved in PML is certainly valid, but how often does film or theater get terminal disease completely right?  As I mentioned earlier, this was an eight year relationship timeline shortened to about 26 months, and all presented in less than 2 hours.  There are going to be things missing. Kleiser hit the high points -- the fact that Nick's vision is starting to go, something very much feared in a visual artist.Taken as a whole, I loved the film.  Of course, when I first saw it, I was sitting in a theater full of gay men, lesbians, and their closest friends on a rainy afternoon .  You try watching this film under circumstances like that and still come out unaffected.

Although I didn't blame him for his decision to commit suicide, I found it bizarre that he would invite all his friends to a farewell party to say goodbye before he takes his fatal dose of sleeping pills.  That should involve only a few close family members, but there were so many characters in this film I had a hard time sorting them out and wondered why some were invited to the party in the first place.The film focuses on the troubled relationship between the man in question, Eric Roberts, who gives an excellent low-keyed performance as the man in question, and his ex-lover, Gregory Harrison, who kicked him out once Roberts tested HIV positive. There are some moving moments between them as they try to make up. I was also moved by Roberts and his estranged and guilty father, George Segal, trying to resolve their feelings. Acting honors should also go to Devon Gummersall, playing Roberts' upset gay nephew.

A year later, Nick learns he has contracted an AIDS-related disease that will soon be turning him into a vegetable and not wanting to live that way, decides to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of pills and having a huge party the night before to say goodbye to his friends and family.This film sucked me in right from the beginning by establishing that this was first and foremost a love story...the relationship between Nick and Brandon rings true from the beginning and we are so happy when Brandon drops everything to be at the party when he learns about it, despite the initial tension his arrival causes, tension you can cut with a knife.Director and writer Randal Kleiser, who also directed Grease and The Blue Lagoon almost effortlessly ties together the tension of this situation with the bitchy gay sensibilities that would always be prevalent with these kind of characters, evidenced in the constant movie quotes offered by several characters, not to mention the handful guests at the party who are inevitably going to make what's going on all about them. Yes, there are laughs to be found here, but some of them are very nervous ones. The scenes surrounding Brandon's initial arrival at the party and the scenes near the ends where Nick poses for final pictures with his family and friends perfectly display this fusion of humor and tension.Eric Roberts delivers a rich and layered performance as Nick and Harrison gives the performance of his career as Brandon, but what's more important here is the relationship that the two actors create on screen...it's completely believable and has us rooting for them from the beginning. It's why we want to cheer when it is revealed that Brandon broke up with the guy he left Nick for and came to the party because he wants him back.Kleiser has assembled a superb ensemble cast behind the leads that delivers the goods, especially Bronson Pinchot as a fast talking agent, Margaret Cho as Nick's favorite hag, Marlee Maitlin as Nick's sister, Paul Regina as Nick's new lover, and especially Lee Grant, in an Oscar- worthy performance as Nick's mother, who walks the delicate line between blaming herself for what's happening to Nick and making it all about her.Yes, it does play like a photographed stage play, but a really good one and though not for all tastes, a very special experience for those who are game, and yes, I did shed a few tears along the way.

Movies centering on big, noisy parties rarely work, but Kleiser's accuracy in capturing this (not all gay) eclectic group of family and friends shows off a great deal of heart, sentiment, and a small bit of the requisite bitchy humor. A wonderfully odd gathering of celebrities and character-actors pop up in cameo roles, however the leads (Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison) are the most surprising; with the help of astute editing, they are able to create a rapport that seems heartfelt and real, and Roberts in particular does some of his best work ever.

Not wanting to live life in any sort of semi-conscious state, he decides to commit suicide in a rather dignified way before the stages of disease advance any further. The Party, in the title of this film, refers to the sort of substitution of a funeral for a party, one in which Nick, his friends, and family will gather around to enjoy the last few good times they might have together. He wants no sorrow and no tears and certainly no funeral or wake. This is how he wants to say goodbye.Nick will be among many of his friends to have died from the disease, although this film relegates the disease solely to that of homosexual men, which I would caution in Hollywood because of the misconceptions that is a disease that only affects gay men. But nonetheless, this is the story of a gay man who has seen many of his friends die to the disease. The particularly sad thing is that you share among the assorted celebration (although not all of it is a particularly joyous occasion obviously because people are aware of Nick's plan to end his life) and in the end, the viewer may be fooled by their Hollywood conditioned expectations that somehow Nick will live in the end and everything will be okay.This is one film with a particularly familiar and good cast which join together in sort of an awareness project that reminds me of the Laramie Project made some time later. This, at least according to the trivia, is based on actual events that occurred in the early 90s.

Do yourself a favor...see this movie ...you will not regret it....education is the best way to avoid prejudice and hate..this movie does that as well..it educates, even if on a small level what this horrible virus ends up doing to people. This is a true story and the characters were reflecting their real life counter parts, and this film could not show it any better than it did, what it is really like for someone saying farewell...or see you later. I wish I would have known the real person Nick, since it is obvious he was such an influence to everyone around him, in such a positive way. Eric Roberts shows that Nick was such a good and forgiving person...who had laughter in his heart even until the end..who cared so much for his friends and his family that he gave them a party as well as gifts ..the party I don't believe was for him, but he did it for the one's he cared about. What a truly amazing person Nick must have been..to those of you who did know him..you are truly blessed. To the director of this film Randal Kleiser, who I understand made this film as a sort of sound board for the pain he feels...THANK YOU!!!!!

This is probably to me one of the best representations of a person holding on to their dignity until the end. And when it comes down to it, that's all one has in the end, their dignity. Watching someone you love more than life itself slip away from you and grow old before your eyes is something I would not wish on my worst enemy. Eric Robert's character has obviously celebrated his life to the fullest and now he is celebrating the ending of it in a manner which to me is sincere, humorous, and given to appreciate those around him who have made his life special. This is one of his best performances I've seen and I am someone who enjoys his movies. Maybe because this is a departure from his usual roles is what makes it good. He's very gracious in this role.

Most of the actors, especially Olivia Newton John, Margaret Cho, Lee Grant, Gregory Harrison, and Marlee Matlin all turn in great performances as friends and family of the AIDS afflicted Nick (Eric Roberts). Time and setting falls away in the faces of these people. Their relationships with one another (especially Nick) become the focal point of the film.

Their eventual separation is shownin tiny scenes in between credits in the opening minutes of thefilm. Roberts moves into another house, taking most of theirmutual friends with him, and over a year later Roberts throws agiant two day party. He invites everyone he knows, from hisestranged father to his agent (he is an artist and house designer)to Harrison, who has not had contact with him in all this time.Roberts has taken a turn for the worst, forgetting things, tunnelvision, and poor coordination. So why throw a party? Roberts plansto end his life at the end of the evening.Director Kleiser, who also wrote this, takes a massive ensemblecast and keeps them reined in enough to be effective, but givesthem enough freedom to be entertaining. His approach his veryun-Robert Altman, where characters step on each other trying toget his attention. Here, the film is anchored around Roberts andHarrison, and the rest of the cast are friends and family having ahard time saying goodbye.This would make an incredible stage play, easily, but the film itselfnever gets claustrophobic or boring in its very few sets. GregoryHarrison has also never been better as the film director who issemi-invited by Roberts, and pretty much told to leave by everyonewho cares about Roberts. Eric Roberts plays Nick so well, you getthe feeling you know someone who acts just like him. Nick is nosaint, and Roberts' and Bronson Pinchot's jokes about hisupcoming suicide are in bad taste, and the rest of the cast is ill atease knowing the soon to be departed is finally stepping away.As with any good film, knowing the outcome of the story does notruin the journey getting there. Many actors have cameos, somehave few or no lines, relationships and friendships sometimes arenot clear, but I thought this filmed party was a lot like real parties inthat respect. The overwhelming sadness of the final scenesshould have you in tears, and probably because, as one characternoted, Nick is able to wrap everything up with everyone he knowsbefore he goes. This is not a statement about death with or withoutdignity, just an honest statement, and one we should follow in ourdaily lives. What would happen if the sun came up tomorrow andyou or I were not here? Who are the people out there who wouldnever know the impact they had on your life, and vice versa? Thisis a powerful film with a powerful message, especially in thesefew months following the horrific attacks. It will be a long timebefore I can shake this film, and maybe I never will, but I never will lforget it. I definitely recommend this.This is rated (R) for profanity, brief female nudity, some sexualreferences, some drug abuse, and some adult situations.

While this film is flawed, it makes one think hard about serious subjects, and I found it extremely touching.  I was certainly moved to tears, if not sobs, throughout most of it.Eric Roberts is heartbreaking as a man who has it all - looks, talent, wit - only to come down with AIDS, have his lifetime love break up with him, and face imminent death.  While Gregory Harrison was capable, I felt this could have been a really fine film with an actor who was the equal of Roberts. George Segal was surprisingly touching, as were Margaret Cho and Marlee Matlin. As a straight woman, it's all too easy not to think about AIDS too often.  I found myself thinking about these issues, looking up articles, and really considering some of the questions this movie poses, not only about AIDS, but about focusing on what counts in your life while you are alive.Be warned - this is a full box of kleenex film, but one that will leave you moved and thinking.

Actually, I like the whole cast, especially Bronson Pinchot as Monty and Margaret Cho as Charlene.The music adds much to the atmosphere, too.It might be different approach to life and different believes, but the plot itself seems rather strange to me. Yes, I understand pretty well, that It's My Party has little to do with AIDS problem or gay love. As most of the posters mentioned here it's about our right to pass away with dignity and in chosen time rather than to turn into vegetable, about how important the friends and family is, etc. Yes, I agree with all this. Though, certainly, I wouldn't like to come across this vegetable dilemma myself.But I understand young Andrew (Devon Gummersall) who finds all this farewell party a sort of unfair. Could anyone of you imagine yourself as a guest at a party like this? What would you do? What would you feel? I think that only a very limited circle should have been invited to share Nick's last day. Actually, there IS a very limited circle Nick's mother (Amanda), his best friends (Charlene and Monty), Nick's relations (Daphne, Andrew and Lina), Nick's doctor (Tony), Nick's lost-and-found father, finally. But what other people are doing there is a mystery to me. Most of them are just wandering at the background, without approaching Nick, eating, drinking, enjoying the party while poor Nick's female relatives had to spend their time in the kitchen, cooking new snacks for all that crowd. No wonder that finally Amalia got furious and asked Tony to get all these unknown to her people out before the dark because she wanted to spend his son's last minutes with him. She should have done this earlier, actually.To people who really cared about Nick these two days must be a torture, and I think he should have thought about this. I don't think he could feel relaxed himself because every single instant he remembered of what he was going to perform. His vision which was getting worse every hour, the fact he had to explain each new guest the reason why he was summoned to the place, the food he had to reject - all these reminders must be very painful for him, too. But in any case he did what he wanted but the people who stayed after, how many months they would spend guzzling sedative to survive this experience?And I've never cried, sorry. Yes, it was touching to see them step by step getting closer to each other. I liked Brandon's clumsy attempts to find his way to Nick's heart, I liked the admiration you can read in Charlene eyes, when she looked at Nick. Monty is just great, in every aspect! Andrew is very touching. I wasn't upset at the end of the movie, I can say I felt a sort of satisfied. He did what he wanted, no suffers, the closest and dearest friend by his side... what else?Speaking about different approach to life... I think this situation would never happen in Russia, and here are three possible endings of a farewell party in Russian style 1) Guests just didn't allow Nick to take his pills having persuaded him that he would be great and all these doctors are just waste of time and money. 2) Guests followed Nick's example just because of compassion. 3) Most probable both Nick and his guests felt so involved into the party process that they kept celebrating this non stop for a week, until nobody could tell what they are celebrating, in fact.Please, be sure, I have no intention to offend anybody's feelings.I do like the movie, I do like the acting, the music, I think it's one of Eric Roberts' best movies.

Granted, the message is about death and dignity, but it miseducates the viewers in the process.  Not everyone dies of PML (I've had it since late 1996), and the people who do certainly aren't capable of having parties if they're within 2 weeks of losing it.  This film was a huge obstacle for me when I told people of my illness.  Some had seen it, and immediately applied the knowledge they'd gained as the context for the disease.  This simply was not accurate information, for the most part.Aside from the portrayals of fact, I found the acting to be forced, the dialogue melodramatic (at times just plain silly), and the flow of the story to be caught up with too many details and superficial characters who didn't really belong.  The only notable performance was Bronson Pinchot, who stole every scene he was in, to the point where he sometimes carried the film on his own.This film was annoying, overly long, poorly cast and badly acted.  No character seemed real, and I couldn't identify with any of them except Pinchot's.  The whole affair seemed more reminiscent of the cheesy soap opera Ryan's Hope than a party of friends.

He therefore throws himself a farewell/suicide party.The large number of attendees include family members, an ex-lover (Gregory Harrison), and friends both gay and straight. Sharp-tongued fag hag Charlene (Margaret Cho) is among the latter, but if you expect humor from Ms. Cho or anyone else, you're in for a disappointment.In fact, given the comic caliber of the cast (which includes Lee Grant, George Segal, and Bronson Pinchot), the resulting glum-fest seems intentionally perverse. Humor is desperately needed, but this film is too P.C. to recognize anyone's solemn self-involvement. There's something terribly earnest and icky about the whole enterprise. If it had been about any other disease, it probably wouldn't have felt half as condescending.

Interesting only (and only briefly) from a sort of historical perspective on Hollywood's (mercifully brief) goody-two-shoes approach to AIDS, it helps explain Gregg Araki and the rest of the rebound, which was, more than anything, a demand for an end to stories about rich, squeaky-clean white boys who die beautifully while spouting deep philosophy about the Meaning of it All. So incredibly painful to watch.... Most of the scenes played hardest and most desperately for emotion and tears simply make one laugh at how inept and Hallmark they are. Eric Roberts, never a great actor, is utterly unbelievable here, but only slightly less so than the cross-eyed Gregory Harrison as his lover. Marlee Matlin does the standard turn she did in the 1990s in every politically correct film ever made; George Segal is pathetic; and Lee Grant plays her tragic role with all the subtlety of a meat ax. The soundtrack is soupy and sappy, and you need only compare what Randal Kleiser got out of Bruce Davidson in this film with what Norman René got out of him in _Longtime Companion_ (1990) to understand that Kleiser is a rank amateur. I can only imagine that some diabetes-inducing sentiment along the lines of let's make a film for 'the boys' is what got this cadre of red-ribbon wearing stars to participate in a travesty of such monumental proportions; at this point, the only kindness would be to burn all the copies and pretend it never happened.

The premise is that a man, dying of AIDS, has decided to throw an all-out party where he will announce that he will commit suicide. An engaging extrovert, he displays the frenetic optimism precisely found in manic-depressives or people who tend to carry a load with stoic abandon until they no longer can carry it by themselves. Of course, this movie never bothers to truly dive in deep into Nick Stark's (Eric Roberts) psyche -- all we know is what we know and we're given some access into his past via flashbacks, but even then, they only serve as a point of reference, never as a true picture. And then, predictably, his ultimate decision, which is so ridiculous that I wondered if Nick wasn't really a woman pretending to be a man. Talk about a tragic heroine! At least Lee Remick has more to do as his mother, and oddly enough, the movie totally forgets about her and chooses instead to concentrate solely on the mechanics of the party, Nick's botched relationship with Brandon (Gregory Harrison) who left him when he learned of Nick's illness and has come to (maybe?) make amends, and scenes that spell Cute and Tender all the way. I didn't buy it then, I still don't buy it now, and I certainly can't recommend a movie where a gay man decides that the best way to go is with a bang, even at the expense of family members and close friends. That's the ultimate act of selfishness, even if this is only a story. There will be some sentimentalists out there who will weep their eyes out at the sole mention of this pile of dreck, but not me.

Someone with AIDS, their family and friends coming to terms with it.  If you've seen Boys on the Side, Love! Valour! Compassion!, Philadelphia, or In the Gloaming you have no reason to see this because it brings nothing new and is positively lame in its execution. Philadelphia at least did not try to bring in macabre comedy to a truly horrific subject matter. Why does Hollywood feel that to discuss AIDS one has to make light of it?You have two truly bland actors playing the leads, Eric Roberts the dying man (who looks healthy as a horse, but plans to commit suicide before he starts to lose his functions), and Gregory Harrison the ex-lover, who now regrets not standing by his man when he came down with AIDS. During the house party, the ex-lover looks at him soulfully, trying to get a moment alone with him to make amends, while the rest of the miscast family and friends wander around trying to make small talk. The mother is played by Lee Grant, recognizable only through her voice (even though she's doing a fake accent), because post-plastic surgery she no longer has her original face; Olivia Newton-John is his perky sister, whom you expect to get up and start singing and dancing; Roddy McDowall, the stodgy older guest who is earnestly against the planned suicide while the rest of the gang stands around supportively and woodenly thinking it's just fine; and a number of other characters that would seem just fine in a Fellini film. The only believable actors are Bronson Pinchot, who truly looks gay and whose humour doesn't appear forced, and Marlee Matlin, who manages to make her role touching rather than a parody.There is a problem in casting straight actors in a gay story; it is very hard to suspend disbelief when they don't even try to take on the little nuances of a character that would make you believe in him. Why was it possible to believe the straight Tom Hanks was gay in Philadelphia? Because he can act, and the movie was not an AIDS exploitation film, but a movie rightly filmed as a tragedy.It's My Party feels like a high school production; the dialogue is silly, the situations are tragic but are made to be whimsical, and there is zero believability. At no time can you get drawn into a story about a man choosing to kill himself rather than get sicker and die in pain when it is treated in this lighthearted and shallow way. And especially when he looks so fit and healthy.The actors are doing their best with the roles, but the roles have no substance and mostly the story has no point. The aimless party guests take away from any possible plot development with the reunion of the ex-lovers.This was a tedious viewing experience which seemed thrown together by people trying to do a serious, topical story but ruining it by also trying to make it entertaining. A standard tearjerker-wannabe which doesn't work.
