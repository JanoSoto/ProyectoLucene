This is not to be confused with Lords of Dogtown, that sorry Hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original Dogtown revival. Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s Bones Brigade, and co-written with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from Southern California's mean streets (known as Dogtown) who formed the Z-Boys skateboard team (actually there was one girl--Peggy Oki) revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews from nearly all of the Z-Boys (Chris Cahill's whereabouts are unknown) with the most noteable being bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, who's talents (along with Perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. There are interviews of the team's (and the Dogtown shop) founders, surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom, and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews of folks like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi), and Henry Rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when Dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains). It really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks (pool skating became immensley popular, and thus gave way to vert skating), but also facilitated the sport (though not into the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were long over as the Dogtown, at least through the publicity of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step.It's a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the Bones Brigade mini movies/skate demos like Ban This and Search for Animal Chin. Narrated by Sean Penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains lots of terrific archive footage, and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the Z-Boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.

It did what it was supposed to do.. and that was to tell the story of a certain time, place and people. Maybe the Z-Boys weren't choir boys (and one girl) but they were real people (kids) and they took the whole idea of skateboarding to new levels... I absolutely enjoyed this movie.. not only because I am from Dogtown (Venice/ Mar Vista/ S.M (south of Wilshire)), used to skateboard (I sucked) and that I dealt with the Z-Boys a few times when they were using my aunt's pool and were scaring my grandma.. but because this movie was about them (the Z-Boys) and the time and the place. Sure there was a semi skateboard culture in the 60's that died out pretty quickly... but the Z-Boys restarted the whole skateboard thing again.. and not only did they restart it; they resurrected and recreated it. Nowadays it is almost a regular thing to see some guy flying out of a pool or a half pipe getting air, etc.. But back then it was something new. They revolutionized the whole thing. There were electric guitars and guitar players before Hendrix but he took it to a whole different level and what he left in his wake is the same thing the Z-Boys left in their's.To the people who seem to want to criticize the movie or the Z-Boys for talking about themselves.. well the movie was about them.. Remember what it is like to be young and invincible.. and to revolutionize something that they loved by just doing what they loved.. sure it is easy to get an ego.. just ask a kid who learns how to finally play a Hendrix song on a guitar... it is the same thing except the Z-Boys defined the revolution that was to come. They were young, brash and from a place that was a slum by the shore. Sure it was wrong to trash and terrorize people who came to their beach or whatever.. but by the same token.. people from this side of the hill would get a lot of abuse when they went to the Valley or other areas. That doesn't make it right but it does make it what it was. There was a sectional divide in the greater L.A. area. The Z-Boys just happened to be at the forefront of the beach wars.The Z-Boys rocked and they weren't perfect angels but they were real.. look what happened to Jay Adams.. They were part of the times and places that was the L.A. beach scene.Finally, I think the style of this movie fit the subject very well. Stacy Peralta was part of the Z-Boys and he did this film as a tribute to what they were all about. It was a rebellion not for the sake of ego but for the sake of something they all enjoyed doing. The camera work, the (killer) soundtrack and the memories were great. The best part, though, might have been the fact that they themselves seemed to document their own history with still pictures and film.To quote the Surf Punks, My beach, my waves, my chicks, go home.Rock on!!!!

By the time the cast came off my arm, summer was gone.But I have always admired the X-games types and surfers especially. I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California on the beaches and piers watching the surfers, bemoaning that fact that I had missed my calling. It's the sort of thing you should learn young, before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness burrow in. Or else at best, you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at, you'll wind up looking like a trained bear.I always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment, that wave, that experience. At one with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. There's a lot of Zen in it to me.This documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. In their day and time, this was all new. radical. Prior to the Zephyr Skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace like tumble down the front walk.This film is a look back through time, to an America before EVERYTHING was labeled, tagged, marketed, and jam-forced down our throats as Extreme. (Seriously, what's so extreme about an Extreme value meal at Taco Bell? Other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon...) Watch this film and watch the birth of 'extreme sports'. Before there was an X-games, before Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons, before the ASA...there were these young street urchins who created 'extreme sports' without really trying. They were just doing it for the purity, the pure pleasure, of skateboarding in the sun with friends. I hope they get a cut of the 'extreme' money out there. Goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. Maybe this film can correct that.Excellent film with a great soundtrack, a portrait of a Southern California, indeed an America, that no longer exists.I don't care for Sean Penn but he does a decent job narrating.

Directed by Stacy Peralta, one of the legends of the sport, it captures the punk rock spirit of skate boarding, and perfectly places it into context within the boundaries of time (the 1970s) and location (a neighbourhood between Santa Monica and Venice, California). Even if you are not a fan you'll be fascinated by the story, which is told using a combination of narration, stills, great vintage 1970s skate boarding footage and new interviews with all the key players. Sean Penn provides the narration, and adds a flair all of his own. The opposite of stodgy, Penn speaks to the audience not at them, sounding like someone sitting at a bar telling the tale. At one point in mid-sentence he coughs, pauses for a moment and then continues. It's this kind of approach that gives this movie its edge.

Film for me is a matter of conversations between different parts of myself and various personalities (and virtual personalities as elements) within the project. This requires a certain synthesis of the reality in and of the film. Most documentaries, the journalistic ones, cannot acknowledge the synthetic nature of what they show.No so here. The topic is one that interests kids making up something that has no purpose other than being a vehicle for style - and it carrying that meme of style to millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of kids. A question of expression completely in line with what happened to our music and dress for a long while before the counterforces of hiphop and country developed.Cool. And as with so many such successful, youth-driven revolutions, this one was invented by savvy journalism. These same journalists now do a metajob on reporting both the phenomenon and how they created it. Along the way, they have copious interviews with the players.The same style is used in the film as in the skating, which is a practiced but of course not entirely committed ragginess. There is no mention of the sex and little note of drugs except that the star skater (perhaps the only one that was truly committed) is now incarcerated. He is a completely dulled individual now, the walking dead.So we have double folding journalism about journalism about self-journalism. The style of style.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

By the 1970's, the one remaining local attraction, the Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. The poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. Because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. I found that the film covered much more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like a bonus since I really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before I watched the film. The soundtrack, not surprisingly, was good as well. I also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. The parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's somewhat overinflated sense of self-importance (although this is probably just left-over street attitude from where they grew up). This is not to say that they didn't have significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. One note My wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as SpastiCam (wiggling camera movements). This film is often guilty, so if you are so afflicted, be warned. I would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and/or surfing in their history.Seen on 5/11/2002.

That being said, I thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary.  Some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit, but what the hell? It looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. It's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in California provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. I never would have realized where extreme skating came from, but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary.

The reality is that they DID revolutionize skateboarding, they WERE the impetus behind extreme sports and they DID inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana.

I begged my parents for money to by a second-hand skateboard from a friend.  It was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything.  I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the Dogtown crew.  Skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.This film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating.  Watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack-jawed for 90 minutes.  It's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film, and thank god for that.  The footage is brilliant.  It gave me the feeling of watching an old Buster Keaton film I've seen some of the tricks Keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless.  That's the feeling this film gave me.  Yeah, I've seen people skate pools before, but to watch the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on Keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window.  It's absolutely brilliant to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been tried by almost everyone.This film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a film.  This is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not.  I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest, and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. As for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory, I think that's an unfair disparagement.  I liked seeing these guys get excited about their past.  They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever.  They have the right to pat themselves on the back.  They were stars for doing what they loved to do.  Most of these guys/girls never achieved the staggering success Tony Hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then.  Sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf/skate industry.  How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do?  They can.

So they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. If you were a part of the zephyr team in that time, you where one of the cool guys/girls. Because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team. So they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard. In no time skateboarding was popular again. There were a couple of competitions and one national competition. The zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one. But what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. But the jury didn't now how to judge them.

I think that, if about half to three quarters of the interview footage ofthe Zephyr team telling us what bad asses they were and whatrock stars, they became could have been taken out, I would haveappreciated their talents even more. I guess I'm just one of thosewho thinks that it should be the audience member who gets to seewhat the people accomplish and then sit back and make their ownjudgements about whether or not the subjects are worthy of thatkind of praise.  One thing I really liked about The Last Waltz, was that everyonewho watches it gets to make up their own mind about what kind ofmusical influences the members were.   I think it's kind of ironic that the subjects of this film talk about egogetting in the way of the artistic nature of the sport, but they haven'tseemed to learn anything from it as they sort of ruin this film withtheir grown up ego.

With their low pivotal style, they embarked on a Larry Bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. After the Dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated Skateboarder Magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the Zephyr skateboard team forgot about Jeff Ho, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team put together by Jeff Ho (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and Craig Stecyk (Photographer) included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki (the only female), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo, and David Ray Perry. All of the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still well and surfing/skating. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico.Themes The themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. Other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.Other Works Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigrades, and Lords of Dogtown. He has also done films with a theme of growing up in America as a teenager, films such as Influences From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods Made in America, and The 70s The Decade that Changed Television.Subjects The subjects of Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team excluding Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the Dogtown Articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed.Editing The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time the Zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the Z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. Cinematography The film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the Z-Boys surfing or skating were in color. Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. The interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. All of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which I found very surprising. Music Seasons of Wither-Performed by Aerosmith Toys in the Attic-Performed by Aerosmith Generation Landslide- Alice Cooper One Way Out- Performed by The Allman Brothers Lollipops and Roses and Whipped Cream-performed by Herb Alpert Into the Void and Paranoid- performed by Black Sabbath Godzilla- Blue Oyster Cult Aladdin Sane and Rebel Rebel- David Bowie Fastcars- The Buzzcocks Gut Feeling- Devo I'll Give you Money- Peter Frampton Funk 49- James Gang Ezy Rider and Foxy Lady and Freedom and Bold as Love- Jimi Hendrix Sidewalk Surfing- Jan and Dean Achilles Last Stand and Hot on for Nowhere- Led Zeppelin Six Underground- The Sneaker Pimps Surfrider- The Lively Ones Cat Scratch Fever and Motor City Madhouse and Wang Dang Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent Us and Them- Pink Floyd Bad Boys- The Pretenders Maggie May- Rod Stewart I Wanna be Your Dog and Gimme Danger- The Stooges Children of the Revolution- T-Rex Bad Reputation- Thin Lizzy Disco Inferno- The Tramps Hannah- Rob Trower Rocky Mountain Way- Joe Walsh Old Man- Neil Young La Grange- ZZ TopThe music in the film make the movie. Every one of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not have been called to mind otherwise.

It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr Team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn.The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing. It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in the Zephyr Team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three particular members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team.The interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e. the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present. The documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point. Knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team. Because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.All in all, I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr Team, but into skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.

I'm not paralleling the two but imagine I made a film about the impact on IMDb culture of user bob the moo and had people I know gush about me and them. Now before you start sending me abuse please read on because I am not saying the two are the same &#150; just that you need to keep in mine that this is about the same people who made it. The difference between this and me doing my own is staggering though. Firstly the fact is that this group did have influence and cultural importance and so what if it is some of their own that ending up making the film &#150; somebody was going to so why not them. Anyway the other main difference is that this film is actually very good as it moves slickly through the period, capturing the essence of the lives as I goes.The film benefits greatly from having a huge amount of film and photographs of the people so that we are not just hearing about abstract memories but actually seeing them for ourselves. The editing is quite intense at time but it suits the people and the period as it is rather freewheeling and disrespectful towards convention. It also benefits from having almost all the protagonists as the contributors rather than having celebs who were aware of the action etc and don't have much of value to say. The only film star involved is Sean Penn, who narrates the film with a rather dull tone of voice and a script that is a bit too heavy for its own good; it is sparingly used though and at one point he stumbles over a word and it is left in &#150; which I thought was a nice touch and suited the style of everything else.Overall then this is an interesting and energetic documentary. I'm not a surfer or a skater but yet I found it totally engaging, which speaks volumes about the quality of the material , the delivery and the total structure of the film. Well worth a look as it is fun and informative.

The dedication that these individuals had/have is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded.Unlike most other documentaries, this one was cleverly put together, the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing I have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused. Without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular today.The film explores areas such as the success, such accomplishing new tricks, winning competitions and gathering fame. As well as failures such as injury or burning out.It was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information.

Director Stacy Peralta, who's one of the legendary Z-Boys himself, relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining the snappy rapid-fire editing, ceaseless speedy pace, and raw, gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz, projecting a sense of sheer joy and full-on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold. Better still, this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanticizes its subjects These rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. The ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat Jay Adams rating as the saddest and most tragic He blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail. The other dudes are very colorful and personable as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire Tony Alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work. Marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn. The terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes. But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense It's every bit as dynamic, exuberant and larger-than-life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous Z-Boys themselves.

In other words, if you like good movies, you should see this. But there's more than that...In any field - be it a sport, a profession, an area of scientific investigation, whatever - there are always innovators. By that, I don't just mean people who excel at it. I mean people who go beyond just excelling, to finding a new way to think about it, who take it to a whole different level and redefine what it means. The Zephyr skateboard team were one such group of individuals. And that is what makes this documentary a must see for everyone, not just skate fans - it documents the process whereby people tear sh*t up and change the world in some small way - and it's that very process that makes this a must-see for everyone.Extra points go for all the period footage and amazing photography courtesy of Craig Stecyk - I freaked out when I recognized the picture of Tony Alva from the cover of Fu Manchu's The Action Is Go. It's not very often that an underground movement such as this is so well documented at the time, and that also is vital to making this such a great documentary.And lastly, Stacy Peralta has proven himself to be a renaissance man in his own right - from being a part of the original team to forming the biggest skate company in the world to being such a talented filmmaker - I can't wait to see In Search of Captain Zero.

The point of a good documentary is too enlighten the viewer about a subject he knows little about. The problem being is the protagonists involved in this farce are deluded enough to think the world see them in as high regard as they see themselves. The only feat of astonishment is how they have managed to maintain such big egos for over 30 years. I guess there is always another 12 year old ready to impress.

Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. Peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done. Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true.

The movie is about a Seventies ghetto neighbourhood in L.A. and how kids turn the ruins of past architectural mistakes into something useful...for them.There are burnt down piers to surf through, concrete basins to skateboard in and empty pools to seize and claim for themselves. The kids are almost tribal in nature, sharing hatred towards outsiders, never splitting up and helping each other out.

From broken or dysfunctional home lives and families, a group of surfing kids and teens gathered together as a collective in a poor area in California near the beach (Venice and Santa Monica), mentored by surf-board makers/marketers forming the Zephyr team, they would emerge as pioneers who demolished the traditional methods quite passé as they derived from the fallen collapse of skateboarding in the 60s and brought new moves/style to the sport. Revolutionaries with lots of ego, attitude, personalities, and edginess, these kids would soon move into their own individual paths (some to fame, others to obscurity), leaving behind the Zephyr team which saw the company end prematurely. Dogtown and Z-Boys has great music, some delightful archival footage and photos that bring vitality and energy to an era that lives on in the adults who once were those innovating, skilled boarders/surfers during the 70s, and lively interview subjects grandly reliving the past and acknowledging how it felt and what they were like at the time. Most tragic is Jay Adams' story as he was considered the most talented among the group and because of drugs, the skateboarding skill was squandered and he never benefited from what he contributed to the sport. Stacy Peralta being a part of that whole scene and having nurtured the sport on the skateboard and talent who followed after him has a keen insight on the subject and area where the Zephyr team honed their craft. The Dogbowl, Zephyr's first competition, and the pool invasions during California's major drought where the skateboarders snuck in to homes and took to their back yard pools all are significant highlights. A detailed history of Venice and Santa Monica, surf/skateboard culture, the kids who would later define a brand new way to look at skateboarding, and the 70s for which the subjects existed enrich the documentary. I totally dig pretty much everything about it. The approach Peralta incorporates is rather similar to who and what he is documenting messing with film (speeding it up or backwards, disrupting a flow of information by applying a new chapter just as an interview is ending, or leading montages whenever he sees fit) and/or flooding the doc with lots of interviewees and images/action in rapid succession. But this film always stays on point these people are highly regarded and appreciated. Alva, Adams, and Peralta are the skateboarders with the most focus, while the Zephyr founders and those fortunate enough to be a part of this amazing experience get their just do to a lesser extent. The back slapping is constant so if you don't like seeing these people comment on how awesome each other are, Dogtown and Z-Boys might just annoy/bother you.

Check out the great clip played during the credits. It sounds like a multi-instrumental homage to one of the great surf guitarists, but it's not done by a group that you would expect ... you'll see.

I guess the pre-fabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. Use exhibit A &#150; The Game Plan as evidence of this if you want. So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like Step into Liquid and Billabong Odyssey. I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I wasn't happy. I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. I wanted to know the men behind the myths.Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wow-ed me. This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for. Dogtown and Z-Boys is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again &#150; they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time. I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming &#150; the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.Grade *** ½ out of ***** "},{"Title":"Cuts close to the bone","Date":"23 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Documentary, Sport","Review":" Right there. Good, entertaining and accurate era-feel to most scenes. Enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions. The credits show Peralta from Mar Vista, California.. up the hill from Venice and south of Malibu. I lived there in the Heartbreak Hotel days, pre-Beachboys, next to that surfer kid Bob Cooper up on Wasatch Avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. Old skatekey skatewheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down sidewalk waves. Things were different in each succeeding decade as the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the Warmth of the Sun whitewater freedom and exhilaration of the electric sixties and then into the assertively innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary madness of the weird seventies. The movie gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real.. the source of culturally significant influences. And BTW, there's another movie that has a similarly American street edginess to it, and has the same genuinely unique goodness with laid back realness that helps refine that elusively eternal sense of cool..

Peralta (a well- known skateboarding figure himself) has crafted a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio- cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and gained wide appeal. In addition, his film is rather personal Peralta's first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as both the informed cinematic investigator and the involved participant-subject. In this role, he is a quintessential participant-observer, while gathering together a wide array of personalities whom were integral to this movement and those who were profoundly affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film employs a uniquely stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narration (by Sean Penn) and interviews adopt a rather genuine, unrehearsed form that is akin with the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of sidewalk surfing. The film exhibits the kinetic appeal of a protracted sporting, music video tempered with an archaeologist's sensitivity to the importance of time, place, and circumstance.

As a kid with a skateboard (and eventually a half-pipe and a skate-park) during this period every image and name in this movie hits home.  What seem like exaggerations of the significance of this story matches perfectly with how it was told at the time. Up here in Canada we watched the lives of these guys with intense interest through nothing but the still photography in Skateboarder magazine, and really had no idea if any of it was based in reality. We studied Skateboarder magazine so closely and obsessively, that we could quote the captions for any photograph and describe the clothes, boards, skaters, and pools as though we had been there. When all of these images come to life on the screen it's quite a feeling ... I'd never seen most of these guys actually move before. (we never actually even knew if the photos we were looking at were a second before a fall, or whether the skater pulled it off  ... we also didn't care).Anyway, it's a nicely done film of an insanely documented era. It's a little heavy on the gimmicks (quick cutting in particular ... there were times when I wanted a scene to carry on a little longer instead of rapidly jumping from one to another).  The footage, however, is great and gives you a real feel of the time and place.  It's clear that the makers of the film are quite aware of the image that the audience has in their minds and they touch on all of the aspects of this business that were important to us at the time... smart. I guess the big question is  How does this play to someone who had nothing to do with skateboarding? ... I imagine it has far less impact and some of the personalities come across as baffling or irritating. (I mean, I'm willing to consider Jay Adams to be an enigmatic god-like figure, but who else would?) So, I recommend it, but not everyone is going to care.By the way ... two things that I expected to see weren't there ... the invention of forevers (going back and forth in the pool with losing momentum), and the introduction of the 10-wide board ...

How surf style influenced a diverse team of surfer/skaters in the Santa Monica area and gave birth to the modern era of skateboarding. We see these kids grow from broken-home teenagers to rockstar skateboarders, and how the success and fame was inspiring for some, and devastating for others.The editing and style of the film reflects the raw nature of the people and events it covers. Sean Penn's narration (which was donated free of charge) is excellent, and the interviews are in depth and unforgiving. The real prize of this movie is the amazing super8 footage of the birth of pool skating. Peralta drew from over 40 sources to compile this footage, some of which was shot in the 70s and not processed until the making of this film. The soundtrack is fantastic, with Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Stooges, and other amazing tracks from the era. This film is more than nostalgia, it is an important document of the birth of modern skateboarding. I'm glad the anti-heroes like Tony Alva, Jay Adams, and Peggi Oki might finally get the recognition and respect they deserve as pioneers of style. Many people devoted a lot of time and energy to get this movie made, not to make a profit, but for the love of the subject. Vans shoes put up production money and Sony Pictures Classics has done a tremendous job in distribution, promotion, and support of a project that could easily have slipped-by.

I hadn't been planning on taking in originally, but circumstances led me to it, and I'm very glad that they did.  It may technically be a documentary, but in my book, it's the first REAL rockumentary -- a documentary that truly ROCKS instead of merely chronicling a rock band.The subject is the birth of skateboarding as a cultural phenomenon in the mid 70's and the key role that a rough-and-tumble surfing gang (the Zephyrs) that sprung up around a counterculture surfing shop in a rundown area of Santa Monica (Dogtown) played in elevating the activity above a mere fad.  Out of this small group emerged a whole new style of skateboarding and the first wave of skateboarding superstars (who were quickly co-opted by commercial interests and drifted apart).The film is a collaboration between one of the original members of the gang, Stacy Peralta, and Craig Stecyk, a prominent writer with the early Skateboarder magazine.  They were both on hand for the show, as was another member, Tony Alva.  According to them, a major studio is planning to film a drama on the group, and they wanted to get THEIR take on the story out for people to see before it gets the Hollywood treatment.  To their credit, it doesn't seem particularly self-congratulatory (although some of the group's less-than-legal activities are definitely airbrushed over).Even if you're not a skateboarding enthusiast -- and that would include me -- this is a film that you can't help getting caught up in.  (If you ARE a skateboarder -- and there was a large contingent of them at the screening -- you'll go positively NUTS for it.)  It's got what may very well be the greatest rock soundtrack EVER -- Peralta circulated a 3-1/2 minute short of clips from the film around the music industry, and even classic 70's bands who are notoriously stingy with their works (e.g. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd) wanted in.  The result is wall-to-wall killer music, with the film brilliantly edited to the cuts (rookie editor Paul Crowder sure won't be hurting for work in the future).  Even the talking heads sections rock. Right from the opening scene, where you see a skateboarder approaching to the opening chords of Jimi Hendrix's Ezy Ryder, this is a film that's comin' at ya!It rocks, it soars, it informs effectively, it's dripping with 70's nostalgia, and it tells an upbeat story grounded firmly in reality about a ragtag bunch of lower class kids who were instrumental in launching a major phenomenon on their own terms (at least initially).   Definitely a documentary for movie fans who normally eschew the genre altogether. Horatio Alger for Gen X.

It didn't assume knowledge of skateboarding and the whole 70s California skating scene, but at the same time provided lots of stuff to keep the avid skate fans entertained, with lots of oohing and ahing from audience as several legendary skaters and surfers were featured in the film.The use of old footage and photos was top rate, with the music especially creating a real sense of atmosphere.

It captures a moment in time perfectly through use of rare stock footage and excellent photo stills.  A key role in this films success is found in its soundtrack - Zeppelin, Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Rod Stewart and many more.  The interviews are well paced and keep the piece moving. There are moments of great joy and saddness, held together by Sean Penn's sutle narration.  I heard there are plans to bring this to the big screen - the Boogie Nights of skateboarding!  Can't wait.

I think this movie might have been ranked more highly had I not already seen Lords of Dogtown, which tells pretty much the same story in a non-documentary foremat. I enjoyed Lords of Dogtown quite a bit more purely based on the fact that its just more fun to watch. If documentaries are your thing I'd say go with this, otherwise just stick with Lords of Dogtown.

You don't need to throw blocks of cement and glass at non-locals to get more waves superior skills and local knowledge is usually enough to guarantee the inside section and right of way on waves.

They are used to thrashing apart empty pools and here is this skatecomp with nothing but flatness!.The surfing where they weaved thru the abandoned pier timbers was pretty cool too.It's just too bad many of them were such little b**tards.

The main appeals for me was as a window back on the 70s and onto a sub-culture before it became mainstream and commercialised.  It was great to see people just getting on with what they loved without the pay-cheque being an issue.  It was also interesting to see the very different trajectories that the Z-boys lives took after their commercial breakthrough, and I think more could have been made of this.  I'm sure other groups and individuals were just as influential, and should have been mentioned, but then I think the story that was being told would be lost in a general history of skate-boarding, which I don't think I would find that interesting.     On the down-side it did feel like a bit like a long advert / music video and that someone was going to try to sell me Z-boy t-shirt at the end.Overall, worth a watch for imagery  "},{"Title":"The 60's west coast dried up but the kids' imaginations didn't","Date":"10 October 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Documentary, Sport","Review":" This well-constructed and inspirational documentary is also quite remarkable; the great proportion of the film is compiled from homespun 8mm footage of the surfing and skating that is its subject. Shots of the boys riding the lip of a dessicated pool against the evening sun are appropriately akin to the phoenix bursting from the flames. Despite a ban on surfing and institutional derision both from legal surfers trying to instigate calculated elegance in nascent skating, and society unimaginatively trying to keep the kids from doing something perceived as parasitic and ugly, an astonishing expressive sport blossoms. The Z team, as the gang of urchins becomes known, produce a bastard version of surfing in an unholy alliance with the principles of rock 'n roll and their illicitly snatched experiences in the dried up suburban swimming pools of the district. It's a great metaphor for the decade; and not without pathos. Not everyone involved in creating the wave got to ride it all the way to the present without wiping out.Luckily Steve Peralta doesn't fall into the trap of trying to attach a fake sentiment to this, but allows a discreet voice-over from Sean Penn to tie up the footage that, intercut with contemporary footage and interviews, allows the Daddy of urban 'sport' to speak with its own voice. 7/10 "},{"Title":"not a perfect documentary...","Date":"16 March 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Documentary, Sport","Review":"  This isn't a perfect documentary.  although i was entertained, i think it could have somehow delved deeper into its subjects.  how?  i don't know, maybe revealing more of its seedy underbelly.  maybe interviewing the skater groupies of the era.i skated in highschool and college 1985-1989, so when these guys talk about how much fun it was, i can relate.i have to agree with the reviewer that stated Dogtown should have been half as long.  i felt like i was watching the same footage over and over again.  i also thought the camera movement on many of the photo montages was unnecessary, too quick and shaky.it was an entertaining documentary nonetheless.  i am looking forward to seeing STOKED, the documentary on 80s skater Mark Gator Rogowski.

There's little objectivity here, and most of the time we're witnessing those involved patting themselves on the back, and it's pretty boring.No denying, these Dogtown kids had a huge influence on skateboard culture, and were both hugely talented and highly important figures, but frankly, this movie feels like it was made by them and for them. I can imagine that those without an interest in skateboarding culture would really find this a horribly unimaginative and uninspiring piece of filmmaking. I'm interested in it, yet I felt the same way too.The cut and paste we don't care punk rock style of editing is another annoying factor we've witnessed a million times before in lame MTV videos, so that doesn't help proceedings. Nor do I want to see some guy saying that a skater had the hardest life in the world just because he was a talented boarder who took too many drugs and got in trouble. That isn't a hard life. Try being a kid in a third-world slum who doesn't even have running water or a roof above his head... that's a hard life.So Dogtown & Z-Boys lacks perspective. It's a worthy subject that should've been handled better and in a more objective manner. It feels like everyone involved is way too self-congratulatory, and that's a shame because these important cultural figures instead come across as little arrogant brats who never really grew up... and I know for a fact that they're way more interesting characters than that.

Even if you can somehow summon up interest in this crew of losers, the documentary is badly structured...it follows a straightforward chronological narrative for what seems like a couple of hundred hours, and then just when you think maybe it's finally, mercifully over, it screeches to a halt and backtracks to profile two of the more obnoxious characters, in the process re-covering ground already excruciatingly trod.

It could be that they were low on good raw footage, so needed to stetch it out with F**k with the footage effects.There was interesting and good looking old skate material, just not a lot. And what they had, they cut up and fried. Sean Penn's narration was flat n' lifeless, like either he didn't want to be there, or he didn't give a sh*t, or he can't narrate. Interviews were too long. Soundtrack was ok. Check it out if you want to see early skate footage where no-one really pulls any good tricks because no-one knew how! Pool skating is fun to watch, even when dressed up too much in AfterEffects effects.Too long. Re-edit, ditch Penn, show some modern skating for comparison, and it might have done better here.

However, the film proves that any style cannot sustain the audience's attention for future length by itself.

Some of these little thugs grew up and did alright; others formed their own broken homes, giving life to a new generation of castoffs, while one did a stint in the pen.
