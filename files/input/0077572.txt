[{"Title":"Okay, But Don't Watch It With It's Predecessor Back-To-Back","Date":"5 June 2000","Score":"41 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, War","Review":"  If you love the Guns Of Navarone as one of the greatest, and more importantly most literate WWII action films of all time, then this sequel is really going to cause some painful moments, and I wouldn't recommend watching the two films back-to-back under any circumstances.   Owing to the fact that it took original Guns producer Carl Foreman a decade to get the Force 10 film project off the ground, Gregory Peck and David Niven were both  Social Security eligible by the time the film was ready to go, and that meant we'd have to see a new cast.  And for the most part, despite the borrowing of footage of the first film's climax at the beginning you might as well watch this film pretending the first one never happened.   The Nicolai connection to the first film is weak and barely explored, and we probably could have done without that plotline altogether.  And whereas Guns was deadly serious in tone, filled with some rich character studies and literate exploration of the moral questions that get raised even when fighting a good cause, Force 10 is really more of an escapist war film, punctuated with moments of light comedy, and with no depth whatsoever in the characters and script.  If one is willing to accept the film on that level, then it can be enjoyed as an entertaining diversion, but no more.   It is interesting to see Harrison Ford in his first post-Star Wars role working alongside the great Robert Shaw in his last film, and Edward Fox appears to emulate most of David Niven's mannerisms quite well.   Carl Weathers though, was an annoying distraction and the scene where he demanded answers while the enemy was approaching was just plain dumb.   By it's very title though, Force 10 is always going to have the problem of it's magnificent predecessor hanging over it.  Too bad the sequel possibility wasn't cashed in on sooner when Peck, Niven and Quinn could have still done their parts (I always hoped they'd lead a new mission to rescue Anthony Quayle!)

Honestly, I think Force 10 from Navarone was more fast-paced, action-packed and hilarious as it's predecessor, The Guns of Navarone, but then, it also lacks the stronger elements that made its predecessor better. But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the opening which re-tracks the memorable final scenes from the original, FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. The cast was excellent. Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are good replacements to Gregory Peck and David Niven in the roles of Keith Mallory and Major Miller. Harrison Ford absolutely amazing as Lt. Col. Barnsby. Carl Weathers is usually out of place, but he's fine enough. While Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel offer fine performances after their roles in The Spy Who Loved Me.There will be a few hate remarks from fans of the original, but seeing it as not a sequel to the classic film and more of a film that uses 'Guns' as its inspiration, this sequel is fun, exciting and occasionally excellent.

To get there they are attached to Force 10 led by Col. Barnsby, who have their own mission to destroy a vital bridge. From the outset things go wrong, as they steal a Lancaster from an airfield in Termoli, are joined by Sgt. Weaver (escaping US MP's), then get shot down, bail out, and are captured by Chetniks who are loyal to the Germans.   By the time this sequel to 'The Guns Of Navarone' was made, 17 years had passed. Gregory Peck and David Niven were too old to reprise their roles, so Robert Shaw and Edward Fox took over. Harrison Ford, fresh from 'Star Wars', played Col. Barnsby, Franco Nero signed on as Nikolai, and Richard Kiel, Barbara Bach, and Carl Weathers all came from recent box office hits - the former two from 'The Spy Who Loved Me', the latter from 'Rocky'. Guy Hamilton was hired to direct (Goldfinger, Battle of Britain, Live and Let Die etc.)   This film has been much maligned over the years, somewhat unfairly. It could never hope to emulate its predecessor, and therefore takes a different approach. While 'Guns' had a taut, serious tone, this adopts a more tongue in cheek feel. Some of the interplay between Shaw and Fox is quite deadpan and amusing, with the actors obviously not taking proceedings too seriously. Harrison Ford looks uneasy at the start, but settles into his role as things progress. The use of the stunning Yugoslavian countryside gives the film a unique feel, and it appears to have had a decent budget. The score harks back to the type of Boys Own adventures that were so popular a decade earlier.    There are some flaws, yes. Possibly more tension could have been injected at some points, and Mallory seems to have lost the ability to speak fluent German since 'Guns'. It's not in the same league as that film or the marvellous 'Where Eagles Dare', but it's an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours on a cold, wet winters' night.

Despite some laughable special effects, and otherwise dated production value, this war movie packs a good action punch. Not many WW2 movies are set in Yugoslavia, and that's one of the interesting elements of the film. The story itself is a classic Against the Odds type affair, involving a covert Allied mission with a dual purpose. The great Robert Shaw is a standout, and a young Harrison Ford shows why he eventually became the superstar he is. Rousing music, tense action sequences, shootouts, knife fights, bombings,rescues,deceit and trickery make Force 10 a lot of fun.

Shaw, as he'd proved with JAWS and THE STING, was the contender for one of the greatest British actors ever, only Burton or Olivier have been close to that title.

However, the chemistry of all concerned is just right for this film, which involves a group of soldiers trying to blow up a bridge in Yugoslavia and the search for a traitor from the original film's mission.There are some good action sequences, and the dialogue exchanges between Ford, Edward Fox and the late Robert Shaw are passable. Carl Weathers (coming quick off ROCKY), racism issue aside, still seems out of place in the film, although he has one or two good moments.

In addition, two other Brits (Robert Shaw and Edward Fox) go along on another assignment to kill a double agent. Well, half of the team is shot down before they even reach their destination as their airplane is crippled. They are killed in air-fire or upon landing on the ground. That leaves just a small group, the above-mentioned stars of the movie plus an addition, Carl Weathers (of Rocky fame) picked up on the ground, and the double-agent (well-played by Franco Nero) who is assigned to go with them after he is cleared of charges.Anway, this re-assembled team goes on to complete their mission, or at least attempt to and are thwarted numerous times by sabotage. I won't give away the ending. Overall, a good story and definitely worth a rental and possibly a purchase. The DVD transfer was a bit grainy at first but got better as the film went along.....as the story did.

Here is a basic WWII movie that tells a very straight forward story about a small group of soldiers trying to blow up a bridge in enemy held territory.  It doesn't try to be Bridge on the River Kwai, another film where a small group of special forces travel (on foot I might add) to destroy a bridge important to the enemy forces. On the plus side is that the action takes place in Yugoslavia, not the setting of too many war movies made in Hollywood, so that gives this some interesting moments (how many movies have Croatian Chetniks in them?).  Also, Robert Shaw, good in anything, and Edward Fox have a great rapport, trading lines with impeccable timing.  It would be easy to believe they are lifelong friends in real life the way they portray their characters.  Harrison Ford gives a solid performance as a young overachieving officer, helping the subplot of the new blood clashing with the old veterans.  Barbara Bach is beautiful, but not much other reason for her to be around.  Carl Weathers actually gives a nice performance as the rebellious black soldier, implausibly brought along by weirdly improbable circumstances.  Facing the fact that the Armed Forces were segregated during WWII, it seems like the makers wanted to have a black included in the movie and had to make up some way to do that, coming up with a ridiculously contrived way to have him along.  It's unfortunate they couldn't come up with something better because, though Weathers is likable and his character brings something to the party, they way they did it undermines the plotline.The action is okay, though the payoff at the end, clever as it is, ultimately fails because of the special effects--they just weren't that well done; they seemed like they came from a grade b movie. If you've seen some WWII movies like A Bridge Too Far, Kelly's Heros, Battle of the Bulge, the Devil's Brigade, or Where Eagles Dare and liked them, definitely give this one a try.  Not a classic, but a decent addition to the crowd.

While hardly a masterpiece of cinema, Force 10 is a well-paced war adventure/buddy picture that doesn't take itself too seriously and really tries it's best to entertain the audience. It's just an awful lot of FUN.The plot concerns a mismatched group of commandos who are sent into Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia in order to kill a very elusive enemy agent and destroy a strategically vital bridge. There are lots of enjoyable plot twists and the action scenes are very well-staged. Given that this was released in 1978, the special effects are decent too.By 1970s standards, the cast is also pretty high-powered including Robert Shaw (R.I.P), a post-Han Solo Harrison Ford, Seventies uber-babe Barbara Bach, and the wonderful Edward Fox as the aristocratically eccentric explosives expert Miller (definitely my favorite character in the film). If you are looking for deep and meaningful ponderings on the nature of war and suchlike, then go someplace else. If you want a top-notch WW2 popcorn movie then you really can't do much better than this. BTW the original book by Alistair MacLean is a good read also.

Barbara Bach (The Spy Who Loved Me) is a love interest. Even Richard Kiel (Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me) is here as a heavy. Unfortunately this film is not as enjoyable as a typical Bond film not to mention equaling or surpassing the Gregory Peck classic, The Guns of Navarone, to which it is a followup. The film is not an entire waste however. A young Harrison Ford is very convincing action star even here and is almost enough to save this disappointing effort. The only really gripping part of this film was the racial tension between Keil's character and Carl Weather's (Predator) character. Average film, 6/10.

Remember, MacLean wrote Where Eagles Dare. Unfortunately, Force 10 from Navarone isn't as superlative as its source novel and many of its problems spring from the unfortunate fact that 20 years elapsed before the filmmakers brought it to get it to the screen. Force 10 features a first-rate cast with Robert Shaw taking over the Gregory Peck role, Edward Fox replacing David Niven as the explosives expert, both of whom are joined by Carl Weathers of Rocky fame, Barbara Back and Richard Kiel from the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me. The Long Ships lenser Christopher Challis captures all this larger-than-life action with his widescreen photography. Where Eagles Dare & 633 Squadron composer Rod Goodwin supplies an exhilarating as well as suspenseful orchestral score.The instant that Robert Shaw and his commandos parachute into the Balkans, the British R.A.F. Lancaster bomber that they commandeered after a hard-knuckled fist fight with M.P.s blows up. No sooner than they land behind enemy lines than they find themselves prisoners about to be shot as spies by the villainous Nazis. Only at the last possible moment do our valiant heroes triumph over well-nigh impossible odds. They confront the same perils&#151;in a sense&#151;that Hercules faced when he hacked off the Hydra's head, only to see two more heads grow back to replace the one that he'd cut off.Aside from a decapitation scene and the sadistic beating that Richard Kiel gives Barbara Bach, Force 10 from Navarone is a stylized fantasy in the superb tradition of the World War II propaganda combat movies that Errol Flynn made at Warner Brothers between 1942 and 1945. Although scores of men die, bloodletting is kept to a minimum. Take the heroes a stout bunch of lads with clenched jaws and uncompromising virtue. Or the villains a ruthless pack of devils that outnumber the good guys 100 to one. Nevertheless, despite the suicidal odds, our resourceful heroes carry out their mission, but not without considerable trouble. Sadly, Alistair MacLean's thrilling novel loses much of its panache in Robin Chapman's script. While Chapman's script keeps most of the plot intact (yes, they destroy a bridge by blasting a dam to smithereens), he has rewritten many scenes, eliminated several important characters, and added some&#151;like Carl Weather's African-American sergeant.Director Guy Hamilton encores explosive footage from director J. Lee Thompson's The Guns of Navarone to remind us that Force 10 qualifies as a sequel. The movie opens with a map to establish the geography of the setting accompanied by stirring narration Deep in the heart of the Aegean Sea lies the island of Navarone. In 1943, it stood poised like a knife in the Allies' side. Hamilton keeps the action crackling and never allows the clutter of the plot&#151;Major Keith Mallory (Shaw) and Corporal Dusty Miller (Fox) must identify a traitor as well as help out Lieutenant Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford of Star Wars) and his survivor blow up the bridge. In the book, Mallory and Miller were sent in to destroy the bridge and there was no Lt. Colonel Barnsby.To his credit, Hamilton has enlisted a persuasive cast, convincing special effects, and the actual setting of the action scenic Yugoslavia. In his last role, Robert Shaw gives a hearty performance as Mallory. Edward Fox is simply delightful as the 'vetty' British explosives expert. When he observes the bridge that Barnsby has been sent to blow up, he observes that the force of the charges won't seriously inconvenience the Nazis.Force 10 from Navarone is a seriously underrated World War II feature film.

Director Guy Hamilton uses a clip from his earlier film Battle of England when the Messerschmitt attacks the Lancaster bomber and the so-called German Panzer tanks shown at the end of the movie are actually Soviet T-34s - a medium tank produced from 1940 to 1958 . The screenplay has eloquent dialogue , humor , double-crosses , continuous tension and surprising twists that keep the viewer's attention . Sweeping wartime movie epic from the director of 'James Bond's Goldfinger' presents the historic events of hokey manner but it does so fascinatingly . All in all,it's a successful piece of warlike fluff. Although overlong ,has good battle footage , solid acting , breathtaking scenes which help offset a sometimes far-fetched plot, but suffers on television , as the small screen damages its really spectacular images. The soundtrack by French composer Maurice Jarre , Jean Michel Jarre's father , is full of vibrant sound , brings a solemn score, cutting edge, played by an orchestra of wind .

He wrote many best-selling action novels that were turned into often successful movies. When asked to comment on why his stories were so popular he remarked that he always wrote stories that were visual. Since they were easy to imagine when the books were read, they were easy to film . This flick is one of several movies based on an Alistair MacLean novels set in rugged battles during WWII , the first was ¨ Guns of Navarone¨ , after that , it would be ¨ When eagles dare¨ by Brian H Hutton .

They are initially captured by Yugoslav partisans and turned over to the Nazis. Another partisan group working with the allies rescues them and things go on from there.

While Malory couldn't dismiss his admiration for Leskovar it was tempered by only by his ill will for Leskovar (Franco Nero). At this time of the war Germany's infrastructure was still in tact. As it was LT. Barnsby (Harrison Ford) was interested only on his commands directive despite the odds. Leskovar was able to portray the subtle magnificence that Germany possessed. Although surrounded and outnumbered he stood fast to duty and was unmoved by any peripheral motivations of Malory to stop him. Conversely it was this same menacing quality that was greatly misunderstood and undermined by a bewildered British Parliament.The remarkable leadership (Malory) portrayed the way this special forces groups and were able to maneuver weaving through the German forces. This was the brilliance Guy Hamilton(director)captured in was in direct juxtaposition of what the Wehrmacht were going through in this film circa 1942-43; everything seemed quite routine propagandized as if this part of the war was just a larger part of the endgame. This was the climate of the time you could feel the condensing push of allied forces tightening there grip by blowing this bridge would cause a bilge in the German forces creating a forced hemorrhage within Army group.The unsettling dampness of Unasylva Forest woven through slumbering Corsican pines that elbowed there way over an uneven earth plump with unforgiving terrains that would of allied the Axis at this time. This late Autumn feeling emanated throughout the film the precipice of change was completely missed on the critics. So as the Wehrmacht regrouped amongst the Bridge head and silver firs that spiked curving bridgehead the terrain helped to sustain the Wehrmachts march. It felt as if you were in the EAST in 1942-43 when hope for Germany was still a plausible horizon. So it was the death of Leskovar that represented the turning point as the rise of the American Hero significantly allowed for Britain's role to be inwardly reserved albeit an antinomical position. And the advent of any resistance was carried out with an seemingly all do or die attitude. This translates through the film and resonates better than any other war film I have seen on this topic. Because it dealt with precisely the indifference of war while other battles were being fought. The a cataclysmic battle of wills and what one side was willing to do on every level, and even this highlighted in the railway car where Leskovar had attempted to stop the saboteurs and forbade the plans of Barnsby and Malory. This was a polarizing moment when all could of been won or lost. Why had Leskovar gotten back on the train car he had to of known by then he would be found out. He might of ordered another division to shoot the train-car and warned the bridge ahead. These are the speculative questions of war the in this film I feel are overlooked by some, this film is magnificently real and I feel people wanted a more Hollywood feel.Then at last the fuses to be lit (Miller) Barnaby and Malory are anxious to boggle the whole deal and get caught but again the weight of German Tanks are again their undoing, the symbolism in this film are uncanny. Even if they weren't the real Tigers or Panzer corps.The Tigers albeit monster were unsuited for most every terrain and battlefield in which they fought. This magnifies advanced thought process but also the egotism that over thought, and fought useless battles one after the next. And the greatest battle was with the weather while this film brings this into the perfect backdrop. All the while the useless battles of division and armored divisions raged on that would of been better suited and served in the greater offensive or defense that Germany was later faced with. And the long stem irony of this film that one bridge destroyed could of ended the war.But this underscores the greater example of symbolism in this film. Perhaps an ethereal bridge of atonement might of better explained that in the end it was the bridge of communication that was that would need to be crossed time and time again. This is why the balance of leadership must be one voice restrained by reason and when these lines are broken or intercepted it is hard to sustain any chain of command. And so the Force 10 from Navarone's The guns of Navarone are left for the Victorious ones and their books of fiction. Humanity and the historical texts that in reality written as revisionist history books well we can see what we have done with that history of humanity.

In the Book Captain Keith Mallory his friend and Partner Colonel Andrea Stavros and Corp. Dusty Miller are all that's left of the Guns Strike force. and almost right off the bat are given another assignment. That assignment was the book Force Ten from Navarone. the story was There is a bridge. The Germans are going to cross it blow it up. There is also a traitor who almost dismantled the Guns mission find him kill him. Along the way they get help from Colonel Barnsby and his commandoes to destroy the bridge.The Movie differs in some regards Where Alistair Maclean intended for Mallory and Stavros and Miller to be the original hard luck heroes As soon as they finished one mission they get hit with another. When the original Guns was released in 61 There was no sequel and the film makers had to talk Maclean into writing one. what he came up with was Force ten. It took a long time for Force ten to be made and in 1978 they did it. Instead of Peck we Got Robert Shaw. Shaw does a good job as Mallory and instead of Niven we got Fox as Miller . Fox is a decent actor but as Miller he is in over his head. And last instead of Anthony Quinn we get newly minted Star Harrison Ford fresh off of Star Wars playing Colonel Barnsby. For some reason Stavros never shows up. And we got Eye Candy in Barbra Bach a decent actress whose beautiful looks enhanced her acting . In the Supporting cast we get Carl Weathers fresh from Rocky playing a Sgt. The roles are played very well or as best as they are able. Only Shaw and Ford carry off their roles with authority and make the roles their own. Fox is the exception. While Watchable he pales beside Niven's portrayal. And Fox does a good job but you can see him channeling David Niven.The Scene of the Dam and the Bridge remain spectacular even after all these years . Guy Hamilton's direction is crisp and sharp. and he rarely mis steps .Force Ten from Navarone is in my opinion a worthy follow up to-the classic Guns of Navarone. And since a new author took over the Navarone series maybe just maybe we should not wait so long between movies to continue the story of Captain Keith Mallory and his hard luck heroes .

After the successful raid in 'The Guns of Navarone', Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant Miller (Edward Fox) are back in England given a mission to kill Nicolai in Yugoslavia. They thought he was executed during Navarone but was actually a German spy. They are the only ones who can identify the spy who is suspected of infiltrating the partisans. They are joined by American unit Force 10 led by Colonel Barnsby (Harrison Ford). American MP Weaver (Carl Weathers) is swept up in the operation. After getting shot down, they encounter local fighters led by Maritza (Barbara Bach) and Drazak (Richard Kiel).There are a few too many unnecessary twists and turns. It would be more compelling to concentrate on Nicolai and the eventual mission. Weaver could have been in Force 10 instead of the complicated way that he gets roped in. Also being captured early on creates two problems. It splits the group in two and it requires convoluted escapes. At its core, there is an interesting war thriller. I just think the group needs to stay together.

It's that it attempted to be seen as the sequel to The Guns Of Navarone. The Guns Of Navarone boasted Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, and Anthony Quayle...a tough act to follow. And this film just didn't...follow that tough act. The cast here is good, but Robert Shaw is not Gregory Peck, and Harrison Ford (at this stage in his career) was no Anthony Quinn or David Niven. And, while this is a decent story, it can't compare toe the complexity of The Guns Of Navarone. It would almost be like comparing an A movie with a B movie, although I won't be that harsh.Robert Shaw played Robert Shaw in this film. That's not necessarily bad, but I've rarely found Shaw's performances to be very deep. To me he was a flash in the pan propelled by a handful of top notch films including Jaws. Edward Fox is one of my favorite older British actors, but regrettably, he didn't have a lot to do in this film. A great talent wasted. Harrison Ford, fairly fresh off his first really big pic -- Star Wars, does okay, but he hadn't really developed a very mature acting style as yet (and just to be clear, eventually he became one of my favorites). Barbara Bach...eh. Franco Nero is interesting here.I was appalled by the role given to Carl Weathers. I guess since it was 1978 there had to be some racist bullcrap here...and this role provided it. Weathers was a pretty decent actor. Too bad he accepted a role like this. More than any other one aspect, this is where the crass aspect came in.There's other crassness here, too, though. The score is less than inspired. The story itself is decent, but there is some immaturity here. Guy Hamilton, the director, is best known for some classy James Bond films, but he had less success in other endeavors...including this one. And by the way, if the bridge is do damned important, why wouldn't they just bomb it from the air? Yes, the film has some good moments and some good action sequences -- particularly later in the film --...but nothing that sets it apart from dozens and dozens of other war films.I should, by my own standards, give this film a 7, but since it tried to win an audience off the fame of The Guns Of Navarone, when in reality it had nothing to do with that film, I'm dropping it down to a 6. And yes, I know it was the same author. But he didn't insert scenes directly from the original film into the first few minutes of this film. That's crass.

I was even enjoying this as much as the original Guns of Navarone, that is, until the plot holes popped up (the original also had plot holes). This is not a dumb action movie that begs you to switch off your brain, so the plot holes pretty much ruin the experience. It turns out the whole plot was very significantly changed from the book though so keep that in mind.*spoilers* - The biggest plot hole is the fact they were sent there because they knew Nikolai and could identify him and they knew Nikolai was at least a traitor from personal experience. So when they met him, why would they believe the story about another Nikolai that was the real traitor/spy? - Another hole is that it turns out the British were constantly in touch with the partisans so they didn't have to send commandos to kill Nikolai, they could have simply told them to kill him.- And then there is the whole bluff with the penicillin. First they bluff that they have it in their suitcase but they can't open it, then when it turns out it has wood inside the case, they say they buried it. Any German with half a brain would see the contradiction in the story. If they buried it for that matter, why bring the suitcase at all knowing that the Germans would force them to open it? - Also the masked infiltrators were obviously discovered dead by the partisans first since they knew about it when they nabbed Force 10, so why did they leave the dead bodies there to be discovered by the Chetniks and thus give themselves away? - Why would Miller instruct them how to plant the bomb at the dam, but not tell them the critical information that it would be a slow destruction and thus let them know how to time the whole thing so that they could get away and not allow the bomb to be discovered?- I also had a problem with the fact that simple explosives could not destroy the bridge but water could. But this may be a lack of engineering knowledge on my part and perhaps the water eroded the ground underneath, except that he was going on and on about how it was attached to rock so I have doubts... Also the effects, although very well done, did not show an overwhelming force of water against the bridge that would convince. But, again, it may just be my lack of knowledge here.Pity, because I enjoyed the rest.

As was par for the course at the time a lot of effort is made to bring in foreign audiences by casting European stars, but Franco Nero is largely wasted in an unfortunately obvious role with only one tense scene of note.It's funny to see James Bond alums Richard Kiel (best known as Jaws in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER) and Barbara Bach together again as Chetniks vs. Spielberg/Lucas protégés Harrison Ford and Robert Shaw (JAWS - the movie) in what is essentially a glorified B war movie only marginally glossier than what Italy and Yugoslavia were pumping out a decade prior.Unfortunately there's a lot of missed opportunities and bad logic which takes this movie down several notches. The Germans are of course portrayed as utterly stupid and are easily bamboozled so many times that they're rendered utterly nonthreatening by the film's end. Carl Weathers provides probably the most likable and 3-dimensional of all the characters in the film but his presence doesn't really make much sense or add anything aside from some comedic moments with Richard Kiel, who takes an instant dislike to him. Harrison Ford sleepwalks his way through the film and Robert Shaw looks and acts as exhausted as he probably was at this time so near to the end of his life.As par for the course there's plenty of explosions and gun-play but unfortunately quite wasted in a largely daft and sloppily made film.Look fast for Doctor Who actors Michael Sheard (later reunited with Ford as Hitler in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE) and Leslie Schofield (the guy in STAR WARS who tells Peter Cushing that There is a danger) in bit parts as German soldiers. Also don't blink or you'll miss some nudity courtesy of Ms. Bach only two years prior to her marriage to Ringo Starr. Also strange is how Robert Rietty (who provided Adolfo Celi's dubbed voice in THUNDERBALL and Tetsuro Tamba's in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) here lends his dubbing over Bond villain Richard Kiel!

It's another men on a mission movie that sees the guys en-route to blow up a dam in Second World War Yugoslavia. Cue a spy in the ranks who needs fleshing out, scrapes and tribulations involving partisans and inevitable capture, and the presence of Weathers' Sergeant Weaver gives the story a whole bunch of racial tension. Sadly suspense is very much lacking within the two hour running time, director Hamilton (probably under orders) just stringing the plot along in undemanding fashion. There's the usual quota of machismo, although Barbara Bach's token female interest tries to lower the testosterone levels, and Goodwin's brisk militarised score is pleasant enough. Cast performances are credible, with Fox the most watchable, and real Yugoslavian location usage is truly a plus point.Not awful, just hackneyed and instantly forgettable.

There are exceptions to his general rule (A Bridge Too Far, Saving Private Ryan), but you can usually be sure that if a war film was made later than this he won't have much time for it. By the late 1970s old-fashioned heroics were given short shrift in the movies, with heroism seemingly going hand-in-hand with nostalgia in 'old boys' reunion' films like The Wild Geese and The Sea Wolves. Force 10 From Navarone doesn't quite fit this mould (its leading men aren't quite of pensionable age), but this somehow renders it even more silly and out of step with the times than the other films mentioned. Compared to the earlier, big-budget Alistair MacLean adventures The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare, this adaptation of one of his novels looks visibly impoverished, despite its A-picture status. The performances are variable, with Robert Shaw (in his last completed film) and Edward Fox reprising the Gregory Peck and David Niven roles from the earlier film to little effect; they totally miss the danger of Peck and Niven's gritty commandos and seem to be playing the film largely for laughs (Shaw even calls Fox a 'little perisher' at one point). Meanwhile, Harrison Ford, in his first starring role post-Star Wars, plays the clean-cut American Colonel as a sub-John Wayne jawbones and turns in probably his most forgettable lead performance. The Spy Who Loved Me's Barbara Bach turns up to flash some flesh in a totally gratuitous 'bit of blue for the Dads' bath scene, whilst the entire part of the annoying character played by Rocky's Carl Weathers could have been cut without altering the plot of the film at all. The movie is incredibly dull, with a weak script, badly edited action scenes, and a surprising amount of very poorly post-synched dialogue, not to mention the disconcerting sight of actors familiar from Children's BBC turning up as German soldiers (say hello, Mr Bronson from Grange Hill, and Jonny Briggs' Dad). Even Jaws himself, Richard Kiel, puts in an appearance as yet another hulking villain, though his role is plainly dubbed. Considering the fact that this movie is directed by Guy 'Goldfinger' Hamilton, it's a massive disappointment, a weary, unexciting watch that wastes a very good cast.

Or on a pair of them.This time they're joined by Americans Harrison Ford and Carl Weathers on the team. And the boys have two missions to accomplish. Ford and Weathers have to get a bridge blown up so the Germans can't move heavy concentrations of troops. Colonel Alan Badel of the partisans has some limited forces at his disposal to stop them if they don't. But there's also an agent in the partisan camp and that's Shaw's job, to kill the traitor.If you remember The Guns Of Navarone best try and put it out of your mind because this film isn't nearly as good. If you remember that film, Gregory Peck's character was that of a mountain climber and his part in that mission was to get that team up the steep face of a cliff where the Germans wouldn't be looking. He was not a trained assassin as Shaw is. But I'm guessing the screenplay authors forgot that little detail when they wrote this film.The Sixties and Seventies were the decade when black players began to get all kinds of roles and stopped being in the stereotyped parts that they had been relegated to before. In fact though in some cases they were shoehorned into situations that just wouldn't have applied. Such is the case for Carl Weathers who there is no way a black man would have been on this kind of mission back in the day. The Armed Forces weren't even integrated until after World War II. But the script went through all kind of hoops to make sure Weathers was kept well hidden while the rest of the team blended with the surroundings.But beyond that Force 10 From Navarone resembles one of those propagandistic films from the World War II era where the Nazis were often played as incredibly stupid. It most resembles that Errol Flynn action film Desperate Journey, one of the dumber A films to come out from that era. Harrison Ford was fresh from his breakthrough starring role as Han Solo in Star Wars and I guess this was kind of training for his later Indiana Jones films. But Force 10 From Navarone doesn't have the color and élan of any Indiana Jones pulp film. The force was not with this movie.

MacLean quickly realized the profit to be had in the movies and many of his later novels read like film treatments, ready-made for the cinema. And many MacLean stories were made into movies like Breakheart Pass, Where Eagles Dare, and this sequel to Guns of Navarone, Force 10 From Navarone. Quinn's character (prominent in the book) is discarded, as is most of MacLean's taut story. Peck and Niven being either too old (or too smart) to reprise their roles, Robert Shaw and Edward Fox replaced them. More on them later.On paper, it looks promising. Alistair MacLean story adapted by Carl Forman (who wrote Guns of Navarone); a James Bond director; a cast with veterans Shaw and Fox aided by several hot young properties, including Harrison Ford, Barbara Bach and Carl Weathers. But the whole was never as much as the sum of its parts.The movie is poorly-directed. The pacing is plodding. A power-fight is set up at the beginning between Shaw's character and Ford's that dissolves too early. They each have their own mission but take their time getting around to them. The script is poorly written with a lot of cheesy dialog. With Shaw, Ford, Fox and the other name actors in the cast, the viewer has a sense from the start that unknown members of the mission will meet the fate of crew members you've never seen before in Star Trek who accompany Kirk, Spock and Bones on a visit to a possibly hostile new planet. But there is hope. Harrison Ford, who acts with his eyes more than by inflection in speaking, looks like he realizes, too late, he's chosen the wrong property to further his career after Star Wars and he wants the whole thing over, but this does provide the look of a man in a suspenseful situation. The best thing about the movie is that British actors of the old school take their jobs seriously. Shaw may realize he's talking rubbish, but he acts like he believes that rubbish. Fox brings a stiff-upper-lip insouciance to his role that makes it even more fun than Niven in Navarone. Fox, the major comic relief, doesn't have big laughs, but in this movie you're grateful for every small favor. Nero, while not British, also does a fine job, and his role provides the movie's major suspense. And, poor though it is, the script does manage a twist or two you don't see coming.Though it's overall a lifeless movie whose few scattered superb parts don't make it worthwhile for the average movie-goer, fans of the actors or of Alistair MacLean will want to see it, just to complete their collection.

This same technique was used much more successfully to represent parked B -17s in Memphis Belle and Horsa gliders in A Bridge Too Far. In Force 10 From Navarone this technique is used very badly. Then we see a mock up of a Lancaster interior done in the studio,some stock monochrome footage from The Dambusters,some real air-to-air footage of the RAF's airworthy Lancaster and then some model work.The whole sequence is very unconvincing and looks like the effects in a 1950s movie. In any case Lancasters were never flown from Italian bases (as far as I am aware).And it is rather unlikely that Harrison Ford's character - an army colonel - would be able to fly a Lancaster without prior special training. The producers should really have substituted another aircraft type such as the Dakota and then done it for real.Interestingly the worst part of the original Guns of Navarone was the opening sequence involving model Lancasters - again inaccurate because Lancasters were never flown against targets in Greece.Force 10 From Navarone is pretty good apart from this one sequence. It was also the last big war movie scored by Ron Goodwin ,who dies in 2003.

The story in brief Mallory and Miller, the survivors of Navarone, are to locate a German agent and terminate him with extreme prejudice. (Translation KILL HIM!) How they do that is quite simple. Or is it? They have to blow a dam with dynamite. Barbara Bach, the future Mrs. Ringo Starr, is the token eye candy. She plays a Yugoslavian Partisan. Robert Shaw, (in his last film,) plays Major Miller. Harrison Ford, a year after Star Wars, and three years before Raiders Of The Lost Ark, is Lieutenant Colonel Mike Barnsby. Carl Weathers is Sergeant Weaver, the token black on the mission. The movie is the sequel to The Guns of Navarone. This, unfortunately, was the last movie based on Alistair MacLean novel, because Alistair MacLean died in 1984. I used to read Alistair MacLean's novels all the time when I was young.

That little piece of trivia is really about the only thing that stands out in this forgettable and pointless 70's WW2 action piece.Supposedly a continuation of the Guns of Navarone story, but aside from the characters portrayed in that film by Gregory Peck, David Niven (and Richard Harris?), the link to the 1962 J. Lee Thompson film is in name only. And shamelessly so, as this film could never have survived 3 days at the box office without having 'Navarone' in its title.Some very questionable and implausible plot devices drive this lacklustre adventure; by the time Ford and Robert Shaw kill the two Chetniks in the facial bandages you know for sure you're watching a bad film, which doesn't get remotely suspenseful or interesting until Shaw and Ford attempt to blow up the dam at the end.Acting wise? Harrison Ford is competent as Barnsby. Shaw is coasting as Mallory, Edward Fox is flip and annoying as Miller, and Carl Weathers is hopelessly out of place, as well as unneeded, as Weaver. Richard Kiel, in what little screen time he's given, memorably chews the Yugoslav countryside in an over the top turn as the evil gargantuan Chetnik Captain. Barbara Bach provides the shallow cheesecake, and Franco Nero fools no one (as much as the screenwriters tried to twist and drag it out over two and a half acts) as the double agent Shaw is attached to the mission to assassinate.All in all it's one of the thinnest as well as being one of the last WW2 commandos on a mission movies. Some majestic locations and the odd good line, and Harrison Ford's post Star Wars presence aren't enough to save it. Watchable once to pass the time but nothing you'd want to add to your DVD collection.

Irregardless of that, the movie in question is one of the most underrated World War 2 films ever made. Under the expert hand of Guy (Goldfinger) Hamilton the plot takes a group of commando's led by Harrison Ford (fresh off the success of Star Wars) off to Yugoslavia. In tow they have Robert (Jaws) Shaw and Edward (Day of the Jackal) Fox who have a mission of their own and a stowaway in the shape of Carl (Rocky) Weathers.Upon arrival in Yugoslavia they are met by a group of characters that include Bach and another 007 alum Richard Kiel, and the viewer is left trying to guess who is friend and who is foe.

These 'specialists' are nothing of the kind and seem to belong to a movie like Stripes or Police Academy.

They join up with another military unit called Force 10 who have their own orders.  However in Yugoslavia Force 10 loses most of their men and the group is captured by the Germans.  Mallory and Barnsby escape and join with their allies the Partisans and a plan to formed to take out the bridge that the Germans plan to use to bring tanks across to cross the Partisan troops.  The first obstacle however is to rescue explosives expert Miller from the Germans.Some 17 years later a sequel is made for Guns of Navarone and the modern values show in the production from scene one onwards.  The actual plot is good, as you'd expect from McClane, he always was good at the `boys own' mystery stuff.  However the problem here is the delivery of the material &#150; it's not as polished or as exciting as you'd hope for.  Instead it plods when it should grip and jogs when it should sprint.  The director knows he has a good story and seems content to slowly let it do the work itself without adding flair of his own.  As a result the minor plot twists (although not surprising) are non-events and barely registered with me.  When I read the books the thing I loved was the fact that you'd be caught in Mallory's web of stories as well, however here you never doubt what's going on.The action scenes are also the same.  A knife fight is dull and colourless and the war footage is also low-key &#150; even the finale is minor compared to the force of nature contained in the book.  However this was not loved as a production.  It feels cobbled together and relying on star power to get crowds in.  As a result the ending is significantly changed from the book to satisfy the American stars.But are the yanks the stars &#150; no.  Mallory and Miller are the main roles but naturally the pair who did them so well aren't back (too old or not interested).  Shaw struggles to make the role his own and feels ill at ease &#150; but he is following Gregory Peck after all.  Miller was great when played by David Niven and Edward Fox almost pulls it off, but not quite.  Ford is wooden and Weathers is too angry and race-obsessed to fit with the spirit of the movie.  Dare I suggest that Weathers was added to get the black buck?  Nero (Django) is good in a small role and the bond connection is made by Bach and Kiel &#150; both were in the Spy who Loved Me.Guns of Navarone wasn't a classic but it was a polished film that felt that some effort had gone into it.  By contrast this feels like it lacks energy and that not too much effort was made in the production apart from getting some big names on board.  The whole thing just feels like mass produced fast food &#150; it's not bad, it's just tastes the same as everything else.

That was almost as bizarre as the producers handily dropping the Navarone name into the title trying to catch a wave from 17 years ago in a film which has nothing to do with the earlier location.Once you get past that and accept that Harrison Ford has to be the youngest US Army colonel ever conscripted this is an enjoyable old-fashioned war movie although it does seem as if it belongs to another era of movie-making completely. Thus we get the usual Alistair MacLean ingredients of reluctant male-bonding, another traitor in the midst, for no apparent reason at all, a beautiful woman in a central part and of course, a big destructive finish.Shame that the would-be blockbuster finish is so obviously based on model-work but I guess SFX at the times had still to leap to the C-Gen stage. The characterisation is pretty much as you'd expect with the Germans portrayed as stupid and heartless, their partisan collaborators as heartless and stupid, with all the brains, courage and teamwork coming from Mallory and his cell. I could however have done without the racial baiting of Carl Weathers' black maverick soldier, quite unnecessary and unforgivable in a film made in the late 70's.The acting is as solid and stolid as you'd expect, Shaw and Fox demonstrating a stiff upper lip and Ford trademarking American moxy as they all start off distrusting each other but of course wind up as bonded-by-fire buddies by the end.It's fair to say I think that MacLean's writing and movie direction of this style was looking very clichéd and anachronistic this far down the line. That said, I'm a pretty old-fashioned type of guy and even though I found the characters stereotyped and the plotting unoriginal, I still got some sort of enjoyment from watching it.

To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with Force 10, an American unit, led by Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby (Ford), which has its own mission there.With a few exceptions all the cast are fine. Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from Rocky) is solid. Myy favourite Bond girl Barbara Bach is as good as I've seen her (admittedly I've only seen her in a couple of movies.

Richard Keil (Jaws from James Bond) does his usual bad guy routine and Michael Byrne is his reliable self as is Edward Fox.It is not without its problems, some of the fight scenes are awfully staged, and their is obvious use of miniatures.

The latter is such a tiresome Hollywood pose that it might serve to explain why they always seem intent on demonstrating how America actually won the war. The British just saw it as a jolly game.This movie so blatantly trades upon the original 1960's classic that 'rip-off' is almost an understatement. But it's not the only one. We had the pukerific 'Mosquito Squadron' composed largely of out-takes from '633 Squadron' and 'The Dambusters', not to mention 'Return From The River Kwai', which had nothing to do with the River Kwai', but which - like this crap - simply traded on the name.If this movie had been simply called 'Force 10', it would have drawn the kind of indifferent response it deserved; but by grafting on 'From Navarone', it probably got twice as many bums on seats at its release.Disengaged from its pretensions; there is the substance of a decent wartime thriller here. The cast, plot, and dramatic interludes are all formulaic, but that doesn't necessarily mean dull. There's some interesting location stuff - especially within the bowels of the dam - which look well thought-out and convincing. It's just that the directorial pacing is so pedestrian, things seem to be happening at almost half-speed. That, plus the mediocre script and uninvolving characters, reduce it to a very ordinary set-piece movie. I'd like to say 'thriller', but it was just too slow. I've seen sharper documentaries. A good 30mins could have been shaved off without detriment.Worth a first watch if you haven't seen it, but not recommended; and certainly not collectible. Five to six stars is about right.

Can't say much about Peck's German since I don't speak any German myself, but it does sound a bit wooden. But why didn't Mallory speak English like an Englishman? On top of that Peck's dramatic scene's reminded me of William Shatner's acting style.Force 10 from Navarone isn't quite the piece of art Guns was. As many had said before, Carl Weathers' character was completely out of place here and many other things were wrong.But the one thing I would like to point out is that what many consider a blooper really isn't one. Mallory still suspects the Nero character of being the traitor they thought he was, long after the Nero character was supposedly cleared. Only Miller knew Mallory spoke German like a German! So when the Nero character proposes to join them because they don't speak German, Mallory keeps his mouth shut about being able to speak German so he can keep an eye on Nero's character. You know, keep your friends close but keep your enemies even closer. It was the logical thing to do. It was what I would have done.Shaw was the only thing in this movie that was better than Guns.

Probably only his most devout fans could. That's the trouble with Force 10 from Navarone. It seems to have all of the right ingredients including a great cast, beautiful locations, a rousing score, and that ever-dependable villain the Nazis. However once it ends, you likely won't remember many details other than the destruction of an enormous dam and bridge in the final moments. What went wrong? First off it must be pointed out that this film is reputed to be a sequel to Guns of Navarone which was released several years prior. I must confess to having never seen much of that film, yet several informed accounts point out that this film has very little in common with its predecessor other than the word Navarone in the title. That is not the only problem; in fact had the film been written better, it might have hardly mattered at all. Force 10 is unfocused to say the least. We have an elite team of American special forces ready to embark on a mission into Yugoslavia. Harrison Ford is their leader, and their mission is to blow up a bridge. Added to the mission at the last moment are two Englishmen. One is an explosives expert who doesn't even seem to know that he will be used for the demolition. Another (Shaw) is along for the ride to kill a double agent who is operating amongst the Pro-Allied Partisan force near the bridge. Only about half-way through does it seem to become clear that everyone is on the right page and understands what they're all supposed to be doing. Even then, there are double-crossings going on nearly up until the very end.Some of the action is compelling. Some of the situations these operatives find themselves in are ludicrous. The acting is uniformly very good. You can tell Harrison Ford already knows he's a star. Shaw is great, too. Franco Nero as a Partisan leader shows some talent, and Barbra Bach is a real treat for the eyes. The pacing is poor, and some of the dialog is absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel. Despite the PG rating, there are some adult-like surprises. Bach is topless in one scene (yes!), and there is a very graphic decapitation of a hapless Nazi soldier.In sum, this film won't put you to sleep, but with all involved it should have been better.

Alas, the same cannot be said of this critically-mauled all-star film sequel. A disappointing slice of wartime escapism, it opts for a totally unsuitable jokey tone which nullifies the suspense. Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Miller (Edward Fox) are relaxing in a convalesence hospital after their recent successful mission to destroy the Guns of Navarone. They are called upon to return to the battle front in Yugoslavia, where the Partizan forces are suffering heavy losses due to a traitor in their midst. An American team headed by Captain Barnes (Harrison Ford) is also sent along. Once in Yugoslavia, Mallory's team set about contacting the Partizans and unearthing the treacherous spy among their number. They also learn that a massive invasion is imminent from the German side of the River Neretva, and the only way to stop it is by sabotaging a dam further upriver (the idea being that the sudden blast of flood water will wash away a bridge vital to the German attack). It's certainly a busy plot, and a potentially interesting one at that. But the film fails to capitalise on it. Instead, the script meanders along aimlessly, pitching the heroes from one far-fetched danger to another. Despite the enormous wealth of acting talent on show, most performances come across as lazy and jaded. The original Alistair MacLean novel is all but rejected in favour of clumsy action sequences and heavy-handed touches of humour and irony. Ford in particular looks like he would be more comfortable at the controls of the Millenium Falcon, but even the usually-dependable Shaw seems to be performing at half-the-normal-effort. A regrettable flop, this one, quite unworthy of the tremendous novel on which it is based.

The plot contains awful inconsistencies and improbable, stupid sequences. Here are the major ones1. When Weaver gets on the plane the team fails to report that to the leader. This is contrary to what a well-trained soldier would have done. (And Weaver would probably have been thrown out of the plane instantly as a danger to the mission.) 2. A team of carefully chosen specialists were totally wrong about the chances of blowing up the bridge. It's unbelievable how dumb those Yankees are! Luckily enough a smart fellow (Miller) comes up with a brilliant solution within a twenty-minutes inspection, those smart asses in HQ weren't able to invent in days. 3. Weaver has an interesting conversation with his leader about his emotional life just as the enemy is drawing near - very near. Then he isn't punished in any way. (Would have been shot normally). 4.Mallory knows all the time that Leskovar is a traitor but he lets him come along on a mission to a German base where it would be easiest for him to give the team away. 5. Miller does not tell his companions how the dam explosives are supposed to work. As a result they nearly blow themselves up, but somehow manage to escape and then just have a good laugh (no grievances whatsoever).That T-34s act as German tanks (Pazer IVs? Panthers?) is in this context just a minor source of hilarity.

The plot?  Harrison Ford and Robert Shaw are assigned to blow up a bridge in Nazi territory.  Along for the ride is Carl Weathers, who has a hilariously awful fight scene with Richard Kiel. Barbara Bach is here, too, though her presence is ultimately wasted and severely underused.The only thing this movie has going for it is Harrison Ford, three years before he'd become one of Hollywood's biggest superstars.  Here, he shows his natural charisma and well-tuned sense of humor.  It's always a lot of fun to watch this guy on-screen, he's never delivered a bad performance and this is no exception.  But come on, if you really want to see Harry Ford take on dastardly Nazis, you'd be far better off watching (or re-watching) Raiders of the Lost Ark or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the two finest action films in existence.

Like building bridges perhaps. The film takes a while to get going and even when it does go, it's all sputter and smoke. Now, if you like to see people blow up sh*t  (Doctor in G.I. Jane) then you can just fast forward to the last 15 minutes of the film and (for its time) watch a half decent demolition. But holy smoke! Yak yak yak all the way through the first part of the film. I don't recall more walking and talking and wasted space than this has. This is not a bad film its just labored and full of dialog that doesn't really add any value. Dialog from my experience with film seems to flow under two types of bridge. That which substitutes for visual content, and that which draws additional images, in the mind of the viewer, enriching the visual content of the film. The former is used by and large in low budget productions where there isn't enough money or time to film what should be captured on film. You can spot them almost immediately. If this gets your interest, then try it for yourself. For example, rent both Force 10 and Battle of Britain (1969) (same director), then watch Force 10 first and then the Battle of Britain then Force 10 again. It is not that the film is older, that is no excuse for less than expected results. A-B-C these for example - The Longest Day (1962) Directed by Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton, A Bridge Too Far (1977) Directed by Richard Attenborough and Saving Private Ryan (1998) Directed by Steven Spielberg  The age of a film has no impact on the viewers' enjoyment of it. That is just techno-snobbery. But I digress.I was simply galled by the number of lost opportunities for greatness in this film. The plot involves two separate possibly conflicting missions in one journey. Sounds good so far right? The front mission populated by young men itching to get at it, and two older less enthusiastic hitchhikers with their own separate mission and neither allowed to disclose the contents of the others' mission. Getting better all the time eh? This is the stuff of classics. Now add to that, a naked young woman in a bathtub, a dollop or two of treachery and double treachery, seven cups of multiple ethnic, political and religious groups fighting for different causes in the same campaign, and two large man made structures dividing the two main groups of the campaign, and you have subject matter worthy of an Epic. At least this is what I was expecting. HA! Yak yak yak. Walk walk walk.

This is one of the films on my favorites list. They just don't make them like this anymore. (Only the upcoming U-571 looks like it comes close) The story is the tale of a American mission into Yugoslavia to destroy a bridge before German troops can cross it, to destroy Yugoslav forces under Marshall Tito. However, the mission is blown by a sinister spy, the plane and equipment are destroyed, and it looks as if all is lost. The new target of the mission becomes a dam. With the dam destroyed the force of the cascading water will destroy the bridge the germans are trying to take. This film was based on a novel by ALISTAR MCLEAN and was the sequel to the GUNS OF NAVARRONE. The film was filmed on location in communist Yugoslavia. Among the cast were CARL WEATHERS, RICHARD KIEL, FRANCO NERO, and the beautiful BARBARA BACH. I wish Hollywood would crank out a few more like this, however, I doubt it. They seem to be out of touch with what the rest of the nation wants and continue to crank out drek like HOME FRIES.

The plot is pure nonsense and - except of the title credits - the movie has nothing to to with the first quite brilliant NAVARONE movie.The story is about a force to break down a bridge which they want to do by blasting a dam. But it takes some time and the viewer's patience because there happens nothing quite serious. We see Barbara Bach getting out of her bath showing her breasts; we also see Richard Kiel, the jaws from two James Bond movies, which were actual at this time. These cameo appearances are followed by a ridiculous escape (they cut of a Nazi soldier's head with a tightened wire) and a B-picture run for some dynamite. At last they finally bunch down the bridge which reveals that it is a 5 feet dummy. I really missed a bit of tension during the, but I liked the march tunes in the beginning by Ron Goodwin...

A pointless argument ensues, which culminates in the driver saying, You don't care a damn about me, do you?  No, says Harrison Ford evenly.  I don't.  The driver bursts out laughing, says, That's the first straight answer you've given me, and gets back to work.If you find the driver's motivations opaque throughout all of this, don't expect that the rest of the movie will render them transparent.  Instead, expect lots of other scenes every bit as idiotic as this one.  The screenwriters clearly favour the kind of lines that ring out across a stage. What they, and many third-rate playwrights, have failed to discover, is that such lines never sound other than stupid unless the characters have some reason to utter them.  To be or not to be is a fine thing to say, but it needs a context in which it is not nonsense.The pointlessness of it all infects the movie to its very core.  A group of people are tramping out to blow up a bridge (that's right they're travelling on FOOT to blow up a BRIDGE); but why this matters either way to the war effort is hard to remember, even while you're watching.  Few people behave rationally or even comprehensibly.  And the sudden detour upstream to destroy a dam in order to destroy the bridge is one of the most silly about-faces I think I've seen, capped with weak special effects that only serve to make us ask, How can a bridge which is impervious to all explosives be knocked over by a small flood?All the essential trappings of the original are missing.  The inessentials (Dmitri Tiomkin's trumpeting fanfare, harsh Mediterranean coastline, David Niven's performance) are missing as well.  But it's the kind of old war movie which you can watch, and even enjoy watching, while you marvel at its stupidity and wonder why you don't have anything better to do.  I'll give it that.

This is also filled with a lot of 70's style comments and subtle sarcastic humor which isn't consistent either.  Another favorite is when Carl Weather's character pulls a gun on his commanding officer (Harrison Ford) and get away with it, everything was just fine.

Well hell - shouldn't that have been checked out beforehand? SPOILER. So then they decide to bring down this HUGE dam upstream and have it collapse the bridge. When they get to the dam, they seem to know the entire layout of the dam and how to get past the guards to the most vulnerable spot and lay the explosives.!!! Even though blowing up the dam was just something they thought up the day before. I could go on and on. Millions of holes in the story.I like robert shaw but he was wasted in this movie. Edward Fox plays his standard British twit and is a pain. Carl Weathers has a fairly big part but is irrelevant to the story. Giant Richard Kiel is the only good thing about this film. "}]
