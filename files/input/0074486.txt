[{"Title":"The reason that I got into films in the first place!!!","Date":"28 December 2003","Score":"316 out of 393 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"   In film school it is not cool to say you like David Lynch. Film students claim he is just a poor mans version of Luis Bunuel. Yes, I would say that Bunuel is more talented and is the king of surrealism. But Lynch is very good and his films do challenge the viewer. I actually have a deep affection for his films. When his films work, they really work! However, when they do not work, for example, Twin Peaks, Fire, Walk with Me or Lost Highway then they quickly launch themselves into self parody. Many people claim his material is too inconsistent and indulgent to be really liked very much.   What I find strange is that one reviewer here states that he feel duped by Lynch. Duped? Why? The films all have a story. They just have a narrative that works differently to conventional film making. If you look hard at the film and try to understand the subtext then you will pick up  on what the film is about. I saw this when I was 16. I knew nothing about films or film making then. A friend and I were bored so we decided to see a movie at capitol cinema. Capitol cinema used to be a cinema that played arty or small independent films. They used to play midnight showings of eraserhead. There was always someone smoking a joint in that place. However, you don't need drugs for this film. Lynch is drugs. This film just buzzes you out. I had no idea what Eraserhead was about. I had never heard of Lynch and knew nothing about surrealism. I went in and was just totally blown away! Before this I had only really seen commercial blockbuster movies. Lynch gave me a whole knew perspective on what cinema is capable of. Eraserhead is the stuff of dreams. Lynch believes that watching a film is entering a dream state. Both my friend and I did not know what the hell was going on. I was fascinated...    Later I would learn this is a film about Lynch's own obsessions. His hatred of Philadelphia. His fear and anxiety at being a father. The film is just full of a kind of a compulsive, paranoid neurosis. It is a waking nightmare. He also seems to parody the nuclear family. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?' Meanwhile that weird blond woman in his radiator seems to represent his escape. A way to transcend from his grim world. What I also find bizarre is that people then accuse him of having no sense of humor! What? There are always funny moments in his films. 'Did you have sexual intercourse with my daughter?'Jack Nance is also very good as the main character. He seems to be playing the director and he gives a performance that is distant, spaced out and yet emotionally vulnerable. A really strange mix.   The imagery is just brilliant. Black and white in an industrial wasteland. There is smoke here of course. It wouid not be a Lynch film without smoke!  It also has a cool, grating industrial soundtrack that sets your nerves on edge. This is perfectly effective for the bleak tone of the film. It is so visually striking that the viewer will not forget the imagery quickly. There is a reason that this is a cult film. The other distinctive feature of this film is the long lingering shots. This reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his movies like Dead Man and Ghost Dog. The length of the shots seems to have the effect of immersing the viewer in this strange industrial wasteland.I have my own copy that I lend to friends. They then normally give it back to me saying that they only got through the first half hour. They also normally tell me that I am a weirdo for liking it. I think what frustrates people most about Lynch is that he will not give any explanations of what the film is about. So any interpretation is as good as any other. People want the film to be explained so they can understand it. Who said films must be understood or comprehensible? Why can't a film be abstract piece of art like a painting? Lynch's films are like an acid trip. To quote the great gonzo, Hunter S Thompson, 'buy the ticket, take the ride and if it gets a little heavier than what you  had in mind, then put it down to forced consciousness expansion.'  So in other words, relax, stick it on and just run with it. Travel into someone else's nightmare for a change...

My vision is blurred, but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Henry Spencer, the main character in Eraserhead, who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value, but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Henry seems to be devoid of any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. (I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell-hole it is now.) The city they live in is completely industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of soil on Henry's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Eraserhead before you see the film, as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.The first time I saw Eraserhead, I was completely confused. It is possible that David Lynch just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand, there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Eraserhead is enough to raise about a dozen questions, and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Eraserhead several times, and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Eraserhead is about, you would get six different answers, each equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Lynch film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well, Eraserhead is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you probably won't get much out of Eraserhead. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily. Love it or hate it, Eraserhead will stay with you for a very long time.

The Exorcist is one, a film that, aside from infrequent strains of `Tubular Bells', adopts minimal incidental music. This is laudable in a horror genre where shocks are clearly signposted &#150; and predicted &#150; by overgenerous musical stings. The Exorcist may be flawed, but its avoidance of this field clich√© is worthy of praise.Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound. A frankly disturbing concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical hall and sonorous church organ, it is almost an extra character in the film, and easily it's most prominent factor. Yet Eraserhead is to be recommended for more than its incidentals. An impenetrable and gloomy work, what is it actually about? Who is the credited `man in the planet' who pulls levers that control giant spermatozoa? Many questions like this permeate a film which perhaps has to be seen several times to get over the initial shock of it's avant gardism. Lynch extracts the everyday and supplants it with the exceptionally bizarre. The experience of meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time is never worse than here, where the parents in question gyrate spasmodically to the animated legs of a blood-spitting chicken. It's these scenes &#150; along with the deformed mutant baby &#150; that could lend the film the air of an abortion debate. Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the hall' and a mother-in-law that gets too close for comfort. I guess the entire film could be a man's mental breakdown when faced with the premature responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Though to be honest I couldn't even begin to imagine what it's really all about.Encroaching blackness fills every scene, where lights are intermittent at best, and at worse fail completely. Often sets &#150; particularly the bedroom when `Mary X' is feeding the child &#150; are like prison cells. Two of the most eerie segments involve a title-explaining dream (?) where Henry's (Nance's) head is carved into pencil rubbers and an unsettling musical number from the `lady in the radiator'. This is the same lady with two candyfloss-like lumps on her cheeks that alternates her stage appearances between stamping on giant sperm to singing with religious convictions.Direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely unpleasant aspects of reality. I took a girl to see this film once, where the conclusion formed the final straw in what could be seen as a cycle of repellent imagery. I wonder why I never saw her again?

It is not a film.It is a piece of art.All of the comments I read that attempt to describe it as a movie fail for precisely that reason. If you read the ones that can handle it, they handle it as an art review.So don't even think of it as a movie. Don't recommend it as a movie. It doesn't work.I'll also admit that I sat in a haze for decades, absorbed in the imagery. In awe of the impressions. And finally, an image crystallized, an image of what this was a portrait of.

I figure it's the perfect indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you're completely nuts ) But what the heck, they're a lot of nutballs on this website, so I can speak my mind freely. Indeed, I love this movie...although 'love' may be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it. This movie 'fascinates' me is a much better saying. Usually, a movie is something in which you can live yourself in...in order to escape the stress of real life. Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching this film, you can only hope that you'll never awake in the wold like Lynch shows it here. The horrible noises, the colorless and tasteless locations and the insensible characters...you all hate to love it. Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions, you don't know whether to be disgusted or intrigued by it. So you'll feel uncomfortable when watching it and that's a wonderful experience for a cinema freak !Eraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for every fan of this delicious genre. In fact, I would go so far to say you can't call yourself a cult-freak if you haven't seen it yet.David Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it still lives on. Eraserhead isn't his best film at all ( certainly not when it comes to storyline ) but it's his most deep and personal tale. 25 years old and still the weirdest film ever. That's an achievement, certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately...or, at least, they try to be...)I want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one, but it's for the best that some groups of people avoid it. Surely not recommended if you're depressed or suicidal...The image of Jack Nance and the rest of the cast could even put you more down, I think. The tagline of this movie - In heaven, everything looks fine - could become a stimulus, I'm afraid. Pregnant women and young couples in love should beware as well !! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that what should be the greatest miracle of life...The hideous but yet harmless baby ( I really don't know how I should call it, actually )is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen.You must have respect for director David Lynch. If you imagine how hard it must have been to create and finance this production. But it worked...hell, even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed. Based on this film, he decided to let Lynch direct The Elephant Man a few years later. By that, David's career was launched and of course he made a masterpiece out of it. For me personally, his highlights were the 80's with terrific movies like Blue Velvet, Dune ( very underrated, in my opinion) and Wild at Heart at the end of the decade. And let's not forget the best TV-series ever made Twin Peaks.Please, watch this movie !! Three times in a row if possible. I know a lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour ( or less ) and yelled What the f*** is this ???. Real shame, if you ask me. It's an insight to a great mind and a unique event. If you really don't see the magic of it, at least try to admire the very stylish haircut of the main character. I'm thinking of doing the same thing with mine...

Many people will find themselves confused by the strange atmosphere, surreal imagery, and signature David Lynch sense of purposefully awkward pacing.That out of the way, I would have to say that this is possibly one of my most personal favorite films.  It is dark, tense, atmospheric, and filled with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine.  It is a film that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend, but is quite a ride nontheless.  There are moments in this movie that will literally scare you, so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal art-film a deconstructed domestic horror movie.  This film, along with the original black and white Night of the Living dead, are two of the only films in existance that still scare me to this day. (Side note Also, I reccomend that you see Luis Bunuel's movie Un Chien Andalou to see where strange art-films like this originated from.)Anyway, the film's plot while initially incomprehensible to most, can be broken down into the tragic tale of a man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry.  During the film, he is forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate premature child birthed by his girlfriend, Mary X. (Charlotte Stewart)  However, he is consumed by his guilt, and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out.  But the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery that this is not always readily apparent.However, in order to better understand and appreciate the film, one must figure out what each of the images mean.  Here's a short cliff notes guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the movie***THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS***Worm = sin. These creatures appear all throughout the movie.  Henry even tries to hide his little sin from Mary at one point, only to have a nightmare where Mary is consumed by worms.  Henry's room is also filled with piles dirt and dead plants as one might notice, which makes his room a breeding ground for worms.The Baby = The product of sin. You might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm. Futhermore, the baby is a part of Henry, and later during the dream sequence, we discover that Henry IS the baby.  When Henry kills the baby, he kills himself.Eraser = Memories. Henry feels that his memories, or his brain with his bad memories, is like an eraser that needs to be rubbed out.  In his dream sequence, he sees himself losing his head, and having his brains turned into eraser bits to be rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind.The lady in the radiator = Death. Death looks grotesque, yet strangely appealing to poor Henry.  The radiator gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for Henry, promising to stamp out his sins (worms) and telling him that in heaven, everything is fine.  At the end of the movie, Henry embraces the lady in the radiator before blackness falls.The man in the planet = God. In addition to disposing of Henry's cofessed sins at the beginning of the movie (the worm coming out of Henry's mouth) the scarred man in the planet appears to prevent Henry from opting for suicide during his dream sequence. He silently reminds Henry of his sacrifice (the bleeding tree) though it is in vain as Henry shows God what he really is underneith.  (the baby)The last is a theme that occurs in all Lynch moviesElectricity and electrical lighting = The presence of good. Darkness = The presence of evil.There are other aspects of the film that keep popping up, such as the reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen.  Henry waits thirteen seconds for the elevator to open up, the lady across the hall takes thirteen seconds to appear, Henry's apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen, etc. Also, there are many other images which I will let you figure out on your own.***END OF SPOILERS***All in all, the movie is quite an experience.  This is a film that you will either love or utterly hate.  For myself, I managed to click with the movie from the first time I saw it and have enjoyed it since.  Repeated viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film, as you begin to notice more and more that you never saw before.  All in all, I say that it is an excellent and extremely layered film.With that, I give you some fun facts about the movie-The pencil eraser machine actually worked.  It was put together by Lynch and a friend of his.-To this day, Lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the amazingly convincing baby creature, though he claims is was created with substance/objects that anyone could find around the house.-Jack Nance's hair was incredibly malleable.  Literally, all it took was a little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get it to stand upright.-In order to get a better sense of textures for the film (possibly for the organs of the baby) Lynch dissected a dead cat.-When driving around town with the Henry hair Jack Nance would sit in the center seat while Lynch and someone else would sit on either side to keep his gravity-defying hair from being seen.

It's as far from the forgettable fluff of mainstream Hollywood as you can get, and as weird as it is, it strikes a chord deep in the human psyche. I don't think anyone could experience this film without being deeply moved. This beautiful, industrial nightmare comes as close to depicting a fever dream as any film ever could, or ever will! David Lynch pulled out all the stops to make Eraserhead as perfect as any film can be, and it shows. It is a great work of art in its own right. The characters and setting are unforgettable, and are as strange as they are familiar.  The story is slow-moving, but steadily builds with the fury of a small hurricane. The film walks a tightrope somewhere between the reality of the world we know, and someplace else.  Where that is, only David Lynch knows for sure.  Lynch is a fine example of a film maker who isn't afraid to take huge risks. That's how masterpieces are made.  Eraserhead is the proof.

Filmed over the course of five years (1972-1977), this film is the very first full-length masterpiece of artist David Lynch. I say artist because he began not as a director, but an art student. Finding canvas too confining, he moved on celluloid, eventually moving on to AFI to fund his script 'Eraserhead'. According to Lynch, the film was inspired largely by his stay in Philadelphia. To know how he views it, the film must be seen.The script itself was only 21 pages long, so it was assumed to be roughly a 21 minute movie; most people wouldn't expect that the film would be a living, breathing piece of art.The elements of the film cannot even be understood by film scholars. Lynch himself has said that in the 25 or more years it has been out that no critic or viewer has given an interpretation that is in line with his own. There appear to be prevalent themes of sexuality and conception, not to mention claustrophobia and physical discomfort in simply living. The film is definitely very affecting on a visceral level in certain scenes where Lynch appears to deconstruct the simplicity of family life and bring to the surface the inherent disgusting nature of feeding. Near the end, simple curiosity gets the best of the main character, played extraordinarily well-reserved by Jack Nance, and his mistake ends up causing his world to fall apart. Overall, the film logic seems to be one of a nightmare, an open-ended metaphor dealing with one man's fear of fatherhood.Put simply, there is no other film like it. Not even Lynch's later work can compare. This is on the must-see list for any film student, however, it may be annoying and make absolutely no sense to the casual viewer.

I've seen all kinds of movies, some I thought were brilliant, some overly pretentious. Eraserhead, though brilliantly directed, lacks a lot of support and relevance, and overtly attempts to be deeply symbolic. I remember when I enjoyed creepy characters and random disturbing scenes, but this film seemingly dumbs down the audience in an almost conscious manner.The story centers around Henry Spencer (Jack Nence) who lives in a world that either resembles a nightmare or a different dimension. His days revolve around walking around his industrial town, and sitting in his small quiet apartment suspiciously observing every angle as if he's never been there. He's told that his girlfriend (?) awaits him at her house for dinner, and with hesitation he joins her, again, in an awkward suspicious way. The girlfriend, named Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) lives with her parents and grandmother who follow lifestyles of some impulsive serial killers. After Henry finds out that he and girlfriend Mary X have a premature baby, he falls head first into a world of mayhem, delusion, and sexual provisions. His girlfriend gives birth to a mutant baby, and leaves him to take care of it by himself.Eraserhead is really unique, but over-stylized and pretentiously dangerous. In the world we live in today, an audience will fall in love with any movie that has some level of cult status. While I'll agree that the directing is superb, especially on such a low budget, the story itself lacks any drive. Albeit the movie has a massive creepy feel to it, from the subtle build up of bizarre sound effects to the sinister-like score, it leaves you empty and cold asking yourself what you had just seen. I've never been one to hold a good deep screenplay that leaves you thinking for hours against the movie, but in this case there's just way too much false instinctiveness.The mutant baby is a motif that the movie attempts to force in order for us to feel scared and shocked. And in the center of it all, the baby looks more like a dinosaur than a disfigured, dream-like figure. Then there's the creepy girl who sings a song about life in heaven, which Henry listens to for comfort. Her presence is almost unnecessary and oblique, making you tilt your head back more asking why? is this a film that observes the life of one man? Did he suffer from a traumatic experience? We don't know, and director-writer David Lynch seems to think we don't care. The movie opens up with a scene of what seems to be an asteroid and an overlapping image of Henry floating around. He then wakes up on the road and sets out in Chaplin-like posture, passing and dismissing anything out of the ordinary. In one scene, he invites his next door neighbor in and lets her seduce him into sleeping with her. They then end up in Henry's bed, falling deep into what seems to be water. A pretentious goof might say it's an excellent way of showing sexual desire and an atmosphere that seems to give Henry the relaxing feeling he's always wanted. I say it's the first thing that popped into Lynch's head.Half way through, I looked at my watch asking if it'll be over soon. Really, you don't have to watch the rest to get the basic idea of the whole thing. However I stuck around for the beautiful cinematography and excellent underrated directing. Lynch uses his camera and works with it like an Axe murderer would with a good victim. He separates reality with non-diegetic sound that the main character can actually hear, and really knows how to handle the framing in each shot.I watched the extra features and David Lynch put into words what I thought was a true representation of this film I have no idea how the idea came to me, or when it came to me. How could you? It's completely random and spontaneous. It also suffers from a weak ending, Henry gives up and murders his baby only to see the little asteroid -- or his shell of life -- burst and explode, leaving him to go into heaven with the strange butt-face girl who sings in his radiator. Well, problem solved, kill the itch and join peace for eternity. I think that's the idea the movie was conveying. As for the title itself, it's really pretty interesting.

It numbs and paralyzes any clear, lucid thought like the dull thud of a sledgehammer-blow applied directly to the skull.If you're seriously looking for a movie that actually induces brain-freeze (without the aid of drugs), then look no further than Eraserhead.Here's a movie that probably contains more WTF? moments than any other mainstream film in existence. But, of course, when it comes to these particular moments, the major problem here is that they just stack up way too high, leaving the viewer quite frustrated, annoyed and often gasping for a breath of honest-to-goodness fresh air after being suffocated (literally) by a non-stop barrage of irritating and nonsensical situations.The way I look at it, if it's considered hip and cool to be one of the chosen elite who love to gush and heap praise upon Eraserhead, then I can't begin to tell you how much it pleases me to know that I am looked upon as being an outcast and certified square.Due to a truly terrible sense of storytelling (which starts from out of nowhere and ends in the very same spot), I view Eraserhead as being something of an idiot's jigsaw puzzle where none of the ill-fitting pieces were ever intended to fit together into a coherent and satisfyingly entertaining whole, at all.I personally place full blame for Eraserhead's countless flaws and irksome short-comings directly on the shoulders of writer/director David Lynch. On top of being a total wiener-head, I think that Lynch is a frickin' pseudo-intellectual snob of the highest order.To me, Eraserhead was a film that wasn't made by someone who wanted to share any special or meaningful insights with his audience, at all. No. This was a film made by someone who was clearly looking down his long nose at his audience and saying, loud & clear - Ponder this, you stupid, low-life peasants! As far as I'm concerned, the only appealing and noteworthy aspect about Eraserhead was its (sometimes) startling b&w camera-work.

Eraserhead is the worst film ever made,and as such it provides the baseline for all film - including adhesive tape, pond scum and the stuff on the tile in the shower rooms of abandoned prisons. All filmmakers since 1977 have been liberated and emboldened by the knowledge that nothing they produce can be called the worst - not The Weatherman, not even Machete.Mathematically, it proves that the concept of worst is finite - that alone is noteworthy.Just as importantly, it proves that no matter how bad something is, there will always be people that try so hard to be different that they will claim to like it.

I admire Lost Highway and Fire Walk with Me, I liked very much The Straight Story, Twin Peaks and Elephant Man, and I found Blue Velvet interesting.I've also seen Eraserhead three times in theatre, and own it on DVD. I've made a virtual HTML simulation of Twin Peaks' Black Lodge, and plan to include parts of Eraserhead in it.But Eraserhead, as much as one may like it, is just not as deep, or artistical, or surreal a movie. It is, like Kafka's Metamorphosis, a one-sided view from a pathologic mind, of a very banal situation.What's the plot ? A schizophrenic man discovers he made a child to a girl he spent some time with. Forced by her parents to marry her and to take care of the baby, he just can't cope with it because of his mental pattern, and therefore kills it in the end.That's it.The only original thing about this is that it's seen from the main character's point of view. But, like with The Metamorphosis this leads to 1) Weird scenes that makes sense only for the author and aren't meant to be communicated to an audience. It can make big suggestions to your subconscious, and therefore lead you to a dreamy mood, but many MTV music clips can do that as well. It *isn't* surrealism.2) Gory, barely justified gooey effects.3) One-dimensional atmosphere, in the case of Eraserhead, a grey, dirty, greasy, industrial one that's not artistically justified - there goes the art side of the movie. It's quite well handled and interesting if you're into visual art as I am, but it's also boring because, well, one scene looks exactly like the other.4) (Nearly the worst)  one-dimensional characters. Since they're seen from a schizoid point of view, they're all weird, ridiculous, unpredictable and potentially hostile, in short, a nuisance (schizos like to be left alone). No character depth like in Fire Walk with Me, for example. This simplification includes the baby, seen as a monstrous thing that looks like what it probably was on set  a dead animal covered with glue so that it wouldn't rot too soon.5) Passive main character. He's just not doing anything, except in the end (?). It makes the movie all the more, well, inept, action-wise.6) The worst  obvious meanings. Yes, Eraserhead fans, you read me. Henry (the main character) can't sleep with his pretty neighbour because of the baby ? The baby laughs. Henry is afraid to make his wife pregnant again ? We have a looooong scene of him pulling giant spermatozoids out of her vagina. Henry's mind is vanishing because of the baby ? The baby's head pops out of his body, and his brain is used to industrially make pencil erasers - hence the title. Gee, what may this all mean ?!So, all in all, what we have here are either symbols that mean something for Lynch alone (many of those themes, like the show scene with curtains, the zigzag floor, or the blinking lights, are by the way found in his other feature films, which are all better), or that are painfully shallow (examples above).So, in short, just a bad film in itself, which is quite normal for a first feature-length film which took five years to direct with no money. Still, it may interest you if you like Lynch, or visual art (flawed works are often more interesting to analyse than successful ones) - or it could just lead you to quite an interesting mood if you're not the dreamy type all by yourself, and like to be forced to dream instead of being gently suggested to do so.

From the beginning through to the very end, the surreal imagery is all relative to Henry's mental condition. Now it doesn't have to get this specific, but you can rationalize it down to the fact that Henry has a mental tumour or growth that is causing his grip on reality to fracture and decay and is slowly killing him.Everywhere Henry goes, we see destruction. It's in all things, -the barren dug up earthen fields he walks, the house with a hole in the roof and cracked windows in which sits the charred man pulling the levers, to his apartment which gives new meaning to the decorative term earthy. Lynch uses the mounds of earth as a symbol for decay, much the way Dali does with ants in his paintings and short film Un Chien Andalou. A recurring image of Henry's interior decay is light bulbs dimming or burning out altogether when he's around...and we take this as a figurative illustration of the sort of erratic synaptic firings that are happening inside the ol' Eraserhead.Now there may or may not be a Mary X and a Family X, it could all be part of Henry's dissilusions, but their roles are less important than that of the baby...the fact that the Doctors aren't even sure if it is a baby about sums it up. Lynch couldn't have made it more ambiguous...it's not a proper baby, it's not a mutant...it's a growth. It's a manifestation of Henry's tumour or whatever disease it is that is eating him from the inside. Once Henry is left alone (it's all relative to who actually exists or not) with it, it suddenly starts decaying hideously. Henry's condition worsens. The only redemption he can find from his terrifying insanity is in a vision of a lady in his radiator inviting him to heaven through the radiator bars as if they were the pearly gates themself, telling him that there everything is fine. The woman herself is deformed as well, as Henry's projection of his sickness pervades everything around him. Yet the woman is his redemptor as she crushes the little wormly fetuses, helping soothe the spread of the tumour within. Henry's tumour manifests itself in a couple of other ways as well, one is the man in the house with the hole in the roof. The house is a cage, it's his skull, and it's got a severe deformity if it has a hole in the top, letting out all sanity. The man is charred, burned and twitchy, he's in decay, yet he's the one pulling the levers for Henry's brain. His tumour is a malignant, destructive thing, yet it is what is in control. It is what releases the worm like babies....it's sending itself elsewhere to create further decay. Henry's apartment is like himself...it's in decay, and the piles of earth do more than just remind of us that in a passive way...Henry's pet worm that he finds in his mail box tunnels through the earth gorging itself on it. That is what worms do, they eat their way through earth, and as a metaphor they are a physical representation of the destructive force of Henry's tumour, which is eating itself through his brain. Now I wish I could watch the movie again before I wrap this up, but I'll do my best with what my memory gives me. A couple of tangents...Henry fantasizes about his beautiful next door neighbour, but as she enters his world, he doesn't want her to see his growth...ie the baby, he doesn't want her to recognize his problem, but as they make love she can't help but notice, while all the while being sucked down into the void of Henry's psyche. The next thing that happens is that Henry's brain is being probed and drilled into, again highlighting the sensations and pains Henry must be receiving from this malignant growth. The next time Henry sees his neighbour, (in reality), he imagines she looks at him and sees only his decay, ie the head of the baby. This is when we come to the final destruction, the final decay, the final seizure or anneurysm.... The baby, the growth is only very precariously being held together by its bandages...as Henry's sanity is also dangling very precariously. Henry decides to stop fighting, and let the baby, let his sickness loose, to grow and overtake him, which it does, the insides of the baby swell and overflow and the baby's head increases in size 10 times, and the rest of the apartment self destructs, the power outlets spark, the lights go into epileptic fit, and the sound effects, which I have failed to mention but play an important psychological role all through, come to an excruciating head. Henry is left facing what it was we saw in the opening scene...what looked like a planet but what is actually his tumour, exploding towards him, and then it's all over and he's in the arms of the Lady from the Radiator, holding her, letting go of the pain and the trouble, and ready for his good thing. It's a very obtuse film, but very sad and beautiful and troubling all at once. It'll never leave you. -Ed "},{"Title":"What is Taken Away","Date":"23 April 2010","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" It puzzles me that anyone would rely on the term surrealism. I suppose that one could say that everything that is not real is surreal, but what is the value in this? Annoyingly, newspaper critics toss the Quay Brothers, Bunuel, Jodorowsky, even early Cronenberg in the same bucket as Lynch and call that that.All art is surreal. If an artist is worth your investment, it is because she has something unique to offer. I'm not all that crazy about Bunuel, but his gift was how he could seamlessly merge the sense of things we know with those we lose control over. The Quays astound me with worlds invested in object views. Jodorowsky's stitching into the familiar is via worthy comment on theatrical tropes.Lynch is different, wholly different. A whole different experience.There are a number of ways to get from the world each viewer believes is real to the world of the film. That world by itself is less valuable than the connections that are maintained between the two worlds by the process of pulling them apart. These are what the artist can pull in changing your soul.Cronenberg for example does this by adding to certain elements of the ordinary and blowing them into crystalline forces. Many artists do this in a general sense. Cronenberg selects the most uncomfortable obsessive seeds to grow from. Madden from worried elements of memory.Why Lynch is so vitally important to your viewing journey is that he abstracts into his worlds by taking away rather than adding or expanding. I imagine his legendary bible verse, the one he says that explains this is a verse in the New Testament clearly not there and taken away, erased. Though Lynch is hardly a good authority on himself, this matters.This whole thing's value &#x97; and his much more mature Inland Empire &#x97; is about what he takes away. Lynch did not start as a filmmaker. Like Greenaway, he started as a painter. Painters understand this notion of showing by removing. He made extended studies of dessication with animal remains for years before entering the AFI program. One of them is here, the decayed hollow of some pet animal that Henry plays with via an attached wire and his shoe. Memories are made of what is omitted. The gift of birth is as much about the unmakings and undone as anything.Some of what Lynch does here fails I think because in spite of it all he could not escape some desire for overt obviousnessess. The business about the sperm- embryo- brainstem props is simply juvenile and gives stoners something to chortle about. He abandoned that stuff later. Really, Empire is where you need to be, with its erasures structured according to a polish tradition &#x97; which just happens to coincide with that missing bible passage.Lynch's God here should be taught in school, next to Joseph Smith's gently healthy patriarch.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

A disturbing slice of surreal black comedy that is one of the most uncompromising movies ever made, and still one of the strangest. It's very much a love it or hate it kind of picture, and even viewers who enjoy many of Lynch's subsequent movies may find it difficult viewing. I'm not sure whether like is the best word to describe how I feel about it, but I admire it, and watch it every couple of years, and every time I watch it I am still astonished by it. Jack Nance stars as Henry, an average Joe living in a decidedly non-average world! Lynch used Nance in most of his movies after this, but for many he will always be remembered for 'Eraserhead', just like Jeffrey Combs will forever be associated with 'Re-Animator' and Bruce Campbell with 'The Evil Dead'. The plot of the film in many ways is very simple (Henry's girlfriend Mary gets pregnant, and the couple marry), but it gives absolutely NO indication of what a bizarre experience this movie is going to be! Anyone who has never seen it will be in for a shock, even if they are familiar with Lynch's other movies. Lynch's most recent picture, the grossly overrated 'Mulholland Dr.', had many people bending over backwards to explain and solve it as if it were a puzzle or game. 'Eraserhead' shows how futile it is to do that with Lynch's work. He is essentially an American surrealistic who delights in presenting weird and unexplained images to the viewer. 'Eraserhead' is full of them, but unlike 'Mulholland Dr.' (in my opinion), there is some kind of internal dreamlike logic, which while it may not make sense feels right. I would say the same thing about 'Lost Highway', his unfairly maligned movie, which to me ranks with 'Blue Velvet' as his most satisfying work to date. 'Mulholland Dr.' ultimately felt like a con job on the audience, 'Eraserhead' doesn't. That still doesn't mean it's easy to digest. It isn't. But it seems pure and real and doesn't appear to be playing cynical games with the viewer. 'Eraserhead', whether you truly enjoy it or not, is an important movie and is highly recommended to every movie fan. You may not want to watch it twice, but you really should see it at least once!

It can be then stated that if people watch something they don't understand and like it anyway then that can mean they can be watching any images on the screen and it wouldn't matter. It's like putting a baby in front of the TV, the baby isn't so intrested in what's actually on the screen as much as it's intrested in the fact that anything is on the screen at all. It's all just fodder for dumb monkeys with Nikes. This theory seems pretty airtight to me because admittedly I don't have any idea what's going on most of the time in David Lynch movies. This one I think I have a pretty good idea. I often hear the word nightmare mentioned along side Eraserhead. Most of the time the word as used as a generic term without much thought. But if you think about nighmares or dreams in general you might think of times where you've had dreams that you just don't understand because nothing makes sense in them. For instance you might have a dream that seems allmost perfectly rational, but always there will be one or two elements that don't quite fit in. Like you're having a dream where your having sex with your best friend's kid sister in her room, but then she asks you about your eye color and suddenly her room is your third grade class and your covered in ants. Doesn't make two bits of sense and is so non-linear that it's beyond comprehension. So instead of the term nightmarish being generically used, it actually is acurately applied. All that aside you can start think about this movie on drugs. Anyone who as ever done acid can claim two things. One, is that under the world of drugs nothing makes two much sense in the immediate sense, only the overall reality is understood, if at all. Two, we've all heard the stories of somebody's bad trip. Usually something along the lines of, he thought the couch was trying to eat him so he attacked it with my uncle's set of ginsu's. Well put these two idea's together and a thought forms. How little sense does the world make to someone on a bad trip of acid, let alone the WORST TRIP EVER!!!!!!?  I think you hear me knocking. This movie began production around 1972, right around the end Woodstock generation and the heyday of LSD consumption. It's not all that unlikely that this is either Lynch recounting his own acid trip which would explain his subsequeent insanity, or a tale Lynch might have heard from a friend of a friend.PS Show this movie to your twelve year old child after having explained how great the wonders of hallucinogens are, and that they're all like this.

Most of the film is very ambiguous, so this is going to be basically what I got from the film on my first viewing rather than an actual review, but let me just say, I wholeheartedly recommend that you watch this one if you're into film and especially if you enjoy art-house, or even if you just want to watch something that is entirely original. The film uses a perfect combination of make up, set design, editing, industrial sound design, costume design, lighting (or rather lack thereof), black and white grainy cinematography, acting and long, uncomfortable takes to create terrifying imagery that sticks with you long after you'be finished watching. It also creates one of the most oppressive, bleak, and absolutely nightmarish or dreamlike atmospheres, even though there were even parts that I chuckled at, and it's worth watching just for that completely unique experience, but I do believe there is a hidden meaning behind most of this film. Again, keep in mind that this is a very, VERY ambiguous movie and this is just my interpretation.So this film takes place almost entirely in Henry Spencer's mind. The film starts with a shot of what seems to be an isolated planet with a dirty man on it whose only purpose is to pull levers. Then once he pulls the lever a worm-like thing that strongly resembles the baby in this film comes out of Henry's mouth. Now I believe that the man on the planet pulling levers is what henry fears he is A small worker who's a sole purpose is to reproduce and have a rather small role in a larger company. This idea is reinforced by the following shot which shows Henry looking scared and then quickly walking further and further into the background, growing smaller and smaller until he escapes behind a wall. He then goes ton his girlfriend(?)'s place where he meets her mother, who plays her role by supporting her mother, helping her play her role by helping out with the food, even after it seems she may be brain dead. The father is a hard working middle class plumber who works a lot with his hands. This reinforces Henry's fear that he may be only an insignificant cog in a much, much larger machine. He gets the news that he has a son, and I'm and the mother very much do not want it. But of course they feel pressured to take care of it, so they bring it to Henry's apartment. It's worth noting that before they even bring it there, it seems the apartment begins to become a sort of nest like habitat, showing that Henry is worrying about his singular place in the world before he needs to start caring for this baby. The baby itself is disgusting looking and horrible sounding, and this is to start how that to Henry and his girlfriend, this baby is a very ugly burden, not a wonderful blessing. The girlfriend starts to get more and more anxious about this baby, and eventually just leaves. Eventually, the beautiful woman he sees at the beginning of the film seduces him, and it seems he sees this woman as a way out from the dreaded responsibility of having to deal with this child. The film then shows a woman in a dream that has two tumor like things on her face on a stage, and we've seen this woman before stepping on these worm like things that look very similar to the baby. This time she sings a song to Henry, saying that everything will be better in heaven. I believe this woman represents a way out of his anxiety, especially when juxtaposed with the beautiful woman. However, when she says heaven she obviously means death, and Henry then has a terrifying vision that maybe even after his death, the baby will live on as the only part of him left on the earth and he will still just be used as a tool in the machine and no one will remember him. He decides he needs to use the beautiful woman as his way out instead. However, next time he tries to meet with her, he sees another man with her and she sees him and he fears she can only think of the baby that has been dominating his life and driving him insane. Now it seems the baby is laughing at him rather than crying, and he decides that the only thing he can do is murder this baby. He does that, and whether he kills himself after or not, it seems he's escaped this vision of himself considering it shows the planet that the dirty worker from the beginning was on blowing up and the lady in the radiator kissing himSo, in short, I believe the film is about the fear of growing insignificant or unimportant in a society more and more heavily reliant on machines, the fear that you have only one purpose in this world and the fear of parenting and marriage and all responsibility that comes with it. Those are basically my raw thoughts on the film after my first viewing, and there is obviously a lot that I skipped out on because I didn't understand it. And you know what? That's OK. I don't think I'll ever COMPLETELY understand this film, but that only makes it more rewarding with each viewing really, and that's hard to come by in a film.

It's truly a testament to your intellect while you attempt to deduce what the hell is going on. The clear story we get, however, is very interesting, dark, and simplistic.Characters- The characters, like the story, are difficult to figure out. Each one is a mystery, and they are all vastly interesting. Henry (the protagonist) is somewhat normal (by David Lynch standards), making him very relatable, forcing us to ponder what we'd do in his situation. The rest of the characters are all so delightfully strange and twisted. Many of their actions are so alien to us, that it's actually somewhat surreal. It feels like they're all small puzzles that the audience is supposed to figure out, and needless to say, each one is immensely entertaining to watch and analyze. Meaning/Themes- The meaning of Eraserhead is by no means clear. In fact, it took me hours of research to get a grasp on the basic themes of it- and that's where the real fun comes in; analyzing, researching, and theorizing. A great movie is clearly supposed to make you think, but Eraserhead takes that to another level. Imagery- The imagery is incredible. It's disturbing, surreal, and heavily relies on it's brilliant nightmarish atmosphere. It's both amazing and difficult to look at.Tone/Atmosphere- It feels like a nightmare. It has a very dream like atmosphere, and its surreal tone instills a constant feeling of uneasiness in the audience, because you know anything can happen. Flaws- It is very difficult to critique such a unique film. I can't compare it to anything else (if you do, you will hate it), so I have to judge it in its own realm- which is extremely difficult, because only it exists there. I cannot find a blatant flaw, and if there is one, it's become hidden in the brilliant surrealism.In conclusion, Eraserhead is well worth a watch. It's thought provoking, surreal, terrifying, and surprisingly entertaining. If you aren't a fan of David Lynch, or surrealism in general, you won't like this movie. If you are, or you're open to new forms of art, I strongly recommend at least one viewing.

He has career that ranges from slow family friendly dramas to dark surreal horror films. Yes their are few directors that are as skilled and innovative as David Lynch. With a career as vast and impressive as his, you have to wonder where he started. Was he someone like Akira Kurosawa whose earlier films are almost entirely forgotten, or was he someone like Orson Welles who came out of the gate swinging. Well luckily for the world David Lynch falls into the second category.Eraserhead is a small, low budget, minimalist, surrealist, atmospheric, horror film. And it's plot is, well open to interpretation. It's difficult to make out exactly what happened in the film, (especially on your first viewing.) but the things you will pick up on are basically what follows; there is a guy with a weird haircut called Henry Spencer who lives in a nearly empty apartment building. Henry's life is filled with many strange things like a seductive neighbor, a large pile of dirt on his dresser, and a strange fascination with his furnace. Henry then gets invited to dinner by his girlfriend, Mary X, who he hasn't seen in a few months. At this dinner many bizarre things happen, but the main point of the scene is that Henry got Mary X pregnant a while back and she has now given birth. But Henry points out that she couldn't possibly have't oven birth yet, Mary X tells him that it's premature and the doctors aren't even sure if it's a baby. After this it slowly becomes more and more difficult to figure out what's going on as Eraserhead dives deep into the mind of its protagonist, penetrating his deepest thoughts and darkest fears. Eraserhead is one of those films that is open to interpretation, basically meaning that there is no one objective thing that the film is trying to portray or mean. This simply means that the film is going to mean different things to different people. David Lynch crafted a surrealist film that called back to the creator of the surrealist film genre, Un Chein Andalou. Both films contain macabre images that were ripped strait out of the directors minds and then put to film. Many of David Lynch's early short films were supposed to be almost adaptations of his paintings, and that's what it feels like in Eraserhead. (I'll talk more about the imagery later but I'd like to get back to the Un Chein Andalou comparison.) The one major difference between the two grotesque sets of images is that, Luis Bu√±uel said that you could play each moment in Un Chein Andalou in any order and it wouldn't make any difference. But Eraserhead definitely needs its order and structure. In Eraserhead it's not just random things that are shown completely unconnected, which is what Un Chein Andalou is, a lot of the horror and tension comes from the slow build up to the really horrifying parts. Eraserhead would not be nearly as memorable if it just 90 mins of intense random horror.Eraserhead is a film that has complete mastery over both its visuals and sounds. The cinematography, first done by Herbert Cardwell and then by Frederick Elmes after the first died, can only be described as creepy. And when it's matched with David Lynch's flawless inventive production design, it's able to give the film a thick an unnerving atmosphere. The way Lynch lingers on each shot for so long, letting the audience slide into his disturbed world. Not to mention the way each scene is lit, I mean it really is just one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen. And the excellent sound design and score, both done by Lynch himself, are incredible. In each scene their are so many layers of the sound that all come together, and it somehow never feels muddled or weighed down by all of the layers, in fact it only adds to the experience. Eraserhead was basically produced in purgatory. David Lynch made the film while he was studying at AFI (American film institute) and he was given full access to their studios. However they under estimated what Lynch was cable of, the script he turned in was 21 pages long, so they predicted that the film would be 20-30 mins long. And when they found out how long the film actually was several members of the AFI tried to reject it. So the film spent nearly seven years in production. Jack Nance who played Henry Spencer and his wife Sissy Spacek, helped fund the film through its difficult production and I have to say I'm very grateful of that. Eraserhead is a landmark in surrealist filmmaking, inspiring people everywhere to make films no matter how small or insignificant they seem. Eraserhead forever changed not only the way films are made, but the way their watched.9.7/10 "},{"Title":"An Entirely One of a Kind Experience","Date":"24 January 2016","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I would provide you with a plot summary, but I feel that it is best that you enter completely ignorant of its elements, instead i will give to you a few words on my love of this film...

A very abstract, surreal & hallucinatory meditation on the fear of fatherhood & a few more things I happen to be unsure of, Eraserhead is one of the creepiest films I've sat through and I still don't know what to make of it.Eraserhead tells the story of Henry Spender, a hapless factory worker who is on vacation & is invited to dinner by his girlfriend at her parent's place where he learns that he's the father of a grossly deformed child. As the two start living together in Spencer's small apartment in an industrial landscape, the unbearable screams of their offspring drives both of them near to the point of insanity.Written, produced, directed, edited & co-scored by David Lynch, Eraserhead opens with a strange, dream-like segment before its main plot surfaces. Every frame of it is jam-packed with symbolism & much of its black-n-white imagery makes no sense at all. While the story left me sort of cold & frustrated, I was indeed amazed by few of its technical wizardry & its influence on later films.The set pieces have a simple, minimal design but Lynch ends up using every bit of it in the final print. The greyscale photography is raw, unrefined & eccentric but the use of lighting & shadows is truly admirable. Editing paces the film accordingly but it also makes me wonder if Eraserhead would've sufficed as a short film. Sound design is definitely its major highlight for it makes its odd surrounding all the more unnerving & dreamlike.On an overall scale, Eraserhead is one of those art house flicks that viewers will either reject outright or embrace it wholeheartedly over the course of multiple viewings. And since Lynch wanted each viewer to come up with their own interpretations, pretentious garbage is just as valid an opinion as timeless masterpiece. Strange, peculiar, unsettling, unconventional & outlandish yet intriguing & amusing in bits n pieces, this queer combination of surrealism & experimental filmmaking is more or less a check mark for me than anything else and I've no plans of returning to it anytime soon.

Despite its weirdness though, I actually found it to be thoroughly entertaining and I even got a few chuckles out of it due to its weirdness.Henry, our protagonist, faces a number of bizarre and horrifying obstacles before meeting someone of the opposite sex and her family.This film sure does have a lot of weird events which go on in it. However, I feel that every event which goes on in it has a purpose. Also, I felt that none of the events were there just to be there. None of them felt forced and many of them caused different reactions out of me. Some of them unnerved me while some actually got a few chuckles out of me due to how bizarre they were. It was an odd reaction I got out of it but it did make the movie more entertaining.This film may not make much sense to some but it's art. Art has multiple interpretations to it. Many people have their own interpretation to the film. I've seen many of them. My interpretation of the film is that it takes place on another planet and all the weird things which go on are alien-like. They seem weird to us but it feels normal to all the people who live there. There are a few other valid interpretations I've seen brought up but this one makes the most sense to me.Also, the visuals are amazing. Despite being almost 40 years old, they still look very disturbing and that's pretty impressive especially when you consider other films around the time period. Also, I really liked the sound design. It is well-done as well and it also adds much more to the disturbing graphics. It works well with the visuals.In conclusion, this movie is amazing. I think that this film is an outstanding masterpiece. This is a superb work of art. It leaves a lot of room for interpretation and it is never too complicated as well. If you want to see one of the most weirdest movies out there then make sure you watch this. It is not only weird but it is also well-written.

Lynch deftly crafts a world at once vaguely familiar and lived-in, yet cold, uncaring, and utterly alien, populated by characters as bizarre and off-putting as the world they inhabit.

How can one honestly enjoy the macabre and disturbing imagery? How can one definitively pinpoint the narrative or intention when the creator has said nary a word on the subject in 30 years? Most of David Lynch's work has been moderately accessible if you're willing to work at it. He's been equally successful with a straight-forward narrative (The Elephant Man, Straight Story) as he has with the bizarre (almost everything else).

By golly, it is very strange and hard to figure out. I watched this film and when it ended I was pretty much like, What did I just watch? A surreal type film where it seems Lynch is taking us to a world that is similar to ours in many ways, but vastly different than ours in very disturbing ways. A place where life is just as normal and dull as a day in our own lives, but at times is an utter nightmare so horrid that those who live within it just wish for death to escape it. Still, one wonders what it all means as this film kept becoming more and more bizarre as it progressed. A very disturbing film that had odd bits of humor here and there and periods where one felt uncomfortable to watch.The story has a man named Henry. He is apparently on vacation and his girlfriend apparently wants him over for dinner. He goes to this dinner only to learn that not only is Mary's family very strange, but also that Mary has had a child...or perhaps something else as Mary herself said that they were not even sure it was a baby. Well, Henry becomes a father unexpectedly and soon his girlfriend leaves him with said child. He becomes frustrated and wants the neighbor across the hall, but is also drawn to the mysterious girl within the radiator who sings of heaven.At times, I have no idea what is going on, but at other I feel almost as if I do. When Henry goes to meet his girlfriend's parents it almost seems to me that Henry suffers from social anxiety disorder. That everything is being blown out of proportion by his condition. Suffering from this condition when I come upon things I am not used to and being around people I am unfamiliar everything seems to go wrong in my mind and the most awkward situations keep popping up. Like how he gets roped into carving the chicken which promptly bleeds and the mother runs out of the room screaming and then the father tries to have a conversation with Henry who is very uncomfortable at the moment. Then other parts of the film are just so strange that I am unable to figure out what is going on except Henry is becoming increasingly unhappy and frustrated. However, he seems to find relief at the end as the last shot of him embracing the girl in the radiator shows him having an expression of pure relief.So, this film was well done and is something that is up for interpretation. I do not find it pretentious as I feel a more pretentious film shows imagery that tries to make it look like it is showing something really deep, but in reality means absolutely nothing. Here, I do get a sense that there is something behind what is being presented. Lynch did an excellent job of presenting this strange world and I would almost like to see more of it as it is such a strange and horrific place. Henry's story ended, but perhaps another viewpoint could have been done at one point of this nightmarish realm that so mirrors our world, but at the same time has deep cracks in it.

It's easy to see why, given that David Lynch created a cult classic on a pittance of a budget, showing off some masterful direction and producing a piece of work that is not so much a film as it is a piece of art.Henry (Jack Nance) lives in a run-down suburb in a nameless city. His life takes a turn for the worse when his girlfriend gives birth to a mutant child. Unable to cope, she leaves Henry with the baby where slowly his sanity starts to break down. While Eraserhead may have a plot, the story is unimportant; it's about the atmosphere and the feelings and emotions it conveys. Dialogue is sparse, but expressionism is rife, much like the old silent films. Moreover, the line between reality and surrealism is blurred, with the film often being punctuated with classic Lynchian dream sequences.It is important to realise that Eraserhead is not meant to be entertainment. In his debut, Lynch creates a nightmare, one that is disturbing, eerie and haunting. Eccentricity pulses through it, whether it be Henry's hairstyle or the fact that it is filmed in black and white, detaching it from the real world even further. As a film in technical terms, especially considering that it was made in the 70s over the course of five years, Eraserhead is flawless. While one can argue that it has dated and that it may look cheap, it hasn't at all, retaining the same effect that it did thirty years ago. The mystique and horror does not fade, and it remains as hard-hitting as ever, influencing later classics such as the Elephant Man (also Lynch).A truly timeless film; accomplished, beautiful, pure and horrific. The most Lynchian David Lynch film.

For example compare this to Ron Howard's 'Grinch'.  Both have interesting art direction, but Howard focuses on the story sanitation while Lynch thinks visually--and to heck with mainstream coherence.  Mild Spoiler, if you can call it such.Here is Lynch's major attempt at surrealism.  Like Scott, he is constantly misunderstood by studios and audiences.  Actually, we understand Lynch better than Scott because we always assume Lynch gives us something weird.  With 'Dune' the studio wanted 'Star Wars', he wanted '2001',We have some interesting points here and I'm not just talking about the baby.  Consider--We have the photographer of 'Hulk'.  Considering Mr. Elmes has worked with Lynch up 'till 'Wild at Heart', I'd say he learned more than any of Spielberg's photographers have since 'Jaws'.  Elmes has now passed the torch to Ang Lee.--Notice how many roles Lynch takes on, this is his 'El Mariachi.'  His only other major collaborator here is Alan Splet.  Judging from his later work, I think the exhaustion from making the final sound mix is what drained Splet of ideas.--This, like 'Fast Times', uses the guilt-baby motif.  The finale is Snowden's secret spilled all over again.  Since Lynch isn't concerned with making sense, you're either in on the gag or not.Lynch would recycle his themes with 'Elephant', all of them in a Good Samaritan wrapper similar to 'Straight Story.'  So we accept it as feel-good material and accepting his weirdness as drama. If film is meant to express a tone or mood, Lynch goes one further by sending ideas in sound.  Everything either displays experimentation or give the impression of it.  Skittish meditation.  Kubrick tried this method in 'Shining', but missed the effect.  Sonnenfeld would have us think this was funny.This deserves at least one viewing.

But if I tell you about the lady that lives in the radiator, the (what I call) floating man, & the creepy parents, we are going to disagree in what we think we see. For example, I saw a world where nothing was working out for Henry, and that Earth, if that is the planet he is on, hates him. Stepping in a puddle, having an elevator disagree with his presence, and generally being the cause of everyone's trouble gives me the feeling that poor Henry has bad karma issues. Someone else will see a nightmare. Or perhaps Henry is in hell, custom made for him. But is it really depressing? Or is that just the way I was seeing it? It's worth detaching yourself a bit and feel the movie's dreamy state set in your brain for a while. Rather then analyzing everything, allow it to seep in and haunt you for the rest of your life.I can continue telling you all kinds of things that happen, or I think happened, such as adultery, murder, & suicide, but you probably won't find all of these things in the movie. You may find that adultery is just a fantasy, murder is actually love, and suicide is an awakening. Or none of these things. Or something different.Regardless, you must see Eraserhead. It's a film that begs conversation after you see it, but that's just what I thought. To someone else, this may be over-indulgence, egotism by David Lynch, a weird movie that must be forgotten to others, and to a select few, the most imaginative, visually stunning work of art on film.

This is possibly the best film made by David lynch, the way it is shot the editing, the weird factor goes thru the roof, incredible acting by all the actors they played their roles to perfection making us feel that we were there right next to them in that industrial nightmare filled with strange noises and the feeling of anxiety at every step. The sound deserves a special note because it is one of the best scores i've ever heard in a movie. It's haunting, never stopping for a second never giving the viewer any time to recuperate and it contributes a lot to the general feeling of the movie along with the many themes and ideas that are hidden beneath the surface from alienation, abortion to the deep study of human psyche, ideas that pop out at every corner. Thsi movie is not for the occasional movie watcher that wants to see things blown up and stuff like that but if you want a movie that makes you think long after it is finished then find Eraserhead at all costs.

And there's a lot of people that don't like this film (particularly the guy who's written about seven paragraphs explaining why)Their argument seems to be that only pretentious, arty people with goatees enjoy this, and even then it's only because they feel they have to or they're not smart. Although that may be the case in some instances, I don't think it applies to everyone. I don't get this movie, but I love it. It's mesmerising.David Lynch himself often says that his movies have no deeper meanings. That's a bit of a lie. There are infinite deeper meanings, so everyone can end up with a completely different interpretation of what they've seen. Just because something means nothing to one person, it could explain the essence of the whole film to another one.But the real reason for writing this review is to say why I loved Eraserhead. I love it because I find it hypnotising. It probably helps if you like the art of H.R.Giger (the designer on Alien), or the strange pictures inside early R.E.M. albums, because this film appeals largely on a visual and aural basis. The world in this film is a very dark and despairing place, all derelict buildings and industrial noises. It's like a horrible nightmare to begin with, but then you see the baby...Essentially, I think you already know if you're going to like this film or not. If you've taken the trouble to actually search for Eraserhead and read reviews before you've seen it, then it's worth a look. If you've accidentally stumbled onto this while searching for Eraser, then don't bother. It really is the ultimate love it or hate it film, as you can probably tell from the reviews that are all calling it the best or worst film ever made.

Are there valid reasons for infanticide? For abortion? Perhaps. But Lynch's gun is loaded with William's ammunition A contrived depiction of a very bleak reality. God is presented, grinding the wheel of random predetermination, Mother Nature is transfigured into beautiful grotesqueness, and life itself is shown as a hideously deformed baby, perhaps half worm, half human. Who cares? Existence is so coldly stark in Lynch's eyes that any deformation would allow itself. Perhaps the worm unnervingly gives light to his attitude towards humanity.

And years later, having immersed myself in all of Lynch's work (minus Twin Peaks), going through numerous other cult and nightmarish films, and even recognizing the slower bits in the film, it still holds up for me as one of the filmmaker's masterpieces. Believe me, you will rarely see a stranger and more terrifying film in your lifetime until you see this. The plot (which if you can find you win a prize in your mind I think) has a weird zombie-like man (with a Al Sharpton like hair-do) who accidentally gets his spastic girlfriend pregnant and what comes out is a creature that is probably the unwanted child of an alien and a gasoline can. For most of the film though are images and scenes of macabre and fright that are authentic in their own way; abstractions that sometimes are humorous (the best being the highly uncomfortable and classic scene at dinner with the chickens) and sometimes purely out-of-this world. Lynch, while artistically might be by this work as mentally balanced as The Monster in Frankenstein, can make a film so weird, evil-feeling, yet compelling as all hell, that it boggles the mind. Very low budget, this is definitely one of the top 10 best debut films ever.

What a freakishly beautiful piece of absolute terror. Th night after I first watched Eraserhead my dreams were plagued with devilish, mutant fetuses with terrible laughs. I couldn't get the eerie song 'In heaven, everything is fine' out of my head for months. I slept barely, fearing I'd wake up in an alternate reality with dead, twitching chickens, evil babies, crazy seductive mother-in-laws and a consistency of visually disturbing hallucinations.But how awesome. This film is based around it's own world that you have to take at face value. I tried reading into it deeply, but I found myself far more confused trying to think of a real point, instead of just believing some poor fellow who sees things go stuck with a mutant child that seems to enjoy driving him mad.I've read reviews saying that... thing... was harmless but disgusting, but I have to disagree. It seemed like the whole movie centered around it driving him more crazy than he had been before. It's sickening laugh, horrible cry, the way it started crying every time he tried to leave the room, was like it was just trying to keep him in that tiny, windowless (the window on th wall had brick built in... what's the point of even building the window?) room with only his own insanity to keep him company.

In this case, I feel that he was so busy striving to make a social statement, so busy being artistic, so busy trying to prove his worth as an artist outside of the mainstream, that he was rather self-absorbed in imparting his vision. Yeah, I get what he is trying to say. I just think that he could have said it better.

Some started with the phrase, 'Once upon a time...' and others started, 'A long time ago in a land far away...' What they had in common was that they were narratives; they told a story with a beginning and end; the stories went somewhere. 'Eraserhead' goes nowhere, which is okay as long as the viewer knows what to expect. If I go to an art gallery I don't expect all the paintings or photos to work together to tell a story, but when I see a movie, I do. 'Eraserhead' is like a disjointed dream, where events happen without reason or rationale and immune to the ordinary rules of genetics. I think Lynch is very creative and imaginative and a talented cinematographer, but he is no story-teller in this effort. I liked the B/W treatment and I thought the movie has terrific visual impact, but very poor narrative. It's almost as if Lynch had been given 10 different story elements to put in a single story but couldn't tie them all together. Who is The Man in the Planet and what do the broken windows, levers, sores and twitches represent? What does the burned-meatball-of-a-planet mean? No one seems to want to discuss these items. Does it mean anything or is it all part of a inexplicable nightmare?

The latter, consisting mainly of low-frequency hum and other background noises, will definitely haunt you for a long time.It is grotesque and repulsive, and although it does have a bizarre story, it lacks a real narrative thread.

I have trouble understanding why someone could ever hold this as their fave but I can see it was something very personal to director David Lynch who strove five years to make this 85-minute film.For the film is not just gibberish as many critics stated on its release, it plays out in the forced perspective of Henry Spencer 's heightened realities a father's fear of having to care for a hideous newborn-child alone and of what his actions may be if it's ceaseless wailing continues ; a boys awkward tendencies upon meeting his girlfriend's parents and the weirdness he perceives of them; the doom-n-gloom of our protagonist's cityscape and residence are heightened to fit into Eraserhead's towering vision of horrors.I say horrors but there are actually two minds through which to watch Eraserhead, one as a surreal horror and the other as an absurdist comedy. The horror is so repulsive you may literally look away the whole time while the comedy is so hilarious your tears may blur your vision. Lynch deserves some credit from the all-too-ready-to-criticise critics as this is a really special thing for a director to attain. This dream language Eraserhead's images speak is impossible to translate into realism and requires adherence to dream logic on the part of the viewer. One skill Lynch certainly has is capturing the language and flow of dreamscapes. Most of Lynch's film forced my mind to wander to the corners of the wall of my bedroom as I found it similar to being told of a friend's dream -exciting for them to tell but boring for me.

If we define genius as an unusually powerful capacity for doing original, inventive work, then we must decide whether or not this film meets that criteria. It is unusual, there's no denying that. If by powerful you mean that it stirs the emotions, and we are discussing a piece of work in an art form and the measurement of whether or not something is a work of art is if it affects the emotions, then yes, it is powerful. Emotions can be affected in a positive or a negative manner by a work of art. The imagery in this film is dark and disturbing. It is an experimental film, which tends to make one think of it as original and inventive. It could easily be said that it is not, in that dark, spooky films about grotesques have been made almost from the beginning of movies. But just because a certain type of film has been made before doesn't detract from the quality of the film under discussion. The real issue here is whether or not Mr. Lynch's work can stand as an organic whole. This is where I think it begins to get into trouble. Mr. Lynch has filled the film with images that probably mean something to him. However he doesn't communicate that meaning to his audience except for an overall feeling of repugnance and dread. If we go back to the concept that a work of art's primary function is to communicate an emotion, that perhaps that is enough. However, a film, and this one is no exception, is a narrative. Narratives are supposed to communicate ideas. They tell stories. This film tells a story, but the characters are doing things, and events are happening that don't make any sense. Mr. Lynch probably knows what's going on but he doesn't share that knowledge with the audience. The film is filled with powerful images but they don't coalesce into a coherent story. There is no why and wherefore. I'm sure many people will say that a work of genius doesn't have to explain itself. It just is. That's a point of view, but most people require some sort of meaning in order to derive enjoyment from a film. Is mood enough of a meaning to make people want to sit through a movie?

In the outtakes scene it seems he cant even walk down the street without getting his leg caught up in a hanger with a dead cat attached to it( the same dead cat lynch disected in real life out of curiousity) i think lynch played a mortician in another movie a while back also,,,i see a theme here and it seems to be that people with little wild obsessions get paranoid and one wrong move and kablamo all over the place. but hey, according to lynch im sure im wrong,,,,,,,yeah right.

This sort of connect-the-dots approach to film has almost always been the tack taken by moviemakers since the beginning of motion pictures (except for the earliest films that were simple exercises rather than planned-out pieces of either art or crap). It's unsurprising, because of the common nature of novelish movies, that when a film breaks from that format, it's met with disregard or contempt.Eraserhead seems to be one of those divisive films that one either thinks brilliant or ridiculous. Those who see it as ridiculous are those who expect films to follow clear plot lines and can't handle a series of provocative images that aren't necessarily cogently connected.Those who find it brilliant are more open-minded about the possibilities of film they realize that a major part of the significance of film as art is the emotional impact that sequenced images can deliver (this being why tear-jerkers are so popular). Eraserhead functions on a emotional rather than cognitive level--it is a nightmare, as Lynch calls it, and as such it doesn't present any thematic element above the emotions it brings out in the audience (assuming the audience experiences emotions other than outrage). In this sense it is much more akin to poetry than to prose, and it shares poetry's value as an investigation of human experience through emotion rather than reason.Eraserhead, much like the rest of Lynch's work, is sort of like impressionist painting, which was derided by critics when it was first introduced to the art world. Those critics who voiced disgust with the work of Monet and his contemporaries were those who expected painting to be about the arbitrary subjects in a picture. Monet painted light, not objects, and this new approach to art confused many. In much the same way, Lynch makes movies about one's reactions to images rather than about the arbitrary subjects of a given film, and because of this he may well go down in history as one of the true geniuses of the medium.

It has a lot ofelements that will later appear in Lynch's movies (the checkeredfloor, freaks, that stage-backroom, etc.), so there is that familiarity. However, whereas later movies have sex and violence, this haswormy things that tend to be pretty gross.  It doesn't ruin the movieat all, but I wouldn't advise pregnant women to watch it.The music, as always in Lynch movies, is neurotic and soothing.

In spite of truly bizarre occurances (Roast chickens start kicking and oozing blood at the dinner table while Mom has a seziure apparently unnoticed by everybody else; grandma seems catatonic, but mom still gets her to toss the salad, etc., etc., etc...), Mary comes from a rigidly traditional family, completely crass in it's need to know if Henry had sex with Mary, what Henry does for a living, and it's assumption that he will marry Mary after presenting him with flimsy evidence that they've had a child together. The values that force Henry and Mary to marry are shown to be as much a part of the machine that has created the industrial hell in which they live as any other force.Their universe seems post-appocalyptic in its desolation; not a wisp of vegetation anywhere, and almost no clues about time of day. I suspect a rational explanation for the setting of Eraserhead might include some alien takeover; Henry and Mary's premature baby doesn't really look human, and it's introduction to their lives is more than a little suspect. Not to mention the worms that keep appearing everywhere,looking like dissected human central nerve chords.While I firmly believe there is no one way to interpret Eraserhead, itdoes touch on a number themes that fall into the social commentary bin. Isolation deepening simultaneously with physical connection (pipes)as a metaphor for sex that alienates, marriage forced by  circumstance, etc. It manages to get the viewer (at least this one) thinking about these issues in an abstract way. I don't know that I really enjoyed the film (although Harry's dream where his brian gets turned into eraserheads was humorous) but I didn't find it worthless. As an image and soundscape, it was truly brilliant.The intentional mix of plot and diversion succeeds in tempting and then thwarting analysis, like a painting or a sculpture. As such, this film is guaranteed to alienate a large audience. Some of Lynch's more recent films (Mulholland Drive, for example) are puzzleboxes that start the viewer out in this state of confusion, but actually make a lot more sense once the puzzle is figured out. Eraserhead deliberately induces confusion, and intentionally maintains confusion throughout, with no resolution intended. As such, it is typical student work, untainted by the need to be palatable to large numbers of people, unencumbered by the idea that many will lose interest because they do not see value in maintaining states of confusion (it's called developing an attention span). As with all things, it's a matter of taste.

It seems that almost all films are made to satisfy a target audience and then deteriorate with time, making their once topical plot points and jokes very dated. Then comes along a film that seems to have been made on another planet, or some other dimension. Eraserhead is that kind of film. A month after watching this film your brain will be unable to digest the visuals as just a movie and may interpret its bizarreness as a nightmare that you once had. I rented this for my wife one night and while it was playing she complained through most of it that she just wanted to go to sleep. It took a lot of shoulder tapping to keep her awake, and although at the end she said why didn't you just let me sleep through it, the next day she made a complete 180 and was very grateful that she had seen it (there was a similar sequence of events when I showed her Carnival of Souls - the Eraserhead of the 60's) I suppose this movie is the most surreal, drug induced experience you can have without physically poisoning your body. If film is Art (like paintings) then Eraserhead belongs at the top of the heap, because whereas almost all films are made like hotel wall art (visually pleasing to its audience,) this film is so avant garde and non-commercial that it may be one of the most personal movies ever made.

It's outer shell of rock and granite masking the bony, toothless freak that sits beside a window, frantically pulling at shafts and gears, in some madcap attempt to stop the whole thing erupting or exploding into shards of broken crust and pebbles.This is Eraserhead, a film that represents the wounded, soulless day-to-day grind of our society.  A world in which parental responsibility is enough to enslave you in a four-walled-cell, where ants mindlessly collect dirt in your underwear drawer, homeless people fight in the street below, and a hamster cheeked lady in your radiator promises you that in haven everything will be fine.  This is the cinematic equivalent of a Radiohead album.  Exploding onto our screens in a barrage of mind-boggling images, throbbing with cinematic experimentation and structural metamorphosis.  What is Eraserhead anyway? Is it a black comedy, or some kind of overtly pretentious student film?  Perhaps we're dealing with a social satire?  We can never be certain.  Eraserhead is all of these things and more, representing David Lynch's second greatest filmic achievement and perhaps his most purely realised vision of hell.For our protagonist Henry Spencer... this is a hell on earth -- if we can call it earth.  Henry is a shy man, imprisoned in a uniform of grey-flannel-suits, pocket protectors and half-mast trousers.  His hair stands on end like some sick mockery of a cartoon character, as if some instance in his young life terrified him so much that his hair shot up and refused to come down.  Everything surrounding Henry practically oozes foreboding.  Even dinner with his girlfriend Mary ends with bleeding chickens, spasmodic fits and the news of an unwanted pregnancy.  And with Mary's mother chewing and salivating all over Henry's face, is it any wonder that he prefers to sit alone on the end of his bed, listening to the strange carnival music that pulsates from some far-off corner of his psyche.  Not really.This is Lynch's darkest vision.  A film filled with despair, longing, and an oppressive atmosphere that damn near chokes us.  We're searching for an escape route from Henry's shoe box apartment long before Laurel Near arrives to tell us how we've got her good thing, and she's got ours.  No matter how much slapstick humour Lynch throws into the mix it can't silence the screaming chickens and almost constant industrial hum that fills the soundtrack throughout, dragging us along with Henry, kicking and screaming to the brink on insanity.  We can turn the tape off, we can walk out... we can escape the tempting lure of hamster-face and her lull of sweet insanity... Henry is incapable of this.  The over-the-top performance by Jack Nance as Henry simply adds to the film's overall surrealism... whilst the black and white photography and exceptional use of sound-design effectively create a world like no other.  The film grows stranger and stranger with each scene, as copulating couples disappear into the flowing, milky liquid that pours out of the bed, whilst mutated babies laugh at their father's social weaknesses, resulting in death, destruction and metal collapse.  This is one of the strongest films you'll ever see, a vision of bleakest, blackest life, a snarling monster of a film that massages our brains before pulverising them with a pair of scissors.  The black blood flows as the planet explodes and lightness invades the screen.  Sure this isn't a film for everyone, it isn't supposed to be.  Nothing is ever explained here, some things need no explanation, and thus we are free to feel Henry's confusion...  No, this is a film for those unafraid to stare into the darkness in the corner of the room, a true landmark in experimental cinema, and in the art of filmmaking as a whole.  5/5   "},{"Title":"Odd, opaque, outstanding","Date":"17 June 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Long before the coffee and cherry pie approach of Twin Peaks, the controversy of Blue Velvet or even the life and times of John Merrick came Eraserhead. An afterthought of the hippy era, a reflection on parenthood or the strangest nervous breakdown ever to be recorded on celluloid, Eraserhead could be all of these and possibly, none of them. So is the Lynchian nightmare.Shot in stark black and white, Eraserhead focuses on Henry (Jack Nance) who lives alone in an empty industrial estate with only his fantasies of a woman living in his radiator to keep him company. Recently discovering his girlfriend has given birth, Henry becomes more unhappy and introverted. Posing many questions concerning tolerance, loneliness and of course, parenthood, Eraserhead is certainly one which film students could spend sleepless nights puzzling over. However anybody can enjoy it, if they approach it with an open mind.Like Blue Velevet, Lynch uses a relatively simple narrative to communicate his themes and ideas. The viewer is presented with many, slightly uncomfortable scenarios and images which could be either social commentary or a confession of a troubled mind (Lynch or Henry). The lack of dialogue makes the film even more startling as does the lack of interaction Henry experiences between other people giving an impression of extreme melancholy. Nance is wonderfully distant as the central character and is given a truly spectacular hairstyle as a reward for his performance.If you are expecting The Straight Story or even The Elephant Man, you should stay away. Eraserhead is disturbing, challenging and hugely rewarding. Superb.

Anyone that's had children can certainly relate to this aspect of the film . The warping of reality as a result of the baby crying frequently and being woken up at all hours of day and night is something else that I could have never imagined prior to having children.

It makes no sense at all, but it still gives you this strange feeling only a lynch movie can give you. I say it makes no sense but actually it does. I watch most Lynch movies as a dream. You watch it without much thinking and let the images work on you, and then you watch it again, trying to understand it. But since everything is in a dream you can't explain it with normal logic. You have to use dream logic, going from one scene to another without an obvious link. But unconsciously Lynch has a link between the scenes so it's up to the viewer to find that (or another own interpretation) link between the scenes.And if you watch all of Lynch's movies like this you don't have to explain the weird stuff (like the switch of bodies in Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive)but they make sense in a dream-like way once you find a link between before and after the weird stuff. What's different  about this movie(when compared with Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, Dune, ...) is that here Lynch uses actual dreams and reality together, although reality seems to be the nightmare. And the dreams of a (not that much) better place (like the song about heaven) make sense when living in this nightmare.So when you watch this (or any other Lynch poetry) just let the images talk to you, let it get you in the mood of the movie and try to link things with each other, but don't try to explain it, that's impossible. I loved this movie and every frame of it will be in my mind for several weeks (maybe months) and that's exactly what this movie wanted to accomplish. I give it a 9/10.

I was trying to clear my mind of the overwhelming hype surrounding the film, but some of it lingered as I watched the fair-quality VHS bootleg.  I was prepared to call the movie slow and pretentious, but now the right word is DELIBERATE.  The events which conspire are are less confusing and more NIGHTMARISH.  As the integrity of film as an art form deteriorated and gave way to formula and committee thinking, it's hard to find films that not only have certifiable integrity, but also prompt you to think.  Eraserhead is an ideal example (Videodrome and Fight Club are others), a movie whose bleak exterior is nothing compared to the emotional and psychological reactions it brings.  Like Cronenberg, Lynch is a perpetual trickster, a court jester with an ace up his sleeve, wrapping a narrative around the viewer's mind like a hit of Ecstasy, to the point where nothing you see or feel seems real for a long time afterward.  I wondered how much of Henry Spencer is inside me?  What began as a hideous, deformed, wormlike creature has given way to the creature that is now typing this.  Is there a difference?  An elevator that hesitates before closing, a mailbox with nothing in it, two halves of a ripped picture, a hideous mutant baby.  A lot of what I saw seemed to be making a point--or implying at least--self-conscious behavior in everyday life--the intimidation of cutting a miniature chicken whose thighs thrust and whose rectum oozes blood; the nervousness of a man being interrogated about SEXUAL INTERCOURSE; the baby that cries only when its father leaves, and its sudden outbreak in odd boils.  A brick wall outside a window.  A man pulling a lever, the sound of a train outside the window.  Comments on fidelity as Henry sleeps with the seductress across the hall, the production number by the 'lady in the radiator' with sagging, 'genital' cheeks as she squishes sperm with an unflinching grin, the wiping away of eraser-dust.  As with Blue Velvet (Roy Orbison's 'In Dreams') and Mulholland Drive (Club Silencio), Eraserhead possesses a similarly simple musical number (a song about heaven) that seems to symbolize the characters and events--SUMMARIZE, I mean, but the connections remain vague unless you devote time to studying it closely.  I regret now calling Lynch's mindbending films pretentious (although honestly a few ARE)--Eraserhead and the more recent Mulholland Drive symbolize a dying breed of cinematic artist, who assembles half of a jigsaw and allows the viewer to exercise the power of reason to figure the other half, but playing fair and keeping the challenge equal.  Even after watching Videodrome recently, I wasn't met with the same awake-with-nervous-jitters feeling that Eraserhead has given me--it's a distorted, perverse view of our own reality (even though it looks anything but) and reveals how self-consciously bizarre bland, everyday routines, sex, sharing a bed with a member of the opposite sex, and childbirth really are.  As the clock approaches 4, Eraserhead has branded me with a red-hot cattle prod, a mosaic of images that endure and are complicated in the mind after the actual film ends.7/10 "},{"Title":"X Rating?","Date":"23 May 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Why was this film originally given an x rating.

To hate the film because one does not understand it speaks to the viewer's laziness. Most American studio films of the last twenty years or so are easy to understand because they are marketed to teenage boys. Lynch makes films for himself. He does not pander. Furthermore, I appreciate that he does not condescend to the lowest common denominator, but rather puts it all out there for us, as the viewers, to make of his vision what we will.Lynch follows Shakespeare's advice and holds a mirror up to nature, but the mirror is decidedly Lynch's. If you've done any research at all on Lynch, including simply watching a making of of one his films, then you soon realize that Lynch, blessedly, does not see the world in a conventional fashion. That being so, it is important for anyone who enjoys his work to see this film, if for no other reason than to gain a rudimentary understanding of Lynch's visual palate and the collection of themes that he is continuing to explore to this day.For example, I recently purchased the Eraserhead DVD which, incidentally, is gorgeously produced and worth every penny. After watching it, I was struck by how many details of camera angles, sound, scenic design, thematic elements, editing, and so on, ad infinitum, appear in his later work. In order to confirm this thought, I watched Blue Velvet again and was astounded by the number of parallels*Laura Dern's entrance in Blue Velvet/The Beautiful Girl Across the Hall's entrance*The passage of the camera (i.e. - the viewers eye) through holes (or portals) to alternate worlds (e.g. - the hole in the planet and the hole in the roof of the shack in Eraserhead and the ear in Blue Velvet)*The camera's movement over the planet in Eraserhead and the camera's movement through the grass in Blue Velvet*Henry as a stand-in for Lynch in Eraserhead and Jeffrey as a stand-in for Lynch in Blue Velvet*Redemptionand so on....Eraserhead is the key to Lynch's work, but like Lynch, nothing is terribly clear and things are often askew. Possessing the key is not a promise of clarity but it does make getting through to portal to his alternate worlds a bit easier.

Now, when I say it is the weirdest movie I've ever seen, I do not mean weird in a negative sense. It is strange, but it is also intelligent, challenging, experimental, thought-provoking, and breathtakingly ambitious (especially when you consider this was Lynch's first major film). The film contains maybe 8 characters (some of whom are more implied than actually seen), but the film really revolves around Jack Nance, a truly likable screen presence with a malleable face who, despite his wicked-vertical hair-do, is probably one of the best everyman in film history. Eraserhead shows how Nance's character, who seems to be an ok guy, has his life tipped-turned upside down and right-side up again. He accidentally gets his girlfriend, Mary, pregnant. That is bad enough, but it gets even worse when the child turns out to be a horribly mutated accident of nature. The rest of the movie takes place over one night and shows how this offspring effects his life. My opinion is that the film is a nightmarish vision of a possible apocalyptic future we are headed toward-but that is just my interpretation and should not be taken as fact. I could go on and on, but there is a 1,000 word limit to these things. So let me just say that Eraserhead is a truly unforgettable film full of images, ideas, and thought.

David Lynch's, Eraserhead, follows a road full of unusual twists and turns much like the unkempt hair of Henry. In a brilliant and unexpected way, Lynch depicts all of this oddity with great form and order, just like the orderly outfit displayed by the un-orderly Henry. Eraserhead takes viewers on a journey through a demented world full of oddity and unrest. With Henry as the connecting character, viewers learn that his put together appearance is nothing like his unusual life. His sinful deeds of premarital sex with co- star, Charlotte Stewart, playing Mary, has resulted in a mutated baby, lacking arms, legs and hair.Lynch's five-year process of filming the movie seemed to be a waste of an extra four years and six months. The dialogue amounted to about a page of words and the shading was so blurry at times that scenes were hard to make out. If such a huge process is going to be made out of filming, then make the best of it, for the viewers' sake. On top of Henry's sinful deed and the resulting being, he goes through a process of coming and going and shares his bed with several ladies. With scenes filled with unexplainable items falling from the ceiling, and a mutated dancer singing, `In heaven everything is fine,' this movie, screams to be psychoanalyzed. Due to the lack of dialogue, Lynch calls viewers to interpret the background noises as if they are spoken words. Without actual words to rely on, and with a huge lack of clear visual images, background screeches and wails fill the scenes of this sci-fi esque film. The imagination is allowed to run wild through the wild haired Henry's life, as it twists and turns with every screech. Lynch's brilliance remains unseen to the untrained eye in his first movie, Eraserhead Due to a lack of dialogue, scenes with major shading problems, and a plot line as crazy as the hair of the lead character, the film requires a degree in psychology in order to understand a thing. Although masterfully arranged and complied, the common person will be left confused and wanting a refund on their money.

You probably had difficulty sleeping soundly, and maybe some strange dreams.  Lying there in the dark, in that half-awake, half-asleep state, is the closest thing in real life to Eraserhead.This dark, nightmarish piece of work is surreal, like the early work of Luis Bunuel (e.g., An Andalousian Dog).  The plot, if it can be called that, seems to have been drawn from someone's subconcious mind.  It almost seems to have been dictated by someone under hypnosis.Eraserhead can be interpreted many different ways.  And while David Lynch has made a number of other films (each one rather bizarre), none have attained the cult status of this one.  That's because of its unique, dreamlike quality.  You can watch it over and over, and each time get something new out of it.  Some of the imagery is very disturbing, and not for the squeamish.  You have to see it to believe it.  For best effect, watch it alone, late at night, after at least several drinks.

It belongs in a category with 2001 A Space Odyssey, parts of Fantasia, and maybe Barton Fink. Of course, it has very little, if anything, in common with those movies, but that's part of my point. Lynch mixes ordinary, workaday human experiences (being kept awake by a crying baby, having a guest for dinner, listening to a record, etc.) with the utterly bizarre and inexplicable. This is done, for lack of a better word, convincingly and without the heavy-handed irony and self-conscious weirdness of his later films and television shows (watch Blue Velvet if you don't know what I mean). My only complaint about this film is that its cinematography (which is, here more than in an average film, integral to its artistic message) is very hazy and low-contrast, making it very difficult to tell what is happening in some scenes. Watch this in a darkened room, write down your questions, and then sleep with the lights on and your mom on call.

Even if you don't get Lynch's vision, there is still no denying the power of his ideas and imagery.  Its interesting that Lynch dislikes the idea of applying psychoanalysis to his work as this is some kind of Freudian archetype spilled on to celluloid, with many sexual and psychological avenues explored and depicted.  Profoundly disturbing (especially the final scenes) and surprisingly funny at times as well. Topping it all off is the eccentric presence of the late Jack Nance in his definitive role.And remember folks In heaven, everything is fine....

While there is some intellectual insight to be gained from this and many of Lynch's other films, part of the appeal is also quite the opposite.  Lynch is really quite childlike, he's playing with ideas and images, and part of the appeal is the way he abandons conventional narrative and just has fun with the medium.  Although you could hardly call this film fun.  Lynch is also a painter, and really his films are more like moving paintings, it's about the images, and the sounds. People watch films, and really they're not looking at the pictures of listening to the sounds.People are also unaware that his films are meant to be funny.  I've seen people laugh nervously at this film, presumably because they thought it was unintentionally funny, but that's not true, one of Lynch's major style points is to have scenes which are both sick and hilarious.Whether you love it or hate it, this film should be seen, and seen all the way through, even if it seems very boring at first.  It's probably even better to watch it more than once.  In my opinion, I'd rather watch a film that's different but I don't like, than some paint-by-numbers hollywood junk that offers nothing different and wastes two hours of my life.  There's far more experience to gain from the former, and if you don't at least try something different, how do you know you don't like it?

For example, some people have the idea that everything in the film is from the viewpoint of Henry.In my opinion, and only an opinion, this is a one-sided way of analysing the film.  Such a reading would explain that the film's imagery is the hallucinations of a mentally abnormal person.  This would be disappointing, because it would destroy the idea of the 'world' in which Henry lives.I see Henry as a character living in a particular world, the world which is the movie and in which the movie takes place.  Henry is mostly passive - we see the world he lives in, and what happens to him, but he doesn't actually get much done.  Henry does some things that we don't understand, and his reactions to things are sometimes unexplained.  It is all part of the movie, and part of the world in which Eraserhead takes place.Not everything in this world relates in an expected way, or a way that would be possible in our world.  I think that David Lynch loves to do this and does it very interestingly.  It is not just in this movie in which a world is created that doesn't quite fit together.  Some things are familiar, yet behave in unfamiliar ways.  Some things are extremely bizarre.  This seems to be something that Henry has accepted as a result of the world he lives in.I think that if a person reads all of the unexplained events and images as being in the mind of Henry, they end up trying to figure out what is happening in reality - separating this 'reality' from the events that are supposedly 'imaginary'.  This may lead to the idea that all of the 'imagined' events are due to an explained mental condition, and are all a result of unexplained things that are happening in the 'real' world (these being the 'story').  Nothing, of course, is explained, and thus a lot of people who see the film in this way complain that none of the 'story' makes sense.The idea that Eraserhead is a world in itself, where normal rules don't apply, I think allows for a more 'free' viewing of the film.  We can see the images of the film and experience them in our own way, and we aren't limited to thinking that they must somehow explain Henry's condition or what's really happening.  It is hard to explain how this affects me and it probably affects everybody differently.My opinion of the film?  I enjoy the film.  I think the sound design is particularly interesting.  I really like a lot of the moments in the film.

Fascinated depression, appalled sympathy, and an ever present feeling of gratitude that although I was present in this bleak, inhuman, industrial, possibly toxic world, it was just a dream and I would be away from it eventually, unlike Henry Nance.The events draw you along in morbid curiosity as Henry goes about his business, fate not being very kind to him at any particular point. The pacing is slow enough that one has time to muse on the meaning of what transpires while the dank grim surroundings press down on oneself as they do on Henry.Should be watched in the evening with darkened lights.

I would find myself singing In Heaven, and couldn't help think of scenes, especially one in particular.Possible Spoiler--Scroll Down to skipThe scene around where Henry decides to kill the baby, the one where the lights flicker, and you see a giant baby head flickering around the room, as the lights come on and off.

Despite that fact, that night, when awake late at night and getting a snack, I couldn't help but think of it. I couldn't make it go away easily. I also showed my friend that scene and only that scene, to show him the creepiness. He, in turn, was also equally creeped-out by it, and when trying to sleep at a 'movie night' of ours, we both couldn't stop thinking of it. Other scenes were haunting, but this one got to me the most; I can't explain any better than I have.

To others, that is the ones who'll rightfully give any movie a chance, will no doubt find Eraserhead one of the most fascinating movies of all time.We follow Henry, and basically only Henry, as he operates in his grey coloured world. He is both innocent and confused throughout his daily life, forced into situations beyond his control, much like our own suburban mishaps (meeting your girlfriends parents and embarrassing yourself). Henry's life can be viewed as a complete mockary of our own. His problems are our problems, only given some LSD and thrown off a cliff. He slowly drives himself over the edge as he stares at the angel in his radiator and contemplates suicide. When Henry reaches dinner at his girlfriend Mary's house, we learn that he has impregnated her, thus giving in to the most primitive of human temptations, lust. That is Henry's sin, and his punishment from God (The Man in the Planet, possibly) is a deformed baby. And when i say deformed, I mean DEFORMED. Henry and Mary are soon both living in Henry's closet-esque apartment, but in contending with the screeching baby, Mary leaves Henry alone to deal with it. And rightfully so, since it's his punishment. The baby cries through the night, but once it stops Henry tries to leave the apartment. The baby cries louder as Henry tries to run, escape if you will, so basically they are both stuck together. Henry later destroys his sin, and thus is free to live with the angel (the lady in the radiator) in heaven (the radiator). He faced his punishment and ended it himself, becoming free from it.

Half the audience walked out during the film, and the critics were screaming that Lynch was either an incredible genius and the newest god of cinema or a raving psychopath and candidate for a pre-frontal lobotomy.This film MUST be re-released in the USA on DVD! There is no other film like it, nor will there ever be. It is as if someone crawled into someone's brain and filmed their dream. The black and white stock, the threadbare budget, the odd atmospheric sounds, and the organ music all combine to form a strange, strange work. You will either love it or loathe it. There simply is no middle ground!Henry Spencer (the title character, when you see the film you'll find out why, and it's not because of his hair) is forced into marriage with his girlfriend, Mary X, after she gives birth to their (horribly mutated) child. After she abandons both of them, Henry goes into a reflective mode in which he sees a woman performing on a stage behind his apartment's radiator, and wanders off into a series of hallucinations, dreams, and visions. The film is loaded with psycho-sexual imagery (Freud would have loved this film!), and has been dissected by critics looking for meanings to every nuance.If you get a chance to see this, it may answer many questions you have about the film-maker's other works.

There is nothing that has to be understood in this movie. This movie is a trip, nothing more... the only thing on celluloid coming near to a bad dream than anything else I have ever seen. But despite of that the protagonist Henry is a sad character, there are lots of emotions in the movie, but the most people don't realize it, because they only think of it as some weird piece of dark-minded art.Eraserhead is undoubtable one of the (I will not say best, cause this is a matter of taste I think) important movies ever made.

I can't think of another film in recent memory that has so chillingly and effectively addressed the issues of sexual relationships and accidental parenthood in such a dark manner.  Quite simply, this is a film for and about men; it is a nightmare so chillingly familiar that is almost imbedded in the collective unconscious. Thematic points aside, there are a few technical aspects of this film that potential viewers should be aware of.  First, there is very little dialogue in the movie; Lynch prefers visual to auditory communication.  Second, it cannot be stressed enough that this film is indeed what could be called surreal and thus is not very keen on ideas such as linear narrative structure or objective reality.  However, once one gets past these elements, one can appreciate the way in which they add to the dreamlike feel of this film.

I think I watched it in the best way possible, other than the theatre.  I sat about a foot away from a 12 inch TV, with a pair of headphones plugged into it and the lights off in my room at 130 in the morning.  It was a tape of the laserdisk that was released in Japan, and the Japanese subtitles served to add to the surreality.The reason it was beautiful lies in the sound, the shot composition, the timing (particularly the elevator ride), the dream sequence the dog, and the embrace of the radiator lady with the dust dancing and the blinding, warm light.More disturbing than this film is the amount of people who post messages describing how much they disliked it, and the amount of people who posted what they thought to be the obvious meaning behind it.  There is no definite meaning, you find your own which is relevant to you, and you recognize that it is not the one true meaning.  In this aspect, I am reminded by the film of Poe's The Raven.

Eraserhead is an extremely disturbing experience that holds your attention with a horrific fascination, even though you know you don't like what you see. There are things that happen in this film that make no sense until you begin to recall your own dreams, and then you wish you hadn't made sense of it because now you won't be able to get the images out of your head. There are moments of very, very black humour ( the chicken dinner comes to mind )and moments of very strange sexuality but the overall feeling is of alienation and cruelty. The final part of this nightmare, if you make it that far, is so tragically cruel that those not in possesion of a strong stomach may find themselves feeling disturbed, queasy and almost certainly angry. It has been said that David Lynch made this movie as a reaction to his child being born with a deformed foot. If that's true then he has succeeded in making us share in his pain and suffering with Eraserhead. See this film because it truly is a unique experience but be warned, it really is a disturbing experience that will stay in your head for a long, long time.

The first two radiator coils form an `H'.  The sock's placement suggests the letter `O', and the remaining verticals complete a jolting likeness of the famous sign in the Hollywood hills.  Henry's walk home, the puddle, and the wet sock are simply a `deus ex machina' leading to this shot.It turns out that the radiator plays a major role &#150; it is home to the only semblance of entertainment in the whole movie.  (In a way it takes the place of a television set in the apartment.)  In its next appearance the radiator opens onto a stage, and later a dolled-up girl comes onstage to sing and dance.  The song is a caricature of Hollywood  `In Heaven, everything is fine!/You've got your good things, and I've got mine.'  Eventually this becomes  `...you've got mine,' pointing to Hollywood's seductive use of glamour.The indication is that Eraserhead is about Lynch's struggle with Hollywood. Like Henry, the director is an outsider (with respect to Hollywood at this point in his career), and the baby seems to represent his movie.

The film is set in a deserted town, probably Pennsylvania or Ohio, where industry is rampant and there is a constant thunder of machinery and whistles. The films main character, Henry Spencer, is a depressed and totally passive supergeek who lives in a retro 1920's style apartment and generally has no life to speak of. He receives a  phone call from his girlfriend to come have supper with her and her family, also very dysfunctional. There is constant tension brimming between him and her mother and she reveals that there is a baby, and that they are to marry. The baby is a totally mutant offspring that looks like a baby ET. Henry's girlfriend deserts him and he is trapped with the child, begining his descent of hallucinations of a chubby cheeked woman in white and sex with his prostitute neighbor across the hall. I won't give the rest of it away. I bought a used copy of it in the late 1980's after seeing it as a midnight film. Apparently, the video version hasn't been produced in years and is rather inferior, as it was made in black and white and is very dark. Even by Lynch standards, this is one weird movie. Just to name a few things Henry has a bowl of water in his dresser and plops a coin in it for no apparent reason, Mary's grandmother is seated in the kitchen and catatonic, there's 2 different ovens in the kitchen, a clock with only one hand, no automobiles, etc. Recommend for cult film buffs only "},{"Title":"The Ultimate.........","Date":"30 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Without a doubt, my favorite Lynch film.

This was David Lynch's first serious film. It's set in some sterile, dark city which may or may not be in the post- apocalypse future.I first heard about Eraserhead five years ago when I saw an article about it in the newspaper. The news that Eraserhead had just been released on video. What really caught my attention was the photo of Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) looking like he was in a trance, his hair sticking up wildly.The story (if story is an appropriate word) follows the fortunes of Henry Spencer, a solitary, reticent printer. One night he visits his girlfriend Mary and meets the rest of her family. Mary's mother then drops a bombshell. Henry is a father. Normally, a man might be overjoyed by such news. But the child Henry has is no normal child...Eraserhead is sometimes very hard to watch. Paradoxically, you can't take your eyes off it either. You can't always tell when Henry is awake or dreaming, and this can be disorienting. In the background there is the constant noise of machinery. Organ music adds an extra layer of strangeness. I didn't find Eraserhead as disturbing as I expected. Sometimes it made me laugh. My parents hated it. I love anything with a touch of the bizarre, and Eraserhead is, in all sense of the word, bizarre.You may need a bit of patience to appreciate this film. There are long gaps between dialogue, characters take ages to go into action. But the film is a worthwhile experience.

He told us the way we are living is just one single way, it is like telling us don't stick to your safe warm and cosy feeling of realism, go and seek the other ones!So you can only appreciate ERASERHEAD if you try to think in a absurd-logic way.  However, if you do, you'll love this film.On the other hand, artists create beauty.  Although I haven't seen the film in quite some time, I can still remember and enjoy some specific scenes. These scenes often wander in my mind and make my day.  Imagine this walking during a cold rainy winter day in a grey anonymous city while singing 'In heaven, everything is fine'.

That Eraserhead would be listed in the notorious company of Cannibal Holocaust and Combat Shock was quite surprising, and initially I felt nonplussed that such an obviously serious and artistic statement was listed alongside bottom-of-the-barrel exploitation trash like Man Behind the Sun (although, to be fair, Pasolini's Salo and In a Glass Cage were also on the list -- these are films I personally detest, but they do at least have artistic value).  However, I was hard pressed to find a reason why Eraserhead wouldn't qualify for this list.  It is certainly the most convincing portrayal of a nightmare ever put on film.  Like a nightmare, it has its own logic, which doesn't seem open to question while the film is playing itself out.  Afterwards, like the afterimage of a nightmare, one doesn't fully understand what transpired, but knows that it made sense while inside of it.  And that, to me, is what lifts Eraserhead above the pretentious hackwork that many claim it is.  Unlike Lynch's Lost Highway, this one doesn't break its own rules.I don't believe that this film holds any answers whatsoever, but that its meaning is whatever you choose to make it.  Because the film is completely nonlinear, any assertion made about its symbolism could be inverted -- the opposite could also be true.  Although I still don't know what to make of those man-made chickens......As a postscript  I don't want to start any little wars here, but to smugly proclaim your interpretation of the film to be the correct one and to accuse anyone who didn't like the film of utter ignorance is no more intelligent than claiming the film was stupid in a review where half the words are misspelled.

His theme appears to be that of masculine responsibility (and the fears that this can evoke).  Lynch climbs into the souls of men and tries to explain what we are (this is sometimes interpreted as misogyny) and why we do the things that we do.  He tends to deal with men in crisis and to show us what our reactions are to these crises, on  a very abstract level.  Eraserhead is about the ultimate male responsibility, that of a man to his child (although we are never really sure if the baby is Henry's, he assumes responsibility).  As Henry tries to work out his anxieties and fears through dreams, imaginings and actions, we are taken along.  Ultimately, Henry fails and we see the consequences of his actions (the world blows up), but this is not meant to be taken literally, it is meant to be viewed as a metaphor about how men feel about responsibility.  Lynch always portrays strong male characters, who often fail or get into situations that are over their heads, but try to cope with them regardless.  Eraserhead is simply the outline for all of Lynch's later works. "}{"Title":"The thinking man's movie.

I was so nervous that I'd hate the movie but I LOVED IT!Just a warning to those of you who haven't seen this Lynch masterpiece yet. Don't watch it unless you are ready for a horrific and mind blowing experience. This movie makes you think and I feel that anyone who would dismiss this film as 'garbage' or 'dumb' doesn't care to put on their thinking caps while watching a flick. I guess some people just want to watch movies in which they don't have to think and everything is layed out for them on the screen. I pity them.First of all I want to say that the cinematography was excellent in this film and so was the acting by Jack Nance. Lynch's use of the industrial noise soundtrack I think was brilliant and made the world this film is set in much more bleak and horrific.Eraserhead is a film of symbolism and thats why I dig it so much. Henry's wife, the baby, the woman across the hall, the woman in the radiator and the things she steps on, the brick wall view, the elevator........all symbolize something. What do they symbolize? That's for each of us to decide. Lynch just didn't put these images on our screens for his own enjoyment. He wanted us to think. He wanted us to ask, what the hell am I watching? why does the baby look like that? who is the woman in the radiator? what is wrong with Henry's girlfriend and her parents? why is the film called Eraserhead? what happened in the end? Maybe David Lynch knows the answers to these questions. But his answers are his answers only. If Lynch wanted us to know what the symbolism meant to him he would have just explained it to us. He would've laid it all out on the screen. But he didn't. I think that Lynch wants all of us to come up with our own answers. Otherwise, why wouldn't he have told us his?Like Kubrick's 2001, Eraserhead will not be liked by all who see it nor has it been. I feel however that if you keep an open mind, and are ready to use your mind and decipher the nightmare-ish imagery in the film you will probably like it. Don't get me wrong though. Even if you love it you will not watch it again right away. I loved it and I don't plan on rewatching it for a while. Besides having to endure disturbing scenes all over again (the wife rubbing her eye, the final act of Henry with his baby and the after effects, the dinner at his in-laws), I don't think the human mind could handle seeing Eraserhead more than once in a day! Or even in a week! So in ending my rambling If you haven't seen Eraserhead see it! And if you have seen it and didn't like it, rewatch it with an open mind. And if you have seen it and did like it, recooperate a bit and then watch it again. I'm sure you'll pick up on some more things on the second go around.

Art-house at its finest.","Date":"8 February 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  David Lynch suffering from depression, and the confusing emotions that a new parent suffers, on finding out that their new-born has a deformity (a clubfoot in this case), formulated these feelings into one of the most startling works of cinematic art. Filmed in low-budget, grainy black and white. With a pulsating and throbbing industrial noise soundtrack. The film starts as it means to go on, throwing image after surreal image at the viewer, for the viewer to interpret as they wish. Lynch knows the score, he knows how personal art like this is. It is not for the film-maker to tell his audience what he thinks it's about, it's up to the audience to work on it themselves. In this way Eraserhead can be seen on so many different levels. I personally felt the emotions of the confused X - beautifully played by Lynch regular Jack Nance. I saw the world, for eighty minutes through his eyes, his scared young eyes. Nothing makes sense to the put upon young father anymore. He was emotionally stunted to begin with, but is now presented with a world that is unrelatable, paranoid and lonely. Every character in the film has a problem communicating, whether it be the crazed mother-in-law, who attempts to molest 'X' after dinner; or the mysterious 'woman across the corridor', who cuts a perfect picture of loneliness. Ultimately it is 'X' rapid decline into fantasy, as seen in the running dream of 'the lady in the radiator', and his doomed affair with the 'woman across the corridor', that brings the sexual and emotional repression to a head. The 'baby' then becomes a hate object, a thing so hideous that it cannot be touched. It also acts as a mirror to the young 'X' as he see's it's repugnance, as a further sign of his own irredeemable awfulness. Not since 'Stroszek', has a film captured what it means to be genuinely alone in the world. For such a bleak film, full of inventive imagery, the one image that always stands out in my mind, is that very first shot of the young 'X' walking through the desolate wastelands of an industrial hell. That in itself captured the very essence of modern urban life. A brilliant, but flawed movie. In years to come I'm sure it will feature more and more as an item of study.

Unlike what most people believe, it's not such a strange film. What makes it look strange is the preconceptions inside the viewers' heads about what an ordinary film should look like. I see Eraserhead as Lynch's Citizen Kane, for the following two reasons it's his first feature film as well as the best film he has ever made (although some of his next ones came pretty close) and it was made with total disregard to the storytelling rules of the mainstream. It borrows from genres such as German Expressionism and the Avant-Garde, but combines them to create a masterfully structured new approach that remains faithful to its inner logic. I would have to go back to the silent films in the beginning of the century in order to find a movie that has such a strong feeling of trying to figure out what cinema is capable of. In my mind the strangest thing about Eraserhead is how can people burst into laughter while watcing Henry and the baby at the ending? It felt like being inside a David Lynch film.

But I think Lynch, as soon as waking up from one, wrote down its particulars.Maybe in a diary that he kept (talk about a labor of love). I can just picture him telling people Wow. What a whacked-out dream I had last night. There was a grossly deformed woman living inside my radiator, dancing on a stage where fetuses were dropping on the floor. She would use the heel of her shoe to crush them. Yikes. There was another commentator on this site who said that the film has a dated look to it. ????? It features nothing that one would associate with the mid-to-late 70s. There is no Disco, or its accompanying fashion(s)--certainly not the clothes and hairstyles among any of its characters. There aren't even automobiles,graffiti- ridden subway cars, etc, that allow you to identify the time period. In short, you really have no way of knowing that this film is nearly four decades old. And people are still talking about it.In sum, it's like Rob Zombie said in an interview a little while back. He noted that it is over forty years later, and people to this very day continue to debate/interpret this motion picture, Night of the Living Dead,and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

He must deal with not only a temperamental girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), but the supposed offspring of their union a worm-like mutant child whose incessant wailing drives the mother mad. It looks like Henry desperately needs some sort of reprieve from his overwhelming existence.Filmed in beautifully stark black & white by cinematographers Herbert Cardwell and Frederick Elmes, Eraserhead marked the arrival of filmmaker David Lynch in a major way. This debut has a potent and nightmarish quality which drew this viewer in from the beginning. The sometimes disturbing and gross visuals are telling the story just as much as any narrative. In fact, there isn't much of a narrative here, but a series of images tying together that film buffs can have fun trying to analyze.The atmosphere is bleak but lovely right from the start. The acting is just right in all of the major roles. Lynch favourite Nance is a striking lead. Allen Joseph adds some offbeat (than again, what about this film *isn't* offbeat?) humour as Mary's father. Jeanne Bates, Judith Roberts, and Laurel Near co-star; Lynchs' daughter Jennifer has a small role, and that's Darwin Joston of Assault on Precinct 13 fame as the front desk man at the pencil factory.The use of music is haunting, but what really got to this viewer is the sound design, by Lynch and Alan Splet. In fact, Lynch wore a lot of hats on this show director, writer, producer, editor, production designer, and art director. Catherine E. Coulson, the future Log Lady of 'Twin Peaks', was Lynchs' assistant director and assistant camera person. Listed among the special thanks are Sissy Spacek and her husband, veteran art director Jack Fisk; Fisk has an acting role here.Both unforgettable and unpredictable, Eraserhead truly got under this viewers' skin.Eight out of 10.

His angry girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) has recently given birth to a strange deformed mutant baby, that cries constantly to the point where Mary is driven insane. She leaves and Henry is left to take care of it. I won't say anything else because from then on is just strange imagery everywhere. There's a scene where Henry's head falls from the sky, a child finds it on the ground, takes it to a pencil factory, and it is made into erasers. This scene could have been left out of the movie and nothing about the plot would change. If David Lynch wanted to make a story he could have gone without 40 or more minutes of this. But making a story wasn't Lynch's only goal. You can see that he wanted to make a surreal and engrossing film. I'll have to watch this again many times before I learn what it's trying to say. But I'll have good time when that happens because this is a great movie. If you can take strange and deranged cinematography then you'll probably be able to take this.

It was my first time experiencing the film and being a huge fan of David Lynch (my new favourite director) you can only imagine how excited I was. It's now half past eleven in the morning and Eraserhead is still whirling around in my very own head. The film is extraordinary. I've seen my fair share of weird films, from Jan Svankmajer's Conspirators of Pleasure to Lynch's very own Inland Empire, but somehow Eraserhead manages to surpass them both in the weirdness department. Indeed, Eraserhead is probably the weirdest film I have ever seen. It's pure Lynch and pure art. It's a film which you could not put into words; it's something you have to experience for yourself.When the film was over, my sister and I sat there in silence as the credits rolled up. My heart was thumping quickly and loudly. I felt utterly horrified by what I had just watched. I was drained and could hardly walk in a straight line afterwards. I don't get scared very often at all, but Eraserhead actually did frighten me. Its atmosphere is choking, unsettling and disturbing. The images are stuff you wouldn't even be able to find in nightmares.Your enjoyment of Eraserhead is partly down to how you view it. If you watch it in broad daylight with kids running around and not paying too much attention to it, then you're not going to like it. You're going to think it's the biggest pile of shitake you've ever seen and I wouldn't blame you for saying that! To fully experience Eraserhead (and with every other David Lynch film) you must immerse yourself in it. Watch it alone, in the dark, with the sound turned up and an open mind then you will experience something truly unique.The film is virtually plot-less. Or at least it seems that way when you first see it, but I'm convinced that if you dig underneath all the bizarre symbolism then you will find something quite rich and astonishing. It resembles a feature length version of one of David's shorts, especially The Grandmother and it's all the more better for it. I didn't feel like I was watching a film at all, rather I felt like I was having a nightmare. It didn't even feel like I was watching a nightmare. It felt like I was literally having a nightmare! Eraserhead is scene after scene of bizarre and incredibly frightening imagery. It's enough to make a person go insane.David Lynch's directing here is as amazing as it has ever been. He creates a chilling atmosphere with the use of a droning industrial soundtrack which is excruciating to listen to at times. He also makes incredible use of a slow pace and startling black and white photography which has an eerie beauty about it. It's a seriously depressing atmosphere and it's one which will stay with you for a long time after seeing it. The dream-like quality of the film is astonishing. When the lady in the radiator started singing I felt disturbed, bewildered and transfixed all at the same time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the duration of the film.It also feels like it's on for an eternity when you're watching it and I don't mean that in a bad way. It enhances the nightmarish quality as when you have a dream it feels like you're there forever, but when you wake up you can only remember bits. Eraserhead is exactly like this. It's a nightmare captured on film and confirms David Lynch as a master of cinema. His films are unlike any other and they manage to affect me in such a deep manner. I was shaken when Eraserhead had finished and it brought back memories of when I saw Inland Empire for the first time.Having said all this, Eraserhead is not a film for a mainstream audience. Not everyone will 'get it' and I wouldn't blame you if you hated it. Strange doesn't even begin to describe Eraserhead. All I know is that it's a masterpiece. It's a piece of timeless art that was way ahead of its time and still very much is. You'll see the world in a different way when you've finished watching it and every other film will seem dull and conventional. Eraserhead will stay with me for an extremely long time and is an experience I will never ever forget. Roll on Blue Velvet!

Eraserhead is the kind of film where you can analyze it for years and still you wouldn't be 100% sure. Watch it with ten of your friends and you'll get different opinions and interpetations.

It takes you out of your movietime comfort zone. And I liked it. So I continued watching. Eraserhead is terrifying in such a way that it takes you in, unsettles you, includes you in Henry's nightmarish world, and fascinates you with it's striking visuals and camera shots, unnerves you with the grating almost mechanical musical score, and keeps you intrigued with its two lead stars Henry and the baby. I sat and watched, fascinated & unnerved at the same time, not wanting to see the ugliness of it all and yet I know for sure that I will watch this again as soon as possible. And therein lies this film's beauty. Really not for everybody.... But I suggest you watch it if only to see Jack Nance's enigmatic facial expressions and cool hairstyle.

Up until this point he had made several short art films that had a heavy surrealist influence. Eraserhead is also an art film too. Its imagery and audio are intense, while its plot-line is pretty seriously far removed from any conventional ideas of traditional cinematic story-telling. In order to appreciate it, you need to be able to connect more with the rhythm and feel of the film, rather than try to understand its logical meaning. It's because audiences are unconsciously trained to expect the latter when watching films that many feel alienated from this movie. It's understandable of course as this is not an easy film in any sense. Not only is it not easy to interpret but its pacing is very deliberate and slow with a tone that is quite disturbingly down-beat. It probably doesn't really need to be said but Eraserhead is certainly not a film for everyone.The protagonist is a man called Henry (played by Lynch regular Jack Nance) who lives in an unspecified, bleak dystopian world. He and his girlfriend have a baby who is hideously freakish. We observe the nightmarish world that surrounds the passive Henry.In the world of Eraserhead things continually aren't what they seem, even if on the surface they look quite normal. Ordinary items such as radiators have the power to disturb. Lynch seems to have a skill in presenting everyday items in such a way that they take on a sinister veneer. It's a feature of his films overall but it was here where it was first so evident. In the logic of Eraserhead worlds exist within worlds and behind the radiator in Henry's room lives a grotesque character called simply the Lady in the Radiator. She performs on a small stage and sings about how 'in heaven everything is fine'. It's sort of like the type of strange worlds that little children wilfully invent to amuse themselves &#x96; but it takes a confident artist to bring such an abstract idea to the screen is so committed a fashion.While Eraserhead's fantasy world was not one Lynch would immerse himself in so fully ever again, there were many aspects of this film that he would never abandon. The chief being the specific way in which he interlinks the visual with the aural. The sound design is just as important as the images on screen; the audio assaults the viewer just as intensely - the constant wailing of the baby, the repetitive industrial noise outside and the low hum of the soundtrack. The dialogue, too, works in a similar way. It's very sparse and deliberate, even sometimes funny. In such an intense film Lynch does have strangely comical moments such as the squabbling pencil makers or the somewhat uncomfortable family dinner scene. Bizarre humour is after all another less commented upon feature of the director.Whatever you think of Eraserhead &#x96; and many will hate it &#x96; it has to be admitted that it's a one off. The product of a very unique mind. Many have interpreted it in various ways and while some ideas do make some sense such as it being a reflection of Lynch's fears of impending fatherhood, I think it's only fair to surmise that this is essentially a pretty impenetrable movie; one that has to be felt more than it should be understood. If you can get into its specific rhythms you could really appreciate it.

And who hasn't experienced this situation upon meeting the parents?!? The film's own ridiculous ludicrousness brushes against truthfulness and the essence of art&#x97;its pervasive preposterousness reveals the inner workings of appalling (yet genuine) feelings. As if darkness were turned outside in and downside up, the certain and utterly desolating and isolating consequences of toying with societies black holes are all-encompassing. This dearth of anything remotely healthy inexorably grounds these characters towards a fate as apprehensively unpredictable as it is inevitable&#x85;. If the film is shocking, so are the repressed thought-emotions that fuel its repulsiveness. Rather than simply concluding that such imagery and dialog is the result of some disgusting dream, it seems more accurate to say that ERASERHEAD can lead the viewer to a new state of awakening. The kind of waking up that forever precludes the blessed change to a sleepy and gentle state of mind. The kind of eternal awakeness that cannot be altered, understood, or endured.

The soundtrack was the first thing that really tipped me off that 'Eraserhead' was going to be a different experience of a film. The harsh noisescapes permeating the background at nearly all times is cacophonous, and the black and white images make it seem like a really long music video for a modern day noise artist. David Lynch did the music himself, which I thought was really great.The film at times reminded me of the silent classic 'Nosferatu' with all those eerie shots of Jack Nance reminiscing Count Orlok. I read here on IMDb that Stanley Kubrick would make the cast of 'The Shining' view 'Eraserhead' in an attempt to get them in the right frame of mind that Kubrick wanted, and I can definitely see that.My initial thought interpreting the meaning of the film, and I use the word meaning lightly, was that the entire thing was just one long nightmare, but who can say for sure?

This poor guy whose head sticks up like the pink eraser on the end of a pencil (Jack Nance) lives a shabby life in an industrial setting. He has to put up with a shabby girl friend who takes up all the bed and leaves him on the edge with only a blanket full of holes. She clacks her teeth while sleeping and when she rubs her eye the sound is that of a finger rubbing an inflated balloon. He has to put up with a mutant baby with the ugliest tiny head since the monster's in Alien -- and when the infant gets sick, the head bursts out in pustules.But there's no real narrative line to describe and none for a viewer to lose. I think maybe what David Lynch was doing was pretty ambitious an attempt to create a Gesamtkunstwerk on a minuscule budget, a fusion of images and sounds and a trip through the time line that all need to be taken together, grasped and appreciated as a whole.I would judge that he succeeded on his own terms. That is, what Lynch has put on the screen is pretty much precisely what he wanted to. The least we can say about it is that it's consistent. Everything we see or hear is itchy or slimy. If Lynch wants to break off from what skeletal story there is and dissolve to a woman wearing an overblown blond wig, standing on a stark stage, and singing In Heaven, Everything's Alright, backed by shimmering dissonant organ chords, he does it. And if he wants to insert a shot of a drifting meteor, he does THAT. He doesn't ask anybody. He just goes ahead and DOES it.That's okay. A chaque a son gout. The problem is that Lynch's notion of what's interesting -- forget about beautiful -- may not correspond to that of anyone else. It certainly doesn't overlap with mine, although it seems to have struck a resonant chord in many others.I couldn't have more respect for a director than I do for David Lynch. I was an atmosphere person in Blue Velvet, which, to my surprise, turned out to be a great film in many ways, as was The Elephant Man. He was behind the camera for eighteen straight hours for one scene and looked wrecked. I doubt that commercial considerations occupy much of his life space.The impression I get here, though, is that Lynch was testing reality, asking himself and his producers just how far he could drop down the rabbit hole and get away with it. He got pretty far down.His later work was, in my judgment, an improvement -- still weird, still a cinematic tribute to textures -- but linked to a structure that we can grasp. A better balance between the formless and the rigid. People whose intentions and character we can empathize with. When Jack Nance begins to pull out these repugnant things from his girl friend's body, one placenta after another, and flings them away in disgust, why doesn't he get up and run like hell for the police? It's Lynch's vision and he gets all kinds of bonus points for originality. Nobody had ever done anything quite like this. The closest thing I can think of is slitting a goat's eyeball open with a razor in Un Chien Andalou and that was back in 1929 and Luis Bunuel had to drag in Salvador Dali.Actually, a movie like this would prompt me to wonder what, exactly, was going on in the writer/director's head. There is a rich hint of psychosis. Yet David Lynch himself, when he appears in interviews, is always dressed in a sports coat with a shirt buttoned up to the neck. When he speaks, he sounds perfectly reasonable, like a guy behind a drug store counter.Well -- if it helped him find his footing....

I couldn't follow the story because there was none, I couldn't understand the characters because they were not human, but if the goal was to freak people out, and it probably was, the mission has been accomplished as far as I'm concerned. Some of the most bearable (pre)Lynch material, quite a lot of genius in it.

It's a fascinating film, but not one I can say I necessarily enjoyed watching.All of Lynch's fever dream movies are open to interpretation, so I can only say what I took from this film personally. To me it was entirely about the fear of responsibility and the potential stagnation that comes with domestic married life and fatherhood. The baby in this film is literally a creature from another planet; it's threatening not because it's evil or menacing itself but rather because it has needs and wants that it has no clear way of communicating and which its father doesn't entirely comprehend. The film manages to capture in images and sounds the kind of abstract thoughts and fears that lead men into mid-life crises.It's a difficult film to summarize or even describe, other than to say that it lingers in the brain and is amazingly unsettling to watch.Grade A "},{"Title":"Got patience?","Date":"12 July 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Ah, what can be said about a movie that is confusing, slow, and yet followed by a rabid, obsessive fan base? Quite a lot, actually. I for one, did not appreciate this movie as others did. While it is black and white, the lighting is poor and at times I found myself asking, Is that the carpet, or something I should be looking at? or Why does he have a pile of dirt on his dresser? Spots of dialog are few and far between, and made very choppy by the actors reciting them. Many things in the movie remain unexplained, though I assume that over half of it is some form of bizarre imagery. Unless you are of a weak heart, this film won't scare you, though it may cause your stomach to churn from utter disgust as did mine. (Don't eat anything slimy or wet, anything at all during this movie. Believe me, you'll know when you watch it.) So my opinion is this Eraserhead is an adequate film, with an adequate (though confusing plot) and adequate acting. Its good for a laugh, simply because of the stereotypical character of the boss.

Since the great train robbery? Since the kinetoscope? What is film's purpose? What does this have to do with eraserhead? Nothing. Everything. Something in between?A lot of synopses I have read attempt to explain what this film is or means. What it means is only as clear as the viewer's prejudice and subjective perception enables that viewer to see. I have studied film and literature and taught at University. What do I think that enables me to have? A more erudite subjectivity perhaps. Or a more westernized idea of what is going on. What seems to be going on is time moving circuitously collapsing on some sort of religious/industrial idea of linearity. A solipsist nightmare perhaps in that we are all solipsists because that is all we can know in the end. There are many ideas of dreams present in the film. Dreams being interspersed with waking realities give me the idea that there are similar functions as that of lost highway at work here. I read one comment that said this film was art and it must be looked at in that way. I do not know what exactly is meant by this differentiation of art from film, as if they are separate-as if oranges and fruit are divergent species. One is merely a subclassification. Like other visual arts however, if one looks at this film from different angles, as if it were a piece of sculpture perhaps, or rather, not concentrate on what are given to us as the main focal points i.e. henry, mary x and her x family, the baby, the landlady etc. other things seem to be going on. What importance these other things have is left up to the individual's own god complex to figure out. Or, more simply put, I think folks need to stop wondering what this and that means, as if it means anything at all. What if it doesn't? What if it never has or will? e.g. Kurtz's horror in conrad's heart of darkness. There is an idea of absurdity, as in ionesco's rhinoceros. What is this thing or that thing doing here? it normally does not appear here? yet we use only 6% of our brains. perhaps we were meant to eat other foods and just do not know it. There can be seen several symbols. And if one looks hard enough, one can even make some up that are not even there! Mary X-is she a virgin? Did henry and she have sexual intercourse as mary's mother asked? if they did not, how did the child come to be? View the pencil as if it is Henry himself. one end negates the other. Does this have meaning? why is there always the need for some great moral? answer? to prove, to hope even, that morals do indeed exist. but this is not my idea of what is going on in the movie. I do not think anything is actually going on or that it has any real meaning, as in g.g. marquez's magically realistic tales told to him by his grandfather.

There are several reasons for this, and I guess it all starts with the intentional lack of human touch and positive emotion. This alone gives it a sour, metallic taste. Add to this a mix of darkness, visceral and venereal horror, and that's it - if you think you're going to see a regular movie, you've got another thing coming. This movie has a very vague resemblance with Cronenberg's Videodrome (and Crash, why not). Lynch's movies refuse to explain themselves and leave one with the pleasure - or burden - to do so. I reckon Hollywood fans will be pretty mad because no one tells them what happened and how to feel about it.

Eraserhead was an experimental film by the genius director David Lynch. Everything about it is repulsive, horrifying, disturbing, and yet there is beauty in how it all works so well. This is a very hard film to write a review on. Eraserhead isn't anything a film critic could analyze. The film is the way you interpret it(Spoilers) The world in eraserhead is a place where a man inside a planet pulls levers and there are horribly repulsive noises. A world where a paranoid man named Henry lives alone in his apartment, across the hall from a beautiful girl, has a girlfriend who is part of the insensitive X family, is the father to a hideous mutant baby, and has a very strange looking lady lives inside a radiator. That's what the film is. There is no way anyone can possibly interpret what everything is really supposed to mean. The film is how you interpret it. You might absolutely love this film, you might be horrified by it, or you might absolutely hate it.

Well, it had quite a reputation to live up to there, and I can safely say it lived up to it. It lived up to it and then some.'Eraserhead' isn't merely weird &#150; it's also chilling, ominous, dark, sinister and certainly not for the squeamish&#133;or at least anyone likely to be intimidated by the sight of miniature roast chickens that writhe and bleed, women with monstrously puffy cheeks, overgrown worms, umbilical cords, dodgy pencil factories, and 'premature babies' that come up in boils and resemble a misshapen hybrid of a rubbery human embryo and ET. It combines its assortment of creepy and fantastical elements in a way that steers clear of the run-of-the-mill trippy and focuses instead on capturing the actual feel of a string of nightmares. As our protagonist 'Henry' drifts in and out of sleep, he experiences a series of horrific visions which presumably embody his waking fears and concerns. But just what exactly are these fears and concerns? Is it death he's so afraid of, or just fatherhood? And just where in this film do the nightmares stop and reality begin? These are all questions which arise throughout the picture and, as we've long since come to expect with the wily David Lynch, go completely unanswered. As per usual it's up to us, the plucky viewers, to draw our own conclusions. I have my theories on a lot of it, but there's probably an infinite number of interpretations out there somewhere.Whatever you choose to make of it in the end, it can't be denied that 'Eraserhead' is a brilliantly-made film, and it's no surprise to me that it found its cult appreciation soon enough &#150; even the more intense moments where the imagery completely repulsed me, I found it impossible to turn away. What makes it so effective comes largely down to its meticulous scenery and camera-work &#150; a slick combination of b/w shooting and murky, run-down interior settings that produce a world so bleak and colourless that escape and revival seem totally impossible. Furthermore, Henry's stunted interaction with the rest of the cast can't help but drag you even closer in. Often when they're looking at him, thanks to the positioning of camera angles, they appear to be staring directly at the viewer, or just past them, grinning menacingly or chanting ominous phrases like In Heaven, everything is fine. We may never fully understand Henry as a character, but thanks to these technical aspects we're almost forced to feel an affinity with him.If you haven't yet seen 'Eraserhead', and think you can handle the unease and grotesquery, then I'd strongly recommend it. It's one of those films that you may not even necessarily like as such, but still have to acknowledge what a great piece of craftsmanship it is in a league of its own &#150; a technical masterpiece that makes the most of its budget and limitations, generating exactly the unsettling atmosphere it aims for, and one of the most unique and challenging viewing experiences I've ever come across. What are the odds that you'll ever see another movie even remotely like this one?

I like to think I have relatively good and wide-ranging taste in films, but I can never get over the strange sensation that Lynch's career is some modern equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes. Finally, having seen the most recent complete waste of my time, his 1977 film Eraserhead (my fifth Lynch experience), I can conclude that the man needs to get a new day job.The reason I have tried to like him is that there are elements to his directorial style that I like. I like directors that put an emphasis on atmospheric sound/music, visual tension, surrealism, and for lack of a better term, trippy imagery. Lynch has all that, but he never fails to screw it up by going way overboard. His films, of which Eraserhead is probably the worst after the (unintentionally hilarious) abomination that was Dune, always give me the impression that I am watching the pretentious meanderings of a self-indulgent film student that some fool gave a few million dollars to.I have read criticisms of Jim Jarmusch which state that he is a Lynch wannabe, but in truth I think his film Dead Man exemplifies how to do right what Lynch always does wrong with his particular aesthetic tastes. Jarmusch is what Lynch would be if only he could reign himself in. I recommend Dead Man and Mystery Train for all those people that thought they might like Lynch but just couldn't sustain their enthusiasm. Almost structureless dull surrealism is how I would describe Eraserhead. Sound like fun you say? Not the way he does it. It largely reminded me of an almost impossibly boring acid trip. It had all the artistic merit of ten fat modern expressive dancers romping about on a stage dressed like McDonald's employees, to the sound of drilling noises. And it contained that level of logical progression too.Lynch has bounced his way through Hollywood like Forrest Gump on mescaline, with a bunch of deluded devotees -some of my good friends included- following behind, all probably arrogantly assuming that any detractors most likely enjoy Charles In Charge reruns. The sad truth is that given a choice between Charles In Charge and any more Lynch films, I would actually have to pick the former.I always feel like such a sucker when I go to see yet another of his excretions, but never again. DO NOT go anywhere near Eraserhead unless you believe that staring at jelly for long enough will eventually provide you with inner peace and satisfaction.

It is amazing how David is able to make ordinary things and items from every day life look so scary and menacing. It is impossible to say there is just one way to see this film or other films by Lynch so what I'm going to write is just my opinion and interpretation. It would be more than interesting to discuss these things with the director himself..Eraserhead works for me mostly on the level of its imagery and effects to create such a nightmare as it is. The film is pure nightmare from which you can awake only to even more frightening real world whatever it in Lynch's world is! I would see Eraserhead as a paranoid study of something taken over humans and controlling them. The menace may be for example the development of technology, which has become the enemy for its creators. Humans can't control their creations anymore, because they are being used (the eraser scene at the factory) by their own work. Also, there is a theme of humanity being totally lost and people being destroyed as there are many mutants and abnormal characters as the baby itself and the attractive singer in the radiator.The sound effects, imagery, little details (which are dozens again) and totally irrational storytelling have created one of the most impressive cinematic nightmares (not dreams, nightmares!) I've ever witnessed and so this can be described as horror experience, even though this is not just a horror film. Eraserhead is very difficult film and will never unfold to mainstream audience, because the film is too much for even some film buffs who can't understand and appreciate it at all. David Lynch is one of the most important artist in this field, and his surreal and unique work must be experienced many times and every time they will unfold more and you'll understand new aspects in them. These films should definitely be seen in movie theater, but unfortunately it is not always possible, so the home viewing experience should be made as intense and peaceful as possible.Unmatchable cinema, 10 full stars for the great film maker's early achievement.

The imagery is often overstated (like the point-of-view trip through the birth canal seen very early in the film, in which we find ourselves emerging, as it were, into Henry's nightmare world), but Lynch can be forgiven these excesses. His is the imagery of the subconscious, his approach abstract.

I only saw it once and that's enough, will probably never view it again, except maybe to impishly watch others reactions (will make sure I'm drunk, so I can laugh at their angst - can just hear their innards crying out, Existence is so pointless!)  Liked Lynch's Elephant Man and Wild At Heart much more.  As for Lost Highway, I admit I got lost with the confused Pullman somewhere on that winding road; and as for Blue Velvet, it was OK, perhaps a little overrated with Hopper playing his typicalcrazyself; my fave actor in that flick was Dean Stockwell, one strange dude!

Of the ones I've seen, I've enjoyed THE ELEPHANT MAN the most, perhaps because of the excellent performances by Hopkins and Hurt.  Though I found the scenes involving Merrick's mother to be a bit out-of-place in that film (and especially the final space-flight shot.  Seems like a man in the Victorian era would have no concept of movement through a starfield.) Anyway, onto ERASERHEAD.  I watched it because people told me it was the most original film of all time, and some even said the best.  While I believe that BLUE VELVET is a grossly overrated film, I feel that Lynch really makes an accomplishment here.  I didn't dislike this picture, really, and in fact was very impressed, at least on the technical levels.  Some of the shots were excellent, and even the puppetry was good. But what about the film?  I don't know.  It really does evoke some of the horrors of being alive, if not in a bit of hyperbole, but it reminds me of something that I can't seem to remember.  Lynch's statements here are nebulous, but that's not a bad thing.  The only thing that really makes me not love this film is that it lacks something that I find to be important in art subtlety.  I mean, I'm used to the idea of the insane world, both internal and external, and I prefer to see it portrayed in more stealthy ways.  But for the fan of surrealism, of grotesque, and of utter cinematic psychological horror, this is a well-done film.  So basically, I feel this is an acheivement, if nothing else, of style and craftsmanship, but not something I'd rave about.  Quite insane, though, and I do enjoy a bit of gorgonzola.

It's also the driving essence of the film - from the mechanical thrumm of the industry nearby, to the singing radiator and to the baby crying continuously.Against this aural assault, in the grimy black and white of Lynch's darkest psyche, lie layer upon layer of absurdities and creepy oddities. Setting the scene is the tiny, claustrophobic room that the weirdly- haircutted Henry Spence (Jack Nance) inhabits, along with all its creepy idiosyncrasies, like the radiator that sings to him.Henry's girlfriend, Mary X lives with him and Henry gives her a child. This creature, partly the alien coming out of John Hurt's stomach in 'Alien' and half 'Little Otik', the tree-based part baby, part log from the Czech semi-animated film of the same name, could compete as the ugliest single thing you've ever seen. And win, no question.It demands constant attention but Mary X is too emotionally drained to look after it and so leaves Henry with the little, VERY ugly mite. Then it gets some sort of disease which made it look ten times uglier and horrific. From then on, it just seemed to get more and more weird, with more and more disturbing images.From about a third way in, I was questioning not just whether I actually wanted to watch this film now, but at all. From two thirds on, one atrocious bit turned into another and like having an injection at the dentist, all I could do was to just hang on until it stopped. I certainly don't consider myself a wuss, or a prude and can watch almost anything but this endurance test was just a bit too much.I give three stars as it certainly is ground-breaking, very different and daring. And for a debut piece that had huge problems getting funding ($20,000 for only a 20 page script - that actually grossed $7,000,000 - not a bad return!) it has to be admired. I then deleted it from my TV service provider's box that I had recorded it from The Horror channel - as I never want to see it ever again! "},{"Title":"An existentialist masterpiece","Date":"20 January 2012","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Eraserhead is David Lynch's first full length feature film, made over three years with only $10 000. This is quite a effort as this film is much cheaper than Clerks and in a way is far superior. This film also launched David Lynch's career and he went on to make The Elephant Man, Dune, and Twin Peaks.The movie is very bleak and the synopsis is very strange. Des Managan did not bother to describe it, while a cult movie book wrote only a single line talking about its bleakness. It is not that the movie is not worth talking about though, rather the incredible intricacies of this movie leave it to the viewer to make his or her own interpretation. Des Mangan speaks of pointy headed intellectuals who try to push across a view point and says that he chooses not to go into a deep analysis as everybody is to make of this movie what they can. I will give a brief description of what I got from the movie, though I will touch upon aspects of another interpretation. I have included a link to a more detailed interpretation. I will simply look at what I see as the various themes in the movie One of the major themes in this movie seems to deal with relationship. Relationships form a major foundation of a lot of movies, and existentialist movies, such as this, show how fragile, or even impossible, they are. The main character, Henry, is alone in the movie. The impression you get from the first scene where he enters his flat is that he has no friends, and no true relationship. He is forced into a relationship through a pregnancy but this marriage is cold and emotionless, quite quickly it collapses with the wife walking out. It is not the attitude of Henry that destroys the marriage, but rather the baby that was spawned from the pregnancy. The baby plays a very major part of the movie; in fact it is the object upon which the whole movie revolves.To me, the spawn that is the baby symbolises the lose morality that destroys relationships. Though Henry at first does not admit it, we assume that he had sex with Mary and it is from this that the baby came. This seems to be a reaction against the loose morals from the sixties. The baby is thus a result of the destruction of the sanctity marriage. It is a baby born out of wedlock and thus is a freak, as such people are considered &#x96; the term bastard comes to mind. The baby itself is not evil, but it does drive Mary and Henry apart. Mary cannot take any more of it so she leaves, thus thrusting the responsibility upon Henry.This is another reaction against what the lose morals has created. Unwanted pregnancies burden people with unwanted babies, but generally only one person lands up with the baby, and that is usually the woman. Here the woman walks out leaving Henry with the baby, a corruption of what this world brings. Henry is the passive partner here where as Mary is the active. The roles of men and women are changing bringing a shift in the social order, and this is another idea that comes through. In this movie, the shift is complete, whereas in the 70's, when the movie was made, the shift was only beginning.Time has no meaning within this movie. Linear time does not exist and all the important events, such as the marriage, are squeezed out. In this movie, marriage no longer has any meaning, as such the wedding is ignored. The vowels mean nothing because Mary easily breaks them. The movie itself is not linear as we travel to a point where the marriage collapses, but after the marriage is still together. Further into the movie, Henry dies, only later to be alive. As such, linear time is not an important point in the movie and we are not to see it as such, rather the movie flows along a line of events. The importance of each of the events are put in order and thus the collapse of the marriage takes an earlier important, where a scene that occurs within the marriage takes its importance later. Thus the movie is like a retrospect, Henry looks back over his life and pulls the events into this order.The movie is also about the balance, one that can easily be over turned. A simple act of sex destroys the life of Henry. While Henry removes the baby's bandages at the end to discover that he has destroyed the delicate balance that held the baby together. Inside the baby is a living chicken, the same chicken seen during the dinner party at Mary's house. There the chicken was touched and it began spewing endless streams of blood; a similar thing happens with the baby at the end.Thus the idea of deceptions, and things not being what they seem, appears. The chicken appears dead, but is alive. The girl singer appears to be a girl, but really is a hideous man. She sings of heaven, a place you go at death, being a fine place, but the tone is dry and bleak, as if she does not really believe what she sings. Death does not bring happiness to Henry, instead he becomes an eraser. The meaning of life is nothing, but at least he makes a good eraser.

For better or worse, Lynch's vision is there in all its unadulterated completeness.Little wonder that other directors find the whole thing so attractive. However, a regular cinema-goer invariably approaches a film with no such envy and need give no particular credit for such 'individualism' (other than a bit of a nod for originality maybe).Personally, whilst I am always positive about original features in film, I thought that beyond the surrealism and bizarreness, 'Eraserhead' delivers very little.

My reasoning was that if THEY thought it to be genius then it must be crap. After all, these were the ones who laughed hardest at Americas Home Videos just because someone got hit in the nads.

Second, I did miss something but NOT for the reasons most pretentious reviewers will lie about. For one, the movie is interesting. It is campy and off the wall which is why I regret missing it so many years ago. Outside of that, I find no meaning whatsoever in the film. As I understand it, this film took over five years to make, however it was not due to the depth of meaning but rather the shallowness of funding. And after viewing, and bearing in mind the context of the time I can see why no one wanted to back its production. It would have only been of interest to either pretentious film students or pot smoking friends such as mine.Now to the bread and butter. Yes, I did like it. I liked it for the camp and bizarre awkwardness of the characters and sickness displayed. As for art, meaning and genius...not so much. Why? Its not there. Not even Lynch can or will explain it.

If I only had one word to describe this movie, it would be bizarre. One type of movie that I am always a huge fan of is bizarre, but this film took it way over the edge. It took the weirdness so far that it distracted from the plot which there was not much of anyway. David Lynch has gone on record as saying that no one has ever gotten the true meaning of the film and that he likes it that way.Jack Nance starred as Henry Spencer, a man living among many peculiar people, who must learn to survive after his child is born as a deformed mutant. In a very Stanley Kubrick manner, the first ten and a half minutes of the film were silent. Throughout the film, there were cut scenes of a woman with a deformed face singing and dancing. It was unclear whether this was a ploy to show Spencer's unraveling sanity or not; however, all I obtained from it was a very uncomfortable moment. To add to this, it has been reported that Lynch used a dead calf to portray Spencer's baby, making this movie all the more unsettling. It was shot entirely in black-and-white, causing it to appear much older than it really was.At the end of this film, I felt incredibly creeped out. It took disturbing to a whole new level but not in a good way. All of the characters had extremely strange mannerisms and some were just scary looking. This movie came out in 1976, so for the special effects to have spooked me is nothing short of impressive. If David Lynch was attempting to create a movie so weird and disconcerting that viewers do not understand the plot and get nothing out of the movie yet feel almost violated by the oddities, then he did a great job. When taking everything in the movie into consideration, it appears that maybe this was his goal. The black-and-white camera-work, the troubling storyline, the calf corpse, and the woman with the deformed and engorged cheeks singing all seem to come together solely to create the chills moving up your spine. After seeing this movie, George Lucas and Mel Brooks offered Lynch directorial positions, and Stanley Kubrick even named it as one of his favorite movies. Lynch turned down Lucas's offer of directing Return of the Jedi, and instead directed The Elephant Man, which Brooks had presented to him.In conclusion, all I can say is that I would not suggest this movie. At all. I respect Lynch's first attempt at a full length movie, and I saw several redeeming directorial attributes throughout. As I said above, his camera work and lack of dialogue remind one very much of Stanley Kubrick and cause you to focus much more on the character's actions and mannerisms. He also seemed to very successfully show you things without explaining them (i.e. the deformed woman singing), which is always useful in making a movie more thought provoking as it inspires the viewer to contemplate meanings behind visual sequences. So, if you are a fan of having to think very hard about what a movie means and being put off by some of the visuals, then this would be a great film for you to watch. Some would argue that it laid the stepping stones for some great psychological thrillers of this decade, such as The Machinist and Christopher Nolan's Memento. I will be completely willing to watch some of his other films, for instance Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive as they have received much better reviews overall. Despite all of these things, this movie was much too strange for my taste. It looks as if I may be mostly alone in this deliberation though.

I have also seen his somewhat more conventional movie Blue Velvet several years ago. I have wanted to see this film Eraserhead for over 20 years. I first heard about it when it was making the art house circuit in Portland, Oregon where I was a graduate student. It surpasses even Ingmar Bergman for essential weirdness in some of his films. With Bergman one chalks it up to Scandinavian angst and depression perhaps. (What would you do if the winters were so long and dark and you had nothing to keep you warm except Calvinist theology?) Maybe I am depressed myself, maybe that is the reason I was willing to sit through it. I have a theory that people who like weird and depressing movies are themselves depressed. There is something cathartic about watching movies featuring individuals going through horrific experiences. You begin to realize you own life ain't that bad.I guess that is the nature of Art and the visual artist seldom will put into words what in the world he was thinking when he made this or that work of art. It would be the ultimate spoiler and perhaps he couldn't do so if he tried. Can we explain our own nightmares or dreams without doing them an injustice? This is what happened in the movie (or so it seemed to me) (the spoiler part)It opens with Jack Nance (whom I guessed was Eraserhead because of his unusual hair) a fattish young man with frizzy hair with his foot caught on a dead desiccated animal stuck on a wire. He goes home to his dark depressing apartment, decorated by a dead plant sitting in a pile of dirt on a nightstand. Bare fluorescent bulbs light the room. His girlfriend's parents have invited him to dinner. He wanders through a landscape of howling industrial noise and steam pipes. At dinner his girlfriend's mother prepares the dinner which appears to be Cornish game hens. He is served one but finds that it bleeds profusely when cut into, and kicks its legs. Meanwhile Grandma is in the kitchen, can't or won't move her arms, (apparently catatonic) but is still able to have a cigarette.He and his girlfriend live in the same apartment and have had a baby which looks like something out of Alien or E.T. It cries constantly. The girlfriend can't stand it and since Eraserhead is on vacation she leaves the baby with him. Eraserhead goes to sleep and has a dream in which he sees this blonde woman with huge lumpy cheeks dancing on a stage, taking care to squish these worm-like creatures slithering about. She sings a little song with the words In Heaven, everything is okay Eraserhead in the dream approaches the woman and his head pops off and lands in the middle of the stage. Blood gushes from his beheaded body and then the Alien head grows up out of it. Lying in a pool of blood, his head suddenly gets sucked through the floor and lands outside in the street upside down. A little boy sees it and runs up and grabs it and takes it to a little shop where the attendant rings for the manager, who shows up and yells at the attendant. They then go into a side room. At this point Eraserhead wakes up. The thing baby is swaddled tightly and only its long slimy neck and its head show. Eraserhead takes some scissors and cuts off the swaddling to reveal its internal organs. The baby's insides start sprouting oatmeal and we fade to black.

If we were to believe that this film is nothing more than psychedelic fodder for abnormal or curious minds then we are discarding it, perhaps exalting it to an avant gard status. Is it just random imagery shown for shock value sake? Was David Lynch some goof ball in his youth that he was just some fool who embarked on a five year project, which isn't anything better than someone showing weird people and weird things just to discover what the reaction would be? Likely. But I think it's a bit of that and more.Eraserhead, in itself, is often boring, engrossing, drab, quirky, freakish and grotesque. The real crime here is that it absolutely refuses to explain itself and leaves you impatient and angry, but awaiting anxiously what will happen next. It's not suspense. Because suspense will clue you in to what will happen. In Eraserhead, you have no idea what will happen at the next moment. And we are at the beginning of our frustration with this movie. It has virtually no plot, minimal dialogue and just seems to venture into its own indulgent surrealistic voyage with uncompromising willfulness.But it somehow works through its convoluted logic. Yes, Eraserhead is a movie that will spawn reactions, both positive and negative. But this movie is likely to give art students ideas. And strange minds will likely be attracted to it. I happen to admire it. I don't admire it for its result, but rather the effort put into it. Any film maker should remark that a lot of effort and work went into this production, regardless of the budget. Five years is a long time and quite a sacrifice to have such a modest payoff. Lynch took a gamble with this movie, and I praise him for that. It is evident that after watching it we come across some elaborate sets and special effects.

And if you think that that explains the title, you're only just getting there). David Lynch's world is like nothing before it, introducing, with Jodorowsky's El Topo, 'the Midnight Movie', and while it influenced established directors like Kubrick, nothing has been committed to colloid since that comes close to what Eraserhead achieved in 1977. But behind the glass, soot and dirt and underneath its dream-like ambiguity hides a very simple film, with one simple theme. The fear of parenthood. Perhaps.In what might be reality or nightmare (or both) Henry Spencer (played by Jack Nance, who would go on to act in most of Lynch's films until his death in 1996) makes brilliant use of the sparsely written screenplay, delivering a solid performance based on almost the use of facial expression alone. And while he carries most of the film on his back, that's not to say that the supporting cast don't do a brilliant job too, Allen Job as Mr. X in particular adds an extra level of eccentricity to the already bizarre script ('We've got chicken tonight. Strangest damn things. They're man made. Little damn things. Smaller than my fist. But they're new. Hi, I'm Bill.') while Charlotte Stewart managers to deliver perfectly the most disturbingly enigmatic line ever-uttered in cinema ('Mother, they're still not sure it is a baby!') upon Henry's discovery that he is a father. But the real star of Lynch's sick show must be the baby. For Eraserhead to work Lynch had to, with the very limited budget he had, create something that perfectly captured Henry's disdain and confusion towards his newfound responsibility that came with his child. Here Lynch does not only accomplish this but he creates something so disturbing in Henry's premature baby that it will stay with you long after the credits role. Shaped like what one can only assume an aborted ET would look like, Lynch has remained typed lipped about how he created it since the film's release, but strong rumours suggest it was an actual calf foetus, adding even more to the thick air of mystery already surrounding the film. It's a testament to Lynch's skills that the baby is still as shocking today as when the film was first released.While a lot of people may dismiss Eraserhead for its lack of coherent narrative, this would be foolish, as even though the film relies heavily on Dali/Bunuel imagery and dream logic, it is far from the puzzles Lynch would later create (Muholland Drive, Lost Highway and INLAND EMPIRE in particular) and, in my mind at least, runs in a linear manner, thus making the understanding of Henry's decent into murder a little easier to understand then the study of some other surrealists. That's not to say that the plot holds one single, definite meaning, to one person Lynch's story maybe a tale of a man's decent into suicide, to another it's a study of life and death and what happens in the space afterwards and to a third person, a story of an alien visitor, lost on an alien world. The last one, metaphorically, maybe the closest to the truth.Lynch's characterisation and direction is flawless and Henry's situation in life is reflected perfectly in the slow camera movement and symbolism, most notably when we are shown the view from his bedroom window &#150; a brick wall. Like the baby there are certain images in Eraserhead that will stay with you for the rest of your life, the 'Beautiful Girl Across the Hall' and her and Henry's embrace in what appears to be a bath of milk, the bloodied stepping upon of giant sperm and of course Henry's head falling off and landing in a random street are but a few. The black and white visuals not only aid the nightmarish reality of Henry's situation and show off the brilliant lighting, but give the film such a timeless feel that it will still be the same experience for decades to come. This is helped tenfold by the fact that even though surreal, Lynch's film taps into the realist and strongest of human emotions as its run it's course to bloody climax and then stays with you for days where it, like The Lady in Radiator, draws you back, beckoning you back into it's world. In Heaven, everything is fine. Lynch's visual poetry exhibits what should be done in cinema, in a world filled with the generic blockbuster. It uses the medium to its full strength and in that sense Eraserhead demonstrates what film should be about, creating a piece of art that has only been possible since 1895 and is only possible with the power of a camcorder. It is pure cinema and a pure masterpiece. Whether you hate it or fall in love with it, there is no denying that Lynch's hypnotic imagery makes you feel as you've woken from the deepest dream/nightmare you have ever dreamt and for that experience it is worth viewing alone. But once you've seen it once, Eraserhead can only be seen again and again. And with a film as frightening, strange and alarming as this, that is a real achievement.

They treat it like a normal child &#150; feed it, talk to it, and the child acts like a normal one &#150; screams, gets sick and plays up. OK, it looks ugly, but it looks so to us, how do we know how it looks to them? Or how do we know, that we see what it IS, and not what Henry and his wife SEE it to be? The answer is &#150; we don't know that. The child is bald, big-headed and nasty. Babies are usually such. Or they are such to Lynch, Henry, etc. They didn't need that baby, didn't want it, it caused some troubles to their lives, it changed them for worse, it took their sleep away (actually, this list of pains all the babies bring) - they are definitely not happy with it, so it IS UGLY TO them.This dimension of the movie raises everyday life misfortunes and reflects social consciousness of some family issues. Everything that concerns society and social perception is more or less clear and familiar (like the marriage she -doesn't - want thing). But when it comes to personal visions and submergence you fall into the jack rabbit's hole. Talking about horror effect, the Lady in Radiator is brilliant. She is the most terrible and terrifying thing I have ever seen, but you like her! You can't take your eyes from her, she has a mesmerizing effect of some unknown power. It is disgust, shock, interest, confusion, acid in the mouth, fear, desperation, and paralysis that you feel all at once, almost physically in your body. Her song is just continuing what her dance started &#150; but now she gets the total possession of your mind &#150; the rhythm sticks to you and you can't get it off your head even hours later. In the end, I'd like to point the stunning work at spec effects - the baby is made perfectly, and you don't have a clue, how &#150; you can tell it's alive, a real alive repulsive creature. So, I can't say, that I liked the movie. Like wouldn't be the word, I don't usually like the movies like that. I don't really have a word for the feeling this masterpiece gives me. What is more, I can hardly call it a movie per se. It's rather a picture. Yes, an alive, moving picture by an artist of some Dadaist or Surrealist circle of the 30s. Now, I feel all the absurdity of a try to explain it &#150; surrealism, cubism, even impressionism, - you have to feel them. Once I had a discussion with a literate individual on Malevich's Black Square. After an hour of my speech, he says he still doesn't understand it, and won't understand it until he hears a SCIENTIFIC explanation. The moment he said that I knew I was wasting my time &#150; What a jerk, - I said to myself, - when on earth art needed scientific explanations?. The attempt to analyze Lynch now reminds me of that talk, and now it's me who acts like my thickheaded friend then. You can't catch the elusive. You can't UNDERSTAND it. You can only SEE it. That's why the Master himself never explained it &#150; because it's not for understanding, it's for seeing your own, unique eraserhead.

This early effort is difficult to follow like many of his other films (Lost Highway), is darker (Blue Velvet) and is patchy. Recently, I saw Mulholland Drive which is an awesome improvement on any other film he has made and one of the best this century to date. Eraserhead is more of a collage of disturbing images and sequences than most normal films with a free flowing plot and theme.I don't think Lynch had a premise with this film and wanted the audience to develop their own story from these images and and sequences. I didn't bother to conceive of what this film could mean. I didn't enjoy it enough it really was a waste of time viewing it, although some parts are memorable. I will never forget Henry and Marie's disfigured child or the dinner which moved and oozed blood. Why? Because it was both funny and shocking in its own way which is rare.I believe it is about lower class people losing their moral values, hope, faith and even sanity in a decaying society. The industrial setting, for me gave the film a British feel, I imagined it to be Manchester in the 1930s - 1950s.Overall the solution to this jig saw puzzle is don't take your anything you value in life for granted because life can be much worse. This is in hindsight, the film possessed no emotional stimulation and did not provoke any thoughts.

The monster baby is sooo creepy and disturbing, that it makes the viewing experience difficult. Until this day Lynch will never tell how the baby was created for the film. The story concerns Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a clergyman with a fro like hairstyle. He seems to be stuck in a bleak and dark environment of abandoned buildings and decayed streets. Henry enjoys a strange dinner gathering with his girlfriend Mary and her family. Well sort of, until the roasted chicken on the dinner plate comes to life. Then he finds out that Mary was pregnant and had a premature baby. O.K babies aren't too bad. But this is no typical baby. It's a hideous, crying, screeching embryo, penis type creature covered in bandages. Freaky!!! And of course who could forget the singing girl in the radiator. She sort of represents a peace of mind state. Eraserhead is full of strange images and was made when David Lynch was living in a slum section of Philly as an unplanned father. So the film seems to be symbolic for the fear of parenting. Watch Eraserhead with caution, because it will haunt you forever!

This is indeed one of the icons of cult movie making and one of my top 10.  The problem is that, it is almost unwatchable on first viewing.  It took me three or four tries to get through the entire movie back in the early 80s.  Also, I would not recommend anything except an excellent reproduction such as the Lynch DVD in order to make out all the details in the sometimes grainy B&W.  Thus rentals don't work out here.  If you are a committed fan of unusual films, give it a try.  What is the allure of this film?  First, it's dreamlike quality.  Second, Jack Nance's performance as the main character Henry.  Third, Henry's interaction with the baby, which moves from puzzlement to annoyance, then fear and finally extreme hatred.  Upon multiple viewings, it does start to exhibit its own logic, but insisting on this is like saying that a dream is only interesting if it makes sense.  Is it entertaining?  Yes, I reached that point somewhere around the 10th to 15th viewing.  This is a bit of a commitment.  Try watching Elias Merhige's Begotten first and Eraserhead won't seem nearly as strange.

Another great set of scenes is when Henry first gets treated to dinner at Mary's house.  Her smiling idiot father with the man-made chickens and bum arm is a comic gold-mind.  This is essentially a black comedy about a slightly disturbed young man's inability to deal with impending fatherhood and husbandhood and the effect that living in a decrepit urban hell (Lynch lived in squalor in the worst section of Philadelphia with his first wife and baby daughter while making this classic romp) has on his escapist fantasies (love that girl with the cotton candy cheeks singing in the radiator).

Jack Nance's Henry Spencer is the perfect schmuck, a guy whom nothing goes right for.  And in David Lynch's world, that is a very dangerous thing to be!  Here are listed a few of the humorous moments or incidents in the movie . . . .(SPOILER WARNING)The scene with Nancy X's parents is almost all humor (until the menstruating chicken at the end, that is), from Henry's approach (when he's scared by a barking dog), to the yelling of Mrs. X at her husband (Bill!), to the conversation (What do you do? Oh, I'm on vacation.), to the accusation and Mary's reaction (They're not even sure it is a baby!).The Erasherhead scene  this dream sequence is part disturbing, part humorous.  It gives me the biggest laugh of the movie, when the kid goes to the eraser factory or whatever it is, and the guy at the counter starts pushing that buzzer -- over and over and over!  Slam! the door opens and that big guy comes in, points his finger and bellows OKAY, PAUL!!!!  I still laugh when I think of that moment.The suitcase under the bed  when Mary leaves Henry, she tries to get her suitcase from under the bed, and has to yank for about 30 seconds before she gets it to come free.  Her pathetic frustration is really funny, as is Henry's reaction to her jerking the bed around.The seduction  Where's your wife? asks the woman from across the hall. I'm not sure.  I think she went back to her parents again.  The ultimate schmuck can't even keep track of his wife (though I think this part is another of Henry's dreams)!The sleeping with the new wife scene  her eye squeaks when she rubs it, and she hogs the bed.  Move over.  Move OVER!These are the most humorous parts of the movie to me.  Admittedly, the Lady in the Radiator, and the baby-thing, are disturbing and dark parts of the movie; the last scenes especially, with the baby-thing being stabbed and then mutating into a giant grotesquerie are the nightmare side of this dream.  But don't forget the humor!I must confess that I am a total David Lynch fan.  My favorite thing to say when talking about him is David Lynch is the greatest living American filmmaker.  I would say the greatest in the world, (living), but I don't see enough foreign movies to accurately judge if there's anyone better somewhere else.  Eraserhead, with its slow pacing (a style, or trademark, he would finally return to in Lost Highway and Mulholland DR), use of dreams and darkness, and emphasis on the dark corners of our existence, is the first of many masterpieces from David Lynch.Final note  I don't know if there is a DVD of this movie, but I have a laserdisc of it (a Japanese import), which is the best way to see this movie, as many of the darkest scenes (especially the one which seems to have been shot in almost total darkness, where Henry rubs at a piece of lint on his robe or pajamas) have poor contrast quality when seen on videotape. So look for that laserdisc if you are a Lynch fan (and get a laserdisc player, obviously, since there probably isn't a DVD of this movie -- though the Japanese might have made one; they seem to be the only ones who really realize, in a large way, what a genius David Lynch is).

You'll really, really love it, or you'll really, really, and I mean, really, hate it.Love might not be the right word.  I consider it an amazing film, but this is not a movie that one can exactly love.  ERASERHEAD creeps into you and does damage to you; the people who hate it don't just indifferently dislike it.  They genuinely resent this movie.  I saw one comment (which I feel safe in quoting, since many others will say this as well) which said that two hours of their life had been wasted on this film and they wanted it back.  I smiled in recognition, since a friend of mine had said exactly the same thing after watching it several years ago.As a personal opinion let me say that it is a worthy heir to the surrealist films of Dali and Bunuel, and has a focused intensity that even their collaborative films lacked.  (This is the purest, most focused work Lynch has done.  He has interesting passages in all of his films, but overall only BLUE VELVET comes close.)There's no point trying to intrigue anyone into watching this movie, so let me just say that you should be prepared for a slowly-paced film, that the black-and-white photography is inarguably beautiful, that the imagery is (genuinely; I can't think of another live-action film like it) unique, that the sounds are very unsettling, and that no matter what you think of it, you'll always remember it.

It makes the mistake of depressing and repelling you not because you identify or feel sorry for the characters in their crappy situation, but because it's such an ugly, stagnant, miserable, boring movie. It uses shock tactics without giving you a single good reason why you're being shocked. It tries to fake you into negative emotions without the movie backing up its intentions. I didn't feel as if I was watching this movie so much as being infected by it.It's set in a desolate and run down city in which Henry Spencer (John Nance) lives an unhappy existence. He steps in a puddle. Oh no. Isn't life tough? Henry mopes off to have dinner with his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) and her parents (Joanne Bates, Allen Joseph), where it's revealed that she's pregnant. On the menu are little chickens, which waggle their legs and ooze black goo in what I'm sure is a very meaningful way. Then Mary's mum licks Henry's face. Blimey, this must all add up to something. Pretty soon the baby is born, and it turns out to be a slimy mutant that cries incessantly. Then Mary packs her bags and heads home, leaving Henry with only the baby, his next-door neighbour and the lady behind the radiator for company. I checked the counter on my DVD player, and this stuff took about a month to happen. Here's the dialogue in one scene 'Was there any mail?' 'No.' That scene lasts for three days.Breathing space is fine, a slow burn is fine, deliberate pacing is fine. That's all fine. But there needs to be reason for it other than torturing your audience. 'Eraserhead' doesn't use silence and a slow pace to any particular end, it's just agonisingly slow. Shots will start with a dreary silence drilling into your head before anything happens, then end the same way. The nothingness hangs so heavy in the air that my neck started aching, then I got irritated, then I got angry. I can sit through a bad movie if I have to, but please, not one that grinds on like this. There is no reason whatsoever for the pace to be this slow. Shot after shot establishes itself, then just sits there, unchanging, for an unreasonably long time. I really hated this film. It took five years to make, and twice as long to watch. Both experiences were an astonishing waste of time.The direction of the actors borders on embarrassing, and their one-note performances cross that border. Everyone talks. Very. Very. Slowly. They move. Even. Slower. They take an age to say anything, and when something does eventually crawl out of their mouths, it's unutterably dull. There's a lot of staring. Nance has one expression, and he's not afraid to use it. His sucking-a-lemon brand of worrying starts grating after about, ooh, two minutes. The next door neighbour (Judith Anna Roberts), what's she there for? Not a lot, I'm afraid. As it all dragged on at this unbearable pace, with these tedious actors, it made me miserable. If it had made me miserable for some purpose, I could have lived with it. But all this misery, despair, moaning, bleakness - for what? A headache and irritation that ground my teeth to dust, that's what.I know I'm repeating myself, but let me just finish by repeating myself &#x96; 'Eraserhead' depressed and angered me because it's an amazingly boring, ugly, miserable, unbearable, overlong, grindingly slow dullard. This is the kind of film you want to plead with. Why are you so boring? How can you take so long to tell this story? Why should I care about a single thing that's happening?

Eraserhead is the sort of film that really does defy description or categorisation as it's one of a kind, not meant as a typical straight forward film with a linear story that can be understood easily Eraserhead is hard to interpret & seems like one long surreal dream full of symbols & metaphors for everyday life & it's the way you subconsciously interpret these images & metaphors that will ultimately decide how much you get from Eraserhead. Unfortunately for me I just thought Eraserhead was a random collection of seemingly unconnected weirdness that never came together in any meaningful way & if I have to think about the meaning or message of a film or even something as basic as what's it's about then the artsy symbolism & surrealist nonsense has probably gone over my head & as a whole the film wasn't obviously for me. For a film like Eraserhead to work you need to associate the surrealism & metaphors with something tangible & I didn't, I just thought Eraserhead was a mess of scenes & images that overall meant nothing to me.Maybe the single biggest cult film of all time Eraserhead is definitely worthy of it's notoriety, filmed in black and white with barely any dialogue & nothing in the way of standard narrative for an audience to grip onto Eraserhead isn't an easy watch. From piles of dirt on Henry's dresser to a bizarre scene where an old woman starts singing & dancing while giant sperm rain down which she them tramples to when Henry's head falls off & is replaced by his mutant babies to a general weirdness & unease that the not quite right normality it has. Apparently shot over five years as & when first time director Lynch got some money Eraserhead is amazingly well made considering it's low budget with a really crisp & clean look about it, sure it's weird but it's also stylish & nice to look at. Two years into filming original cinematographer Herbert Cardwell died in his sleep & was replaced by Frederick Elmes for the rest of the shoot.Shot on a budget of about $20,000 Eraserhead is incredibly well made with great special effects & some mildly gross-out scenes of mutant babies, decapitated heads & giant sperm. The acting is pretty good & quite intense although there's barely any dialogue & the character's are never fleshed out.Eraserhead is hailed as some sort of cult classic that I admit just went over my head, I thought it was a boring mess of a film with scenes of surrealist weirdness that to me didn't mean anything.

However the freakoid baby is too much for her, hence she jumps ship, and lets our hero take care of the munchkin (yeah... like that's a likely scenario). Soon after he goes crazy and turns into an eraser, cuz being a father does that to you. Plus his kid turns out to be full of porridge. And their a lady living in the heater.The film is wacky. Some would call it surreal and is mostly reminiscent of Luis Bunuel's (and Salvador Dali's) infamous Un chien andalou (surprisingly at the same time it also has the feel of the classical Ozu movies). It's closest living relative would have to be the music videos of Tool. But is being wacky, out-there, surreal enough to make this a masterpiece? In my humble opinion no. I do admire some of the sequences and visionary filmmaking, which to an extent was revolutionary and it has unnoticingly changed a lot as far as the art of film is concerned. It's influence on music videos is not to be understated, as the movie offered such detachment from logic, but at the same time supplied captivating visuals and atmospherics. And that was exactly what music videos required - minimum to no logical script, but maximum visual gratification.Admitedly not a great David Lynch fan, but I do admire the fact, that no-one has ever come as close to filming dreams as he has been. Surrealism probably does best designate his movies and The Lost Highway or Twin Peaks will remain great cinematographic experiences. Nonetheless even though Eraserhead has all the trademarks of a Lynch movie it overdoes the absurd, pointless and illogical. There is no semblance of reason and although the outworldiness of the script does necessitate sense and logic I found at times that even in the minimalistic surreal script plot holes were abundant (a father not knowing anything about his son's medical condition?).Additionally I find it extremely hard to grasp, why so many people call this movie disturbing, horrific or ghastly. It was way to rubbery and the effects too comedic to really warrant such phrases. None of the images served in this movie troubled me, which surprised me given the notoriety of this film. Or maybe I've just become too desensitised after watching too many Japanese gore/artsy productions? Definitely a movie that will put off many from so-called auteur or art-house flicks and definitely not recommended as a movie to start off a Lynch fan-club.

Thew squeaking of the puppies, the disturbance of the radiator, so on and so on.If I were to actually try and figure out what the film was about, my head would explode ala Scanners. I get some themes and meanings, but was lost in the so called narrative, if you can call it that. Lynch has always been one for the abnormal things and this is no different. I can say that this is one of his weirder ones and that is saying a lot.The dream sequence ties into the title and seem to have nothing to do with the film, upon first look that is. Eraserhead is definitely a 'watch more then once' experience. You can debate with everyone about what the film was trying to say or what the hell is was even about, but no one can be certain. I don't even think Lynch knows.Now whenever you watch a film that is experimental, you try to find some value and meaning within it. You want it to be more than just another weird film for the sake of being weird. Lynch has been accused of this many times, but I think he is better than that. His films do have substance, you can tell in how he tells the story and how things seem to re-appear. Unlike other films where they pop up and are never seen again. Even though there are numerous scenes that just simply don't make sense to me, like when the daughter is sitting on the couch and doing something weird, then the mother brushes her hair. Even worse is when the chicken starts bleeding and the mother reacts to it in a bizarre manner.This is my least favourite of Lynch's films, for the simple fact that I never was interested in what little story there was. It didn't seem to go anywhere and for me to be invested in a film it has to be telling a story, one that I can understand, comprehend, or at the very least, try to look more into. Eraserhead did none of this for me. After watching it, I do not really care to watch it again to find any hidden meanings or to try and understand whatever it is that I missed from the first viewing. I can go on in life saying that Eraserhead did nothing for me and of course be hated for it, but whatever.But never say never right? Who knows, maybe one day down the road I'll get a chance to watch this so called 'masterpiece' again, and think it's brilliant. Until then, I'll say not.

(I know someone somewhere is going to attack me for that, but it's true.) I found it to be pendulous and too long, but to its credit, it offered some interesting things to ponder. I didn't suppose the freaky wormbaby to be a premature birth, but rather, an abortion, and that its presence was symbolic of the trauma and sin of that action, which was being ignored and suppressed by Henry and Mary. It could also be just the illegitimacy of the child, which would render it socially freakish in a repressed society. Make sense? Based on that, I also thought that the image of the fluffy-faced woman in the radiator trampling on sperm-like little things was an indication of Henry himself being trodden down by the life he was forced into. But I think the point of Eraserhead is that it's able to be interpreted in different ways.but that doesn't mean i would watch it again voluntarily. nor does it mean that when it ended, i didn't start laughing and say, why the hell did i spend money to rent that?

Its genre is presented as combination of Fantasy / Drama / Horror and the keywords that have been used the most are disturbing, depressing, and bizarre. I found the movie hysterically funny and I laughed for the first 80 minutes of it (I saw the 88 minutes long version). The ending is surely disturbing and unpleasant but the movie has so many comical scenes and images that I wonder if someone else has got the same impression? How about Henry Spencer's (Jack Nance) electrified-looking hair that seems to point to Heaven, where everything is fine. You've got your good things. And I've got mine as sung by Lady in the Radiator (tell me she was not hilarious)? The dinner at X family with the carving of chicken scene in particular is a comical masterwork. How about a mutant baby? I think there is (or should be) a rule - the scariest monster is the one that we never see, the uncertainty is the scariest monster of all and as long as we don't see it we picture it in our imagination and get scared of what we imagine. Once the monster is for us to see, it is not scary anymore, it is laughable...After the movie was over and left me puzzled and uncertain to what I just saw, I decided to watch the interview with Lynch to see what the father of Eraserhead has to say about his movie, its idea, his interpretation. I've got to tell you that he did an awesome job in not telling anything about his own vision of what he created. The interview was longer than the movie and Lynch recalled the smallest details about the days (and months and years) of working on his first film while he was a student at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies when he was shooting mostly at night and used the most unusual buildings for his story or rather for collection of nightmarish images accompanied with the soundtrack that sounds like it was recorded in a machine shop. Yes, Lynch talked about many things but when it came to the question on what the movie is about he only said that for 25 years since the movie was released, he had never heard or read a single comment from the critics, viewers or reviewers that would come close to what his vision or concept was. Not a single one. The major impression I had that the movie was a meditation on the male-female relationship that culminates in parenting, and how far from ideal it could get. His first marriage ended while he was directing Eraserhead and there was a child from the marriage. My guess is that maybe Lynch did intend to bring his own bitterness, resentment, and disappointments to his first movie and during all those years he had been working on it, he turned it to the dark comedy.

I'd heard so many great things about it, how it was more or less a filmed nightmare, incredibly weird, and even, mindblowing. The high contrast b&w cameras, the strange and creepy imagery...all sound great in theory. But unfortunately, in reality, it's a film made by David Lynch.I can enjoy plots that develop slowly. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan. I even loved M. Night's Unbreakable, when most thought it was mind-numbing. But this is slow for the sake of being slow. Mr. Lynch isn't trying to build tension or eeriness, it seems slow because he didn't know what to film next and so just kept filming the same thing longer than he should have.I can--and usually do!--enjoy weird movies that don't make much sense (Or at least end with a violent upsurge of orthogonality) Pi, Itchi the Killer, Tetsuo, even 2001 A Space Oddyssey -- all films I loved. But Eraserhead tries too hard. It nearly doubles over backwards to give you weird, imagery, but Lynch never stops to wonder just how interesting the image is. In every scene I can hear him mumbling to himself in the editing room, Look at that! Isn't that cool! Ooooooooh!, and meanwhile I'm watching the screen, thinking Nope. Not really. In sum, this film is a young David Lynch trying as hard as he possibly can to do something strange, and succeeding I suppose, at the cost of a good movie. It's probably worth watching just so you can be conversant on it, since it seems to be such a staple of the weird-film-subculture, but, quite frankly, if this was my nightmare, I'd wake up bored.

It was a piecemeal project that took nearly five years to complete. After directing several shorts, Mister Lynch took on the task of creating a film. This surrealistic vision of a nightmarish future confused and shock many people (even to this day). Using black and white film stock and a jarring soundtrack, David Lynch has made a film that stands on it's own even to this day. Sadly, this movie is not widely released on D.V.D. and for a time it was only available through the director's own web site. It's very pricey but if you're a true fan of the movie the price isn't too bad.A strange young man finds himself in a loveless marriage to an even more eccentric woman. He meets her weird family and is surrounded by industrial complexes and strange noise that seem to come from everywhere. Everyday, the dude escapes from his dreary reality and finds solace in a little lady that lives in a radiator. But the day when the stork makes a visit and leaves a present for the couple is when everything sours to a point of no return. What happens next is impossible too describe and not worth spoiling. If you're a true fan of David Lynch then you'll want to watch this movie!!This has to be one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen. A true piece of work that's bizarre and eye candy for those who appreciate open interpretation films. Too bad David Lynch never made another film like this one ever again.

If you have ever seen this disaster then you must understand on some level why I would say that. Viewing this film is one of the most haunting, disgusting, and painful experiences I have ever faced, yet I see people giving it glowing reviews and decent scores. Perhaps that is more frightening than the movie itself.If you haven't seen it yourself, feel lucky and blessed. It is a bizarre exploration of the most torturous images and sounds ever. With each unsettling and grotesque scene combined with aggravating machinery sounds or the mutant baby gurgling and crying, or both, the movie does everything in its power to revolt the audience. Some people seem to thing that this movie is like Lynch's experiment, and his main goal was to horrify the audience. If that's the case then he was blindingly successful, but that in no way makes it a good film or him a good director. It makes him a sick director, and this a bad...oh god...a bad, utterly bad film. Lynch obviously didn't realize that movies are a form of entertainment, not physical and mental torture. This film and its relationship with the world is much like this Imagine you're given a painting by a famous painter, and that painting is hailed as a genius work of artistic experimentation. Now imagine the painting is a series of the most terrible images ever, and part of the creative genius of the painter was to splatter feces on it. Now ask yourself this, would hang this hailed masterpiece in your home...would you even want to be near it? Of course not. Despite the title of great art given to it, you know it's still horrifying images covered in reeking waste. That is the best way I can describe Eraserhead.Lynch fans will tell you that the movie is pure symbolism or key imagery, but that doesn't matter since every so-called symbol is horrendous to see or hear. I have seen more than my fair share of movies, some of which I would call utterly terrible. But even the worst movies can be so bad they are funny. This movie shatters those boundaries and steps fully into hellishly bad. There is nothing even remotely entertaining or forcedly funny about it. It is simply an exercise in soul crushing pain, that left me depressed and nauseated. Not just because it was the worst thing ever, but because it single-handedly proves that there is no God. For why would a god allow Lynch to live after creating this disease, let alone allow it to be formed in the first place.For those of you who may think I am overreacting, I say this...don't see it, for you cannot unsee it. If you plan to watch it for your own reasons, you will regret it. My advice is if anyone ever approaches you and suggest watching Eraserhead (even if that person is your best friend or mother), punch them in the face as hard as you can and run away as fast as you can, for you can be certain that that person is delirious or most certainly has bodies buried in the dirt floor of a cellar. Avoid this like the cancer it is. You have been warned.

It isn't any wonder why Lynch's output has made him a cult figure and hero he simply doesn't pander to any known movie regulations (he's his best audience), and his very dry humor reaches us cautiously, creeping up like fingers from beyond the grave. Lynch directs nightmares, but not just anybody's nightmares. His horrific hallucinations seem to stem from childhood--a lone boy's mounting terror at being sucked down into the unknown--and yet he revels in the experience. He's a consummate filmmaker, and often a quiet masochist, but if a viewer isn't attuned to Lynch's rhythms--or his fascination with the perverse--the twisted imagery just starts to look silly and self-indulgent. Eraserhead concerns two unwed freaks and their mutant offspring, and it is filmed in startling black-and-white utilizing a fine central actor (John Jack Nance, whose perplexity and child-like confusion is the most sympathetic part of the picture). David Lynch is green here, and probably unconcerned with audience reaction, but his style (a series of sickly scenes of human deterioration) is certainly gripping. The film is really not much more than a project, a talented student showing off, and it isn't absorbing as a whole. But in vignette form, and surely in retrospect, Eraserhead holds a peculiar power unmatched by any picture from a major Hollywood studio. Its eerie ambiance isn't accidental--Lynch is quite calculating as a scenarist and as a director--although the end results could be less personal than anyone realizes. It could be the ultimate in-joke on celluloid. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"sorry but","Date":"3 July 2006","Score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I don't care if you like symbolic filmaking, I've ssen enough to know what's what.

However, anyone who is tempted to watch it simply in order to discover what all the fuss is about should be aware that this is a *particularly* disturbing (I would say distressing) film, located at the darkest end of the spectrum of surrealism, and, due to its many very unpleasant and potentially frightening images, themes and inferences, it is best placed in the horror genre, despite its lack of traditional blood and gore.No matter what opinions of this film (both for and against) may be found on this website or anywhere else, this is not a film to watch without first considering the point that, whatever else it may be, it is almost universally considered to be extremely (even excessively) disturbing, and should DEFINITELY be avoided by anyone who is in a psychologically vulnerable condition.It is also probably best avoided by anyone who may find it upsetting to see imagery of premature, damaged, injured, deformed, mutated, mentally and/or physically abnormal, or dying/dead babies, as the film refers throughout to a baby which can, according to the viewer's interpretation(s), be placed into any or all of these categories (plus more, no doubt). Even though the baby in the film is evidently a model (and a poorly made one), it is still realistic enough, and peculiar enough in both appearance and behaviour, to potentially cause distress to anyone with psychological concerns regarding babies or childbirth. It is not for nothing that the term The Eraserhead Baby has entered the language, at least in the UK amongst adults over about 35, and is always used to mean something which is weird and scary.In my opinion the usual certification of the film is not high enough; while it does not contain explicit sexual content, graphic violence, or any of the other conditions which would cause it to be rated as an adult movie (e.g. drug use), it DOES contain very disturbing imagery and, as the mother of three children, I would certainly not allow them to watch it until they were fully adult, i.e. 18 or older - and even then, I would warn them (and anyone else) to beware of its genuinely disturbing nature and advise them not to watch it at all, as in my opinion it has no merit of any normal cinematic kind and can serve at best to make the viewer wonder why it was made, but at worst to leave the viewer psychologically unsettled or even permanently damaged, depending upon the robustness or otherwise of their psyche. This really is NOT a watch it for a laugh film.Although some argue that this film should not be judged by normal movie standards (I'd say because it doesn't meet any of them, but that debate belongs elsewhere), the term film tends usually to mean something with a discernible plot/story, widely comprehensible (not necessarily pleasant) content, and some kind of meaningful or at least understandable conclusion, hopefully with a bit of entertainment thrown in. So if one is to judge this film according to normal cinematic standards such as intended meaning (if any), storyline(s), acting performances, quality of direction and/or production, entertainment value, and so on, it scores very low (in fact, I'd say zero) in all such typical categories. It can be argued that the absence of plot and the disjointed, inexplicable nature of the film's progression is of merit because it is not a film, but is in fact a piece of art, but there is no point in entering *that* debate here, either. I would simply like to say that, if the director was trying to make a statement, it is impossible to tell whether he has succeeded, since it is not possible from watching the film to tell what statement, if any at all, is being made; indeed, although many people have managed to find meaning in the film, no two of them agree as to what that meaning is, so if it is there, it is so completely obscured by the film's bizarre incoherence as to be impossible to deduce with any certainty.What is certain is that I have yet to find any person at all who has watched this film without finding it disturbing in some degree, with many considering it very disturbing and unpleasant indeed, and finding themselves stuck with mental images and concepts which they wish they hadn't acquired - in other words, most of the people I know who have watched this film genuinely wish they hadn't, as they gained nothing useful from it - not even entertainment, as, in spite of its many peculiarities and a lot of unpleasant imagery, it somehow manages also to be, overall, noticeably dull to the point of being boring.All in all - don't expect to be impressed, or even entertained, but do expect to be disturbed to some extent, unless you are exceptionally hardened against films which set out to achieve precisely that effect.

It was an evening that I wish I could have back.Very rarely do I stop watching a movie before it is done, but that's exactly what I did here. The thing was so ridiculous that I simply could not bear it.The film opens up with the main character of the movie, Henry. Henry is a very strange man, as he seems to walk around in a daze, and live in a very strange and rundown building. In fact, most of the people seem to be walking around in a daze. I guess that's what happens after nuclear disaster. which is what is supposed to have happened, according to a friend.After 30 minutes of film (or did it just seem like 30 minutes), Henry has done nothing nothing whatsoever except walk around in a daze and mutter to himself, all very strangely; finally going over to his girlfriend's house for dinner. His girlfriend and her family are all blank stares and three-word phrases as Henry is. When the dinner is served, the main course, which appears to be some kind of game hen or pheasant, starts moving around on the plate, making little noises and oozing a black fluid. Henry and crew give their game hens blank stares and seem vaguely sad. It was at this point that I shut the tape off. I contemplated opening my second story window and casting it out, saving my town from the stupidity that is that film, but thought better and returned it instead.I have never liked anything else David Lynch has directed. Most people are convinced that he is a genius, so perhaps I'm just not clever enough to get it, but I don't think so. I had the same kind of reaction when Twin Peaks was on television. I watched one episode because everyone said it was genius, but it did nothing but irritate me throughout, and surprise me that people could be such horrible actors.If you are bound and determined to rent Eraserhead, then please find a discount rental store, or use a free rental coupon or something. Perhaps you will see in it something that I did not, this genius that everyone else seems to see, but if you are like me, then it will be all you can do to restrain yourself from taking your VCR, Eraserhead and all, burying it in your backyard, and going off to live with the Amish.

I strongly believe that his attachment to the surreal is entirely an excuse for his style, not the cause. The viewer gets the feeling that his grandiose scenes were thought out first -- and at the barrage of critics and their ilk, Lynch, running to his local library, ran to the kind of weird Freudian fiction section, grabbed a Kafka, and went, well, I mean, must I say more?His characters definitely should have said less. The ticking of clocks, the the steaming sounds of the radiator, the puling of the child, prove far more effective than the few banal (and poorly mixed!) words from Henry's mouth. Lynch, while generally visually talented, clearly had no idea how to present the dialogue of the film as visually as he presented its connotation. Hence, superfluous dialogue to help even the slowest viewers. Perhaps to help himself remember that the film is well, kind of like this German guy, Kafka!Kafka isn't the predecessor; it's Welles, specifically The Trial. The Trial is Welles' personal reading of Kafka; Eraserhead is Lynch's personal viewing of The Trial. And there is much insight between the two; but little of it solely that of Eraserhead.Make sure the volume is up high.

For one, all of the actors have a very bizarre way of enunciating their words, where they talk slowly and with stilted pronunciation. Almost no context is given to the world this film occupies; only two characters have names, and even then, they are only first names. The soundtrack is nothing but whirring industrial sounds and shrieking sirens, which makes sense considering the factory surroundings the main character occupies. While the film is very abstract, it is definitely very interesting. This movie is something you will either love or hate; my review will not help you decide.

There are piles of dirt like the ones in Fire Walk With Me. When The Lady . In The Radiator sings she reminds of the performance of In Dreams in Blue Velvet.

I feel it to be a portrayal of the dreams of David Lynch shown into a film. No, my problem is that there isn't enough material in the script for a feature-length. If it was another one of Lynch's short films, it would have been just fine. I would likely give a twenty, thirty minute short film of this, I'd likely give it an eight. Also, the baby. Where to begin? I think it could have been more effective if we don't see it. I'm not saying because it scared me, but just, it could be anything. It could let us imagine what it looks like, which in turn, may have made it more frightening. Now, I can see how one could like it and good for you if you do, you're likely a good person if we could respect one another's opinions. If someone on IFDb could make an edit similar to what I'd wish for it, I'd likely enjoy it, as I said earlier, probably eight out of ten for that. But as a feature-length film, four out of a possible ten.ONE MONTH LATER After thirty days of letting it sink in, not even seeing it twice, mind you, but a month later, this opinion has changed. First time I saw it, I thought it in a way of enjoyment, rather than enjoyment and quality, which is a more healthy way to review a good amount of films. Then I saw something in the film after thinking about it retrospect, I've gained more appreciation for it. I thought about the beauty achieved with the film and how the black and white works to the film's advantage, making it more haunting, which makes it unforgettable, for better or worse. One thing I love is how this worked in with Lynch's second film, Elephant Man, with similar themes of physical disabilities. We don't care for the baby for his disturbing look and cruel attitude and then we sympathize for the similarly disabled John Merrick, making them similar in more was than the same writer and director as well as black and white. After digesting the film, I'm changing it to a strong seven out of ten. You may not enjoy it, but it is an important film to see.

Once again, a movie has gripped me with it's slimy, creepy hands and once again a movie has taken me on a pure cinematic journey, even though that journey was an hour and a half of pure insanity. Movies like these are special to me because they are pretty much open for interpretation. A plot or story might be hidden somewhere in the film, however Director David Lynch has crafted a movie where the meaning can really be up to you and what you make it out to be. This is what I think the movie is about. Henry, a man of very small and little words makes a trip his girlfriend Charlotte's house. It seems that aren't the peachiest of couples, and to make it worst, on this visit, his girlfriend and her disturbingly strange family inform Henry that he and Charlotte have conceived a child. But not just any child, a very premature baby. The rest of the straight story is of Henry and Charlotte trying to live with this forever crying baby and keep their sanity. The last perhaps 30 minutes of the movie is nothing but surreal and haunting images and scenes. If the viewer wasn't already turned by the already hypnagogic scenes with Charlotte's family, the final parts, which include a big cheeked songstress living in Henry's radiator, giant sperm like things, and Henry taking a pair of scissors to the baby. I really dig this movie, the odd, dark, eerie black and white cinematography; it fit well with the industrious setting shown. There's too much too say the look of this movie, the pipes that run through and around Charlotte's home, the stage where the Radiator Girl sings my new favorite tune In Heaven Everything is Fine, and Henry's small apartment which reminds me of an insane asylum prison cell. There isn't much in the acting area; there's very little dialog. The actor who played Charlotte's father was a stand out as was the mother, they both boosted the insanity a bit. This is a technically impressive film; it's almost forty years old and the practical effects used throughout were very compelling. The movie may come off as too odd and artsy to most; there isn't a traditional story telling movie here. At some points I would agree. Being that this movie is seen by many as a horror movie, I would've liked to see a tiny bit more of a horror story with the movie, but with my taste in strange cinema, this was visually horrifying enough for me that it really was quite scary.

Henry is a quiet man in a dystopian, industrialized world. He is thrust into a relationship and fatherhood he's not ready for and slowly finds himself succumbing to the pressure of it all.The Good This is the hardest type of film to review. It's one of interpretation, symbolism and hidden meanings. Ten different people can watch it and come away with ten different interpretations of the film, which is likely what Lynch was going for in the first place. For me personally, I am not going to take some artsy-fartsy approach to this movie and simply state if you can't understand the meaning, then it is too artistic for you. I hate that sort of thing. I get that this isn't a movie for everyone, but you have to be able to relate to the film one way or another or the concept is simply lost on the viewer. Lynch didn't lose me, but there were times when I was certainly confused. What I did love about the film was how well Lynch conveyed the plight of Henry without dialogue. The industrialization of the world Lynch portrays is a hissing, steaming, rumbling, disconcerting environment that grates on your nerves as you watch Henry toss and turn in the unsettling apartment. It reminded me a lot of the Japanese film Tetsuo The Iron Man. The imagery, such as the un-potted plants (basically, just mounds of dirt with plants in them) the radiator, the constant rain and whirring of machinery, the dream sequences... all these things captivate the viewer and regardless of whether it all makes sense, you understand Henry's fears and inner desires. As a husband and a father, I can understand the stresses of that role and for someone not prepared for it, this is a great visual and visceral way to watch that experience play out. Who wouldn't be haunted by finding out your girlfriend just gave birth to Admiral Ackbar? The Bad The movie simply gets too out there at times. I've only watched the movie once, true, but there were too many head-scratching moments and they begin to stack up by the end of the film. It ends up feeling cumbersome to watch. I feel like I could watch it ten more times and still not understand certain elements of the story. There is most certainly a core storyline to be followed that is somewhat clear and the viewer clings to that (even if it that storyline is itself somewhat ambiguous), but when we start getting to the Eraserhead sequences, most viewers are going to get left in the dust. Art-house folks will praise it for that value and give it a 10. Mainstream movie lovers will give it a 1 because, at times, it makes no sense in logical movie terms. Me, I found it fascinating, yet too metaphoric in parts, so I can give it nothing but a middle of the road grade.The Interpreted I find that films that require too much interpretation can be taxing on the viewer. I'm not saying everything has to be spelled out or wrapped up nice and neat with a big, red bow, but interpretation has it's limits for me. This one somewhat exceeded those limits. While certain aspects of the film (mostly the cinematography) were visually appealing, the feeling of what is going on? isn't an enjoyable one when watching a film, especially when the story isn't tied together all that well at the end. There were metaphorical props in this movie that, aside from not even knowing what they symbolized with respect to the story... hell, I didn't even know what I was looking at!

And it fulfilled this vision for me, 100 percent. ~ David LynchLife's absurdEraserhead shows a man called Henry Spencer, who's trying to preserve his naivety, maybe even his innocence. His path is never straight, albeit rather printing a zigzag shaped pattern almost as if it expresses life's randomness or its fragile and shaky basis; a ground-floor built from quantum mechanical components. Reality or nature reveals its duality in many a detail and situation, and Henry seems unable to tell dream or nightmare from the real. Henry's path through life crosses many nightmarish events, and his inner world reflects the exterior and vice versa, as if the textures between inside fluently blend into the outside, giving boundaries the uncertainty of twilight zones.Behind his naive looks his spiritual mind seeks a light in this gloomy day to day existence. He works as a printer in a pencil-factory, but he is having vacation at the moment. Fatherhood and marriage do not bring any release or distraction, albeit enhance the experience of a mental confinement. He wanders about the origin of his desires; who delivered them and why are they no good according society? Life and its rules permanently torture him like the cries of his baby in yet another sleepless night. Next to his bed a denuded plant in a mound of dirt and a picture on the wall of a mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb explosion decorate his room. The atomic bomb called Little Boy killed many a human being, yet ended the world war II. The denuded plant resembles the X family's grandma in such way that it expresses the uncertain barrier between life and death. Does the plant in its winter state expose Henry's Christian roots; a promise of an afterlife? From within the robustness of the rock St Peter pulls the strings in Henry's life in a way that it feels lacking warmth and a heart.Henry's mind does not leave him at peace as his desires grow and grow. Then in a dream he receives a vision. The Lady in the Radiator reveals him how to treat these rules and bonds. When she retreats Henry experiences a nightmare in which he is lying in bed next to his wife Mary, who is giving birth to four umbilical cords. Afraid of Mary's bonds Henry acts according his vision and smashes the life-cords against the wall. Soon he awakes and he finds himself alone with his baby. In the very beginning, when Henry was on his way home carrying his groceries, his mind drifted off in spiritual realms about cause and effect, about the origin of life, his life, the baby's life, life in general? The man in the rock, the puppeteer with the ripped open chest, seemed to control everything, but Henry remained uncertain about the man's residence. Maybe he existed within his own grey matter only? The hole in the roof suggested that his place inside the house was taken by force ... a result of education and social control.Dream or real, Henry fully engages in an affair with his beautiful neighbor. Henry silences his baby and he and the dark haired lady completely dissolve in a pool of love. Within this exaltation Henry makes first contact with his Lady in the Radiator. For a moment he truly is in heaven, but as the beautiful dark lady and the all white girl retreat, Henry faces the heartless puppeteer, whose rage blows away the stage and who confronts Henry with the tree of knowledge. Henry becomes very aware of his sins and he accepts that this can not remain unpunished. He loses his head completely or is it decapitated by the puppeteer (mind the name of the actress playing Henry's lover - http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Beheading_Holofernes). His animalistic behavior might as well been orchestrated from his stem or from a small baby-head as he seems unable to resist innate desires. The pool of blood on heaven's floor can no longer bear Henry's head. His head tumbles down from the skies and bursts open in the middle of the road. Its contents provides excellent stuff for erasers. What started as a sweet dream ended into yet another nightmare's existence. All those restrictions and rules suffocated Henry's life to such extremes that he could no longer restrain from a long desired urge. Henry's life felt like a sick joke. In a state between curiosity and madness Henry decides to get rid of these imperative restrictions, to endure and to face his fears to finally reaching his most desired heavenly freedom and blissful understanding in the realms of the creature of light with her mushroom shaped face.

Sure there are others but lynch productions are his own and not copied from others, at least I haven't noticed as of yet who or what he has copied. If wanting to expand your mind and experience difference this a nice starting point, along with his short films, have you not discovered them yet. For those who have, you know what i'm talking about. This film can also be used to put a chill up someone's spine. Might I recommend viewing with the lights out at night, at a decent volume, preferably in surround sound. This is labeled a 'horror' not because it's a slasher/torture/rape/exploitation flick but because its like anything you've ever seen. This is one that definitely lives up to its hype and nothing has come close since. Enjoy!

It's far too vague and far too ambiguous. The surrealism is no holds barred and from the opening sequence itself the entire web starts to cast itself. It's hard to describe one's feeling towards a movies like this. Discomforting, well if that's the exact effect then sure it's a commendable piece of art but gratuitously overloaded with squalor so as to accomplishes the same, then doubts tend to rise. Something like Clockwork orange, it was so discomforting and still so intricately designed that even that discomfort had a meaning. Having said that in no way I would refer to Eraserhead as an overblown piece of art.For one Eraserhead did provide me with a new definition for movies, something transcending a narrative structure, a plot/ a story line or other conventional film making tools. It underscores the pure imaginative power of movies. The entire universe with no boundaries and no restrictions and this liberation I have indeed sought on more than a few occasions. Shredding the delusion of staging events in reality and escaping completely into the realm of imagination. For the longest time I tried to dissect the movie, I again and again tried to decipher meaning out of the details I could find here and there but sometime in between I lost track of that and simply immersed into the world of David Lynch. This world didn't make sense but it did give an emotional stimulus that we call art (again maybe, I don't quite know). Of all the assumptions and arguments put forth one that truly makes it easier for me to understand Eraserhead is that of it's Dream like nature. For dreams are neither edited nor structured or expository, they simply are images that arise from the subconscious and sneak into the cauldron of mind and when you wake up and irrespective of whether you remember or not, your heart doesn't stop thumping.

It's a David Lynch film so I was prepared for weirdness but that is all that seems to be going for this film. It's just so darn slow while mainly just focusing on the imagery most of the time. A lot of times, I just can't get into art-house types of movies and this is one I just couldn't get into. The plot is just flat and hardly anything to it, but it's still about a hour and a half long since it moves along so slowly. Despite the weird and surreal imagery and characters I was bored with this one. With the constant eerie space noises in the background. Which is in some art-house films, maybe to bring out the feeling of chaos. The protagonist Henry seems like a nice guy who is just out of it and confused most of the way through. And he actually adds to the surrounding and made me understand what might be going on a bit more. I don't know maybe I just missed out on a lot of the symbolism or something. Or maybe some people that praise this film are just self-indulgent and pretentious to the point of liking this film(or acting like they like it). Maybe it is a brilliant film, but personally I just didn't enjoy it much. It felt way too slow for my taste and I started to run out of patience. It does seem to pick up after the first hour though.

Many a times whenever we go through a nightmare we feel that we are out of our mind we have something in our mind called sub-conscious that view or think things weirdly, that is the same sub-conscious is what David Lynch should thank himself, because at the time he made this movie his sub-conscious mind was at peak I think, so that he could create something which could not be re-created anymore not even by himself. Similar to some people I also feel that this movie is surely a cult in itself. Many gifted directors like David Lynch really use their sub-conscious mind a lot because creating a non repeatable movies like this which requires equally that much enormous amount of creativity.We keep saying that life is a mixed bag which prominently holds mostly happiness and sorrow, yes Lynch here outlines all those in a his own dimension. He uses symbols as his main tool for encryption of his facts he wanted to portray here, these facts aren't analyzable in a uniform way because these facts may vary for person to person depending on their mindset and that's just what the David Lynch wanted!This movie not everybody's cup of tea.

After having sexual intercourse with the sultry neighbor woman he gets into a mood where he feels especially inadequate and lacking in control so when he is losing his head it is replaced by the baby's, he feels as helpless as a baby and it maybe also indicates that he sees the baby as threatening to eventually take his place. As for his real head, it drops on the floor and becomes a commodity. His brain becomes pieces of rubber on the end of pencils, again even in this state the only thing he's good for is being a tool that is of a destructive nature. The kid who brings his head to the eraser factory receives money, even dead he's worth more than right now while he's alive.The plant in his apartment is a pathetic-looking branch sticking out of a big pile of earth on his nightstand and some little maggot thingy that he receives per mail he just puts into a cabinet in hope for something to grow out of it, instead it doesn't even move anymore the next time he opens the cupboard. In bed his girlfriend ejects big sperm-like thingies in her sleep and he can't help but throw them out of bed and against the wall in disgust. When towards the end the man tries to overcome his inadequacy to create by at least wanting to understand how things work he cuts up the baby's bandage just to have the baby itself cut open with his only option left being to put the baby out of its misery and killing it, and not even this he can do well.Henry occasionally drifts into a more blissful fantasy state which in his little apartment is usually triggered by the humming of the radiator. But rather than just harmless escapism I think this is more indicative of his flowering death drive. Behind the radiator he at first just imagines an empty stage. Then there's a woman on the stage who crushes those sperm-like thingies which have heads that very much resemble the baby's. Later the same woman sings about everything being fine in Heaven (in Lynch's own angelic high-pitched voice) and after killing his child the film ends with Henry and the woman embracing each other while light embraces them and the screen fates to white.

Frankly, I'm not even sure if I can rate this movie as 'good' or 'bad', simply because I have never seen anything even remotely like Eraserhead. But good vs. bad isn't really the point. It's how the movie made me feel.This isn't a warm, lighthearted family film. It isn't comical. I've seen it under the genre of Horror and Suspense, but that doesn't quite seem to fit. I wasn't horrified, I was perturbed. I wasn't in suspense, I was in shock. Eraserhead is quite uncomfortable to watch; not necessarily because of the disturbing props or character's strange behavior, but because it made me question everything that was going on in the film.Is Eraserhead about sanity vs. insanity? Marriage and love? Bearing children? Sin and lust? The dream world and the waking world? Loneliness? Questioning the world and your place in it? Questioning your consciousness and yourself? Heaven and Hell? Life and death? I tried to pick one of the symbolic themes I've named above (or ones I didn't feel or notice) and I've found it impossible. It seems to be about everything I mentioned; and depending on who is watching Eraserhead, it could be about none of the things I mentioned. That's what is so fascinating about this movie.Eraserhead is almost inexplicable to someone who hasn't seen it, but I feel it's worth a look. I will say it's not for everyone as it may keep you up at night.For those willing to take a peek at this mysterious film Whether you find Eraserhead to be interesting or boring; symbolic or a silly mess; a bunch of nonsense or a work of genius, it is unforgettable and haunting.

There is no doubt that this film is very strong on audio - in fact the soundtrack really gets under your skin and creates such an ambiance right from the outset that you almost feel yourself being reeled in. The main character - Henry - is surely a modern day version of Buster Keaton. You really do feel that there is a nod to the silent films era, not only with the visuals but with the humour, most of which is unerringly black. There are many set pieces in the film which serve to both unnerve and amuse you in equal measure, which in itself makes for quite an unsettling experience. The supporting cast are nothing short of excellent. There are several other reviews out there which label this film as groundbreaking and I would say that that label is certainly justified. It will be obvious to those viewing this that certain directors of certain movies now regarded as classics will have had the seeds of an idea from this movie. For those die-hard Lynch fans out there, you will LOVE this film. For those who have never entered the bizarre world of the director, you will certainly take something from this.

So why did I do it then? I thought 8 was a reasonable number, because it is high enough to garner attention (which this film definitely deserves), but low enough to suggest that it is not one of the greatest film achievements of our time. With that in mind, I'll begin my exercise in futility. Excluding all of the surreal events and scenes (which may or may not contain symbolic significance), the plot is fairly straightforward. Henry Spencer works at a printing press, and is on vacation. He is invited to his girlfriend's (Mary's) house to have dinner with her and her family (The Xs). Upon visiting, he's informed that Mary had given birth prematurely, and that he had an obligation to marry her. From that point forward, the film delves deeper and deeper into Henry's psyche, as he is bombarded with the consequences of his situation, psycho- sexual imagery, thoughts of suicide, and hellish fantasies. Those who have seen Eraserhead will testify that it is undoubtedly the most bizarre film ever created--they could very well be correct in saying so. It would be unjust for me to elaborate, because excessively describing any of the surreal scenes in the film would cheat any would-be viewers out of the surprises the film has to offer. David Lynch has referred to this film as a dream of dark and troubling things, and the film is closer to that description than any other film before it. It is as if Lynch has analyzed every aspect of a nightmare and created a film from them. The black and white color scheme was a good choice, seeing that some dreams take on a colorless form. Other aspects of the cinematography contribute to the enigmatic, sinister vibe of a nightmarish vision. The beginning shot that sets this disturbing, abstract nightmare in motion is an extremely unsettling image; one that has stuck with me since the first viewing. When making a movie, it is important to establish a connection between the audience and the main character. Lynch has accomplished this with little to no character development whatsoever. There is no deep back-story provided for Henry. He never gives a gut-wrenching, insightful, Oscar-worthy monologue to win the audience over. Lynch instead uses the barren, bleak, and uninspired landscapes as his medium for characterization. The strange sense of isolation Lynch creates as Henry stumbles through his nightmare is an indirect way of personality-building. Henry is alone, helpless, and doomed, and the audience is right there with him every step of the way. The screenplay is staggered; sparse. Nightmares may contain this awkward pause-filled dialogue, but seeing these conversations play out in a movie comes across as a disturbing mess, because much of what little dialogue there is in this movie simply makes no sense at all. Makes no sense at all; this impulsive statement is unfortunately a good description for the bulk of the movie. The film has prompted many responses from audiences, including hand-to-mouth surprised expressions, as well as knee-slapping laughter (to name a few). When critiquing art, the comment that a piece makes no sense is an irrelevant and juvenile judgment. Art doesn't have to make sense--by that rationale, films don't have to make sense either. Reviewing this film is like critiquing the abstract pieces of Jackson Pollock, or Salvador Dali-- ultimately, there is nothing bad or good about this movie. What is certain, though, is that Lynch has created one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. 4/5 "},{"Title":"Classic Lynch in his Eraserhead Form","Date":"28 March 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Stephen King is to Novels as David Lynch is to Films. You're going to enter the minds of some very twisted individuals with King and Lynch. When you watch a film that a director wrote and produced, you're usually entering their mind, it's almost like a portal into their world. Well Welcome to Eraserhead!! The genius with Lynch is, he's so brilliant that once in awhile he accidentally makes a completely abstract, surrealistic mess into something amazing, with those movies being, in my opinion, Wild at Heart, and Mulholland Drive. WaH and MD barely come together as being some sort of story and that they come together with a beginning and an end(Not a conventional beginning and end though, this is Lynch we're talking about here)in a Lynch film is amazing within itself. WaH and MD are brilliant movies! Blue Velvet, a little overrated in my opinion, but still very good. Then Great movies that are of the 'norm' that Lynch Directed and wrote(one of them) is The Elephant Man and The Straight Story. Two movies that kind of get Lynch out of himself for a moment, and prove his true genius as a filmmaker-not just his usual abstract stuff, but his true genius in what he knows in general as a filmmaker. I really wish Lynch would have shown more of his talent as he did with The Elephant Man and The Straight Story because he really is a great director, and if he would have gotten out of himself a little more and was more diverse in his career, I think he would have easily been one of the Top Ten Best Director's of all time. But be that as it may you get his usual stuff, the abstract stuff, which is Eraserhead and his other films which consists of about 75 percent of his career. To understand Eraserhead is like trying to understand Life. Nowadays, a director with this kind of film as Eraserhead, would be called an Abstract Artist where his or her Abstract Film would be shown in the Gallery of a Small Art Museum. Because really, it comes down to this old question, is Porn exploitation or art? Everyone will have an opinion on that one, most probably won't agree with the latter on that one. So the same question applies with Eraserhead. Is Eraserhead a film or just art or both? Art is subjective, film is subjective, Film can be Art, Art can be film, but I believe one can be objective very minimally with the two(Film and Art) and splitting the two like splitting an atom. Technically Eraserhead is a film, but really it's not a film, it's a piece of David Lynch, it's pure abstract art. I honestly liked Eraserhead, and in my opinion, as all of you may be asking the number one question, 'What the (Blank) was this 'film' about?'...Nothing! That's my opinion, Lynch likes to express himself through his films, he likes to push his limits and he doesn't ever care if anything makes sense or not,(the ending is hilarious and Eraserhead is pretty funny here and there, I would almost believe that Lynch would get a kick out of watching people laugh when they watch his zany, abstract films because I could imagine Lynch would get off on the fact that you're laughing because it makes no sense and Lynch is laughing because he watches you react to his work in that manner), so like i said, when one of his abstract films comes together into making any kind of sense at all like Mulholland Drive and Wild at Heart did, it's a real miracle, and probably very accidental on Lynch's part. You cannot deny Lynch's brilliance though, he's truly an amazing artist, and i just wish he would have shown more of his amazing gift as a director. With Eraserhead though, don't put too much thought into trying to figure it out, you won't, it's subjective remember ;) "},{"Title":"Eraserhead","Date":"21 March 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Eraserhead follows Henry Spencer, a soft-spoken fellow with an extremely amusing haircut, as he deals with living in a small, isolated apartment and taking care of his newly-born, premature, mutant baby. It sounds ridiculous on paper, but strangely, makes less sense after viewing it. I have seen it twice in the last two months, and it has become one of my favorites.The acting in Eraserhead ranges from solid to outstanding. Jack Nance's performance as Henry Spencer is superb (at least in my opinion). The majority of his screen time does not consist of dialogue, and he conveys Henry's emotions well, particularly those of discomfort and uneasiness. Charlotte Stewart does a passable job as Mary, the mother of Henry's mutant child. Most of the movie consists of scenes involving these two characters. The other actors and actresses perform their roles as needed, and the film does not suffer from any bad acting.Eraserhead's cinematography is mostly standard, and serves the story well. The film utilizes some creative shots, and from what I remember, held my attention for the duration of the movie. Eraserhead's visual effects are about what you'd expect from a low-budget film. They are done well enough not to induce any cringing or vomiting, except of course where they are intended to. The sound effects, on the other hand, are the strongest aspect of Eraserhead's technical performance. Because dialogue is not featured prominently, what the viewer hears becomes a major part of their experience. In one scene, I was more concerned with a bubbling sound in the background then with what was happening on-screen, so much so that I had to rewind to see if I'd missed anything important. Not that the sound effects are distracting, but they are so captivating and pleasing. Even the sound of the baby's constant crying was mesmerizing.While all of these components affect the viewer's perception of the film's quality, it is ultimately its storyline that will either make them a fan or severely disappoint them. Director David Lynch is known for leaving interpretation of the film's strange imagery and shocking conclusion up to the viewer, and for keeping its intended meaning to himself. Those who do not enjoy applying symbolism or greater meaning to media, or are just too lazy to try, will likely walk away from this movie with disgust. Personally, I took pleasure in thinking critically about the film's message and applying my own meaning to it. My interpretation after my second viewing is entirely different from what I originally thought, and I'm willing to guess it will change after viewing it again, which I most definitely plan on doing.Eraserhead is not a film for every viewer, especially those accustomed to movies made purely for thoughtless enjoyment. To me though, it is a highly respectable achievement in filmmaking.

He is a truly unfiltered artist who puts all his fascinations, fears and inspirations down on film - for better or for worse. Eraserhead is Lynch's first film - essentially, this is little more than a bizarre feature-length student film. It's low-budget and experimental, with untrained actors and not much plot or character development to speak of. Yet Eraserhead is crafted with such care, and has such confidence and consistency in the strange, dark world it builds up, that it clearly stands out from just about every other amateur art-film ever made. This movie boldly and unforgettably marked the arrival of a genuine new talent. David Lynch is one of those rare directors who are already capable of filmmaking genius on their first try. Eraserhead is filled to the brim with strange, evocative imagery I doubt I will ever forget the sight of the mutant baby, or the ominously cheerful puffy-cheeked lady, or sad-sack protagonist Henry as he shuffles through an unnamed industrial city. Eraserhead also is the rare movie capable of earning different reactions on each viewing - I initially found it weirdly hilarious, but on repeat watches it is sometimes frightening and discomforting. And while movies can't get much more abstract or bizarre than Eraserhead without spinning off into utter incoherence or perversity, there are some grounded, real fears to be found here. Much of the movie's imagery and scant story revolve around the terror that everyone experiences at some point when entering the responsibility of adulthood and parenthood. For some new parents, Eraserhead could function as an offbeat therapy session.By design, this movie is not for everyone. Be aware of that before watching. But it is one of the best directorial debuts of all time - not to mention one of the flat-out strangest films I've ever seen, without coming across like it's 'trying too hard'.

Everything is twisted, but with its own logic, one that remains fundamentally out of human understanding -- or at least the understanding of humans that aren't David Lynch.And then we have Jack Nance, the titular eraser-headed man, trying to survive in this world -- although, in the end, he's every bit as warped and vile as the rest of it. Still, there's a kind of everyman sympathy that Nance brings to the role, that films the basic human connection that makes this movie so great. My favourite films are the ones that combine an unique aesthetic vision with a tangible human component, and Eraserhead easily fits into all these categories.I've liked the rest of Lynch's films that I've seen, but all of them have felt a little distant and gesturing at something that they don't fully express. Eraserhead, on the other hand, is a complete statement in one haunting package. Maybe that completeness is something Lynch wanted to abandon, but in any case, it makes this film great.

Lynch is behind such fascinations as Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, and, of course, Twin Peaks. My ultimate justification is that David Lynch and I share a birthday which probably explains a lot.Nonetheless, I most certainly recommend.

I think the previous sentence summarises the visual, narrative and overall style and direction of the films. Don't get me wrong, there is a clear direction, but that direction is very, very strange.Surreal.Watch Eraserhead, ideally with someone else, otherwise it would be weird.

The inspiration of director, the cast, the sound or the lights, the sound or the script are relevant but never enough. Or the importance of this film consist in a special art to discover the essence of a world with respect and precision. And Jack Nance, a great actor, with a powerful art, knows to discover the force of a victim and the vulnerability of an infant, the sign of lie and politics in a life who exist only like part of his country's destiny. A rare case in which the nationality of director is relevant. Why? Because this movie reflect the history of America in his precious beauty, in his real fear.

Oooo, I'm so nervous with excitement! I have seen about every Lynch movie, totally love all of them, but didn't like Eraserhead at first, but now I've seen it four times. Huh? Why? What? The thing I can tell you the most about Eraserhead is that I don't know exactly what it's about, frankly, but I like some peoples take on it, but others, well...... Let's look at it this way- The reason I and I think people are drawn to this movie is the FEEL one gets from it, the FEEL, okay? not the 'ooo let's figure it out because there is the secret to life hidden somewhere' thing. Interperations of art are usually WAY too convoluted. People read WAY TOO MUCH into things, OMG! I doubt the 13 seconds before the elevator moves has anything to do with anything. Lynch likes to put things like that in to mess with viewers. People think there is some special THING to figure out. NO! Here is what Lynch does in every movie that draws us into it- I like the sounds of the train, the confused and scared look on Henry's face and so many other characters he has created, the totally bleak as hell look of his apartment that makes you want to kill yourself, the long pauses in between dialog that Lynch would later do in all his movies that gives you an uneasy feeling. Flickering lights, beautifully creepy music with beautiful women, all mixed in with an almost Three Stooges comedy that clashes with the seriousness of it all, which is brilliant. My point is, it's really a painting, but moving picture, so really a moving painting. It's the feel you get, not a twist ending or convoluted mystery story like so many films try to do, and then you only want to watch the movie once, NEVER AGAIN. Lynch has quoted this film as ' look at it as a painting, (watch it all the way through without stopping it, take it all in.') Yes, he said it most certainly is about his being in Philadelphia and what a crappy place it was, and he had a daughter there and it has to do with the stress of that. Yet people read too much into movies and songs, dissecting every little piece of thing that you lose sense of what the artist was trying to do in the first place. And trust me, I don't make this point because I'm 'dumb' or lazy and can't see those secret things. Notice how the warehouse door says 27 on it when they show Henery outside opening the tiny box he got in the mail? Thats the number of the hooker living across from him. Yes, she's a hooker,you know that, right? which adds to Henery's naivet√©' that he could have her, did you figure that one out? But does it really mean anything, those numbers matching, I don't think so, it's Lynch being a smartie with us. lol Me personally?, I think the lady in the radiator in an angel from heaven, and that at the end, he puts his deformed baby out of misery by killing it, but still is able and it's OK to go to heaven. Could also be some take on abortion. Murder is a forgivable sin in the bible. Remember, Lynch said that he didn't know the thing that would pull the whole movie together, until he read a line in the bible, and booya! he had it. And he is well know for saying he may never ever reveal what that line is he read in the bible.

In an interview led by French newspaper Liberation in 1987, the filmmaker was asked why he was making cinema and he answered to create a world and to experiment it. This is what he perfectly does throughout this oppressive nightmare.Eraserhead can be read at different levels. At the first degree, the filmmaker develops a simple story that is constantly distorted by the bizarre and the horror. An artistic choice reinforced by an audacious making with disturbing shots. Set in an industrial town, the main protagonist Henry (Jack Nance) has a girlfriend Mary (the actress was the teacher miss Beadle in Little House TV series). He's invited to dinner by the young girl's parents. This sequence flops. Then, Mary raises a monstrous fetus that's constantly crying and treats him like a normal baby. Shattered by its incessant cries, she's leaving Henry's room, leaving him alone with the monster. The latter doesn't seem to want to take care of it and wants to eliminate it.Throughout his work, Lynch shows Henry trying to escape from this oppressive world. Numerous shots depict enlarged details belonging to objects or parts of the room and they are shot in a weird manner. Furthermore, two ladies are in his mind his female neighbor with whom he seems to be in love and the lady in the radiator who sings corny songs. But the monstrous fetus always reappears...I'm not a David Lynch aficionado but throughout the years I warmed to his first visual nightmare and it remains a testing experience. A must-see film.

I was not around when this film came out, and I never even heard of it until sometime within the past few weeks when I saw a clip from it, the part showing the character known as the Lady in the Radiator singing the haunting and repetitive song, In Heaven! This made me curious enough to watch the movie, and it didn't take long at all before I did just that. I got plenty of warning about how incredibly weird and sometimes gruesome it was before watching it, and as popular as I knew it was, it wouldn't have been surprising if I got basically nothing out of it, but that's not what happened.In a decaying, post-apocalyptic society, Henry Spencer is a printer who lives in an industrial town full of noisy machines, and is currently on vacation. His estranged girlfriend, Mary X, invites him over to her family's house for dinner one night, so he comes over. After a very strange session at the dinner table, Mary's mother takes Henry into another room and informs him that Mary has just given birth to a baby very prematurely, and he happens to be this baby's father! Because of this, he is now obliged to marry his estranged girlfriend, so Mary and the baby, a severely mutated child, move into Henry's apartment with him. When the couple attempt to sleep, the mutant baby just won't keep quiet, so Mary decides that she can't take it anymore and temporarily moves back in with her family, leaving the disfigured child with Henry, who is now headed for one bizarre and frightening mixture of instances!As I watched the beginning here, I could already tell that it certainly wasn't going to be one of the most understandable films I've ever seen, showing bizarre scenes in a slow-paced manner. It looked like I was going to find most of Eraserhead boring at first, and I wasn't finding the acting in the sporadic moments of dialogue to be all that impressive, but I wasn't going to give up yet. I kept watching to see what would happen, and I think I started finding the film more intriguing when Henry comes over to the X family's home, though I didn't find absolutely everything before that to be boring. From this point on, I found lots of tension in this very weird story which is a lot like a crazy dream with its incoherence, but that's not necessarily a bad thing! Some parts didn't grab me as much as others did, but the all the insanity was definitely enough to hold my attention basically all the way up until the very sudden ending! I think the gloomy atmosphere and constant sounds of machinery and howling wind really helped.Many consider this 1977 feature-length debut from David Lynch to be a masterpiece, while there are also lots of people who have been absolutely disgusted by it, and I can understand that perfectly. It's truly a mind-boggling motion picture, and it sure can get disturbing, especially during the scenes with the mutant baby! Also, what exactly the movie is about is probably largely up to the viewer to decide. You can be VERY sure that Eraserhead is not for kids, and many adults wouldn't be able sit through it, either, which I certainly can't fault them for. If you're used to mainstream cinema, you'd better prepare yourself for something very different if you're going to watch this polarizing cult film, and also be ready for the constant weirdness and unusual gruesomeness that you're bound to see. You've been warned! It's definitely not a film I would want to watch multiple times, but you just might find that you don't even want to watch it once, or maybe you'll be even more impressed than I was!

Eraserhead has been one of those films. However, after reading about how disturbing the movie is, and how many movies magazines and critics have labeled it among the most bizarre and even dangerous films ever made, I have always been very reluctant to see it.I have seen other weird films that I have been intensely curious about, but after seeing them, I could not sleep afterwords. Having refused to see Eraserhead unless it was with other people, not by myself, I finally saw the movie the way it was meant to be seen at a special midnight showing in the Coolidge Corner Theater, located in Brookline, Massachusetts.After seeing it, I fortunately don't have nightmares, but I still can't stop thinking about the film. It is almost always bizarre, sometimes grotesque, and a bit startling at times. What's amazing is how it doesn't feel dated, despite being 35 years old. It's shot in a cool black and white, which gives it a noir feel that has never run out of date. There are also very few (almost no) 20th century technological devices in it, making the film as relevant to 2011 as it was to 1976. It's also amazing that newer generations of moviegoers (like myself) are still drawn to it despite how weird it is.And yes, make no mistake about it, Eraserhead is very, very, very weird, and oftentimes incredibly intense. However, film lovers still see method in director David Lynch's madness, even though they may not completely understand it.Another part of this film's appeal is how the incoherent story structure is used towards this movie's advantage. Without one of the 14 standard Hollywood plots, the film takes hold of your desire to see what happens next. Every drawn out moment of silence clutches onto your attention span, and every eccentric character shocks you, but dares you to look away.It goes without saying that the question everyone has probably asked themselves at least once while seeing this film is, Why? Why does the lead character wear his hair straight up like he's been electrocuted? Why did he and his girlfriend try to raise a deformed baby in a cramped apartment? Why does this man see a singing woman in his radiator? Why does this woman have such huge, deformed cheeks? Why does she sing In Heaven, Everything Is Fine?People who hate this film (and I imagine there are more than a few) have asked themselves variations of this basic question, but refuse to answer them. Fans of the film probably have different answers to this question every time they attempt to answer it. David Lynch's answer is probably, Why not?, which definitely keeps film fans coming back.

There are many reasons why this movie has been so popular and it certainly merits its status even if it's surprising that so many people like this disturbing, slow paced and anti-mainstream flick.The movie has been shot in black and white and works a lot with surreal images, absurd scenes and strange sounds. The first ten minutes are without any dialogues and even when some characters begin to talk, there conversations are reduced to a straight minimum. The story is slow paced but yet very difficult to explain. The story is set in a very dark, grey and desperate industrial region which creates a truly haunting atmosphere. A weirdo, brilliantly played by the amazing and very authentic Jack Nance, gets the message that his ex-girlfriend is pregnant and they get together again to live with the baby that nobody wanted to get born. The couple soon feels imprisoned by the presence of an ugly and totally weird baby and is longing for freedom and afraid of taking responsibilities. That's the part of the story that is easy to explain but concerning the ending and the whole meaning of the movie, everyone should make up his own mind just as I have developed my proper theory.The movie is highly experimental and a weird piece of avant-garde. It is difficult to approach because of the lack of dialogues and the very slow paced development. The movie is sometimes gore and disgusting, sometimes transcending and surreal and deals a lot with the topic of sex in a very artistic and mature way.Personally, I would suggest to anyone that likes original and experimental movies to have a look on this flick as it influenced many famous directors, actors and even musicians and shows us the roots of a brilliant director that later created masterpieces such as Twin Peaks or Lost highway. This is one of those movies that this kind of people should have seen at least once in their lives. It will surely be a very special and unforgettable experience but you will adore or hate it for sure as there is not much left in between. I really adore it but I didn't give the highest ratings because David Lynch has even done better movies and because there is even stuff out there that is weirder than this one, but Eraserhead is surely a brilliant introduction to the surreal art of cinema.

Filmed over a three year period (Lynch was a film student at the time and kept running out of resources but stayed persistent in seeing it completed), it tells the story of...well...um...that's a good question. There is a relationship, and a mutant baby and man-made chickens and a man in a dark planet and bum knees and a woman in a radiator who sings and a machine that makes erasers out of people's heads (but that might have been just a dream...inside of a dream...or something like that)... well, I think you get the idea. Eraserhead (like many of Lynch's later films) has its own dream logic that, for some inexplicable reason, works (that is, *if* you allow yourself to be absorbed into its world and throw reason aside for its 89 minute running time) and you find yourself understanding it without really understanding it. Yeah, it's *that* weird. It's also a film that is bizarrely humorous while being disturbing and frightening at the exact same time. Most people don't get this movie but those who do LOVE it and find themselves returning to it again and again. I'm definitely in the latter group and have Eraserhead on my short list of all time favorite films. My daughter is also in love with Eraserhead and we frequently quote lines from it to each other whenever the opportunity presents itself.

It's easy to see why this certified cult classic is such a perennial favorite on the midnight film circuit, but there's more here than just the usual wallow in film school self-indulgence, recalling at times the morbid, tongue-in-cheek surrealism of early Bu√±uel.

It might not be a horror film per se, but the pitch black atmosphere makes it one of the most terrifying films ever made.Eraserhead is about Henry Spencer (Nance), an angsty printer who lives in a desolate industrial city and one day finds out he is the father of a terribly deformed baby. To say that it is about a man having a child is a bit of a stretch, however, since that merely provides a backdrop for a series of unnerving events. There is a lady stepping on semen like creatures while dancing inside a radiator, there is the world's most awkward family dinner with a bleeding chicken, and there is a darkly humorous factory scene that gave the film its name. Needless to say, Eraserhead is a strange film that does not quite resemble anything else that I have seen.There are two aspects that really tie the film together and make it into a true masterpiece. Firstly, David Lynch's direction is superb, not only for a debut but compared to any film. The droning score matches the abandoned settings perfectly, while the magnificent lighting gives every scene a certain mysterious aura and is also stunning to look at. All these things blend together so well, creating a singular atmosphere unmatched in his later works. Secondly, Jack Nance deserves much more praise than he gets for his role. Some might say that it is a one note performance, but even if that were true, he plays it to perfection. However, I think he displays a wide array of emotions using nothing but his facial expressions.Stanley Kubrick allegedly showed this film to the cast in The Shining in order to set them into the right mood, and it is easy to see why. Eraserhead is one of the most original films ever, and every bit as frightening as The Shining.

My mind just felt tired after watching the film. I also feel like I could not watch it again. But that will not change that I thought it was very creative and very well done. David Lynch really wanted to mess with anyone who watched this film and I believe he accomplished that. The story line was so hidden it was hard to figure out. The scenes throughout the movie though were beyond the strange. From what I can figure out, this takes place in a destroyed world. Most of the green is gone and what is left is pain. Jack Nance plays the main role. His acting was all in his expressions. I loved his expressions. I also read that the script of this movie was about three pages long. So the acting had to be in movement. Then the movie would have to rely on everything else to make it whole. Charlotte Stewart plays the girl he is in love with. They have a baby together, but because of this crazy polluted world, the baby is a bit; strange. It is hard to explain and better to experience the madness than describe it. Lynch's idea of putting mind ripping sounds throughout the film really got to me. Through the whole film it makes you very uncomfortable. I am sure that is what he wanted though. For example, the first ten or so minutes of the film is one constant sound that gets louder and louder. You almost want to pull your hair out. By the end of the film I said to myself, God what an uncomfortable movie. Then it came to me how brilliant David Lynch really is. Many will make a comedy and say that it will make people laugh. That is why many comedies do fail. But Lynch's warped mind probably thought why not make a film to really mess with people and make them feel just weird by the end of it. He made it happen and that is what makes this film excellent. There were some small things I would change in the film, but nothing to the point of a complete change because I would never want to mess with Lynch.

Nothing quite like it had ever been witnessed. Previous classics are evoked 2001 A Space Odyssey, Busby Berkeley, Universal horror, Roger Corman exploitation, European interwar surrealism. Director David Lynch presents a nightmare-scape of grinding urban industrial decay in which deep longing and pain and suffering throb. From the first moment we are in Lynch-land following his camera into dark nooks and crannies leading to endlessly mysterious crevices and niches, exploding into blinding flashes that may or may not be revelations. Through every moment there is an accompanying sound as vivid as the visuals, mostly the hum, echo and hiss of industrial infrastructure, usually decrepit, creaky, cumbersome, toxic, sickening. Every once in a while Lynch overdoes it. Early in the film members of a family behave in a self-consciously weird manner (a father whose kooky dialogue seems forced, a daughter who goes into a sudden whimpering fit, a roasted chicken that wiggles its drumsticks while oozing a dark liquid, the embryonic baby that extrudes several pints of what looks like oatmeal). These moments of overkill are ridiculous and almost ruin the extraordinary tapestry Lynch has created. The sharp and high contrast black and white photography makes the imagery all the more indelible. There is also the Lynch trademark of female opposites &#x96; one blonde and one brunette &#x96; that shows up in his later films including Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart and Mulholland Drive. The lady in the radiator reminds me of a degenerated version of Toby Wing, an insipid looking platinum blonde from Busby Berkeley movies who was always photographed grinning stupidly in musical numbers.

All that aside, Eraserhead has this strangely disturbing atmosphere hovering around with it and however impossible the film may seem, you always seem to put yourself in the situation. He calls it his most spiritual film.The actors were creepily accurate (once again, credit goes to David) and there was a constant delay with most events in the film, thus adding a hint of realism to it. However surreal it seemed, there was always a back-way which made the film seem so real, so impossible but real.This film is definitely not for the average movie-goer or for a film critic I don't care for film critics, do you?There are scenes in the film which what was new back then is what we call a Lynchian moment today. These include rare premeditation to the upcoming events, simple yet striking dialogs and a sense of unexplainable creepiness.

Not to sound clich√©'d but like many my introduction through the elephant man. I actually found this film through a horror website called losamans lair of horror. What hit me about this and many other experimental/art films was the thin line between art films and horror. I've seen art films that have been far more disturbing then most horror,like vase de noces,begotten,pig and so fourth. Yet i've seen horror that had tremendous artistic value. This film has all the above qualities. Basically the film centers around a peculiar man named henry Spencer. He is a hapless man who drudges through a black and white post industrial waste land. Yet through all the eccentricities there is something both relatible and sympathetic to our hero. He strives to live normal in a world that seems to grow more and more unstable as the movie progress's. He does normal things. He works,lives in an apartment,even spends time with a girlfriend. Things start to get a little strange from here on out. We watch as He stares over his dinner which bleeds when punctured with a fork.All the while the girls father watches in anticipation. Henry is soon informed that a child was born and he is the father. We see the child witch is wretchedly deformed to the point where resembles an unborn goat fetus. We soon see the two new parents living together,but the incessant crying of the child drives it's mother away. Leaving an already daunted henry alone with the child. A child with needs that henry can not provide for.As the time passes henry grows unstable and becomes plagued with delusions. A range of visions pass before the screen. A woman who preforms on a stage inside the radiator. She dances on the stage and steps gleefully on small fetuses. As henry watches his head falls of his shoulders and is replaced with the head of his deformed son. falling into a pool of blood. His head is then taken to a badly scarred man who runs a machine that creates...you guessed it eraser heads. He invites a woman home and gets intimate only to be interrupted by her horror at his child's appearance. Furthering in the two of them melting into each other in a bathtub.Finally in an act of desperation or madness. he slices open his child's bandages only to reallies the bandages were his body and then proceeds to stab and kill off his child. In the last scene we see henry watch in horror as his ons innards foam and he is surrounded by white light. The last image we see being embraced by the dancer from his hallucinations. This film really had no effect on me when i saw it as a young man. However when i saw later on after having a child i saw it in a much different light. It deals with a lot of the anxieties that i believe most expectant parents go through. The fear of raising a child alone, the fear that you wont measure up. And of course the overwhelming anxiety that your child will be different. Although sometimes disturbing it deals with these issues in a very sophisticated manner. The sound track that consists mostly of industrial noise would prove highly effective in later work. Filmed in a very striking black and white,It gives the film a very claustrophobic and schizo feel.

Hypnotic, fascinating, you have to see what weird or funny thing happens next. The gag with the suitcase had me laughing as hard as at anything else. I thought it was sad too. The baby's mother didn't love him, and he was always crying and got sick. I wasn't disturbed by the baby, I wanted to give it a hug. Deformed cow-fetus babies deserve to be loved too.If I can get a smidge philosophical, I think the film stretches cinema to limits it hadn't been stretched before, although Bunuel, Kubrick, Fellini, and Tarkovsky are definitely forerunners. As an adherent of Tarkovskyish views on cinema, I think this is a very good example of what he called sculpting in time, and the irrationality of so much of the movie underlines the irrelevance of plot, characters, stories, 2+2=4, etc., of cinema itself.

It was completed on a mere $20,000 budget, coming from an initial $10,000 grant from the college where he was studying, and loans he collected over the years from friends, when the grant money was over. This is why it took Lynch six years to complete production.It's the story of a few days in the life of Henry Spencer, a printer on vacation, and his relation with his estranged girlfriend, who leaves him with the mutant monster of a baby she has just given birth to. It's a post-atomic society, as we see from the atomic mushroom portrait picture, hanging on top of Henry's bed.Most of the characters aren't meant to be the representation of people, but rather that of dreams, psychoses, literary topoi, grotesque allegories maybe, but certainly not people. But here and, as the audiences will discover, in his later films, Lynch gives themes and motifs actual roles in his films, personifying certain types or characters, so that they can openly and directly show us the interaction they have with the people in the story. This is why some characters in Eraserhead have names like Beautiful Girl Across The Hall, Lady In The Radiator, and Man In The Planet.#The director defined this debut film as his most spiritual to date and, personally, I do appreciate it from a spiritual point of view; the sense of immanence of which the movie is permeated is a clear sign of the presence of a longing for something higher, an attempt to discover the mechanics behind everything and move in unison with them.This film is Lynch through and through, as we have come to appreciate him and his visions, but it does have a certain na√Øvet√© about it, and the sense of active experimentation is very strong; possibly, because of this, his best film to date.

One is, that as a very difficult movie (to bear), it has surprisingly many positive reviews here.When I watched Eraserhead I was very young, about 14 or 15, and for me it was the most remarkable movie for many many years. I didn't ever try (or was able) to interpret it besides the obvious fear of newborn children and standard family or social adapting. I remember me sitting there all the time wondering, what strange worlds movies can offer, and also wondering how familiar these strange worlds can be to me.At this time I had already seen Andalusian's Dog, The Golden Age, and some other movies like Themroc, Satyricon, Teorema and Solaris, but Eraserhead was an ultimate kick of strangeness. It has IMO an own direction of art and is definitively NOT surrealism, but it has a surrealistic appeal to many watchers. It is instead a deeply personal expression of fear and doubt, where surrealism in movies is much more a brain-game, a happening, a performance. Eraserhead begins, where surrealism ends, on a level where we begin to ask ourself how the world around us should be understood and how each of us could fit in - or not.For about 30 years I never encountered a movie like Eraserhead, and when I watched Lynch's other works I was always disappointed, like with George Lucas' works after THX1138 or John Carpenters' movies after Dark Star.I recommend this specific title - seriously! - for high school classes to watch and discuss later.

Lynch lived a small, repressed closeted life growing up and then in art school met and married a wealthy woman with Hollywood connections to get where he wanted to go. This could be the biography of most of Hollywood's giants including Howard Hughes. As with all closet cases, he seeks to find a sexual mate with whom he can find happiness but despises his own sexual orientation. This is evident in the fact that in all his movies women are either virgins or whores. He also devotes many scenes to the debasing of women much like Hitchcock. The main character and the couple's evil baby are all Lynch. He will never be a happy camper until he comes out. Cinematically, he's brilliant; as far as the plot, nothing is new here.

Henry Spencer, as played by Jack Nance, is beset by a neurosis which gives his world-vision the aspect of Stalker-designed Tarkovsky or Orson Welles' The Trial. Indeed Kafka might be as good a way as any to approach the elliptical purpose of of Lynch's film, given the Alien- presaging progeny at its centre.As I've indicated, for all that this is a bizarre, unreal film it has a linear (if easily digressive) narrative and consistent pockets of wit. What it also has though is true horror in its insistent, industrial sound design/score (the director's own) and subject material that makes Rosemary's Baby seem like simple black humour.

David Lynch's portrayal of a nightmarish world is beyond imagination and totally unpredictable. Telling what it's about doesn't really do any good, that's part of the point of this movie, is to figure out what's really going on for yourself. The answer is different for everyone because it's messages mean something different for everyone.Don't go into it expecting usual David Lynch, it's not a movie with a straight-lined plot. When I first started watching I had that wrong mindset and thought it was kind of boring. But after watching again I realized you can't try and figure out what Henry's doing or what's happening while watching. Just watch and take everything in and let your sub-conscience think about what it means. Though slow and bizarre at times there is a lot going on, possibly multiple sets of symbolism and that's what makes it difficult to get a hold of, if you're too focused on discovering the meaning. The message is dark and disturbing but important, and in the end, I personally believe, has a positive note to it.It's not for everyone but if you like stuff that makes you think, or like really weird stuff, watch this movie. Or if you're just tired of the usual, hero fights against enemy-saves crowd-sleeps with a girl-gets rewards type story; I'm not sure what category Eraserhead fits into, it probably doesn't. It's a masterpiece of abstract art that deserves more attention. I wish there were more movies like it.

Beneath the polished surface we are in an evolutionary state of flux, an experiment in progress, a mass of test tubes and bubbling flasks on a mad scientist's desk, unstable, barely reliably human. Biological functions sex, eating, childbirth, become disgusting and terrifying. The threat of illness and dysfunction, when you are aware of it, seeps from the very walls. The dog with its slobbering brood shows that such things have to be done automatically - you can't think about it or the demons creep in; to look inward is to look down. Mind and biology; the absurdity of the disparity. The external world, the artificial social world we live in becomes an ironic joke.The really great thing about this is that it all obviously means something - it's mesmerising to watch - but it takes a lot of thought to figure out what - evidence, no doubt, that it is truly tapping into the subconscious. I'd somehow forgotten about the cutting of the baby's bandages - what a stunning scene that is.

Usually people fear what they don't understand and in movies viewers usually tend to give up on the movie if they don't get what they're watching. But, not this movie! The minute you start watching you realize that you have no idea what's going on, however, you are attached to the screen and you want to understand. There is a certain sense about the movie that drags you to the end of it because you refuse to feel stupid. Definitely there is a clear indication to the nuclear era and this appears evidently in the deformities of the characters. The gloominess of the places and characters is another obvious suggestion of the war times and how they affect people mental well-being. Despite all this, you can't but focus on the central character of Henry who seems to be a person void of everything but his sexuality. His world is so empty as his house and you never know anything about his life but the fact that he works in printing and his lust for his neighbor and the blond woman in his head. This is another genius interpretation of what becomes of a depressed person in a war society with no pleasurable act but sex.Eraserhead being written, produced and directed by David Lynch is definitely a vision. I can only say that this work is a jewel that is similar to a wise book which includes the knowledge or discovery of one person and must be experienced. There are lots of smart/genius details in the movie that hold so many intellectual interpretations that the viewer needs to pay attention to. The old lady in the kitchen who sits like a dead person and the mother makes her shuffle the salad. When Henry takes the knife and the chicken bleeds. When the mother licks Henry's neck. When Henry's head is used to sharpen pens! This is like the most beautiful and smartest symbolization of a human's head in this era. We have no heads of our own anymore. Our heads are just pencil's sharpeners for the politicians who are writing our destiny.A movie to the brainers only!

He pulls all the strings, or levers, to get things made.Mary X is his muse. She comes and she goes, and she sticks him with his unformed idea when the going gets rough. (See ya! Sucks to be you!) The Lady in the Radiator represents the root of performance (the stage, obviously), and she demonstrates how performers can both help and hinder aspirations of filmmakers.In his own worst nightmare, he's forced to edit (erase) his own artistic vision---represented by the beautiful woman across the hall---and that's why killing his baby equals killing himself. Asking him to make changes is a castration (or, if you're a sick bas+ard like Lynch, a decapitation). The Man in the Planet pulls a final lever, sending actor and director together into either bliss or oblivion.That's my two cents.

I hadn't seen Eraserhead since it was released in art theatres over 30 years ago. At the time I was living in a garden apartment in Chicago not much nicer than Henry Spencer's in this film. After seeing the film I found it difficult to open the door to my place. It was winter, it was raining and the steam radiator was hissing loudly. You get the picture.The result was that I automatically blocked-out most of what I had seen and did not return to this Lynch classic until now. Like most people I make the mistake of attaching meaning to Lynch's stuff. Maybe I get close to the mark, maybe I don't. I am not privy to Lynch's commentary on his motivations and visions for his projects, I like to figure these things out for myself. Usually, as with 'Lost Highway', I am defeated and simply watch the films like exhibitions at a freak show at the state fair.'Eraserhead' is extremely funny. Lynch at his most cynical and slapstick. At the end, when the thing (baby) is unleashed from its cocoon by Henry and grows into a devouring planet, or something, Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey' popped into my head.I can think of no closer comparison in the film world. Where Kubrick leaves us with a vision of hope and feeling uplifted, Lynch offers up something more substantial... hopeless reality and eternal groping in the darkness. The key, I think, is in that hit tune In Heaven, Everything will be Alright sung by the girl in the radiator. If you haven't seen 'Eraserhead' this will make no sense. I urge serious film buffs to give it a look-see. I may not live long enough to want to see it again but I won't ever forget it.John Nance is rather wonderful as Henry, reminding me of a couple of city-dwellers I've known in the past. Befuddled at his very existence in a nightmare world of sunless poverty and dead-end striving. I was interested to see Catherine Coulson (the Log Lady from 'Twin Peaks') credited as assistant camera operator. Like Orson Welles, Lynch has gathered a group of stalwarts around him over the years and stays loyal to them. I like that, as it is so rare in the movie biz. But that will only be of interest to dwellers in Lynch-World. This is NOT the first Lynch movie that a novice should watch. In fact it is more interesting to view several of his later works first. The zig-zag floor from the red room in 'Twin Peaks' makes its first appearance in 'Eraserhead' leading me to ponder on what THAT signifies; like the ubiquitous red curtains in many of his films.'Eraserhead' love it or hate it glues itself to the brain. Not light viewing, though possibly a party movie for those special friends who are tired of the usual crop of scrawny STARS who populate most of the junk coming out of Hollywood.

I knew it would be weird, but I was not expecting this. I like weird movies, but this makes Donnie Darko look like Titanic. Incredibly, incredibly over-the-top in its weirdness. Perhaps a few years ago, this would have bothered me, but I made a conscious effort to watch this film as a film student, not as a movie fan. Although I could easily criticize it for its nonsensical plot and exceptional artiness, I am choosing not to. Why? I really don't know.Right from the opening frame, the film grabbed me with its uniqueness. The single credit, in formal font, displaying David Lynch Presents, made it seem more like a dinner invitation than the opening to a film. The opening sequence, right up until the first shot of the factory, is such a weird way to open the picture, and yet, it works. The first line isn't said until, what, fifteen minutes in? But the film never lost my interest or caused me to turn it off - I was mesmerized. Right from the get-go, the film's unique style is reinforced, with the odd white noise present in the background, the long lingering camera shots, and the lead character's incredibly wacky hair style.The film soon becomes an exercise in trying the audience's patience. Increasingly strange and disturbing scenes interrupt long, slow, awkward moments, but it all seems to fit together. The dinner scene, the mutant baby, the lady in the radiator, the man in the planet - everything is exceptionally weird, but it just seems to work. My personal favourite sequence is a nightmarish scene from where the title is derived - Henry's decapitated head is used as the source for pencil eraser. When it ends, there's no sense of dissatisfaction, but you really don't know what to think. For some, I suppose it could be viewed as overtly indulgent, but I quite liked it.Jack Nance gives a surprisingly good performance, given the fact that the film was shot over five years; his crazy hair aside, he manages to portray both sadness and anger in equal amounts. The shadowy lighting and stark direction suit the film perfectly, and the strange characters are all realized very well. The grey, smoke-filled, almost (some would say definite) post-apocalyptic environment is pulled off excellently and the disgusting mutant baby is just that disgusting.

A style where surreal images are overtly present, and linear plot lines are thrown away in order to focus mostly on the emotions created. This style has its roots in the fact that Lynch started his career as a painter, making his films an extension of that previous work, and very different to what is the classic definition of cinema. This background is probably the reason why he tends to move away from normal films (although movies like The Elephant Man and The Straight Story prove that he can make that kind of films too), and prefers to let his imagination run wild when making a movie. His first movie, Eraserhead, is also probably the best example of Lynch's style of film-making.Eraserhead is the story of Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a timid factory worker in a nightmarish industrial work that one night, during an uncomfortable dinner with the family of his girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), receives the news that Mary had his baby. Henry agrees to marry Mary, as he truly feels that he loves her, but when Henry discovers that the baby is a mutant that cries all the time, life doesn't seem that easy anymore. Mary can not stand the screams of the child, so decides to leave Henry and return to her parent's home. Alone in his decayed apartment, Henry will have to live with the constant screaming of the deformed baby, facing his nightmares and fears about parenthood, as well as the temptations that live outside his room. And the only thing that can help him to survive is the idea that probably, in heaven everything is fine.Written by David Lynch, Eraserhead is a movie built with the logic of a dream, that is, without a linear plot and moving between a series of hallucinations and dream sequences that while apparently random, allow us to enter the twisted mind of its solitary main character. While ambiguous and cryptic, Eraserhead is an incredibly original character study about a man's fears about concepts such as fatherhood, compromise and responsibility. As written above, it follows the logic of a dream, but given it's dark nature, it would be more appropriate to say it is the vivid representation of a nightmare. Despite the apparent lack of narrative (or maybe because of it), we follow Henry closely, almost intimately, through his twisted, yet oddly very human, descent into madness as he is tormented by his demons embodied in the shape of the screaming mutant baby.In Eraserhead, David Lynch brings his nightmare come to life in a wonderfully horrific fashion thanks to his great imagination and his noticeable care for details. With an outstanding use of sound and the cinematography by Herbert Cardwell and Frederick Elmes, director David Lynch creates the perfectly haunting atmosphere of dread and decay that impregnates Henry's depressive industrial world, definitely symbolizing his bleak view of life. Many have said that Eraserhead is more a visual experience than a narrative, and I for once agree with that statement, as it is visually where we get the most clues about the film's obscure meanings, as Henry's vivid dreams and terrible hallucinations are opened windows to his troubled psyche. The pace is certainly slow, but it flows smoothly, allowing the film to express itself via the emotions of its images, like a beautiful yet frightening moving canvas.As the disturbed Henry Spencer, Jack Nance is simply amazing, as if he had been born with the sole purpose of playing this role. What I mean is not that Nance is an extremely talent performer (honestly, that is not the case), but that he managed to convey exactly what Lynch wanted to do with his character in the most natural and believable way possible, effectively making Henry Spencer a honest portrayal of a man facing his most terrible fear becoming a parent. The rest of the cast ranges from average to very good, with Charlotte Stewart being one of the latter, delivering a subtle performance as Mary X, Henry's girlfriend. In supporting roles, Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates are good, but nothing spectacular, and the same could be said about Judith Anna Roberts, who plays the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall. Finally Laurel Near is great in the now iconic role of the Lady in the radiator.While a powerful and wild exercise of imagination, Eraserhead is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, as due to the atypical way its constructed and the dark nature of its themes, it probably won't be easily accepted by those expecting a more linear, classic narrative style. However, a way to face Eraserhead's cryptic plot is to let the images do the talking and simply experience the emotions Lynch's film attempts to convey. As written above, Lynch was a painter and performance artist before becoming a filmmaker, and Eraserhead carries a lot of this background in its conception; so the watching of the movie as a visceral experience, instead of intellectual, may be helpful in its enjoyment. A very personal movie for Lynch (a lot of the film's darkness comes from his own experiences in the different stages of his life), Eraserhead is like the pure expression of the director's troubles and fears on film.Due to a constant lack of money, it took David Lynch 5 years to finish Eraserhead, but one can truly say that the wait was worthy.

It is a film in the tradition of Bu√±uel's Un Chien Andalou (1929).In this his first film, David Lynch examines the common theme of fatherhood using surreal images. He also looks at some of the issues surrounding fatherhood (marriage, the in-laws, sexual attraction, infidelity) with that same surrealism.Image is another key to beginning to understand this film. The dialogue in Eraserhead is sparse, to say the least. Like future Lynch films, much of what the director is trying to convey is communicated via the image, not the spoken word. Sometimes the image is a longer, more drawn out scene. Other times, it is a quick flash that hits you like a ball-peen hammer on the forehead.If you watch Eraserhead like you would watch, say, Father of the Bride or Parenthoood, then you will be completely lost. If, however, you watch it knowing that Lynch looks at common themes from a surrealist perspective, you will still be lost, but you'll know how you got there and will find your way back.A final word always watch Eraserhead with other people. Watching it alone is not advised.

An eerie, oppressive atmosphere surrounds everything. Lynch uses the techniques of old masters of German expressionism of shadows and light (in a Black and White movie) to create a certain estate of mind, and to shock.People, creatures and situations that only have slight resemblances with real life but that successfully strike the deepest region of your consciousness and feelings. A very slow pace does not hinder the uneasiness Lynch wants to provoke, but enhances it.Death, life and sin are part of the film. It is full of symbolisms but it is really worth it to analyse them?. If we do we will lose the essence of surrealism itself. We must experience the film, not dissect it. It is a film to feel.**** Jack Nance's performance is something to be remembered.

In an industrial backdrop full of constantly grinding machines, harsh and contrasting light, rusted metal and rotten wood, blackened buildings, and victims of grotesque afflictions of the body, you find Henry and his girlfriend Mary. After discovering Mary is pregnant with his unexpected child, Henry tries to cope with his predicament, her melodrama, Mary's overbearing parents, his lust for his neighbor, his unwanted child, and an all-around miserable existence. Their existence is complicated when prenatal tests force Mary to question if the child is 'even really human.' As Henry and Mary try to force themselves to love the child, their world spirals into oblivion as prophetic and twisted nightmares, strife between them, and a demanding infant take their toll. Eventually, it appears that Henry's only source of salvation comes from the terrible and loathsome acts he dreams and fantasizes about... or are they dreams? Ultimately, Henry's despair consumes him, and he begins to think and do the unspeakable... or does he?I gladly give this movie a 10, despite how discomforted and uneasy it made me feel, as no other movie I have seen has ever been able to wrench such a reaction out of me.

Having had the benefit of watching it with two friends who, like me, are enraptured by David Lynch's high points, I can say that I am not alone in my confusion. I don't think a coherent narrative is the point with Eraserhead, though. Like a lot of Lynch's films, it seems guided more by mood and theme--like music--than it does by an actual plot. So, even if you don't fully understand the film, it's an enjoyable piece of modern-day surrealism. Its debt to Bunuel and Dali should be clear to anyone with a passing interest in film history. Unlike those early purveyors in the unreal, I'm not entirely sure what purpose the surrealism in Eraserhead serves. Bunuel in particular used his unique imagery to make oblique satires of government and religion and the bourgeoisie; he also had a wicked sense of humor. Eraserhead is a little too self-serious and I for one am at a loss to explain the woman in the radiator's significance. Is the film about the growing dehumanization of mankind? Is it about Lynch's adolescent fascination with and distrust of sex? It doesn't matter, of course, because the vision is entirely unique. Eraserhead is an experience and as such it should be experienced--not understood.

All stories aside of his behind-the-scenes efforts to MAKE Eraserhead, it was this film that brought him international recognition, and remains well worth the time to re/visit. The first time I experienced it, I hated my friend who brought me (with no advance warning except that it was amazing). What I saw on the screen frightened me at the deepest levels of my being, and I didn't know why. As the years and viewings pass (both in the theater, and on video or DVD), I lose none of my emotional response, but gain further intellectual and formal appreciation for the artfulness of it, and lots of thoughts about the meaning. Lynch himself will NOT discuss Eraserhead's meaning, and perhaps wisely so. None the less, I believe he sees it in somewhat surreal terms (clarification being left to the individual), but was guided by the deep seated fears, confusions, and attractions that fill the Freudian world of the child, and which continue into adulthood. Most of his films since have been eerie and unsettling, but based more in realities we can recognize in the waking, every day sense. Here, the photography is gorgeous and mysterious, the SOUNDscape is perhaps the most subliminally powerful of all time, the dialog perfectly uncomfortable, and the situations right at the edge of possible. Your experience - the sort from which you desperately want to WAKE (but then return to repeatedly, as I have, perhaps 40 times now) - is never comfortable. This film takes emotional and intellectual work. The new restoration for DVD &#150; LONG OVERDUE - is of high quality. Do not let the packaging Eraserhead DVD 2000 throw you. It's only stupid, confusing layout. And, since I have you here, let me make a short pitch for AVOIDING extras &#150; commentary, deleted scenes, interviews, bloopers, factoids&#133; all the CRAP with NO value to the original work of Art.

Previously only available through bootlegs or through David Lynchs own website, this gem of surreal cinema is now on a cleaned up DVD transfer that does it justice. Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film cause I am a guy who can appreciate the strange and bizarre, I don't think this film will be a pleasure to watch for everybody.Some people find the story of this film hard to follow because amongst the main storyline Lynch squeezes in some bizarre images that I'm willing to bet only he can understand. But in spite of the strange images, there's a story about a lonely guy named Henry Spencer. Henry works in a factory 9-5 and lives cooked up in a claustrophobic little apartment in the middle of a dirty industrial city. He is soon invited to dinner by his girlfriend so he can meet her parents for the first time. Little does he know that he will get a life changing revelation during dinner.If you've seen Lynchs other films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Mullholland Dr., Dune and Elephant Man) then you know you are in for a strange and surreal ride. Its no mystery that Lynch is fond of messing with your mind and spooking the hell out of you with surreal nightmarish images, so I was ready to submerge myself once again into David Lynchs subconscious. What I wasn't ready for was how deep we were going to go.This movie really is Lynchs most disturbing film and I love it for that. I actually screened this one with some friends in my house and at one point a friend of mine turned away and said I don't want to see this movie anymore! I refuse! and he actually turned his back to the TV! I was like hell yeah! I love movies that can evoke that type of reaction, and let me tell you I understand my friend perfectly. The images and situations are deeply troubling, so be ready for some truly messed up sequences.The movie is sometimes slow, but it more then makes up for that with its visuals. After all, this isn't an action film, this film is something artful, quiet yet unsettling. You see Lynch took extra special care here in making every scene perfectly eerie, perfectly dark and very very atmospheric. The movie doesn't have many outdoor sequences but the interiors of the apartments and the sets suggest that it isn't a pretty world that Henry Spencer lives in. And even the pacing might get slow at times but trust me, when something does happen, well, it blows you out of the water. So be patient and enjoy the beautifully dark and surreal vistas that Lynch has concocted for you.One of the greatest things this movie has going for it is the sound design. There is sound in every square inch of this film and it greatly enhances a lot of the sequences.A cool thing to remember is that this was Lynchs first film ever and man, I have to tell you he was off to an incredible start. He filmed this movie through the course of six years during the time he was in film school, but Ill damned if it doesn't look as professional as all his other films.So when you rent/buy this film, remember you are in for some truly strange and bizarre images. You wont understand everything, but you don't have to. I understood the film and I really appreciate the message that its conveying with its story. There's themes of loneliness, fatherhood, abortion...the film goes into a lot of important themes.Just don't expect a normal film cause you ain't getting one. This is David Lynch after all.Rating 5 out of 5 "},{"Title":"the layman's response to lynch","Date":"21 March 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I am a huge DL fan.

What it al means? I can't quite tell, and director David Lynch sure doesn't want to tell that himself.

It is a strange, surreal dream, a nightmare, a vision, thoughts born out of fear or frustration. This film is a lot to me, and I am pretty sure it is a lot to other people as well.

You can love it or hate it, but I think it would be very hard not to be touched by the very suggestive imagery. Lynch meddled with surrealism, the aesthetics of Edward Hopper and the dark side of the soul in most of his films but it was never more gripping or convincing than in his first full length film. In Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive he made just too many concessions to the mass market, while this is a perfect symbiosis between experimental and narrative cinema. Watching it you get the feeling he was making exactly the kind of movie he wanted to, or needed to and there are just a very few films that fall into that category methinks. Frankly, you have to take into consideration that it is obviously low budget, but how Lynch employs his humble means to maximum effect is simply breathtaking and provided a blueprint for fledging filmmakers all around the world. There isn't much of a plot, the whole thing is basically a never ending nightmare about getting to grips with fatherhood, and yet that seems more than enough to keep our anti hero occupied for 90 minutes. Taking his inspiration from silent movies and German Expressinist cinematography (i.e. Film Noir), Lynch takes the audience on a tour de force through the bleakest and most depressing scenarios you can imagine. A seriously disorientated Jack Nance stumbles through an industrial wasteland, feels decidedly out of place at the home of his fianc√©e and finally cracks up in the kafkaesque claustrophobia of his hotel room. It always holds the perfect balance between sinister fantasy and drab reality so that although there isn't much acting or action to speak of you remain on the edge of your seat the whole time through. Lynch went on to make some memorable films, but he never managed to capture the emotional depth of Erasurehead again. All this said, I would like to discourage you from watching this film should you, or your girlfriend/wife be pregnant. Also, as this is most definitely an underground/independent classic, it might not appeal to your common multiplex visitor, but if you have any interest in what went on off the beaten track in the 70s, this is a pretty good place to start.

Some images in the film are very disturbing and Lynch definitely achieves his goal of disgusting the audience. The first sight of the deformed baby is genuinely shocking and considering this film was on a near zero budget, shows the talent of Lynch as a creative visionary. Lynch is an artist as well as a film maker and Eraserhead is a definite cross over between film and art.Perfectly accompanying the images are a variety of industrial noises and sounds of extreme weather. This gives a wonderful sense of your head being pounded, giving the audience an idea of how John Nance's character is feeling.By no means great, Eraserhead is definitely not for people simply looking to be entertained and is mostly suited to hardcore Lynch fans.

And, as many of us undergrounders know, one doesn't get much more bizarre than David Cronenberg or David Lynch. So, after viewing Lynch's Lost Highway and Blue Velvet it became a goal of sorts for me to locate and view Eraserhead, generally considered his first feature-length motion picture. Firstly, you really have to like this kind of off-the-wall strange kind of sh*t to appreciate a film like this. The story revolves around Henry (Eraserhead, we can assume), his girlfriend/wife, their baby and his life in what would appear to be some sort of ghetto apartment building. Really, what we have here is a lunatic montage of images and scenes that do a wonderful job of twisting viewers' faces into various shocked grimaces and exasperations. It's a beautiful cinematic piece just to watch, even without trying to figure out what the hell is happening. The imagery is eye-catching, shocking, and insane&#151;and despite the relatively slow pace of the film, it does a fantastic job of holding attention through the unusual visuals. Here's my standard breakdownThe Good--The cinematography is outstanding, as is the atmosphere and sound.--It has a feeling of a film from the 40's or 50's because of the extremely dark style of black and white photography, and the film grain (keep in mind that some of this grain could be related to the old video on which I viewed this psychotic montage).--Excellent lighting.--Lynch's direction, of course, perfectly holds the insanity together.--The special effects and shock value of the film still holds up extremely well, even after nearly 30 years.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help It--The acting is pretty good.The Bad--The style of the film and its lunatic-artsy style will be a turn-off for a lot of people, as will the extremely dark atmosphere and slow pace. But those are also the qualities that would be appreciated by fans of this kind of film, so there's kind of a catch-22 here.The Ugly--Seeing the baby all sick and covered with sores.Memorable Scene--Too many to mention, but I'm going to go with a scene near the beginning when Henry has dinner with his girlfriend's family and he is asked to carve up the chickens.Acting 8/10 Story 9/10 Atmosphere 10/10 Cinematography 10/10 Character Development 7/10 Special Effects/Make-up 7/10 Nudity/Sexuality 2/10 Violence/Gore 6/10 (there wasn't much, but it was good) Music 9/10 Direction 9/10Cheesiness 1/10 Crappiness 0/10Overall 9/10Definitely not for everyone, mostly for genre-fans and cultist movie-goers.

Anyone who is claustrophobic to any degree will find this disturbing. The song In Heaven, everything is fine which features towards the end suggests to me that Henry is trapped in either Hell or a Hell-like life where the only escape is death. However, the sequence where his head is turned into pencil-top erasers hints that even after death he'll be recycled into the same grim existence with no possibility of escape.Whether the director intended it to be interpreted as I have done I don't know but this is what I take away from one of the most unusual films around.The sound effects are great; well-worth watching with the sound turned up loud.

And Eraserhead is one of his greatest. The film is not necessarily a film of full on symbolism. Its more the phenomenal director pouring his thoughts, moods and subconscious feelings into what is essentially a fairly straight forward plot. He is interested in mood and imagery, obviously more so than dialogue. This does pit him aside from Mamet etc obviously and does limit his commercial appeal but it does not render him some arty weirdo. It is perhaps a mistake to view this film as a puzzle you must solve, unlike Mullholand dr, it is more you just surrendering yourself to Lynch's completely bizarre style and thoughts. Because more likely than not you'll just tie yourself up in knots about subtext and symbolism although I'm not saying its wrong to do this. Anyhow, instead you should just buckle up for one the most imaginative, surreal and unforgettable films in the history of cinema.

Because of this sign of impatience, they have a negative reaction to the experience. Eraserhead is a movie that is wonderful because a world is created where the viewer has never been before, making it absurdly fantastic. Lynch is the greatest director when it comes to this skill he has a knack for solving a puzzle that deals with both music and visual images, putting them together to create something powerful and extraordinary. In this film,which was his first other than his short films, the atmosphere is created through useful black and white(unlike pi which is stupid and grainy), the sound effects and recordings done by Lynch and Alan Splet, and the horrifying Philadelphia atmosphere and visuals. Because the people described above see this and have no idea what they are witnessing and can't make any sense of it, they immediately react negatively to it. What these people are doing is like taking a standardized test and coming across the fill in the blank with the correct vocabulary word section and discarding the word that they don't know the definition of. That word could be the right answer,but they discard it because they don't know what it means, which is wrong because you can't dislike or ignore something just because you misunderstand it. In this case, Eraserhead has been that unknown, discarded word for years. Which is why Lynch himself had to change the title after re-releasing it in some countries so it would have the chance to be re-discovered after the success of Blue Velvet.I am waiting for the day when the majority of audiences can watch a movie with the same attitude used when listening to music. With music, you listen and, instead of questioning and evaluating everything that is heard, you absorb it and react to its overall sound. If lyrics are sung, they generate a response based on their tone, and what the lyricist is saying is not very important. Why can't people experience a film by reacting to its tone and feel instead of something like its plot? I always thought it was funny that concise summaries of films with direct plots and pitched scripts are usually the most boring things ever. A plot does not make a movie, but rather a tone, or feeling, does. And tone and feeling are two things that David Lynch's Eraserhead have a whole lot of. This is a spectacular movie experience.

If you watch Eraserhead 100 times, you will experience 100 different films","Date":"22 July 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM****** Utterly original and unique, David Lynch's first feature 5 years in the making remains one of my favorite films of all time. Eraserhead is best described as an existential and surreal nightmare captured on film. It is highly subconscious and provokes the viewers brain, begging for interpretation. Is this film pure pretentiousness, or does it have meaning? I believe Eraserhead is a 90 minute long metaphor. It is whatever you want it to be. However, there are many consistent themes that are rather clear. ***SPOILER WARNING*** Henry Spencer, the main character, is trapped in a decaying industrial wasteland, void of real human emotion. Dialogue is kept to a minimum, and when characters do speak their voices are monotone and very slow, almost zombie-like. The characters take several painfully long seconds to respond to simple questions, which adds to the uncomfortable atmosphere. The sole window in Henry's apartment overlooks a brick wall, symbolizing how he is trapped in a state of perpetual hopelessness. In order to escape this bleak reality, he peers into a radiator to watch a woman dance and sing in heaven everything is fine. I believe the lady in the radiator symbolizes death, which her eerie, yet tranquil song supports. ***SPOILER WARNING*** The major theme of the film is raising an undesired child. Henry did not mean to impregnate his girlfriend, Mary X. The deformed, mutant baby is the product of a mistake between Henry and Mary, a mistake that they both pay dearly for. The various worm like creatures that appear throughout the film are actually identical to the Henry and Mary's baby upon closer inspection. At one point in the film, the lady in the radiator squashes several of these, which foreshadows something Henry must do to free himself of his living hell. ****SPOILER WARNING**** The closing of the film includes Henry surrendering to the lady in the radiator (i.e. surrendering to death). After dispatching his undesired child (a reference to abortion, perhaps?) Henry embraces the lady in the radiator and as they both disappear in an ocean of whiteness, which is reminiscent of the light at the end of the tunnel theory of death. How about the name of the film? Does Eraserhead suggest the human mind is capable of erasing memories, matter, thoughts etc.?Please know that my opinions and interpretations are merely my own. I am open to other peoples opinions, because the beauty of this film lies in it's abstractness. Each time I watch Eraserhead, it becomes something different. The grainy black and white visuals matched with the white noise soundtrack (scratching, hissing, clinging) creates an utterly powerful effect. When you watch Eraserhead, you descend into an abysmal netherworld that is both alien and strangely familiar. The film delves into your darkest impulses and grips you in a strangely primal way. When the 90 minutes are up, Eraserhead seems like a half-remembered dream, one that should be visited time and again. A truly unique work of cinema.  "},{"Title":"*** out of ****!

Everything in that movie happens in one day, and if you have seen the movie, it's nearly impossible for that to be the truth.  This almost puts you in the character's head.

However, I must give credit where credit is due, Lynch made time come to a standstill with this loathsome creation. The only other director that could give him competition in this regard was Edward D. Wood Jr. Ed at least has a charming eccentricity with his loopy, insane dialog and unlike Lynch he is at least trying to tell a story. Yes, I admit it, I enjoy a good story, it doesn't have to be predictable or linear e.g. Memento, but at least tell a story. Lynch is good at making you look at disturbing images. Slowly panning camera work through the industrial nightmare world that he creates here and in Elephant Man, This director is known for his artistic vision with my favorite being his filming of the evolution of the decay of vomit in Wild at Heart and of course who could forget the barf inducing cutting the turkey with icky blood coming out.That doesn't change the fact that manure is manure, much like the Jules Feiffer character in Little Murders where the character makes a living taking pictures of manure. As he says,  I've been shooting manure for years and have made a good living doing it. Just like Lynch.I have never watched such a short film, about 90 minutes, that seemed to drag on for so damned long. My son who is a budding screen writer was watching this at home one day.

Mel Brooks used the resources of his own production company, Brooksfilms, to give David Lynch his first chance at a mainstream directing job with The Elephant Man. Patton reiterates that Stuart Cornfeld convinced him to do so by dragging Brooks to a midnight screening of Eraserhead. Since I was young, I've had the utmost admiration for Mel Brooks. And let me tell you something sister, E-Head's unsettling.I hate this movie.Slimy slithering intestines don't flutter my fancy.Did that sentence make you feel gross? It should; hopefully it scares you away completely. Because that's all this movie does; it seeks to disturb the viewer. So in that department Mission Accomplished, Mr. Lynch.This is by far his worst.It's smart; don't get me wrong. But originality only goes so far with me. When the ride gets painful, stars begin falling off. It's not fun, enjoyable nor educational.Some consider it thought-provoking. I don't.To be more specific, Eraserhead is about the fears of fatherhood. Despite the cover, it doesn't disturb in a manner akin to horror flicks.It's about depravity and inhabits it's own dark shred of sadness that doesn't require a specific genre. Let's call it what it is A student film.There's a lot I don't like.In particular, I really hate the fetus-stomping blonde (or Lady in Radiator, played by Laurel Near) with the fatty cheeks. It's never fun when she shows up; out of tune and singing the saddest song ever. Any scene involving the deformed baby, its grotesque skin disease or the anxiety-inducing wail of sorrow; I'd happily discharge from my brain. It's the single cringe-worthiest hundred minutes of my life. And I've seen a couple movies that'll convert an entire nunnery.Jack Nance as Henry Spencer is very good.The Girl Across the Hall (played by Judith Anna Roberts) is also solid. She dons a low cut dress and walks with a sinewy strut that'll entrance.But all the acting is good, I suppose. Allen Joseph as Mr. X is an oddball who offers the only chuckle.Lynch apparently likes featuring scenes of a spotlight on an empty stage. The shame idea shows up in Mulholland Drive. I don't know what the hell with to do with it.More often I wonder whether it's worth the ponder.Towards the beginning, Henry traverses squat mounds of ashy dust while a train whistle blares in the background. Considering the subject material, I wonder if it's in reference to Ernest Hemingway's Hills Like White Elephants. That short story's about debating abortion and a couple torn up by unexpected pregnancy.And it's Hemingway; it's wildly unpleasant. But much more enjoyable than Eraserhead.Okay, I'll slow down with the pessimism for a moment.To be honest with you I could hate on this movie a lot more than I'm going to. It has redeeming qualities but they bring the rating up to a whopping one star. I'm not mad about it; it's just not what I go to a movie for.These moments of redemption are few and far between. There's a lot of intricate camera angles involving shadows and how they fall on the characters. Even the majority of the smart stuff leaves a bad taste in my mouth! Like the leafless twig thrust into a pile of soil upon the nightstand. Dirt granules certainly spill onto his mattress on occasion.There are two particularly noteworthy scenes. They're both gross and unsettling, but somehow they shine amidst the pit of yuck.When Henry's in bed with a woman, they're wrapped up in the sheets like a spider, and her teeth are chattering like she's freezing. The spindly way she's twisting, contorting and toiling amidst the covers is creepy and discomforting.The other scene involves Henry making love to a woman, and their infidelity descending into milky white tub water situated in the center of the bed. It's a beautiful shot and really a thought-provoking scene with a fascinating dynamic.But even then, it's still pretty unsettling.Ugh! There's so much filth in Henry's room. The sound effects and score are constantly ghoulish, grotesque, creaky, whistley, shadowy, lurid, crackly, scratchy and overall irksome.It's an Odyssey through disgust, silt and darkness. And it's the rockiest ride amidst a meteor shower.Do yourself a favor and skip Eraserhead, and check out Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet instead. Only the biggest of Lynch's fans will like this. It's 'un-good.'By the way, I don't know what he saw in it, but I still highly admire Mel Brooks.Looks like it's time to catch The Elephant Man.

And if you know that his background is actual in art (specifically painting) rather than film, the images he puts on screen may make a good deal more sense -- he is much more concerned with a visual presentation rather than any sort of coherent plot.While the film is certainly more bizarre than Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway or Twin Peaks, those films (and more) give a hint that Lynch has a unique vision. (If you have seen his short films, including Alphabet, then you know exactly what to expect.) How do you review this film? You will like it or hate it, probably. Howard Maxford seems unsure how to categorize this film. In his brief review, he calls the picture clever but ultimately depressing, boring and an alienating and tasteless experience.The film is bizarre, has no real plot (the brief version written above is really a stretch and ignores the pencil factory, man in the planet and woman in the radiator). And how does Sissy Spacek tie in? Mel Brooks loved this film, and because of it offered Lynch The Elephant Man, quite possibly Lynch's biggest critical success. Stanley Kubrick also loved the film and screened it for the crew during production of The Shining.Lynch fans who have not seen this one need to see it. Others may not need to see it, unless you like a dose of the surreal (if you liked Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou then you will love Lynch).

Where the best filmmakers seek out ambition and strive to create a film that extends beyond their imagination, David Lynch was able to come up with a film that is easily one of the most disturbing and surreal films I have ever seen. Eraserhead has amazing black-and-white cinematography. Lynch takes us into another unnamed world where feeling is all that matters. This is the 3rd film I have seen from him (the others being Mulholland Dr. and Blue Velvet) and it is obvious that David Lynch works on creating a sense of dread and a frightening atmosphere that lingers towards the viewer in a hypnotizing manner. That is proof of great direction, and even though the film is completely different in terms of storyline and look at first, it definitely has his trademark on it. The film has very little dialogue, and it works mostly on surrealism and dreamy images, but to me what matters most in a film is how it makes you feel... the plot, characters, writing obviously have some part to do with this, but the direction is what Lynch's films dwell on. It is all on feeling, and for that reason, even though the film is very slow, I could not once look away. All in all, Eraserhead is an imaginative and disturbing film that proves to be one of the strongest film debuts ever from a director. It proves why films like this are popular, and why this film deserves to be a guide for other directors trying to learn something about creating a real horror film!

Someone mentioned Kafka as a reason to denigrate this film. I have spent a lifetime admiring Kafka's work, every word of it, and I'm not even through. With Lynch, I had liked 'The Elephant Man,' and a few other films, but had a basically negative attitude toward him as being pretentious. Strangely, this movie just captured my mind completely. I watched fascinated. Those who want to hunt symbols can put equal signs between a detail in the movie and their bloviations, but that's not how symbolism works. I'd say I re-experienced the hideous sleeplessness of the first months of parenting, but I just don't see the worms as spermatazoa. The nightmare family of the 'wife' is right out of Kafka, but the singing lady with the doughy cheeks is absolute;y original - and brilliant. This last image scared me more than anything else in the film. What power that image packed!

Start with a very strange young man who isn't half as strange as the rest of the characters. Throw in a marriage and the offspring of that marriage, a lizard who is quite ill. These people are trapped caring for this thing, not knowing exactly how it appeared or why. There those Pinter like pauses and odd statements made at the oddest times. There is no future that anyone can recognize; where are they going. There are scenes of people dancing and stepping on the heads of more snake-like creatures, cruel exchanges, a man's head being severed and made into pencil erasers.

This NOT a film to take a first time date to, nor is it one to show at family reunions (unless your family is that dysfunctional).

The film's full of symbols that suggest this (and I've heard that reading Freud's Interpretation of Dreams helps you unravel them). Two of the most obvious, I think, are the tiny chicken that bleeds, representing the breaking of the hymen when Henry has sex with his girlfriend (why else would the mum react like that and why else would she announce that the daughter's pregnant straight after that scene?) and the girl in the radiator, who represents an abortionist she's both attractive and repulsive, like the idea of abortion for Henry.For example, the moment Henry touches the abortionist, who's been encouraging him with her song about heaven and her smile, he's released from the dark, troubling place depicted so well in the film (worry, fear and guilt over the pregnancy) into pure light (release from it all). Not only that, after he touches her/accepts the idea of an abortion, you hear the suction used in the abortion procedure and see what looks like a fetus, umbilical cord and placenta being sucked away! Maybe Lynch was also commenting on post-industrial society, but I'm more inclined to think that the constant industrial sounds in the background are more for atmospheric effect -- or maybe they even suggest the constant mental noise and confusion in poor Henry's head! There's probably much more going on in this film than that, but I'm actually more inclined to not over analyse it and just enjoy (or not...) the uniquely disturbing and uncomfortable moods and atmospheres Lynch has created in this film.

None of the characters is likable (in my opinion); in fact, they're strangely emotionally shallow and small-minded, and they would be mundane if they weren't so bizarre; but all are interesting.

Then he has to take care of it.That's just about the best way to explain it, but there is really less of a story here than just an emotional throughline with the films visual imagery that is clearly visible, but hard to relate to. This is because the film is so esoteric, such an exhibit of Lynch's pure ideas, that it is incapable to relate to unless you were involved in the production. That being said, you feel sympathy for the characters, even if they are given a little too less time to grow, as the story soons sheds them to focus on Henry. Henry is a sad individual tasked with taking care of a child that burdens his every move. He's a guy you can feel for, because parenthood is an experience everyone can sympathize with. It's hard, and even harder by yourself.However, soon things go completely out of hand and body. The film becomes one large symbol for something else, and things may have a certain subconscious power, they, on the whole, don't mesh together or make an attempt to relate to you, like most other films would do.That being said, Lynch's imagery is bizarre and mesmerizing, and sure to captivate you throughout the movie, and cause some serious intellectual discussion of differing interpretations afterword.Eraserhead is well-done and its imagery and sound-design meticulous and inciteful, but the esoteric nature of the film's story will fail to relate in most peoples heart.

The few dialogues that take place - even though mostly weird - give a little bit of a breather. Hard to watch, especially repeatedly, this is definitely not entertainment in the classic sense. Nevertheless, it is utterly fascinating. Hard to believe that it was directed by the same David Lynch who gave us such beautiful-people yuppie-mystery crap like Twin Peaks, and who started casting Laura Dern in his films, probably because he saw talent in her.

Is a cult film a film that lacks many of the components of a mainstream film, but somehow or other is able to garner many fans through its artistic merits, bizarreness, racy humor, etc.? If so some films like Kevin's Smith's Clerks and Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise might rank highly in some circles because of their use of black and white film and their ability to find humor in the mundane life. However, what about the films of Kitano Takeshi and Miike Takashi? Their films are vastly different, but they are both labeled cult film directors in the West. Maybe it is because they are Japanese. As one can tell when one goes to the local video story, if one wants to rent a foreign film it is automatically in the art film section even if they were quite mainstream in their home countries. What am I trying to get at here? I am just trying to say that the label cult film is just too easy to use. I mean, come one, do you really believe Kill Bill is a cult film when it garners millions of dollars at the box office. Who knows? It is up to the film viewer to decide. The reason I am bringing this up and why I went into the blurb above is because I've just watched one of the films that I have known as a cult classic for around ten years, but I have just gotten around to watching myself and that film is David Lynch's Eraserhead.Upon the films opening and it scenes of an urban wasteland of concrete, steel, and dirty water, the first thing I thought was that I can definitely see where Tsukamoto Shinya received his influence for Tetsuo the Ironman. Eraserhead tells the story of Henry Spencer a young man who works for a printing company, he is now on vacation, and who sports some very impressive hair. After returning to his apartment one day, the woman across the hall informs him that a woman called for him and invited him to dinner with her family. This is Mary X, and Henry goes there reluctantly because he has not heard from her for a long time. Within Mary's home we meet her parents. Mom is quite overbearing, Dad likes to cuss a lot and talk about his old injuries, grandma doesn't talk much she jut helps tossing salads and smoking, the dog seems to have just had puppies. Within these environs and after a dinner which consisted of Henry piercing a small cooked chicken that started twitching and bleeding, Henry learns that he is a father. However, he is the father of a monster not a baby. Henry and Mary decide to get marry and raise the monster, but Mary can not handle the monster's incessant crying and leaves it with Henry. Henry could not care less about it, but it seems it is also the least of his worries because some other bizarre things are happening. His radiator seems to be possessed by a woman with horribly puffed out cheeks and his head seems to fall off sometimes&#133; David Lynch's Eraserhead is definitely a trip into the bizarre, and I do believe that it is one of the strangest films that I have ever seen. Does the film actually have a plot or a deeper meaning behind it? Hard to say, but some believe that it shows the difficulties of taking on adult responsibilities such as raising children. However, does the film really need to have a deeper meaning to be enjoyed? Maybe one should just sit back and enjoy the ride.

There are no cracks in the worlds he creates, unless he puts them there. He makes no concessions to genre conventions because he has created his own genre. Eraserhead, which shares genes with Lynch shorts like The Grandmother, was his impressive feature film debut.Many horror films have been described as being akin to nightmares. Eraserhead is more logical than some nightmares, but it is as deeply troubling as the worst nightmares. It derives directly from one man's subconscious fear of being a father and losing control. It gives us a literal representation of that fear in the form of a deformed baby (ghoulishly realized) and serves up increasingly outlandish imagery that grows as a reply to the protagonist Henry's (the late Jack Nance) dilemma.The sound design by Alan Splet and Lynch is extraordinary and makes a clear case that sound is responsible for 50% of a film's power. The aural landscapes possess an engaging, transporting quality that add a deep dimension of grave unease to the spectacular black and white photography by Blue Velvet DOP Frederick Elmes.The film is impossible to categorize and not possible to adequately decipher.

I could also add that he fantasizes about a world that exists behind his radiator, where a woman with oversized cheeks steps on worm-like creatures and sings songs about everything being fine in heaven.  And I couldn't forget to mention the strange planet inhabited by a scarred man behind a set of levers that appear to control....See?  What's the point.  Summing up the plot of Eraserhead is a ridiculous thing to do because it's not about its plot.  It's about the finer details of the film.  Without a doubt the most striking feature of this movie is its sound design, which adds greatly to the overall tone of the film.  The sound design that makes the whole experience feel eerie and somewhat wrong, that makes you feel trapped in Henry's world.  The next time you watch this movie, notice that there isn't one frame of the film without some sort of everpresent ambient noise, be it the sound of steam going through pipes in Henry's apartment or a litter of puppies suckling on its mother at the X house.  The only silence in the film comes at the end, after Henry embraces the woman behind the radiator.And the high-contrast black and white photography.  I thought it was a bit pretentious of David Lynch to include instructions on how to adjust your TV to make the film look better, but he's right.  It shows the painstaking detail he adhered to for the photography of his greatest film.  The shot of his neighbor walking out of the darkness and into the light before she asks to spend the night at his place is utterly breathtaking when viewed in this way.And that's what makes me so happy about the cleaned-up DVD release of this film.  I always had to watch third-generation copies of someone's bootleg Japanese VHS copy with Japanese subtitles.

To me this movie is the equivalent of some 'painter' randomly splattering paint and swinging a brush against a canvas. The 'artist' doesn't even have to explain anything, just give his work an obscure title and due to the mere fact that it can be connected to anything the viewer wants, it is transformed by criticism into a 'mysterious unexplainable masterpiece'.To go against the general opinion is kind of like swimming against the current but if you look at what the general public has accomplished in the past, you could only describe them as asinine, delusional and amnesic. Which, in many cases gives me all the more reason to doubt the validity of the general opinion.In my opinion, this movie is just a deranged mess of ideas, held together by many moments of awkward and nonsensical moments.

I think I would've enjoyed it better had I skipped the movie & just read the reviews and learned that it was supposed to be about an alienated man in a depressing industrial who suddenly has a monstrous baby. If only I could've gotten that from the film. Instead I stared at piles of hair, a deformed warty chipmunk woman, and a alienlike giant spermatozoa being stabbed to death while people hallucinate. I wasted the entire film searching for meaning.... trying to figure out what the piles of hair?/hay? were for? What alien looking spermatozoa had anything to do with what was going on?... etc.Just a few hints could've helped make it a good film... there were things that if explained would have been more enjoyable and seemed interesting... the ominous/abrasive music, the creepy mis-en-scene (the elevator that hesitates, the radiator, the dead tree in dirt, etc.)This film is in no way a work of genius. I've seen films that deal with alienation & isolation. There are tons of films out there about the fear of parenthood or the feeling that your child is an evil entity (Rosemary's Baby, Omen, Bad Seed, etc.) You CAN convey these emotions in a coherent/logical fashion and have a plot/make sense. This just added to my internal debate that David Lynch movies provoke Is he literally schizophrenic and unable to process reality the way most other people do? Has he taken too many psychotropic drugs? I even tried watching the interview with him after the film on the DVD and was unable to bear it. He seems lost in another world and just rambles.People seem to like this film simply because it's shocking & experimental. Sorry, but that's not enough for me. I'd rather have something that's original, pushes the envelope but ALSO be interesting (or at least not like watching someone's disjointed nightmares). I took nothing away from this film - and that makes me feel like I wasted my time.I give it a few points for 1. No T&A, no sexism, no racism, no homophobia 2. No product placement 3.

But for those who just want to read my comment on the film, you may do so. So the beginning of how I found this film was very strange. I kept looking at what films people were talking about all the time. And I knew the director David Lynch at the time, but never seen any of his films. I always kept seeing the cover of Eraserhead and hearing the title everywhere it felt like. I was saying to myself, is this film any good? So I decided to check it out and get the DVD.....i've never felt the same since.This film really changed my ways at looking how directors make these strange, bizarre stories that are surreal. I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's films, and I have seen all of his and then Eraserhead, and I got to say, Eraserhead is a bigger step towards figuring out and questioning these movies. Eraserhead is perhaps not for everyone, but for people that love to 'think' in these films, (for example 2001 A Space Odyssey), then this is a good film for you to watch.There is really no explanation of this film. But so far its basically about a man who lives in an industrial enviorment, is struggling with certain things in his life. His mutant baby, his girlfriend, and a whole mind full of things on his mind. He starts having hallucinations of these bizarre characters, and crazy dreams. However the film is intended to not make perfect sense. It presents a totally different look in movies. It also probably gave some influence for other directors, like Tim Burton, who has made so many off-the-wall characters in his films.In my opinion, I think this film should be acclaimed as one of the best surreal/horror films in film history. An experience that will leave you stuck there wondering what your thoughts of the story means. And the funny thing is, the director David Lynch doesn't explain what happens in the film, or really anything that makes you guess what its about. So if you think about it, its pretty creepy how the film is left alone by itself, and maybe.....this film has a big significance, that we all can't figure out.

I was very impressed. I had heard about the movie a while before then, but didn't get interested in it watching until recently. A friend mentioned having watched it to me, so I decided to watch it. It was like nothing I had ever seen. It was also the strangest movie I have ever seen, yet one of the most original. I admire David Lynch for this achievement.While looking on IMDb I noticed that the opinions on this film were mixed, ranging from a masterpiece, to a waste of time, and boring. It could indeed be argued that Eraserhead is a masterpiece. Many reviewers said the movie was hard to understand, or that it had no plot, or that it didn't make any sense. I think the film will make sense, if you pay attention to it closely and analyze it.That's the thing about Eraserhead; unlike almost any other movie, it challenges the comprehension of the viewer. There were a few very puzzling scenes but apart from that I understood Eraserhead. I think these peculiar scenes, that leave the viewer scratching his head, are best how they are. Not everything in this movie is supposed to make sense, and some of it isn't going to; its going to weird you out. I mean, a lot of movies have weird scenes. Some have very weird scenes.Eraserhead takes the cake. It's just downright weird. A lot of scenes may be disturbing, but if a weird scene make no sense, it's going to be even more disturbing. That's part of what I liked about Eraserhead. I also believe the film does have a plot, and a pretty good one. It is just an abstract one. The plot of an abstract film is going to be very different from that of a normal film; viewers should understand this. Just because a plot is different or odd, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.The film does start off very slow, but it picks up after that and delves into the story of the movie. I also noticed that some reviewers said that this movie is better if you don't classify it as a movie but instead as art. Well, I wouldn't go that far. No matter what you call it, it's still a movie. Now, for the story of Eraserhead. Eraserhead is primarily a surreal tale of a taciturn man living in an apartment in a barren town, who is coping with bad insomnia one night, because of his newly born mutant baby, and his cumbersome wife.Now for how he got in these circumstances, he usually keeps to himself, but he is invited to a dinner. He decides to attend this dinner, where he meets some friends. He eats with about four other people. It is there that he finds he has impregnated one of them, and she has delivered the baby. He is also informed that the baby is premature, which is presumably why it is mutant. He experiences a lot of visions during this night. I call them visions, but some could just be nightmares. Others are supposedly happening in real life.It is in these scenes, where the viewers may find themselves lost. It's really not that difficult to tell which is which though. Eraserhead does start off very slowly, but it gets better and better. I would recommend it, if you are interested. I would not recommend this movie to someone just because you are a horror movie fan; however. Eraserhead is sometimes classified as a surreal horror, which is true, but in this case a surreal horror is a completely different animal from a horror. I am myself a horror fan, who liked this movie, but I think part of that is because I really like surrealism. I can see a lot of horror fans disliking it. Eraserhead is a very good film for its genre. I would recommend it to any one who likes surrealism.

On the surface, it is a narrative about a man trying to cope with the uncontrollable forces of his everyday life, but underneath it holds a meaning far more sinister and foreboding.My take on this film is that the main character Henry, is haunted by an unknown, unseen demon, whose presence is indicated by fluctuations in electricity, and shifting of light sources. During a cold, uneasy dinner with his supposed girlfriend's family, Henry learns he is now the 'father' of an extremely premature, possibly inhuman child.While Henry tries to make the best of the situation, by marrying the girl, and bringing her and his 'child' home to live with him, he cannot escape from the clutches of this demon, which continues its reign of terror over Henry and his family. Mary, his wife, unable to sleep due to the crying baby, packs her bags and heads for home, but not before being seemingly raped by an unseen force at the foot of Henry's bed.The 'child' is clearly not human, and it manipulates Henry through the same type of malevolence that his true father, the demon, does, instantly feigning serious illness, and cackling maniacally at Henry's failures. Henry dreams of salvation through his savior, the woman in the radiator, but cannot escape the demons that hold sway over his life, represented by large sperm-like creatures that surface both in life and his dreams.In the end, Henry tries to kill his demon, the 'child', but only sets in motion his own demise.

After already seeing Mulholland Drive, I wasn't surprised to see that Lynch intended for individuals to make up their own minds what the movie was about.I figure myself to be an analytical person, no psychological elements left open and stuff, but you can't do that with this film. The first phrase that came to mind after I watched this movie was An alternate reality of mass insecurity and anxiety by the main character. Nothing seemed to be stable in his life. A picture of his girlfriend is ripped in half. I saw a plant growing out of dirt without a pot to hold it on the nightstand by his bed. The youngling chicken that was served at his girlfriend's parent's house was screaming and bleeding.I also saw the humor too. The funniest part was the Mother of the girlfriend tossing/preparing the salad with the old woman's arms. She couldn't toss it completely by herself so without anyone looking, she puts the bowl in Grandma's lap and uses her hands like a puppet so that the meal could be completed by the WHOLE family...of course, Grandma never got invited to dinner but she served her purpose.We live now in a cinematic world dominated by endless remakes, comic book movie overkill, and a dwindling demographic of adult movie-goers.

Now Henry has to deal with the constant screaming of the mutant child and to somehow manage to take care of it.The only way to describe this post-apocalyptic tale that David Lynch brings to life is that it is more of a piece of art than it is an actual movie to sit down with others to enjoy. This movie is disgusting, dark, memorable, and disturbing, yet, I couldn't turn my head away from this cinematically perfect movie for a single minute. Eraserhead is an enlightening experience with an almost never-ending amount of symbolism that represents a deeper and greater meaning behind what is actually shown. Some of the actions that are depicted in this film can seem completely out of the ordinary to the average viewer, and it's meant to be that way, but none of those bizarre actions go without meaning. Along with the endless amount of symbolism that goes behind the plot, David Lynch shows why he is a master at the art of film making with his incredible execution of cinematography. Within each and every shot of this film, Lynch successfully disturbs and creates an unforgettable atmosphere that will leave an imprint on every person that watches this film regardless of whether or not they actually understood everything. His use of lighting, ambient noise, shots of isolation in the setting and the shooting of this movie through a black and white camera, more than effectively accentuates Lynch's skill as a film maker. Eraserhead is not a film for every person. In fact, this movie is not even aimed at entertaining the average movie watcher on any given day. It is for those people that like to analyze and decipher the hidden messages that are presented. One can easily say that this movie isn't simply just a movie at all, but a work of art that can be compared to the works of art by painters such Leonardo Da-Vinci and Pablo Picasso.

Some viewers will find this annoying, others might want to keep view just to see what oddity will occur next.Everyone in the film really seems to capture the essence of their characters with their movements and facial expressions. The lack of dialog is actually a strength.Jack Nance gives a solid performance, he is the embodiment of a man who is consumed with fear, resentment, and the sense of being trapped. As he moves and walks around his nightmarish world he seems only mildly surprised by the dark images and occurrences around him. He seems to be too defeated to care or perhaps he feels he is unable to escape.Like Jack Nance's character, Eraserhead moves slowly, in fact, that's a bit of an understatement, at some points in the movie time barely seems to move at all.Eraserhead is an interesting movie, which has to be said for about any David Lynch.

Watch it and don't have any expectations, watch it all the way through and just experience it for what it is, clear your mind of all judgment until after the movie is over.If there is one thing about this film that no one can deny it is this, the whole piece is the refinement of an idea down to its purist idealized form, I don't know what that idea is exactly but it seems like a very dark, twisted, anxious, nightmare that is more beautiful in essence than anything you can imagine.Thank you David for a great experience in cinematic art.

The opening title scene introduces us to the main character, Harry, in the first of the film's many dream sequences. From here on we follow Harry in his day to day life. It just happens that this week, Harry's life becomes a living nightmare as he fails to cope with the drastic changes that take place for him. It doesn't have much of a storyline, the dialogue is thin on the ground too, hardly any character development takes place, and the soundtrack isn't likely to break the top 10; but this sparsity is an integral part of the film. Everything missing in this film is also what's missing from Harry's life; we're never shown that Harry has any friends or given any reason to believe he has any. We never see Harry listening to music, reading, playing sport, or in fact doing much of anything; he occupies his free time lying on his bed staring into his radiator and dreaming. Filming the film in black and white shows the lack of variety and life in Harry's world and brilliantly highlights the grim surroundings of his industrial hellhole slum. Harry is a wonderfully unique character and watching how he interacts with the equally eccentric in laws and joining him in his dreams is a very interesting experience. On top of this the film looks amazing. Harry's world is beautifully bleak and his dreams are sensational showcases of surrealism and though they lack any real point or relevance to the story, they have an enchanting strangeness about them which you can forgive Harry for loosing himself in. Eraserhead is brilliant as a character portrait or as a purely aesthetic film. As a straight narrative piece of storytelling; it makes no logical sense what so ever. But that's not exactly a bad thing.

The settings, the characters, the mood and atmosphere, everything combines perfectly to create this extraordinary experimental work that many people have grown to love, and hate as well.Is it a difficult film to get into? Yes. Will a casual viewer be bored to tears? Perhaps, yes.I love Eraserhead and I consider it Lynch's best work. Not because I like to pretend I'm an artsy person who enjoys weird, obscure stuff. I love this film because I like a film that creates its own atmosphere and makes up its own rules. Eraserhead is nonsensical, oddly-paced and downright strange, but that somehow fits perfectly within the film.The visuals are creepy, disturbing, and have a very eerie realism to them. I'll say again that it does look like a filmed nightmare. The visuals have that surreal quality enhanced by the characters and the story itself.I think Eraserhead is a proof of what can be achieved as a filmmaker and how ideas, no matter how messed up, can be translated into the screen with talent.

There are two movies that have one occurrence of music where it is instantly memorable and sticks out it the film. One is Deliverance with the Dueling Banjos, and this film with the song In heaven everything is fine . That song just gives me creeps me out and is hauntingly beautiful at the same time.It's confusing but that only adds to what the films main objective is. To make you feel like you are in a nightmare. Like a nightmare, things are illogical and doesn't make sense. Jack Nances performance is chilling as an everyman with a one of a kind haircut that must have inspired old school hip-hop artists.

Don't ask me to describe it, but it contains elements of horror, fantasy and has a surreal dream like setting that leaves you with an unsettling feeling. Filmed in beautiful black and white, the title character Henry X lives in sort of an apocalyptical industrial hell. An extreme version of the 1950s square, he has a pen procter in his shirt pocket, his pants are too short, and his hair stands on end. After eating a man made chicken dinner at the equally bleak home of his girlfriend, he finds out that she is pregnant. The offspring- you can't really call it a child resembles a skinned rabbit combined with a human? fetus, and all it does is cry. After several more surreal and bizarre events take place- like the chubby cheek girl in the radiator singing In Heaven Everything is Fine and the leech like worms Henry takes from the box in his suicidially depressing apartment, the girlfriend and offspring leave. Leaving Henry alone, more bizarre things take place. The assembly line at the pencil factory, the horribly scarred man at the control lever sitting by a broken window pane. Does this represent human conception, is he God, or are we being taken to another planet? Film does not give you any answers. You are on your own. A triumph of design, the dreamlike ,trance like quality really gets under your skin and is further enhanced by the soundtrack which features Fats Wallers organ music, the noise of pipes and steam escaping , barking dogs and weird electronically synthesized sounds.Be careful to who you recommend this film to. They will think you are either crazy- or brilliant. A genuine, honest to God cult film, it is best viewed on a cold, rainy night. You definitely will see it in your dream. Not for the timid or easy to please viewer, this dark and disturbing movie transcends the idea of what film is, and creates a totally new form of abstract art.To this day, elements of this film continue to surface in Lynch's work. About the only other film it can be compared to is Dali and Bunuels avant garde 1929 masterpiece Chein Andalou A unique and challenging experience, to say the least. Are you up to watching it?

Lynch could have just wanted to make it into a series of images with a malevolent, nightmare-ish vibe, but I believe that there is much more to it than it merely being a tool to draw out a temporary, superficial reaction. Of course not, because I think anyone who has seen it would agree that it draws out a much stronger, chronic reaction from the viewer rather than just a spark of sullenness. I have only seen two other Lynch movies, Stay and Mulholland Dr., and from what I gathered a viewer must watch his movies many at least several times to manage to make even their own interpretation, let alone try to get close to what Lynch wanted to prevail! To give a proper interpretation of my own I must watch it again (although, unfortunately, here in Cyprus it is very difficult to find it... I have been looking for it for a year now!), but I can surely say that anyone who sees themselves as any of the following will SURELY love to watch Eraserhead-someone interested in dark images, surrealistic art etc. -someone who likes challenges of the mind and be left thinking for ages -someone who likes bizarre work -a Lynch fan pWho you surely must not be to watch it is-someone who's favorite movie is American Pie -someone who demands everything to be perfectly interpreted for them by the end of the film -someone who can only stay interested when the movie is mostly dialogue -someone who cannot be open-minded enough to appreciate or understand the expression of (a) strong idea(s) or meaning through art -someone who expects to watch a movie with a proper, sensible plot -someone who is preoccupied with the WRONG idea that Lych sucks (so what?

My few words can hardly describe what I think about this film, but I must say my repertoire in English vocabulary is not too big, sorry..;-)FOR ME THIS IS ESSENTIAL FILM-MAKING! REDUCE TO THE MAXIMUM!!! This film has no normal story-line or something. This is pure nightmare, a bad trip experience. Welcome to your deepest, deepest inner thoughts! I would call ERASERHEAD an anti-film! See this as a big, BIG compliment! Not creating a complicated story, trying to make you laugh or cry or whatever, but catching the viewers senses, crushing and mangling them, and leaving you back very very disturbed! Leaving you being brainfucked, thinking about it, and you know that you have seen a very very special and unique piece of art. I would call this a minimalistic, nihilistic statement.For sure, without those all-disturbing sound walls the film would not function in his intensity. I think this sound (...perhaps the whole film) is a big inspiration for drone groups like EARTH and sunno))), who I love and who I highly recommend to those who like and love the mechanical, disturbing and annoying sounds of ERASERHEAD.I DON'T think that you've got to be a crazy freak or a underground horror fanatic or some weird folk to love ERASERHEAD. Though I think that ERASERHEAD is not for everybody. You gotta be some kind of open-minded and you have to have the will of getting disturbed, you gotta have to have the ability to let yourself fall and be taken on a journey through darkest pictures, thoughts and sounds; some kind of masochism wouldn't be wrong;-) Maybe this IS for weird folks only..?!

It's more of a film student's exercise than a proper film, really; and if Mr. Lynch says in interviews that he refuses to reveal what Eraserhead is about because he wants each viewer to try and figure it out for himself, the only reason for saying it is that he has a mysterious reputation to maintain; or, in other words, he's full of horse manure. Eraserhead is about nothing. It's an exercise in visuals, in visual effects done at minimum budget; and homage to the German Expressionism of the 1920's that Lynch obviously loves so dearly, influences of which are obvious here but can be seen in all of his movies up to Mulholland Drive.It's painfully pointless to try to find a deeper meaning connecting all the pseudo-surreal dream-scenes in Eraserhead; it's better to just sit back and enjoy the grotesque humor, the creepy visuals and the eerie music and to appreciate Mr. Lynch's unique and strong sense for atmosphere, for his completely original freak-show vision of the grotesque and the bizarre, in the very early stages of its development. Eraserhead is the perfect preface to Lynch's celebrated career, and while most people will find it pretentious, dull and incomprehensible - which, invariably, it truly is - it's essential viewing for devoted fans of this unique director; for lovers of grotesque, dark visual humor; and for students and those interested in the history of cinema, and especially in German Expressionism like that of Murnau and his contemporaries. Remember that this is merely an exercise created by a young and enthusiastic filmmaker making his first steps as a pro; don't judge it too harshly, but also don't bother with the effort of seeking a depth to it. It's not worth it.

One could agree with that, but some also think it is also one of his greatest objectively. Even if I don't think it really is a great film, it is an interesting and innovative one that lead Lynch to further his career.Henry Spencer is an alienated and afraid worker who lives in an abandoned-like town where machines are constantly working. The world that he lives in is slow, dull, and purely weird. When he finds out that his soon-to-be wife has had a hideously deformed child, we are taken into the mind of Henry as he overlooks his child with horror.First of all, the DVD from Netflix has the picture remastered so well that I was almost shocked. Lynch's direction is very pure and near perfect. What makes the film unique is mostly the way that it is daringly executed and made, but some of it I did not enjoy much. However, though I didn't find much, I felt that there was much symbolism and meaning in the end. While I was entertained and interested by the amazing, atmospheric beginning, the film began to fall a little short of greatness by showing bizarre and at times disgusting imagery. The baby effects are dated, yes, but the idea that Lynch gives about the world we're living in is growing shorter is brilliant. Throughout the movie, not much dialog is even given between characters. Lynch is reflecting on the quietness of Earth (or is it?). Is it a post-apocalyptic world, or is it just an experiment of an environment gone bad?Overall, I would say that this is Lynch's purest film, though not one of his best. The direction and cinematography are perfect for a surreal film, though I am not sure how many will be fascinated by random, bizarre imagery.

Who can relate to Henry Spencer?  That he is in hell is apparent, but who can understand the particular hell Lynch shows us?  Ironically, through this totally foreign projection of existential strife, the redemption shown at movie's end becomes plausible.  Since we can't make sense of Spencer's hell, we are forced to accept the unfolding events as redemptive in a more intuitive and deeper way.  Strangely, Lynch achieved the highest goal of narrative art while heading 180 degrees in the wrong direction.That said, I would be irresponsible not to chime in and remind potential viewers that Eraserhead *is* a disturbing film.

The imagery, sound, pacing and disoriented timeline create a wonderful sense of foreboding and anxiety. Eraserhead is a beautiful, funny and ultimately very disturbing film.

Examples of film noir include Casablanca, Vertigo, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, Fight Club.  They are films with a central character (usually male) that is in a desperate or confused state. He is usually seduced by a classic femme fatale who often has some alterior motive. He usually falls in love with this woman, begins to trust this woman, and then is betrayed by this woman.  Other characteristics of film noir include feelings of distrust toward society, the government, or just the world in general. Film noir is usually filmed in dark, dreary outdoor environments or in dimly-lit, seedy motel rooms. They are often black and white and use bright light or music only to symbolize hope or sanity. What's my point?  Take these characteristics of film noir and apply them to Eraserhead.  Now think about how ridiculously these characteristics are portrayed in Eraserhead.  Lynch seems to be poking fun at serious films noir (to the extreme).  This is satire at its best. Eraserhead may have virtually no entertainment value, but David Lynch is a genius.

David Lynch was either a weirdo or a psycho when he directed this movie. I don't know how this movie was made to be so eerie and omniscient maybe it was the black and white film that made all of the blood effects indistinguishable from the real stuff. Maybe it was the incredible make up work used on the baby thing and the Woman in the Radiator. Maybe it was the sound track throughout the film. There was always some type of noise constantly going on, whether it be a rain storm, some type of metal creaking, the radiator hissing, or the baby's constant crying, but it took a toll on the viewers' toleration. Like Mary X, you too will eventually lose your mind and become very paranoid.I am VERY happy that I got the chance to watch this movie more than one time.

Eraserhead's best feature is that it makes no sense, now I'm aware of the contradictory nature of that statement, as I have already belittled and criticized such other films as Fellini's Satyricon and Bergman's Persona for the same thing, but in Eraserhead it really doesn't matter in the slightest. The film follows a young man named Henry Spencer (a bizarrely coiffed Jack Nance) and his girlfriend Mary X. The fist part of the film shows Henry mooching around the dilapidated industrial bombsight that seems to be the earth before going back home to his apartment to sit on his bed and stare into his radiator?

But the questions it raises makes the film, you can try and interpret the images as much as you want, but only Lynch will ever know what the film is about.After the most disturbing meeting you're partner's family dinner scene ever committed to celluloid we find out that Henry has fathered a child with the spasmodic, twitchy Mary, and pretty soon Mom and Dad have made sure that Mary and child are living happily ever after with Henry. This being David Lynch of course, a man not know for his promotions of family values, happiness is something Henry can only dream of. This vision of happiness comes in the form of a small hamster-cheeked woman who lives in the radiator? (Once again, it makes no sense) She sings to Henry, with a song that can only be interpreted as a cry for suicide (In Heaven everything is Fine) and it's not long before Henry is having visions of his head falling off and being made into an eraser tip for pencils.Lynch takes the ordinary and the mundane, and mixes it with a stunning sense of avant gardsim; his interpretations of commitment, sex and childbirth are all made clear. The child that Henry fathers is no real child, but a deformed slug, constantly crying and screaming until he has successfully driven Mary back to her parents. In one scene towards the end, Henry is turned away by the mysterious Woman across the Hall, he watches through the keyhole as she cavorts with a balding, middle-aged man, until his baby begins laughing at him. Eraserhead is a bleak and gloomy film that one must see at least five (?) times before the initial shock of the film's surrealism finally is erased, composed in constant darkness, with a soundtrack that has a unvarying hum of industrial machinery.

I thought a little and answered About people. They were disappointed by the answer, but nevertheless I didn't find anything to add.I think that it is easy to say what a bad movie is about (briefly retelling the plot) but it is almost impossible to do this for a good movie. It shouldn't be about anything. It is about everything. The artist creatively mirrors the world on the screen. And as the world is tight together and it is difficult to separate something from it without simplifying it to a certain extent, so a work of art should be taken as a whole. And one more point A work of art is not `What You See Is What You Get', it is much more what you see is what you have to think, feel, learn, experience. Since then, no one can tell the truce about a work of art. One can find (create!) the truce inside himself. But this demands not to watch passively a show, but to make your mind, your soul working while.All these words I have to tell because `Eraserhead' leaves nothing for those who used to the usual way of telling the story, usual way of depicting the world. It breaks up all the common cinematographic, and even human, standards for how the world, people can be perceived.Sometimes it seemed to me that this all is about how would an extraterrestrial being perceive humans. Sometimes it seemed that those extraterrestrial beings are already in our unconsciousness and looks out to the world without any rationality, without keeping all the common `how it should be'.Lynch creates a world without any kind of spirituality. Men and women look like human beings that lost all of their humanity &#150; just flesh, and brain that is not able to manage the outside world. And the world disintegrates, falls into pieces of sensible reality that is not to be rationally analysed. This world scares. No rationality, no culture - just fear.

The film takes place in its own little world a dark, grungy, industrial nightmare laden with stark patterns, shadows, and odd details. Characters don't have much to say, leaving their odd actions and reactions to tell most of the story. There are numerous expressionist images that will truly challenge one's understanding of what's going on I seriously can't say why this film has a scene with a man on another planet, or why there's an ugly lady dancing inside a radiator, or why there are worm-like things everywhere. The film has its share of grotesqueness, from the crying of a strange mutant baby to the bizarre nightmare where the guy loses his head and it literally becomes a pencil eraser...the film packs in so much weirdness, but it runs evenly and hypnotically, to the point where it's all effortless and natural for the strange world Lynch has created.The film's content doesn't really follow a standard narrative, so interpreting its plot will depend entirely on the viewer and what he or she makes of the images. The most obvious thing is that this is about some dude having to put up with the horrors and fears of parenthood. You could probably watch the film and extrapolate psychological and sexual subtexts as well. Characters don't have much to them, but it's easy to relate to the protagonist through all his surreal visions, no matter how harrowing they become.The film uses some very strong, vivid, and stark imagery, all shot with fantastic black-and-white photography. Editing is really precise and good. All of the actors fulfill their parts well. Dialogue tends to be pretty short, blunt, and weird. This was never really an expensive or elaborate production, so considering the film's limitations, it really made the most of what it had.

On first viewing the latter was the case with me(after being so amazed by the accessible emotional power that The Elephant Man and The Straight Story gave) but after further viewings(Lynch is one of those directors where each of his films should be seen more than once) now it's the former. While Eraserhead is not quite among Lynch's best films(Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story) it is still a very good, even great debut from him, albeit with some parts that are a bit too draggy and drawn out. Eraserhead looks splendid, it's beautifully shot and coupled with the film-noir-ish lighting it's a highly atmospheric-looking film. It's not a Lynch film without surreal imagery and Eraserhead is filled with that and in a way that even early in his career is very distinctive of Lynch. The score has an eerie tension and used in an understated way, not one of the best film scores out there but it suits the film well. The dialogue is spare, only about 21 minutes worth and while not exceptional it is a long way from poor, though maybe Eraserhead may have fared even better without it(big emphasis on maybe). Lynch's direction is for a debut very accomplished if not at his best, his direction in the likes of Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive was pretty much masterly. The story is distinctively surreal and oddball but also very expertly unnerving, Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man feel more accessible but Eraserhead is essentially a mood piece and works amazingly as one. The theme of a man fearing fatherhood will resonate with a lot of viewers too. The mutant baby is incredibly creepy but there is room for some funny moments in a very low-key way especially the dinner-table scene. The acting is great, especially from lead actor Jack Nance, what was most effective about his acting was how personal it felt, in fact the whole film felt very personal. Overall, will divide viewers, it did bewilder me at first, Eraserhead proves to be a very, very good debut as well as a very, very good film where no matter how you feel about the film you cannot deny that a lot of effort had been put into making it. 9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A Dream of Dark and Troubling Things","Date":"6 September 2014","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" In the early 1970s, a young film student began work on his first feature length project, a surreal exploration of the nature of dreams and nightmares that would go on to be, in my humble opinion, one of the best films ever made. That young man was David Lynch, and the film was his work of surrealist art known as Eraserhead (1977).I first became aware of David Lynch after seeing Mulholland Drive as a teenager. While researching his past work, I began to read amazing things about something called Eraserhead, which was starting to sound like my fantasy version of the perfect midnight movie. Once I finally saw the film, I realized that is exactly what it was THE definitive midnight movie. The film has affected me not just as a viewer but as an aspiring filmmaker. The first short film I made, Dreamspace, was heavily inspired by Eraserhead, primarily in the look and style of the film but also in the themes of dreams and the subconscious. David Lynch continues to be a major influence on all of my work.The beauty of Eraserhead is in its simplicity. It tells the story of an ordinary man living in an extraordinarily bizarre, dystopian industrial wasteland. Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is a man who is on vacation from his job at a print shop. One night, he goes to the home of his girlfriend, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) to have dinner with her and her parents. After some strange behavior from Mr. and Mrs. X (Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates), Henry is soon told that Mary has given birth to a baby. Well, actually, they're not sure if it is a baby, but she's given birth to something - and Henry is the father. The couple decides that Mary will move into Henry's small, dreary apartment and they will raise the child together. When the baby arrives home from the hospital, we see that it's actually a small, dangerously premature, mutant creature that cries incessantly. After the baby continues crying and crying non-stop, Mary can't take it anymore and returns to live with her parents, leaving Henry all alone to care for the baby. And thus, Henry Spencer's trip down the rabbit hole into a disturbing, existential nightmare begins.The theme of the fear of fatherhood is the most obvious one to spot. Lynch was a new father himself when he began working on the film, and I've read that his daughter was born with severely clubbed feet, which is metaphorically similar to the deformed baby in the film. Other themes explored are those of isolation, loneliness, urban decay, and the ever blurred line between dreams and reality.The pace of the film is very deliberately slow, but, in this case, slow does not equal boring. The film is designed to lull you in to its hypnotic world; to put you in a trance and make you feel as if you are in a dream. Then, once you have been fully hypnotized, the dream slowly begins to devolve into a nightmare and it takes you with Henry into a very dark and unsettling place.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is its stark and hauntingly beautiful black-and-white cinematography. Lynch uses heavy light and shadows to reinforce the surreal, dreamlike nature of the world he has created. The direction and cinematography are handled with a simplistic beauty and a self-assured confidence that is rare in a first-time director. The decaying industrial dystopia is captured in gritty, grainy imagery that makes you feel the dreariness and hopelessness that the characters live with.Another spectacular aspect of the film that adds to its entrancing effect is its sound design, done by Lynch and Alan R. Splet. The sound is meticulously designed and is constantly present at every moment of the film. The foley sounds are done with such an incredible and painstaking attention to detail that one can only imagine how they managed to achieve the sounds they did, especially with such limited means. I read that the sound design took longer to create than the editing of the film, and if you've seen it, you'll know why. The film is a perfect example of how important sound is to fully immerse your audience in another world, and how it can increase the overall viewing experience.Jack Nance's performance as Henry is excellent. You truly feel for Henry in his plight and this is largely due to Nance's quietly introverted and sympathetic portrayal. (And kudos to Jack Nance for keeping that hairstyle throughout all five years of the production). Charlotte Stewart is very good as Mary X, the young woman who regularly gives birth to strange flagellate creatures while she sleeps and doesn't know why. She portrays the emotional frailty and ultimate breakdown of the character of Mary quite well. Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates as Mr. and Mrs. X are extremely memorable and quite hilarious. Their scenes in the home and at the dinner table, particularly with the twitching chickens, are so bizarre but very, very funny. There are also very solid performances from Judith Roberts as the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall and Laurel Near as The Lady in the Radiator that add to the beauty and alluring mystery of this stunning work of art.Eraserhead is one of the most towering examples of pure, unfiltered creativity in existence. It remains high on the list of my favorite films ever made. This is one of the films I can watch over and over again and it never gets old. It's a meticulously crafted work of dark, strange, and surreal art that begs to be analyzed and examined with a fine-tooth comb. And if you do decide to sit down and study it for yourself, I think you'll be quite pleasantly surprised at the level of mad brilliance that comes through the screen.www.themovierealm.com "},{"Title":"A man's personal journey into fatherhood","Date":"30 May 2012","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" The only honest rating one can give a movie like this is a five. It is filled with striking and disturbing imagery, it is slow-moving, and its score is minimalist. For these reasons you will either love it or hate it. It's a movie that doesn't fit into any other genres or rating systems. It is psychological to its core and symbolic in its blood.Many things have been said about Eraserhead, but it is a monster of a different breed and to truly begin to develop an opinion on the film, one must attempt to understand it.I'm going to start out by saying that Eraserhead is not as complicated as people make it out to be. Eraserhead is the autobiographical account of the anxiety experienced by a young man who is struggling with his new life as a a father and provider in a relationship which has taken an unexpected turn. Everything about the film is exaggerated and reeks of fear and dissatisfaction. From the start we feel pulled along by the man in the planet as he pulls Henry's life force out of him (seen as a sperm-like worm). Henry feels a terrifying lack of control as we can clearly see, which only magnifies his sense of isolation at the absence of his lover Mary.We sense Henry's growing anxiety as he meets Mary's family. What once a pleasant clandestine liaison between he and Mary has been interrupted by her insistence on meeting the family. Henry senses something is amiss and his feelings grow more intense as he is exposed to the family's eccentricities. He asked by Mary's father to carve the chicken, a duty reserved typically for the patriarch of a family, and hallucinates a menstruating chicken, a manifestation of his suspicion, which is confirmed in the following scene Mary is pregnant.Soon it is not simply Mary's family that is encroaching on his personal space, but also Mary herself and their newborn child. We sense that Mary and Henry have become far more distant, but also that Henry feels no personal connection to his unplanned child. The child remains a worm-like fetal abomination. Despite its infant-like qualities, Henry sees it as nothing more than a personified sperm and does his best to repress the remainder of his own worm-like sperm.He fantasizes constantly about life beyond his tiny apartment. He is plagued by the thought of sexual responsibility and through the voices in the radiator he imagines a paradise where his sexual actions have no consequences. It may not be perfect, but to him it means freedom. A world where women swallow.Mary, meanwhile feels overwhelmed at Henry's lack of interest in anything but sex and her new motherly responsibilities. She leaves him in a fit of rage, yet we can see her desperately wishing for Henry to reach out for her as she prolongs her goodbye. Henry is left to care his child, which he feels grossly unprepared for. As the child grows ill he again looks for a way out of his predicament.This way comes in the form of the attractive neighbor, whom Henry uses to escape his responsibilities. He dreams of abandoning his child for a life of freedom, but he knows that inside he was once a child too and imagines what kind of a person he would have been had his father ran out on him. He sees himself as a sperm-like child with an inability to care for himself, just as his child requires his care.This is the first time Henry feels a real connection with his child. He realizes that in order to keep his child healthy and safe he has sacrifice himself and his desires. This culminates in an elaborate scene where Henry hallucinates his own head falling off and bleeding, while a young boy takes it a factory where it is turned into erasers. The eraser dust of his dreams and desires is blown away by the hand of the factory owner. An elaborate illustration of the plight faced by breadwinner who works to feed his family.Next, Henry is faced with a hard task. He has to let go of his fear of fatherhood and embrace his responsibilities. In this final scene Henry destroys his preconceived notions about his child, through a symbolic murder of the worm-like creature. He realizes that only he has control of his actions and through his conquering of his fears destroys the man in the planet. Having accepted his responsibilities and conquered his fears he moves into the light of existentialism.It's a story about sacrifice, fear, responsibility, and single-parenthood. It may or may not be your cup of tea, but it does a remarkable job of expressing the anxiety that a new parent feels.

I enjoy movies, mostly horror and sci-fi, but movies of all genres. I enjoyed Blue Velvet because there was an understandable story but that element is completely lacking in Eraserhead. OK, so it's an art film but one that lasts for 90 minutes and doesn't really entertain. The movie starts with a fetus-like thing apparently being extracted from the title character and later the character becomes a spouse and the father of a mutant baby. The movie apparently invokes fatherhood, abortion, marriage in a highly repulsive manner. Lynch is apparently disgusted with the prospect of fatherhood or the prospect of forced fatherhood. Eraserhead's baby is a wailing, grotesque monster so I think that's a fair conclusion. Like many art movies, this is not a flick for entertainment. It's a movie to analyze the mind of David Lynch. Weird, gory, grotesque but not necessarily entertainment. 4/10 "}{"Title":"The true heir to Cocteau","Date":"11 March 2007","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" No other film has come close to seemingly combining the repulsive and the beautiful. Eraserhead is as magical as Cocteau, as visually impressive as 2001, as unnerving as Poe. Its also David Lynch's purest work, an uncompromising vision of depression. This is personal film-making at its most extreme. For an hour and a half, you are stuck in Lynch's bizarre yet complex mind. What Eraserhead means is completely open to debate. Its one of those rare surrealist films that, even if its actually about nothing, you are convinced it is a metaphor. No other film has received as many interpretations as this one. Eraserhead certainly isn't for everyone. Many will either be made uncomfortable by its unrelenting strangeness or bored (sometimes both). However, those who want to be confronted by cinema, and view it as a potentially transcendental form (as opposed to simply entertainment) need to step up to Eraserhead's challenge.Oddly enough, unlike many other art and surreal films, this isn't a cold and uninvolved experience. I have suffered from depression issues in the past, and make a supreme emotional connection with Henry every viewing. Also, while the film is unrelentingly grim for the most part, there are bits of absurdest humor that reveal themselves more and more upon every subsequent viewing (I've found this to be a trademark with Lynch films). For a film with such a low budget, Eraserhead appears to have much more scope than it actually does, mainly because of the range of the film. Nothing else I have seen so resembles a half-remembered dream, Eraserhead is one of the most poetic films ever made in America. Its not just a freak-show or self-indulgence, its a truly beautiful film.

Basically in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world of an industrial town lives big-haired factory worker Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) who is attending dinner with his girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) and her parents Bill (Allen Joseph) and Mrs. X (Jeanne Bates). Together they try to feast on chickens the size of a person's fist, but carving it proves tricky, especially when it spews blood and Mary has spastic fits. Henry then finds out that Mary has given birth to their baby, a mutant looking creature that squeaks and cries all the time, so they obviously have to move in together to care for it. Mary leaves after not too long living with her boyfriend and their baby because of the continuing screams of the child, leaving Henry to care for it himself, slowly driving him insane. To escape the sight and sounds of his baby he diverts to watching and listening to the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near) with her puffed up cheeks singing about heavenly things. There is a particular moment when madness truly hits Henry when he sees himself on the Lady's stage in a courtroom style set-up, his head comes off, and is replaced by his mutant baby. Henry's head then falls down into a street where it is cracked open, exposing his brains, and a Boy (Thomas Coulson) takes the head with brain to The Boss (T. Max Graham, or Neil Moran). A portion of the brain is put into a machine, becoming eraser ends fro pencils (hence the title), which is checked by the Pencil Machine Operator (Hal Landon Jr.), who approves the brain is perfect. When Henry returns from this dream or whatever, he can't take anymore from the mutant baby either, so he takes the very harsh decision to stab it to death, before ending the film in the arms of the Lady in the Radiator. Also starring Judith Roberts as Beautiful Girl Across the Hall and Jean Lange as Grandmother. Throughout the film you see all sorts of weird, creepy, disgusting and unsettling things, I quite like the plant in soil on a table with no pot, but the stand-out moments are of course the tiny chickens, any part with the baby, and the infamous brain scene. This utterly imagined nightmare really taps into all your senses, making you feel uncomfortable, and the non-linear narrative is up there with Un Chien Andalou, certainly a must see cult experimental horror.

Many adult and serious people i know told me that was the scariest and creepiest movie they have ever seen in their lives, not the massacre and blood and monsters Hollywood kind, but something talking to the deepest and darkest corners of your subconscious. I read audience's comments and i was promised that it would literally damage my brain cells and stick with me for the rest of my life, and such epithets as haunting, disorienting etc. -.- Well, i must say that i get impressed easily (especially with the proper atmosphere and sound effects), oversensitive and schizophrenic and very phobic by the way.... But i didn't find a single merely impressive or frightening, disturbing or whatsoever thing in this movie. And i tried hard. it didn't move a muscle on my face nor a nerve in my spine. The only emotion that i felt roused is some anger toward the personages that looked plain dumb. Except for the baby. I honestly hate kids, but what of so scary there could be about that poor ugly creature that's half ET half baby dinosaur - is out of my mind (and maybe it was the only character i felt sympathy or compassion for, especially when it was ill or being killed)... and to me a common human infant can be much more annoying or menacing... Of course it wasn't meant as an horror movie, it's 'art'. Well i must say i've gotta ponder much over it's artistic value. I love abstract art and surrealism, and the plot itself is the thing i hate most in a book or movie. But come on! The plot, despite what was said, is quite clear and definite in this movie - couldn't be more. And surrealism and stuff like that should be really talking to the hidden sides of your subconscious, provoke inner images and emotions that are difficult to categorize or identify. Here we have only plain and obvious meanings and images, all of its symbolism lies on its surface, and can't for sure be of a revelation to an average modern decently open-minded adult... yes, there can be be multiple interpretations of it, but they are all still too obvious and superficial. The matter is not that you should dig deeper - you can't go any deeper because the solid concrete bottom is too close to the surface. It can't be called boring, not to a certain extent.

I'm sorry, but both films are the same thing, just with different motives. I'll never begin to understand how anyone can find entertainment, or even something thought-provoking, in literally watching people stare at things for almost two hours. I'm sorry if everyone who gave this film a positive score had Down syndrome, but simply do not have that attention span. And, honestly, I feel sorry for those of you who do.There is very little about Eraserhead that is genuinely weird. It's a surreal take on our daily lives, nothing more. All the scenes involve shots of the lead character sitting and staring at things in an attempt from the director to make us, the viewer, feel as if we're seeing something weird. In actuality, there is not a single scene in this movie that is any more abnormal than what I see when I look around my room as I type this sentence. There are a few scenes, including the scene that reverences the title, where David Lynch apparently realizes the fact in what I just said and adds some generic surrealist moments. Black-and-white tiles, old ladies, trees, what looks like a waded-up crap&#151;all the predictable surrealist imagery you can think of makes its way into this movie.That leads to another point I've never seen a review mention Eraserhead is NOT original. If anything, it's more unoriginal than the big-name Blockbuster made by some director who has about the creativity of a dead tree stump. It takes no imagination whatever to think of something like Eraserhead. Gothic art has been done for centuries. All Eraserhead does is take the most generic of it all and puts it to motion. It's a lot like a less diverse version of Vampyr. The only sole idea that David Lynch didn't wholesale copy/paste from other artwork is the baby, and even that left me thinking about a few other movies with similar ideas. Eraserhead had zero originality, and next to no creativity.The story isn't something a lot of people feel worth mentioning because it takes last priority in the film. Most people will say the story is left up to the viewer to decide, but that's completely ludicrous. Eraserhead has a very linear, predictable storyline that has been used time and time again in films and literature before. Because the story is so paper-thin, writing a single sentence about it would lead into massive spoilers, but I will say this. I fully expected the disturbing ending from the first 10 minutes. I would have been much more surprised/shocked if it DIDN'T happen. The events of entire storyline plays out exactly like a standard soap opera, and every single one of them is predictable. Again, Eraserhead is a sad lack of imagination.The only thing I can actually complement Eraserhead about is the portrayal of emotion. The father-son relationship as somewhat compelling. The husband-wife relationship was interestingly and accurately portrayed. All the other relationships in the film were complete clich√©s, but those two stood out. But, then again, who really cares? I can see just as compelling relationships in real life, so why should I waste my life watching them in a movie that has no other redeeming value whatsoever? The effects of paranoia and nervousness are well-done, but, again, it adds nothing to the bland story.Eraserhead is a waste of time. It takes an uninteresting premise and makes it even less interesting. As a work of Gothic art, it's simply generic at best. The repetitious surrealism gets annoying very quickly. Eraserhead does absolutely nothing but make you wonder Why didn't I just walk to the local nursing home and watch old people stare at walls? Same thing as watching this movie.

Most of the film is seemingly incoherent and lacks a typical plot line that is nearly standard in today's films. This type of indecisive directing by Lynch helps to establish this film as one designed strictly for audience interpretation although Lynch himself has said that he didn't anticipate the film to be viewed by audiences at all. While this film is highly disturbing, it is also quite thought provoking and can be universally related throughout many communities and cultures.While Eraserhead is from 1977 and had access to color, it was done in black and white. I believe that this intentional lack of color was to enhance the interpretation of Henry's character. Who is Henry? What is he thinking about? Is what is happening in the scene actually happening or is Henry delusional or suffering from a mental illness? The sounds of the creature child add to the chilling effect of this film.From a theme standpoint, I believe that Eraserhead deals with a number of common concerns that are prevalent in our culture, religion, sin, guilt, shame, regret, mental illness, sexual repression and suicide. While these themes are not explicitly spoken about or even mentioned throughout the film, the tone and the symbolism that is found speaks loudly. The lighting throughout the film is quite exceptional, it helps to define the symbols and gives the viewer a deeper understanding of the dark undertone of the film. Overall, I think this is one of the most artistic films that I have ever seen and is definitely one that film lovers should experience at least twice.

Anyway, i'd say it's a very authentic and bold movie, overall. From the sceneries - the window blocked by a brick wall and the apocalyptic vibe - the eerie ways the characters seem to move inside that universe, to its surrealistic roots, i never came across anything else quite like it. It all appears to happen inside a nightmare, but whose nightmare is it, ours or Jack Nance's? Hard to tell, when some of the imagery makes us physically uncomfortable. Particularly, to me, that scene with the Radiator Lady singing, and the squashing of the mutant babies - even thinking about it makes me cringe. It's a hard movie to watch, not advised to sunny days, but are any of Lynch's films? Finishing it, i felt just like i had awoken from a nasty nightmare, only it was one i had put myself under voluntarily!

That was well done. This is an incoherent story and its f'ed up in a big way. The oozing liquid that pours out of the chicken grossed me out the first time I tried watching. I went a little farther in the film and then when the mutant baby came up, that was the last straw. I turned it off. Returned the DVD and didn't think twice about it. Until recently, when I went to my local video store and rented a bad quality copy on VHS. I got a little farther, but not much. At least I got to the part with the lady in the furnace, that was well, interesting to say the least. I couldn't take the part with the sick mutant baby, so I turned it off. Thats it, I've had it, I don't want to watch this movie anymore. One person wrote that this film is tough to stomach through, I agree, don't watch while you are eating. The movie is repulsive in its nature, but I guess thats one of Lynch's talents and I'll respect him for that. But what I don't particularly respect him for in this film, is his lack of story telling. It has great technique and you can clearly tell that he was thinking. But it doesn't fit together, it feels like a mi-sh mash of boring imagery thrown at the viewer from an obscure angle. Let me add that I love the Black and White photography, I still prefer Black and White, done well that is, not just for the sake of it. I mean don't get me wrong because I love personal films, just not this one. I love indie features because rebel nature against the Hollywood system. This film clearly finds its cult following with the midnight crowd. It has all the right ingredients to fulfill that boundary, and it does so with style, just not substance. Yes they are two different things indeed. An example of a movie with all style and not substance is 300, and I hated 300 more than Eraserhead. To even say that I hated Eraserhead would be mean, but I do feel that it doesn't quite live up to all the hype. So, occasionally I enjoy the big Hollywood boom blockbusters and maybe thats what I was in the mood for while trying to watch Eraserhead, its clearly my fault. But I have the courage to write this review of the film, therefore I must have something to say about it. Right. Well yea, I stated what I liked and didn't like, more or less Eraserhead has redeeming qualities, just not enough to out weigh an incoherent story. Like I said it's great for the midnight crowd, I just don't want to be part of that crowd tonight.

That alone got me interested, but I was turned off when I read several reviews. It seemed to be weird for weird's sake, like a mash-up of BRAZIL and the FORBIDDEN ZONE.After seeing MULHOLLAND DR., BLUE VELVET and DUNE, I was ready to accept David Lynch as a great moviemaker and storyteller. Biting the bullet, I found myself a copy of the film that had disgusted me a year and a half earlier.Wow. From those first shots of Henry floating in space, to the enigmatic Man in the Planet sitting in his cramped little room, I was hooked. This wasn't a movie- this was an experience. I hadn't been this absorbed by any film since before middle school. When the credits flashed by to Fats Waller's gleeful music, I was shaken- in all the best possible ways.You have to keep in mind that ERASERHEAD is a film aimed at the soul, not at the brain. Yes, not everything will be explained when the credits roll. In fact, most of the imagery isn't explained at all.The story itself is deceptively simple, and not as inaccessible as most reviewers describe. Henry Spencer is an depressed man living in a world of abandoned factories, railyards, and mounds of dirt. His one-room apartment is a Lower East Side tenement from Hell. One evening his temptress neighbor tells him that his ex-girlfriend and her parents have invited him to dinner. This dinner turns out to be perversely awkward (like MEET THE PARENTS on acid), and it so happens that his ex has given birth to... something (imagine the offspring between a raptor from JURASSIC PARK and a human, except in fetal form). Henry is forced to marry his ex, and they live together in his apartment with the baby. Revealing any more would take away from the fun.The cinematography is amazingly beautiful. It seems Lynch and crew have discovered at least ten different variations of black, making film-noir look like THE WIZARD OF OZ. The rumbling, everpresent soundtrack frequently shifts from sensually overwhelming to breathtaking. When the Lady in the Radiator (Henry's muse) sings In heaven, everything is fine, you are both repulsed by her deformed face and enchanted by one of the most eerie songs in the cinematic universe.It took a grand total of six years from getting financing to putting ERASERHEAD into theaters, and it all seems to have paid off. 1977 is best remembered for giving the world STAR WARS, the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood auteur era. But while studio execs were envisioning the profits of mass-marketed franchises, David Lynch was watching audiences vomit and literally run out of the theater (including the projectionist) at the premier of his first film.Not because it was God-awful, but because it gets into people's heads the way very few other films can.

What sets it apart from other films is that much of the film is shown in cryptic metaphors that take a great deal of thought to decipher. This isn't helped by the fact that what's real and what's not tend to blend together seamlessly. If you're anything like me, you will be absolutely baffled your first viewing.While the strange way the story is presented is enough to merit a viewing, it is clear that David Lynch is a master at creating powerful visuals. One scene that particularly struck me is where Mary comes out of the kitchen, sobbing, and can be seen behind her eerie, grinning father. While some of the scenes end being downright absurd, when Lynch gets it right, he gets it right.The soundtrack is another piece of interest. It's strange, fairly ambient, and fits the film perfectly. In Heaven is one of the most chilling uses of a song ever. Really an excellent score.Jack Nance does a superb job at the nervous, awkward Henry, but other than that, the acting is nothing spectacular.Now, this movie does do some things wrong. While it may come down to personal preference, I found the pacing to be excruciatingly slow. I honestly think that this hurt the film more than anything else. It became tedious and painful to watch at some points, because things go so slowly. Of course, the fact that I didn't get what was going on certainly didn't help, but the pace is still nearly unbearable.As I've said before, some of the scenes simply don't work. The grandmother, head, and chicken ones in particular come off more comedic than disturbing. It's understandable with a film like this, but it's a point worth mentioning.All in all, Eraserhead is an interesting, if flawed, film that is worth at least one viewing. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Perhaps the darkest most depressing piece of cinema ever made. ***** out of 5","Date":"4 March 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" This is a dark dark movie that revels in it's unpleasantries.

It isn't quite like Mulholand Dr. where entire scenes are placed out of order. There is also an element of humor, the blackest kind. There were times where I laughed my head off even though feeling kind of guilty about it. There is constantly some kind of sound playing in the background. A lot of the time these sounds are exaggerated, such as the puppies sucking on their mother's teats. That particular sound drove me crazy, but I was laughing all the same. There is a baby fetus thing that was born prematurely and it does nothing but cry... and at times, maybe even laugh. We have a lady that looks like she was taken straight of the 1930's, but she has great big monstrously deformed cheeks that look like they may be cancer. She sings a song and dances. She is disturbing. It's a great film to come up with your own conclusions and answers for it's bizarre scenes. The overall film is 'depression' on film. It's a nightmare. Not pleasant.

Even though there is minimal dialogue and minimal violence, it tends to scare.  The reason I think it scared me is because it was so realistic.  Think about it.  You're thrown into a life changing situation that will change it for the worst.  You have a wife you don't love and a child that will never be normal.  So you start to escape into your own place (i.e. the Radiator) where you are happy.  You start to cling to this dream world because it is the only thing left that makes you happy.  You come out of the dream world and try for a second chance at happiness on the outside of that special place, but again you are let down.  So you destroy the thing that caused it all because you think its the only way out.  When that thing is destroyed (i.e. the Baby) you find that nothing has been fixed and your world falls apart.  Think of it on that level and just try to get a good nights sleep after watching.  You'll see what I mean.On a lighter note, the song that the Lady in the Radiator sings can be interpreted in a positive way, despite the ominous tone of the song.  In heaven everything is fine to me, means that no matter how bad things get, you can always escape into your own mind, which Henry does for a little while.  Anyway, I thought this movie was scary.  Its symbolisim plays a big part in that.  It can be interpreted in many ways, but that is just my interpretation.  Go and watch it.

If you're trying to appeal to the in-crowd or art-house hipster wannabes, then be my guest, waste your time (and/or money) but trust me even if you dabble in eccentric cinema you'll want to gouge your eyes out after watching this. But as they say, one man's trash is another's treasure. If you want something convoluted and a bit different try Kubrick, Cronenberg, Mike, Aronofsky or maybe a superior Lynch film such as Lost Highway or Muholland Drive.

I don't care what anyone else tells you otherwise, the reason movies exist is to tell stories in a visual form. The stories themselves can be about whatever the filmmakers want them to be about, but it should at least tell some kind of story.Okay, so before I start sounding like a broken record, I'll just cut to the chase - Eraserhead was a colossal failure as a movie. Yellow Submarine made more sense, and I've never been high in my life. Fewer things actually happened in this movie than a typical episode of Dragon Ball Z. The plot (if there was one) was so wrapped up in multi-layered metaphors as to become completely irrelevant. If you want to use metaphors and symbolism in a movie, that's one thing. In fact, one of my favorite uses of symbolism in a movie comes from another David Lynch film (Blue Velvet). But in that instance, the metaphor was perfectly clear to anyone who had been paying attention to the movie. Here, the metaphors lose any meaning Lynch may have had by becoming so convoluted that nobody, not even the man who made the movie, can glean any sort of meaning from them.To summarize, I disliked this movie for the same reasons I dislike abstract art (which I do not consider to be art, as it requires no actual talent to produce) and poetry it manages to find the most confusing way possible to say absolutely nothing.

However, I found this movie to be a very enlightening lesson. That lesson being How not to make an enjoyable movie. Some of you might say that this is a form of art, but to the average man, this movie was about as entertaining as a root canal. I warn you, if you are looking for an enjoyable experience, please avoid this movie, because this film was designed to carry out Lynch's deepest desire to confuse the hell out of people and get paid while doing it. I don't believe that there are any deeper meanings behind any parts of this movie and that Lynch is secretly sitting in his house laughing at all the schmucks out there willing to waste their time to debate it. But if you are an elitist yearning to be accepted in a pretentious group, well perhaps this is the film for you. Have fun making films like this without 1/100th of the popularity of Lynch (how he ever became known or funded is still a mystery to me).

The story is drowned in overbearing symbolism and excessive comments which are either lost entirely to the viewer, or saturate him or her with their obviousness.

There is virtually no dialogue, much less meaningful dialogue. Since it has no plot, the action is excruciatingly painfully slow developing to whatever extent one would considered that it developed at all. The end befits the rest of this abortion, it just truncates in mid-frame. Oh, and I was not ever fooled into thinking the damn thing was ever going anywhere, one reaches that conclusion within 60 seconds of the start. But you have time invested, it's a crappy weather Saturday afternoon, so what the hell. The one thing I concluded very early on from this waste of an hour and a half was that the director was attempting to play a prank on his audience, mocking anyone gullible enough to pay money to see this masterpiece.

What we have here is a pile of drunk and drugged art students who found an old camera behind a dumpster and decided to make a film before they passed out. Want to see little girls hiding inside radiators with their mouths filled with golf balls? Want to see her dance? Want to see a little odd chap with funny hair stand in the dark, in the same place without moving for 10 minutes while the camera zooms in and out of his face? This wouldn't be so bad except his expression stays the same- he looks like he has soiled himself and doesn't want Mr Lynch to know. But Mr Lynch does know, and there is a game of wits to see who breaks first.The madness continues- the man who may or may not be married to one, none, or two women is disturbed to learn that he is a father. Of course, these being drunk and drugged hippy art students- the baby is a fish! And not even something pretty like a Salmon, no, this looks like it has been swimming in a toilet all its life. The girl dances in the radiator for a while, the man soils himself again, and the film ends. What was the point? I'm sure the director was making some sort of extraordinarily intelligent and important point about War or George Bush or something, but all I got from it was a sick feeling. I had to skip through all the moments where nothing happens (most of the film) wishing that the man would go crazy and shoot someone, or at least the fish would turn evil and try to eat someone. I like films where lots of things happen, explosions and fights and fast stuff. Nothing of the sort happens here.This is like picking up a comic only to find that all the pages are black and white, with no pictures or words or X-Men. Luckily no-one has ever heard of this movie. Maybe I'll give it to that fool Brendan who lives on my street and he can watch it and self combust. Knowing him though, he'll probably love it. Fool. This film is not right. It is the product of a disturbed mind. It's like reaching into your wallet and rather than extracting 5 bucks, you pull out 2 burnt sausages.

His physical appearance takes you, the viewer, into his own domain and his own odyssey.If the characters were'nt bothering enough, there's also the mysterious, supernatural figures.But my most favorite thing about ERASERHEAD are the sound effects. They are the BEST I've ever experienced in a film, striking and very haunting. Almost as if the air and the building are alive, waiting to swallow Henry up.

I try to find some sort of redeeming value for the time I invested, even if it's just to laugh at the badness.This film however takes the cake. I want my 88 minutes back. I want to kick David Lynch's behind. The only power this movie had for me was the power to sicken and irritate.Art films are fine. There are many out there. The Seventh Sign by Ingmar Bergman for example. Watch those not this. I've always prided myself on attempting to be cultured enough to watch even the most tedious of art films and find something redeeming or artistic.OK, OK, I'm ranting. This film is THAT bad. It's made far worse by the vast amount of praise it gets when, in my opinion, it's a sophomoric attempt at surrealistic grandeur.Lynch has serious problems. I might have been willing to give the movie a 2 or a 3 for at least attempting to be artsy but then I watched the extras and was subjected to him stuttering on (even more time he owes me) in disjointed paroxysms about how awesome the drawer of pudding and peas was, etc. *sigh* Many reviewers here have already said things like this and I want to back them up! The Art Institute that gave him the grant should have been shut down (and possibly brought up on charges for damage to the psyche of viewers). This film really is, as one person here put it, like The Emporers New Clothes. All right, alright, I'll calm down and try to give a more direct synopsis **SPOILER ALERT MILD SPOILERS AHEAD** The film is set in a dreamy sepia-toned gritty world of industrial decay. The characters seem to follow no known pattern of behavior, the monsters are very, VERY poorly animated (in the opening sequence you can actually see the strings...maybe THAT was supposed to be artsy too?), the FX are simplistic, and even the dialogue is secondary to the parade of lighting and attempted artsy camera-work that fails abysmally by being both unnecessary, overwrought and FAR TOO TEDIOUS.While it's obvious, especially after listening to Lynch's monologue, that there ARE some themes going here, parental fear, fatherhood and the nascent horror of being, the actual delivery of the film is so languid and...words just don't exist to describe it...overwrought, overreaching, etc. are the best I can do...that the film made me almost catatonic while watching it.I will concede that there are many people who might enjoy this, especially those who enjoy disjointed and/or viscerally disgusting images.OK, I take one thing back there IS one redeeming thing about the film that being the sounds. In their ability to raise one's hackles they succeed (and I have to think that was part of what Lynch was trying to do). The ongoing, seemingly incessant strange thumpings and undertones of distant factory noises, is like Chinese water torture. If that's what he was trying to accomplish then the film succeeded in that one way. Not something to be proud of or praised for. I could as easily listen to fingernails on a chalkboard for 88 minutes and get as much artistic value out of it. To say nothing of entertainment.Movies are made to entertain, that is their function and reason for being. This film does not entertain, it sickens, repulses and BORES. I cannot recommend enough avoiding this sepia-toned waste of celluloid.P.S. I apologize for the rant but it's just THAT BAD and I feel it my civic duty to warn viewers.P.P.S.

Sure, there is a lot of obvious sexual imagery, but what it all means seems pretty pointless and I truly think this is THE point of the film.In addition to having no point, the film also tries very hard to make an impression by pushing the audience's gross-out buttons! In other words, keep playing various horrific images in an apparent attempt to make people flinch or be repelled. Frankly, I've seen worse but would probably have to go back to a medical museum to find it again! It also tries to push the limits by making the film very unpleasant--not just appalling but also by making the whole thing rather boring and drab.So, you are left with a confusing film with probably no meaning, bizarre sexual imagery, gross special effects and complete utter boredom all wrapped up in one package.
