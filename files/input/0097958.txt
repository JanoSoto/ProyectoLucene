Part of that ritual is National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, about which I have nothing but good things to say. This should be part of your Holiday season too, because despite it not seeming like it all the way through, the film as a whole is just so thoroughly festive, cheery and good-hearted.It opens with a great set-piece, Clark taking his family out in the front-wheel drive sleigh to dig their Christmas tree out of the snow-covered ground. He's a desperate loser, but you have to love the guy, working his butt off to give his extended family the perfect Christmas. (That's the difference in this Vacation movie, by the way - the Griswolds don't go anywhere, their folks come to them).So the shenanigans finding a tree set the pattern for a season of chaos, fighting in-laws, squirrels, stupid relatives, huge dogs, snooty neighbours and collapsing turkeys. And as if that wasn't stress enough for poor Clark, he's waiting for his Christmas bonus to come through to cover a cheque he's already written.The script brims with festive jollity, enthusing the audience with Clark's excitement for the holidays. Stand out moments include the welcome (and hilarious) return of Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, the uber-hick sponger with a trailer-full of weirdo kids and rubber sheets, and Mae Questel's appearance as Aunt Bethany. She used to voice Betty Boo, and plays the crazy old woman to perfection.See this movie. Get it on video. I normally watch it the first time on a miserable October Sunday, when I start to think properly about Christmas. Nothing can replace this movie as the one thing guaranteed to get me looking forward to late December. Fabulous stuff, and as festive for me as tinsel and carols. Cuddle up with this one.

First time around he went across America in a metallic pea Station Wagon and it ended in disaster. Then they went across Europe and met similar, albeit much less funny, results.For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Griswolds, Clark is food additives expert who works for a company that doesn't appreciate him. He sets high standards for holiday events that no one can live up to and is notorious for dragging his grudging family along on every painstaking detail of every scheme. His wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is the voice of reason, who keeps the family rooted in reality and responds with frequent deadpan bewilderment to his constant disasters. The long-suffering kids, Russ and Audrey (Johnny Galecki and a very young Juliette Lewis) have turned into the living embodiment of pure cynicism, but there's no talking any sense into Clark Griswold. Ever! But now Clark just wants to stay at home in the snowy Chicago suburbs for a 'fun, old-fashioned, family Christmas' and he's going to let nothing stop him. His enthusiasm for the holidays manages to infect the audience and you'll be rooting for him the whole way. He's an anti-Scrooge and if you're having a Christmas crisis then you need to watch this movie. Any disasters can be overcome.But that's easier said than done. He didn't bargain on bickering family members (including the voice of Betty Boop, Mae Questel, as a senile old aunt), a house covered in non-working Christmas lights, a seriously over-cooked turkey, snotty Yuppie neighbors making fun of him or Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his hickabilly family turning up unannounced to sponge some Christmas cheer off him.What stops it from being just another generic Christmas movie is a brilliant script by John Hughes packed full of hilarious set-pieces and perfect comic timing from Chevy Chase. He's a great actor but his appeal sadly declined in the 90s when he refused to evolve into more serious roles like Bill Murray did. Clark Griswold and Fletch are probably his most famous roles and this Vacation is definitely one you need to take.It's hard to pick the best moments but Randy Quaid's sudden appearance will make you grin a mile wide, a cat wrapped up in a box (with Happy Birthday paper!) that meets an unfortunate end and 'an asshole in his bathrobe emptying a chemical toilet into the sewer' are just plain brilliant. But what gives Christmas Vacation something more that makes it so much more special that all the other Christmas movies is that wonderful theme song! It's absolutely brilliant! But that ain't the only great tune the film as to offer. There are also some classic songs by Ray Charles, Bing Crosby and Gene Autry.Although not the best of the bunch (Harold Ramis' direction had an evil edge to the first film that made it just that little bit better), this film has become a Yuletide classic and must be watched every year. Since Christmas is full of annual traditions this film is definitely one you should add to the list. It would criminal to give it anything less that the highly coveted 10/10.

Chechik and written by John Hughes.  Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has decided to have a traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas, and has invited his parents and in-laws to stay with them through the season.  He has a surprise he wants to share with everyone this year; with his Christmas bonus from work, he's putting in a pool, to which he's already committed the down-payment money (so the bonus had better come through, big time, or he's `in it up to here').  To kick off the season, he takes Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and the kids, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to the mountains to find the perfect `Griswold family Christmas tree.  And it's only the first of one hilarious scene after another, as we follow Clark and clan through one long laugh-fest, filled with surprises and fun. 	Chase is at his best here, in the most enduring (and endearing) character he's ever done; Clark the Everyman, who only wants the best things for his family and himself, but whose plans more often than not go awry, doomed to fall just short of realization.  When he decorates the outside of the house, he uses 25,000 twinkle lights; they use enough juice to black-out an entire neighborhood, and they do (once he can get them to work).  Then when cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) show up unexpectedly in the `RV' they now call home, Eddie asks Clark if he's surprised to see him.  Surprised?  Eddie is the last person on earth Clark expected, or wanted, to see.  `Eddie,' he tells him, `I couldn't be more surprised if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet.'  Another memorable scene involves a wild squirrel who came in with the Christmas tree and proceeds to make his appearance during dinner, only to provoke a wild romp upstairs and down as they all pursue (and in some cases try to elude) the deadly invader. 	A terrific cast was assembled for this movie, but Quaid is the stand-out, and he perfects the Eddie character in this one; forever the lamebrain with the big heart, and the one who takes the situation in hand when Clark's bonus turns out to be an enrollment in a jelly-of-the-month club.  Clark's parents are played by Diane Ladd (Nora) and John Randolph (Clark, Sr.), and Ellen's by Doris Roberts (Frances) and E.G. Marshall (Art).  Other notable performances are turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo) and Nicholas Guest (Todd), as Clark's yuppie next door neighbors, and also by William Hickey (Uncle Lewis) and Mae Questel (Aunt Bethany).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Nicolette Scorsese (Mary), Cody Burger (Rocky), Ellen Hamilton Latzen (Ruby Sue) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley).  `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is timeless comedy, a must for every video collection.  It can be watched over and over again, and the humor stays fresh while the laughs get even bigger.  There's a little bit of every family in here, and this movie may be just the tonic you'll need some day to get you through your own `special' holiday season.  I rate this one 10/10.

Here's mine then. Most of the National Lampoon films are pretty awful, even my American friends agree on that. Vacation was good, but European Vacation, Vegas Vacation and a long list of others are best avoided. However, in amongst all the dross there are two absolute classics Animal House & Christmas Vacation. I LOVE this movie and it's been a part of my family's Christmas every year since 1990. I'm delighted that British TV will be showing it again in 2 days from now, December 25th. Why is it so good? Because unlike almost every other comedy it's hilarious ALL the way through. There's no let-up, no weak sections and no scene that doesn't work. From Chevy Chase driving his car under a 40 ton truck right at the beginning, to the SWAT team crashing into his living room right at the end, you'll be laughing the whole way through. We all know what a nightmare Christmas can be and this film takes the idea, wonderfully, to the ultimate. Clark Grizwald tries to give his family the perfect Christmas, way beyond anything that could possibly happen in real life, and it's - literally - a disaster from start to finish. I'm sure every husband & father in the western world will identify with Grizwald and see something of ourselves in his antics? The supporting cast are all excellent, particularly Randy Quaid as the freeloading hillbilly Cousin Eddy. I recently discovered Chevy Chase's greedy boss is played by Bill Murray's brother. yeah, I can see the similarity now. There are SO many priceless scenes in this movie it's hard to pick out the best, but if you like the thought of exploding Christmas trees, electrocuted pussy-cats, wrecking your neighbours' house and kidnapping your boss (gift-wrapped) then you'll love Christmas Vacation. I give this movie 9 out of 10 and hope everyone who hasn't seen it yet will take the opportunity, and treasure it as much as I do.

The reason being is that everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another. Who hasn't had their crazy family over during the holiday season? Well, that's Christmas Vacation, one of the funniest movies you will ever see. You think that Vacation topped it off with the laughs, believe me when I say that you've seen nothing yet. With an all star cast that clicked so well, you couldn't go wrong going on a great Christmas Vacation with the Griswolds.Clark Griswold has really got the Christmas spirit this year, and his wife Ellen, son Rusty, and daughter Audrey have noticed that. Clark has invited Ellen's parents Art and Francis Smith, his own parents Clark and Nora Griswold, and his Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis to spend the holidays at the Griswold house in Chicago. But in spite of all the good intentions and careful planning, Christmas plans start to go awry crazy squirrels, SWAT teams, burning Christmas trees, an over cooked turkey and of course a visit from the world's favorite white trash with a heart of gold Cousin Eddie! A Christmas ride not to be missed with the Griswold family.One of the things I just adore about this movie is the little touches they put in the film the grandparents falling asleep to an old Christmas movie playing on TV, the anxiety you feel as the doorbell rings knowing who's going to be behind it, and the little awkwardness during dinner when you hear everyone chewing their food. Chevy Chase is still such a pervert of course going for the hot sales lady instead of Cristy Brinkley this time, but you can't help but love and laugh at his fantasy in the back yard while the whole family is swimming in his most wanted work bonus a family sized pool. He maybe a crazy pervert at times, but you feel the love he has for his family and how badly he wants Christmas to be perfect.There are some great laughs in this movie a squirrel gets caught in the Christmas tree that Clark brings in and it attacks the family and neighbors! Clark gets upset that there is no Christmas bonus so his cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss, wraps him in a bow and gives him to Clark so he could kick him in the butt! A cat chews on the Christmas lights and gets electrocuted under the chair. But if you also get past all the slap stick humor, you still feel the Christmas message at the end, that despite all the craziness that comes around Christmas, don't forget what it's really about peace and love. A wonderful ending and a perfect movie for Christmas that I watch every year, Christmas Vacation is definitely in Santa's movie collection somewhere.10/10 "},{"Title":"I really can't imagine a better and funnier Christmas movie","Date":"22 February 2014","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I think it's not necessary to write too much about this film.It's simply a masterpiece.In my opinion only Billy Wilder possibly-POSSIBLY-could have made an even better Christmas movie.For me that says a lot.This is my second review.The first one was about Rambo II It's difficult to imagine something more contrasting than these two movies.Whereas Rambo II represents (and shows) the bad,evil and disgusting things on earth,Christmas Vacation represents (and shows) the good,pleasant and beautiful ones.For example the incredibly beautiful woman in the store.Chevy Chase's reaction is so funny!!

By the way,Griswold's yuppie neighbors also don't make a very pleasant impression- because (not although) they are played so well.For me-and obviously for many others too-Christmas without Christmas Vacation cannot be a real Christmas.I would like to watch it more often than once a year,but I have the-unjustified,many may say-fear of liking this masterpiece somewhat less if I watch it too often.

It's that time of year again! You can't celebrate Christmas without watching National Lampoon Christmas Vacation, first! Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. It is the third installment in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, and was written by John Hughes, based on his short story in National Lampoon magazine, Christmas '59. This movie is notable for being the only one of the Vacation series to take place at the Griswold home which gives the vacation concept, something new. Some people think as this movie as a reboot than a sequel. The film tells the story of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) whom is trying to create the best Christmas for his family, but everything, he wants to happen, go against his favor. Can Clark Griswold make the best Christmas holiday for his family or will it turn out to be another disaster? Watch it, to find out. Without spoiling the film, too much. The movie is a great watch. Most of the humors hit the funny bone than miss to me. I love the animated opening credits with the Christmas vacation theme. Apparently even Santa Claus isn't immune to the comic misfortune. I love the slapstick humor has for Clark. Clark trying to set up Christmas lightings is probably the highlight of the film. The movie was very smart in its recycle on old jokes like the Easter eggs, Wally World Cups. Still, other old clichés felt a little overused by other films at the time such as the dog humping scene. Even, Mele Kalikimaka pool sequence was kinda overused. It remind me, of the pool sequence from 1982's Fast Time at Ridgemont High. It wasn't really funny. The fan service, Mary's (Nicolette Scorsese) scenes are hot, but it could be taken out, in my opinion as it has nothing to bring to the table. She's no Christie Brinkley. Some people might not like the dark crude raunchy humor, the movie brings. After all, it does have a cat getting killed on screen and an elderly man getting catch on fire. This movie might not be for everybody. If you got small children, this movie might not be for them with all the sex, violence and harsh language themes. A parent should judge for themselves, if this movie is alright for their children. For the most part, it felt like a PG-13. The movie is well acted. The original cast is just as good as they were in the original previous movie. Chevy Chase is awesome as the everyman father, who just wanted to give the best Christmas ever to his family, but has to fight so much to do it. In my opinion, this is Chevy Chase's greatest film. Supporting characters like Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), were alright for the most part, despite her, being the submissive of sorts, type of wife. The children, Aubrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) were kinda forgettable as they are given little to no screen time. It's seem like in every Vacation movie, new actors are always playing the Griswold's children. It can be a bit confusing as Rusty and Audrey's age differ from film to film. In this film, Audrey tends to be older, despite Rusty being older in the previous two films. Anyways, the previous Griswold's children actors really didn't do much, after their film. At less, these actors went on to become bigger names in the industry. One of the most entertaining part of the film, had to come with Randy Quaid's character of Cousin Eddie who comes back from the original film to plays the opposite of Chevy Chase's straight man character as the scene-stealing slob. He wasn't too annoying or unlikeable. Quaid did the right amount of balance. Other people worth noting is Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the yippie neighbor, Margo Chester, whom always get accident abuse from the Griswold. She was funny. The movie has way too much elder characters to remember. Those could be cut down, or written better. The only ones, I can remember are Francis (Doris Roberts), Bethany (Mae Questel), Lewis (William Hickey) and Art (E.G. Marshall). All of them add their own bits of amusement. Overall Having seen the previous two films in the Lampoon series. 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation & 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation. I was delighted, this film was really enjoyable. In my opinion, it's the best comedy in the National Lampoon series as a whole. It was not a disappointment, like the sequel, 2003's Christmas Vacation 2 Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure & 1997's National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation. Since its release in 1989, Christmas Vacation has often been labeled as a modern Christmas classic. This film should definitely raise your spirits and give thanks that your Christmas isn't as stressful as the Griswold.

Christmas Vacation, released in 1989, was brilliantly written by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. This laugh out loud comedy promises to have everyone entertained throughout its 97 minute runtime with performers such as Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid. Christmas Vacation is bound to entertain the whole family through its many big name performers, its surprise plot twists, and its relatability to many families. Christmas Vacation is filled with many surprises beginning to end. Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold) and Bevery D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold) want to get the whole extended family over for one big Griswold family Christmas. A family dinner is planned with a highly anticipated summer surprise announcement for the Griswold family. Little do the Griswolds know though, the Christmas weekend will be a lot more work than they originally thought. The Griswold family Christmas is filled with frozen eyes, burning trees, a surprise visit from Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), a police raid, and much much more. Can the Griswolds overcome their holiday troubles and salvage a pleasant family get-together? Christmas Vacation makes a very good connection to the viewing audience because many people can relate to the Griswold Family. This movie is a classic example of how family get-togethers, especially around the holiday season, cannot be all they are cracked up to be. Even though the Griswolds have a lot of hardships in the movie, they show how family can come together to make the best of poor decisions. Clark and Ellen Griswold make one of the most relatable husband and wife duos in the film industry. Bickering goes on between Clark and Ellen throughout the movie due to their lack of wise decisions/ ideas. However, they always end up supporting each other in the end no matter the outcome. Randy Quaid serves as the perfect example of that one annoying family member that everyone has. Pretty much everything he does in the movie ends up being a giant failure. Even though Quaid's character is not the sharpest tool in the shed though, he definitely wins the award for having the biggest heart. The director did an excellent job at making this movie relatable to all viewers through the various personalities each character possesses and through the many events that occur throughout the Griswold family Christmas.If you are looking for a good movie to watch with the entire family this holiday season, look no further than National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. The cast and director have come together to make a perfect movie that relates to everyone who ever has had or attempted to have a family holiday party. This film will make you laugh and say wow, our family is kind of like the Griswolds!

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold accompanied by new actors as their children, Rusty (Johnny Galecki) and Audrey (Juliette Lewis).The movie begins with Clark and family going to a Christmas tree forest and ends up with Clark drag racing a beat up truck and ending up wedged under a semi. When the family finally decides on the perfect tree, they realize they have forgotten the chainsaw. The tree they choose is way longer than their car and still attached to its roots.The movie gets funnier when Cousin Eddie and family show up in a beat up RV expecting to spend Christmas with Clark. Eddie decides to empty his RV waste into the neighborhood drainpipe which leads to several explosions throughout the movie.The sledding scene with Chevy Chase is the most memorable in the movie. Clark oils his sled and takes a wild ride through the roads and forest to end up in a Wal-Mart parking lot unhurt.Chevy Chase carries the film with his comical delivery. His facial expressions and crazed actions keep the audience entertained. Mae Questal as senile Aunt Bethany keeps the audience laughing with her confused actions and comments.

Along the way, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) encounters a few situations that hilariously go wrong. The comedy is inventively funny, as it takes some of the recurring jokes in the Vacation movies and refreshes them for the holiday theme. The acting talent is brilliant. Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, and Miriam Flynn all reprise their roles from the previous Vacation movies, Cape Fear's Juliette Lewis and The Big Bang Theory's Johnny Galecki step into the roles of Audrey and Rusty this time around, and there are supporting performances from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Brian Doyle-Murray, Doris Roberts, and Mae Questel. Each performer does great in their roles, especially Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, who steals most of the scenes. And the writing is incredible, as it balances out the comedy with moments of Clark trying to realize the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas Vacation is one of 5 sequels in the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise, and it's easily the best one. It may not eclipse the first Vacation movie, but with its holiday theme, it stands on its own. It's a timeless classic that continues to hold up today, and it has managed to stand as one of the best Christmas movies, as well as one of the funniest movies of all-time.Score 99/100Recommendation The highest of recommendations "},{"Title":"Very funny Christmas movie","Date":"18 November 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is a good Christmas movie for the family.

Come Thanksgiving each year, I start checking my DVD list and begin playing my favorite holiday flicks. I like to save Christmas Vacation until close to Christmas. After my children and their families have finished most of the hectic shopping for Christmas, this is a good film to sit down to for some laughs. This is an adult film &#x96; in much of the humor and some of the language and actions. We will show it to kids when they reach their teens, with explanations and reminders about foul language or disrespectful parts. There is a genius in the writing of this film that combines occasional witty dialog with side talking built around slapstick and other situations. The situations and characters are sources of many laughs. It's all built around Clark Griswold, played to perfection by Chevy Chase. This is one of those rare original films that makes a hit and lasts so long that no one would think to try to do a remake. Indeed, who could equal or top the humor of this story as given us by this great cast? I can't imagine Clark Griswold as anyone other than Chevy Chase. Or Eddie played by anyone other than Randy Quaid. Or even the yuppie neighbors, Todd and Margo as played by Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis- Dreyfus, respectively. All the cast contribute to the humor, but it all revolves around Clark Griswold. This is a wonderful laugh-out-loud comedy that never seems to wear out. Of course it might if one were to play it incessantly during the year, instead of holding it for the holidays.

A large portion of viewers that would have seen the original Vacation film may not relate so much to Christmas Vacation simply because there's a difference of six years. Christmas Vacation stands out the most in the series for two reasons, it's Christmas and it was the era of John Hughes films that had consecutive box office hits every year, from 1986 to 1993. It gets played on TV over the holidays about eight times on a number of the major networks and more than often watched by families, even though the film in its entirety is not completely family friendly. John Hughes knew that sometimes you have to throw a wrench in some of the family-oriented pieces. That was the perfect era to do that kind of writing, and get away with it.

I was also familiar with and loved this third Christmas-themed movie. Here we have the Griswolds again, minus the road trip and the catchy Holiday Road theme song.Now, looking back at these movies, I can say Vacation is definitely better than Christmas Vacation. Vacation has some smarter humour and some of Christmas Vacation's jokes are recycled from the original- the car flying, Clark going on a cursing streak, the family kidnapping someone. (Last time it was John Candy, now it's Brian Doyle Murray. Ellen says it's her family's first kidnapping, which is a blatant lie.)Although the sequel borrows too much from Vacation at times, at other times I wish it had taken after it more. Rusty and Audrey look little like they did before. Audrey is too skinny and too blonde; Rusty is too short and wide, and he looks about ten. Jane Krakowski is absent, despite her classic appearance in the original as Vicki (Vicki does come back in the mostly unfunny Vegas Vacation, but with a new actress). Also missing- the nudity. Both Vacation and European Vacation had breasts.That said, there's some good material here. The jokes which make this movie worth seeing include a comically poorly chosen tree, a sign of Clark's foolish nature. The wrapped up cat is funny, and its demise is the only time an animal death in these movies was actually funny. (I've never owned a cat, and as a kid I loved the expression fried pussy cat.) The botched grace at dinner is funny. Clark flipping out with a chainsaw and his staircase is funny.

This time, the Griswolds decide to stay home and enjoy the holiday, rather than take a road trip. Clark's goal is to have what he calls an old-fashioned family Christmas, and as a result, his parents and Ellen's parents show up to spend Christmas at the Griswold house. Eventually, the house is filled with more family members, with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, who delivers a good performance) and his brood showing up unexpectedly, and Clark's Uncle Louis and Mae Questel (the voice of Betty Boop), showing up on Christmas Eve.The family assembling is just one aspect of Clark's Christmas dream. He is a big fan of holiday decorating, so naturally the house's exterior is covered in Christmas lights, and the eventual lighting of the house leads to some hilarious moments.Clark also has a surprise gift for his family he plans to put in a swimming pool. To do that, he is relying on his Christmas bonus, and this becomes a sub-storyline for much of the film. It all adds up to moments that make you laugh.Christmas Vacation is the funniest of the four Vacation pictures. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are good as Clark and Ellen. Questel is fun as the confused Aunt Bethany, as is William Hickey as the grouchy Uncle Louis. And Brian Doyle-Murray deserves praise as Clark's boss, who is a real snob.As I said before, if you have seen the other Vacation movies, you know what to expect.

They fill us with warmth and joy and put smiles on our faces. Then there are Christmas movies that make us laugh. The first two National Lampoon's 'Vacation' films were a success and so it was only a matter of time before The Griswolds would grace the big screen again in another vacation from hell. But this time instead of traveling they would stay at home to celebrate the Holidays with their relatives. Sounds innocent enough right? Well if you saw the previous films then you know what's to come. Truly one of the funniest comedies and best movies to watch at Christmas.Pros Great work by the ensemble cast. Plenty hilarious situations and lines. Some good tender moments. As usual a great script by the late John Hughes. Quick paced. Beautiful winter landscape. Festive soundtrack, which includes a really memorable title theme. Fun animated opening titles sequence.Cons Not much of it does, but some of the humor really misses.Final thoughts The makers of this movie really topped the previous ones and gave us what is without a doubt the best in the series.

Clark Griswold(Chase) brings his family out to no-where to pick a Christmas tree and almost gets into a car accident in the process. Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) says her parents are coming this year too and she is worried how everyone is going to get along and fit in the house and Clark reassures her and says it will be fine. Clark starts talking to an attractive girl at the lingerie area and find himself getting a little to out of hand when his son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) comes up to him. Both parents have arrived of theirs and nothing but mayhem, causing arguments between each parent. Clark finally gets the lights going on the house and Uncle Eddie (Randy Quaid) shows up with his family and it's now a packed Christmas that he wasn't expecting to have.This movie will remind you of a lot of different things, weather it's another movie, your own Christmas, or just fun times of the Christmas holiday with the family. Some parts just remind me of dumb and dumber or some of the dumb things they would do throughout that movie. Chase reminds me so much of Jim Carrey in his wacky comedies that you just absolutely laugh about throughout the whole movie. Chase is now older and in a TV show called Community which I haven't got a chance to see yet, but it looks funny. Juliette Andrews who played Audrey Griswold is currently in the movie coming out soon Whip It and Metropia. Johnny Galecki who played Rusty Griswold is currently in the show The Big Bang Theory which I believe is on Monday or Wednesdays. For some it is fun to see what they are up to now and most of the others from the movie Christmas Vacation are hardly acting anymore. This is also one Chevy Chase movie that will soon become one of your favorite classic movies to watch with your family.

The kids and mom don't amount to much anyway, merely witnessing Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase at the tail-end of his comedic peak) and his clumsy misadventures as the host of an overcrowded holiday home including both sets of in-laws.The only real input for family's sake is Randy Quaid's white trash Cousin Eddie. A scene- stealer in the first film given his own fifteen minute layover, Eddie becomes Clark's partner- in-crime. But Quaid seems to be doing an exaggerated imitation, turning Eddie into an over- the-top comic book character. Meanwhile, Clark's reactionary disdain for his cousin-in-law's gross personality becomes redundant after the first ten times.Most of the film's spoken jokes are limp and somewhat forced. The funniest moments rely on physical gags the fate of a curious cat; an enraged squirrel; and Christmas house lights that refuse to work.The direction, including hand-held camera and intentionally awkward moments, flows pretty well with the John Hughes script that, as usual, mixes semi dark comedy with pathos and hijinx. While the soundtrack can be spooky and ominous, befitting what's going on in Clark's troubled mind, successfully contrasting with the old fashion Norman Rockwell house and backdrop.Touted as a Holiday classic, this is really a hit-and-miss outing. The most family oriented Lampoon venture keeps some of the blue humor hidden yet it's implied throughout.Glimpses of a brooding Clark at work in the office, hoping for a bonus check to buy a swimming pool, and the intrusion of a put-upon yuppie couple who live next door &#x96; victims of whatever Clark's doing outside &#x96; are distractions to get us out of the crowded house.

Clark W. Griswold desires a holiday Christmas at home with extended family but everything goes wrong. Chevy Chase delivers several great physical jokes including a sled race that goes beyond fast. As Clark he awaits his bonus so to surprise the family with a swimming pool. He goes beyond standard family procedure especially when lighting the house. Beverly D'Angelo returns as his loyal and sensible wife Ellen who tries to make sense of Clark's mishaps. Randy Quaid steals every scene he is in as redneck cousin Eddie who arrives in a beat up R.V, and delivers some of the best lines. One element of concern is too many characters to really advance although William Hickey as Uncle Lewis is a steal when he accidentally burns down the tree. Everyone else is a role call of great talent with a few lines and moments but little development. Not for children due to adult humour including a controversial scene involving an electrocuted cat.

Griswold, Jr. (Chevy Chase) is quite enthusiastic in anticipation of an old-fashioned family Christmas. Question is, does Clark have any idea of the multitude of disasters that await him? His vacation with his family becomes a cavalcade of slip-ups, falls, crashes, bickering, messes, fires, breakage, etc., etc., just about ANYTHING that could go wrong! Written and produced by John Hughes, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation makes a hilarious spoof of the American family get-together at Christmastime. Get ready to laugh like hell! My favorite scenes from Christmas Vacation include the following (DO NOT read any further if you have not yet seen this film). Upon realizing that he will not receive a Christmas bonus, Clark expresses a litany of harsh adjectives describing his boss (Brian Doyle Murray). After we hear a very hip rendition of Hey, Santa Claus (while the shopping malls are extremely busy with customers), Clark's speech is unintentionally peppered with sexual innuendo as he flirts with a sexy sales clerk (Nicolette Scorsese). After bringing his freshly-cut Christmas tree home, Clark cuts the rope that binds the tree branches together and CRASH! The wonderfully catchy Christmas Vacation theme song is heard during the opening credits as we see an animated cartoon of Santa Claus and his troubles at the Griswold residence. Clark's goofball cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) dumps a chemical toilet into Clark's sewer (to an accordion/tuba accompaniment of Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer). After the attic ladder whacks Clark in the face, two wooden planks cause further damage when Clark is trapped in the attic; his patient, loving wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) finally pulls open the attic door, and down tumbles Clark! Eddie tells Clark about the metal plate in his head and what happens to him when his wife Catherine (Miriam Flynn) uses the microwave; Clark then goes for an absolutely wild, outrageously funny sled ride. Clark's neighbors Todd (Nicholas Guest) and Margo (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) wonder how they're going to obtain a Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, when a tree comes crashing right through their very dining room window! All hell breaks loose when Eddie's dog chases a squirrel all through Clark's house, destroying the dining room table and a china cabinet. After Clark struggles for some time with the miles & miles of twinkling Christmas house lights, they suddenly illuminate (to the glorious accompaniment of O Come, All Ye Faithful), causing quite a bit of slapstick for neighbors Todd and Margo.Christmas Vacation is a sure-fire winner in the Christmas comedy department. With an excellent cast that includes Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid, Beverly D'Angelo, William Hickey, Mae Questel, Doris Roberts, E.G. Marshall, Johnny Galecki, Juliette Lewis, John Randolph, Diane Ladd, Brian Doyle Murray, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, this movie is a MUST for anyone wishing to laugh out loud at a Christmas family vacation disaster.

The movie misses a great opportunity to give them some personality and depth. Honestly, I couldn't tell them apart. I don't know who are who's parents. The sets of parents could fight against each other over the kids or how Clark is doing or who the family loves more. There is a world of possibilities but they are simply lumps of coal. Even the Griswold kids are not doing the sibling rivalry that well. They're the least convincing kids of the franchise. The fact that the kids are always different could be a source of self-referencing jokes. It seems like Chevy is doing all the heavy lifting to get the laughs. Everybody is playing the straight man until Randy Quaid arrives. Cousin Eddie livens up the movie a little. At least, he adds something to the movie.

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the third installment of the Vacation series as Clark Griswold and his family are spending their holiday at their home instead of taking a vacation elsewhere; instead is Clark and Ellen's family that are on a vacation as well as Clark's brother Eddie and his family. They are the ones who are having a vacation on Christmas, so now it seems that the filmmakers decide to go with a change of pace which is a good thing. The movie does have some good laughs, and it does have some great moments. Chevy Chase is always great as Clark Griswold, and the rest of the cast are great too. However, there are some parts of the film that aren't funny but it doesn't take away the experience as I am watching it. Also, on the DVD, when you watch the ending on your HDTV you can see the box where Santa Claus and the reindeers are flying in the air after Uncle Lewis drops the match into sewer as there are gas in it; that effect looks a bit dated for my taste. Anyway, the movie really does have that wonderful Christmas spirit and it really is a lot of fun to watch during the holidays.

Unfortunately, the bonus cheque Clark expects any minute is overdue - and tempers rise, but not only because of the cheque. A big event is the arrival of uninvited cousin Eddie with his family in their mobile home, as well as a little sledding afternoon with a new lubricant from Clark's company, or his shifting relationship with the very hip and clean neighbours. Cousin Eddie chooses to top off all presents with his very own special creation, only intending to deliver a real reason to be jolly......After nearly 23 years, this is one of the last 'traditional Christmas films' released, before we had a slew of self referential and ironic, Christmas movies.It's also easily the best Vacation movie, and in my opinion, Chases finest movie. It's hilarious and also one of the very few films that actually gives you a Christmas fuzzy feeling inside.Plot wise, there is no plot, it's just basically a series of sketches that build up to a family dinner, with a subplot of a bonus cheque waiting to arrive.The cast are great, and although it has a very eighties feel to it, it still feels very fresh when you watch it year after year, and it never gets boring.See it, and get that warm feeling inside every single time.A true Christmas classic.

He goes overboard, believing that he's about to receive a nice Christmas bonus. The nerve-wracking turn of events that follow are enough to create havoc when he almost suffers a nervous breakdown before a happy ending.Lots of sight gags enliven a cheerful script by John Hughes, many having to do with the lights going up all over the housetop and walls as our hero prepares to illuminate the neighborhood with lights and music. Naturally, almost every attempt fails until someone accidentally turns on the main switch.Funniest moments come after the arrival of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) who really gets into the spirit of the farce with an engaging hillbilly performance as the head of a family of rednecks. Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall add their own bits of amusement and a senile granny, played by the woman who voiced Betty Boop, offers her own brand of clownish behavior.Summing up Could have been better, but brightens the holiday mood with some shenanigans about eccentric relatives that just about anyone can relate to.Chevy Chase, as the fumbling and enthusiastic do-gooder, takes the Scrooge out of Christmas with some very entertaining, if somewhat improbable over-the-top antics and Beverly D'Angelo is charming and patient as his long-suffering wife.

So he invites his parents, his wife Ellen's parents and his uncle Lewis and aunt Bethany, who is well past senile, and later gets a surprise visit from his cousin Eddie and his family in a rusted Tenement on wheels RV.Well, the holiday goes about as haphazard as you'd might expect, pretty much not unlike a holiday any of us ever had. From Clark's gallant attempt to have a house decorated with 25,000 imported Italian twinkle lights (and nearly killing his yuppie neighbors in the process when the lights flash on and off), to exploding turkeys and burnt Christmas trees and destroyed rooms courtesy of Eddie's dog Snotz(sp?) and a squirrel, until it finally culminates in Clark receiving an envelope from his company. He expects it to be his Christmas bonus (which would pay for the swimming pool he wants to put in), instead it's a Jelly-of-the-Month-Club enrollment, which sends Clark into a hilarious, classic tirade that has to be heard to be appreciated. Basically, he wants his boss brought to his house so he can bitch him out. Naturally, Eddie obliges, bringing out the local SWAT team, who add just a little more chaos to this holiday. Eventually, Clark's boss realizes the folly of his ways, and adds 20% to what he earned that year, surely enough to get the pool and fly the whole family in for the dedication.If there was a rating higher than 10, I'd give it.

His wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is seen under the radar for most of this movie. In fact, there aren't really any subplots. The yuppie neighbors nextdoor (Nicholas Guest and Julia-Louis Dreyfuss) (Dreyfuss was the second billed!) don't really count; they're just there for comic relief. Anyway, everyone comes to the Griswold's for a hopefully fun filled time. Yeah, right.Clark's Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel, voice of Betty Boop) is a hoot. Clark, is the house on fire? No, Aunt Bethany, those are the Christmas lights. Of course, when the entire family comes, you can't really expect all of the people to be memorable (suffered last in Meet the Parents). Who is who? Well, there's a red-haired woman named Frances (Doris Roberts, TV's Everybody Loves Raymond), and a bunch of other people. Its family dynamic worked well, though, all had great chemistry. I just feel sorry that all of them had to be in the same family.Unexpected turns come up when Ellen's cousin Eddie and cousin-in-law Catherine (Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn), last seen in the first Vacation, decide to take their new RV to the Griswold's. Their hickish ways don't go over with the life in the parking lot ways of the Griswolds. Quaid is always funny, but Flynn, yet again, underplays her role.Clark is expecting a Christmas bonus from his boss, Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray). He wants/expects it so much that he bought a down payment on a pool. Of course, he doesn't have enough money right now, but once he has his bonus.... I won't spoil the surprise, but Clark doesn't get exactly what he wants.The kids Rusty and Audrey are now played by Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis, without real excitement. Before, they had had their vices and personal issues, but with so many people here, it's hard to focus on them. They also seem to have gotten younger. The movie isn't as funny as Vacation or Vegas Vacation, but it still earns high marks for taking a basic family dysfunction and making it original. Who can forget Clark's wild ride down the hill on his rocket powered sleigh? Is there anyone who can't hide the guilty pleasure laugh when Clark electrocutes a cat? Christmas Vacation could be called irresistible.It couldn't be called a Vacation movie without some unlikely but touching way of wrapping everything up. This time, Shirley provides it (who looks a lot like Walley from Vacation), and it worked on me.The whole point of a movie is to take an unbelievable situation and make you believe. Christmas Vacation did wonders, making me think that Chase was an idiot (more so!) and that so many dysfunctions could happen at once.

The hilarious moments just repeat second after second, and that's the beauty of it. This movie stuck to the Holiday spirit, it send a message, the characters were likable, the situations were enjoying, and I was so entertained by how funny this movie was. From beginning to end, Christmas Vacation kept me laughing until I crapped my pants. I bet there's nothing else I really need to say. All I said was how I enjoyed this movie so much, and it's still funny every time I watch it. This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever, and it's also my favorite Vacation movie, and it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Go check out this movie if you love Christmas, and watching Chevy Chase lose his freaking mind. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, in my review, an entertaining comedic wonderland of enjoyment and wisecracking humor.

Now you're bombarded with the all out R rated horrifying dirty comedies of nowadays. Not all of them are bad if you like that gross out comedy style. But back in the 80's, even the late 80's, adult comedy was a whole different ball game and the National Lampoon Vacation Movies pioneered many of those laughs. Christmas Vacation is definitely unique because I don't believe there were a lot of adult oriented Christmas movies out there. And no matter what anyone else says this an adult comedy. It has bad language, sexual connotations, and just general a lot of adult humour. But it works so well and this film is downright hilarious. The script is just incredibly clever and the film makers let Chevy Chase do exactly what he does best and delivers the dialogue like a comedy legend. The cast works so well together and its such an ensemble cast of wacky and zany characters and you can't help but fall in love with the entire Griswold family. Its a laugh out loud, slapstick, comedy classic.This was Chevy Chase at his best. Even now years later if you see him on Community he still delivers that awkward, gangly everyman type character that delivers outstanding one liners and hilarious dialogue. Clark Griswold is perfect and no one could do that role like Chase. You just love this guy no matter what through all his mistakes and stupid follies. I always thought that Beverly D'Angelo had a strange chemistry with Chevy Chase, they seem like polar opposites but yet their chemistry has always worked for the Vacation movies and still works perfectly in this one. She's definitely the straight man to the entire film and doesn't get a lot of the gags but she is Chevy Chase's perfect partner. Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are the Griswold children this time around and they are good and they fulfil their duties appropriately but neither one really stand out. One of the legendary performances in this film is that by Randy Quaid as the infamous Cousin Eddie. Quaid is downright brilliant as the white trash trailer park Cousin with a big heart but no brains. Him and Chase are brilliant together and you can't help but howl at his misfortunes and stupid blunders. The supporting cast are one of the best ensembles in movie history, all bringing about some of the best laughs ever. William Hickey, Mae Questel, Doris Roberts, John Randolph, and Miriam Flynn are a few of the truly stand out performances in supporting roles. Also deserving of mentioning is Brian Doyle-Murray in a small role as Chase's money hungry boss. Two performances that are wasted and pointless are that of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the annoyed neighbours. There is no purpose to them in the film and they are just more annoying than anything.The film makers, led by Canadian director Jeremiah Chechik, packed so much into this movie and yet it doesn't feel crowded. It feels like the perfect Holiday slapstick comedy. You feel like you become one of the Griswold's and partake in every moment of their insane holiday. Ridiculous physical comedy, hilarious chemistry between the cast makes this an absolute must see every Holiday season or even any time. This was director Chechik's debut and its easy to see why he's worked steadily in Hollywood since then, even in Television because he clearly has an eye for making a film feel right, pacing it right, and letting the actors do what they do best. This will make you fall in love with the Griswold's and see the whole series again and again! 9/10 "},{"Title":"Endearing entry in the Vacation series.","Date":"7 December 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Third Vacation movie finds star Chevy Chase in fine form, as perpetually stubborn Clark W. Griswold is determined to have a happy holiday at home with the family and the in-laws. What he didn't count on was the return of his cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, full of all the expected swagger and an absolute hoot), the ultimate hick, who brings along his family and his dog in an RV.What's great about this movie is how likable it remains even as it comes up with one ridiculous (yet funny) setback after another. The in-laws aren't the only things Clark will have to contend with there will also be an incident on the road with some redneck drivers, the attack of a psychotic squirrel, Eddie dumping his sewage into the storm drain, the inability to get Clarks' elaborately decorated house to light up, a pair of snot nosed, disapproving neighbours (one of them played by a pre-'Seinfeld' Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and a Yuletide visit by the local SWAT team!One has to admire Clark he soldiers on, running on a lot of heart even if he doesn't quite have the brains to match, and when he loses it in a couple of memorable, hysterical rants, they can't help but feel some sympathy for this guy. Director Jeremiah Chechik, working from a screenplay by John Hughes (who'd written the first Vacation and co-written the second), does a great job of mixing some genuinely poignant moments into all of the farcical highlights. There's some very quotable dialogue, especially from Clark and Eddie.It's great fun, too, to see so many familiar faces in this large cast; lovely Beverly D'Angelo is fine as usual as the long suffering wife Ellen; also appearing are Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki as the latest incarnations of Audrey and Rusty, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, Miriam Flynn, William Hickey, Sam McMurray, Nicholas Guest, and Natalia Nogulich. Mae Questel, long ago voice of Betty Boop, is a riot.Christmastime simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of this personal favourite. It starts out brightly and keeps the momentum going for a very enjoyable 98 minutes. In the words of Eddie, it's the gift that keeps on giving.Eight out of 10.

I have watched this many, many times since that first date - I wouldn't say every Christmas season, but probably most - and it never, ever gets stale. Even though there are parts of the dialogue I now know off by heart it still makes me laugh. Chevy Chase was born to play Clark Griswold. He's had the character nailed perfectly since his first appearance, and this is no exception. Clark is such a lovable guy. He's kind of irritating, he's a bit clumsy, he overdoes everything and he grumbles (and sometimes worse) a lot of the time, but he's a good guy. That side of him really comes out in this movie. Clark might grumble, but he loves having the family around him - even cousin Eddie (who thankfully returns after being absent from European Vacation) although he likely wouldn't admit it. He not only loves having his family around him, he loves his family - all of them. It's a simple scene, like the one in which he has his heart to heart chat with Eddie's little girl Ruby Sue about Santa Claus, that shows that off. He might look put off when Eddie goes overboard with his requests for Christmas presents after Clark tells him he'll buy them for him since Eddie has no money, but you know he doesn't really mind doing it. I like Clark. I'd be buddies with Clark.There's so much going on in this movie that works so well. The chaotic family gathering is really nothing more than a deliberate exaggeration of the experience so many people have in getting their families (in all their diversity) together for the holidays - which means that in a bizarre sort of way it's pretty easy to relate to. Then there's Clark's struggles with getting the 25,000 lights he's decorated his house with to turn on; the understandable frustrations of the neighbours in having to deal with this insane family living next door; the wild sled ride. And there's the cat. Oh the cat. The poor, poor cat! It's funny.Strangely, the weakest parts to this for me at least were the beginning and the end. Both seemed to go a little overboard. The battle with the truck driver at the beginning of the movie as the Griswold's were heading out to get their Christmas tree really doesn't grab me - in fact it comes across as silly (and not in a good way) - and the end, where cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss and brings him back to the house just seemed too much. But everything in between is astonishingly funny and well done.

It has taken me a while to decide exactly what I think of the film. It is a movie that I can never go through a Christmas without watching at least part of it. Although it plays homage to It's a Wonderful Life, it does not quite align itself as a classic, nor does it sustain itself in humor and delight as A Christmas Story. This movie is supposed to be over-the-top and sometimes it is difficult to suspend the disbelief. Randy Quaid as Eddie simultaneously induces nausea and laughter. That may be the best way to describe Christmas Vacation. There are maybe a total of twenty minutes that I now frequently skip in my annual Christmas watching. What can never be missed, however, are Any scene with Aunt Bethany, both attempts of lighting the house, all the scenes with Todd and Margot, the opening scene of finding the Christmas tree, the brilliant title animation, Clark Griswold's great monologue after receiving his bonus, and the payoff during the reading of Twas the Night Before Christmas.

But if you think that you have it bad, sit back and enjoy a real Christmas extravaganza. It's time for the Griswald Family Christmas!In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, we reunite with our favorite dysfunctional family, the Griswald's! Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase)will surely make this holiday season one to remember. Although his practices may seem unorthodox, he is just trying to make everyone happy, which isn't an easy thing to do. His parents and his in-laws will be spending the holiday's with Clark and his family, and all hell is about to break loose.Clark's passion for the holidays goes hand in hand with his obsession for over the top decorations. With his house drenched in lights and a Christmas tree too small for Paul Bunyon's living room, he's ready for St. Nick's arrival...but not cousin Eddy's. Randy Quaid rejoins the cast as the lovable, hillbilly relative. Like the three wise men, he comes bearing gifts a full septic tank, his dog Snotts, and charisma that could charm a cobra.So what makes complete anarchy the perfect Christmas movie? Well, aside from the laugh-out-loud comedy, the message is clear to get through the holidays in one piece, you have to overcome adversity and be thankful for what you have. Clearly, the comedy takes over the subtly message, but all together this is a quality film. Chase is absolutely hilarious as the fumbling, smart ass Clark. He and his wife Ellen (Beverley D'Angelo) make a nice on-screen couple that seems realistic enough.Christmas and comedy go together like nutmeg on eggnog. It's the perfect fit! Christmas Vacation will become an instant addition to your family's movie collection and possible a tradition around the holidays. No matter how many times you see it there is always something new to laugh at again and again and again. Do not miss out on this holiday gold mine!

What he doesn't anticipate is one relative that decides to show up unannounced.  His cousin-in-law, Eddie (Quaid). The friction between the two is hysterical and possibly even funnier than in the first (especially since in the first they had about two scenes together, while in this they have almost the whole movie with one another.).

Our family has been doing it for years now and it was a pleasant surprise to learn that many other families do it as well.This excellent satire series of the stress that a father (Chevy Chase) goes through to insure a fantastic holiday for his family. This time around it is the Christmas season. And the WHOLE gang is here. Mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts and of course Cousin Eddie. The Griswold household has to hold under the constant stress of the season with some completely hilarious moments including the sled ride, the green gutter ooze, and the tree!Oh man, just thinking about this films moments makes me chuckle. Chevy Chase is excellent as the father trying to coup, and the rest of the cast is also very funny, very good. It is a very great comedy and it deserves to be part of our Christmas traditions.

They're having a Christmas vacation. Clark wants to have a fun old fashioned family Christmas. They start it off by going into the woods to find the perfect Christmas tree.           They dig it out of the ground because Clark forgot a saw. They bring it home and find it's really quite big; Clark is expecting his Christmas bonus from his surly boss, Mr. Shirley. One afternoon, the family showes up! Clark's mom and dad and Ellen's mom and dad who are in competition with one another. Clark and Rusty also put up the Christmas lights. Clark wants to use all 25,000. Clark has a few ups and downs. Mostly downs when he falls off the ladder.            Next morning, Clark goes into the attic to hide some presents. But while he was up there, the attic door is closed on him and thefamily is heading out! Clark is now home alone in the attic, but he amuses himself with old home movies from 1955. That night, Clark tries once again to light the house lights. They don't work and he can't figure out the problem, so he throws a fit. Ellen figures out the problem and turns on the lights. 25,000 lights glowing bright white.Right then, Cousin Eddie and Catherine, and their kids arrive. They came in a big RV that Eddie borrowed off a friend of his.           Clark's bonus still hasn't come. He's really beginning to worry. He wants to put in a swimming pool. He already put a depositon it, and that's what's got him worried. That night, they go sledding. Clark greased the bottom with a varnish from his company. The sled zips down the hill and into a WalMart, where he crashed into a charity drop-off box. The next day he watches Eddie empty a chemical toiletinto Clark's sewer and also learns that Eddie's kids, Rocky and Ruby Sue, may not get a visit from Santa because they're broke. So Clark helps out.         Christmas eve. Clark brings home geriatric Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany, Bethany is 80 and on the senile side. The presents they brought consist of Bethany's cat and lime jello. At dinner, the turkey explodes, Clark's tree is burned down, and the cat was fried. On the plus side, Clark's bonus arrived, but it turned out be an enrollment in the Jelly of the Month club. Clark goes crazy and says he'd like as a last minute gift idea, Frank Shirley, his boss, in his house with a ribbon on his head and would really like to tell him off, so Eddie takes off to find him. Clark finds another tree and they redecorate, but the tree had a squirrel in it that drove everyone up the wall. It soon runs out, and then in comes Eddie with Mr. Shirley tied up and wearing a big ribbon. Problems and differences are worked out, and soon the feds arrived, but charges were dropped.There's a celebration and Clark is relieved that he did it. He had his fun old fashioned family Christmas.         Well, this Vacation movie was an improvment over European Vacation! It is much better. Also, I don't know if this is really a sequel to it, because the kids' ages are different. Rusty is supposed to be older than Audrey, but he's a lad in this movie. Sadly, stars from the movie E.G. Marshall, William Hickey, and Mae Questal are dead. They'll be remembered though. It's a good Christmas film. I recommend it!

Though I think the first Vacation is the best, this movie certainly holds a place in my movie-loving heart. Chevy Chase gives another successful performance as Clark Griswald, your everyday suburban smuck trying to deal with the holidays and relatives.Like all the other vacation movies, this movie is the continuing Griswald family adventures in everyday mundane life. However, once the Griswalds undertake any project, things are bound to go wrong with hilarious results. Nothing new or original to the plot, but silly family comedies don't need a strong plot as long as they are funny. I personally find this movie to be very funny, so it works for me.FINAL RATING 8/10  I give it a high rating despite noticeable shortcomings in plot and other areas mainly because of its ties to my childhood Christmas.

The best Vacation yet!","Date":"22 June 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Here is my favorite of the series. Christmas Vacation (aka National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) is the best, funniest movie in the Vacation series. This, the third in the series, brings back the big laughs that were featured in the first film and was frequently missing in the second film. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles from the first two films as Clark and Ellen Griswold. This time though there's a major change. Instead of the Griswolds taking a vacation out of town, they stay at home and relatives take vacations to visit them. This was a very good idea. At least they don't repeat something from the first two films. Among the visitors filling up the Griswold household Clark's parents Clark Sr. and Nora (John Randolph and Diane Ladd); Ellen's parents Art and Francis (the late E.G. Marshall and current Everybody Loves Raymond star Doris Roberts); Cousins Eddie and Catherine (Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn, reprising their roles from the first Vacation movie), two of their kids, and their dog; and dotty, senile Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany (wonderfully played by two late longtime veterans, William Hickey and Mae Questel). Lots of big laughs here. Some of the slapstick highlights the Griswold's trip to get the perfect Christmas tree; Clark's adventures of decorating the house with 25,000 light bulbs; Clark's bigtime sleighride after putting a slippery substance on the sled; Clark's day locked in the attic; the in-laws constant bickering at each other; Cousin Eddie's constant slobbering; Christmas Eve craziness; and so on. This is probably Chevy Chase's best film, with the original Vacation right behind. Just about everyone gets a big laugh in the film (including Julia Louis-Dreyfus of Seinfeld as the Griswold's next-door neighbor who can't stand Clark). The scene stealer is Quaid, who's naturally funny everytime he's on screen. So is Hickey and Questel. The movie also features then teen actors Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki before they reached big time roles (she in Cape Fear; he on TV's Rosanne). Christmas Vacation is a perfect movie to watch at Christmastime. But you can watch it anytime. Great, hilarious fun from beginning to end.**** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Christmas mayhem!","Date":"6 June 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I have seen this movie about 20 times (I'm exaggerating) since 1990, and it's one of my all-time favorites.

I'll probably never forget the scene where Clark flips out and says all those bad things about his boss, or when he's flying down the hill on the saucer.The Christmas lights not working is something out of reality for me, because my father puts up the lights every year (not 25,000 imported twinkle lights) and some of the strands go out.

This is pretty silly. But once the Christmas lights go up, I am hooked into the best satire there is of Christmas in the good old USA. You want overblown decorations, visitors who never leave, the focus on buying things or the family gatherings where people can barely stand each other? It's all here but done in such a hilarious way, and with a kernel of truth, that you know you are laughing at your own holiday experiences as much as at the movie.  The Vacation series is about exaggeration but while Chase is over the top, we can all identify with him. He just needs a good script and this and the first Vacation deliver. The film's pace is crisp, the supporting cast is solid and it all leads up to a great climax. If silly satire is your movie comedy cup of tea, you will have a hard time doing better than Christmas Vacation.

Chase and fam decide to stay home this time, and relitives even weirder than them (imagine that) drop by for a stay.  Hughes, just before his downhill days of the 90s, manages to put in some of his patented nasty humor, like the Christmas light cat moment or Eddie (a returning Quaid) emptying his mobile home toilet into the gutter.  Some moments stretch the slapstick level to an annoying level, such as Chases 5 mile sled ride or when he takes plank after plank to the head in the attic.  The cast, if overlarge, is good, though they miscast the kids as far as appearances go.  Rusty is now brown haired and about 4 feet tall and Audrey has turned into a skinny blonde chick.  And they're not given as much to do as in the previous films.  But theres enough good moments to entertain (the lighting of the house is now classic) and some nice songs to bring out the holiday feel.  One by Ray Charles while Chase watches home movies and the end credit song aptly named Christmas Vacation.  Nice 3rd entry into the series.

Heartwarming and hilarious, this festive favourite will guarantee a very merry time.Chase plays Clark Griswold, a well intentioned family man whose plans for the perfect Christmas go disastrously wrong the thousands of lights that adorn his home refuse to work; his in-laws argue with his parents; the Christmas tree goes up in flames; he is trapped in the attic while hiding his gifts; a sledging incident almost costs him his life; the turkey is overdone; his embarrassing hick relatives turn up expectedly for the holidays; a wild squirrel invades the home; and worst of all, his bonus cheque seems to have gone missing in the post.Naturally, by the time Christmas Day arrives, Clark is a complete nervous wreck, and when he discovers that his Christmas bonus is a 'year's membership to a jelly club', rather than the expected cash bonus, his temper finally snaps (of course, this being a good natured Christmas tale, everything turns out right in the end, thanks to the intervention of dumb, but well-meaning Cousin Eddie).Written by 80s comedy genius John Hughes, Christmas Vacation's script is bristling with very funny lines of dialogue, but it is the visual gags that get the biggest laughs Clark somehow driving the family saloon between the wheels of a huge truck; the bushy tailed rodent clinging to Clark's back; the sight of Clark careering across a freeway on a well oiled sled. Chase gives one of his most memorable performances, making Clark a thoroughly likable character that one can't help but admire, despite his failures, and he is given able support by a superb cast that includes Beverly D'Angelo as his long suffering wife Ellen, Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and Juliette Lewis as his daughter Audrey.And the best thing about the film? You can watch it time after time and it'll always put a smile on your face; it really is the gift that keeps on giving.

This time, everything goes awry at their place. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Clark (Chase) goes overboard with the Christmas lights to find they don't work and manages to have assorted objects smack him in the face or take him out completely on numerous occasions. The grandparents are completely off their rockers and the kids can't stand it. Then of course what would a family Christmas be without their hick cousins the Johnsons, especially their father figure, Eddie (Randy Quaid) who is more reckless and stupid than ever in effort to push Clark over the brink.80s comedy mastermind Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the other 2 vacation movies) pretty much decided to stuff everything he included in the tons of other comedies he wrote in the decade into this film. It has everything from extreme physical comedy to wacky relatives to animals causing mayhem. That's why it's so predictable, but of course Hughes is also the master of reminding us of our family values and keeping them close (easy enough in a Christmas film). The comedy starts out rusty but once the ball gets rolling Christmas Vacation gets harder to roll your eyes at. The subtle outlandish humor and hi-jinx win you over every time.Chevy Chase remains the glue of the Vacation films. Every man feels like Clark Griswold at times (trouble at work, extra-marital temptations, putting all their effort into something to fail or be under-appreciated) and every person has or knows a dad like Clark Griswold. He's the epitome of the Hallmark greeting card Dad. Without his ho-hum but quick to heat up personality that Chase nails down, these films wouldn't be as good; it would be harder to get past the predictable slapstick.

To me, it's just another effort for the Saturday Night Live gang to scrape the last few remaining bucks out of moviegoers at the time (Christmas 1989). They say you should find the good in everything you do, so the good that I found in this movie was that my in-laws worked at a cinema in her hometown and we got to see this film for free.

Not a huge fan, but noteworthy. I'm 34 and have somehow managed to never see this flick. So when I jumped on Amazon to purchase a slew of Christmas movies this year, and ran across this hidden jewel, I was very excited. Lots of good feedback on it.This has got to be the poorest performance of Chase's career. He completely coasted through all the witless dialogue. It was as if someone wrote the script over the weekend. The bloopers are very obvious, and the jokes are antiquated even for the 80s. The sets, or lack thereof, were so drab that I think they intentionally threw in the Nicolette Scorcese scenes just to distract us as much as the main character. The only actor who showed an ounce of spark was Randy Quaid, but his character was so redneck and purile that it was hard to like him.1989 was an earlier era in filmaking, a more innocent time when shoestring budgets and obvious comedy were more invisible to the viewer. It's possible I could have found this amusing if I'd caught it in it's hayday, and subsequently relegated the film to cherished memory of yester decade status. But unfortunately, I saw it for the first, and now last, time tonight. This disk is a coaster.

If stuff goes pear-shaped, it's THEIR problem... You're just an innocent bystander.Amongst all the chaos, there's some nugget that no matter how miserable your Xmas is...

The movie has the Griswolds, not going on a family trip of any kind, but rather having a nice family vacation right in their own home. You know the type, the one where everyone comes together to celebrate the xmas season together as the parents of both spouses are there. You know the type, hell in your house type scenario. Why anyone would subject themselves to the kind of torture that can only come from having as many family members under one roof is beyond me. We also know the Griswolds do not have the best track record when it comes to planning that perfect vacation. Not only do they have trouble getting a tree right from the get go they also have pandemonium when the in-laws arrive. Clark has run ins with his yuppie neighbors, of course he would be living by people like this. It always seems people who like to decorate their house get stuck by the ones who like the minimal xmas and vice versa and boy does Clark believe in a lot of lights. Of course, once he gets them all put up there is a bit of a trick to getting them on. Then guess who stops by, but the relatives that are not invited in the form of good ol cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid stealing the show a bit in this one). So there you have it, a more realistic movie than European to be sure, but I still liked it a bit better and of this one the first one and European I like this one the least. Never saw Vegas, from the previews it did not look all that good to me. However, this one is still funny and even though I consider it the weakest it is actually rather strong for a xmas movie.

This film is a must see during the holiday season, the laughs just get you into the spirit of Christmas so much! You again have the comedy legend himself Chevy Chase returning for a third round in the Lampoon Vacation series, this time the theme is Christmas. As anybody knows when you have a Hughes film and another vacation film with Chase you will have plenty of slapstick comedy and laughs! Clark Griswold(Chevy Chase) vows his clan will enjoy the most fun-filled family Christmas ever! So oh boy get ready for the crazy mishaps, just scene after scene is hilarious, some of my favorites are when Clark gets tongue-tied in the shopping mall at a lingerie counter in front of that sexy female clerk! Also inside the home once the family gathers around the crazy scene of 25,000 lights on the roof. The family Christmas eve dinner is just a mess from an exploding turkey to cat food mixed in the jello! The living room and the Christmas tree don't have any better luck either, as the family experiences capital punishment on a cat, and a forest fire on a Christmas tree! A merry and jolly supporting cast make this film enjoyable also as Beverly D' Angelo is back as Clark's cool wife and Juliette Lewis is adorable as Clark's teen daughter. The rest of the family clan is played perfect by veterans like John Randolph, E.G. Marshall and William Hickey who all in my mind are legends. Just to mention crazy country cousin Eddie returns and he's around for the holiday as always this character is played just fine by Randy Quaid. Before her big fame, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a small part as Clark's snobbish sexy next door neighbor. Overall this film is a script full of wit, and fine moments just like when Clark has memories watching old holiday films in the attic! Mainly the sheer goofiness makes people love this at Christmas time. This is one of the best Christmas films around, and this is my mother's favorite Christmas movie too, this is a must watch every Christmas.

Griswold, Jr. (the ever swarmy Chevy Chase), and his dream to give his family and old-fashioned Christmas, not matter what it takes. The film is essentially a series of skits about the holidays and family strung together on Clark's dream to have as many people from his family in his house for the holidays. The primary thing we need to remember while watching this movie is that Clark is an idiot, but a lovable one. He wants a great Christmas, so he loads up his family, wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), daughter (a young Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) in the station wagon to get their tree. A tree lot? No... of course not. The middle of the woods, quite possibly in Canada (heck of a drive from their suburban Chicago home) to get their tree. With a saw? No, he forgot it. That's the first of the many sketches that make up the film. Most are funny, the funniest probably involves a squirrel loose in the house, and great-aunt Bethany adds comedic nonsense to the end of the movie. Most of the things that happen in the movie wouldn't happen to ordinary people, we aren't that dumb, but rather the film holds true to the old axiom what can go wrong will go wrong, which usually happens during the holidays. Seeing someone else have trouble during the holidays makes us feel better, and we get some chuckles out of it too.

I LOVED this movie as a kid &#x96; I did watch it repeatedly back then, but after a nearly 15 year hiatus of not seeing it, it felt really dated to me.That said, I still laughed, admired the cartoonish feel they gave to these live-action characters and the scenes of genuine heart. I would still recommend it, especially for fans of Clark Griswold and his crazy antics and it still remains as my favorite Vacation movie.I'm not 100% sure there really is a plot here, but the premise is Clark and Co. are determined to have a true family Christmas, but are consistently sidetracked with annoying relatives, angry neighbors, mischievous animals and a stereotypical Hollywood Christmas boss.Despite the lack of any real script, the movie does have focus and a lot of fun. It's slapstick and silly and actually tugs at your heart at times. It's not a movie to take seriously and if you just sit back and enjoy, you'll really have a good time.Side Note and Spoiler &#x96; skip this paragraph if you have not seen it Maybe I noticed this before, but I really don't recall how they ended the movie without even making it to Christmas Day was thoroughly disappointing. It was as if they knew the movie was running too long, and it was, and cut it short of the actual day the movie's based on. And titled as such. Sad.Side Note II I also might not have noticed this before, but the boy who replaced the boy who replaced the original Griswold son, Rusty, was played by long time crush of mine (just one-year-younger than me) Johnny Galecki. It was truly weird seeing someone that I've grown to like a lot since I've last see this film, as a freaking boy. Thankfully, that's not how I remember him these days.Side Note III Speaking of the children, since this movie was released, I have been all-but 100% against seeing Juliette Lewis. I cannot stand her. Even though she plays an integral part, mercifully, she's hardly in this. In fact, Rusty, or Galecki, has more screen time. Perhaps because both his character and lines were a lot funnier. "}{"Title":"Overall, 'Christmas Vacation' establishes itself as one of the best Christmas films to emerge out of Tinseltown in the last twenty years, along with 'Home Alone' and 'Gremlins'","Date":"23 February 2003","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  National Lampoon's Christmas VacationIn this third installment of the widely successful and popular `Vacation' franchise, Chevy Chase returns to his role of Clark Griswold, along with Beverly D'Angelo as his wife Ellen. Also along for the ride is Randy Quaid, reprising his role as Uncle Eddie from the first film.`Christmas Vacation' doesn't really take the same formula as the first `Vacation' film, but it certainly is as funny. What I mean when I say, `The formula isn't the same,' is that the original film was about a family taking a road trip across America; the humor was restricted to jokes regarding road travel. The second film did the same, but became tiresome after a while.Now, `Christmas' works in the restraints of not a road travel comedy, but of a Christmas comedy the family coming, the frustrations and aggravations of&#133;Christmas! But also, the film captures the pure joy of Christmas at the same time, as the first film did with traveling.Perhaps the fact that John Hughes, writer of `Vacation,' wrote this film; I feel he did so because he wanted to get the series back on track after the first sequel. In an interview once, James Cameron said of `Terminator 2' `I knew the sequel would be made; I wanted to carry it on in the right direction and not let it stray from the right path&#133;' or something vaguely familiar to that. I feel that is what John Hughes did with this film. I think, in his mind, he thought this would be the last sequel, and he wanted to end it with a bang. Of course, almost a decade later in 1997, audiences were introduced to `Vegas Vacation,' which is, in my opinion, an underrated comedy, but I'll get into that in my next `Vacation' review.Clark Griswold has finally settled in for a peaceful Christmas with his family, including children Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki). The family is coming, including Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Sr. (John Randolph), Nora Griswold (Diane Ladd), Art (E.G. Marshall), and Doris Roberts as loudmouth Frances.Only this year, Clark has made sure that EVERYTHING will go as planned. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for us (very much so!), Clark's planning will be to no avail, as everything, much the same in the previous films, will go to pieces and this Christmas will be just as crazy as the Christmases before.Chevy Chase found his roots in the `Vacation' films; I really do not enjoy him as a regular actor/comedian, but he is perfect as Clark Griswold. He is extremely gung-ho, and has all these crazy notions and the idea of an absolute perfect vacation built up in his head, and it is more than enjoyable as we watch them wither away while he loses his cool.Beverly D'Angelo is, as I said in my review on the first film, surprisingly convincing as a housewife. I would never expect for her to work as an average mother, but behold, she does.The kids in this new movie are good. They may not be as great as Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron were, but their attitudes fit the characters for THIS script much better Audrey has a bigger attitude and Rusty is younger and more innocent.And in this movie, the filmmakers return to what helped make the first movie so good Cousin Eddie. I think his lack of presence in the second film really harmed its reputation, but this film brings him back in a hilarious introduction sequence outside the house (`Eddie?!).All in all, the film has some excellent gags and parodies the Christmas season we all go through very, very well. While I don't think it is quite as good as the first `Vacation' movie, it is almost as good. The reason it's hard to evaluate in comparison is because it is so different from the original; the formula as I said before is entirely different.In fact, director Jeremiah S. Chechik seems to give the film an entirely different overtone. The first film had an orange tint to it, in a way, because it took place in summer and the Griswold family drove through some very dry areas. In this movie, it is Christmas, and the cinematography is&#133;bleaker? Weighed down? Darker? Not in a bad way, in a good way. It suits the film. But all these little tidbits make it harder to efficiently compare the two films together because they are so different.Overall, `Christmas Vacation' establishes itself as one of the best Christmas films to emerge out of Tinseltown in the last twenty years, along with `Home Alone.' It just parodies the season we all love so well, that it has become, for me, a Christmas tradition. I watch it at LEAST once a year around Christmas, but usually five, six, maybe seven times a year. Sometime I'm going to have to buy it on DVD and stop watching a taped NBC broadcast of the film.`Christmas Vacation' gets 4.5/5 stars from me &#150; it's a great satire.John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Awful, non-funny comedy","Date":"2 December 2000","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  How do people like this movie?

If it weren't for Cousin Eddie in the movie, it would be down to a 4. I really thought the beginning wasn't exciting except for the store scene, but when Eddie came, the movie went up two ratings.

It's a lot better than the crappy 2nd one European Vacation. It is also better than Vacation and Vegas Vacation also. This one did the best at the movies way back in '89. There is a reason for this. It's ******* awesome!!!! This time Clark wants a quiet Christmas at home with his family and all their relatives. That all changes when Cousin Eddie (played once again by the awesome Randy Quaid) himself makes an appearance. When Eddie makes an appearance that is when the movie gets a hell of a lot funnier. Actually the whole damn movie is funny. The part I love is when Clark is stapling the Christmas lights on the roof and he staples his shirt. I started laughing my ass off at that scene and also when the raccoon gets loose inside the house!!! There are 25,000 lights on the roof, an exploding turkey on the dining room table, and a S.W.A.T. team taking siege outside. This and A Christmas Story are the only 2 movies I watch around Christmas. I used to watch Home Alone but that was before I got into the Vacation series. Christmas Vacation is a hell of a lot better than all 4 of the Home Alone movies. A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation are 2 of the best Christmas movies ever made!!!!!! Trust me, if you have'not seen C.V. what the **** are you waiting for??

Yeah, there were a few moments where I chuckled, but there were other moments were I didn't.I think this flick is mostly popular amongst people because of the nostalgia factor, not really because of the excellent writing, directing, or even the acting. Nostalgic doesn't mean better - it just means you're more attached to it.I liked the fact David from Roseanne is in this; I like Chevy Chase that he's in here - really liked him in Man of the House with Jonathan Taylor Thomas. And Cousin Eddy does manage to get a few chuckles here and there. And especially the sledding scene was hysterical to watch! But, like typical crude Hollywood, they manage to include at least one f-word, lots of other crude language, lots of accidents happening & things breaking, weird relatives, next-door neighbors who's purpose serves none other than to be annoyed or disturbed by Clark & his family. I mean take a look at Home Alone - that film is so popular because it had effort, brought in a big studio that could take care of it, a child actor that could act, lovely music, and all sorts of elements here and there that made it liked by the general audience.With all that said, again, John Hughes went on to make better, more appropriate and family-friendly films during the 90's. And a lot of his older films were just HARD to like or enjoy. And no this isn't a Christmas Classic.This film is one of those - 4/10 - little good, so much bad.PS I'm glad I never had an older sister who liked John Hughes' older 80's movies.

It produced a different concept of following a family and all their crazy adventures. It was a series that besides Vegas Vacation showed Chevy Chase in his prime as a comedic actor and also many series can't say they used every rating from R, PG-13 and PG for the various films which shows it's a series that works for everyone.That said, every one especially knows about the third film in the series, Christmas Vacation. It is said to be a classic Christmas film, and is well known by non-fans of film industry. The film is something you can just find on about every station during Christmas time even though it is now more than twenty years old and I don't see this dying anytime soon. Call me crazy me though, because for me Christmas Vacation is just a merely an above average film.In the heart of Chicago, the Griswold family craziness begins during Christmas time. The Griswold extended family is here with Clark (Chevy Chase), his trashy brother Eddie (Randy Quaid) and the rest of the family. Clark deals a lot of stuff including Christmas lights, presents, a Christmas bonus issue and really everything that comes with Christmas.I could just be nitpicking and maybe the Christmas scrooge has come out from inside of me but Christmas Vacation suffers from a lack of plot. Most of film is wandering around in an 80's style house watching a family who don't know the ways of life. With the setting being just a house, it shows off the low $27 million budget, and I don't know why the movie is called Christmas Vacation because the family doesn't go anywhere. Christmas Vacation is full of sex, bathroom humor, old people and dysfunctional family jokes that are typical in comedy films.I think if a film is going to use just one setting, then it really needs to rely on the characters. The main star of the film and the father of the family, Clark Griswold (Chase) can't seem to do anything right and has numerous problems. He is an annoyance and by the end of the movie it just becomes too much. The mother of the Griswolds is Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) who is innocent in all of this and really doesn't seem to fit into this craziness. The kids are Audrey Griswold (Juliette Lewis) who is a bitchy teen who has problems with just about about everything and the younger brother is Russ Griswold (Johnny Galecki) who does nothing noteworthy. From Uncle Lewis (William Hickey) to Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel), the old people in this story are what some old people are. They are off in there own world and have no purpose or able to relate at all to the present time. The only character that really earns his keep and is worth watching is Eddie (Quaid) who's pretty funny and who has some heart. Still, none of these family members has an inch of character development.This movie has the Christmas spirit and is original to the series so I see a reason why some people call it a classic. To me though, it just has too little on substance, has big flaws on the important parts and really all I got out of it was some smiles. Christmas Vacation is an easily watchable movie but it is a film I would rather choose to forget than to remember.

I respect their opinion, and so I sat down to watch it with high expectations.It started out well. I laughed quite a bit at the ridiculousness of the jokes and the setup of the movie thus far. I quite liked the idea of an affectionate, but rather incompetent father. I think the part was very well played out, and up until the thirtieth minute or so, I had no complaints. However, after that, I began to get bored. Frankly, the jokes went from good to fake and cliché, and on some, I simply shook my head and wondered 'Who would find this funny?'There were some moments in the later films that made me hope that the bad jokes were just a minor lapse, and the movie would get right back on track... but apart from these rare moments of shining, the rest of the movie seemed dull and uninteresting. The plot really is no big deal it's quite common, the incompetent family bonding at Christmas, but this film got nowhere near the laughs and simultaneous seriousness that films like 'The Ref' achieved. This movie stands on it's jokes alone, and, frankly, they aren't that good.It is not a horrible movie. I'll give this movie a 5.8 total. Round that up to a six.

It is just about Clark Griswold again and his family enduring another one of his over the top family gathering ideas. This involves all the usual prat falls and slapstick humor you've come to expect. The only difference is, here it is actually funny if you allow it to be.But like the other two vacation movies he is in, Randy Quaid steals the movie as Cousin Eddie. An inbred sort of character who is as is said of Homer in the first season of the Simpsons Either a below avg. human or a brilliant beast.The movie also has a subplot of Clark needing his Christmas bonus check to come in so he can cover the check he wrote for a swimming pool.The thing that makes this movie work is that it never even tries to take itself seriously. For the most part it avoids sappy moments and trying to have a moral at the end.The knocks are, some of the jokes are just stupid and they could have used a little more high brow humor (bodily function jokes can only be at laughed so much). This is by no means a great comedy but it is a staple for me at Christmas time.

Having said that, this is only the second NATIONAL LAMPOON film I've watched &#x96; after the similarly overrated ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) &#x96; and the film itself is the third VACATION with Chevy Chase and Beverly D' Angelo playing the Griswolds.The film starts amiably enough with the amusing animated opening credits, the car chase and tree cutting sequences but slowly starts going downhill once the other members of the family come into the picture. Apart from the fact that it seemed exaggerated to me to have relatives calling at the house for the Christmas dinner from a couple of weeks earlier, Chevy's losing it completely antics after not getting his all-important (why?)

If you love B and C grade actors (yesterday I saw one with Tori Spelling AND Gary Coleman!), this would have to be your favourite time of the year. Probably one of the better ones going around though would be National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.The movie again focuses on the Griswald's, this time though they are spending Christmas at home with the extended family. Besides Eddie and Katherine, they are all new characters, none of whom are given more than a handful of lines or appearances to do anything. Clark (Chevy Chase) has about 90% of the dialogue and screen time, which is probably a good thing. The movie revolves around Clark and his aim to have a perfect family Christmas. If you've seen the other Vacation's, you'll know this will prove impossible as Clark keeps goofing off and hilarious consequences abound.It's certainly not a landmark movie, but it has a few good scenes, and it scores extra purely because it's a Christmas movie that doesn't send you to sleep. It's basically more of the same of the ingredients from the first 2 Vacation's, with a weaker ensemble and less material to work with. Cosuin Eddie (Randy Quaid) holds his own and provides the best support to Chevy Chase. Other well known actors appearing in the movie are Juliette Lewis, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss and Doris Roberts.

Christmas Vacation is a film that deals with many a Christmas issues and binds them all together in a reasonably satisfying way even if it feels heavy handed and somewhat juvenile at certain times.At its core, Christmas Vacation is a film that challenges the American idea, or perhaps the Western idea, of what Christmas is. There is nothing religious in this film and if there is any mention of Jesus Christ, the real reason there is a Christmas, then I must've missed it. Clark Griswold (Chase) is an American who has a family; a well paid job and a 'prefect' detached suburban house with a picket fence and a people carrier. For him and his family (who are a little less than perfect) Christmas is everything he is expected (as the man of the house who puts the turkey on the table) to risk life and limb in order to staple lights to the roof; he is expected to be able to host a huge Christmas day and he is expected to out class the neighbours when it comes to front yard decorations amongst other things.Bizarrely enough, the funniest parts of Christmas Vacation come in the form of its scenes involving animals. When the cat chews the lights under the chair and gets a shock, I laughed likewise when a squirrel gets loose in the house, the initial sighting of the animal is when the joke's at its funniest but this seems to be a concept that had worn thin by the time Schwarzenegger was chased by a Reindeer around his neighbour's house in Jingle All the Way. Christmas Vacation as a film tests that theory that family is the most important thing at Christmas because, when you pick the film apart, the over crowded house full of finicky family members at Christmas is the films overall pitch. Take away the rest of the family and the nasty hillbilly stereotypes that turn up in the form of Eddie (Quaid) and you don't have a film, you have a 'How to have a perfect Western Christmas' demonstration. It's also a shame that pure idiocy spawns most of Christmas Vacation's jokes. Clark sees fit to staple the lights to his house (how will he get them off afterwards?) in an attempt to go to extremes for his family and a mere week long holiday but doesn't take due care and attention. He also attempts to light up the lights in a big unveiling to the whole family but idiotically, doesn't check them beforehand. Again, Clark is willing to go to such a length that he doesn't even want to spoil the surprise of the lights for himself so that he can share the first experience with his entire household. Either that or he's a complete idiot for not checking the plugs.Christmas Vacation isn't pure farce but it isn't too far off. This is one of the film's plus points in the sense it remains sober in its attempt to portray humour which is clearly aimed at children for 80% of the time. Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush was in a home of some sort with snow and cold on the outside trying to survive the whole ordeal with two others; Clark is this in a sense. But the similarities continue in the sense of slapstick with Chritsmas Vacation containing some iffy humour in the form of flatulence and downright stupidity which are embedded into this film whereas The Gold Rush used slapstick and genuinely funny situations; probably due to the fact it wasn't aimed at children Christmas Vacation smashed neighbour's windows; Clark kicks his model reindeer's away as he lashes out at what suburban society demands you have on your lawn; there is a lot of running around once a squirrel gets loose and an insane event which acts as reason to get a SWAT team around. These incidences may humour and entertain children but for the rest of us come on, are we really finding this funny? The only thing I could really tag onto and smirk at throughout is the way Chevy Chase portrays Clark. His deadpan and downer performance of a man seemingly on the edge of not only his family but his work and his Westernised holiday is a good example of a performance carrying a film. For everyone else, Ellen (D'Angelo) is the submissive of sorts wife; the children are not developed beyond anything they need to be and the rest of the family fill in the blanks with good grounds for argument that there are too many of them. Eddie Johnson's character, like I said, and his family are really bad examples of exploiting a certain race/class/gender/sexuality (delete as appropriate) in a negative and demeaning light; something I'd expect a Disney film to do subconsciously.But then again, the film is cheery and fun in a way. It starts off in a way that is akin to a 'Naked Gun' film and I liked two out of those three films and despite loosing ground on quality at various stages, Christmas Vacation deals with deeper subject matter such as trying to host the perfect American family Christmas and how far one should go to achieve these things. The humour may be lagging behind its pacing and variation of jokes but the film has a charm that, let's face it; is only there thanks to Chase's portrayal of the 'man stuck in a no win situation' character; much like Keaton and much like Chaplin.
