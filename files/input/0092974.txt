I didn't think it was a bad movie, but I didn't think that it was a good movie either. However, after seeing the movie a second time, I grew to appreciate the crazy antics of Ernest and he instantly became one of my favorite movie characters.  It is in ERNEST GOES TO CAMP that Ernest is at his best. The movie contains some hilarious scenes between Ernest and the campers, which help make this one of the best summer camp movies ever. Jim Varney, possibly the most underrated actor of the 1990s, was able to create such a unique and interesting character with this movie that it is really hard to dislike Ernest.

Worrell (Jim Varney).  Many of us had seen the Ernest & Vern commercials prior to the film's release, but the movie gave all of us a special glimpse into the life of this simple country boy.In this particular film Ernest is the lone handyman at Kamp Kikakee, a summer camp for young boys, whose premise is based on ancient Native American principles and traditions.  Ernest enjoys his job and simple life very much, but he longs to be promoted to the position of camp counselor so he can shape and mold young minds into a focused world view.  Ernest may just get his chance...The state governor has ordered the camp to take part in his Second Chance program, which will allow a group of juvenile deliquents from the State Institute for Boys to take part in the camp's activities, and, hopefully, clean up their acts.The evil, military-minded Counselor Stennis - who is almost reminiscent of Douglas Niedermeyer from Animal House - takes a crack at knocking the second-chancers into place, but strikes out when they stage a coup and break his ankle.  Head Counselor/Manger Tipton is in a bind.  He knows none of his counselors will want to take charge of the deliquent boys now, so he enlists naive Ernest to do the job.Ernest takes his new duties, and the boys, very seriously, but the boys could care less about him, until the camp nurse sets them straight (i.e., Ernest is the only person in the world who even wanted to know you). Meanwhile, a strip mining company on the upper part of the river has been trying to talk Chief St. Cloud, owner of the campgrounds, into turning the land over to them so they can mine the land for petrocite.  The Chief, who speaks no english, turns the mining company down twice, through his granddaughter (the camp nurse).  Lo and behold, Sherman Krader, the mining company CEO, cons Ernest - the only other person at the camp who can speak the Chief's native Indian language - into getting the Chief to sign the release papers.The camp is going to close.  The second-chancers will be sent back to the state institution.  This looks like a job for ERNEST!  He and the deliquents devise a plan to scare away the strip mining company, which involves blowing up all of their equipment.  The plan doesn't really work because Sherman Krader arrives on the scene with a fully-loaded rifle to shoot ring-leader Ernest (and...let's face it...in the real world Ernest and the kids would have been sued because of their thoughtless plan).  Luckily though, the camp nurse went behind them all and got the judge to issue a restraining order against the mining company.  Later, Krader's attorney admits that they bamboozled the Chief so the camp is saved, the second-chancers get to stay at the camp year-round, and Ernest becomes a full-fledged counselor (although he still performs his handyman duties).A string of inferior Ernest films were released, up until Jim Varney's death a few years ago (he was 51).  Ernest Goes to Camp is the only one worth seeing, unless you have children who might enjoy the films. I was nine years-old when I saw this flick in the theater, and I still enjoy it!  Saw it on DVD for the first time today!

Through pain and pranks he manages to build their confidence. A very tacked-on subplot about an evil businessman wanting scam the Indian camp owner in order to mine the area into oblivion builds to a moderately entertaining climax as Ernest and the kids revolt.It reminded me a lot of Meatballs and Bushwhacked (both better films) and while it's shot for the big screen (in lovely anamorphic Panavision) John Cherry still directs like it's for TV, and clearly should have done more takes and rehearsals. I doubt kids will notice or care, but it gives the film the rushed feel of a TV production.Worth watching, if only just once.

Even if he was not the typical man, he was still someone I looked up to and laughed with and I saw someone that could entertain with a heart.Ernest Goes to Camp was a movie I finally got my hands on following my multiple views of (Part II) Ernest Saves Christmas and (Part III) Ernest Goes to Jail. Back in those days, movies weren't always readily available. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed back then with this outing when I already was in love with the improved sequels.In today's times, I'm still on the fence. I did have fun, and did laugh a lot with this romp of a camp counselor wannabe, but it wasn't as good as I remember his follow-ups to be.What is nice about the character Ernest, from the dearly departed Jim Varney, was how big his heart was and how well he could connect with children, even as an adult. Literally, despite the slapstickness of his act, he was a genius in his connection with the youth. At the time, I was part of that, and I will never forget him or his Ernest. Ever.Poor, dysfunctional Ernest. He yearns to evolve from a maintenance/janitor at a summer camp to full-fledged Camp Counselor. The kids don't really respect him, the staff pities him and yet, his pure heart strives on.When the opportunity arises, he's assigned troubled kids and does all he can to lift their spirits while&#x85;running into objects, getting bit, providing poor advice and eating goo not fit for man. But, when the going gets tough, he leads the rascals against the big, bad man who wants to harvest the camp's land for profit.In all honesty, it may not be the best message to send to kids in the climax, but it's just for fun. And it is a lot of fun. Even some unintentional sexually explicit statements are made, but maybe I twisted those from my warped mind.I digress. I think this is great for young kids and adults who remember him from their childhood. And let me tell you It's refreshing to see a wooded camp movie without a killer on the loose!

Why is it so bad, because you have Ernest as the main character, plus very annoying children, and a silly subplot involving some company trying to take over the camp. I just do not think the Ernest character should be center stage for a movie. The short lived television show was the only thing this character needed as it featured other characters and such to draw some of the focus away from Ernest himself. Lets face it, the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment Vern, but more funny to see Vern get back at Ernest for bothering him in the first place. The movie here would feature a couple of the characters from the television show as cooks and they provide some comedy and Ernest has his moments. However, most of the movie is rather groan inducing and to top it off it gets overly sentimental at times as well.

I know that it will never be Howards End and it's not pretending to be either!The sad thing is that he never got to show what a great talent he had away from his Ernest character. He was also a nice gentle man behind the scenes. We miss you Jim!!

And for those of you who don't remember, consider yourself lucky, because some how they turned a 30 spot on T.V. into an hour and a half mind-numbing comedy. The film stars, Jim Varney, a somewhat (I stress somewhat) in enjoyable character with a unique ability to contort his face in strange ways (this is before Jim Carrey, kids). But that gets *real* old *real* fast. Varney is in reality a pretty decent fellow but this movie is probably something he wishes he could forget. Don't we all.

You must admit that Jim Varney, rest his soul, was a pop-cultural icon, whether you liked him or not.  I don't think the only thing this particular film of his (though it is not his best) has to offer is his facial contortions.  The writing is pretty hilarious, as long as you free your mind to it's ultimate stupidity.  Anyone who doesn't appreciate a grown man calling his pet turtle a heartless beast is missing the point.There is a fine line between stupid and clever, once said David St. Hubbins of Spinal Tap.  Sometimes genius is not appreciated until long after all the neigh-sayers are dead or gone. Remember, Citizen Kane was a flop at the box office.

Do you people think that's what makes a great movie? I grew up with Ernest(since his Sprite commercial) and have continued to watch him for over 25 years. I loved him then. I love him now. In fact, I appreciate Varney's brand of humor now more than ever. While most kids' shows today are aimed at playing down to a child's intelligence, making them feel as if they're on the bottom rung of things, the 'Ernest' movies never did that. (This movie was made in the 80's and I still think it's the smartest kids' movie out there.) Ernest never lectured a child, he never made them feel inferior. He made them feel like their opinions were just as important as his. He treated them as equals and children really gravitate toward that. I know I did. That 'children are meant to be seen and not heard' is a load of crap and it was quite obvious Ernest didn't believe in that saying. 'Ernest Goes to Camp' is just one of my favorites that I can't get enough of. Ernest is Kamp Kikakee's 'fix it' guy but dreams of becoming a Camp Councelor, but no one will give him a chance. That is until a group of Juvenile delinquents are selected to join Kamp Kikakee for the summer. Automatically, almost every counselor, especially Councelor Stennis, thinks the worst of them and treats them as such. You treat a kid like a misfit, they'll act like one. You treat a kid like they're worth something, they'll truly shine. Case in point, Stennis gets pushed into the water by the boys after he throws Moose into the lake, knowing he can't swim. No one wants to help the boys so they decide to 'dump' them onto Ernest by giving in to his wish of becoming a counselor. And that's only because they don't want to 'fool' with the boys themselves. At first, all of Ernest's attempts to get the boys interested in camping activities are met with practical jokes, stunts and a mockery of Ernest. But, being Ernest, he refuses to give up on the boys. Eventually, his perseverance pays off and the boys start believing in themselves and their abilities to do something positive with their lives. Sherman Krader of 'Krader Mining Company' wants the land(in the worst way) that Kamp Kikakee sits on to mine a fictitious mineral known as Petrocite and his greed makes him a very dishonest and hostile man. He eventually cons Ernest into talking the Chief into signing over the land, telling Ernest that it's a petition instead of a lease. Ernest and Nurse St. Cloud are the only ones that are able to communicate with the chief. After figuring out that he got taken, Ernest tries to fix it by confronting the foreman in charge of the activities of the mining company. It turns out that the foreman is a mammoth of a guy. Ernest still faces him in a fight even though he knows he won't win but feels he has to stand up for the camp and the boys. After getting beat up, all the boys, but Moose, turn on him once more. Ernest feels terrible and thinks he let down the entire camp. This is the part where Ernest sings 'Gee, I'm Glad It's Rainin''. This song is quintessential Ernest and could've been his theme song in every movie. What they wanted was a hero. All I needed was a friend. He sings it so heartbreakingly beautiful and the pain is evident in his blue eyes. After Nurse St. Cloud scolds the boys, telling them how Ernest was the only one to stand by them, they band together and convince Ernest to help them stop Krader Mining Company. Together, with the uplifting song, 'Brave Hearts', they construct contraptions and a catapult loaded down with bombs, fire arrows and 'turtle paratroopers', they blow up the equipment that Krader Mining Company had on the premises. Ernest finally gets his chance to knock out the foreman when his dozer gets hit with the cart loaded with flammable material. Krader is fed up with being stopped, so taking his rifle, he intends to shoot Ernest. Going back to the opening of the movie, Nurse St. Cloud's narrates the story of the stone, blade and arrow. No matter how good Krader's aim is, he always misses Ernest. Finally, Krader points the rifle point blank in Ernest's face, but Ernest plugs up the rifle, saying, Paper, rock, scissors, his version of the stone, blade and arrow. Krader knows he lost and makes a run for it. Krader's attorney admits that the chief was conned into signing the lease. The campers get Kamp Kikakee back and Ernest is now a year round counselor. The ending credits are great, with the song 'Brave Hearts' by Gary Chapman playing in its entirety. The words are wonderful and play into the theme of the entire movie. I recommend this movie highly if you're looking for good, honest, clean fun with a great moral message. Varney's talents are sorely missed.

Varney's self-generated character, Ernest, embodies the hapless hero, the underdog who triumphs in spite of his inadequacies, and sometimes because of them. He is not a jock, nor an intellect, nor is he particularly bright, but his heart shines above all adversity, and his honest earthiness breathes throughout his performances, even when he's being a complete idiot.I've always been One to cheer for the underdog, and when it comes to life, Ernest was the epitome of an underdog.This work tells the story of the underdog going against big business in order to save something he loves. What's more gungho American than that? In Ernest Scared Stupid, Ertha Kitt labeled him the Great Redneck Hope, and that sentiment permeates every single one of Varney's Ernest movies, and even manages to surface in his last (and ultimately BEST) film, the Beverly Hillbillies.This is my personal favorite of the line, as well as being the best.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend .

Ernest becomes a Camp counselor and tries to make camp interesting for the boys. But the boys don't like him they even pushed the soda machine back so that way it would fall on Ernest. At the beginning of the movie ther'e we're all these people dressed up like Indians. Then the boys gave Ernest poison ivy for a get well present when he has to lay down in the nurse's office. So the nurse has to give Ernest a shot. Ernest was riding a tractor around the camp site. He was also cleaning out a toilet just like a plumber. In the middle the nurse convinces the boys that ther'e lucky to have someone like Ernest around to care for them. "},{"Title":"Hey Vern, It's the First Ernest Movie! KnoWhutIMean?","Date":"18 November 2001","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Comedy","Review":"  At a summer camp, someone or someTHING is lurking around. Jason Voorhees? No. Much, much worse and far more dangerous-- Ernest P. Worrell!         That's right, Ernest pops up from his commercials and into his first movie! This film follows Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, which was a film that looked at a modern day depression. Ernest is a janitor at Kamp Kikakee, he hopes to one day be a counselor. He's fixed the camp real nice for the kids, except his cart drove away without him.           The camp is participating in a Second Chance program so they'll get kids from the state correctional facility. Ernest is chosen to go get them. The kids consist of Bobby Wayne, Crutchfield, Vargas, Danny, Chip Ozgood, and young Moose (Mustapha). On the bus ride back to camp,they cause Ernest to crash the bus and get chewed out by the guy who runs the camp, the naive Mr. Tipton.          After an accident at the lake, Counselor Stennis has a broken shin and they need someone to take his place, and to be counselor to the Second Chance boys. They need someone very determined, but not too bright. So they get Ernest. Ernest gives them lessons in outdoor survival, but turns out he's the one who needs to be taught.         Meanwhile, a strip mining company is working it's way down the line of where Kamp Kikakee is located. The man in charge, Sherman Krator, believes there's diamond mines below it but first has to get the permission of the camp's owner, Chief St. Cloud, and he doesn't speak English. Only two people know how to speak to the Chief Nurse St Cloud and Ernest, so Sherman cons Ernest into talking to chief and soon the paper is signed. Ernest now must set things right. While everyone else get's ready to leave, Ernest and his troop (The Second Chance boys) come up with a plan to get rid of the construction workers. They use everything parachuting turtles, sound effects record, and all sorts of traps. They even transform a camp bus into the ultimate battle vehicle. Chefs Eddie and Jake even use their food machine. But the evil foreman (Lyle Alzado) really bullies everyone around. He got Ernest good the last time they met, but this time Ernest really let's him have it! The camp's winning, until Sherman Krator shows up with a gun! But Ernest remembers a folk tale the Chief told him,about a Blade, Arrow, and Stone. So he outwitted Krator and the camp was saved! Ernest became a year-round counselor and the boys didn't have to go back to the Detention Center.           Summer Camp will never be the same!! This movie is pretty good. It's followed by a bunch of other Ernest films!However three cast members of this film have died. They are Lyle Alzado, Iron Eyes Cody, and Jim Varney. They will be missed. --            "},{"Title":"Ernest Goes To Crap","Date":"1 April 2003","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Comedy","Review":"  A small child with red toughskin pants sits in front of a small TV that sits on top of a larger inoperable floor model TV.

Finally she places her Waffle House hat on her head and kisses him on the cheek. I have to go to work, now Billy Boy. she says Bye mama. he says. She slams the trailor door and leaves. Hearing in the background the sound of a well used comaro's ignition struggling to turn over and then suddenly reving, he continues to laugh at Ernest Goes To Camp starring Jim Varney.I hate this movie, because much like Mike Judge's hit cartoon sitcom king of the Hill it is aimed at the redneck society and supplies jokes that only they or children could find funny.

Alot of the reviews of this movie are either by diehard Ernest fans or people who are totally against his brand of humor.  I consider myself somewhere inbetween, as this was one of my first Ernest films.  Some of Ernest's antics are entertaining, in a goofy/innocent slapstick way.  The general plot of Ernest trying to save a camp works well I suppose.The only things that ruin the movie are the supposedly criminal kids and the ending.  The juvy kids are actually 100 times more well behaved than the normal, non-criminal children! I assume the juvy kids were put in the institution for a reason! I mean they could have at least made them badasses who reform, but instead the writers made them lovable from the start, which was pretty annoying.The other glaring annoyance is the ending.  At the end of the film Ernest and the kids attack a group of Krader Construction workers with firebombs and stuff and I'm pretty damn sure they were trying to kill these guys. At least in this part the Juvy kid's true nature is exposed.  This scene is made even more over the top by the Krader boss with the hunting rifle who tries to kill Ernest but can't because of some Indian powers that protect him from bullets.  It was poorly done and ruined what was otherwise a fun little movie.Besides these painful flaws, Ernest Goes to Camp has some fun hijinks that children or viewers in the mood for something light might enjoy.  I was surprised by a pretty clever reference Ernest makes about being in the Vietnam war at one point, too bad they didn't use more of such humor.

Good 'ole Ernest B. Worrell might be a good guy - and Varney was a wonderful comedian almost all of us loved, even if just for his famous television commercials - but I didn't really care for this movie.It was mostly the obnoxious kids in here that ruined things for me. They weren't in the Midstate Boys Detention Camp for no reason they were nasty. Oh, all that is but one the black kid, of course. The white kids are all bad. Can you say political correctness? Can you save reverse racism? Sorry to see that racial nonsense in an Ernest, but there's more Liberal baloney in here, too.Football player (and no actor) Lyle Azado plays one of the bad guys. That also tells you something about the quality of this lamebrain effort.Ernest has a mission in this movie Shaping and molding youthful minds into a focused world view. Yeah, right.Still, I miss Jim Varney. "}]
