The first forty five minutes were good. It starts off in an interesting way and it's easy to become immersed in what is going on. Unfortunately the second half is poorly written. The driving force is killed off, and what follows only leads into the least anti-climatic ending ever seen. What's worse about the ending is that it fails to resolve any of the film's events. Which almost makes the entire movie a waste of a film.The directing is great, way better than this film deserves. The acting was good. I liked Jerry O'Connell's performance. Tara Reid was surprisingly convincing in displaying her emotions. Amanda Peet could have done better. Ron Livingston was great, and is shown in a somewhat different light.The film has a lot of wasted potential. I'm surprised that the last half of the script wasn't completely rewritten. It is as if the writer only planned out the first half before starting to write it. If it's a dollar rental, it may be worth it.

This movie is Swingers for its first half and then abruptly turns into The Accused for the second half, and you're left scratching your head. I was really into in for the first half, maybe because I'm a big fan of Swingers. Ron Livington's Trent (Vince Vaughn's name in Swingers, coincidentally) is flat-out hilarious, and steals the show whenever he's onscreen. There are lots of funny, insightful moments until the movie takes a deadly turn into the maudlin. An alleged rape occurs, and we see it happen from both characters' point-of-view. But since neither character is particularly sympathetic or appealing, we don't really care whose telling the truth or not. Jerry O'Connell's Michael is a mindless, jock moron while Tara Reid's Sara is a naive tease. So who cares about the outcome? And then the movie tries to throw in a few jokes during all this melodrama which really fall flat. If the movie had continued in the vein of the first half, we might have really had something here.

In `Body Shots' you get an incredibly knit-together group of Americas finest, all young actors that has yet to become too big for their own good. That is to say, they can still take on riskier projects that perhaps a bigger actor would be forced to turn down by their management because it would not `go with the audience'.My personal thanks here to Sean Patrick Flanery and Amanda Peet, whom on earlier occasions showed me that they dared (or did not get any other offers, who knows ) commit to smaller and often much more rewarding ventures.Tara Reid hasn't really impressed up till now with movies like American Pie and Urban Legends, but here she really gets a chance to act out. Usually, dramatic scenes are edited into smithereens, but all over `Body Shots' you get long, really intense sequences, with all of the cast-members showing their thespian caliber. I was also pleasantly surprised to be taken in by Chris O'Donnell's portrayal of the horny party-jock, since the last time I saw him was in the abysmal movie `Dungeons & Dragons' which kinda' put him on my black-list.Ron Livingstone is just plain weird, and therefore, marvelous. (That Alka-Seltzer-bit is going to haunt me for a while )The editing is first class. In basically all movies, when you see a club-scene, you're not convinced at all. YOU know what it feels like to be in a steamy, crowded club, surrounded by (and being) people in various stages of intoxication. It's seldom portrayed with as much realism as it was here, much thanks to the clever editing. The layout of the story as a whole is also refreshing - not saying that messing up the timeline hasn't been done before - but the cut-scenes between the girls gang and the boys gang, the constant meta-perspective of the actors relaying their personal views of the meat market, and the flashbacks helps to make this movie what it is.But what struck me most of all was the sex. I can't think about when I last saw a movie with such convincing sex-scenes. It was all the small things YOU do, but they never seem to be able to put into a movie. The sucking of fingers, the difference of intensity in kissing, the touching, the grabbing of genitalia. Now, I'm not saying that showing more always is the best way to portray sex. But when it's called for by the script and the context, then hell yes! And if you're going to attempt to make an honest movie about eight hormonally hyped twenty-something's, then most definitively so.All in all, I was very impressed. The story has been done before, but not with such pathos. Movies like these make me hopeful of the future. Perhaps we're going away from only producing predictable storylines, uninspiring actors that deliver lines like they have a nail through their kneecap and dialog that you'd never hear outside of the screenwriters head.

While Body Shots attempts to be the Swingers Sex in the 90s, it never makes it.  With a less than witty script filled with stale cliches and awkward lines, how could it?Director Michael Cristofer couldn't decide if he wanted this to be a mocumentary, with occasional testimonials by cast members commenting on their ideas about sex directly to the camera, or a drama, touching on the subject of date rape. While these characters are supposed to be the voice of twenty-somethings in the 90s, attempting to provide us with thought-provoking material, they end up instead making cliched, shallow statements that are laughable rather than interesting.  While all of us Gen-Xers are supposed to be sitting in the theater thinking, Yeah, that is so true.  That is my life., we instead sit there trying not to laugh at the cheesy dialogue and trite situations these characters are in.

No, Body Shots (1999) is NOT about the uselessness of the he said/she said accusations over drunken date rapes. Sure, that's a point worth making, but it really belongs in another movie all its own. This story, if the editor would just leave it alone, is about the inability of humans to live amongst each other with any intimacy.The characters have more sex than they appear to know what to do with, because their sex lives are still at odds with who they are, or aspire to being. All natural warmth is absent. People vaguely comment about their constant loneliness, but it doesn't bother any one of them nearly enough.Amanda Peet as Jane is much too stereotypically thin and toothy, and it's getting irritating to have that always work. Enough! Why can't she be cast as the girl who gets bedded and not called back?Women who look like her in real life are being used like tissues, by men with I.Q.s lower than the tissue. Guys just like Rick (Sean Patrick Flanery), pathetic professionals who suck at even their own jobs and who are skating on bull, but somehow in the corrupt business world they're still paid enormous paychecks that they will never, ever, deserve.So out here, not only is marriage on the way out, but so are male-female love relationships. That's what Body Shots is REALLY about. (I don't know how gay relationships are going; I can only wish them more luck.) Straight men are becoming totally lost, subhuman, autistic. Arguably abnormal. Alright, too many women are, as well. Maybe it's something in our food. Some late-onset autism cases were traced (in real life) to essentially food allergies, an inability to metabolize staple foods. Autism affects males 5 times as often as it does females, so maybe there's something to all this...The ever-so-slightly-hopeful approach towards the only really normal (nice) guy of Body Shots, Shawn Denigan (Brad Rowe) is a) ineffectual because he's stopped fighting against the offensive/criminal hosing-guy jerk, Mike (Jerry O'Connell), and b) even his possible girlfriend, Sarah (Tara Reid), is too stupid to take him for what he is a normal human being; complaining that his niceness is just too much for her! Hello! ... She even says an astoundingly stupid thing to camera And you just kinda fall into bed with them. It's safer. It's just sex, you know? -No, you idiot, Just sex is diametrically opposed to safe.This is NOT sophistication. It's naïve. Getting involved is what we're supposed to be doing! We're supposed to accept people with faults, because the real world is not a virtual play-environment; that's not reality's job. If we over-control our relationships, how will we ever learn to be fair, as opposed to a little tool fit for no-one, like Sarah?With characters this far out of whack (and it really doesn't matter what they look like, does it? They're all beautiful, unhappy, lonely idiots- I'm pretty sure that's the point), it's surprising and laughable that the healthiest relationship happens between the universally (amongst this ship of tools) disliked Trent (Ron Livingston), and the sex-goddess, Whitney (Emily Procter). When she gets kinky on him, he reacts with self-deprecating humour! I really like every bit of thesping Ron Livingston does in Body Shots. It's obvious that he's the best actor among them. The rest are playing characters that are not such a stretch. Livingston's performance is very natural and easy. I especially liked the way he talks about his chew toy. (For those who don't know, Ron's the elder Livingston; his younger brother John did some nice work the same year in The Sterling Chase (1999). Both Livingston brothers are pretty charismatic).But the best scene surely has to be the grittiest, and kudos to David McKenna for his gutsy original story, as well as Michael Cristofer for his direction. The staccato beat of drumsticks as Shawn allows pure horniness take him and his companion, Emily (Sybil Temchen), over on the bonnet of that car, is very, very effective; it's exactly how I would have done it (-the soundtrack; with the sticks, people!). Moreover, I really like that the scene happens to the supposedly shyest, most normal guy, Shawn. It gives him balance, and shows us Sarah's ridiculous underestimation of him.But why does he claim he doesn't drink when he does? Is he a recovering alcoholic? If so, why is there no mention of that? ...Plus I have to take issue with the sudden appearance of the c*nd*m.There was no time... I need to see the Director's Cut.I am sorry that Emily (Sybil Temchen) feels ripped off, denuded, used, drunk, lost, afterwards. She hadn't chosen any of it. Yet again (I realize she talks about sometimes not wanting to choose so you don't have to berate yourself for how things turn out, but she still ends up berating herself, DOESN'T SHE?). So Emily and her self-esteem are back at square one. Watch her rueful facial reaction when Shawn rushes over to Sarah's side. Despite the shared night of shame between him and Emily, he can ignore it all, because he has someone else to care for, to go to; to cleanse his guilt. She DOESN'T. So Sybil Temchen is the other great thespian.Once the date rape happens, it affects all the close friends. Specifically it suppresses the not-well-justified fledgling relationship between Jane and Rick, who are now in opposite camps. Irresponsibility leads to regret. And impotence. Note their ennui/chasm in bed.So this is a good cautionary tale. Unfortunately things are already just as bad, or worse, in the real world, and everyone is asleep at the wheel. Sleepers, wake! Resist this much self-indulgence!

One night on the town, the four men Sean Patrick Flannery (Simply Irresistible), Jerry O' Connell (The 60's), Ron Livingston (Office Space) and Brad Rowe (Stonebrook), and the four women Tara Reid (American Pie), Amanda Peet (Simply Irresistible), Emily Procter (Guinevere), and Sybil Temchen (The Passion of Ayn Rand) each pair off under different circumstances, and we are shown each of their affairs through a combination of flashbacks, testimonies, and actual footage. The film is divided up into three parts, Foreplay, Good Sex/Bad Sex and Afterplay. These subdivisions have no relevance to the plot of the movie, and seem to serve no purpose other than to make the film look trendy.Dispersed throughout the film were mini-confessions a la the Real World where each character ruminates on sex, relationships and men and women. What makes these monologues so absurd is that none of these characters are likable and therefore, their two-cents are uninspiring and completely unamusing. The acting is this film was truly horrendous. It took the cake for worst acting ever. Come to think of it, it took the whole godamn cake store.A rape scenario is introduced and most of the movie focuses on the two disputing testimonies of those involved. However the he said/she said conflicting stories are cliche and I felt as though I was watching a really bad after-school special. The movie is chock-full of cheesy camera effects such as fade-ins and fade-outs, painfully long close-ups, and unnecessary slow motion. Perhaps the director was hoping to make up for the movie's weak plot, bad dialogue, and horrendous acting with style, but no amount of gloss or tricks could have saved this film. Its two-dimensional characters, countless clichés, and obvious ending make Body Shots as unpleasant as your worst hangover.

Cristofer's sophomore project (his first was HBO's `Gia') relates the experiences of this group of twenty-somethings during a night on the town. Initially, the men and the women gather separately preparing for the evening's mating ritual. Their sexual attitudes are gradually revealed throughout the film in verbal monologues to the audience. Using raw frank language, David McKenna (screenplay) introduces us to these youths and their search for sex and/or love. In one of the few humorous scenes, one of the women tells of a course given where young ladies can learn the art of giving oral sex. The evening continues at a singles club where the guys and gals pair off as they dance, get drunk on Jell-O shots, and brawl. The limited plot revolves around the possible date rape of Sara (Tara Reid) by Michael (Jerry O'Connell), a professional athlete.  These scenes of the violent sex between this couple are shown Rashomon-like from the points-of-view of each participant.  Rodrigo Garcia has photographed these events shading with darker hues during the first part of the film, and gradually turning to brighter scenes as the following morning begins. Music is an important element in both the club scenes and later as events turn ugly and violent. The film holds up a wide screen mirror to the emptiness in their lives, and yet leaves room for the hope that there may be redemption and fulfillment in some of their futures.

What happens afterward is a matter of he says, she says.These eight singles are obsessed with sex, partying, and the ups and downs of the single life. The scattered points of view and the narrow focus of their interest leave the characters feeling rather shallow. There is way too much pontificating on every aspect of sex. It may work if this is an artsy movie about singles and sex. It's more about the rape and the conflicting recollections. The only thing that truly matters in this movie is Sara and Mike's story about what happened. There are too many characters to follow and they don't all connect with the rape. It's not focused.Then there is Tara Reid and Jerry O'Connell themselves. Tara's real life intrudes into this movie. None of these characters are likable and O'Connell is the worst of all. He plays a lot of these kinds of loud-mouthed jerks. The police interrogation is really off-putting. His character won't shut up. For some reason, the police let his friend stay and he kept trying to shut Mike up. It is hard to take such a stupid character.

What you don't count later on, is, if not watching the start, is the rapid turn the film takes. Yes our eight, twenty somethings, whatever, party like it's 1999, boozing, dancing, drug taking, and fighting. It's so 200O, this movie, which is colorfully, if deliciously entertaining and involving. Over the course of the night, things really get out of hand for two players, if instigated by a fracas with a bouncer, earlier. What ensues for O'Connell and Reid is sex gone wrong. O'Connell is charged with the rape of Reid, who back at his palatial spread, started coming onto him, and he returned his affections forcefully, against her will. But did he really rape as we have two sides to each story, as it appears Reid, her character, a wannabe actress here, has had a really bad history with booze. So really the film becomes in a lesser extent, a dramatic thriller. Who's bullshitting who. The film cleverly shows the different POV from our two, where Reid could of even made it up, where some flashbacks weren't authentic, or a little misrepresented, that's the fun in the story here. Like in Jerry Macquire, O'Connell matter of fact here, plays another big shot athlete, where only his best friend, Rick (Sean Patrick Flannery) stands by him, as really the other guys really don't know him. The dorky Trent (Ron Livingston) cracked me up, and stole the film. Besides the part where he tries to sneak back into the club, cause of his dress sense, wait to you see his hilarious flashback, later, before returning his crib, which he shares with the guy, that completes our foursome.

Swingers was a great movie with a great screenplay.  This movie has good acting but the screenwriters obviously didn't know what to do with the talent they had.  The movie is just horrible.Basically you are introduced to this group of friends but never get to know any of them enough to really give a damn about what happens to them.  There is simply no character development.  You meet the cast, they discuss how they each view sex, they go to a club, get completely drunk, have a pointless bloody street fight (which somehow is quickly recovered from), and then the film suddenly becomes a he said she said date-rape sequence which is never resolved.  In the end, you really don't care. The writer's have failed to give you any reason to.I have a feeling that someone was attempting to make a  statement on the 20 something generation -- the problem is, I don't think they talked to anyone in their 20's.All in all this movie is one big disappointment.What attracted me to go see this movie was the cast involved -- they are all great actors, but there is simply no screenplay here.

I believe that you have to be in a certain state of mind to view a film like this. It isn't something that you just pop in and kick back for. One has to be willing to accept as fact what they are seeing and base it, not on themselves, but what they have come to terms with as being routine and normal. This film is much like the birth cycle. We open with two characters, which then divides into three and finally multiplies into eight. Once all of the characters are set and ready to escape their personal pod of existence a story pushes its way through that is sometimes disgusting to watch but uncharacteristically real. We learnt that maybe Darwin was a bit off when making his theory of evolution. We see that mankind definitely formed from apes, but how much we have evolved is put into serious questioning.  Eight human beings (four males and four females) off all different size, shape and occupation emerge from everyday life for a wild night of clubbing with sex on their minds and drinks on their tabs.  The film opens with a scene of Rick and Jane lying in a bed (clothed). The opening line may simply be the best line to come from a scene like this. Upon awakening Rick asks `do you have any Tylenol baby?' Then enters Sara in a drunken state of self-loathing, bloodied at the face, telling of how she was date raped by Mike. But in the interrogation room Mike's alibi implies that it was consensual sex and Sara was freely open to receive. The first half of the film takes place in the everyday lives of our eight individual minds. It shows us the before effect (labelled here as `foreplay'), the preparation and the journey to the club. The second takes place after the alleged rape. After following the looking into the actual criminal intent of the rape the climax is unlike you would expect from a film of this nature. IT is inconclusive, insignificant even, but this is not a problem for three reasons. First, two people are so drunk that neither of them can remember the full truth of the matter so why should we? Not only should we not know who did it for the simple fact of it would become nothing more than a battle of the sexes film, but would shouldn't even care if it happened or not. Second, the whole idea of the rape is not what this film is about. It is merely a device used by Hollywood writers to show that the film is moving in a forward fashion and does have some bit of story to provide. The final reason is because this film is about a deep yearning inside that some people posses to find a common medium between unconditional sex and unconditional love. . IT is also about alcohol and how it desensitizes us and robs us of our natural ability to decipher between wrong and right. Lastly it is about consumerism. I'm sure people reading this who have already seen the film will think that I am crazy but it really is. The film is not about consumerism in story or method but in the way it is set up. The film runs much like an infomercial. All of the characters talk openly into the camera, realising its presence yet never really feeling the need to acknowledge it, grabbing you attention just long enough to sell you a little slice of their reality and maybe even set you inline with your own. But the question is how can we put such an idealistic price value on sex? Buy me a drink and I will sell you a blowjob, buy me a room and I will sell you my soul. That famous Sprite commercial says `Image is nothing, thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.' That is a great consumer statement but this film wants to counter by asking, what if it is that image you thirst for? All of these men and women have an image and it is that that draws them to each other. They all have a thirst for living like animals, being treated like animals and dying like animals, until one day they can all realise that they have drank their life away. `He hasn't tried to kiss you because he respects you, can't you handle that?' If you haven't guessed it the answer was a big, fat no. That is why these people desire alcohol so much. It is a controlling factor n their lives that feeds their image while lightening up their brain mass. I am willing to bet that for every twenty people that see this film there will be at least one who will view this as a huge waste of time. Their reasoning? That they are nothing like these characters. That in itself would be statement enough for me. For one film to make use of an external source, in this case you, is quite simply a technique we haven't seen since the release of Kids. Because we belong to the `obey your thirst generation' we are to ignorant in ourselves to admit that these people, as trashy as they are, are just like everyone else living on this planet. The ideology is that movies are made to entertain us, but when one hits a little to close to home we are first to dismiss it as unrealistic and unbelievable. Personally I marvelled in truly human these characters are. Being as this is Hollywood and everything must be formulistic the second half throws a bold curveball that sets both the idea of the alcohol controlled universe and the search for more for redemption in love are place into subtext while the idea of date rape takes over. That does not make these two issues any less important though. Alcohol is a cancer that eats away at the mind until nothing is left but the body and all decisions are left up to chance. I think the running theme of the alcohol in this film is that it's funny how people think that they are living the high life when put under its endurance yet what do you really gain from it. Is being raped a contributing factor to your idealistic dream world? What is the point in sex when you aren't even going to remember it the next mourning? Rick on the other hand, in all his drunken splendour, seems to be reaching out for help in Jane. The first scene in the bedroom is truly a great piece of description towards the films entire theme. `Did we do anything last night?' Asks Rick. After hearing the answer no his reply is `good.' `Good, why good?' Asks Jane. `Because I would hope that if we did do something that I would have remembered it.' This film could have taken a turn in the downward direction were it to pit the two groups against each other in a battle of the sexes, which I was praying would not happen in the end. For the most part it wasn't. We are allowed to examine both sides of the sexual coin from the very beginning and the account is surprisingly unbiased. The acting in this film is nothing that will stir up any talk around the table come Oscar time. All of the actors do a good job of making the characters just slimy enough to be believable and just likeable enough to hold the audience. Other than that it is nothing really less than you would expect from an underground film such as this. I must hand it to director Michael Cristofer and writer and David McKenna for the way they did this film came out. Films like this are very hard to do because they often find themselves walking the line between compelling and voyeuristic. Yet this film seems out to challenge the voyeurs of the world. Instead of analyzing the lives of a specific group of characters we seem to be analyzing ourselves, we just don't realize it because it appears in the form of a film. Probably the best film of this nature would be Kids. It thrust us into a day in the life of a group of teens bent on sex, drugs and living a free life. This film is very much like Kids, the scene in which the females are discussing the art of oral sex while getting ready for their night out seems to be taken right out of Kids. Yet it is not copyright infringement rather I felt that we are allowed to see that some people just don't know when to grow up. These people, all on the paths to mature adulthood, are still not content that they are all grown up and that my friends is a scary thought.

Written by David McKenna (`American History X') and directed by Michael Cristofer (`Original Sin'), this screenplay has potential that is dissipated by trying to make it too sexy and hip.The story starts with Sara (Tara Reid) coming to a friend's house in the middle of the night in her nightgown with face bloodied, claiming to have been raped by her date.  We then shift to the events that preceded the alleged attack, as we meet our eight yuppies whose raging hormones are searching desperately for release by means of drunken stupefaction. Interspersed, we receive asides from each of the characters giving their honest and somewhat immature views on sex and relationships.  This part of the film is utterly vapid and self indulgent, full of gratuitous sex and nudity, seemingly just to impress us with how shallow and hedonistic these young people are.After a night of wild and lascivious dancing, everyone gets blotto and hooks up with someone for meaningless flesh pounding.  Sara, who has been involved all night in dancing that can only be described as coital pantomime with pro football player Mike Penorisi (Jerry O'Connell), decides to take him home in a taxi after he finishes beating up a guy who bumped into him in the bar.Fast forward to the present and each participant gives a flashback description of the events, Sara describing being forcibly raped despite her protestations, and Mike describing an nymphomaniac using him to get revenge on her ex-boyfriend and who became infuriated when he called her by the wrong name.  The evidence supports both views, with Sara's behavior before the incident clearly provocative and slutty, and her emotional and physical state afterward extremely sincere and convincing.  The picture is further clouded by the fact that both were extremely drunk and the reliability of their statements is questionable.The rape storyline is fertile ground for an excellent drama, but Cristofer draws away abruptly just when the story gets interesting and returns to soliloquies of the various characters giving their reflections on the events that just occurred.  The film thus leaves the viewer extremely unsatisfied with the outcome.Ultimately, the film seems to be trying to make the point that this event was inevitable given the dangerous and irresponsible behavior of the characters.  Cristofer tries to infuse the story with the moral that loving relationships are better than promiscuous drunken encounters, but his final scenes are too abstruse to make the argument with any power.This is a good showcase for some young talent.  Most impressive is Tara Reid, best known as Vicki in `American Pie'.  Reid gives a gut wrenching performance, sexy when she needs to be and utterly devastated after the incident.  Sean Patrick Flannery is also good as the nice guy who feels that he has to act like a sex obsessed jerk to fit in with his friends.  He has a couple scenes with Amanda Peet that are heartfelt and touching.  Peet gives a surprisingly good dramatic performance that is a far cry from the ditzy parts for which she is getting known lately.  Jerry O'Connell does well as the jock with the untamed libido.  Ron Livingston is outrageously abrasive and droll as Trent, the obnoxious dweeb with an overblown sense of self importance.This could have been a good film, but it takes the wrong approach to a serious contemporary subject.  I rated it a 6/10.  While the moral of the story is constructive, the presentation overemphasizes the very behavior it is criticizing, and neglects the true human interest story by skirting the serious issue.  Some respectable acting performances, especially by Tara Reid, are reduced by the film's superficiality.

Four guys and four girls set off on a wild ride through L.A.'s nightlife, dressed to kill and ready to party hard. And as the drinking, dancing and sexual tension intensifies the night gets out control and ultimately changes everyone, forever.It's 'Melrose Place' meets Sex and the City' when Sean Patrick Flanery, jerry O'Connell, Amanda Peet, Brad Rowe, Tara Reid, Ron Livingston, Emil Proctor and Sybil Temchen star in the sexy and provocative Body Shots.Considering the rating of body shots, it has sent home a message to me I will take to the grave. You must see this movie. I have seen plenty of teenage based films, more than any other genre lately, this film is in its unique way a pleasant change. Yet, the cast make me feel right at home because of previous teen flicks they have appeared in.I thought the cast blended perfectly. The character I knew immediately was Sara, played by Tara Reid. I loved her in American Pie and Urban Legend. In this flick her character was one I felt for. Then there was Jerry O'Connell who played footballer and tough guy Michael. I enjoyed his role in the 2nd instalment of the scream trilogy as the boyfriend of stalker victim, Sydney Prescott. Again his role in this one was someone who I felt sorry for even though the situation was probably his fault as much as anyone's. Amanda Peet is also another character that has recently hit the big and small screen. Her role of Jane was one of compassion and sensibility. She doesn't rush into things, which in today's world is very important. Amanda also stared in the funny film the Whole Nine Yards, alongside Hollywood legend Bruce Willis, a film I loved. She also stars in the TV series called Jack and Jill. Her character's name in the series is Jacqueline 'Jack' Barrett. I look forward to seeing her in more movies.Each character in Body Shots gives their view on the main topic that we all grapple with in life - Sex. The men from the guys point of view and the women from the girl's point of view. They talk about everything and anything, and boast about every sexual experience they have had. Here is where this gets like one of my favourite TV shows, and a lot of other people's as well - Sex and the City. Body Shots has that feel to it in my opinion and I enjoyed the way the message was delivered. They're some scenes that relate to this topic which made me laugh and also sit up and take notice.Then the film moves onto the night on the town, which for me showed how vulnerable people can let themselves go. In fact some characters say that losing or not being control is the best way to be. But in my opinion, the film shows that doing this is leaving yourself open for to many unknowns to happen. I have no problem with people having a good time, but don't let it ruin the rest of your life.In the end this film for me has taught one thing. What makes a relationship is love and companionship, not sex. Sex completes it by making LOVE. To finish, the summary by the cosmopolitan magazine sums this one up for me.'A sexy and sinful look at being single in the new millennium. Body Shots hits it dead on'. I agree. Being single isn't such a hassle or shouldn't be a problem, it's how you handle being single and the risks you take to avoid being the odd one out.

In the last decade, stalking, safe sex, and sexual harassment have been media-savvy topics for debate, and after watching this film, one would expect what dating is like these days.  The days of the womanizer, like James Bond, Shaft, or Austin Powers might belong in another genre, where the young urban professional has taken the place of the former.  It's hard to be the player, and the womanizer, however, the 4 couples experience their own version of how their date turned out.  One was shocking, with the issue of date rape, while the others (the fellatio in the parking lot, and the dominatrix) might be leaned toward sexual inneundo.  The only dating experience that has a lot of latitude was the one between Sean Patrick Flanery (a native East Fort Bend County native, like myself) and Amanda Peet.  They should have casted Ryan Phillippe and Angelina Jolie for the couple that ended up with their version of how alcohol abuse leads to date rape.  The character of Jane was suited for Amanda Peet, since what I have seen was emotional, especially with the scenes where she and Tara Reid are together (with the Bond girl and her friend), outlining the legal system and the overall outcome of rape/sexual assault in a court of law.  Not every rape case is prosecuted, because one must look at the facts, and apply an attribution of one's behavior when a jury has to fit the puzzle together.

Then, it's up to you to reach a conclusion. There are many clichés as you may expect in a movie that portrays a life style.

I think Body Shots is one of those films.  This is a film that takes a very frank stand about sex and dating rituals not just in the 90's but ( in my opinion ) of all time.  Sex is almost a necessity in many people's lives.  You may not die without it but some people do change when they are getting it or not getting it.  Body Shots does a very good job of showing the compulsions of sexually active people, some of the strange fetishes that other people have, how sex with love will always be better than sex without it and it also shows that sex is not a bad thing the way it is portrayed in society, even if it is between two people that are just using each other to get off.  This is a very honest film in the way that it speaks and the way it listens.  Not everyone is like these characters, but I'm willing to bet that there are a lot more that are like them than what people realize or want to admit they realize.  I am not talking about the  he said she said rape take in the film, but the talk and exploration into sexual practises is interesting, funny, shocking and fun to watch all at once.There are a few true strengths to the film.  First, it has to be said the cast is great.  There are so many young bright faces in here and they shine with this controversial subject matter.  I could go on and name all eight of the characters and the people that play them and give each of them equal praise but that would almost be redundant and may bore you, so what I will do is tell you some of my favourite performances in the film.  First is Amanda Peel and Sean Michael Flannery.  They play Jane and Rick respectively.  Both are very attractive people ( physically and intellectually ) and they seem to be the ones that carry the film.  They seem to be the ones that are most serious about starting a relationship. And they like each other, so that sets up the love interest.  But then the alleged rape takes place between two of their friends and suddenly what looks to be a sure love connection is jeopardized.  But instead of doing what all films do when they make the two meet, like each other, break up and then get back together, the film is more intelligent than that.  First of all they never really consumated their relationship so they can't really break up, but what they do is realize that what they could have may be special and that no matter the circumstances it may be worth a chance to get together.  They play these roles with care and compassion for their characters and I really liked them in this film.Tara Reid is a great new actress on the scene as she was one of the bright spots in the abyssmally awful Urban Legend and she was terrific in American Pie.  Here she is not a very likable person but she plays it so well.  I also want to mention Ron Livingstone from Office Space.  He cracks me up. And Emily Procter as Whitney.  Not only is she beautiful but she can act and she does an admirable job in here with a difficult role.  But she handles it with class, dignity and humour.  If you watch this film, it is her character that is the most secretive of all of them, but she is also one of best parts of the film.  I see her going on to be big in Hollywood.What is also good about the film is the dialogue.  It has a good ear and knows how some people talk.  I was laughing in all the right places and somber and intrigued when I was supposed to be.  Jerry O'Connell has a very powerful and eye opening speech when he is confronted with what he is up against.Body Shots is not afraid to talk openly and crudely about sex and all that encompasses it.  Everything from blowjobs to cunnilingus to raunchy sex to making love, it is all in here.  I admire the film for being something different.  This is not a typical entry into the raunchy sex genre.  It is raunchy but it is well done and that is what separates it from the rest of the pack.  It will not be around long at the theater so if you get a chance, you should take a chance and see this film.  I enjoyed what it had to say, and how they said it.  You may not agree with what it has to say, but you may also be entertained and feel a smile creep along your face as you disagree with it.  Not many films can make you do that.

They're white, they're youngish, they're pretty, and--to borrow a great man's phrase--they're pretty vacant. BODY SHOTS is a dissection of their mating and mismating rituals. The fact that the octet of neo-yupsters collected by the screenwriter David McKenna are all thoroughly repulsive would be no problema if this were a film by Neil LaBute. However, the aspirations here are more toward a lifestyle article in Marie Claire embellished to feature length.To be curt, the shtik here is date rape Rashomon-style; or, to borrow from the Kevin Bacon canon, he-said-she-said. The problem that a) you don't buy one of the participants' story and b) you couldn't care less seems not to have fazed the director, Michael Cristofer, who stages a hotsy-totsy encounter against a chain-link fence just as he did in his leery TV movie GIA. Cristofer, the author of the ghastly seventies play THE SHADOW BOX, seems to be building a career in his late middle age on serving up succulent young flesh, but the focus here is on dialogue meant to stir up conversation on the drive home.

This film attempts to be a raunchier Swingers for sex and the club scene and fails miserably at doing so.As a funny take on the single life the movie might have put up a fighting chance but in repeatedly trying to be taken seriously the movie falls flat on its face. The entire package is worse than most adult movies I've seen and many instances I found my self wondering if that was what I was actually watching.The basic premise (seriously) is as follows Characters hang out together, go clubbing and have sex.The characters make comments in ramblingly nonsensical summations to the audience throughout the film in an attempt to dispel their ridiculously oversexed take on the meaning of life and then suddenly and without reason we become trapped in an after school special on date rape.A cast including such up and comers as Tara Reid (American Pie) and Ron Brewington (Swingers and Office Space) could have provided redemption and though the acting was stellar throughout it was unbelievably wasted as no actor no matter how talented could have saved this story.There is no comparison between Swingers or Go and Body Shots. The former represents film-making at it's best while the latter film-making at it's absolute worst.Overall Rating F (a generous offer) "},{"Title":"Fairly mediocre, but entertaining","Date":"11 February 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Body Shots is meant to be equal parts a Mars vs. Venus study of young adult sexuality, and a cautionary tale about the hardcore-clubbing/sex-with-random-strangers lifestyle. Unfortunately, this film fails to get either point across convincingly. The movie actually stars off pretty entertainingly, establishing the friendships among the male and female protagonists who will later meet up with one another for some late-night shenanigans. Especially engaging are the short vignettes in which the characters give us an inside glimpse into their personal thoughts on dating, love, and sex. But this tongue-in-cheek, introspective tone gets lost somewhere around the middle of the movie, when the plot suddenly shifts gears and turns into a Lifetime-movie-of-the-week look at acquaintance rape and its link to overindulging in alcohol and/or drugs. Sadly, this half of the movie fails to satisfy as well, since it leaves things very much up-in-the-air at the end.On the talent side, the cast and acting were OK, if not Oscar-worthy. I was able to buy Tara Reid's portrayal of a rape victim, which was a pleasant surprise. However, Amanda Peet seemed to be just going through the motions, for some reason.Unfortunately, two of the film's most intriguing characters -- Trent (Ron Livingston) and Whitney (Emily Procter) -- are also its most under-utilized. You get the sense that there's a lot going on beneath Trent's smarmy, devil-may-care exterior, but unfortunately, the film barely scratches the surface of his character. Similarly, I found myself wanting to explore the reasons why Whitney is perfectly happy to engage in the kinkiest sex acts with a man she barely knows, but the thought of him spending the entire night, or, worse yet, the prospect of falling in love, absolutely terrify her. Procter does a pitch-perfect job of giving viewers just enough of a glimpse into the pain behind the perky smile to leave us wanting more. Towards the end of the movie, it looks like we may not have seen the last of Trent & Whitney, but, true to form, the movie leaves us hanging there, too.All in all, Body Shots is definitely worth seeing if you can find the DVD in one of those retail bargain bins, like I did; or if you're looking for a fairly entertaining way to pass the time on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Otherwise, much better movies have been made on the subject matter.

Rick (the gorgeous Sean Patrick Flanery) is an attorney who could have everything he wants, only he is not sure what he wants. One thing is for sure, he is lonely. If you fall in love with everyone you #@!%, you would not be this lonely. He is about to embark on a new relationship with a legal clerk named Jane (probably one of the underused Amanda Peet's best performances). Rick's friend Sean (the equally gorgeous Brad Rowe) is a nicely dressed yuppie, almost old fashioned in his chivalry.Like Rick, Sean is unsure of who he is or what he wants. I found Sean to be the most interesting of the males. He tries to project a certain image or personality, but he has so many secrets that he seems uncomfortable with himself. He even has a dark side, and is very uncomfortable with that as well. During this fateful night on the town with his friends, he has sex with one of the girls, Emma (an actress I've always enjoyed, Sybil Temchen, who looks just a tad like Mira Sorvino), but even though it's no doubt a pleasurable (a long, graphic but not gratuitous 10 min. scene) experience, both parties immediately regret doing this and part company. Their sex was influenced by sudden loneliness and alcohol, and the next day, Emma examines her habit of drinking too much and carrying around a wine bottle rather than just a glass.Her friend Whitney (one of my idols, Emily Procter) is a silicone enhanced but very warm and caring blonde who works as a cocktail waitress at the club they frequent. Whitney was probably the most interesting of the females. She, like the character Callie Dusquense of CSI Miami, is a very strong and confident personality who actually DOES seem to know what she wants. Almost male in her viewpoints, she doesn't want every guy she brings home to be attaching himself emotionally to her. She doesn't want to wake up and find that some guy she only wanted sex from is making himself comfortable in her house, talking about commitment, or eating my cereal. An adventurous woman, she hooks up with the male most like herself, Trent (a hilarious Ron Livingston, who actually became more gorgeous after these mid-late 90s films). Trent is another character who is pretty blunt about what he's looking for. It's not a wedding band. Whitney and Trent are probably the only 2 characters who truly enjoyed the night, because neither of them are really looking for love.The 2 who end up absolutely NOT enjoying their night are Michael (yes, he's gorgeous as well Jerry O'Connell), a pro football star and Sara (Tara Reid, an actress I liked in all these 90s movies...before she turned into a tabloid. Honey, seriously, why did you think you needed implants???!!!) After dancing naughtily all night and having a violent brawl with the henchman of some actor, the 2 end up in Sara's apartment, and suddenly there are serious accusations of rape flying around.The search for the truth leads to an inevitable battle of the sexes. It's impossible to tell which party is the liar. The truth about these people's unhappiness and emptiness is revealed, and the strength of friendship is put to a hard test.The end is ambiguous, which is realistic. It's hard to say what the moral of the story is, except that it is a lonely world, and in their quest to find whatever they are looking for, love, commitment, fun, companionship or just hot sex, often times the search can end in disappointment, regret and even more loneliness. In the case of Michael and Sara, it was hatred, or perhaps it was morning-after regret. In the case of Sean and Emma, it was self-loathing and regret. In the case of Trent and Whitney, it was good fun and nothing more. In the case of Rick and Jane, well, that was especially sad. They seemed to click and match very well, and things looked promising, but the terrible event involving Michael and Sara ultimately drove a wedge between them.This isn't everyone's favorite kind of film, but it is mine because it really made me have to think about each character and each motive. I'd give it an A+.

It does not try to be too clever though, some of the characters are unsavoury but the cast are all young, fresh faced Hollywood stars, not the big names though. It revolves around two groups of friends, men and women who discuss things like the first date, sex, and what they want in an partner. They meet on a night out and most end up sleeping with each other. However, the next day one of the women accuses one of the men of rape. We then see how each character rally's around their friends, how the men are pushed away at times, how each group can mistrust each other, and how the cops try to work it all out. Jerry O Connell stars as Michael, a Jock accused by Sara. We are then shown in flashback both sides of the story. Sara says she was raped, but has a history of going with the wrong type of guy and being sexually forward. Michael says it was not rape, and that she consented. As there is no real proof we have to make up our own minds, leaving us to think about the state of modern relationships. However, there is comedy in the film, and all the performances are good, particularly from Emily Procor whose part is small. The dialogue is good with some funny lines, and the discussion between friends about sex is both funny and honest and will please both sexes.7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Tara Reid's Goods","Date":"25 December 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This movie isn't that bad to be honest.

This project is commonly known as Body Shots. This movie brings together Hollywood's most dynamic young stars and starlets and caters to the educated crowd with a sexy punch. On the surface, this movie appears to chronicle a night out on the town with a group of young, sexy singles. In reality, Cristofer has succeeded in delivering to the public a modern day accounting of The Four Ages poem by the classical poet Ovid. For those of you unfamiliar, Ovid is actually short for Publius Ovidius Naso, a poet born shortly after the death of Julius Caesar and raised in the fertile hills about 90 miles east of Rome. This fact brings an eery similarity to the modern day fertile hills of California.    The movie takes viewers through four distinct ages...standin around, clubbin, sexin' it up, and stuff. Each of these ages are directly connected to the four ages of Ovid's poem The Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze age and the Iron Age. To best illustrate this, I shall use some quotes from an original 1954 translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses. The Golden Age ...a time that cherished of its own will, justice and right; no law. fearfulness was quite unknown, and the bronze tablets held no legal threatening... When you see the movie, it is clear to see how this relates directly to the plot. The Silver Age Jove made the springtime shorter...(I will give this one to you - this passage refers to the wait in the club line being much shorter than usual, due to the powerful connections one of the babes has with the doorman) The woodland thickets, and the bark-bound shelters no longer served; and the seeds of grain were planted in the long furrows. The Age of Bronze ...agressive instincts, quick to arm, yet not entirely evil. Notice how this very concise wording fits exactly with the plot of the movie. Agressive sexual instincts, not entirely bad. I will leave the examples from the Iron Age out, as I want all of you to experience first hand the beauty of this film. 10 out of 10 for the babe factor, 9 out of 10 for the film.
