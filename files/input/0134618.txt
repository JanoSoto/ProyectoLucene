[{"Title":"It's More Than A Hockey Game","Date":"15 August 2000","Score":"36 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  	It's cold in the small hamlet of Mystery, Alaska, but there's plenty of warmth in `Mystery, Alaska,' the film, directed by Jay Roach, about the town and the sport that is ingrained in the collective consciousness of the community.  Hockey is the game, and when a former resident, now a journalist, writes a story about Mystery's home-town team and their `Saturday Game,' and it ends up as a three page spread complete with pictures in Sports Illustrated, it has far reaching effects on the populace of this small dot on the map.  Soon the town is turned upside down, embroiled in an event, the proportions of which, to them, are huge.  Needless to say, it involves hockey and an encounter with a high-profile professional team.  Yes, there is a lot of hockey in this movie, but be advised, this film is not `about' hockey; this is a movie about people&#150; real people&#150; and what makes them tick.   	Roach has crafted a thoroughly entertaining and emotional story of want and need, dignity and desire, obsession and love, and he's captured it all through the winning performances of a stellar ensemble cast, the most prominent of which is Russell Crowe.  The charismatic Crowe, finally on his way to superstardom thanks to his turn in `Gladiator' plays John Biebe, Mystery's sheriff and captain of the hockey team.  His rugged good looks and persona fit the character perfectly, and he puts all of his myriad personal resources to work to put it across, and that he does.  Also notable is the personable Mary McCormack as John's wife, Donna, who does a great job of fleshing out the character of this woman who made what she deems to be the right choices in her life, without regrets or apologies to herself or anyone else.  It's a refreshing portrayal, and the chemistry between her and Crowe is unmistakable.  Also adding to the overall texture of this film are Hank Azaria, as Charles Danner, the journalist who gets the whole thing rolling; Burt Reynolds, as Judge Walter Burns, a man forced to deal with his own personal issues, which include a son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), a member of the hockey team; Colm Meany, as Scott Pitcher, Mayor of Mystery, and Lolita Davidovich as his wife, Mary Jane; Maury Chaykin, as Bailey Pruitt, the man who seems to personify the very essence of Mystery's spirit; and Ron Eldard as `Skank,' another member of the team who's good for two things&#150;suffice to say that hockey is one of them. 	Mercifully, `Mystery, Alaska' never pursues the beat-the-dead-horse cliched mentality that sports `teaches one to be a team player and builds character.'  Instead, Roach has given us a worthwhile, memorable movie with a human touch, and because of that, in the end these are people you care about, as individuals as well as a community.  The climactic game is exciting and far from predictable, beginning with the celebrity they bring in to sing the National Anthem.  This may not be one of Russell Crowe's biggest or highest profile movies, but this is one he's going to be able to look back upon with pride, because it's right up there with his best.  Remember, you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this movie; all that's required is that you have a membership in the club know as Mankind.  I rate this one 9/10.

In the best ensemble film fashion a truly eclectic cast forms the very core of the story that is Mystery, Alaska. Hank Azaria turns in a spectacular performance as the ugly duckling &#150; a character not too popular who escaped the town for fame and fortune in television sports. He garners the small town some big time noteriety when the announces that the New York Rangers will challenge a game against the locals pond hockey team. Typical small town chaos ensues as all prepare for the big event.Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Mary McCormack all turn in fine performances contributing nicely to the oddities inherent in any small town. While the story can seem a bit forced formulaic, David Kelly's script and Jay Roach's directing bring a freshness and satisfaction that made this one of 1999's best sleepers. A most watchable feel good movie.

That a film so seemingly inconsequential pays such care and attention to its characters is to its utmost credit. Before viewing I mistakenly assumed this was a gig Crowe took only because he needed the career-boost. How wrong I was!We've all essentially seen this before in one form or another; underdogs band together to reaffirm pride for their history and heritage, all thanks to the great leveller we've come to know as 'sports'. Sure, all the expected clich√©s are present, and I did get a little annoyed at just how MUCH hockey was in the last segment, considering I'd previously been enjoying the character details too much to really care about the event that unifies them - but it's the rich characterisation that prompts many a smile, delighted laugh and one or two moments of poignancy. It's 'fuzzy' - and I guess perhaps manipulative - without being sickening, and that must come down to Kelley's background in the world of populist TV. There are enough sharp lines to offset the sentiment, so you don't tend to bristle when it's there!Jay Roach really impressed me with this one, as it proves that he's more than 'adept' enough to handle a little pathos, too; a branch of comedy I somehow don't see the Austin Powers franchise extending toward... ! Although the final game is a bit 'dull' from my perspective, the hockey training scenes are inventively shot; keeping the speed and fluency of a viscerally exciting spectacle. Burt Reynolds again excels after Boogie Nights, with a completely different performance this time - 'quiet dignity' instead of brash smarm.Really it's unfair to single out, though, from such a fantastic ensemble. It's the sense of togetherness and perfect encapsulation of small-town spirit that makes this work, and if you're searching for a movie to lift your gloom then it's no 'Mystery' where you should look Alaska... ! 9/10.

Russell Crowe is not just an ill-mannered detective from Los Angeles, or a Gladiator from ancient Rome; no, in Mystery, Alaska, he showed that he indeed has a nurturing, almost lovable side to him.   Mystery is a small, quiet town located smack dab in the middle of Alaska.  It is a town where hockey is the most important thing in their lives.  There are special Saturday Games where the town's Mayor, and two other board members select a few townsfolk to play against each other for the enjoyment of the other townspeople.   When an article about this town and their hockey playing is published in Sports Illustrated, The NHL decides that the N.Y. Rangers would play an exhibition game in Mystery, Alaska for a little publicity. Throughout this movie, the people of Mystery band together and eventually play their game against the Rangers.... This movie is well worth the $3.79 to rent, if you weren't one of the lucky ones to see it in the theater.  As much as I enjoyed this movie, there was one scene which was a little reminiscent of Varsity Blues.  The acting is wonderful, and I think that everyone that gives this movie a chance will appreciate the great story.

Russell Crowe leads all-star cast that included Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin and Burt Reynolds in Mystery, Alaska. Full of hope, pride and determination, Mystery, Alaska will capture the hearts of the audience. A 13-year tradition in Mystery where everybody comes together to participate in the Saturday game, a hockey game played every Saturday, draws the interest of the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers.Azaria comes to propose this challenge to the townspeople of Mystery. After some debate at a town meeting, the mayor accepts the challenge to play the New York Rangers; the players must put their personal feelings aside to win the game. This game between the team from Mystery and the Rangers becomes a David and Goliath match-up, which ultimately comes down to which team can outduel the other first. Can the team from Mystery rise to the challenge given by the New York Rangers? Crowe is an actor that has brought integrity to his roles such as Officer Bud White in L.A. Confidential. Crowe, who received critical praise as Bud White, brought the same amount of integrity to Mystery, Alaska, as soft-spoken Sheriff John Biebe. Burt Reynolds, who has starred in Boogie Nights and received an Oscar nomination for his role as Jack Horner, portrayed hard-nosed Judge Walter Burns in Mystery Alaska. Reynolds role as Judge Burns turned out to be very impressive since it seemed that he took his time and enjoyed portraying the small town judge/coach from Mystery.Co-writers David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne as well as director Jay Roach work in conjunction to make one of the best films in 1999. Kelley, who has enjoyed success as producer of The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope, L.A. Law and Picket Fences, has brought originality to the film. This film allows the audience to sit back, relax and focus on putting themselves in the movie. Mystery, Alaska is a highly recommended film that should be seen by everybody because it was performed by a talented cast, well-put together by the writers and director, has a great plot, and noteworthy performances by the actors.  "},{"Title":"Very well done","Date":"25 October 2005","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":" This movie is easy to bash because of its underdog formula, but this is one of the better spins I've ever seen put on it.Mystery, Alaska is a small, ice-covered town that no one would ever have heard of were it not for former resident Charles Danner's (Hank Azaria) article on the Saturday game of hockey that has become a ritual in the town. Danner sings the town's hockey praises, likening their skating ability to that of any team in the NHL, and the gods of fiction hear the call, arranging for an exhibition game between the New York Rangers and the Mystery players. This sets off storms of conflict and multiple subplots which give this film a depth normally not found in the genre. The hockey game itself is almost an afterthought, because while the players know how to play the game, they don't have the same mastery over their daily lives.John Biebe (Russell Crowe) is the town sheriff and involuntarily-retired player from the Saturday game who is called upon to return to the team as their coach and as a player. His wife, Donna (Mary McCormack), is proud of the life she has built and slightly wistful about what the rest of the world would have held for her, but is content with what she has and does not live with her head in the clouds. Burt Reynolds is excellent as town judge Walter Burns, who must grapple with his teenage children, one of each gender, with the boy lacking the ambition Walter has for him, and the girl being a little too ambitious for his taste with her boyfriend. Colm Meany is the town Mayor who must deal with marital conflicts, and the remaining characters are what you'd expect to find in a closely-knit small town.The game itself is more like something out of The Air Up There than any of the movies mentioned in the other reviews. In that movie, the Africans played basketball for much the same reason as the Mystery boys play hockey, and as in that movie, the talent pool from the area is rich enough for the pros to take more than a passing look at the players (two of the Mystery players wind up signing with the Rangers and playing for their minor-league outfit in Binghamton).The players' main worry is that they'll get blown out by the Rangers, and shatter their illusions about their talent, but since the game is held on their pond, where they believe nobody beats them, they weren't about to back down. The Rangers, at first reluctant opponents who would rather have had some time with their families, get an early wake-up call in the game that causes them to remember why they played hockey in the first place, and take the game as seriously as a Stanley Cup final from then on. It is then that we see that while the Mystery players may lack the polish of the NHL, they are hardly outclassed.As expected, the Zamboni makes a cameo, as does Mike Myers as a former player/announcer. The movie has the usual small-town hostility towards outsiders, including some ribald swipes at a female TV reporter, but throughout the movie, we see what makes this town tick, and how their commitment to hockey is one that every professional player should never lose. Sports may be a business, but in the end, the play is the thing, and this movie makes that point better than many of the better-known films that try to drive home the same point.

Jay Roach also comes into his first real film that is not a parody (he directed the 2 Austin Powers flicks).  Plot involves Azaria, who is a Sports Illustration writer who can (and will) bring the New York Rangers to the small (yet powerfull) hockey team in the community of cold Mystery, Alaska.  Great character development provided by writer David E. Kelly (who makes a jump from Lake Placid and Ally McBeal).

Therefore, I avoided watching it. After a couple of years it was on TV and I didn't have anything better to do at the moment, so I sat down and watched it. After seeing it, I was sold!!!! Wat a great and fun movie to watch. I spent the next 2 years looking for it on DVD. Thank god, movies are much easier to find in the US. During my internship here I finally found it.The movie is about a small Alaskan town where hockey is the way of living. The local team consists out of a bunch of talented but crazy characters. However the team and the rest of the small town get very serious when a publicity stunt takes place and the local team gets the chance to play an exhibition game against NHL team, New York Rangers. To give the movie a more serious impact, there are also some more serious things going around some of the teammates and other residents. A team captain who doesn't feel appreciated but the mayor. A hockey player who realizes that having sex with to many people has consequences, The wife of the mayor has a secret that her husband ultimately finds out and the friendly assistant of the mayor, who stands up to the people who make fun of his 'Lumberjack' town. The humor combined with the dramatic tint makes this movie excellent for the whole family. Fans of hockey and humor will definitely have a good time watching this. I've learned now that a poster doesn't mean anything. I missed out on a great movie for a long time because of thinking like that. Never again!!!9 out of 10 for this one. Fun fun movie!!!

During the long cold winter, the residents look forward to the Saturday games played by the hockey team described by Sports Illustrated as being good enough for the NHL, even though they never play any teams from outside the area.Sheriff Biebe is a veteran player who is not as good as he used to be, and he must step aside to make way for younger men such as Stevie.Charlie left town years ago hoping for a more exciting life. He returns periodically, and this time he has come back with the announcement the Mystery team will play the New York Rangers. Actually, the Rangers are not too happy about coming to this frozen wasteland, especially since they would like to have time off.Not all in Mystery are enthusiastic about the idea, fearing the town will be embarrassed. Judge Burns is one of those opposed, and he refuses to be the coach for this game, giving Sheriff Biebe an opportunity to return to the sport. The dispute goes to court, and attorney Bailey Pruitt is sent to argue the town's case. His passion for his town has unfortunate results, but what happens may ultimately have helped the town win. The Rangers will play in Mystery after all.Meanwhile, the town is fighting efforts by a chain store represented by Mr. Walsh, whose treatment leads him to conclude these are a bunch of crazy Eskimo Rednecks. Those who say Eskimo are reminded the preferred term is Inuit. Actually, most of the people in Mystery are Caucasian.Judge Burns is overprotective of his cute daughter Marla who wants to make sure her boyfriend Stevie doesn't leave her for a girl who will. (Will what? You know what.) The judge's son Birdie can't seem to please his father.Charlie used to date Donna, who married Sheriff Biebe and had 3 kids with him. But there seems to be little threat Donna will go back to Charlie, even though she is not entirely happy in this place.At first, this seemed silly. Only Russell Crowe seemed to be rising above the material, and his ended up being the standout performance. Later I realized this was like Northern Exposure in more ways than one--sure, there were quirky characters, but also good writing and acting.I don't know hockey, but the game seemed exciting enough.This would have been a good family movie if the writers had stayed away from bad language and other inappropriate content. Even cleaned up, it was raunchier than it had to be.******* Even if you want spoilers you may not want this one ********This movie does have a happy ending, but not a Hollywood happy ending. It takes a lot more effort to make the ending enjoyable when the team comes close to, but does not achieve, the final goal the formula would seem to dictate.But the Mystery team does gain the respect of their opponents, and the townspeople really appreciate their effort.******* Okay, you can start reading again *******I enjoyed the second half more than the first. The fact is Northern Exposure did not always please me either.

I like ice hockey and I even played it a little in college, but that alone was not enough to hold my interest in this film.I rented it thinking that it was supposed to be a dramatic comedy, but the jokes were so few and far between (and even then, few of the jokes were funny) that I soon realized that it was no comedy.  I also didn't find it very dramatic - you can't really identify with the characters, there are too many players and too little time.I didn't even make the connection between this film and Rocky until reading another user's review just now.  The difference is that in Rocky, you follow the life of a single man very closely, you really get into the fact that he is poor, lives in the slums of New York, a real underdog who suddenly has a shot, and from the beginning he pours his entire life into his chance to be recognized, to rise up as a true underdog.But in Mystery, Alaska, you don't really get that feeling of the underdog that rises from the top against seemingly impossible odds.  They try to make an entire town into an underdog, and it's just hard to identify with that. After getting a deal dropped in its lap, the town ends up acting like a bunch of bickering stooges, and then at the end they play a hockey game against the New York Rangers.  By the time they got to the game, I didn't even care if they won or lost.Another major difference is that Rocky Balboa was likeable; during the film you really get to know him and realize that he's a good man living a rough life.  In contrast, most of the people in the town of Mystery acted like a bunch of jerks, I really didn't like any of them.  I could feel some empathy when I saw Rocky, but I didn't give a crap about any of these Mystery hockey players.The only positive thing that I can say about the film is that the acting was good.  But that's not enough to make a good movie.  Mystery, Alaska is nothing more than a boring waste of good acting talent. "},{"Title":"Not great, but believable.

It is the equal of neither, but nonetheless emerges as a somewhat funny and somewhat touching film.  The hook is hockey.  Fans of the frozen sport are more likely to give Mystery, Alaska a chance.  Hockey purists might actually rate this movie ahead of Slap Shot because there is more of a focus on the skills needed to play the game.  The average movie-goer will prefer Slap Shot for its sheer entertainment value and the star power of Paul Newman. Mystery, Alaska tells a better story and also presents a more realistic view of the sport of ice hockey, but Slap Shot wins the overall comparison because of its madcap depiction of life in the minor leagues, including the memorable characters of the violent, bespectacled Hanson brothers.  Along with its subdued treatment of hockey, Mystery, Alaska provides a glimpse of life in a small town where ice and snow are the norm.  It doesn't stack up to Northern Exposure in that regard, but Mystery has its share of oddball characters, in particular Skank Marden (Ron Eldard) the town Romeo, just enough to keep things interesting.  Russell Crowe stars as John Biebe, an over the hill hockey player.  He is showing that he has more dimension than a mere action star, as displayed not only here, but also in L.A. Confidential and Gladiator.  The rest of the cast, led by Mary MacCormack, Hank Azaria, Burt Reynolds, Colm Meany and Lolita Davidovitch makes up a believable ensemble.  The one drawback to this type of film is the predictability of its ending, but it could have done worse by devolving into one of those sickening stand up and cheer films.  To its credit, Mystery, Alaska ends as it began, believably.  This one, particular small town gets to return to normal after its fifteen minutes of fame.  This is not a great film, but most patrons will not find their entertainment dollar too poorly spent, while hockey fans will want to see it again.

I am usually pretty skeptical about hockey movies because they usually focus on goons, or make a mockery of the sport like The Mighty Ducks. This movie was great though and I loved it.OK, It was more than a little strange to see Russel Crowe cast as a tough old Alaskan Sheriff and aging town hockey player knowing he is Australian and has probably never played the game in his life. He pulled it off almost flawlessly though.The story is about a town that prides itself on its weekly Saturday Hockey game, made up of the best the town has to offer. A now big shot in New York, former town resident returns and tries to redeem his reputation in the town by telling them that the New York Rangers are coming to play the towns best.It's a pretty charming story with a few intertwined love stories, drama, plenty of comedy, and oh yeah, a little bit of Hockey.It's a great story all around with a little bit for everyone to love and has a great small town feel to it that many can relate to.In The end it is a great movie that is fun to watch and the hockey aspect is decent as well. If you are a guy like me, you can actually con women out of their usual chick flick in favor of this one if you play up the comedy, love, and Russel Crowe aspects, and let's face it guys, anything is much better than having to watch another boring Hugh Grant movie!Like my reviews?

Mystery falls somewhere in between those compliments, but transcending hockey is what this movie can hang its skates on. The title says it all. Instead of being called cliche underdog title, or intense sports words it simply refers to the town it takes place in, because that's what's at its heart. Even if the sexual humor is completely awkward and the swearing uncalled for, this movie is about the pride of a small town whose very existence centers around hockey.For one thing, it's worth mentioning that Mystery, Alaska is not based on a true story. Thank goodness. Just because a story is true doesn't make it a great sports movie. Mystery takes all the best elements of an underdog sports story and blends them with this small- town concept by David E. Kelly (Doogie Howser, Allie McBeal and The Practice creator) and Sean O'Byrne.Russell Crowe stars as the veteran anchor of the city hockey team as well as the town sheriff of Mystery, Alaska, where everyone knows everyone and hockey is all that matters. Charlie (Hank Azaria), who grew up in Mystery but flew the nest to be a journalist, writes a piece on the team in Sports Illustrated that captures the interest of the NHL They want the New York Rangers to fly out to Mystery and play the Alaskans. Meanwhile we learn how word spreads in a town like Mystery. One player aptly named Skank is having an affair with the mayor's wife, the youngest player and his girlfriend try becoming sexually active to awkward results and Charlie's presence creates some conflict between John (Crowe) and his wife (Mary McCormack). There's also a lawsuit pending against the sharpshooter of the team because he shot a corporate bigwig in the foot. It's funny but kind of a sad moment when the jury reads the verdict of not guilty with a sly smile and everyone rejoices because without that player, the Mystery team would have surely lost.The small-town politics might be kind of goofy and the random sexual remarks puzzling, but it gives Mystery a soul and keeps it from being dependent on game footage. There's a little bit of game footage early on and then not until the face off with the Rangers. Those scenes become that much more interesting when they don't dominate the film -- a way too common error of most sports movies. Although there is a training montage and a slow clap in this movie, the intention is well and the heart still there.Mystery has some classic moments for a sports film and that's all you can ask for. It might not be the sports epic that Miracle became five years later, but it has that genuinely friendly small-town sensibility making it not only unique, but also less glamorized. It's easy to excuse a film with this much heart of all its quirks and flaws.~Steven CVisit my site http//moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"For hockey fans only","Date":"25 June 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":" The folks who live in tiny Mystery, Alaska love their Saturday hockey games. Playing on the team is a big deal to most men, and when Sheriff John Biebe (Russell Crowe) gets cut because he's too old and too slow, he feels awful. It's even worse when a former Mysterian returns from the big city with news that the New York Rangers are coming to play the locals on national TV.The subtitle for this movie could well be Northern Exposure on Ice or even Rocky in Skates. It's the tale of quirky small towners with all their domestic ups and downs who naturally pull together for the Big Game against the city slickers. In other words, it's pretty corny and predictable unless you're a hockey fan, in which case you'll probably love this movie. An ensemble piece, we don't see a whole lot of Russell Crowe; it's just as well because he seems woefully out of place. Yes, he can skate, but he's just too intense and intimidating for this lighthearted comedy. Sharing the screen with the likes of Burt Reynolds, Mike Meyers, and Little Richard diminishes his star quality considerably.

I almost forgot that before he made L.A. Confidential he was relatively unknown in the U.S. and it was only when he was nominated for an Oscar for The Insider that his movies became big events.That aside, this is an immensely entertaining little movie and Crowe has a very sympathetic character here. His character has many things in common with characters in other sports movies like Walter Matthau in Bad News Bears and most of these movies have a strict formula. They usually revolve around underdogs and here we get a local hockey team who gets a chance to play against a NHL team, the New York Rangers. There are not many ways to tamper with this formula and indeed Mystery, Alaska does not stray from it. Instead we get very enjoyable hockey action and the usual rivalry between the better hockey player and the one who thinks he should be the star. In this case the part is filled out nicely by Ron Eldard, who is not a household name, at least not here in Denmark, but he has made a few films that stuck with me, one of them being the revenge drama Sleepers. Here he has a much larger part and he does well as the arrogant rival to Crowe.The other supporting actors like Burt Reynolds and Hank Azaria are mostly decorative but there is no one who can play smarmy better than Azaria and Reynolds does well as a more dignified character than he has ever played before (check out his senator in Striptease to compare). The sole female, Lolita Davidovich, is terribly underwritten but that is typical of this kind of movie.Last there is a cameo by Mike Myers who of course struck gold with the director of this film and this is as it should be. So many directors do the same so why not here. The actual big game is not that extraordinary but there are enough good moments to make this a pleasant viewing experience.

It wasn't about the shot that almost tied the game with the Rangers. When the drama of the 2003 Tour de France was unfolding and people were speculating on whether Lance Armstrong would come back for a sixth attempt, all I could think of was his earlier marital problems during spring training.

Russel Crowe is perfect as the town sheriff who is being snubbed by the Saturday hockey team. Hank Azaria is perfect as the former Mystery boy who goes to New York, writes a story about the Mystery hockey team, and gets a match with the New York Rangers set up in Mystery. some SPOILERS - I have to give much credit to the writers who chose to not have Mystery win the game, that would have been too trite and unrealistic. However, their jumping to a 2-0 lead after the first period, then at the end coming back from 5-2 down to almost tie the game was a much better approach. They learned they could be competitive with the best professional team on the planet, and could hold their heads up high. The whole story is much less about hockey, much more about relationships of the people in this small town. In tone it reminds me of the Australian film, The Dish, except here the townspeople rally around a hockey match, instead of a moon exploration signal relay to the world.Filmed in and around Banff and Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

It really IS the Rocky of hockey!","Date":"2 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  Mystery, Alaska is kind of like The Mighty Ducks, except that it's intended for an older, more intelligent audience. The characterization as well as the narrative structure is much more mature, and the players, thankfully, are not little kids but people with a wide range of ages that have played hockey their entire lives as a result of having always lived in such brutally cold weather.There seems to be an underlying theme about the damaging effects of sudden fame, or even the possibility of sudden and even temporary fame, as the town of Mystery goes to great lengths to build onto their town (particularly the pond), so that they will be ready when the New York Rangers arrive. The biggest strength that the Mystery team had was playing on a pond as opposed to in a rink, and building this rink in their town cancelled out that advantage, making their chances of winning against the professional Rangers much smaller. (spoilers) Like in Rocky, the point here is not to win the game, because they lost to the Rangers, but the Mystery team went that distance and played a good game against a professional team. They played against all odds and they held their own, and literally came within inches of winning the game against a team that had tremendous advantages against them. After that last shot bounced off of the goal, barely missing, the audience is left trying to figure out a way that the game will have to continue long enough for the home team to win, but when Burt Reynolds (in an excellent performance as the town judge as well as the father f one of the payers) starts clapping, it is clear that the game is over and that they have lost. However, the applause that follows, especially that that came from the Rangers, bouncing their sticks on the ice as a show of respect, indicates that they succeeded despite having lost the game. Mystery, Alaska is an excellent film that gives the sports genre a much needed boost, showing an untraditional but refreshing and very effective conclusion that seems bittersweet but leaves you cheering. Russell Crowe further proves his amazing versatility as an actor, and all others involved also performed beautifully. The location is perfectly presented, almost making the audience feel cold just because the setting is so realistic, and the team really does look like a team of small town guys who have known each other and played hockey together all of their lives. You might be able to say that Mystery, Alaska pans out a little too similar to the way that Rocky did, but this is still a great film that just makes you feel good.

He is suspecting that his wife still has feelings for her old boyfriend from High School. Yikes! He gets cut from the Mystery team so another skater can play in the Saturday game. He is not happy about that. But things usually have a way of working out in the end. Mystery, Alaska is a small town whose citizens were basically born on skates. These people put their heart and soul into hockey and they are excellent at it. They play every Saturday to better train themselves-it is a town tradition, and everyone attends the games. Hank Azaria *Animal from Godzilla, plays Charlie Danner, a long ago citizen of Mystery, who writes an article for Sports Illustrated on the Mystery Hockey team. After this, he enters Mystery in a helicopter proclaiming to bear the New York Rangers; promising that the Mystery team will play a game of pond hockey against them. This turns into frenzy, causing the town to construct a humungous rink, larger than the one used for the Olympics, tapping them on the construction. The there is a problem, the NY Rangers don't want to play pond hockey in Alaska. Well, Maury Chaykin *he was the prison guard in The Mask of Zorro, plays Bailey Pruitt. Bailey is the lawyer who has to go to NY for a court hearing to see if he can change the Rangers' minds. Well, the NY players end up coming to Alaska to play pond hockey. Burt Reynolds *Boogy, Nights as Jack Horner, is the town Judge, and the old Bear of hockey, he knows most about hockey and taught most of the kids of Mystery how to skate. I won't spoil the end, but I will say that it has a very surprising ending.This movie isn't about who wins, who loses, if they tie or not, it is about playing a game you love to play, and pouring your heart into it trying. It was extremely well done, and it has a few surprising twists. All in all, this movie has an All-Star cast, and some incredible performances.

There are genuinely funny moments and some pretty deep emotional ones, but the movie fails to draw the viewer into its fabricated world.  I could not identify with the characters, I could not laugh with them, or even commiserate them.  Also, for the enormous amount of sex jokes and sexual tension present throughout the movie, the film makers kept away from even a brief nude shot.  That adds to the incongruencies of the movie's governing mood (there is none!) and confuses the heck out of anybody watching.

He has not only the looks and talent, but the special charisma to be a big movie star. He plays John Biebe, the sheriff of Mystery and one of the town's hockey stars. The big game every Saturday is a major event, much like college football or basketball in alot of small towns. When a former resident of the town returns to profile the team in Sports Illustrated, the National Hockey League comes up with a marketing idea send the N.Y. Rangers to Mystery to take on the team. This will bring great exposure to the town, but there is alot of tension.The residents of the town are afraid of being embarassed on the ice by the Rangers. John is in danger of losing his spot on the team to much younger and faster Stevie Weeks and losing his wife to Charlie, the SI writer with whom she once had a relationship. He has helped bring the Rangers and supplied the town with its own Zamboni in the hopes of getting people to like him. The local judge, played by Burt Reynolds, is bitter for never getting to play in the Saturday game and never misses an opportunity to criticize his hockey-playing son for not passing the puck or playing defense. This movie is entertaining and has an impressive cast. It was co-written by David E. Kelley, but like his other movie efforts, To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday & Lake Placid, lacks the magic of his excellent TV writing (The Practice, Ally McBeal). However, if you're a fan of Kelley or Crowe or love hockey, you will enjoy this film.

Kelley tries his hand at writing another feature film after the bizarre &#145;Lake Placid'.  This is certainly better than that, but the plot presents us with nothing new or fresh and meanders around town doing random character studies on unimportant characters.  Still, it's hard not to like a film where a small town hockey club roughs up the New York Rangers.The story revolves around the small town of Mystery, Alaska where the only thing to do or talk about is hockey.  John Biebe (Russell Crowe) is the sheriff and a veteran of the Saturday hockey game, which is the focal point of Mystery's culture.  As a result of an article written in Sports Illustrated, the NHL and the NY Rangers think it would be a good promotional gimmick for the Rangers to play this scrappy bunch of amateurs.  So now the town is in a tizzy over this defining moment in their history.Kelley's script expands this film to be much longer than it should have been.  He spends far too much time following the gossip of who's sleeping with whom among ancillary characters, and not enough time in character development of the players other than Biebe.  Director Jay Roach does a good job, however of keeping the viewer engaged through the use of excellent hockey action shots that take you right onto the ice.  Also, how can you not love the majestic mountain backdrops in just about every outdoor scene.Once the film at long last gets to the game, it succeeds at accomplishing what the formula intends, that is, it gets us to pull hard for the underdog.For Russell Crowe, this was much less intense than his roles in &#145;The Insider' and &#145;Gladiator'.  He did a nice job of portraying the old warhorse, giving the character steadiness, dignity and determination.  I wonder where a guy from Australia learned to ice skate so well.  Colm Meaney gave a good performance as the mayor but Burt Reynolds was a little stiff as the judge.Though there is a lot to criticize about this film, it is still entertaining and for those who love hockey, it does a good job of providing some up-close action footage of the game.

Even the sidewalks are flooded during the wintertime and once each week, the top dozen or so players get together for the `Saturday Game.'Those who cannot play the game write about it, evidently. Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) left Mystery a long time ago to pursue a career in sports-writing, only to return years later to write a story about the Saturday Game for none other than Sports Illustrated.The story so captures the imagination of the executives of the National Hockey League in New York, that they decide it would be a good promotion to send the mighty Rangers up to the frozen north to take on our boys from Mystery in a mid-season exhibition match.But shinny players from Mystery prove to be better than expected, what with the larger rink and the freezing temperatures, and, to quote Mike Myers, who makes a cameo appearance, it's `Game On!'Comparisons to the genre classic `Slap Shot' are inevitable, and it seems that the folks who put together the advertising for this movie are not-so-subtly billing this movie as Son of Slap Shot.But a closer comparison can be made to the long-running television series `Northern Exposure', because as much as this is a movie about hockey, it's even more a movie about a small Alaskan town, where everybody knows everybody and gossip travels faster than a speeding puck.Of particular interest is `Skank' Marden (Ron Eldard) who fools around with as many women as possible when he's not playing hockey, `because sex and hockey are the two funnest things you can do in the winter.'But there are plenty of other personalities, the central one being town sheriff John Biebe (Russell Crowe). After 13 successive years, Biebe is getting slow and the town fathers are threatening to cut him from the Saturday Game to make room for the speedy youngster Steve Weeks (Ryan Northcott).Biebe doesn't take it well, and matters aren't helped when Danner, an old flame of his wife's is back in town and making passes at her while not busy being a conceited big city media schmuck.Indeed, with all the mini-dramas going on, it seems that there is little time left for the big game. But the Rangers do show up, and the puck is dropped for the climactic final scenes.For the most part, Mystery, Alaska comes across as a light-hearted soap opera. And that's no surprise considering the movie was written and produced by David E. Kelley, the creator of Ally McBeal and The Practice.(That it was directed by Jay Roach, who also directed the Austin Powers movies probably explains the cameo appearance by Myers).Mystery, Alaska is no Slap Shot (who could ever forget the infamous Hanson Brothers?) and considering that Kelley has a full two-hours to play with, the character development remains a little light for a feature-length film.But nonetheless, Mystery, Alaska is an enjoyable yarn, augmented by beautiful scenery -- the movie was filmed in and around Camrose, Alberta and full use is made of the Rockies.

Russell Crowe leads all-star cast that included Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin and Burt Reynolds in Mystery, Alaska.  Full of hope, pride and determination, Mystery, Alaska will capture the hearts of the audience.   A 13 year tradition in Mystery where everybody comes together to participate in the Saturday game, a hockey game played every Saturday, draws the interest of the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers.Charles Danner (Azaria) comes to propose this challenge to the townspeople of Mystery. After some debate at a town meeting, the mayor (Meaney) accepts the challenge to play the Rangers; the players must put their personal feelings aside to win the game.  This game between the team from Mystery and the Rangers becomes a David and Goliath match-up, which ultimately comes down to which team can outduel the other first. Can the team from Mystery rise to the challenge given by the New York Rangers?  Russell Crowe is an actor that has brought integrity to his roles such as Officer Bud White in L.A. Confidential. Crowe, who received critical praise as Bud White, brought the same amount of integrity to Mystery, Alaska, as soft-spoken Sheriff John Biebe.  Burt Reynolds, who has starred in Boogie Nights and received an Oscar nomination for his role as Jack Horner, portrayed hard-nosed Judge Walter Burns in Mystery Alaska. Reynolds role as Judge Burns turned out to be very impressive since it seemed that he took his time and enjoyed portraying the small town judge/coach from Mystery. Co-writers David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne as well as director Jay Roach work in conjunction to make one of the best films in 1999. Kelley, who has enjoyed success as producer of The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope, L.A. Law and Picket Fences, has brought originality to the film. This film allows the audience to sit back, relax and focus on putting themselves in the movie. Mystery, Alaska is a highly recommended film that should be seen by everybody because it was performed by a talented cast, well-put together by the writers and director, has a great plot, and noteworthy performances by the actors.

It's about the pride that a small town has in itself. Most of the TV commercials and ads show scenes of the game but the movie actually revolves around the town, it's citizens and the relationships they have with each other. It isn't until the end of the movie that you see the game.Mystery is a small town in Alaska where the residents are infatuated with the game of hockey. So much so that they have their own team that comes out every Saturday to play in front of the entire town. The team is managed by members from their City Hall and making it onto this team is like making it to the NHL for many of the young men of the town. Not too long after the movie starts, as a result of an article about this Alaskan team in Sports Illustrated, the team is scheduled to play the famous NHL franchise, the New York Rangers. The rest of the story builds up to this big game but a surprising thing happens during this journey. Unlike a lot of other movies about sports, this one doesn't focus as much on the sport as it does on the town itself. The story shows the town residents, their daily lives and how the game of hockey is weaved into the cultural fabric of the town. For the residents, it isn't just a game. It's a source of their pride and when the big city team comes to town with their bright lights and big cameras, they're threatened to be swept aside and made a mockery of. Facing this adversity, lead by their mayor, the town comes together to show the world watching that the little town of Mystery, Alaska is proud of their small town ways and the boys that play a game for the love of it.The movie does a wonderful job of showing the town and the ruggedness of the country. It also does a very good job of showing some of the personal issues that some of the players have to deal with. Burt Reynolds plays the town's judge and I found him to be absolutely wonderful. He played his character incredibly well and thoroughly believable. Russell Crowe portrays the town sheriff and, like Reynolds, I found his performance very well done. I have a feeling that Crowe is an actor that you will be seeing a lot more of in the future. Most of the rest of the supporting cast does an admirable job at creating the atmosphere of small town people and it definitely adds to the reality of the movie.For all it's good points, the movie does have elements that I found somewhat unappealing. The humor in it was for the most part, funny. I found myself laughing quite often but there were the occasional bumps that I didn't like. For some reason or other, the movie industry seems to have come to the conclusion that old people swearing is funny. It may have it's place if it's done properly but when it's put into the movie purely for the sake of drawing a laugh without any real substance to it, it comes off cheap. This was the case in which during a town meeting, an old lady gets up and voices her opinion in a rather colorful way. The story also drags a bit and occasionally makes the movie feel long. There are also some inconsistencies here and there that you'll notice. One final thing, this movie is not another Mighty Ducks movie. There is a lot of foul language and suggestive subject matter. This may not be the best movie to take your kids to.Overall, the movie is about heart and you definitely sense it....7/10.

The players were portrayed excellently, and the hockey sequences were truly authentic. This, combined with a fun storyline made it a rather enjoyable movie. There's even a nice little bit of romance thrown in for good measure. In my opinion Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Mary McCormack and Lolita Davidovich were the real hilights of this film.

Attempting to be a heart-warming comedy, this movie ultimately left me with a taste for the script writer's blood. Plot  Can you say Mighty Ducks?  This movie is every pulpy feel-good movie ever made.  A small town's pond hockey team is so good that an ex-member looking for acceptance brings back the N.Y. Rangers.  Very tacky idea.  Not even the game has any suspense, although your hopes may be dashed.  I still like how SPOILER SPOILER WATCH OUT SPOILER how even though they only lose by one point, the two players are still sent to the minor leagues.  READ AGAIN READ AGAIN.  They deal lightly with all major issues from heart attacks to adultery to good, old-fashioned morals.  Everybody is sleeping with everybody else.  I have never seen such a happy movie with so much sexual innuendo that seemed so out of place.Cliches  Everybody is swearing, and frankly I am tired of old ladies who swear out of the context of the character and the movie.  The try to make old ladies say something shocking so that is funny.  Betty White in Lake Placid was one thing because that movie was not pretentious and actually knew how bad i was, so they could get away with it.  And her character swore every five seconds.  If it was out of the mouth of a thirty or forty-something, it would have even been funny.  However this movie made the situation purely boring.  Extra-marital affairs bring characters closer together  In real life the affairs break relationships, not bring them closer.  This that and the other everything is a cliche.Acting  Eh.  Review  Although I sort of enjoyed watching this movie, I hated myself afterwards. I thought that it had its good points, but it was a movie that fools you.  I ended up hating it, and thought it was awful, and would never see it again.  Some scenes will strike you as funny, and is funny afterwards, like the jokes around the premature sex scene.  Everything else seemed so, i don't know, ordinary, common-place, etc. The game was even boring.  No tension whatsoever.  The best part of the movie was Little Richard, and his role only lasted 30 seconds.  Keep Richard and destroy everybody else.  Skip this movie, and you will have lost absolutely nothing.  Go see American Beauty rather than a movie which gives about 2-minutes to a heart attack instead of actually giving us time to be sad and reflect.

So big it's what actually the whole movie is about! Being a fan of a 1st division football club that plays multiple test-games against some 5th or 6th division amateurs every season, usually away from home and often televised, I find the whole fuss difficult to understand. But it does provide a mildly amusing atmosphere that I suppose counts for the Comedy tag the movie got, as there's barely anything else funny there. Certainly not the premature-ejaculation type of jokes or the played-out one-liners.Elaborathing further is not worthy of my time. The story is clich√©d beyond belief, predictable and boring. The jokes are corny. The music sounds like produced by some one-click-soap-track-generator. The acting is way over the top. The whole movie is a sappy piece of cheese.Interesting only for die-hard Hollywood soap connoisseurs or for ones who might dig Russel Crowe sporting some strange mullet and a fur hat.

Russell Crowe leads all-star cast that included Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin and Burt Reynolds in Mystery, Alaska. Full of hope, pride and determination, Mystery, Alaska will capture the hearts of the audience. A 13-year tradition in Mystery where everybody comes together to participate in the Saturday game, a hockey game played every Saturday, draws the interest of the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers.Azaria comes to propose this challenge to the townspeople of Mystery. After some debate at a town meeting, the mayor accepts the challenge to play the New York Rangers; the players must put their personal feelings aside to win the game. This game between the team from Mystery and the Rangers becomes a David and Goliath match-up, which ultimately comes down to which team can outduel the other first. Can the team from Mystery rise to the challenge given by the New York Rangers? Crowe is an actor that has brought integrity to his roles such as Officer Bud White in L.A. Confidential. Crowe, who received critical praise as Bud White, brought the same amount of integrity to Mystery, Alaska, as soft-spoken Sheriff John Biebe. Burt Reynolds, who has starred in Boogie Nights and received an Oscar nomination for his role as Jack Horner, portrayed hard-nosed Judge Walter Burns in Mystery Alaska. Reynolds role as Judge Burns turned out to be very impressive since it seemed that he took his time and enjoyed portraying the small town judge/coach from Mystery.Co-writers David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne as well as director Jay Roach work in conjunction to make one of the best films in 1999. Kelley, who has enjoyed success as producer of The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope, L.A. Law and Picket Fences, has brought originality to the film. This film allows the audience to sit back, relax and focus on putting themselves in the movie. Mystery, Alaska is a highly recommended film that should be seen by everybody because it was performed by a talented cast, well-put together by the writers and director, has a great plot, and noteworthy performances by the actors.

Directed by AUSTIN POWERS 1&2's Jay Roach and written by TV kingpin David E Kelley, ALASKA is just the type of film you might expect these two to make without any of the people and ideas involved that made their respected earlier works so memorable. While not a terrible film, MYSTERY is often lacking in so many areas and ideas, it's hard to love it.Taking place in the small icy town of Mystery, the story concerns a commonwealth who's main concerns are knit caps and who will play in the community's weekly Saturday hockey game. A former resident(THE SIMPSONS's Hank Azaria), who has moved to New York and become a Sports Illustrated reporter, returns with news that the New York Rangers hockey team is coming to Mystery to play the local boys in a nationally broadcast event. Elated by the prospect of notoriety yet wary of the affect the publicity will have on the small community, the town sheriff (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL's Russell Crowe) - a former player himself, and the town judge (Burt Reynolds) join forces to whip the team into shape for the big game.This being Mr. Kelley's second produced screenplay in three months, MYSTERY, ALASKA suffers from a bizarre comparison to the earlier script LAKE PLACID. While Kelley has a knack for characterization and tone, both scripts fall dangerously close to condescension and plagiarism. Anybody who saw the mildly amusing PLACID will recall Betty White's cringe inducing, profanity-laden dialog. In MYSTERY, we have another scene of an old woman cursing, adding to that a moment where a small child uses the F-word. Obviously, these moments are there to get a laugh. They don't, only coming off as desperate attempts to charm and shock when nothing else works. And as with PLACID, MYSTERY spends an inordinately amount of time on giving each and every character a backstory of somesorts. In PLACID it helped to fill an already skimpy 80 minute running time. In MYSTERY, it pushes the lethargic story to the 120 minute range. If it ain't SLAP SHOT, then I don't need a two hour hockey film. The endless story spiral is tiring and unneeded in both films. MYSTERY even has the gall to end the picture with big things happening to two characters we've barely met. It's hard to get excited when your third cousin gets a promotion, and it's even harder to achieve cinematic goosebumps over characters whom you couldn't even recall names for.With Jay Roach, it's now clear who really makes the AUSTIN POWERS films so enjoyable, Mike Myers. The unpredictable nature of those successful comedies are long gone in MYSTERY. Working with a talented cast of unrecognized stars (Crowe, Azaria, Reynolds, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, and Colm Meaney ) and the setting of Alaska, Roach still manages to create a vastly uninteresting film. Flat and without vitality, it's shocking considering the film uses and abuses the same sports film clich√©s that have worked on me time and again. Roach doesn't seem to have a clue what to do with this film except keep his head down and stick to the script.I have a deep affection for snow movies (FARGO, the recent JACK FROST, hell even THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) and Roach blows the cold weather setting with dismal and distancing cinematography. Shooting in a stark white environment and then dressing your actors in white outfits probably wasn't the best aesthetic choice Roach could have made. He also cannot seem to get an idea how to shoot the hockey scenes. With frenetic editing and bad camera angles, MYSTERY earns it's name just for trying to figure out who has the puck. Even last minute cameos by Mike Myers (who easily contributes the film's only funny line) and Little Richard cannot save MYSTERY from failing.It's no secret that the film is formulaic. Released by Disney, MYSTERY often feels like a big bad adult version of THE MIGHTY DUCKS. Boiling it down, these types of films can only end two different ways. Either the team wins the big game or they don't. I was hoping Roach and Kelley could come up with something inventive for a climax, but they don't even bother. It's all one big audience pleasing film that forgot to please the audience.I really wanted to get into the spirit of MYSTERY, ALASKA, but the filmmakers kept me away. Roach can go back to the psychedelic world in the colorful AUSTIN POWERS films, and Kelley can continue writing heady stuff for THE PRACTICE and the other one million shows he has created. Both men obviously have talent, but this film doesn't help that argument. Coming so soon after John Sayles's thought provoking and decidedly more entertaining Alaska odyssey LIMBO, MYSTERY, ALASKA seems like a slapshot across the face.----------------- 3  "},{"Title":"Great!","Date":"4 June 2001","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  I'm not a Hockey fan...But this movie was Excellent!

The movie is about a small town in Alaska where tradition rules and hockey is the name of the game. Russell Crowe plays John Biebe who is not only the town sheriff he is also one of the stars of the Saturday hockey game. The town takes much pride in their Saturday hockey game so much when they want to bring in the young high school player; there is an actual vote on if they should allow him on the team. Burt Reynolds plays Judge Walter Burns who once played in the Saturday game when he was younger. He now has a son who plays in the Saturday game. The entire town revolves around this game and they take pride in their players and their small town. Hank Azaria plays Charles Danner who has moved away from Mystery because he feels the small town is holding him back and he thinks things are much better in the big city. He decides Mystery needs to be put on the map and he arranges a hockey game with a major professional team.

The residents of Mystery take the game as serious as the Pope takes communion, and their infamous pond of black ice is their Holiest of Holies. If you've never pushed a Puck on it, you've never played hockey at all. For as long as anyone can remember (probably when hockey was first invented) everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, shows up in sub-zero weather to watch the immortal Saturday Game, which is made up of the most practiced and talented players who are hand picked by the Mayor and his small committee of experts. When a writer form Sports Illustrated and former resident of Mystery (Hank Azaria) writes an article about the talented Boys of Winter, it creates enough publicity for them to score an exhibition game with the New York Rangers. After a long-winded debate, the players decide to go through with it. Gee, ya think? The film tries to make an argument whether the town's dignity will be destroyed if they get their cans kicked in, but we know all along the big game will happen. No game, no movie.Speaking of movie, the story shouldn't have been made into one. Two hours of celluloid is nowhere near enough time to care about this cast because we hardly get to learn anything about them. Director Jay Roach should have chosen to make Mystery, Alaska into a pleasant television series, where we could revisit the town and the people who live there every week for several seasons and for several years. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that Roach told his actors to watch reruns of Northern Exposure before showing up on the set. Every character is formulated with very little history and they're all pretty much the same pleasant, seemingly good-natured, and at times, funny. There are no stand out performances. That's right, not even Russell Crowe. No, not Burt Reynolds either. If anyone juts out a little its Azaria. He's hated by the whole town because he left it to become successful. Hank tries to play an ego maniac, but we see he's good-natured along with everyone else. Now why are we supposed to hate him again?The film focuses on more than just hockey. The judge's teenage daughter tries to lose her virginity. The Mayor's wife commits adultery with Skank, the town Lothario. A foul-mouthed out-of-towner gets shot in the foot by a grocer. All of these sub plots have nothing to do with what gives the movie its momentum. The repercussions of their actions? We care not. If they had any kind of history at all, maybe, just maybe, we'd give a hoot.Much of the film is shot outdoors where everyone seems to be easy to find. Hey, there's the Sheriff! Hey, there goes the Judge! Never mind the fact that it's consistently below freezing and that the heaters are all working inside, because Mystery folk love weather that would make a snowman shiver and a penguin complain. I kept waiting for someone to say Go ahead sweetheart, watch the Saturday Game without me and I'll skip the barbecue too. I'll stay right here with my cocoa and blanket. Have fun watching pond hockey with all the other lunatics!Okay, okay, enough with the sarcasm and on with some good news. The big match-up against the Red, White and Blue is something we look forward to and we want the underdog to win. Why wouldn't we? Everyone is likable, and the Rangers are all faceless, giant robots form a land far, far away. Mike Myers makes a cameo appearance and elicits a few giggles as a Canadian sports announcer, and Little Richard sings the National Anthem for the big event. He looks thoroughly out of place in Mystery which makes for good visual comedy, yet I'm not sure why he'd take his tour bus to Alaska or how it made it through the snow.Mystery, Alaska is convoluted more than it is bad, and every single plot thread ties up too nicely as if to cater to everyone's petty sensibilities. It ends as if to let everyone say goodbye with forgiveness, which left me feeling squeamish. The roles are superficially orchestrated and clich√©. I'll continue to wonder if Mystery, Alaska will ever be made into a T.V. series, airing just after Survivor or something. And if that ever happens, I'll be staying out of the cold.

Their sidewalks are used for skating. The sheriff is the Captain. The town meetings are determined for who is the next to play and who is to retire. Mystery lives and breathes hockey. But one day, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED writes an article on this small hockey town, and the NHL decides to have the New York Rangers travel to Alaska to play the team of Mystery. The concept is very good. But everything is done so bland that no emotion is really felt. The characters are extremely weak too. The perfect man to question would be the Mayor (played by Colm Meaney). After being cheated on, ask yourself how you would act. Then compare yourself to the Mayor. Hank Azaria also played a pretty petty role as the man who brought the Rangers to Mystery though his other part as high school ex to the the Sheriff's wife should have been played out more. Much more could have been done and stretched out, and it would not have felt long neither. But what's done is done, and a half done job will not get the results you want.

As this is, however, an entirely fictional tale, one becomes less willing to forgive the utter lack of originality demonstrated by the film's makers.  For `Mystery, Alaska' rarely strays far from the tried-and-true clich√©s of the old underdog-up-against-seasoned-champs scenario that seems all but mandatory for sports films these days.   This David vs.Goliath tale offers only the novelty of its small-town Alaska setting to offset the dull romantic subplots &#150; involving adultery, rekindled romance, unconsummated first time sexual encounters &#150; which drone on for much of the film's exhausting two hour running time.  The `David' in this case is an amateur pond hockey team that is the pride and joy of this secluded Alaskan village known as Mystery.  Here, the residents literally think, breathe and live hockey, so much so that the weekly Saturday morning games become the center of public life for the entire town.  One day their lives all change when a former resident who left Mystery to start a career as a successful journalist manages to print an article on the team in `Sports Illustrated.'  Intrigued, the NHL &#150; and herein lies the incredibility &#150; decides to send the New York Rangers to challenge the team to a duel on the latter's own home turf, or, more accurately, their own home ice pond.  Thus, the `Goliath' is all set up to take his nasty fall &#150; though, to the film's one credit, it doesn't entirely succumb to the predictability of that aspect of the allusion. That, however, is the sole area in which the film displays even a modicum of originality.  For the most part, we are stuck with a bevy of drab, two-dimensional, stereotypical characters who look far too glamorous for the setting and behave far too predictably to be either believable or interesting.   The normally gifted, usually dynamic Russell Crowe sleepwalks through his role as an aging player who finds himself suddenly deleted from the team in favor of an up and coming teenager.  Mary McCormack plays his perpetually cheerful, devoted wife who feels sudden stirrings of unrequited love when her former boyfriend, the man who has brought the Rangers to the town, returns for his semi-annual visit.  Burt Reynolds, in the most stereotypical role of all, appears as the grumpy town judge who can't accept the fact that he never made the team himself in his youth and now takes it out on his son through an assortment of disapproving looks and comments.  Do we doubt for a moment that his heart will melt at the appropriate moment late in the film?  In fact, the film is riddled with moments of drippy sentimentality, as lovers and spouses easily mend all breaches brought about by infidelity and jealousy, learning to become `better people' in the process &#150; all, of course, in time for the big game.  As these and many of the other, equally hackneyed characters play out their dreary domestic dramas, all we in the audience can do is while away the time till the inevitable showdown on the ice finally takes place.  Yet, when it comes, we realize that here too we have seen the setup a thousand times before.  Thus, even the hockey game, though well shot from a technical viewpoint, somehow manages to bore us.  Is it possible that, by their very nature, sporting events in movies just can't work?  Isn't much of the suspense and excitement of athletic competition generated by real-time factors of chance, unpredictability and unknown outcome?  Games that are contrived and scripted lose most of what we go to athletic events for and the result is that all these sports stories seem, somehow, self-defeating.Alas, `Mystery, Alaska,' though well intentioned and inoffensive, is instantly forgettable.

Kelly, helps sets the pace and probably the unofficial rules for popular culture while he writes Ally McBeal and The Practice.  I'd guess that I would have seen it all before if I watched more television.All of the expected characters are trooped out for this sporting film. But this is a adult version of the Mighty Ducks formula.And why not? As one of the players says fornication and hockey are the two fun things to do in cold weather.Australia's Russell Crowe does a good job of playing the older player on the local hockey team who doubles as the sheriff in this small town.He's the grizzled one who gets dropped and made coach of this small town team when it's slated to take  on a major team from New York as a promotional venture.There's the speedy, premature ejaculating young gun who would like to have it off with the local judges daughter.And there's the sheriff's wife (Mary McCormack) who' s husband becomes jealous when she shows interest in a (God forbid) non skating journalist played by The Birdcage's Hank Azaria.)Burt Reynolds plays the Judge and former coach stiffly but overall this is a mildly pleasing time filler with a fair bit of bite for your puck.

There isthe town sheriff, John Biebe (Russell Crowe) who obeys and upholds the law.  The town judge, Judge Walter Burns (Burt Reynolds) who is more concerned about the town's dignity than anything else.  And the man who left town to become successful, Charles Danner (Hank Azaria). It's like any other typical American town, sort of like.....Mumford!     Instead of having the town's popular psychtrist being a phony, the claim to fame of Mystery is hockey, and Mystery does take it's hockey very seriously.  Every Saturday morning the entire town gather at a frozen pond to watch the local hockey athletes play.  This is a very big deal to Mystery.  Being on the hockey team is like being a part of the in-crowd. Just ask the local school teacher, Skank Marden (Ron Eldard), who not only plays hockey, but pretty much has intercourse with most of the women in Mystery.  Skank claims that hockey and sex is the only fun things in cold weather.  Mystery is very proud of it's players, they generate so much popularity over the years that successful former Mystery resident Charles Danner, writes a feature article of the Mystery hockey players in Sports Illustrated.      The feature article caught the eye of the National Hockey League, and they suggest to have a game with the Mystery hockey team play the.....New York Rangers!!!!!  This is very big news for Mystery.  The town mayor, Scott Pitcher (Colm Meaney) sees this as a major publicity event that will generate popularity with for the town.  But the Mystery's lawyer, Bailey Pruitt (Maury Chaykin) feels that it's the perfect opprotunity for the hockey team to finally get recognized.  And the town... well, they couldn't be more excited.      MYSTERY, ALASKA is a entertaining little film.  It's the film about the nobody's from nowhere who go up against the giants from metropolis.  And it does have it's moments.  The story is pretty basic, where the local team players have many different stories.  Skank can't seem to stop sleeping with various women, including the mayor's wife (Lolita Davidovich). Birdie Burns (Scott Grimes) is struggling to please his overbearring father, Judge Burns.  And Sheriff John Biebe, has to face almost retirement from age, and has to compete with the very young and very fast, Stevie Weeks (Ryan Northcott). While Stevie has to face what he's going to do with his relationship with, the Judge's daughter Marla Burns (Rachel Wilson).     If MYSTERY, ALASKA came out when it was originally suppose to be released (March 30th), it would have been a bigger hit, and a better film.  I think Hollywood Pictures was scared of THE MATRIX, therefore they decided to delay it.  Well, if it's not one Warner Bros. movie that's going to kill MYSTERY, ALASKA, then it's going to be another, and that movie is THREE KINGS.       Which is a shame, because MYSTERY deserves more business than it's getting.  Granted it is very similar to a typical small town film (i.e. NASHVILLE and MUMFORD), but it does grab one's intrest and it does have some very well done moments. Also, the hockey scenes are very exciting, but personally, I thought that there were too little.      What I thought stood out in the film were the actors and actresses.  Russell Crowe proves that he can carry a film very well, and be a very likable person.  Burt Reynolds is also very good as the strict town judge who also becomes the team's coach.  He shows that he his all hard on the outside, but also does have a soft spot inside of him.  And Maury Chaykin is also great as the town's lawyer, who doesn't protray the typical vicious and money-grubbing lawyer, but pretty much the most sensitive man in town.      There is also good support from Ron Eldard, Colm Meany, Hank Azaria, and Mary McCormack, the latter playing the wife of the sheriff.  But sadly, David E. Kelly can't really write a script for a film.  I'm sure that he's good for television character development, but with a film, it seems like that he's leaving some characteristics of the people out.  I will say this though, this is A LOT better than Kelly's previous screenplay, LAKE PLACID.     And Jay Roach does a decent job of mixing in the seriousness and comedy of the story.  And for those Jay Roach fans, there is a nice cameo surprise in this film.  But it's good for the director of the silly satires of AUSTIN POWERS take a somewhat serious turn.      MYSTERY, ALASKA is a good movie, but with other small town movies out there, it will be a mystery to where it went.  As for a hockey film, I personally thought that SLAP SHOT (1977) with Paul Newman was funnier.  Before I leave, I would like to point out the scenery.  IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!  I loved the scenery, I would like to live in the location where this film was made.  It's much better than the dry and hot region where I've lived for over 20 years.  ***1/2 (out of five) "},{"Title":"an adult Mighty Ducks clone/film!!where was everybody??!!","Date":"4 October 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sport","Review":"  This movie is about a town called Mystery ,Alaska(hence the name of the fim). The town lives hockey and everything is centered around it. A former resident (now a big sports magazine writer) tells every one that a big NHL team is coming to the town to play. The players of the team now have to get ready for the big game. It was now starting to feel like the Mighty Ducks movies.Although the movie was delayed(it was originally due out last July!!) it was a OK movie. We also get to look into the players personell lives, which I never saw in the Mighty Ducks movies. Mystery, Alaska has colorful cast with great stars!!One of them is Russell Crowe(L.A Confidental,The Quick and The Dead,The Insider) and Hank Azaria(Godzilla,Mystery Men) . It also has a cameo by Mike Myers(Austin Powers 1 and 2,Wayne's World) . The other hockey team play themselfes. Overall, if you like sports movies(I'm a causal fan of sports movies) , you might like this movie.Also since the guy behind the hit show Ally Mcbeal was doing the screenplay where was everybody? I thought he was popular!!? Maybe judging from the poor turn out he should stick to stuff like Lake Placid, Ally, The Pratice and Ally McBeal. My guess is the american public has not forgiven him for last summer's Lake Placid. If you want to see something diffrent from David A Kelly(writer/producer) then see this movie!!Who cares if it is almost a clone of the Mighty Ducks movie , then go check out this movie!!BTW this movie came in ninth on this opening weekend!!!

Well, it didn't score. The characters were not developed at all. I got the sense that I was just being given an overview. The movie jumps around from character to character, not giving you the chance to relate to any of them. The sexual comedy element in the film (to convince us that we're not watching the Mighty Ducks) would hardly be funny to a 14 year old, much less adults. Even the game at the end....what the whole movie led up to, was disappointing. If you are looking for a moving or inspiring picture, this is just not it. Even if you're just looking to be entertained for an hour and a half, look further. Mystery, Alaska is dull, clich√©, and utterly forgettable.

If I mentioned to you  Glasgow Rangers  would you understand i was talking about a Scottish football team ? Would you understand its political and religious affiliations ? Would you know of its standing in British / European / World soccer ? Secondly if this movie is marketed for ice hockey fans then why does it spend so much time on sub stories ? Worse why does it include sex scenes and some crude humour ? The idea of a sports comedy screams family film does it not ? But there's no way you'd be able to recommend MYSTERY ALASKA as family fare I'm only going on my own opinion guys so don't hate me for it but I found little to recommend in this movie , not even an early starring role by Russell Crowe "}]
