[{"Title":"Thankfully not another pretty conversation piece","Date":"10 August 2004","Score":"54 out of 62 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I'm usually put off by courtroom films simply because I associate them with either the tendency for pompous and ornate speech-making a la A Few Good Men, or cheap audience-manipulation a la Primal Fear. Yes, they are entertaining, usually with great actors and fine performances - thinking man's thrillers. But generally they remain nothing more than that - a well-done conversation piece. A Civil Action was a pleasant surprise because it is not only like neither of those films, but also because it is a good film starring John Travolta. While he had his moments in the spotlight for good reason (think Pulp Fiction) his movies are generally not that great. But that's just a personal opinion and I may be wrong.Still, A Civil Action is a great courtroom film. For one, it's a true story (which doesn't necessarily say much), and it is told with restraint, quietness and respect for the characters involved (which should be saying a lot). It takes the best from Silkwood and Verdict and it gives us people who are real and who engage in battle the way we imagine real people would. They don't have dramatic moments in the courtroom upon which an unreal stillness descends so as to be shattered at the end of the speech by the thunderous sound of unanimous, emotionally-fraught clapping.John Travolta is great here and so is the rest of the cast, among them William H. Macy, Kathleen Quinlan, Sydney Pollack, John Lithgow, Stephen Fry (in a small cameo role), Kathy Bates (in an even smaller cameo role) and the great Robert Duvall. In the end, it is Duvall who steals the show in his quiet, unemotional musings, advice-givings and deliberations with Travolta. He embodies the restraint for which the film strives. A Civil Action is quiet in its proceedings and, consequently real. It tells the story of a lawyer who reluctantly accepts a case having to do with the contamination of water and the deaths of many children in a small town and becomes obsessed with it to the point of going bankrupt. His obsession mirrors the self-destructiveness of Paul Newman's lawyer in Verdict, and it has real results. His adversaries are not evil people, per se (think Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men), but people who are simply doing their jobs damn well, defending their interests. We shouldn't expect them to cave in to pretty speech-making, nor should the jury.And watching A Civil Action we don't and it doesn't. The personalities clash, personal tragedy is pitted against financial burdens of the legal process, and it yields startling conclusions about the American Justice system. And that is what A Civil Action chooses to focus on more so than the true story it tells (though it doesn't ignore it either). The film shows the price of justice and how justice is understood in the legal process. In fact, it draws a very fine dichotomy between non-legal justice and legal justice and shows how hard it is to get justice in a legal setting. Needless to say, it becomes a very expensive ordeal full of re-interpretations of the law and annoying manipulations of it. What we can gather from the story, however, is that we should be grateful for people who are willing to go to extreme lengths, at great personal cost, to define justice on their own terms and to fight for it.

In the real world court cases don't run to the formula; many cases are stillborn, many are settled before trial, some seemingly decisive victories are reversed on appeal. The lawyers generally seem to survive though. In the American system of civil litigation the contingent fee is common - the lawyer gets paid only if the client succeeds, usually a third of the verdict or settlement amount. This can lead to some pretty crass conduct.In this film, based on a very fine book about real events in the Boston area, we have a rather rare example of a lawyer trying so hard he defeats his own cause. Yet at the end he may have brought about a greater social good. Jan Schlictman (played with smarmy aplomb by John Travolta) is a seasoned plaintiff's lawyer in personal injury cases who knows all the tricks, both in pre-trial negotiation and before a jury. He is persuaded by an associate to look into a claim by a small community that its water has been poisoned by industrial waste resulting in the deaths of at least eight children from leukemia and other ailments. The case captures his attention and before long the entire resources of his four-partner firm are concentrated on it. They are up against a local tannery owner and two huge corporations, Beatrice and W&R Grace. Beatrice is represented by Faucher (a stand-out performance from Robert Duvall) a crusty veteran of 45 years litigation (and Harvard Law School lecturer), and he doesn't have much trouble cutting Jan down to size.Despite the escalating cost Jan doesn't seem to know when to stop. His partner James (another gem-like performance from William H Macy) does everything he can to raise money, including applying for credit cards from banks as far away as Fargo, North Dakota (those who saw Macy in Fargo will chuckle over that one.) Total disaster is averted but it seems that Jan has been fighting the wrong battle.To fit the mood the lighting is dull (surely the Boston Courts are not quite as gloomy as portrayed) and the weather awful. I've never seen it rain so much in a movie. Against this dismal backdrop the performances are luminous. Apart from those already mentioned there is John Lithgow (of Third Rock from the Sun fame) as a conceited judge, Kathleen Quinlan as a bereaved parent, Bruce Norris as Cheeseman, Grace's super nerd lawyer, Dan Hedaya as O'Reilly the evil tannery owner and Stephen Fry as a very English geologist. And who should pop up at the end as a bankruptcy judge but Kathy Bates.This is a case where I have read the book (by Jonathan Harr) and for the movie the film makers have rather sidelined the plaintiff/victims and focused more on Jan's manic prosecution of the case. This helps the drama but does give the impression that the plaintiffs were helpless bystanders. This was not so, as the book shows.As a movie this one succeeds very well. Some have complained it's a bit slow and requires rather too much legal knowledge from ordinary filmgoers but there is plenty of tension and the ending is as satisfactory as one gets in real life. It's a movie to make a lawyer cringe, and that is probably recommendation enough.

Two of America's biggest law firms defend the case which stretches over 9 years and threatens to bankrupt Schlichtmann's firm and all it's staff.I approached this film with firm expectations.  I work as an environmental consultant and in part of my law training I was advised to read the book as it was a good case study (albeit a 500 page case study) on a environmental case.  The book was fascinating if a little heavy in detail.  For the film I knew that much of it was going to be trimmed but I didn't realize how much.  The `trimmed' bit is the whole case!  There is none of the trial instead any court room scenes are more focused on the characters than the case.As a film this still plays well and is entertaining if not enlightening or interesting.  It still carries the mantle of being `true' but without any of the book's case detail it is never more than a Grisham-esque drama despite having a better ending.The cast are great &#150; easily turning out for a worthy film and they are rewarded because the characters get much better treatment than the facts.  Travolta does well but doesn't manage to be as real as the book's portrayal of Schlichtmann.  Duvall is good while the rest of the cast are very much support but manage to be deep.  When names like William H Macy, Shalhoub, John Lithgow, Kathleen Quinlan, Stephen Fry, Dan Hedaya and James Gandolfini are all in support then you rightly expect it to be a very worthy film.Overall this is a good film that is entertaining.  There is a more powerful, more interesting and moving captivating story at it's heart &#150; anyone wanting that story should read the book.

It is supposedly-based on a true story.Another big highlight of this movie is great performance by John Travolta, perhaps his best work ever. Just the pauses and looks on his face alone greatly enhanced his performance. He was just fascinating. Language-wise, this is pretty tame except for William H.

I've seen plenty of them, as American law system interests me. The greatest would arguably be A Few Good Men... this is pretty much in the order end of the spectrum, being a fairly slight courtroom drama. It has just enough good points to it to keep it above average, but only *just* enough. I think the way the story was told was fairly standard, but good anyway. I liked Travolta's voice-overs, and liked the fact that it's not the typical cliché-like ending, where, against all odds, the case is won. I won't tell you exactly how it ends, but the ending is pretty good, and not as predictable as many of the courtroom dramas are. The plot is good, and develops, at least in the beginning, pretty good, and with a good pace. However, somewhere in the last half, the pace drops and you find yourself being bored with the film. Too bad, since it started out so promising. The acting is very good; Duvall and Travolta are obviously good, but Macy and Lithgow were surprisingly good(not that they're typically bad, though). The supporting cast also do their jobs well. The characters are well-written, credible, and well-casted. The humor, though rare in the film, is mostly good. All in all, a pretty good courtroom drama, based on a true story, and a basic story of inexperienced against experienced, as they say in the featurette on the DVD.

There have been quite a few of them around over the last decade or so but this is one of the better ones. It follows the usual configuration -- the lone hero beginning as a materialist and contracting a bad case of ideals, making sacrifices, risking everything. But in this case it's an entire law firm instead of just one guy, and basically they lose the case.John Travolta, ably supported by Bill Macy and others, is Jan Schlichtmann, a personal injury lawyer (we know what that means) is approached by a woman who, along with eight others in Woburn, have lost children because the drinking water was polluted with toxic waste. He is sympathetic but he demurs, seeing an expensive case from which he will profit only if he wins, and no money in the pockets of the guy who owns the polluting tannery. Then he discovers that the land is owned by W. R. Grace and Beatrice, two mega giant corporations. Between them they own every brand name you can think of. They own Heinz ketchup. Travolta can think of 57 different ways of squeezing $150 million out of them. The scent of pelf sets Travolta's Darwinian points aquiver.But, as they say, pride goeth before a fall. The salivating Travolta brings suit and is opposed by Robert Duvall, playing Jerry Facher. (All of these are real people with real names.) The movie doesn't give Travolta an obvious flaw like Paul Newman's disillusioned alcoholism in The Verdict, but it doesn't hagiographize him either. He has more guts than brains. He gets caught with his pants down a few times when he makes courtroom errors that Facher is teaching his Harvard law students are elementary. (Never ask a witness why, unless you already know the answer. You can learn that from watching Perry Mason.) This Facher is pretty quick on his feet and he clobbers Travolta's character, all the while smiling politely, seemingly distracted, fiddling with pens, wrapping a string absent-minded around the fraying handle of his ancient briefcase. It's a very good performance. Travolta is good too. We never know how serious he is about his motives, or whether he has any idea what they are. He stares ahead and speaks sternly of eight dead children and looking for justice, but at a formal meeting with the two mega giant's lawyers he makes such impossible financial demands that they walk out on him -- and he never discussed his plans with his partners. While the jury is out, Duvall offers him TWENTY million bucks to settle and Travolta oozes dignity as he rips up the offer and tosses it in the trash, to Duvall's amusement. Well, he may seem like Gary Cooper in High Noon, but when you come right down to it he, like Cooper, is playacting. What happened to the interests of his clients? Heroic gestures in the pursuit of self-aggrandizement aren't going to help the families of those dead children living up there in Nowheresville. Stripped of the frame the film tries to give him -- a selfish man who discovers he has ideals -- Schlichtmann becomes not just an ambulance chaser but an ambulance chaser who overreached.In the end Travolta's firm, largely because of his own intransigence, sees the suit against Beatrice thrown out and has to settle for eight million from W. R. Grace. The meeting between Travolta and Sidney Pollack, playing Grace's representative, is hilarious. Travolta walks into the Harvard Club to meet Pollack, carrying a bundle of facts, all business and formality. But Pollack, like Duval, is way ahead of him in every regard. Man, has Pollack got condescension down pat. Pollack What kind of Harvard man are you? Travolta The Cornell kind. Pollack You didn't go to Harvard? Somebody told me you went to Harvard. Don't get me wrong, Cornell's a fine school. (Pause) A damned good school.In the end, Travolta goes back to personal injury cases, his partners split, and he declares bankruptcy (after a two-year vacation -- in Hawaii, which the movie omits). He devotes a lot of personal time to digging up new evidence but has no resources to pursue leads, so he turns the case over to the Environmental Protection Agency, which finds merit in it, convicts the corporations' lawyers of various offenses, and levies fines against them while a heavenly choir rises in the background and there is the sound of Sox fans cheering. That was in, what, 1988? I wonder if the EPA would be so zealous today. Here's an assessment of the present administrator from the organization Earthjustice, a prominent, respectable legal organization. Governor Leavitt's appointment to head the EPA puts an anti-environmental politician in charge of regulating industries that pollute the nation's air and water, said Earthjustice Denver attorney Jim Angell. We know from his history on environmental issues in Utah that his preferred method is to exclude the broader public from the process when he wants to make decisions that could harm the environment.Of course it's good that the corporate giants were made to pay, even if the amount was the equivalent of a licensure fee. And no need to feel too sorry for Jan Schlichtmann. A book about the case made him famous, and this movie made him even MORE famous -- and rich too. He now lives in the exclusive mansion-besotted suburb of Beverly, Mass.It's quite a good movie. Yes, there's a lot of ambiguity to be found in it, if you don't simply accept it as a Manichaean struggle between black and white, but in that respect it resembles real life, which is rarely anything other than fuzzy.

Over an ingratiating orchestra swell, no less. But in reality, good or bad has nothing to do with the outcome of court cases. It's how you play the game. If you can afford to be in the game in the first place.A CIVIL ACTION is based on a real life Massachusetts court case, novelized by Jonathan Harr, about a group of families suing two factories in their Woburn locale, accusing them of polluting the town water supply and causing the leukemia deaths of their children. The factories were owned by corporations, and though a settlement was reached, even as the pittance was being paid out, it broke the back of the lawyer who represented the families and destroyed the spirits of the already-shattered families.John Travolta is lawyer Jan Schlichtmann, who informs us during the opening credits that a lawyer would be doing his clients a disservice were he to get emotionally involved with their case. Then for dramatic arc, and in real life it would seem, Jan went against his own principles and tongue-kissed the case to bed every night and woke with its morning breath in his nostrils every day.Robert Duvall is veteran lawyer Jerome Facher, his doddering, distracted persona disguising a clinical tactician who outplays Jan at every step of the game precisely because he is not emotionally involved. And has no desire to unearth any ethics or truth in the case. When Jan tells him that the families he represents want the truth about the contaminated water, Facher replies amusedly, Are we talking about a court of law? A court isn't the place to find the truth... This case stopped being about dead children the minute it entered the justice system, the minute you filed the case. William H. Macy is Jan's accountant, who helplessly watches the firm go broke against his desperate mortgaging of all their homes as collateral and selling all their office furniture; Tony Shalhoub and Zeljko Ivanek are Jan's snowed under assistants.John Lithgow is the forceful, biased judge, who plays golf with Facher. From the outset, Jan is battling the judge's tripwire impatience as the new guy intruding into this Old Boys' Club.Kathleen Quinlan heads the group of families suing for the truth (one of her sons is dead), and James Gandolfini (THE SOPRANOS would appear literally on the heels of this movie and change his career forever) is a factory worker who harbors damning secrets about the dumping of waste chemicals. In his words - presaging the credo of what would become his most enduring character - I ain't a rat! Jan tell us Odds of a plaintiff's lawyer winning in civil court are two to one against. Your odds of surviving a game of Russian Roulette are better than winning a case at trial. So why does anyone do it? They don't. They settle. &#x85;only fools with something to prove end up ensnared in it. And when I say 'prove' I don't mean about the case, I mean about themselves. In most movies, an eleventh hour revelation drives the Good Guys towards home plate, victory, and that annoying orchestra swell, but in A CIVIL ACTION, even as Jan uncovers damning evidence that would enable him to appeal the case, with an elusive eleventh hour witness, there is no money left for justice to be served. And the law - ironically - stands in the way the long standing principle of res judicata, that a matter once decided in a court of law remains decided - even if that decision flew in the face of reality. Co-written and directed by Steven Zaillian, co-produced by Robert Redford (always into sensible films with something to say), A CIVIL ACTION is a success as a movie precisely because it is such a major downer. It conveys an infuriating claustrophobia, that maddening feeling that we can't, in fact, fight City Hall, no matter what Greg Brady says.Schlichtmann becomes a shell of a man, obsessed with trying to do the right thing, sitting in his bare office with no desk, phones and electricity cut off and no future prospects. And it's raining outside.A late scene shows young punks throwing firecrackers across a river on the contaminated land; one of the firecrackers lands in the river and the whole river catches alight.Movie ends with the Environmental Protection Agency getting involved - one giant institution against another; a clash of the Titans, if you will. In Greek mythology, only a Titan could destroy another Titan; and in the modern obfuscating world of blind justice - does anyone see the irony in that phrase? - it is still impossible for an individual to destroy a Titan, even with the best intentions and the Truth on their side.Harr's book ends on a somber, pessimistic note, but the movie was made after the book, with more current information. Closing text informs us that the two offending corps, Grace and Beatrice Foods, were indicted by the EPA and paid 69 million dollars in cleanup costs. Jan is now representing 60 families in New Jersey in another contaminated water case.Is this guy a sucker for punishment or what?

This is a great movie. It's not your typical courtroom drama, but more of a legal drama. And it's a bit more realistic than what we're used to on the screen (but only a little), and some don't feel comfortable with stories told like it was. (The reason I say 'a little' is because I used to work for lawyers and I can't see any of those guys going that far out on a limb for a case.) But this was a true story and the filmmakers really stuck to the truth. It doesn't have the usual courtroom scenes, yet it still depicts what a hellish, slippery slope (and costly one) it is to win justice for your client in the only venue permitted a court of law. I don't believe there's ever been a film that's told this story quite this way before.I always wondered why our protagonist in the film (that's Jan) took the case in the first place. I always assumed it was forced on him, but don't know where that came from. (I'll probably have to look it up in the book since I don't own the movie.) If it was voluntary, he had to have seen dollar signs in it somewhere. But I don't know because Jan doesn't know. He doesn't even remember the case, let alone why he took it. He sure doesn't remember Anne Anderson when she calls him on the air of a radio show, and asks him why he doesn't return his client's phone calls, which makes him look, sound, and feel like a real jerk.And exactly when he realized Beatrice Foods was Granddaddy to a plethora of stuff that America consumes daily, that's fuzzy too. It's after he's been humiliated on the radio that we see he's got the file and talking to one of his partners about Beatrice Foods' deep pockets. And his partner (I think it was Macy) tells him that kind of case is just a black hole and he should get rid of it. So he goes out to Woburn to meet with the families for the first time (he's had the case 2 years!) supposedly to get rid of them. But after hearing their stories, he can't do it. He's too much of a coward. I also think he's embarrassed by their unbelievable loss and suffering; maybe he feels somewhat sorry for them. But I really believe that the increasing obsession he soon develops over securing the highest number he can for his clients isn't due to a sudden awakening of conscience, or a heart burgeoning with pity, which is what it looks like on the outside. But there's been no character change yet. His anger grows, but it has little to do with the crimes committed by the big corporations against his clients. What really jerks his chain more than anything at this point are those pompous defense attorneys; how they act and how they treat him makes him furious. He's consumed with beating them down and knocking them out of the game for good really because of hurt pride. Jan Schlictman is no hero. One reviewer aptly wrote that he had feet of clay. He's a hot-shot. I wouldn't say he loves the law; I would say he loves having knowledge of the law which allows him to manipulate it, and that gives him power. He doesn't appear to respect the law. We see him getting a speeding ticket on the way to Woburn, and again &#x97; from the same cop &#x97; on the way back. As he takes the ticket and insolently slams it into his glove compartment that's just teeming with others, he resembles a rebellious teenager. And the filmmakers made sure to show us that early in the film.In my opinion, his character starts to change ― and here comes a spoiler ― the moment near the end when he picks up Grace's number off the floor. (That part always kills me!) His partners have read him the riot act and walked out on him. He's sitting on the floor, his body slumped over the phone as he picks it up and dials. His body language reflects utter despair. Note To those who get bored when there's not enough action, and/or can't tell what's happening with a character because there's no dialog to explain, learn to read the actor's body language. If he or she is an above-average actor, (and you are somewhat intelligent), you should be able to get it.As for Oscar nominations, for once I can see why the Academy didn't nominate Travolta for his acting here. I compared this performance with Travolta's take on Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever, and again with Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction. For me, it just doesn't compare. He's not that skillful at the underplaying thing. Robert Duvall's nomination didn't surprise me.Having read the book, I thought the writers accomplished the ending fairly well, even if they omitted a heck of a lot from the book's ending. (It seems to me the families actually did get to testify, but I could be wrong.) There are too many movies that are dumb, pointless, predictable, and a waste of two hours, with too few being clever, absorbing, stimulating, and different. I can never pass this up whenever it's on. But it bores most of my friends, too&#x97; probably for the same reasons others have stated &#x97; no action, no high drama. Also, Travolta underplays his performance for the most part, (which allows Duvall all that scene-stealing) and I think that was an excellent decision for that role, whose ever it was. And whenever an actor does that, sometimes people don't get it; they think nothing's going on, that the star is holding back. Trust me, they did this one right.

His credo is that any lawyer who goes to court has failed, since his job is to settle OUT of court. The first half hour of the film sets up this world of nuisance litigation with a series of brilliant speeches that have the viewer off-center from the usual idealistic young lawyer trying to right wrongs nonsense so prevalent in legal dramas and so missing here. Yet, slowly we watch successful attorney Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta), as he pursues a big company accused of dumping chemicals, slowly evolve INTO the kind of legal crusader we have seen so often seen before, and this way some otherwise familiar courtroom drama takes on a fresh edge and provides greater interest that it otherwise might. And since the drama is based on a true story, it takes some surprising turns especially toward the end, as life often does and Hollywood does less often. An excellent script achievement and a very good resulting film.

I watched this twice. The first time because from what had been described, that's what I was expecting - and I was disappointed. But I decided to give it another chance, reflecting more on the moral of the story and the characters. Using this lens, I wasn't disappointed.John Travolta put on a pretty good performance as Jan Schlictmann, a personal injury lawyer who, although unenthused at first, takes on a case involving environmental contamination that has caused several children in Massachussetts to die of leukemia. Basically, he takes it on because he discovers that there are two huge corporations he could get money from, and that's one moral of the story personal injury law is less about the victims who've been hurt and more about the money that can be made. IN fact, the very opening of the movie establishes that well, as Schlictmann (in a narration by Travolta) describes who the preferred victims are, based on how much money you can expect to make off them, and children are at the bottom of the list. Schlictmann belongs to a small but pretty successful law firm that doesn't accept cases unless they know they can win, since that's the only way they get paid. The whole point of this type of practice, we're told, is to avoid trials and get big settlements. His colleagues doubt the wisdom of accepting this case but go along with it, until Schlictmann loses his perspective in two way he actually starts to care about the victims, declining large settlements because they're not enough, and, faced with a degree of contempt from the big law firms he's going up against, he decides he has to prove himself. The result is disaster. The firm and all the partners go broke, even after a settlement is made, because what they get doesn't come close to covering their costs, and the families are disappointed because they didn't really care about money - they wanted an apology and a clean-up.Although not especially exciting, the movie is well-paced and interesting, and includes a solid supporting cast, including folks like Robert Duvall, William H. Macy and Tony Shalhoub. I found the end a bit anti-climactic. Hard to believe you could feel sympathy for an ambulance chaser, but by the time the movie ends, I really wanted Schlictmann to win. Instead, he ends up totally destitute - telling a bankruptcy judge that he's left with $14 and a portable radio. He wants to continue the case but doesn't have the resources, so he turns everything over to the EPA. They do take the case on - and win - but Schlictmann is long gone by the time that happens.Since this was a true story, it was nice to see the companies forced to pay up, and somewhat uplifting to learn that Schlictmann switched from personal injury law to environmental law. And, as much as I wanted him to succeed in this case in the end, it is a true story, so the end was what it was. A pretty good movie all in all. 7/10 "},{"Title":"John Travolta's Best Movie","Date":"19 December 2007","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" If I were John Travolta, and someone were to ask me which film I am most proud of, this movie, Civil Action, would be my answer.You won't find the kind of climatic courtroom scenes that exist in the fantasy world of typical courtroom dramas. You won't find a chase scene. You won't be mystified by CSI experts. You won't even get to bathe in the Protagonist's heroic rhetoric as he puts Goliath in his moral place.Instead, this movie is all about the little moments. Every actor in this film, including Travolta, takes a script that is good but slightly nondescript, and creates nuance and intrigue in every line, every motion, every action of every character, in every scene.If there were an Oscar for Best Performance by a Cast, this film would have received it.The director and everyone in this film plays this movie true to life and straightforwardly. And yet, it still manages to capture your spirit. It may not get your blood pumping, but it will inspire you. And as good as the other actors are, it's Travolta, believe it or not, who carries this movie.In place of Travolta's normal swagger and scientological ability to seem like he's winning when he's losing, John allows himself to look silly, feel awkward, appear despondent, and even seem weak. He literally allows himself to be upstaged in more than one scene by admittedly great actors but by actors whose persona's are usually, shall we say, less charismatic than his own.The scene where he must meet with the VP president of the opposing law firm is difficult to watch the first or second time you see it. It just isn't funny. But, it's actually quite comical in later viewings when you're not as invested in the plot of the movie.

He never appeared in control of the case, and ultimately went bankrupt because his emotions overcame his reasoning.Maybe one of the themes of the film was supposed to be how difficult it is to prosecute companies who can afford to hire the best lawyers on the planet. If so it was a little too subtle for me.I judge the above based on viewing other legal series / films from the US. Perhaps series like LA Law, Ally McBeal, Boston Legal (any David E.

Don't get me wrong, Erin Brockovich was a decent movie, but when you compare it to this (which is hard not to do), it just doesn't seem to hold a candle.It's unfortunate that this film didn't get the recognition it deserves and that Erin Brockovich is getting recognition that it would never deserve, not in a million years.  There is a pattern that we want our movies to follow, and if they stray from that pattern, it baffles us as audience members, and we write the movie off as mediocre.  Erin Brockovich followed that pattern to the T and for that reason everyone involved is now wealthy beyond their means and America has fallen in love with a movie they've seen a hundred times before.  Meanwhile, there is A Civil Action, a movie that was brave enough to break the rules, and it is almost forgotten three years after it was released.Please, go rent this movie.

The film portrays the limitations and absurdities of this reality well. John Travolta's character (Jan Schlichman) opens the film by talking briefly about the basic types of cases he feels are good and bad litigation opportunities. These are encapsulated as a dead child being the worst opportunity, a dead 40-year old professional white male being the best opportunity. This narration takes place while he is wheeling into court an obviously disabled young man. Additionally, this appearance is *far* from some sort of an example of good citizenry; he's clearly an opportunistic personal injury lawyer manipulating the jury to get the best possible monetary settlement out of the defendant (in that case, a hospital). He's after money, and is skilled at working the jury. This sets our expectations rather high when he manages to get the W.H. Grace and Beatrice case into a trial.I recommend the film.

The 15 minutes of voice-over at the beginning was actually perhaps 45 seconds. I have no idea what he means by his Five Sections theory. It seems that he's not just geographically Out There.This movie needs to be four hours to really do the complexity of the subject justice. Nevertheless, what is presented here is compelling and complex. John Travolta is truly excellent as a chilly ambulance chaser who gradually turns to care--to the point of obsession-- about justice for the families whose children have been killed by careless chemical handling--it's amazing to think that if it hadn't been for Tarantino, Travolta never would have had this chance to blossom. Sadly, though, his transformation, while well shown, is never fully explained. The well-written script stays away from his making a speech about how he's changed, but without it his motivations remain obscure. As he begins to tip into obsession, we are distanced from him by this lack of real internal understanding. This is a problem.Robert Duvall is also just amazing-- it's wonderful to see Duvall and Travolta spar with each other-- as a lawyer intelligent and depersonalized beyond the point of caring about cases as happening between actual human beings. His character is incredibly complex, and his and Travolta's characters, and this film's examination of them, is the film's best feature.The story is compelling, but feels confined and crammed in-- this all but crushes the film as it tries to fit Travolta's post-trial years and the EPA case that ensues into the final ten minutes. It seems to want to leave viewers with a sense of redemption, since the case is finally won, but it suddenly goes so detail-less--when the previous 2 hours have been so rich-- that it just seems limp. A bad note to end the film on.I would have liked the film to focus more on the divergence between justice and the judiciary system, and &#4;Travolta's transformation. I thought this film would have LIKED to do what GORILLAS IN THE MIST did-- show how a righteous obsession can warp someone beyond the confines of reason-- but it doesn't, leaving the transformation a bit hollow.William Macy is excellent in his typical decent man driven to desperation role.

John Travolta plays a lawyer involved in a case regarding toxic waste products contaminating drinking water. Kathleen Quinlan plays one of the folks addressing the issue. A few workers have come forward with information but eventually they are forced to sell out in order to continue the case. Steven Zaillian directs with skill and observation. He previously made another film that touches on realism called Searching for Bobby Fischer. Travolta struggles with this case even at the expense of his career. Robert Duvall plays the sly and clever opposing lawyer who overrides standard material by presenting a cunning sense of empowerment. William H.

Kathleen Quinlan is also well cast and counters standard writing with the willingness to win for a greater cause. Tony Shalhoub steals moments as another attorney. This film presents a message that many viewers can be encouraged by and businesses inspired by. It is an enlightening film about the legal system that inquires that we all take a civil action.

Ambulance chasing Boston shyster Jan Slick Schlichtmann, John Travolta, gets himself involved in a toxic waste dumping case that over the last 30 years has cost a number of children in the small town of Woburn MA. to come down and die of deadly leukemia. At first not all that eager to take the case Jan soon, by checking out the dumping of toxins in a local river, smells big bucks and decides to file a major law suite against the small tanning company own by multi billion Beatricefoods and W.R Grace Chemical for major damages to the people of the town.Right from the start W. R Grace was willing to make an out of court settlement with Jan for a cool 20 million but not apologize publicly for it's actions that leads to a falling out among some of Jan's clients. Who then, against the strong advice of his fellow firm of lawyers, Jan goes the whole nine yards despite the obstacles he faces in going on trial. That in the end leads to a costly victory for him where he ends up going bankrupt together with the members of his three man law firm. It was defense lawyer Jerome Facher, Robert Duvall, who's endless and expensive holding actions in court that left Jan's law firm not only bankrupt but in debt for some 8 million dollars. The saving grace to Jan's self made financial disaster was that finally someone who worked at the tanning plant was willing to talk and thus bail him out of the mess he made for himself.*****SPOILERS**** After almost two hours of suffering through the movie a happy ending was finally on the horizon but by then nobody really seems to care not even thous involved in the law suite. You had to have a Harvard as well as Yale law degree to even grasp what the movie was all about in just how complicated it was with its endless court scenes that never seemed to go anywhere. It was good that in the end justice was done but even those who benefited from it like the major complaint in the case Anne Anderson,Kathleen Quinlan, seemed to have lost, like those of us watching, all interest in it! There's also a pre Sopranos James Gandolfini as W. R Grace employee Al, the father of 8 children, Love who among others breaks the case wide open by finally admitting that the company he works for has been responsible for polluting the countryside and poisoning the people. As for the spaced out looking Al he looked as if he himself was poisoned or on drugs in showing almost no emotion, like a Zombie, in almost all the scenes that he was in!

Anne Anderson (Kathleen Quinlan) embarrasses him to take her case seriously on the radio. There has been 12 deaths over 15 years from leukemia and 8 of them are children in the small town of Woburn. It's an environmental case of bad water and nobody thinks it can be a profitable case. Jan is forced to go to Woburn to drop the case himself. There is a tannery on the river and Jan notices that it's owned by the massive Beatrice Foods. He and his firm Kevin Conway (Tony Shalhoub), James Gordon (William H. Macy), and Bill Crowley (Zeljko Ivanek) file the complaint against the deep pocketed conglomerate. Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall) is the esteemed defense lawyer for the bigger company. Skinner (John Lithgow) is the presiding judge. Al Love (James Gandolfini) may have witnessed some dumping at the plant. Pinder (Stephen Fry) investigates the environment for Jan. The case rests on a knife's edge as money problems mount for Jan and his partners.This is a courtroom drama with some pretty good acting. Travolta does a good job as a smart greedy lawyer. The character is not somebody that is naturally likable although he is the rooting interest. The movie has many great actors doing good supporting roles. The legal drama has the problem that neither side is really concerned about the truth. It's a mystery without a Sherlock. This is mostly a movie of he says, he says. The legal proceedings doesn't have quite that drive. It's a fine court case with 'realistic' cynical lawyers. I'm not necessarily asking for the movie to Hollywood it up. However the movie could start with a young Jan standing up to bullies in defense of somebody weaker. It would show that he had it in him all along, and it would be compelling to see the case reawaken that part of his psyche. I just think the movie sold his cynicism a little too hard. I rather have his cynicism as a hard outer shell for his soft inner real self.

However, it did not do a good job of fulfilling its purpose of a justice film, but instead focused too much on Jan Schlichtmann's struggle with money in courts of law. It was not as much about the people or the environment but about his sacrifices. It was more about working the system and how law works instead of the pain of the victims because of environmental problems. One scene that was moving was when the father described his last moments with his son. It was very saddening to see a grieving father fighting to no avail with big time corporate lawyers. Another scene was when the townspeople were very sad that they did not get their apology. All they wanted was someone to be held responsible, but instead got a low sum of money. The lawyers tried to explain the struggles they went through, but one woman told them how their problems paled in comparison to the citizens' problems. The movie could have been better if it was shorter and more to the point. It could be more focused on environmental justice and the conflicts surrounding it, instead of the struggles of the law firms. We give this movie three stars because it was dragged out for Hollywood and that issues in nature were not shown as much to affect the people. It needs to persuade people to take action against inequality against the environment.

John Travolta did a very good job. John Lithgow did what he does best--whine in a high voice. I'm not sure whether that was appropriate for his character unless that's how the real judge was. But this just happened in one scene. I wouldn't have even known it was him except for that.Two other actors really stood out. William H. Macy really impressed as a man losing control of his law firm as his lawyers stubbornly continue to do what they cannot afford to. Of course, they lose everything in the process. No wonder some people can't get justice--this movie shows the high cost of getting it. No one can pay these lawyers and no money is coming in. They literally lose it all, and Macy effectively shows a man discouraged by these circumstances.But it was Robert Duvall who really made an impact. He didn't seem like a big-company attorney. He seemed like a very bright small-town lawyer and favorite law professor. In fact, one scene shows him teaching a class and showing why students probably wanted to take a class with him. If he didn't at least get an Oscar nomination, I thought as I watched, he was robbed. Later I found out he was at least nominated.You want this man to win. Normally, you root for the people who need justice, and for the most part this movie takes that position. But you don't want this man to lose. And amazingly, he doesn't have to. Remember, there was another company, and no one is going to like their lawyer.An outstanding effort. "},{"Title":"Really good one!","Date":"19 June 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Jonathan Harr's nonfiction bestseller was a shot in the arm for those seeking more than last-minute heroics akin to a John Grisham thriller. Here was a labyrinthine case involving industrial pollution by two highly regarded corporations, contaminated drinking water, and the deaths of innocent children in New England, circa 1981. The case has hundreds of twists and takes our hero--a steady, respectable lawyer named Jan Schlichtmann--and turns his life into personal disaster. Instead of celebrating the law, the story is a maddening and rewarding look at the elusiveness of the courtroom case. Steven Zaillian, who won an Oscar for adapting Schindler's List and directed Searching for Bobby Fischer, boils Harr's 502-page book into a complete, satisfactory film experience. Book readers will no doubt jeer the streamlining Zaillian had to perform to make the movie flow. Most changes can be quickly defused with the exception of the film's portrait of Schlichtmann. The lawyer has been turned into a movie star, an ultra-slick, cold-hearted gentleman who finds his purpose in working the case. Casting a stalwart John Travolta again diverges from the book, which right from the opening pages showed us a Schlichtmann with feet of clay. As Schlichtmann's partners (including William H. Macy and Tony Shalhoub) descend into the case, the unbridled sense of power and money is abandoned. This case is ultimately about survival. Zaillian provides an excellent narrative for the sordid facts of personal injury suits, in which money is the only reward for lost or broken lives (deftly introduced in the film's opening scene). Zaillian also stays away from dwelling on the illness of the children involved, focusing on the gaunt faces of the parents who survive (Kathleen Quinlan, James Gandolfini) in controlled anguish. His evil characters--an industrial plant's owner (Dan Hedaya) and a corporate lawyer (another fine acting spin by director Sydney Pollack)--are so human it's terrifying. Zaillian's final ace in the hole is Oscar-nominee Robert Duvall. Perfectly cast as Travolta's opposition, Jerome Facher, Duvall steals scenes with the abbreviated dialog; he turns a fancy settlement meeting into a farce with one line. Facher is not a callous, love-to-hate-him lawyer like James Mason in The Verdict. Facher represents the law at its brilliant foundation to best represent one's client. With a taped-together briefcase and dry humor, Facher, not Schlichtmann, is the character who captures us by the film's end.

The problem with this movie is that the plaintiff's case is so weak that it undermines the theme of the movie. Here, the victims do not triumph until the federal government agrees to resurrect the case. Hence, the movie should have been about the heroics of the federal attorneys to compel the defendants, large corporations, to settle and take responsibility. This notwithstanding, the movie still makes a number of good points regarding the nature of litigation, especially as it relates to its cost. However another problem with this movie is that it portrays attorneys themselves as being victims of system that can quickly bankrupt all but the largest and most well-financed law firms. The case itself gets lost in the story and the actual victims, the plaintiffs, are marginalized as the process itself takes center stage. The John Travolta character is an attorney whose competence to handle such a complex case is repeatedly tested with negative results making it difficult to have empathy for the character who basically is simply messing up. He makes mistakes that are so egregious that this movie could have been subtitled How to Lose a Case Without Even Trying.

Well written, well directed and with a whole host of good performances, from reliable actors like John Travolta, William H Macy and John Lithgow among others.But Duvall is delicious. He plays an experienced trial lawyer, who is brilliant at his job defending companies against damage claims, but his brilliance is very un-obvious. In fact, he goes out of his way to appear very ordinary the crumpled suit, the cheap briefcase, the homely baseball-loving ways and his affected offbeat mannerisms (This is a good quality pen.) He is in fact the kind of character who would make anyone want to be a lawyer (and I hate lawyers as much as the next guy!) But I digress. There is more to 'A Civil Action' than this.

At the time environmental torts were novel -- one example of how general scientific acceptance of an idea colors the burden of persuasion. In this case, the burden of persuasion was insurmountable, and Schlictmann calculated incorrectly that he needed to spend on the technical preparation heedlessly. From an environmental torts standpoint, if this had happened today, the result would likely have been different; the standard for establishing this type of cause and effect, with the evidence they had, is more forgiving today. I thought the movie adaptation was very good. Having read the book, the way the movie depicted the financial ruin of a law firm was more vivid than I had imagined. I agree with another review on this site; everything about the way the movie was executed was well done, the cinematography, wonderful portrayals of Judge Skinner, Jan Schlictmann, his partners, Anne Andersen, Al Love by James Gandolfini (wow! unbelievable performance - watch his eyes) both opposing counsel, especially Jerome Fascher -- all gave subtle and memorable performances.

This must be a pretty good film if I could sit through endless commercials for Enzyte, the male enhancer, and some kind of Charles Bronson film festival to be showing soon, and come back to the film, which as with most movies on AMC did not take up quite where it left off.Travolta was made to play a negligence lawyer. He reminded me of Ricky S, a man who shared my offices back in the '80s and who followed the Travolta dictum to the max. All of Ricky's cases were settled on the telephone. I liked the way he talked before he thought; he exuded that confidence that such men have to have to do their jobs, and when he realized what he missed in the spilling of the glass of water, he took it as a new learning experience to add to his arsenal.Duvall was his customary excellent self; we have seen him play this role so many times, but it could have been filled by Gene Hackman also. I think Duvall can mail these parts in. I am not being negative either.I did not realize that William Macy's character's LAST name was Gordon. I liked the way the storyteller did not cut to scene's showing Travolta's associates doubts about what he was doing, but let us draw our own conclusions, and I cheered when the writers and directors did not tack on a The Natural ending by having Travolta hit a home run in the courtroom.Then there was Gandolfini he could have been sitting down with AJ, Meadow and Carmella at the dinner table. Same facial expressions, same little tics, same inflections in his voice, yet he was real.One little inaccuracy came when Travolta sat down with Pollack in the Harvard Club. Pollack asks, Well, what do you want and Travolta pulls out what seems to be a settlement offer. Pollack admonishes him that business is not done in the club......but later in his office, when essentially Pollack asks the same 'what do you want' question, Travolta fires back that he does not want to negotiate against himself, the correct tactic.

He accepts the case, but soon finds himself in deep financial troubles, because this case costs a lot more than he could afford. Nevertheless he keeps defending them and does as much as he possibly can to win the case. Most of the time court room drama's are pretty decent movies and that's why I give most of them a chance.

He is a true crusader whose motives are almost certainly altruistic.  He is great in this part.  The script and the production are very good too, unfortunately this movie was not widely released.  John Travolta plays a classy Beacon Hill lawyer in Boston.  His firm comes across a case where a factory appears to be poisoning the local water supply, and in general hurting the environment and certain people are covering it up.Robert Duvall plays the lawyer for the said factory.  The movie is very much a battle of wills as John Travolta matches up with his nemesis who understands Travolta, and even sympathizes with the young idealistic crusader a little bit.  The two are very different.  Travolta is a young upstart still learning how to be a lawyer, while Duvall is a seasoned lawyer who has years of experience behind him.  What is fascinating is watching Travolta's character go from a very ritzy person who seems oblivious to the working class to a crusader that (SPOILER) fights for those that have suffered almost obsessively.  I also liked to see John Travolta taking on the establishment.  He took on a number of high powered lawyers, business leaders and people that in general viewed him in a very negative light.  He took them all on.  He lost, but that was not his point.  It is amazing that the man went bankrupt, and convinced his two partners to almost go bankrupt as well taking on thisThe supporting cast is excellent.  Tony Shalhoub and William H.

The book was much more intriguing and sentimental than the movie. The lawyers and families put their lives on hold and sacrifice everything to fight for this case in hopes of proving that two companies caused the pollution in question.The case in Woburn, Massachusetts began with one woman's suspicions. Anne Anderson discovered her son, Jimmy, had leukemia in the summer of 1966. During the time Jimmy was being treated for leukemia, Anne began to talk to people in her neighborhood. She soon heard of two other cases of childhood leukemia only a street away from her. Anne began talking with one of the mothers, Joan Zona, because her son had leukemia as well and the two women became friends. They discussed the incidences of leukemia in their neighborhood and both agreed that it was a strange coincidence, but Anne became obsessed with the idea. She discovered several other cases of leukemia and began to analyze why this was happening. Anne started worrying about the water in Woburn, which had not tasted good since two wells, called G and H, were drilled and began pumping water into eastern Woburn in 1965. Complaints began pouring in to the city of Woburn regarding the quality of the water and the rusting of pipes, thus causing wells G and H to be shut down several times. However, the wells were not shut down for good until much later. Anne expressed her worries to her family doctor, her church minister, and her husband. Anne's husband and doctor listened to her suspicions, but did not believe they had any validity.The situation began to heat up in 1979, when an inspector tested the water and reported the results to the environmental department in Woburn.   Can of worms!Schlichtmann was a young, enthusiastic lawyer who had only recently begun practicing. Jan was determined, stubborn, and self-destructive. He enjoyed living lavishly, and he loved the law. When he was given the Woburn case, he did not begin working on it right away because his partner, Conway, among others were trying to convince him not to take the case. The Woburn case was referred to as a black hole because it appeared to be a very complicated case to win, but Jan decided to pursue it anyway. He met the families, and then began to investigate W. R. Grace's land and Beatrice's land for contaminants. Trichloroethylene, or TCE, was found on the land, and the case set into motion. Harr's A Civil Action tells the story of one particular case, and by doing so he shows the reader every step behind the process of a civil trial; from deposition to trial. Harr describes the judicial proceedings of the Woburn trial in exquisite detail while making the legal terms and actions clear to the average reader. Although A Civil Action is a true story, it also serves as a legal learning tool for many. Harr enlightens the reader by showing that a case is not always as it appears to the public eye.

The human body can go longer without food than it can water. But what do you do when the water you need to survive may be killing your children? A small town in the North Eastern part of the United States faced this very problem in the 1970s.	John Travolta plays Lawyer Jan Schlictmann in this movie based off a true story. Jan is the hottest young lawyer in Boston. He is a personal claims lawyer (some would call him an ambulance chaser of the highest degree) with a thriving small practice. He is one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in Boston. Jan will do anything to win a case. He has his own personal equation as to which person will bring in the most money from a trial and thus fill his pockets the deepest. The client he desperately wants to avoid is a dead child as they are worth the least in a jury verdict. 	Everything is going well for Jan and then a case with at least 10 dead children drops into his lap. This case is known as an `orphan' as it has landed in every prominent lawyer's office and all have passed on it prior to him. Jan meets with the families to give them a personal `No thank you.' While there he finds of their suspicions as to chemicals that have been dumped into the ground and poisoned the water supply. What interests Jan the most is the parent companies behind the dumping. Suddenly a no interest case becomes one which could net him millions.	The rest of the movie deals with Jan's obsessive involvement with this case. How it raises him to an almost unheard of prominence and dumps him into the lowest levels he has ever been. 	John Travolta does a good job in this role. He can play the ultimate of arrogance and also the most wounded of individuals as he grows to learn more about what life is truly about. William H. Macy is Jan's financial affairs person who is desperately trying to keep the firm afloat as Jan's obsession causes them to spend more and more. John Lithgow is fine as the Judge. Robert Duvall is great as the opposing lawyer who gives Jan a lesson in legal theatrics.	The movie is well done but a little slow at times. Definitely would recommend it as the performances by all move this one. **3/4	  "},{"Title":"Really works as a legal thriller","Date":"18 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  In A CIVIL ACTION, John Travolta plays a hot shot shark of a lawyer who comes across a civil suit that tests his humanity.

He was a pompous, money hungry man who happened upon a case that he thought would change his life. And it did, just not in the way he expected.Children in Woburn have been dying of leukemia. The consensus opinion is that factories have been polluting the river, which is causing the well water to become contaminated. At first Schlichtmann doesn't want to take the case. But when he finds out that two large companies with deep pockets may be involved, he sees dollar signs in his eyes. But things don't go the way he planned. Eventually he and his partners end up penny-less and he ends up bankrupt. The parents of the dead children didn't want money, they just wanted an apology, something they never end up getting. But in some ways, things end up for the better. Or do they?It's hard to fault a movie for creating bad or annoying characters, when the characters are based on real people. From the moment he stepped onto the screen, I didn't like Schlichtmann. I didn't like his attitude or what he stood for. It doesn't help that Travolta just naturally has a pompous I'm better than you look on his face. I didn't like Robert Duvall as the opposing lawyer. I didn't like John Lithgow's portrayal of the judge. But I realized after a while that I wasn't really supposed to. This is what happens in real life. This wasn't a typical Hollywood courtroom drama where all of a sudden a witness cracks on the stand and everyone goes home happy. Schlichtmann went for the gold and ended up with almost nothing. He says he'd do it all over again, but I'm not sure if he would. If he knew that he'd end up bankrupt, I don't think he'd end up doing it all over again. He was a money hungry, no morals kind of lawyer. The only reason he took the case was for the money. Even by the end of the film I didn't believe that he had a moral turnaround (although the postscript said that he became an environmental lawyer).If I had to find fault with part of the movie, it was the fact that we never got to know anyone else in the film. I realize that the story was to be about Schlichtmann, but I think it would have helped to get to know other people. There was only one scene where we got to hear the story of the children's parents. We never got to know the other lawyers in the firm. For a court case that was centered on dead children, we only got to see one lawyer. I thought the movie could have been a lot better had we gotten to know more of the story surrounding the case, rather than just one man's view of what happened.Overall A Civil Action was an interesting story, but one that wasn't captivating. The performances were almost non-existent only because John Travolta was front and center the entire time. As far as being a courtroom drama, most of the action took place outside of the courtroom. For all the talk, I thought it would be better.

As far as movies go, I'm pretty easy to please.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie I disliked this much.  I've never commented on a movie before, but I had to say something about this horribly boring film.I really like most John Travolta movies, I love movies based on actual events, and I think it's hard to make a bad courtroom drama.  This movie had a lot going for it.  I had a group of people over and we rented this, and almost everyone fell asleep.  I wish I had-- it would've been a much better use of my time.  Everyone else I've ever talked to about this movie had nothing but groans and complaints.The basic storyline was a good one.  The actors were decent, for the most part.  So where did it all go wrong?  The screenplay and the directing. This moved SO SLOWLY!!!!  Still, I have patience.  I continued to watch, expecting a really gratifying finish.  I can endure long exposition if it means a great payoff at the end.  Well, I waited, and waited, and waited... and then the film ended.I forget how long this movie was (because it seemed to drag on for hours), but I truly think it could have been made to be only half as long.  For example  At one point John Travolta is asked a question.  It is not a mind-boggling or deep question... it is nothing he needs to think over. Yet he pauses, stammers, and finally replies some lame response about a full minute later.  The entire movie was like that, where I just kept thinking, Come ON!!  DO something!  SAY something!  ANSWER THE QUESTION ALREADY!!!! (I really wanted the movie to end.)  I don't fault the actors-- with the entire film paced like that, it was clearly the director's choice.I write this review only for those of you thinking of watching it.

Although remaining fairly faithful to the book, A Civil Action does take some liberties by adding more humor and, oddly enough, eliminating a lot of the emotional elements that made the book such an exceptional read.By focusing primarily on Schlictmann's prosecution, and Jerome Facher's defense team, the film doesn't leave much space for a heart. Only two of the victim's families are portrayed as more than just cameos in the picture. Both families have heart-wrenching stories and provide the backbone to the film. It is too bad only two such stories are shown, and in such a brief manner. A Civil Action goes out of its way to portray the legal process accurately, while, at the same time, making sure the film moves along at a decent pace. It's fun to watch the way a lawyer thinks, the games he plays in the courtroom, the manipulative tactics performed on the judge and jury, witnesses and anyone involved even slightly with the case.If you want to see a courtroom film with all the trimmings, this is the one. It adequately blows away the contrived John Grisham tripe that we've been fed for the past decade in legal thrillers. If you'd like more than just a touch of humanity thrown in with your courtroom thrills, you may want to pass this one up and hope for something better next time.

John Travolta is a perfect choice to play Jan Schlichtmann, the egotistical, free-spending attorney who dives headfirst into a damages case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace, who are accused of poisoning the drinking water of Woburn, Massachusetts and causing a leukemia outbreak.  William H. Macy, Tony Shalhoub, and Zeljko Ivanek co-star as Schlichtmann's partners in the firm, and one only wishes that they would have protested his actions, which led to the financial ruin of him and his firm.Robert Duvall gives another terrific performance as Jerome Facher, Beatrice's attorney, who is the complete opposite of Schlichtmann.  In a scene at a fancy hotel conference room, the frugal Facher is not impressed by any of the lawyers or their arguments, but the free pen that he can take home.  It's a subtly funny scene that illustrates Facher perfectly.  John Lithgow does a terrific job as Judge Walter Skinner, who Schlichtmann believes is siding with the enemy.A Civil Action is a story where the winners and losers are unclear, and it must have been difficult for writer-director Steven Zaillian to condense Harr's technical-laden novel.

I haven't seen the script, as originally conceived, but supposedly Travolta's presentation to Duvall of the condemning evidence is delivered in tandem with the baseball fans' increasing excitement over  the game.

A Civil Action, co-written and directed by Steven Zaillian, sports one of John Travolta's finest performances since Pulp Fiction.Travolta is Boston injury attorney Jan Schlichtmann who is one step away from ambulance chaser status.  A case is passed on to his small law firm (a passed case like this is called an orphan) regarding the deaths of some children in the northern Massachussets town of Woburn from lukemia.  The parents strongly suspect the lukemia was brought on by the improper disposal of hazardous waste from two of the towns factories.  They fear the drinking water is contaminated.  At first Jan wants no part of the case.  But he begins to feel in his heart that there is something more valuable than money.  As the film progresses, we watch his emotional transformation from greed to empathy.  (If this character sounds vaguely familiar, it's because Steven Zaillian also wrote the screenplay for Schindler's List.  And, like Oskar Schindler, it isn't what is said, it is what is done.)The film is well paced and every scene is necessary for the development of the characters and plot.  While watching A Civil Action, it struck me that this was more a character driven film than a story driven film.  That's not to say the story isn't important.  I mean, how exciting is any civil court action?  In reality, most people fall asleep while listening to civil court arguments. Wisely, Steven Zaillian didn't keep us trapped in the court room listening to testimony regarding soil samples and chemical compositions.  Rather, he created realistic and well defined characters with a lead who has an emotional learning curve to negotiate.  I was especially taken by Robert Duvall as slightly eccentric but sharp as a tack opposing lawyer Jerome Facher.  Duvall seemed to eat up this role.  However, my personal favorite scene was with excellent character actor Dan Hedaya as owner of the tanning factory and defendant John Riley giving part of his deposition to Jan Schlichtmann with a glass of water and Jan's expensive wood conference table.  Riley oozes loathing for Schlichtmann. A Civil Action is a well directed, solid character film with very realistic dialogue, an excellent cast and an outstanding performance by John Travolta.

Brilliant Tony Shalhoub is wasted, playing essentially a warm body. Equally brilliant William H. Macy should have had so much more to his character, but I'm thankful he got as much as he did. With the exception of Duvall's amoral yet immensely likeable corporate attorney, the rest of the cast is more or less forgettable.A Civil Action is snazzily filmed, and its contribution to legal drama is in the depiction of the spending siege that allows corporate plaintiffs to win through settlements (which contribute to the image of the money-grubbing injury lawyers). But Travolta is wooden, preventing us from caring much for him, and we really see very little nefarious machination by the multinationals named as responsible parties for the contaminated water.Had it been Inspired by a True Story instead of based on one (that is, had the writers enjoyed more leeway to fictionalize the story), odds are good that we might have seen a truly indignation-inspiring film, on the order of The Accused or Romero.  As it is, we are mildly miffed at corporate irresponsibility, and we leave feeling as if this is the worst sort of naughtiness big companies commit.By no means an awful film, merely disappointing on too many counts.

Remarkable isn't it.Travolta has made an art form out of smoking. The fingers are this way or that way, the cigarette turned in or out. It's different and distinctive in all of his modern films (I'm not sure about his faggin' style in the likes of Grease, Saturday Night Fever or as Vinnie Barbarino in Welcome Back Kotter)But in A Civil Action he doesn't light up at all. Another first!In fact he ends up so squeaky clean in A Civil Action that I thought that we might have been going to see something really new and have his lawyer with a heart launch into a Steven Segal speech about how we now need to look after the environment and not even smoke cigarettes. But no Travolta just went dumb. The cat got his tongue.In A Civil Action John Travolta plays Jan Schlictmann a hot shot personal injury lawyer, an ambulance chaser.He takes on a case against a couple of companies who apparently have poisoned the water to a small town where a number of children have died of leukaemia. The film is based on a book, apparently based on true events which took place at the start of this decade - although we really can't believe everything we read in promotional material.The opposing lawyer is played by the always excellent Robert Duvall and the plot is well, confusing. This is largely because apparently in America lawyers can drag in witnesses  in front of the opposing law team,with no judge or court in place, and demand answers. Then they do a deal and mostly don't even go to court.Once we Australian's figure that out then we're faced with the fact that it appears that big chunks of the tale seem to be just left out of A Civil Action. But that's all OK really because A Civil Action is so utterly predictable for 99 percent of the movie that you or even I could have written the script over one or maybe two cups of coffee. The other 1 percent must have been by accident.Segal would have made a 60 second speech about the planet's ills.

I'm surprised Zaillian, who did such a good job writing SCHINDLER'S LIST and writing and directing SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, would stumble like this.  The movie becomes more about the process of the case and less about the case itself, and the film used too many shortcuts, like how Travolta's character ultimately decides to take the case.  And even though the movie focuses on the trial, we don't get a sense of how Travolta and his team really lost the case themselves.What it did show did have its good points.  Duvall is good as usual, and it's nice that he and the filmmakers didn't turn him into the stereotypical evil lawyer.

It's been out for almost a month, and (following promising trailers and much pre-release hype) there has been not but a word regarding this film. Playing in one small theatre on the outskirts of the Village, it appears almost as if this recently dubbed sure-fire Oscar contender has now been forgotten.  If this truly is the case, then it is a shame, as A CIVIL ACTION is unarguably one of the much better films of 1998.Having read the varied reviews of the movie on this page, it wouldn't seem unlikely that this comment might be met with a shocked or negative reaction and/or response.  Before I am simply dismissed by those who may not have liked this movie, then allow me to explain.  Granted, this movie is not the greatest film ever made; it's far from it.  The film does have flaws. However, this is a potentially astounding movie. In other words, while the movie is good, it has the potential to be incredible, as is the book, so I hear.  Like most movies that are based on books though, It is probably not as incredible as the book and that could cause for a considerable amount of disappointment for excited fans.  In addition, hopefully differing from the book, some parts of the script are an enormous let-down.  Many lines were, as they have done recently in most major films, dumbed down for cheap laughs.  This, I attribute to society, or rather the lack of a civilized society.  The producers, or writers or movie hierarchy feel the need to dumb down the lines for mass audience appeal.  This takes so much away from an otherwise well written film that is perfectly acted and contains a powerful message and story.In addition, John Travolta's narratives seem as though they are not always, or rather, not completely necessary.  Though I do understand the choice to keep these in the film as they set-up his character as the stereotypical uncaring personal injury lawyer.  However, that was set up in other ways, and as such the voice over narratives simply became redundant and took away from the movie.These flaws, among others the needless cameo by Kathy Bates, the sometimes annoying overture etc. etc. etc., disappoint, as all who read the book and/or saw the well organized trailer were expecting a flawless film.  Thus these flaws keep the movie from being incredible.  However, one cannot ignore, the numerous pros the movie has to offer a breakthrough, surprisingly emotional, performance by John Travolta, who had not been expected to perform so well in such a role; powerful cinematography (who can forget the image of the boy dying in a car on the side of a road in the rain, with his parents attempting desperately and vainly to restore his life); and an incredibly acted supporting cast of Robert Duvall (with a chillingly real performance), William H. Macy, Kathleen Quinlan, and even, yeah why not, Tony Shalhoub.  Unlike, most movies of today designed simply to trigger an emotional response, this one has a delicate story behind it, and a damn good one at that.  Travolta's fine acting (I can't believe I just wrote that) contribute oh-so much to the story as we follow the protaganist who is simply unlikeable! (I may be inclined to add a supposedly before the unlikeable as today the unlikeable main character is usually who the audience seems to enjoy. I again attribute this to our society's degraded state)  However, as the movie progressess the we start to see his character subtly change as he gathers feelings for his case, building up to the moment he finally pictures the dying son on the side of the road and decides to sacrifice all for the clients' benefits.  And when we get to the film's end, we are surprised to find we are rooting, actually hoping and dealing with this man's inner conflicts, for the man whom we had at the film's beginning so despised.  Again, Travolta's acting helps greatly to convince us of his inner turmoil of dealing with his clients' loss or his own losses.Then, we come to the ending.  This movie could have had our hero win, but no, integrity prevailed and an unbelievable success story so often spewed out by Hollywood was NOT produced. No, the anticlimactic ending, while creating mass disappointment in the audience (so much so that they may not have liked the movie?) was very befitting.  After all, lest we forget, this was an unlikeable, evil character.  Shouldn't he get what he deserves? This IS his payback for never caring.  But unfortunately, it is at the expense of good, suffering people.  And the irony, he figures out what happened, only after losing everything, only after nothing can be done about it.  But even in the sadness and disappointment in Travolta's failures, it offers a glimmer of hope, in that the case may be tried again.  But....they may meet with the same result as Travolta did.  It goes to show thought, that there are others who care for the little guy, and others who are willing to fight.  This bitter-sweet ending makes up for previously giving in to mass audience appeal with trite dialogue.In the end, this movie does what it's supposed to do, it tells a story, in detail, with all of its ups and downs.  And the movie does not try to make you feel good, no, it shows you the downside and degradation of the world we live in, following the tradition started by Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER.  This movie does that.  We await in suspense, hoping that Travolta and his firm can win the case for these people and get their money back.  We are left entertained, always fearing the inevitable failure that his firm will lose; either the case or their money or both, thus providing a nice juxtaposition with THE RAINMAKER where you were rooting for a good guy for a good cause going against a bad guy and a bad cause, and then having the good guy win. Still, you can't help but root for Travolta's bad guy with the good cause. I just can't see how you can be bored by the story being played out. The great cast, fine acting, and flawless story combined with well organized direction create a potentially incredible film with a powerful message leaving the audience emotionally affected.  You can not help but be drawn into the movie by this story.  Sure, it's not the best film out there, but all these great factors combined make A CIVIL ACTION a powerful movie.  Most movies of 1998 didn't dare stray from the hollywood norm of happy endings and weak storylines.  But this one does, and pulls out all the stops in its efforts to create an amazing film for the ages.  One factor I attribute to its failure to become one of the greatest is once again the degradation of our society.  We cannot appreciate what this film tries to do.  But it tries nonetheless. Thus making it, one of the best of the year.

There are better courtroom drama's out there, for you to see. This one lacks the bite it needs.Performances. John Travolta does what he can, but his character is so unlikable, I had trouble relating to him. Robert Duvall adds class to a rather classless film, but that's about it. Rest of the big name cast, do OK.Bottom line. They should have named this Civil Actionless because there isn't much suspense or interesting drama to be found. Perhaps there is another audience for this film, but i'm not apart of that audience.4/10 "},{"Title":"A Civil Action","Date":"22 April 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The case in Woburn, Massachusetts began with one woman's suspicions. Anne Anderson discovered her son, Jimmy, had leukemia in the summer of 1966. During the time Jimmy was being treated for leukemia, Anne began to talk to people in her neighborhood. She soon heard of two other cases of childhood leukemia only a street away from her. Anne began talking with one of the mothers, Joan Zona, because her son had leukemia as well and the two women became friends. They discussed the incidences of leukemia in their neighborhood and both agreed that it was a strange coincidence, but Anne became obsessed with the idea. She discovered several other cases of leukemia and began to analyze why this was happening. Anne started worrying about the water in Woburn, which had not tasted good since two wells, called G and H, were drilled and began pumping water into eastern Woburn in 1965. Complaints began pouring in to the city of Woburn regarding the quality of the water and the rusting of pipes, thus causing wells G and H to be shut down several times. However, the wells were not shut down for good until much later. Anne expressed her worries to her family doctor, her church minister, and her husband. Anne's husband and doctor listened to her suspicions, but did not believe they had any validity.Now, after reading the book, it became apparent to me that, the book was much more interesting and intriguing.

That is until he finds that the probable culprits are owned by two major multinational companies. Now he can go to court! Comments Not a very entertaining movie, more so an interesting one. A terrific cast spearheaded by Travolta, strongly supported by Macy, Shalhoub and Duvall, among others. They all give very good performances, but the entertainment is almost left out of the script.Based on a true story, it seems (the true story is unknown to me) that the movie keeps more or less true to the events and has dramatized very little. That is most evident as we come to the end. The events leading up to this is suspenseful enough. The legal troubles, the financial troubles and the personal struggles within the law-firm, all of them build up to what could be a magnificent end.But that magnificent would have to be dramatized, and most would say it would be a Hollywood-ending and fault the director/writer for making it.

And then they made it so that the townspeople wanted him to continue the case even though it was clearly bankrupting him (apparently, in the book they wanted him to blow it off).Other than that, it's an acceptable movie.

The script is poorly executed, often resorting to cheap laughs when it has nothing of any further intelligence to say. Pointless and vapid, the lack of plot development is unnerving and frustrating.  I was minimally excited by the first twenty minutes of the film and, when i realized it was not going anywhere, I tuned out and turned a jaded eye on the whole travesty.To see John Travolta chew scenery with dimply arrogance is just not my idea of a good time.  When Travolta is handed a good script and an able, actor-minded director, he does good work (ie Pulp Fiction and Quentin Tarantino.)  However, he still missteps a great deal of the time. Supporting actors have underdeveloped, contrived roles  William H. Macy is mildly disappointing, as are Kathleen Quinlan, Stephen Fry, John Lithgow, and Tony Shalhoub (able actors all.)  Their characters are written so weakly that even decent actors, as they all are, cannot rise above the Hollywood monologue-for-a-dime formula.  James Gandolfini, who plays one of the very few intriguing people in the film, disappears instantly (and quite literally) in a glass of water.  Robert Duvall is notable even though he too seems like a cartoon and an exaggeration.  I find it disheartening to watch a movie with so much acting talent, so squandered.Uninvolving and unexciting as a flat roller coaster, the film fails on a number of levels.

Grace and Beatrice. Duvall, who plays Jerome Facher, experienced and smart, says that it cannot be proven. The movie was written and directed by Steven Zaillian, is not your typical courtroom drama. As a madder of fact, not a whole lot of the movie takes place inside of courtroom walls. It does not follow the conventional and tiresome formal of the hero loosing a first, the comes from behind and whips the bad guy's butt. What it does do is follow a realistic and surprisingly thought provoking idea of Travolta's law firm going father and father into debt, and how the lawyer gets in over his head in emotions and financial problems.The performances in the film are spectacular. John Travolta's character is very well portrayed as he gives us a taste of what our legal system suffers from. John Lithgow is sort of cheesy as the judge, and coming fresh from TV's Third Rock From the Sun, I didn't have much faith in him in the first place. Tony Shalhab recently from The Siege, acts with little confidence, or was that just his character who was supposed to be meek? I Don't know, it's hard to tell. The real standouts here are Kathleen Quinlan, who performs with emotion and physical reality, and Robert Duvall, who was nominated for best supporting actor of the year for the Golden Globe award board, as he deserves to be.  The moral in A Civil Action is relevant and correct. But it is back shot from the film's characters, who were supposed to interrupt, being the bad guys in all. But if I was in charge of this movie I no doubt would have directed with more sharpness in the depressing finish of the movie. It is not satisfying and disappointing. The soundtrack leaves us with a sort of Blah feeling. However, if the trial was to be won to our desire, and the courtroom was to all stand up and cheer, the film would have been conventional and we would have left feeling we have already screen this film. So in other words, this movie was fine the way it was directed.A Civil Action, is a well-promoted salvation in the fast-falling genre of courtroom dramas.

Historical appearances in Grease and Saturday Night Fever and then he came up with something like Urban Cowboy. More than a decade later he comes up with Pulp Fiction and now this.... Let me tell it like it is  this was actually one of the dullest movies I ever saw.... Aaaaarghhhh, here goes the story.... Travolta is a succesfull lawyer who only defends for the money till he meet a mother whose child died from cancer which was formed by the polution of some leather factory. Of course in pure Hollywoodstyle the lawyer sells everything he has to defend a lost case and after 10 minutes you know you have to watch 100 minutes of crap to know how it will happen... I really hate movies that are based on true stories as they all are so preaching. I know very well that factories choose for money the moment they are asked to decide between health and production, therefore I don't need to see this crap.... Quite shocking to see that this is directed by Steven Zaillian, a man who is normally screenplaywriter and he did...Schlinders List, Mission Impossible, Hannibal, Gangs Of New York.... You cant blame the actors, Travolta does his job and the appearance of Robert Duvall as the evil advocate is the sole reason why you aren't fallen asleep "},{"Title":"Boring!!! This movie sucks!!!!","Date":"6 November 2001","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I was reading the comments about this movie and noticed that somebody (who is obviously on some serious drugs) commented that this movie was alot better than Erin Brockovich. WRONG. Erin Brockovich won an academy award for a reason and this movie won NOTHING because it doesnt deserve anything. Erin Brockovich was FUNNY and CREATIVE and had GREAT acting. This was one of the most boring, uneventful, lackluster movies I have ever seen in a theatre. I had a really hard time staying awake. So what if this was a lawsuit who cares the story of it was told very poorly.  There is not one even remotely interesting scene in this movie. The script was dull and bland. Skip this one. 3/10.

A film which was so slow, stretched tedium to its limits, and combined a truly pathetic story with some insipid acting left you wishing Travolta would give up his case and free the audience from their ordeal. Although there are some fine actors in this film, notably Duvall and Travolta, they could do nothing to save this mediocre script.

Then I saw it. Must have been a hundred still shots of a glass of water.  Yeah, after the first couple, I got the point.Then the end.  Sitting in the theater, and reading the messages on the screen that describe what happens later, without resolving ANYTHING, I just said WHAT?!?! and I can't believe I just wasted 2 hours and $15 on this. out loud in the theater.  I wasn't alone.If you want to see something like this, only much better.  See Erin Brockovich. "}]
