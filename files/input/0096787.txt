So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.

Often very dark and frightening at times. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation buffs. But do keep a tissue in handy.

When I was a kid, I used to watch this every other day. It is underrated if you look at its IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This isn't a bad movie like many say, it is a very good movie. This is good and your kids will probably like it. Even though it's rated G, some parents may find this to be a bit violent. It is actually a pretty dark story, where the dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling, extortion, and even cold blooded murder. The movie follows a dog named Charlie who had escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up coming back to earth. Many younger kids watching this movie may feel as though they are watching a big kids movie. There are some scenes that may scare little kids, but I'm sure they'll do fine. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a little kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last movie that a little girl named Judith Barsi was in. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn't deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can't watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds so sad. The animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is good, but a little bit different from many other kids movies. This was popular at the time of its release, but was over shadowed by Disney's mega popular The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that isn't conceived as well by adults, but if you're a kid, or if you grew up with this movie as a kid, then I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.

The other day I was babysitting and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies. So many memories came back watching this movie once again and I have to admit I even cried a little. I'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most touching animated films and I'm shocked honestly by this rating of 5.8, I thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well. I admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun.Charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge he comes back to Earth with a watch that can't stop ticking or that's the end of his life again. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spy on him they find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes fake promises in order to get the money. But he ends up learning that maybe he should put Ann-Marie first before himself when Carface goes back to him with a vengeance.All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect family film, it's not Disney, but this is an excellent family film to watch. Not to mention that it's just so cute and touching. I know it's ridicules and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They're just so loving, and I think I'm going to cry again.

Yes, All Dogs has plot holes; Charlie can't talk to horses but can talk to alligators, the bad guy is allowed to enter heaven and the story is overall confusing.So what?This is one of the few movies that managed to make me feel, in the true sense of the word. Have you ever been sad and hopeful at the same time? All Dogs made me feel that way. It makes me smile every time I watch it -without even knowing why-, and occasionally makes me cry. All Dogs has one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen in my life. The art is sublime; the characters' expressions, the backgrounds and special effects are astonishing. The symphonic and jazzy musics rolling in the background make whole with the 30's atmosphere. The dialogs are all fitting where they should belong. There are so many things to tell about this movie... I've noticed that many reviewers have been disturbed by the unusually dark tone spilled throughout the film. In real life, people are able to drink, gamble and/or kill. Don Bluth seems to be one of the few directors that takes children seriously, and present them the not-so-bright sides of life.For those who are unsure about watching All Dogs or not because of some disturbing interpretations of the movie; Give it a try. You'll either hate it or love it to death, but one thing is sure you won't be seeing anything like that in the near future. This is one of the strangely addicting movies that you love without knowing why (see also Six-String Samurai and The Man Who Saves The World to see what I mean).

I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once. Carface was even better than he was in the All Dogs go to Heaven sequel.

At the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes. This movie deals with more serious issues, and therefore has a little more emotional impact.

Isn't it? No. It is NOT. All Dogs is an original movie with a story-line completely unlike anything Disney would do. This is pretty much a cartoon tragedy, about a starring character who isn't even a nice guy. Robin Hood (1973) starred a thieving character, but he was a nice guy, risking life and limb to help the poor. Charlie (marvelous voice of Burt Reynolds) is a thief who would like to help himself to some pizza and a run of success in gambling.All Dogs is a sad story that depicts the canine underworld, a dog-eat-dog world of exploitation, lies and murder. Charlie is, as the rest of the dogs say, a dog with a record. In fact, Charlie gets run over... and this not being a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, he dies. But, of course, if he didn't miraculously return, this would be a short featurette. The way he returns is so original, and so dominant in what happens later on, you simply can't see how the writers ever dreamed it up. The story is spectacular and certainly a strong point, but that's not where it ends. The animation is mindblowing. Although not like The Secret of NIMH, it is still breathtaking, beautifully drawn and moves smoothly. The characters look like they're talking more than in many Disney cartoons. The effects, all hand-drawn, must have been extremely tedious to work on, what with sparks, explosions, powerful electrical charges, nightmarish visions of Hell reminiscent of Fantasia's Chernabog character. The characters, too, are unlike others. The usual story of an animated movie (actually, any movie) would be the righteous hero versus the evil villain. Sometimes, the hero isn't all he seems, but he comes round soon enough. In All Dogs, the battle isn't hero-vs.-villain, it's villain-vs.-villain, thief-vs.-thief, except we're supposed to sympathize with one of the combatants. We eventually do come to root for Charlie, and boo Carface. In such movies, the hero/thief is a nasty guy who's frosty at the surface but a good soul at heart. Charlie, by contrast, although not as evil as his partner-later-to-be-enemy Carface, is a bad guy who stays bad even after he's been betrayed. He deceives little Anne-Marie to get some money. Instead of the hero inside surfacing at last, Charlie's is a wholesale transformation from bad-at-heart to good-at-heart. That is extraordinary, and special. Plus, he has a wide assortment of friends, from a small but courageous dog to an opera-singing alligator, always helped along by a bunch of faithful dogs unlike Carface's thugs. These friends, however, rip off One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) by acting exactly like the dogs in that Disney movie's Twilight Bark. This isn't a genuine act of idea robbery; how the hell WOULD the dogs communicate, by mail?All Dogs Go to Heaven is one of the more complex animated movies. It involves stuff that will fly right over the head of little ones or traumatize them, like being eaten alive by bloodthirsty fish. It's more adult-oriented in its true theme and its true meaning, but kids will love it for the funny sidekicks, but they will also cry till their eyes are dry over the ending, that is one of the most emotionally powerful tragedies you've ever seen. Or is it? After all, all dogs go to Heaven.

It tells the story of a roguish German Shepherd mix named Charlie B.

With the help of his hyperactive, flea-ridden best friend Itchiford Itchy Dachshund (Dom deLuise),and a adorable little orphaned girl who can talk to animals (Judith Barsi), Charlie embarks on a fantastically animated, highly original musical adventure of self discovery and right of passage.Maybe I am biased since it is one of my favourite movies, but I think this is an underrated movie. The characters are realistic and relate-able, as well as charming, funny, and fantastically acted - you truly feel for and understand them. Ann-Marie, the orphan, is as believable and lovable as a cartoon girl can get. The story is riveting and complex, but in what i think is an engaging and compelling way. The soundtrack can be out of place at times, admittedly, the best song being Let me be surprised, and the most bizarre being let's make music together, but I'm sure many ADGTH fans will agree it's the strangeness makes the music so wonderful and, um ... sing a longish.The movie is rather dark, but children could watch it with adult supervision. The messages may be mixed at first; is gambling good or bad? Is drinking always a fun time? Alas, the message is pure - you always do what's right in the end, and that's what makes you who you are; but you MAY have to do the wrong thing to see that. It's a realistic message, which is why it may stand out to many kids - doing the wrong thing will lead you into trouble, but life is a learning curve.One last word for you all, esp. to lovers of ADGTH, and that is ...

The ending is my most memorable part of this movie, how for a moment Charlie comes back from the ether to give his final goodbye to Anne-Marie and his faithful companion Itchy before he has to finally disappear into the night to face his fear. It's a real tear jerker that comes about with many people who have witnessed death first hand, with visions in the night and visits from anon, it's something you can relate to and I feel it is the best way to conclude such a magnificent film.Another point with the film is that it adds a bit of Noire to it, tales of conning, murder and other threatening themes does make this movie different from most mushy kid films which try to dampen down the violence and other adult themes to the point of non-existence. Here Bluth has taken it almost to the limit of the PG rating but does it in a way that makes it acceptable. Also there are some really good musical numbers in here which (if you've watched Bluth's later works), are probably his last. Overall, this film is a grand piece of work and a real high note for a great animation director, although what followed next was much more disappointing. But as long as Bluth's better years as a director are summed up with films like this and Secret of Nimh, then the useless films that followed can be put in the cellar with the rest of those bad movies.

It's a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a misfit German Shepherd called Charlie (fantasticaly voiced by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss/partner in crime (is name ha,ha is Carface). Charlie is sent straight to heaven by default because all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind. Chalie gets sent back to Earth 'cause he winded up his life clock where he gets into even more mischief with his best friend, Itchy and a little orphan girl, Anne-Marie.

My parents never purchased the movie for me, but I think I'll go about and buy it now. I'm a sucker for pre-2000 animated films. Anyway, onto the actual review.WHAT I LIKED There was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in animated films. Character development existed! It's easy to classify characters in this movie (i.e. Charlie is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical but believes Charlie, Carface is obviously the relentless villain, etc.). I also loved King Gator's song. I've always loved loud, annoying, flamboyant guys. This song may have been random, but it was so fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could tell Charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE The actual portrayal of heaven The way Charlie reacted to it, no surprises whatsoever, made it actually seem very boring. He denied a place in heaven and STILL got to return to it in the end. I remember a few lines of certain songs such as ... you can't keep a good dog down, ... let's make music forever, and ... welcome to being dead but I can't remember the majority of any of them. The songs weren't that catchy, to be honest. Whippet Angel She's annoying and that NECK! AUGH!WHAT PARENTS MAY NOT LIKE A few very scary (depending on the viewer) images of Hell are shown during the movie. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implied, but not actually DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element in the movie. The good guy dies.OVERALL I LOVE this movie, even if it is a bit forgettable at times. The scarier children's animations are always my favorite ones. This was created back in a time when producers and writers weren't afraid to give kids a little scare now and then. Nowadays, this probably would have been rated PG. Kids under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed kids) should not watch this. Other than that, I give it 9/10. )Happy Viewing!

Others we don't get an opportunity to see until we're much older. With this movie, I fall in that second category at the age of 24. To be honest, I don't mind having missed this as a kid, but that doesn't automatically make it a bad thing. I've seen better and worse than this as far as animated movies go.All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie heavily centered on dogs, like The Secret of NIMH for mice and rats, Legend of the Guardians for owls, Finding Nemo for aquatic life, and Madagascar for a lion, zebra, hippopotamus, giraffe, and a group of military penguins. The main protagonist is Charlie, a happy-go-lucky carefree dog who goes through a plot I've seen before, done better and done worse. His plot is one of change, as in, he must change who he is to become something better. He does this through a little girl named Anne-Marie, who is actually a lost girl, but also smart and kind. To see such a change with Charlie through this little girl is heart-warming, but there were some parts about it that were cringe-worthy, so it wasn't all perfect.Then there's Carface, the villain. From the beginning, he really is more annoying and stupid than anything else. He makes harsh decisions for making the sake of making harsh decisions, he is a hypocrite, and he never thinks, blaming his stupidity on his subjects. His motives, or lack thereof, make him a lazily written villain and so Carface easily becomes my biggest gripe about the movie. However, the rest of the cast more than make up for Carface's shortcomings.The jokes and songs don't always land, but when they do, and they do often, it helps the plot of the movie and also make it better in itself. There sad scenes in the film were heartfelt and genuine, so it works. Being Judith Barsi's final film, the fact that the film dedicated so much to her memory, including the ending theme, was a very nice homage and I'm sure she is feeling honored watching this in Heaven even to this day.I wish I could give this film a higher rating, but Carface as a villain is a problem I cannot overlook and there were parts of the film I felt dry, so I'm stuck with giving it a 7. But it is still a good movie and worth a watch. "},{"Title":"Dog-Gone it! All Dogs go to Heaven is a pretty good movie.","Date":"27 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Drama","Review":" In the 1980s former Disney animator Don Bluth gave Disney a run for its money with such hits as 1982's The Secret of NIMH, 1986's American Tail, & 1988's Land Before Time. Then in 1989, All Dogs Go to Heaven came out on the same weekend as Disney's Little Mermaid to try to put the death blow to Disney. What Bluth didn't know, is that Little Mermaid would spark the Disney Renaissance and he would find himself, for the next several years, playing second fiddle at the animation box office, with one last hoorah with 1997's Anastasia. While, Mermaid was indeed a blockbuster success, All Dogs Go to Heaven wasn't a failure. It had a good opening at theaters, but better sell in VCRs tapes than Disney that year. The movie tells the story of 1939's criminal dog, Charlie B. Barkin (voiced by Burt Reynolds) whom finds himself getting murdered by his business partner, Carface AKA the dog version of 'Scarface' Al Capone (Voiced by Vic Tacback). When Charlie to find himself in bored in heaven, he steals a magic life-watch and rewind it, so that he can relive his life, from the point of his murder. He goes back to earth to seek his revenge on Carface, with help from his best friend Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise) & a young gifted orphan girl, Anne-Marie (voiced by Judith Barsi) who has the power to speak to animals. The movie's title come from the movie concept, but could had derived from quotes ranging from Robert Louis Stevenson to Mark Twain about what life is in heaven in which Bluth got the idea from. The movie plot is similar to 1934's Little Miss Marker, also known as The Girl in Pawn. After all, Anne-Marie doe looks like an mix between Snow White & Shirley Temple with a lot of Barsi added to it. The movie has a lot of crazy violence, language, drinking, and dark frighten hell imagery that might be not for all children. The movie was actually supposed to be a little darker but they cut the hell scenes and change a tommy gun into a ray gun to get the G rating. It does have some great moral lessons, here about being honest, loyal and understanding love. The movie also has a great spiritual message that some people might love. The idea of heaven here is pretty open to all faiths as it doesn't single out, any one type of religion. Still, some people do believe that All Dogs go to Heaven is about the spiritual journey of humanity through all the stages from the book of Genesis to the New Testament. Let me example it, like Adam, the original man, he was born without original sin and able to live in Paradise. Since dogs are virtue in nature based of the movie, Charlie is able to live in Heaven. Like Adam, Charlie is cast out of heaven, when he steals the watch, which in this case, represent life or the apple in the bible. It wasn't until, he choose to be more Christ-like; he was able to come back to heaven. While, I do believe it's an interesting concept. There are some plot-holes in this interpretation. One might point that that Dogs in the film, already had free-will, and the whole argument of dogs being like original man isn't well-framed. Also, some people believe animals don't have souls, so there isn't a heaven for animals. Other has point that, animals would exist in the Kingdom of Heaven based on scriptures of Isaiah 116-9. Still, this really does make it, more complex, when the bible has a lot of negative things to say about dogs. The reason why dogs signify unclean in the bible is due to the fact that dogs eat unclean things. From this, others religions or cultural tradition outside the church control were often deems as evil dogs. To make it worst, bits of the bible also deem homosexual, women and other races as evil dogs. To some Christians, people that are deem dogs would never go to heaven in the bible. What I love about this movie is saying that all dogs go to heaven. If dogs are an allegory to human in this film, than that means nearly everybody should go to heaven. Even murderers like Carface got to go to heaven. Still, it was a bit odd, to see dog's hell play a big part in the film, when it barely has any dogs going there. While, most people might deem the Big Lip Alligator Moment as little to no bearing whatsoever on the plot. In an odd way, some people might see this as a symbol of homosexuality being welcome by new beliefs of Christians. Some view it, as homage to 1933's King Kong. Other view it, as Voodoo Witch doctor falling in love with a zombie. What-ever. It's just there. Another theme that seem to be running around is child abuse. Carface routinely mistreat Anne-Marie. It's really hard to watch, when you find out how much Barsi was physical and mental abuse in real life, before getting shot by her father before this movie came out. The voicing acting is alright. Reynolds & DeLuise really have chemistry, due to them previously appeared together in a number of films. The singing and music numbers weren't that great. 'Let Me Be Surprised' & 'What's Mine Is Yours' proves that Reynolds isn't a good singer. 'You Can't Keep a Good Dog Down & Let's Make Music Together was fun, but mediocre. Love Survives dedicated in Barsi's memory was pretty beautiful. The film inspired a theatrical sequel, a television series, and a holiday direct-to-video film, that weren't that good. Overall The animation is beautifully done, but the overall style is grotesque and disturbing. The bittersweet ending didn't help at all. From an artistic standpoint, I think it's a pretty amazing example of animation, but it's not something for all children. Still, it's worth watching.

I would watch it over and over till the VCR messed the tape off and even then I would want to watch it more. Now as I'm older, it brings me back to those happy little days even if it does show how old it is.The story itself is a little cliché in that it's about a 'guy' who was on the rough side of town and ends up getting a second chance to make up for his ways. On the other note, it really isn't that cliché as we have a bit more to it. I use the word 'guy' loosely since its about a dog who needs a shock to turn his life around, namely dieing. When Charlie comes back, he isn't a whole new person like most stories tend to go. His personality is pretty much the same with a little more revenge mixed into it. It takes a little girl to show him what is inside his heart, cliché I know, but actually rather believable.Most of the comedy that we get is the interaction between Charlie and Itchy as Itchy is sort of played off as the 'playful' sidekick that really does get kicked around a lot. The way the two interact makes you think there is a bit deeper bond like they might have been friends at a different time. You can speculate a lot about the two characters backgrounds since they don't really tell you what the back story is. I would have loved to get a bit more understanding into who Itchy is since all we got was the rather clumsy and silly sidekick. The only characters we really got personality wise was Charlie and some of Carface. I say some because other then him being a douche bag, there really wasn't anything else to his character. He didn't care about his subordinates, he didn't care about the little orphaned girl he had pretty much locked up, and he sure as hell didn't care about Charlie. All he cared about was himself.The artwork definitely shows signs of aging from the slightly grainy look to the sort of dark painted back grounds. Still, if you look at a lot of other shows around the time (Legend of Zelda The animated Series&#x85; Yuck) it still looks really well done. I fell in love with its sort of dark and dirty look at New Orleans back allies where you push to survive.The voices are really awesome except for when they are singing. I feel like a lot of the songs are really like Iago singing but it doesn't hurt my ears as bad as that. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise do really nicely as Charlie and Itchy for the most part though the script doesn't do really good conveying what is going on. I have a small feeling that it's because of how old the script is.I fell in love with the show even through all its small problems. Most of the problems are only because of when it was made so I still think it's a rather good show.

Wanting to take all the earnings for himself, Carface frames Charlie and has him sent to a pound, but Charlie escapes with the help of his best friend Itchy, a nervous Dachshund (voiced by Dom Deluise at his funniest). The two of them arrive back at the casino in the middle of a rat race, and celebrate their breakout with the catchy as heck musical number You Can't Keep a Good Dog Down.But Charlie still believes that he and Carface are partners. Eager for 100% of the profit, Carface and his neurotic sidekick Killer (voiced by Charles Nelson Reilly) get Charlie drunk and then kill him by running an automobile over him. Charlie shoots straight into the sky and lands at the pearly gates. He arrives in what appears to be the sort of Heaven that a child might imagine, located in the clouds, where everyone floats around and is dressed in a robe with halos above their heads, and where lions are resting with lambs. A Whippet Angel there explains to Charlie that all dogs naturally go to heaven because they are inherently good, unlike humans. But because Charlie has spent his life being a gambler and drinker, he is unimpressed with heaven and how everything is orderly and pre-planned. He sings Let Me be Surprised, in which he complains that he wants to go back to earth where he doesn't know what's going to come. He cheats his death by stealing his life watch, a glowing pocket watch, and winds it up, allowing him to return to earth. For a place that knows everything that is to come, they sure didn't see that coming. Through the rest of the movie, the angel's voice coming from the watch says You can never come back, a very haunting and unsettling line. Back on earth again, Charlie reunites with Itchy and plots his revenge on Carface to ruin him and make him suffer slowly and painfully.You know, for kids!So as Charlie sneaks into an air vent to enter Carface's basement, he finds him there talking to a young girl named Anne-Marie (the voice of this character was Judith Barsi's last performance). It turns out she has a rare ability to speak to animals. Carface has her held against her will so she can talk to rats, giving him an advantage when betting on races, which are apparently rigged so that those who speak the rats' language can know in advance of the outcome. Carface keeps making promises to Anne-Marie that she can go outside the basement, but breaks them. Being an orphan, Anne-Marie is sad and lonely.When Carface leaves, Charlie rescues Anne-Marie and plans to use her in the same way Carface does. He says that in return he would help her find a mom and dad, though he has no intention of doing so. A memorable seen takes place the following evening when Charlie, Anne- Marie, and Itchy sleep inside a taxi at a landfill. Charlie is eager to get Anne-Marie to fall asleep so he can talk privately about his plan with Itchy, but she keeps getting up and asking him things such as Can I sleep here? or May I have a goodnight kiss?, to which Charlie is annoyed and more smacks her with is tongue than kisses her. She also prays to God, thanking Him for Charlie and Itchy, which is a bit confusing since the Heaven we see in this movie appears to be nondenominational. So the next day, they go out to the park to grab a few bucks from someone's wallet to start their betting, while Anne-Marie is just searching for a pair who might adopt her. As she introduces herself to a young couple, Charlie snags the man's wallet and takes Anne-Marie away. And before long, Charlie makes out like a bandit at horse races and other events including---kangaroo boxing?Soon, Charlie has his own bar and casino built. But when Anne-Marie becomes upset that he hasn't used any money for the poor, Charlie decides to stay to true to the promise. So he brings pizza to an abandoned church where a litter of a puppies are cared for by a collie named Flo (voiced by Loni Anderson). The pups start fighting over the pizza, leading to Charlie singing a sort of Jamaican song about the values of sharing. I guess the writers had to add in a message for young children, as the main theme of the movie is more adult.So Anne-Marie finds the wallet that Charlie stole from the man and sees the couple's wedding photo inside. She goes up to the church's attic to sleep, and sings a Somewhere Out There-like song, in an audibly different voice I might add, about how soon she will find a mom and dad.Though this movie isn't as dear to my heart as The Land Before Time (I admit I watched this one fairly recently), it's pretty good. Burt Reynolds was awesome as the voice of Charlie, giving him the charm of a con man, and in fact all the voice acting is excellent. The animation has the dark texture of The Secret of NIMH and the outstanding background details of The Land Before Time. The pacing does grow slow in the middle, but it all builds to the movie's truly moving conclusion.

The characters are well developed and the artwork is good, and the music is of a terrific quality, with most of the atmospheric music in this instance provided by the late Ralph Burns, whose work with Woody Herman, Ray Charles...and countless others over a career of nearly six decades, makes the film very lively. The film had a Damon Runyon quality about it that I really liked. I immediately empathized and sympathized with Charlie, the German Shepherd, who has had a life of tough breaks and who winds up being murdered by the very ones he has come to call friends. I really like the way Charlie is drawn and characterized...he is a credible guy. The performances are good, as is the story.

For me, though, I really like it, even if I noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bits. The animation was actually excellent, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi.(I was physically ill when I read what happened to her) Also, Carface is a very convincing villain,especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback(I particularly loved Morons I'm surrounded by Morons) and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains. Charlie and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the film is very haunting, like Annabelle's You can never come come back, which kind of scares me still. Unfortunately, there were some bits I didn't like so much. The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. Also there were some dark scenes, that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very poignant. However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. None of them in particular stick out, with exception of Let's Make Music Together and Love Survives, and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing. All in all, a watchable movie, that could have been more, but is definitely memorable, and I would definitely watch it again. 7/10.

Gambling, drinking, death, guns and Hell are all prominent in the plot, and though kids will get very little of it, adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie. The actual movie isn't explicit in any way, it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie on.Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog, who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (A dog....getting drunk...in a kid's movie. It just sounds weird.), Charlie is tricked and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven, he finds a way to come back to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in Heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise), and plans payback on Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a little orphan girl Anne Marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals, which helps predict races. Charlie and Itchy free her, and try to help her find a family, while learning a lot about themselves.This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation, while adults will enjoy the nice, sweet plot, and the more than normal developed characters. One thing that keeps this down, is that it's a musical. Normally, that's a good thing, but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump around, almost sounding ad libbed, with next to no instrumental backing. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but luckily, the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes.The ending of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel made to this was, I wish the ending wouldn't have warranted a sequel and it would've wrapped up into a nice, super happy ending.

There was (get this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character), plot development, superb animation, emotional involvement, and a rational, relatable, and consistent theme. If not for the handful of song-and-dance routines, you would never have thought this was a kids movie, and this is why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent film, let alone for a kids' movie. Which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids' movie I've seen in quite some time, this coming from a 22-year-old. I'd be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie, and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across (ala Jurassic Bark, for those of you who are 'Futurama' fans), and this is what makes this movie so good. Just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don't normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad; in fact, it means it succeeded. Good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh; good horror movies are supposed to make us scared; good sad movies are supposed to make us sad. My point is, good movies are supposed to MOVE you, not simply entertain; this movie moved me.Also, this movie is incredibly violent by today's standards for a kids' movie and contains subject matter that, by today's standards, may not be suitable for some children.

This movie isn't just for kids and it's far from ordinary. It was set in New Orleans in 1939. First and foremost, the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film, but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with.In the beginning, Charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner, Carface. He is money driven, greedy, and just escaped death row, as he states in the start of the feature. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and his sidekick, Itchy. Carface will not even listen to the fat, ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him.Carface attempts to murder the hero, because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and won't settle for only 50% - a highly unusual way for a German Shepherd mix to die. Also, being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not. This is a cartoon, and that's why it is logical here.Carface's method of revenge is through murder, while Charlie believes success is the best revenge, financial success that is. After surviving death, he starts a business by taking Carface's source of financing, a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals. They win a whole bunch of races, and Charlie tells her he'll give the money to the poor - hint hint Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard, and are therefore poor. He uses the money toward his casino/bar/theatre, and not the other poor. The reason why Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion, and she listens carefully. She teaches Charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling, lying, and stealing. Charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses. She added the ethics that his business needed, while Charlie did management, and Itchy provided construction.Carface uses violence and property damage to tear down Charlie's business, which is unprotected by the government. Charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl. In the end he had to choose between her life and his own. He first grabs the watch out of self preservation, and sets it down when the girl started to sink. Both the girl and the watch were sinking, and he had to choose which one, and he chose the girl.The great part about this movie that focuses on a person's ability to learn right from wrong over time, and a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet, is that it never shows anyone dying! The watch symbolizes his life, and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped. All the deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. I didn't cry during this movie until now, and I have gotten so much more out of it, that I had to write it down and share it with you.

The third act is where the climax of the movie is and you want to know what will happen to the main character. The second act does have a sort of light hearted element to it, but for the most part nothing exciting happens. This is a film that I recommend for older viewers, with 12 being the absolute youngest age to be watching it. Mainly because of the villain and the sort of dark elements. The villain is one of the best villains ever simply because he managed to kill off a main character and is willing to make sure the main character stays dead.

Offering some of that same unique aesthetic which made his Secret of NIMH so appealing, Bluth takes this rowdy kids feature and blends it with dark atmospherics that help create the memorable surroundings where a criminal canine world is thriving.The animation is obviously not as fluid as modern eyes are used to, though the painstakingly detailed, hand drawn backgrounds retain more charm then anything created by computer in the last 15 years. There is a certain warmth emitted from this style that hearkens back to a day when cartoons actually used to be pure, and had none of the compromising marketing techniques thrown in to gather wider audiences, as mega-budgeted cartoon franchises pander today.The small but heartfelt supernatural story which explores the doggy afterlife of one street dog Charlie will remain a classic animated film for years to come. Overshadowed by some of his other work, Bluth still manages to prove why he is so highly respected in the business with nearly every concentrated frame. What does tarnish the film a bit however, is All Dogs Go to Heaven's insistence on breaking out into song every so often. The original music, and the voices who sing it (particualrly Burt Reynolds in the lead) are pretty awful, and noticeably sinks the film from being uniformly well received. The entire pacing may as well feel alien to young kids brought up on today's animated features, but for those willing to appreciate a time when hand drawn art was approached with more sensitivity in the American animated world, All Dogs Go to Heaven is a nostalgic treat.

His first production, THE SECRET OF NIMH, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day. This was followed by AN American TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both of which were made under the involvement of Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful. Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of NIMH, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups. But before long, Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID.Considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare. Instead Bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder. That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children. On the other hand, it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN. In short, it's a movie with a major identity crisis.Set in a dreary junkyard of New Orleans, the movie starts out when Charlie B. Barkin, a rough-and-tumble German shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigar-puffing pitbull, Carface. Before you know it, Charlie finds himself in heaven, albeit by default. Here a whippet angel, Annabelle, tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind. This line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.Upon realizing that he's been murdered, Charlie steals his way back to Earth and plots to get even with Carface. With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy, Charlie rescues Carface's prize, AnneMarie, a human girl who can talk to animals (in order to predict who will win the rat races). Charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring Carface down. Although he refuses to admit it, Charlie does grow to love AnneMarie...The concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution. Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes of Ken Page), none of the other characters emerge as likable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about. Unfortunately, that also applies to Charlie; in trying to make him an anti-hero, the script (composed by more than ten writers) only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable. As such, the audience feels no empathy for Charlie, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing. (Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds.) Besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story. The slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time. The aforementioned musical alligator (who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where Charlie tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza. The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster (AnneMarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from Ken Page's mellifluous vocal) or the uneven voice cast. As mentioned, Burt Reynolds' stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end). Dom DeLuise as Itchy is pretty good, but he's had better roles, notably Tiger in AN American TAIL and Jeremy in THE SECRET OF NIMH. Ken Page, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best. Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson (as a collie who once sired a litter with Charlie), Melba Moore, and Charles Nelson Reilly. Judith Barsi as AnneMarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show.Barsi aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation. Technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from Bluth's team (by 1980's standards, that is), particularly a frightening scene where Charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon. If anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.On the whole, however, I cannot recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment. Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as Bluth's better efforts. Animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry, but by the time it's over, ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth.

I saw the secret of NIMH, Bluth's other animated venture, and thought that a film about a canine going to the great pound in the sky might be worth a night's viewing.Well, I bought a copy to have, saw it, and wasn't sure what to make of it. It was one of the most odd children's' films I had ever seen. Other animated films had a kind of grounding, but this film seemed to be really out there. That, and the animation by Don Bluth standards, wasn't all that good. It was decent, respectable, and passing, but not in line with his usual work. The facial expressions were great, but the entire film seemed more than just a little dark. I read that someone else stated that the colors were rich. I'm not so sure that that's the phrasing that I would use in this instance. Again dark comes to mind.We have a tale about a dog who indulges in the seamier side of life. His values are to get ahead by placating to desires of character weakness; gambling, drinking and so forth. He gets his break by stealing away a young girl superbly voiced by the late Judith Barsi. Reynolds, his then wife/companion Loni Anderson, and on screen friend Dom Deluise voice the key elements in the film, accompanied by the ever talented Vic Taybac playing the heavy.I didn't take a shining to it then, but, being a dog lover, I decided to hold onto a copy, but I had real qualms with the content. It's not a film that I'd take any child to see, nor would I even really recommend it to the adult animation enthusiast. Even so, it has marginal entertainment value.Watch at your own risk.

He's made certain great movies like The Land Before Time, and certain awful ones like Rock-a-Doodle, and exactly in the middle of that spectrum are movies like... this one, which is just weird and doesn't feel suited for either kids or adults. It's certainly an imaginative and complex movie, but that's not really a good thing in itself. Some of the scenes are wild and wonderful, particularly Charlie's escape from heaven and his descent into hell, and some are just insane and annoying (the giant witch-doctor alligator in the sewer). Most of the scenes are extremely dark in tone for no reason. But the worst aspect of this movie, like all of Bluth's lesser work, is that none of it makes any sense. It gives us a 1940s-style mafia made up of dogs, and they somehow coexist with 20th century humans while knowing how to drive, shoot pool, etc... what in the hell. I'd really like to know what the brainstorming sessions sound like at Bluth Studios.

For me, it certainly wasn't a casino-owning dog getting murdered and coming back from the dead for revenge, then again, if you're one of those lame adults who finds something in talking animals and that my dog is my fur-child nonsense, you might enjoy this. Myself, I thought this was like tripping and seeing some very strange hallucinations that made no sense.For a movie made in the late 1900's you'd think they'd be able to get facts straight. It's not the Great Depression anymore, orphan children rarely live in the streets with patches on their clothes.The dog, named Charlie, could speak to an overweight alligator, had a wiener dog sidekick, the animation was almost as bad as the plot and the soundtrack was bad and really weird. The whole heaven concept was unnecessary and lame. To make matters worse, they add the hell stuff in, which really isn't appropriate for a children's film. There are names of some of the animals make no sense, like Carface and Itchy.I'd never watch this thing again if you payed me, to put it bluntly.

It's awfully dark for kids and offers nothing to entertain adults. Perhaps it's just me, but an animated movie aimed at kids that features gambling dogs, revenge, the death of a dog (twice over, if you could Charlie's death at the beginning) and orphaned little girls is not what makes an enduring animated classic. In addition to the story problems, the music was completely charmless and the animationwas murky and stilted. I would not recommend this to very sensitive children or anyone who doesn't want to be depressed or disheartened by their cartoons.

The fact that it deals with the afterlife and dogs getting involved with organized crime might make some parents concerned. Well, this 1989 animated film is not a Walt Disney Pictures release so there's its excuse for being different right there. United Artists is releasing this one and the studio took some chances with releasing such a film to the family oriented market. However, few people noticed since the film was released around the same time as Walt Disney Pictures mega popular animated film The Little Mermaid. Rent The Little Mermaid over this one. Considering the talent involved (Don Bluth, especially), the animation in this film is a major disappointment and it winds up being strictly for the dogs rather than for the kids.

The dark and dreary attitude DOGS make may have fit nicely if we were not forced to like most of the characters, particularly Charlie, from the beginning. Plot holes and inconsistency are everywhere. The characters are unique but not appealing. Nothing works in DOGS but a bit of charm that shines through.With help from his buddy Itchy, Charlie breaks out of the pound and gets back to the night life he created with his old partner Carface. Carface planned on getting rid of Charlie from the start and has him killed. Charlie escapes Heaven and plans his revenge by stealing Carface 's ace in the hole, Anne-Marie an orphaned girl who talks to animals.No one except for Anne-Marie is likeable. The charm that she brings out in the other animals makes ALL DOGS shine a bit. But past that, this movie is boring and may go over kids heads. The songs are just as rough as the movie. The story drifts especially toward the end. A dreary movie from beginning to end, ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN gets two thumbs down.

Who knows why? He created two lovable classics, The Secret of Nimh and Land Before Time. It's inconceivable that a man who created two fantastic animated movies could also create such awful animated movies. Yet besides those two, most Bluth movies are poorly executed, saccharine, and undramatic. All Dogs Go to Heaven deserves to be at the lower end of the spectrum. Right next to Rock-A-Doodle. Here, we get the same Bluth trademarks--confused storytelling, poorly executed script, sappiness, lack of true drama, etc. Bad characters and a story too sappy for adults but too scary for kids makes this movie even worse. A Bluth fizzler so bad it hurts. Avoid.

It isn't exactly the best film I've ever seen but it does have an interesting idea. A dog somehow dies and goes to heaven. Charlie (voiced by the sometimes annoying and silly movie star Burt Reynolds) dies in some kind of accident (or is killed by Carface the villain, I can't remember which) and he goes to heaven. But he somehow gets out of it and goes back to Earth with warning that he may not return to heaven after jinxing out of it. Charlie is just selfish and gambles and stuff, this annoys the little girl a lot. This is okay I suppose, the kids will obviously like it. Okay!

Almost as bad as when Disney followed the Lion King with Pocohantus. I don't know what the script writer was on when he came up with this movie, but it must have been pretty bad cause this thing is almost totally incoherent.This is an overall annoying movie, but the two most irritating features of All Dogs go to Heaven are the amount of continuity errors and the little orphan girl.  These features are related because for some reason, the writers didn't think it would bother anyone that Anne Marie is able to communicate with animals when the animals can't talk to each other... MOST of the time (Charlie can't understand the horses, but he can hold a conversation with the alligator).  It doesn't help that any time Anne is on the screen, I cringe.I'm giving this movie a 2 only for it's parody value.  Otherwise, All Dogs is pretty much cartoon hell. "}]
