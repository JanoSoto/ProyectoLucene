I won't go much into the plot, but it involves a news woman who gets attacked while in a porno shop viewing room. To get her mind off things, a psychiatrist recommends she goes to his private retreat to be treated. After that, spooky happenings and strange deaths start occurring. This film has great direction and great atmosphere and mood. The lighting and use of fog is excellent and really hightens the spookiness of the film. One of the best werewolf transformations is shown in this film, rivaled only by the one in An American Werewolf in London. Although this movie starts out slow, the tension keeps rising and keeps you interested in what will happen next. The spookiness doesn't always lie within the content but also the claustrophobic feeling and the uncertainty of who you can trust. A very good movie, highly recommended.

The 1970's gave us Alien, Jaws and the Exersist, but we had lost the creepiness of the classic Universal monster films, such as Dracula, The Mummy and (my personal fave) The Wolfman. Pop culture had come to know the werewolf as a guy that hadn't shaved in a while and grew fangs. Joe Dante had a different idea. I was a freshman in high school in 1981 and some friends and I played hooky from school and went to see The Howling. After about 10 minutes I was so scared, that I actually found myself wanting to go to math class. Dante's film is full of suggested terror, although once he shows you, he never lets up. Karen White (Dee Wallace) is a popular newscaster who has managed to catch the eye of a serial killer. She decides to help the police trap him, but unannounced to us is the fact that the killer has a secret... A very dark secret. After a terrifying encounter, Karen and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone), take a long needed vacation. A retreat colony up in woods is their destination and the townsfolk (including the late, great John Carradine) are just normal everyday people who welcome them with open arms. As the days go by, strange things begin to happen and we realize that the colony is actually a colony of... Anyway, the visuals are great and this was long before the computer generated crap that they throw at us these days. Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) is the resident bad dude or (wolf) as you may, and has one of the most classic transformation scenes I have ever witnessed. His sister Marsha Quist (Elisabeth Brooks) is definitely the hottest werewolf I've ever seen, and the cast is rounded out by Sheriff Newfield played by the one and only (Slim Pickens). The Howling certainly revolutionized the modern werewolf which has come a long way since Lon Channey Jr wore an afro wig and a pig nose, and there's not a lot of werewolf stranglings in this one. I have seen every werewolf movie ever made (literally), and The Howling has always remained my favorite, with An American Werewolf In (London)comming in at close second. If you have never seen this classic film, I urge you to go rent it, turn off the lights and pull the blanket up tight under your chin (for faster head covering action). You won't regret it, after all werewolves were meant to be big, ferocious, violent beasts that rip their victim apart. Nuff said.

Well of course. And since lately I'm getting more and more into werewolf films, I figured it was high time I actually bought this one and reviewed it. This, along with American Werewolf in London, were the two films that revolutionized werewolf movies and transformed them from just some guy running around bein' all hairy and strangling people. On top of it all, we have Joe Dante (Piranha, Gremlins) directing. Good times will be had by all!This film revolves around a news anchor-woman who is helping the police track down a serial killer, made all the easier by the fact that he's taken an interest in her. Well, everything goes just awful and she ends up traumatized. Her shrink suggests she and her husband take a comfortable, soothing vacation in a community that he's a major part of. Of course, the movie is helped along by the fact that the town just happens to be chock full of werewolves who can't seem to decide whether to eat these new people or have them join up.Here's the breakdownThe Good--We've got some beautiful and unique looking werewolves here. The first one we have a very clear view of, in the doctor's office, almost resembles some creature that's part wolf, part man, and part cat. It just kind of had that feel--not that it's bad, I liked it.--Interesting story, one of the better ones in the world of werewolves.--The acting is pretty good, one has to consider the fact that a lot of actors just don't take these kinds of roles seriously enough. So finding a movie like this where they do is quite nice.--Naked transforming werewolf sex scene by a campfire. Hmmm... maybe this should be the Memorable Scene....--Average amounts of violence--more a suspenseful werewolf film than a visually disturbing one. The gore, while only occasional, is really good.--Nice mystery story wrapped up in here.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help--Decent music, somewhat average for these kind of movies.--Dee Wallace-Stone's acting occasionally isn't quite up to par, shall we say...--One werewolf transformation sequence is actually animated--like with cell animation and it doesn't look very good. It's brief and small, and doesn't detract from the film's overall quality.--Dee Wallace's friends in the movie really seem to adopt the notion of werewolves rather easily--I would think it would be hard to accept that idea... oh well...The Bad--Some two-dimensional characters.--This film is in a series notorious for it's much crappier releases, but that's really about all there is that's not to like.The Ugly--Robert Picardo (the hologram doctor from Star Trek Voyager) plays the ultimate bad-ass werewolf--and boy, his face doesn't look good all charred with acid...Memorable Scene--Robert Picardo's werewolf in the Doctor's office.

Most of the big horror movies then (like now) were pretty lame. 'The Howling' is a notable exception. Watching it over twenty years after it was originally released is quite an eye-opener. It not only holds up well, it is in fact, a damn fine movie. Joe Dante must take the credit for this. For me in the 1980s Dante was like a smarter, more inventive Spielberg. Dante, who learned his chops working for Roger Corman as an editor, writer and director, is a knowledgeable horror buff (Universal, Hammer, Bava movies) with a sly wit and great sense of fun. 'The Howling' is full of in jokes and ironic nods, but never goes all the way into comedy. Dante takes the material seriously. This is a pretty scary movie and the werewolves are some of the best ever seen. Dee Wallace ('The Hills Have Eyes', 'The Frighteners') is a TV reporter who is traumatized after a close encounter with a serial killer (Dante regular Robert Picardo). Dr. Waggner (Patrick Macnee of 'The Avengers' fame), a charming psychiatrist she knows and trusts suggest that she and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) join him at his therapeutic retreat The Colony. I won't spoil the movie by going into detail about what happens next, but it's creepy and entertaining. Wallace is very good and Picardo, who usually plays comic roles, is convincing as Quist the psycho nut job. 'The Howling' was co-written by John Sayles, who pops up in a cameo, as does Roger Corman, and super fan Forrest J. Ackerman, former editor of 'Famous Monsters Of Filmland'. Dante is a loyal guy who always likes to acknowledge where he is coming from, so as well as Corman and Ackerman there are roles for horror legend John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'), Kenneth Tobey ('The Thing From Another World'), Slim Pickens ('Dr Strangelove') and Dick Miller (as Walter Paisley his character in Corman's 1950s b-grade classic 'A Bucket Of Blood'). 'The Howling' is sure to be enjoyed by every horror buff and for me is one of the all time best werewolf movies along with Universal's 'The Wolf Man' and Hammer's underrated 'The Curse Of The Werewolf'.

Where John Landis used comedy more blatantly, the humour in THE HOWLING is far more satirical and subversive. Undoubtedly, Rob Bottin's  effects steal the show as well as they did for John Carpenter's THE THING.

It is also one of the first (if not the first) to do an on screen transformation scene not using the old frame by frame technique. The story has a female reporter traumatized after she helps the police track down a serial killer. A friend psychiatrist sends her to a retreat known as the colony to help her unwind and get to the root of her problem. Well lets just say her first impulse was right as she really seems to think her and her husband are out of place in this retreat. I would agree, I do believe I would have left after seeing the first little beach party where the guy about to throw himself in the fire seemed the most sane. For the most part this movie has a bit of a slow setup, but once it gets going near the last 20 or thirty minutes it really gets going. The werewolves look rather good, there are a couple of scenes where they appear to be nothing more than cartoons or something, but for the most part they look like working models. There is a bit at the end which puzzles me as it seems to add humor into what was otherwise a movie that wasn't trying to garner laughs.

Most fans of the genre of Horror and of the sub-genre of WereWolf movies either love this movie...or hate it.Let me begin by saying that I admire this movie very much. I enjoy watching it, and the two subsequent sequels. In my opinion, after the third Howling, they got stupid, hokey, campy, and just plain bad. Also, let me warn you that this movie is dated, slow, and has large blocks of uneventful moments where even the most base character development is not being utilized.But, with that having been said, the story is a good story. It is poorly executed due to the large slow spots I mentioned before, but the story was a sound and well-written one. Everything does not just magically come together. The reporting team there as moral and emotional support for ace reporter, Karen White (Dee Wallace), is working very hard to put it together. Their discoveries do not come easy, but rather as a result of hard work, open-mindedness, and diligence. Not luck.The cinematography is mostly unremarkable, except for the scene in which Bill is attacked. The filmography is beautiful there, with the moonlight streaming out from behind two great trees, and the scene between is clear and lit by a beautifully brilliant silvery moonlight. Very good stuff.I also loved the use of The Wolf Man, 1941 with Lon Chaney, Jr. as a source for information in their research. This is an instance in which a movie used a real movie to quote, rather than some made-up movie. Wes Craven's use of this element was highly praised in the Scream Trilogy, and yet, here it is, twenty years earlier.This production also features a cameo by Forrest J. Ackerman, movie actor with credits in over 20 B-grade horror flicks, and a very good (if somewhat over the top) supporting performance by John Carradine.Naturally, most fans of the horror genre want to compare this movie to An American Werewolf in London. That is, of course, like comparing apples to submarines in that the former is a B production, with a small budget and the latter is a much larger funded project at exactly TEN times the budget. The Howling had a 17M return from a 1M investment, while AWiL had a 30.5M return from a 10M budget. Let's see...17X the investment/3.5X the investment. I'd have to say The Howling is the big winner, here, as far as profit goes. I use profit as a measuring stick, because it seems that profit is all Hollywood cares about anymore. Art and artistic expression no longer seems to be the point of film making these days. But for the sake of art, I loved both movies, this one and its competitor. The make up artistry used here was excellent, and actually worthy of the story. That, along with truly professional performances by Dee Wallace and Christopher Stone, make this an enjoyable and memorable film, which I have recently added to my DVD collection.All in all, I consider The Howling to be a benchmark film in the sub-genre of werewolf movies.It rates a hard-won 7.9/10 from...the Fiend .

It has marvellous special effects which are still quite good by today's standards, some good humour, well-choreographed chase scenes, and some good acting.  The script is weak and laden with cliches, but remember it is a parody in ways.  Dante names characters using the names of great horror directors(his idols I imagine) such as Terry Fisher, Freddie Francis, and Erle Kenton.  Forrest J.

With direction from Joe Dante and a script co-written by John Sayles, this flick was almost as awesome as the John Landis' England-based comedy-horror pic. Dee Wallace, who would later be better known as the mother in E.T., is fine as the television reporter who is recovering from an unpleasant encounter with a serial killer as she and her husband (Christopher Stone) take in a retreat in the woods with a community waiting there for them. Many effective werewolf transformation scenes abound although some may take so long that you want to laugh after a while. Still, good support from Robert Picardo, Dennis Dugan, Kevin McCarthy, Slim Pickens, Patrick Macnee, John Carradine, and in cameos, Roger Corman, Sayles, Forrest J. Ackerman, and frequent Dante regular Dick Miller as Walter Paisley, a name he first used in Corman's A Bucket of Blood. Great use of scares throughout up to the ironic finale.

The movie starts directly to the point. A brave t.v. reporter (Dee Wallace Stone) meets with a serial killer known as Eddie in order to get important information that could lead to solve the mystery of a killing spree in the city. When she meets him in a XXX store, he tries to attack her but police quickly shot him before. This traumatic events lead our heroine to seek the help of a psychologist who recommends her some rest in a special place he owns. Along with her husband, Wallace's character go to that place just to find fatal fates. As time passes, and many strange things occur, she suspects that something is just not right. The community is very weird. This community is a Werewolf community which has members such as serial killers, sexy vamps, and even old men among it's members. What is the mystery about the community? Who can help our heroine? Could it be that human society has something to do with it? The Howling is a perfect example of how something is much more better than what it looks.

This movie was shot in 1979, where most of the heroines survive at the end.Unfortunately we all know that isn't the case with this movie. To give some readers some insight into the book, the author basically wanted to comment on the dark nature of human beings and our gradual desensitized outlook on pornography and violence. Mankind (in the story and in our reality) is becoming steadily and increasingly more violent, and as result more sexual. He's trying to create a link between sex and violence, although it maybe be an old notion, he's right on the money. In addition the world that he creates is totally believable. I totally got this element of the story and therefore realized it was a metaphor for the beast, or monster that lies within us all. I think Joe Dante does an excellent job of bringing the darkness of the characters to life. Remember what sets this werewolf movie apart from the others of that time, is that the main werewolves are not ashamed of their demonic nature. In fact Eddie, TC and his sister Marsha all revel in the monstrous behavior. These aren't your father's werewolves a.k.a Lon Chaney. In the Curse of the Werewolf, the Werewolf is seen as a sympathetic character similar to that of a tragic romantic hero. There is nothing tragic about these werewolves. They love who they are and aren't trying to fit in. That aspect of the film scared the pants off me when I was 10. Most of us are used to seeing werewolves as self-hating and self-loathing but Dante flipped the script and decided to make them very self-absorbed and self-accepting. I guess that was his dark satirical spin on getting back to nature, psycho-babble. I hope some of the younger viewers will re-examine the under-lying themes of the movies and somehow get a better appreciation for the film.

The Howling is a rare exception. John Sayles thankfully threw away most of Gary Brandner's terrible source novel and wrote something much better. For once, characters who run up against werewolves don't have to go and find an old person to explain the plot to them because they actually live in a world where werewolf movies and tv shows and books etc exist.There are plenty of injokes, from casting John Carradine, Roger Corman, Forry Ackerman etc to naming most of the characters after directors or previous werewolf movies, but this is only part of the movie's appeal, instead of seemingly being the whole point as is too often the case in low-budget horror movies. The script is clever and witty, the characters behave intelligently most of the time, and it's well acted and well directed.Perhaps most importantly of all, Rob Bottin's creatures are the most impressive werewolves I've ever seen. Rick Baker's work on An American Werewolf in London was superb and equally groundbreaking, but when you finally saw the monster it didn't look like most people's idea of a cool-looking werewolf. Bottin's designs are fantastic, and the transformation scenes are as good as Baker's.Some people have commented that The Howling is a dumb movie that doesn't make sense. They've either accidentally seen one of the sequels, in which case, yeah they're all appalling, or else they weren't paying attention. Or they're on crack or something, I don't know. What I DO know is that all the good werewolf movies since can be counted on your left thumb. And there weren't a lot of good ones before it, either. I give it 10/10.

Even paying attention to making them digitigrade (toe-walking) and generic body shape that people never saw before (older werewolf movies always had the very human looking shape to them).The plot itself is quite rich for this type of movie, with some twists here and there. Unfortunately quite a few (too many) sequels of this movie were made that really aren't worth watching, but this (first) one is certainly one to watch.

When it comes to special effects, every artist has his or her own trademark, everyone knows that Rick Baker concocts a mean looking Gorilla, as that is his speciality, and he has carried that trend through many a movie.Likewise, the same can be said for the work of Rob Bottin, another genius in his chosen field. If you never saw his name attached to movies like 'Legend' but you witnessed the many wonderful creations on show within the movie, you identify instantly that work you see with that of the artist who placed it all together.This is a horror movie, that carries all before it. Great direction, groovy special effects, an eerie atmosphere that lingers throughout, a well written and literate script and best of all, a legendary list of character actors, who belong to that well cherished list of who's who in the horror world hall of fame.Without hesitation. 10/10 "},{"Title":"The best werewolf movie ever made","Date":"26 January 2004","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  Much better than American Werewolf in London in many ways.

At the time, I thought the film was bizarre and rather overrated. Of course, I was only seeing part of the film; the video was so dark and murky that I could not see what was going on most of the time. It was not until years later that I watched a  `cleaned up' cable presentation and realized what a good movie The Howling really is. Perhaps the better the image, the more enjoyable my experience, because seeing The Howling on DVD I was finally able to fully appreciate its greatness. Karen White (Dee Wallace) is a Los Angeles reporter suffering from nightmares, panic attacks, and frigidity as a result of a botched undercover mission to trap a serial killer called 'Eddie the Mangler'. Karen's psychologist, Dr. Waggner (Patrick MacNee), advises her to stay at `The Colony', a self-help village that he operates. She and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) travel to this secluded sector in Northern California for a week long `therapeutic vacation'. Before long, though, Karen starts to sense something is very wrong in The Colony. Her nightmares are becoming more vivid, and are now incorporating images of her husband and of people staying in The Colony. She hears howling in the night, and finds a mutilated cow in the woods. Meanwhile, back in L.A., Terry (Belinda Balaski) and Chris (John Dugan), a young couple who work at Karen's TV station, investigate the death of Eddie the Mangler for a news special the station has planned. Eddie's body disappears from the morgue, and they investigate further, only to discover that he was obsessed with werewolf mythology. When a panicky Karen calls Terry to tell her that Bill was bitten by a wolf in the woods, she rushes to The Colony to offer comfort and further her investigation. At this point, I will say no more. Of course you can probably figure out where it is headed, and if not by this point in the film you will know exactly what is going on. But The Howling is a film full of twists and turns and to spoil even one of them would be an injustice to first-time viewers. I have not seen enough werewolf movies to recognize every homage paid by this film, but apparently most of the characters are named after werewolf movie directors. Additionally, an expository scene from The Wolf Man plays as Terry learns that Bill has been bitten by a wolf, and a cartoon adaptation of The Three Little Pigs is cut into a scene of a woman being cornered by a werewolf. And there are a course an endless roster of genre cameos; Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), B-movie king Roger Corman, and Joe Dante regular Dick Miller, to name a few. Sound familiar? Sixteen years before Scream was even a reality, The Howling invented the `self-referential scary movie' sub-genre. In fact, the humor laced throughout the film is generally the most celebrated element of The Howling. It was certainly among the most influential; contemporary classics like Evil Dead, Fright Night, Return of the Living Dead, Re-Animator, and of course Scream owe a debt to the road paved by this film. The humor may be the most widely regarded facet of this film. However, in the end this is a horror movie, and a damn scary one. As much as I love the somewhat similar An American Werewolf in London, I give The Howling the edge largely because it never gets carried away with the comedic elements. Joe Dante, who at this point was best known for the cult classic Piranha, updated werewolf folklore by applying it to two of the more popular horror trends of the time female paranoia (Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives, Suspiria) and fear of non-urban environments (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes). Dante makes the most of these two thematic elements, while also cultivating a classic, spooky atmosphere rarely seen in post-Psycho horror movies. Dante also manages to tap into primal childhood fears of the dark, the woods, the fog, and The Big Bad Wolf. In fact, some of the film's most terrifying scenes make their mark because they so aptly recreate images from Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs. Looking back, it really is shocking how ahead-of-its-time this movie was. Not only did it turn the mirror on horror films of the past and present, but it also offered a shockingly accurate, post-Network glimpse into the media. From what I have read, the novel The Howling by Gary Brandner is vastly different, particularly in this regard. Instead of being an author (as she was in the book), Karen is a reporter, and this allows Dante to explore the notion that the American public was so desensitized by 1981 that television had to resort to extreme shock tactics to maintain viewership. Yet even more innovative is the similar viewpoint that people were also too sophisticated to believe anything even if it happened right in front of them. In a time of unprecedented cynicism and complacency (not to mention being the era of `reality shows'), Dante's message is more relevant than ever.When The Howling was released, it was extremely well received by critics and became a box office hit. Dee Wallace went on to play the mother in E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (prompting one of the funniest lines in Scream). Joe Dante went on to direct the blockbuster Gremlins. And special make-up effects man Rob Bottin went on to such films as The Thing, Total Recall, and Se7en. As the cast and crew were busy moving on with their own successes, The Howling did not get its inevitable sequel until 1985's loosely related (or so I have heard) The Howling II Your Sister Is a Werewolf. Over the next ten years The Howling would amass a total of six sequels, many of them barely released in theaters or sent straight to video. I have intentionally avoided these films, but from what I understand they give Amityville a run for its money as the worst horror franchise of them all. In fact, The Howling IV The Original Nightmare, is actually a remake of the first film! Normally a string of ill received follow-ups harms a film's reputation, but in this case, it may have actually strengthened it. More than two decades after its initial release, The Howling remains one of the most enduring horror films of the 80s.

To recover from this incident; she and her husband head to a remote psychiatric retreat run by Dr. George Waggner. But while there she becomes even more on edge, as Karen suspects that there are weird things going on at this camp with the woods coming to life with constant howling and one of the women there is getting real close to her husband. Meanwhile, back in LA her work buddies Chris and Terry continue their investigation into Eddie and come up with some unusual revelations. When they go to check out his corpses, the body is gone.I don't know, but never really got the hype that surrounded this flick. The first time I watched it was somewhat unsatisfied. The next time it was slightly better, but I just couldn't put my finger on why its held up so high, as again I was still left a little unimpressed. So, third time around&#133; my thoughts are still the same, but I probably got a bit more from it now than from my previous two viewings. That's not to say I think now it's a grand piece of entertainment, more so a mildly riveting exercise that has it's pluses and minuses.The film paired up director Joe Dante and screen writer John Sayles again, after their collaboration in the incredibly witty, 'Jaws' knock-off Piranha (1978). The Howling goes for a sinister outlook in its contemporary take on the werewolf genre and Sayles' thoughtful script steers mostly away from the clichés associated with Hollywood werewolf films. Here it sticks with the true mythology (being able to shape shift whenever) of the lycanthropy. The one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb is the overabundance of in-jokes, satirical humour and references to old flicks. The sharply, sardonic humour seemed to hold a great rapport with the seriously morbid approach Dante went for here. What did get on my nerves though, was the plodding mid-section, which just didn't draw me in like I hoped. Well, I actually found the sub-plot with Chris and Terry investigating Eddie to be far more interesting with some unexpected developments than the main focus on the leadenly, dramatised interactions between Karen and her husband Bill with the strange occurrences at the medical retreat.After the relentlessly, seedy atmospheric build up within the first ten minutes, the story slowly dragged for quite a bit. That's until it makes way for an anxiety packed final half hour with one or two memorably, jarring scenes. Although, I found the climax somewhat anti-climatic. When it wants to be suspenseful, it is. I just wish there was more of it. Since the undeniably grimy atmosphere is perfectly, high on mood and when it shifts to its forebodingly, foggy woodlands its hard to escape the nightmarish feel, especially at night with eerie howling. The scenery is simply top-notch. Now I just wish the characters followed the same suit. Honestly they were mostly a unlikable lot that I didn't I care for one bit. Actually, I enjoyed the support roles more than I did of the leads. Belinda Belaski and Dennis Dugan as Terry and Chris were sturdy in their performances and gave their characters a little bit of solidarity. Robert Picardo nails it down as the slithering, monstrous Eddie Quist. There's a neat cameo from Dick Millar too. But the rest just didn't do anything for me. Dee Wallace was rather unconvincing and predictably uneven in her performance I thought. The same for Christopher Stone as her husband Bill Neill. Patrick Macnee seems lost at sea as Dr. George Waggner.What made the film has got to be the cracking special effects by Rob Bottin! I really liked the towering werewolf designs. But it was the transformations that caught the eye with the repulsively, petrifying body morphing. The convincing detail that went into it is exceptional, but I thought at times it did take away from the overall effect by going on for just too long. The light in those scenes and sometimes other sequences was extremely poor I thought. Even the editing is kind of choppy and there's a odd inventive camera shot amongst the orthodox frame shots. Sometimes I thought the zooms got to close to the action, where we don't always get a good look of what's happening. But the score just felt out-of-place and basically corny. The film does have a sleazy tone and there's a grisly werewolf attack here and there.Even though I found The Howling to be rather unsavoury as a whole, but there's a definite backbone that holds the film together with its wry humour and gruesome make-up effects.

It escapes me why this film is seen as no more than a werewolf slasher pic even by respected critics, because in a sense, it did what Scream did fifteen years later self-deconstructing. It is not about the plot. It is about itself. It comments on all the conventions it happily plays upon itself. The violence, gore and werewolf metamorphoses are disarmed by the ironic way Dante utilizes and annotates them. He inserts countless in-jokes and references, often veiled and subtle, not just to movies and TV like with The Big Bad Wolf in The Three Little Pigs but also concerning characters eating Wolf Brand Chili, the momentary glimpse of a copy of Howl by Ginsberg, mention of DJ Wolfman Jack, characters with names like Terri Fisher, which could be a reference to the British director Terence Fisher, who did direct a film called Curse of the Werewolf. The focus of this extremely hip post-modern wolf man movie is mostly on the humor, satirizing pop culture and the self-help craze, gaining comic effect even from some of the special effects.But it goes much much deeper than merely being reference-happy. What is really clever about The Howling is its pervasive visual references to a variety of media forms and aspects of popular culture themselves. We see cameramen, bystander-like TV sets and movie posters galore, we go behind the scenes of a network TV station. There is stop-motion animation and puppetry as well as special effects by Rick Baker and Rob Bottin that were state-of-the-art at the time. A silhouette of one of the monsters is obviously a cartoon animation (not unlike in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein). John Sayles (who co-wrote the blatantly metatextual script) and Roger Corman have cameos. Dee Wallace-Stone plays a Hollywood TV news anchor who is being stalked by a serial killer. In cooperation with the police, she takes part in a sting to capture the killer by meeting him in a scuzzy porn theater, where he forces her to watch a film of a young woman being raped, before she sees him emerging from the shadows. The final scene is a brilliant diametric reversal of this scenario in terms of the role of what's really happening, what's happening on the screen, and in what way horrific reality is stopped by bullets.The brave anchor nonetheless submerges the memory of the tremendous sight which she cannot accept, so her therapist, Dr. George Waggner, named after the director of The Wolf Man with Lon Chaney and Claude Rains, sends her and her husband, Bill Neill, a thinly disguised reference to the director of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, to a secluded countryside resort for treatment. As expected, the colony is chock full of oddball characters, and eventually werewolf sex, frightening shapeshifting and silver bullets abound. But all this elemental and earthy stuff takes place outside of the reach of mass media, at least to some extent, so a TV news anchor returning from this experience is going to want the world to know! But how can she? In a society surrounded and inundated by all kinds of bright, flashing mass broadcasting all the time, how can she make them truly connect and believe her claims no matter what she shows them?As befits a real B-grade horror flick, the leads are all basically interchangeable. Most of the more solid moments are left to the character actors, played by B-movie vets like Slim Pickens, John Carradine, and Dick Miller, as well as Patrick Macnee, who plays Wallace-Stone's shrink. I tend to nix comparisons to Tarantino because his fans tend to write off a lot of interesting filmmakers as QT wannabes, but this movie was made long before Tarantino burst onto the scene The Howling is like the Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill of horror movies. It's a post-modern pastiche that arrives insisting it is the real thing to some degree, casting all the right people, playing its own creative variations on a classic old-hat plot device, engulfing us with reminiscences of other movies and media like it and at the same time giving it a real-world edge. The Howling so consciously plays upon fantasy and allusions to midnight movies of yesteryear and werewolf lore, and reintroduces common, prototypical features of style. And there is always something about that self-aware quality that frees us from taking it seriously and we have so much more fun with it.

What really makes this one stand-out is the fact that there's a decided and enjoyable devotion to suspense along the way as it really settles into a pretty chilling tale along the way. The mis-direction at the beginning with the stalker angle and how it all confronts itself in the adult-theater gives this a great start, especially with the way it subtly hints at the change through the shrouded fog of the booth hiding it perfectly and requiring the need for the trip to the woods which is where the film really gets going here. From the constant otherworldly wolf-howls constantly echoing throughout the woods, the discovery of the slaughtered animals with inhuman wounds and the growing realization of the impending turn that it creates a rather frantic and chilling set-up here for the truth to come out really well. Even the other efforts here to bring the werewolf angle out, the investigation into the attacker and his connection with the colony out in the woods leads to some great fun here and leads into another really strong aspect here with that coming out in full-force on the great attack on the colleague out in the woods. With the pieces coming together nicely and the chasing throughout the area leading to a great scene that finally lets the truth be known, it sets up the film's utterly iconic and centerpiece sequence in the confrontation in the office here turns into the greatest transformation ever done. This shows the whole transformation in agonizing detail, starting with a close-up of the yellow eyes and the starting of the fangs to appear. From there, the face begins to get hairier and hairier, the eyes yellower, and the fangs more pronounced changing to get more dog-like and the snout begins to form, getting longer and longer with the face blackening. Finally, we get the body to change into a more wolf-ish form, and the best on-screen werewolf transformation is complete into a very fierce and evil-looking monster. This film's werewolf is the design that I hold closest to the official design of a werewolf ever. The design gives it a totally evil presence and it looks ready to rip the throat out of anyone who is unlucky enough to see it. That is a lot more threatening than a person who becomes a werewolf and is struggling with the curse of being one. With the action at the finale at the barn here they confront the creatures once and for all making this a wholly exciting old-school throwback finish where they're seemingly surrounded by creatures on all sides, it gives this a lot to really enjoy here over the lone flaw here. The only complaint here is that the werewolves are seen too close to the end to really make an impact. The threat is always there, but not once is a werewolf seen up until the end. They needed to appear more in the film. Beyond that, there's some debate to be had over the greatness of the effects, but no one will ever deny that this is one of the genre's landmark films.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, sex scenes included porno-movie footage, and scenes set in a porn shop.

In a film like this, produced in 1981, it is important to remember that this was when costumes were the norm in creating a horror film. There wasn't any or little C.G.I. (computer-generated images). I think because of this, directors and producers and the rest of the crew had to pour more labor into the film. It was something of an art to create gripping costume effects (like the severed arm in one scene of The Howling). Today, some of you would probably laugh, but please consider the times. Back then, some of the werewolf transformations shown in this film were considered top notch (albeit American Werewolf in London had the crown for best werewolf transformation). As to the plot, you can see old familiars like Patrick MacNee and Dee Wallace (probably best known as the mom in E.T.). Elizabeth Brooks caught my eye (for obvious reasons, especially her nude scene in the film) and I was surprised to find that her career ended prematurely due to cancer at the age of 47. There isn't much depth to this movie. It starts out bizarrely enough with a news anchor trying to get close to a suspected killer. She goes to a porn video store and witnesses something that gives her amnesia of the incident. MacNee suggests she go to a retreat he has in the mountains to unwind. She meets a bunch of strange characters there with her husband Bill. Soon after, howling sounds are heard and the attacks begin. Pay close attention to the 80's special effects of the werewolf transformations.I had a few flashbacks of the B-type movies back then with the intense fog they put into parts of the film and the scary organ background music.

Great scares, a good cast, a witty, often humorous script and superb makeup by Rob Bottin make this the best in a generally weak horror sub-genre.Also distinguished as having the absolute worst group of sequels ever made to a successful movie. Each one is uniformly worse than the next. In fact, as good as the original is, the Howling sequels are the polar opposite - each one is a bigger, steamier pile of doggie (or wolfie) poo than the previous. Everyone involved in those cinematic abortions should be forced to sit through them until their uncreative little heads explode. Almost as good in the werewolf genre is Jon Landis' An American Werewolf in London from the same year. Also check out Dog Soldiers (2002). They openly ripped off The Howling but at least did a fine job of it!! Well worth a rental!

Featuring a cast of all-star '80s horror movie stars, THE HOWLING used great special effects for it's time and stirred up some genuine scares with those who have seen it. While most of the sequels were probably not even worthy of being filmed, this original thriller spooked up some major thrills for me.The movie starts out slow, opening into the life of a news reporter and how she is being stalked by some serial killer that has been terrorizing her neighborhood. After that, the movie takes a little while to start going. Just when I was ready to say the hell with THE HOWLING, it started to get good. The werewolf attack sequences are amazing, especially the transformation scenes. They were all remarkably good considering it's time period. The make up is good and I was quite surprised to see Dennis Dugan starring in a horror movie. (He is the guy who directed the hilarious comedies BIG DADDY and SAVING SILVERMAN). The end of the film is probably the best part. It is not the best ending that could have been thought up, but it was still a very good one. The whole werewolf myths and legends told throughout the film were very effective in building up the mood. There is even a scene were parts of the 1941 chiller THE WOLF MAN are shown. This movie is a must-see for all fans of serious horror films and anyone who loves a good scare. Don't watch it on a full moon... THE HOWLING gets 4/5.

But he made his mind up and on second thought he went for the werewolf thing thus getting quite an achievement in the sub-genre under a limited budget. Even if special-effects are slightly better in An American Werewolf in London, one cannot deny that the final product in The Howling is far better. An American Werewolf looks more like a big rabid dog, whereas the wolf-people from the Howling resemble the ancient characters from Middle Age depictions.The story is campy, yet the movie is amazing and innovative in many regards, like the F/X department with the inflatable masks to turn mouths into muzzles, before John Landis' film. Werewolves enjoy being mutants, unlike the typical tale of the man cursed to become a beast in full moon nights. It even went to the extent making these creatures transform at any time of day or night.Most of all, The Howling accomplishes its goal by creating a good suspense atmosphere in which a legend told so many times is given a surprisingly new treatment in Hollywood standards. The first movie to bring a twist to the old Lon Chaney's tale.Very worth watching, especially now that is has been released on DVD.

The special affects, although riveting, aren't as amazing as some say. The areas this movie is strong in is atmosphere, character development, and some great shocks.The first half of the movie takes a long time to set up the characters and situations. Dee Wallace plays Karen White, who is traumatized by a rapist. Her psychiatrist advises her to go to a vacation area in the woods. She brings her husband and two friends. What they don't realize is that the area is a coven for werewolves, and the normal looking vacationers are actual werewolves. Wallace, her husband, and friends are all terrorized by the lycanthropes.(Spoilers)The second half of the movie picks up considerably. The best scenes in the movie is where one of the female werewolves lures Wallace's husband in the woods to have sex with him and makes him a werewolf in the process. The special affects start working well here, but get slightly overdone by the end of the sex scene. Another scene is where Terri(Wallace's friend) stumbles in a deserted creepy cabin where she finds pictures of the killer who terrorized Wallace. A werewolf spots her snooping around and chases her. The ending is pretty good, if not a bit hokey.The acting and gritty, tense atmosphere work very well, and the chase scenes are excellent. The special affects are sometimes excellent, but sometimes very fake looking. There are some slow parts, but the end result is very good. Recommended definitely for all horror fans. "},{"Title":"A flawed, but entertaining and sometimes scary werewolf film.","Date":"24 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  ** 1/2 out of ****The Howling is considered by many to be a horror classic.  I'm not sure I would quite call it that.  Masterful horror films are rare; among the best are Jaws, The Exorcist, and John Carpenter's The Thing.  The Howling doesn't rank that highly, but it is nonetheless a mostly well-made horror film that provides good late-night chills.  Werewolf movies are mostly bad (check out this one's sequels), and this could very well be the best of its kind, though I will admit it's been awhile since I've seen An American Werewolf in London.Karen White (Dee-Wallace Stone), a popular news anchor, has been arranged to meet a man who calls himself Eddie, a serial killer who has a special interest in Karen herself.  With the police following along, they follow her into a porno shop, where they proceed to kill Eddie.  Karen is haunted by the events that occur, and she can no longer remember what exactly happened in her short meeting with Eddie.  She is recommended by Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Mcknee) to take part and stay awhile in this experimental colony he has up north in the woods.  She gladly obliges, and is accompanied by her caring husband, Bill (Christopher Stone).The first few days at The Colony are relatively relaxing for Karen.  Even though she's startled a bit by Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) and her feral brother, T.C.  But at night, she notices strange things, such as frightening and piercing howls that sound unlike anything she's ever heard.  She also finds dead cows in the forest.  Inviting her friends and co-workers, Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terri (Belinda Balaski) over, they investigate the place and begin to uncover its sinister secrets.Director Joe Dante seemed to be making two movies.  The Howling's first half is slow-moving, plodding, and not nearly as interesting a set-up as it should have been.  The serial killer subplot is treated as a second tier, and isn't tied in to the main story particularly well.  A couple of scenes are also more cheesy than frightening, such as the first sight of a werewolf, which looks more like a giant puppet than any lycanthrope.But Dante improves the film significantly in the second half, creating a lot of suspenseful scenes, as well as one truly terrifying moment when a werewolf suddenly appears in a scene in the most unexpected fashion.  From around the 50-minute or so mark right up to the final scene, The Howling is absolutely riveting.  The famous werewolf transformations are also a sight to behold.Working to the movie's advantage is the setting, since it's always fun to watch a horror flick set in the woods.  Sometimes, when it's done well, a la The Evil Dead, you can have a lot of fun watching it.  The Howling falls into that category and the setting helps enforce the atmosphere and tone.  The constant amount of fog and mist is a bit annoying, but it's easy to get over that once the fun sets in. Watching this film (particularly the second half) gives me an added appreciation and sense of nostalgia for the way horror films were styled in the 80's.  The Howling relies quite a bit on its great sense of atmosphere, setting, and mood.  This isn't a teeny-bopper film with a serial killer running around, slashing people everywhere.  The situation presented is scary, and Dante plays many of these moments out the right way. There are some other flaws, however.  Character development is given a good attempt, and it does work somewhat, but I never quite got behind Karen White as much as I felt I should have.  Dee-Wallace Stone delivers a decent performance, but is hampered by a script that doesn't fully flesh out her character.  Of course, good attempts like this are still better than your average horror film.  Christopher Stone as her husband is fairly lifeless, not so much bad as he is given not a whole lot of material to work with.  Dennis Dugan and Brenda Balaski are both good as Karen's friends, with Dugan exuding what seems to be genuinely likable personality.  These days, he's mostly well-known for directing a few Adam Sandler films.Robert Picardo as Eddie has very little screen time, but is appropriately chilling in the scenes he's in.  Elisabeth Brooks is especially creepy as a (possibly) nymphomaniac werewolf with an attraction towards Bill.  She also bears a startling resemblance to Angelina Jolie.I've read from many reviewers and critics that this film is supposed to be a partial comedy.  While there are a few laughs, they seem more like the usual comic relief you'd see rather than all-out horrific humor Evil Dead 2 or The Return of the Living Dead style.  This is more suspense and horror than comedy, for sure.  The biggest laugh probably comes near the end, which also manages to be a fairly poignant scene, surprisingly enough.  Dante really balanced out that one scene almost perfectly.Of course, what review of The Howling could go by without mentioning the visual effects, which are part of this film's fame.  Some parts are definitely cheesy by today's standards, but the werewolf transformations are very well-done.  Makeup artist Rob Bottin showed true talent in creating a believable and formidable monster.  Credit must also be given for the lack of extreme gore effects.  There are some violent and bloody scenes, but compared to many other horror films, this one is relatively restraint and is all the better for it.  The emphasis on suspense over blood is always welcome.    So, The Howling comes as a recommendation from me.  I enjoyed much of it, found a lot to like and appreciate, though to get to the film's meaty parts (pun intended), you still have to bear through a relatively dull beginning.  It's still definitely worth watching.

If this has indeed happened to you, then 1981's The Howling won't put you at ease! It all begins on the mean streets of Los Angles with local TV reporter Karen White on her way to meet a vicious serial killer named Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo) who's reached out to her. After a terrifying encounter with Eddie in a darkened room and a police shoot, you can probably see why Karen's a little strung out. So on the advice of renowned psychologist Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) she and her husband, Bill(Christopher Stone) head up to a secluded, counseling sanctuary known as the colony. All seems well at first; the people are friendly if not slightly odd to some degree but still friendly enough. But just when she's settling in for the night that's when the howling begins. Soon enough, we discover that the colony is actually a place for werewolves to get away from the civilized world and these aren't your Lon Chaney type wolves that have to wait for the moon to be full. They are the primal beasts within all of us, waiting to be unleashed onto the world. Will Karen and Bill make it out or are they destined to be victims of the howling?Directed by Joe Dante (Gremlins, Pirana) The Howling came out at a time when werewolf films were all but dead. There hadn't really been any real hits like 1941's The Wolf Man in decades and most studio heads considered the werewolf premise corny and outdated. Needless to say, The Howling forever destroyed that idea. Based off of the novel by Gary Brandner, the story strips away all talk of the full moon belief (Which was never part of the original werewolf lore to begin with. The whole notion of the full moon was created by Curt Siodmak when he wrote the screenplay to 1941's The Wolf Man) and instead presents the werewolves as simply shape shifters who have a craving for blood every now and then. This makes them more evil and powerful since there are no limitations to where and when they can transform. All of this is directed masterfully by Dante, who is able to create a spooky and foreboding atmosphere and for a second make you believe that all talk of beasts in the night may not sound so ridiculous after all. I would even go as far as to say this is his best work. The script is cleverly written to include not only horror but a few inside jokes for those who know a thing or two about werewolf flicks.And as for makeup, this isn't your grandfather's werewolf flick. For the longest time, Hollywood werewolves looked like a guy with a hairy football glued to his head (No offense to Lon Chaney and the guys at Universal). Here, the werewolves look exactly as they should; big, hairy, mean beasts from the pits of hell. Rob Bottin must be congratulated all the way for his work here, especially when it comes to Eddie's transformation sequence which has to rank as one of the best transformation sequences ever. All of the actors and actresses play their parts well, which goes a long way to making films of this type into something special. Dee Wallace proves she is by far one of the actresses when it comes to getting into character and being scared out of her mind when playing Karen. Christopher Stone should be congratulated for his role as Bill, who badly wants to help his wife but is unsure just how. Patrick Macnee of The Avengers fame is delightful to watch here as the good if not slightly unconventional doctor, as is Robert Picardo as the disturbing Eddie Quist. Rounding out the cast is the beautiful but sadly deceased Elizabeth Brooks as Marsha Quist, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Dennis Dugan, Noble Willingham, James Murtaugh, and many more who I just don't have space for. In the end, The Howling is a everything a horror film should be Spooky, scary, unsettling, and able to stand the test of time. This film, along with An American Werewolf in London of the same year, probably saved the werewolf genre from extinction and still is one of the all time greats of its kind. There were a bunch of sequels after this one, but none of the ones I saw could hold a candle to this one. It's a real testament to the quality of work Dante and co. did on this. So without further adieu, lock all the doors, shutter all windows, and settle in to watch a modern horror classic. P.S. Might not be a bad idea to keep some sliver at hand in case you should hear the howling outside your bedroom window!

It ain't natural.","Date":"29 July 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The werewolf genre had laid dormant for a while, to be successfully and memorably revived by this film and An American Werewolf in London in 1981. Using the Gary Brandner novel as its basis, it goes off in interesting, unexpected, and intelligent directions, adding fascinating layers to the story. Screenplay credit is given to John Sayles and Terence H. Winkless, with Joe Dante, one of many graduates of the Roger Corman school of filmmaking, in the director's chair. The story has a prominent TV newscaster, Karen White (Dee Wallace, in her first top-billed feature film role) traumatized by the attack of a serial killer (in a porno movie booth, no less) and sent to the woodsy encounter group retreat run by eminent psychiatrist Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee). What Karen doesn't know is that her attacker, Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo, in a hell of a film debut) and virtually everybody at the retreat is a werewolf. Of course, going by the first 40 minutes or so of this film, one may not know it's a werewolf film, which is one of its strengths, as it builds its mystery. Going against the grain of classic werewolf films, Sayles, Winkless, and Dante don't portray their werewolves as tragic victims but evil, primal beings that would rather be adhering to werewolf tradition and feasting on their human counterparts. In Sayles's own words, these are monsters that completely unleash their Id. In addition to its genuine scares and suspense, the film also has an incredible self aware humour about it - without resorting to cracking jokes - with many of the characters named after men who directed werewolf films. There are other wolf references as well - Wolf brand chili, a copy of Allen Ginsburg's Howl, etc. The film is much like American Werewolf in the way that it can have one laughing while functioning as a true horror film. The cast is just amazing; Wallace and Belinda Balaski are lovely and appealing as always (with Balaski figuring in what is one of the major set pieces of the film), and Dennis Dugan, Christopher Stone (Wallace's husband), Kevin McCarthy, John Carradine, Slim Pickens, Picardo, Noble Willingham, James Murtaugh, and Kenneth Tobey adding to the fun with their appearances. Co-star Elisabeth Brooks is extremely alluring as nasty temptress Marsha. Sayles himself and the legendary Dick Miller offer side splitting cameo performances, and Corman himself turns up as a man at a phone booth. The then very young Rob Bottin, recommended for this project by his mentor Rick Baker, supervises the stunning makeup and creature effects; both men can take credit for two very impressive man into werewolf transformations in their respective films. The werewolves here are bipedal, but more wolf than man and pretty terrifying. Wonderful music by Pino Donaggio, typically excellent prop work by art director Robert A. Burns, and ingenious closing credits (with a little bonus after said credits) all also combine to make this enjoyable and worth discovering or revisiting. Followed by seven (to date) inferior sequels. In conclusion, it's hard not to be amused by any film that includes the hilarious quip, Screw this 'channel your energies' crap! Eight out of 10.

That same year, Joe Dante, with The Howling, delivered what is in essence a gift to all horror fans. His werewolf picture features some truly frightening monsters, several of the most impressive transformation sequences anyone could desire, and a cast that is itself a tribute to the classic horror pictures of the past. In the film, we meet TV news anchor Karen White, appealingly played by Dee Wallace a year before E.T. would make her a household name. After a traumatizing run-in with a serial killer, Karen and her husband (played by Dee's then real-life husband Christopher Stone) go up the California coast to rest and recuperate at The Colony, an alternative-lifestyle, group-therapy retreat of sorts run by a pop psychiatrist (the ever suave Patrick Macnee). At this late date, I don't think I'm spoiling the party too much by stating that The Colony's residents are a pretty, uh, hairy bunch of folk! Dante directs his film skillfully, and although he reserves most of Rob Bottin and Rick Baker's remarkable FX for the final third, the viewer is constantly afflicted with a feeling of unease, leavened by much insider humor. That great cast of horror vets--including John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy, Kenneth Tobey and Dick Miller (hilarious as antique bookseller Walter Paisley...the same name he sported in Roger Corman's 1959 quickie A Bucket of Blood!), plus cult fave Slim Pickens and appearances by Corman himself and horror editor Forrest J. Ackerman--is truly a godsend, and some likable newcomers, such as the late Elisabeth Brooks, with her Angelina Jolie-like good looks, and Robert Picardo, who few will recognize as the holographic Doctor from Star Trek Voyager, make significant contributions. When I saw this film in the mid-'80s, I remember thinking how strange it was that Dennis Dugan, who I knew only as a weasly putz from an old M*A*S*H episode, should wind up being the hero here, but such indeed is the case. Watching the film recently, for the first time in well over 20 years, I was struck by how much I remembered of it, and indeed, some of the picture's set pieces are truly made to stick in the memory. Though followed by five in-name-only sequels at this point, all of which are supposedly pretty lame, the original Howling is surely the one to go for. A class act, plain and simple, and a howling success.

The Howling is that type of monster movie - one that can be watched for pure fun and tension, but there are a few interesting subtle things that might strike you and cause you to re-watch the film... and notice more of them! Naturally, giving them away would be spoiling your fun, so I'll leave that to you.On the surface this is also a pretty good movie. Featuring some great creature effects that still look better than most CGI. There is key scene of human-to-werewolf transformation that lasts around 2 minutes, maybe more, that is the pinnacle of the film's special effects. Slowly but surely we see muscles expanding, teeth growing, and of course, lots of hair! It is a great moment and a great example classic special effects.

Someone might think I give this sort of film too much credit and meanings, but it's affected me so much over the years that I must have at least some werewolf-blood in me...This is so much better film in every possible category than An American Werewolf In London, that it's absolutely beyond me how any horror-fan could think otherwise; while in the latter the dream sequences are also very good and the moments of carnage in the end memorable, even those pale in comparison. And what comes to humor, the acting, photography, mood, and ESPECIALLY the horror scenes... it's a clean sweep. AAWIL's worst problem still is the mishandling of werewolf-legends full-moon is needed but silver-bullets are not. So it's like shooting a rabid dog in the end...Howling has it's tongue-in-cheek-approach in many ways of course too, but comedy never gets in the way of real horror.

Among those legendary creatures, werewolves have always been very popular, evolving to the point of being nowadays an icon of horror fiction thanks to the movies made about them. George Waggner's The Wolf Man, starring Lon Chaney was probably the most influential of all, as almost single-handedly it created the basis for the modern werewolf's myths; however, in 1981 three movies appeared that revolutionized the werewolf in film, giving the creature a brand new set of fangs Michael Wadleigh's Wolfen, John Landis' An American Werewolf in London, and this movie Joe Dante's The Howling. The fresh and original spin that these three movies gave to the werewolf's myths has proved to be enormously influential, and it's safe to say that 1981 was the year of the wolf.Dee Wallace plays Karen White, a journalist who has become the new target of infamous serial killer named Eddie (Robert Picardo). Working with the police in the case, she gets traumatized after a near fatal encounter with the killer (which ends with the police killing Eddie), so she is ordered to take a vacation in order to recover from the shock. In Dr. Waggner's (Patrick Macnee) colony, she finds some tranquility and relaxation, however, she also finds that something is wrong with the other inhabitants of the resort. Unfortunately, she can't count with her husband Bill (Christopher Stone), as he as been seduced by one of them (Elisabeth Brooks), breaking their marriage; however, this will be the lesser of her problems as she unveils the secret behind the Colony's existence and the true nature of its inhabitants.While the movie is based on Gary Brandner's novel of the same name, it has to be said that most of the film's charm comes actually from writer John Sayles (Dante's regular collaborator), who took on Terence H. Winkless's early screenplay and gave it his very own touch, adding a subtle spice of black comedy and nice tributes to the history of werewolves in film. However, not everything was changed from the novel, as Brandner's erotic and brutal re-imagining of the werewolf is still overtly present in the story, giving the film its characteristic sleaze. The plot is very well developed, playing with the natural mystery and suspense of Bradner's story, although it's safe to say that it lacks good development of several supporting characters. Still, it can be said that while different, John Sayles's version of The Howling is a nice adaptation of the now classic horror novel.Right after directing three of Roger Corman's better known cult classics from the 70s, director Joe Dante arrived to the project with his very own idea of what he wanted for the movie. Dante shows in The Howling a big talent for creating haunting atmospheres, as well as a complete understanding of the satirical tone of Sayles' (another of Corman's former protegés) script. Cleverly using a wide variety of special effects (from Rob Bottin's awesome make-up to different kinds of animation), Dante makes a wonderfully film that certainly looks better than movies with bigger budgets. However, in a film not everything is about good special effects, and Dante knows it, so he keeps his monsters hidden during most of the film's runtime, in order to effectively showing them up in a couple of remarkable climatic scenes.While nothing surprising, the cast as a whole is very effective and truly better than the average for horror movies. As Karen White, Dee Wallace delivers a very good performance and carries the film with dignity. Christopher Stone is one of the bad seeds in the cast, as his performance is probably the weakest of the movie, and actually hurts the film. Dennis Dugan and Belinda Balaski play Karen's friends, and both are excellent in their roles, specially Balaski. Among the supporting cast we find excellent performances by Patrick Macnee, Elisabeth Brooks and Don McLeod. Legendary actors John Carradine and Slim Pickens appear in small but memorable roles that like most characters are named after horror legends. Overall, one could say that despite some exceptions, the cast is quite good and manage to shine despite some poor development of minor characters.Like the ones used in Landis' film, the special effects of The Howling are without a doubt some of the most celebrated works in this filed, and certainly one of the highlights of the movie. While a bit too dark (and oddly with that glossy, shiny look so typical of the 80s films), cinematography by John Hora is appropriate, as it gives the story a nightmarish surreal look, similar to the one given to 1941's classic The Wolf Man. Pino Donaggio's original score for the movie is good, although sometimes too eclectic, with some parts working perfectly while others feeling definitely out of place in the story. Sadly, even when The Howling is definitely an almost flawless film, it has earned a terrible reputation due to the awful quality of its sequels, which have gone downhill ever since The Howling II was released. Among horror fans there is always the question about which of the three werewolf movies of 1981 is the truly best, and while personally I feel inclined to say that An American Werewolf in London is the one, Joe Dante's The Howling is, in my opinion, a very underrated classic that despite the constant release of bad sequels, has kept its magic intact all those years.

John Sayles' script is both witty and scary, the special effects are sensational, the big ensemble cast are a terrific bunch of weirdos, and the photography and direction are both top-notch. For me, the acid test of this kind of movie is the monster, and make-up effects genius Rob Bottin creates fabulous, cartoon-inspired, hairy, snarling, bipedal, fanged horrors straight out of Little Red Riding Hood. They are terrifying, absurd and visually stunning; there is a moment where Balaski pulls a paper file from a drawer and a werewolf hand enters screen right and delicately plucks it from her which is one the most deliciously scary horror movie moments ever done. I also love the way this film is all over the place thematically; the first fifteen minutes come on like a sleazy urban nightmare, then it turns into an adult fairy-tale. It plays as a straight horror flick but it's also an absurd satire of TV news, self-help therapy and communal living. Wallace's intense, straight-as-an-arrow performance should be at odds with the sly jokes and outrageous situations, but it's not - it just all gels seamlessly. She's backed up by an amazing support cast - Balaski is just sensational as the intrepid Terry, Brooks is every teenage boy's fantasy come true and her last line is a corker. Macnee, McCarthy, Miller and Pickens are lovable old pros, Picardo is unforgettable as the depraved killer and the iconic Carradine is terrific in one of his last great roles (the first shot of him is fabulous). And don't miss Sayles' cameo as a dogmatic morgue attendant. Dante directs with an assured combination of technical prowess, classic horror suspense and shocking imagery, pulling the very best movie possible from all the tools at his disposal. The showpiece werewolf transformation scene is truly stunning, but the movie is full of action, suspense, evocative shots, amusing observations and hair-raising moments. John Hora's camera-work is dynamic and dreamlike, exactly the right mix of light and shade to squeeze the emotion out of each scene.

But has this one aged as well as it's more well-known cousin? Well, it's certainly still original. Karen White, a news lady, is lured into a trap by a psychopath which involves her going into a sex shop, being made to watch a violent porno and then witnessing the man changing into some kind of monster. She is left emotionally-scarred by all this, in a very Hitchcock-ian way, and so a respected psychologist suggests she spend some time as his secluded retreat called The Colony. As it turns out, the colony is the last place on Earth she wants to be, and both Karen and her husband becoming increasingly unnerved by it's occupants and the strange creatures that seem to stalk through the woods at night.Some have said that they actually prefer this film to An American Werewolf, because it's a pure horror film as opposed to a horror-comedy, and thus they rank it as the greatest werewolf movie of all time. There are a few moments of subtle comedy here, but not as obvious as those in John Landis' own film. Also, you could argue that in some ways this is a more intelligent movie, which is really about the beast in all of us, as Dr. George Waggner states at the beginning. It's a psychological thriller, and a well-structured one at that.The Howling is one of Dante's best movies. It's certainly the one that got him noticed as a director, and just a few years after this he made Gremlins and became an even bigger cult horror icon. This is actually an early movie for him, which is impressive as it shows many signs of an experience and confident film-maker at the helm. The sets are fantastic, as is the lighting and the general atmosphere and pacing of the movie. The script is fairly tight and no longer than it needs to be, and the many references to werewolf movie history are subtly slided in to satisfy the film buffs. For example, there's a character named 'Jack Molina' -- a reference the average movie-goer won't get, but any werewolf movie fan is likely to. Various other characters are named similarly, but I'll let you get those yourself.The acting is for the most part pretty decent. All of the leads handle their roles well, and watch out for John Carradine in a small but memorable performance. I was especially impressed with some of the special effects on show here. The transformation sequence is at least in some ways on the same level as American Werewolf, and this was released several months earlier. It may have something to do with the fact that Rick Baker briefly worked on this project before moving over to the other, and so some of the same ideas may have been used.For genre fans, this movie is pure gold. Others may find it a little cheesy or a little dull in places, but what the hell do they know?

Eddie, back from the dead as a werewolf, kills Terry.

Of the old horror films; Dracula and Frankenstein have somehow come off better then The Wolf Man franchise and the concept of werewolfs didn't surface again until 1981. The old Hammer films successfully revived both Dracula and Frankenstein and a lot of horror films have dealt with vampirism and badly conceived monsters in the sixties and seventies.However, 1981 was a good year for werewolfs. An American Werewolf in London probably has more following than The Howling, but I've always preferred this fright fest to the John Landis classic. One thing, though, that Joe Dante and John Landis have in common here; the both infuse their horror tales with big doses of humor. Here, Dante cleverly mixes old footage of Lon Chaney's Wolf Man and old cartoons (a frequent Dante thing) as a bleak forecast for what's about to happen.Another thing he does well here is mixing in a bit of social satire spoof (maybe he watched George Romero's Dead films) when he created a self help group in a recluse colony (which of course is where the werewolfs can enjoy their nature freely).But overall, The Howling is a pretty effective horror film. The werewolf transformations still look impressive and the final look of the creatures is still wonderfully creepy. The humor works well here and this is overall a fairly well written movie. It's got a knockout opening act and it maintains it's atmosphere fairly well throughout. The Colony is a beautiful setting for werewolf mayhem and some set pieces are terrific.Dante's direction is first rate and it's a shame he veered more into comical horrors (but I still love his Gremlins films). Performances are fine; Stone is always the same but Robert Picardo, Dick Miller and Kevin McCarthy are entertaining in their small roles.Good werewolf films are few and far between; but The Howling is a keeper and comes highly recommended for horror buffs.

I laughed out loud when it takes Eddie, the rapist/murderer werewolf with horrible hair, 15 minutes to become a werewolf and as soon as he's done, Dee Wallace immediately throws acid on him. Was there no opportunity to throw it before or during the change? I also wish to thank the filmmakers for subjecting us to werewolf sex in the woods. That was just peachy. It was neat to have John Carradine and Kevin McCarthy in the same movie but did it have to be this one?

Perhaps you have to be hooked on the whole werewolf sub-genre in order to get a blast out of a film like this? There are certainly some compensations to be found, including enjoyable performances, clever in-jokes and spectacular werewolf transformation sequences, but The Howling just doesn't deliver the requisite scares and is too cliché-ridden for my liking.TV newscaster Karen White (Dee Wallace) helps the police to lure in a serial killer, Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). However, the scheme goes awry and Karen escapes a nasty demise by the skin of her teeth. Plagued by nightmares of her recent ordeal, she is advised by her psychiatrist Dr Waggner (Patrick Macnee) to go with her husband to a quiet retreat called The Colony for recuperation. The retreat seems quiet and relaxing enough, and is certainly a long way from the hustle and bustle of regular day-to-day life, but Karen still feels uneasy. Karen's husband tries to convince her that it's just a result of her fragile mental state, but gradually she begins to fit together the truth behind the retreat. It seems that all the residents are werewolves - among them the terrifying Eddie Quist himself - and Karen's only choice is to join them or be devoured!Director Joe Dante had already earned a small cult following after his comedy-horror Piranha a couple of years before, and with The Howling he gained more fans for his semi-camp take on the werewolf genre. However, for me it simply isn't in the same league as some of the other legendary horror films (The Exorcist, Don't Look Now and The Omen, for instance, are all a huge deal better) - heck, The Howling isn't EVEN among the best werewolf films ever made (The Wolf Man and An American Werewolf In London are two for starters that are far superior). In The Howling, the plot seems too predictable and Dee Wallace, in the key role, is inadequate. Real scares are missing - replaced by an unhealthy reliance on special effects. Admittedly I thought the special effects were good, especially for the era, but they alone can't make up for the telegraphed plot developments and the lack of a genuinely tense and unsettling atmosphere. The humorous use of character names that sound like old horror actors and directors (e.g Fred Francis, Jack Molina, Terry Fisher, etc.) is a nice touch, and Pino Donaggio provides an effective score, but on the whole The Howling only rates as an average entry. It has its army of fans but for the life of me I can't figure out why.

And while I tried not to let these factors build up my hope beforehand, I couldn't help but be let down by The Howling--here's a movie without a single memorable character, a plodding storyline whose twists can be seen a mile away, and a tongue-in-cheek attitude that seldom yields laughs. Bland blonde Dee Wallace (Cujo; The Frighteners) plays a reporter menaced by a stalker; after two cops shoot the stalker down in a porno booth, Wallace is menaced by memories of the incident and sent to an isolated seaside rehab clinic where--you guessed it--the stalker is the head of a colony of lycanthropes. While the concept bubbles over with possibilities, The Howling feels lazy and indifferent, only coming to life during the drawn-out transformation scenes (excellent FX work by Rob Bottin). Veteran B-listers Dick Miller, John Carradine, and Slim Pickens fare well in small roles, and careful viewers will catch cameos by director Roger Corman and Mick Garris.

It often gets forgotten that The Howling changed the werewolf DNA for the better, it invented its own hairy beast as it were, refusing to copy past treasures from the olde classic era. But director Joe Dante shows the utmost respect to those who had previously eaten at the Lycan table, naming many of the characters in his film after directors of Werewolf movies. Nice.Another thing forgotten, due in no part to the release of An American Werewolf in London later in the year, is that Dante's movie often has tongue in bloody cheek. It is happy to be a parody of the sub-genre of horror it loves, while some of the comedy visuals are deliciously and knowingly dry. But this is a horror film after all, and it so delivers in spades the frights and nervous tremors, even sexing things up as well. These Werewolves are completely bestial, and in human form enjoy having their secret other halves. This is just a colony at the moment but domination of all humans is most definitely appealing and on the agenda.Horror fans will sometimes stumble across a debate about effects wizards Rob Bottin and Rick Baker, who is best? It really doesn't matter, both are geniuses of their craft. Bottin is in the chair here, while Baker served as a consultant before doing his thing on An American Werewolf in London. The transformation sequences are superb and still hold up today as brilliant craft work, no CGI cheap tactics here. No sir.

She cannot erase the memory of the ominous large character that cornered her in a porno booth before police gunned him down. To recover, she and her husband, played by Christopher Stone are ushered off to a retreat called the Colony. These people are a bit off, and it doesn't help that the howls of wolves carry through the night. After directing Piranha, Joe Dante throws in his custom sense of humour to the werewolf theme. Special effects are exquisite with menacing werewolves looming. Wallace is a vulnerable lead who senses that something is wrong and reveals it in a rousing climax where terror is met with disbelief. Stone tags along until a hunting trip leads to him getting attacked and eventually a werewolf transformation that is starts out with rough sex in the woods. Patrick Macnee plays the seemingly trusting doctor who sends them to this colony where he often works. Dennis Dugan and Belinda Balaski play co-workers to Stone who search for answers.

I did see an American werewolf in London though. The special effects/werewolves in this are amazing. But the characters are too far away from what they were in the novel. In the book, everyone in Drago pretty well keep to themselves. In this they're all patients of Karen's psychiatrist. It isn't like that in the book. Also in the book the rapist of Karen isn't a werewolf and is arrested at the beginning. In this he is and worse yet they took the character Marsha from the book who seemed like she was related to gypsies/magic users and made her the rapist's brother. I hate that. They also changed Karen from a regular woman working in a hotel to her being a news reporter. The worse offense is getting rid of the character Inez Polk who Karen meets after she arrives in Drago that lives in the next town over. Instead she's replaced by 2 different characters who in the film Karen has known Karen for years. I will say Marsha was played by an unbelievably attractive actress but she pales in comparison to book Marsha who seemed a bit more intimidating. The thing that brings the rating down is Karen becoming a werewolf at the end. I will say this movie is entertaining but to me it pails in comparison to the book's character development and plot.

Could Karen be cracking up or is there something sinister going on in the secluded resort?Like most movies from the 1970s and the 1980s, The Howling is a slow- burner. This isn't one of those horror films that starts with a bang, keeps a frantic pace, and goes out with a bang. It slowly establishes its plot and characters and gives the audience a little at a time until the climactic and shocking end. Things might move too slowly for today's impatient audience. I even found it tedious at times. The scenes get choppy throughout and it seems like director Joe Dante was rushing things at some points.Rob Bottin's special effects for The Howling are still just as effective today as they were in 1981. The werewolf transformation scenes are unnerving and quite detailed. One transformation takes what seems like three to four minutes. It's all about attention to detail when it comes to Bottin's practical effects and animatronics versus today's obsession with rapid fire CGI scenes of metamorphosis.The Howling does feature quite a bit of the usual unnecessary nudity found in 1980's horror films. However, this time around director Dante attempts to justify it by analyzing our need to let the beast within out, mostly through sexual and physical acts of violence. The doctor, played by the late Patrick Macnee, convincingly regurgitates a lot of primal scream mumbo jumbo throughout the movie.Although it's a bit slow and takes some time getting started, great special effects and interesting, albeit hokey, social commentary set The Howling apart from the normal monster movie fare.

Dee Wallace is great as the tragic heroine and the supporting cast include such goof ball character actors like John Carradine, Slim Pickens and Robert Pickardo. Not to mention the crazy sexy Elisabeth Brooks who does some kinky werewolf sex and so on. The Howling unlike the modern horror movies that feature werewolves and other supernatural creatures, feature great practical effects that are only rivaled by American Werewolf. However, I wouldn't call this film scary. It's hard to scare me or creep me out with something supernatural and especially if you have Slim Pickens in your movie. But horror movie doesn't need to be that scary to be good unlike comedies that need to be funny to any good.Werewolf movies doesn't get much better than Howling and American Werewolf in London.

Two other specific sub-genre pieces were released in 1981 (An American Werewolf in London and Wolfen), and could be seen as simply a product of film economics and bankable trends. Whilst financial reasons are fundamental to film production, innovations in other fields also contribute to this sudden vogue for lycanthropic themes. Prosthetic special effects had been transformed, particularly in horror cinema, by such films as Jaws (1975) and Alien (1979) (or even the inventive puppetry work of Jim Henson's creature workshop), which opened the door for a new generation who would elevate the craft of monster effects, bringing a more realistic, and fantastical vision to the screen. Even into the 1970's, the werewolf transformation was still created in the same way than 1941's iconic The Wolf Man, with a series of dissolves, adding fur and fangs progressively through the shots. The modern werewolf movie was to begin that horror trend to show everything. Filmmakers now had the ability (with the incredible skills of the likes of Rick Baker, Rob Bottin and Stan Winston) to show the transformation from man to monster, in visceral detail.Rick Baker was originally drafted to provide the special effects for The Howling, (he had to leave due to a commitment he made with John Landis for An American Werewolf in London), and was replaced with Rob Bottin, who did an incredible job. Aside from the effective transformations in the film, director Joe Dante's and screenwriter John Sayles (who previously collaborated on Piranha (1978), infuse the story with their combined knowledge of horror cinema, along with some humour. Dante represents that first generation of film geeks. His knowledge of cinema is encyclopaedic and his knowledge through referencing is displayed explicitly on the screen. Many of the characters are named after directors who had historically filmed werewolf movies (Freddie Francis, George Wagner, Terrance Fisher). The characters are also aware - within the film - of the conventions of werewolf mythology, which has been learnt from being within an increasingly film literate culture, perhaps an early use of post-modernist pop-cultural reflexivity. Coming out of a trend for more gritty, realistic horror (a cycle begun with Hitchcock's Psycho (1960)), and during the horror saturation of the slasher sub-genre, The Howling begins in the underbelly of society, Dee Wallace plays a television news reporter (Karen White) who has been conversing with a serial killer. She meets with him in the seedy back room of a porn shop. The opening feels more like a dirty slasher like Maniac (1980), with it's pseudo-Scorsese mean streets, that a monster movie, an opening that was utilised when advertised - the posters and trailers rarely alluded to the beastly aspect of the story. After the trauma Wallace endures from her meeting with Eddie (Robert Picardo - the serial killer), she is advised by her doctor Wagner (Patrick Macnee), to spend some time at a rehabilitation resort that he runs. Writer Sayles re-wrote the original script that had been adapted from a novel by Gary Brandner, and change it significantly, and brought in the same satirical charm that was in the Piranha (1978) script. Sayles came up with the idea of the resort, the kind of self help group that was prevalent in the 1970's.After the failure of the hippie revolution at the end of the 1960's, and the people's disillusionment of our institutions and governments resulting from incidents such as the Kennedy assassinations and Watergate, many of the lost generation (generation x) were looking for something spiritual, something other than reality. Many groups of New Age spiritualist and pop-psychologists were formed, in sometimes sinister forms. This kind of congregation would quite often be corrupt, and fuelled with sexual oppression. And what the victimised Karen finds at the spiritually enhancing resort is an archaic hive for the neurotic species of wolf. In this coven, the wolves are outsiders, on the fringes of society, and is a diminishing group who's relevance in the modern world is narrowing - they are struggling to function in this age. No doubt a comment also on the relevance of this Universal Monsters icon, having lost its ability to scare some time in the 1940's.A combination for great writing, incredibly effective special effects, and a director with gleeful affection for the genre, The Howling is a very well constructed horror film. It moves from the grindhouse realism of it's opening to the revelations of the creatures with consideration, creating a natural narrative structure. It is the equivalent of Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), which suddenly changed the genre from crime to vampiric horror. Despite the incredibly low budget, produced and distributed by AIP (America International Pictures), the stylish cinematography and editing, the film still holds up today, and is far superior than many of the werewolf films being made today (The Wolfman (2010) or Red Riding Hood (2011) for example). It's just a shame about all the sequels - six in total, which inevitably lose much of the sharp, satirical script and a collection of great character actors (including Kevin McCarthy, Slim Pickens, John Carradine). And what the hell; it's a lot of fun to watch.

With the Horror boom of the 1980s it was just a matter of time before someone took a shot at it.

The Doctor (Robert The Doctor Picardo on Star Trek Voyager) is the sex-crazed werewolf, Eddie, that sets the whole movie into motion?OK, that reveals that I am a die-hard Voyager fan, but it also states how this movie keeps impressing me after all these years.A lot of avid werewolf fans love An American Werewolf in London when I barely liked that feature. Picture it I was a kid, I had little patience. Okay, I still have very little of that quality but I needed to see the werewolf and soon or I would be busting at the seams. And American simply takes too long &#x96; especially when the man becomes a&#x85;DOG.So, I always loved and was always faithful to (the original and you better stay, STAY far away from the sequels) The Howling because it gets me what I wanted the most the anti-dog (stand-up) werewolf and quicker.Unfortunately, I realized something with this viewing This movie ALSO takes a bit to get to the goods. There's an enormous set up that I had (as an adult now) little patience for, as well. The problem is the version I watched over&#x85;and over&#x85;as a kid, was the edited TV version.When I watched this now, it was the DVD, with nothing edited out and it took more than half the relatively short horror flick to produce the werewolf. Now, that said, when it did appear, it was Fantastic. So much for the CGI of today that literally mocks what a real (meaning, what I consider to be a MAN-WOLF, a standing man who turned into a wolf) werewolf looks like.What we have here is News Anchor, Karen (Wallace &#x96; later known as Wallace-Stone) is investigating brutal attacks and agrees to meet Eddie who readily attacks her while changing into a werewolf. She doesn't fully realize this as a rookie cop shoots and supposedly kills him.Shaken and stirred Karen agrees to a mountainside retreat under the guidance of Dr. George Waggner (Macnee) with her husband. Unfortunately, she's unwilling to partake in sex, and Marsha (Brooks) is. And unfortunately for Karen, her husband is willing to partake in sex&#x85;with Marsha&#x85;and a quick bite, transforming him into a werewolf.Scared, Karen calls her news station friend, Terry (Balaski) up who, along with her own husband, has been researching the beast within. Once it's realized this group of spiritual healers at the retreat aren't up to actual healing, it's time for heroism, escape and the story of the century.The reason I realized this is not my favorite werewolf movie is because, frankly, Jack Nicholson's Wolf, is actually an overall better made film. While The Howling gave me everything I absolutely love about the myth of the wolf-man, i.e. a man that resembles a wolf, albeit a 6-foot-tall one, Wolf had better acting, story, dialogue, etc.That said, I will always cherish this film. It had comedy and a lot of tongue-in-cheek references (please tell me you noticed the dozens to other films.) And when the movie finally got going, half-way through, it was fierce. In fact, the mid-section of horror/attacks is some of my favorite werewolf attack-scenes in any movie to date, let alone any When Animal Attacks film.

There was only one werewolf movie I'd never seen The Howling.I could have watched it, mind you. But I put it off. Because although I am fascinated with the werewolf legend, it just so happens that the animal I fear the most ... is wolves. I thought The Howling looked extremely scary, so I put off watching - until this Halloween, when I received it for a gift. So, at last, I sat down and watched the last major werewolf film I needed to see.The film stars Dee Wallace as a popular Los Angeles newswoman who is involved in a near-fatal incident with a serial killer (Robert Picardo). A respected psychiatrist (Robert Macnee) sends her to a rehabilitation center called The Colony, located in the Californian forest. Wallace believes there's something weird about the place as soon as she arrives - but once she begins to hear the howling, she believes there may be something deadly lurking in the forest ...The only Joe Dante films I'd seen before watching this were Gremlins and Gremlins 2 The New Batch, both of which I enjoyed very much. Dante directs this film with an obvious love of the genre and of the classic horror films. It really enhances the movie. The cast is good, but the only two performances which really stuck out to me were that of Patrick Macnee and particularly John Carradine. I thought it would've been nice to see Carradine's part expanded. I also thought it was good to see Dick Miller, though I couldn't place what else I'd seen him in at first.I thought that half of the time, Pino Donaggio's soundtrack was good, and the other half of the time I thought they made the film seem hokey. I loved the film's ending tune, though.The highlight of the film is indisputably the spectacular special effects by Rob Bottin. The scene where Robert Picardo transforms into a werewolf has been rivaled only by the transformation in An American Werewolf in London, and The Howling's transformation may be even better. The effects really made the film for me.The film's script was nothing really original, and the movie was at times quite clichéd. But that's part of the fun of it. All in all, The Howling was not as scary as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it very much and would gladly watch it again, if only for the special effects.

Travel back to the days of scream queens and animatronics and you have what I believe to be one of the best werewolf movies ever (or at least of the 1980s titles).Dee Wallace plays Karen Stone, a TV news anchor who was reporting on a mysterious serial killer named Eddie Quist (played by Dante film regular, Robert Picardo). She becomes traumatized by something she witnesses during a freaky visit with the elusive Quist. Unable to shake the nightmares, she takes a break from work and heads upstate to a retreat in the mountains with her husband Bill (played by Dee Wallace's then husband, the late Christopher Stone). But, the retreat is no peaceful setting and most of the residents are quite eerie. Especially cabin neighbor Marsha (Elizabeth Brooks) and her creepy cannibal brother, T.C. (Don McLeod). Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Karen's coworkers, Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) are on their own scavenger hunt, investigating deeper into the bizarre and creepy persona of Eddie Quist, leading to a discovery of why The Colony residents are so suspicious. In the age of animatronics and latex handywork, Rick Baker and his special effects team (yes, other people can do movie magic besides the famous Stan Winston studio) provide the awesome visual wizardry that make this (and many horror movies of the 1980s) so fantastic. We see a lot of human-to-werewolf transformations (and some obviously animated human-to-werewolf transformation sequences), which is always a good quality for modern horror movies. With Joe Dante directing, expect to see a lot of Dante cast regulars, including Robert Picardo as Eddie Quist and big screen horror favorite, Dick Miller (who is nearly always cast by Dante and is paired up with Picardo again in the Dante horror comedy, The 'burbs, as the garbagemen). The cast has some pretty notable people for it's day (besides Dee Wallace who is well known in the genre). While American Werewolf in London, released the same year, is most known for it's terrific special effects sequences, it is not the best werewolf movie of the 80s simply because the story isn't all that entertaining (and often becomes too long) because it's too simple (two hikers get lost in England, one killed by a werewolf, and the dead friend floats around in purgatory trying to warn his friend that he, too, is now a werewolf since he was bitten by the same creature). That's what distinguishes the Howling, one of the major werewolf productions of the 80s, from American Werewolf in London. The fact that The Howling offers a more entertaining story and characters (and the wacky soundtrack) that will really leave you with a disturbing feeling (what is it about these weirdos at The Colony and what does it all have to do with Eddie Quist). This is quite a different werewolf tale as well, though it has elements of the old 50s horror movies (like old, wise locals warning people newcomers to beware of something evil about the town). But, for the most part, it is an original, entertaining story, with super special effects.

Dee Wallace plays a newscaster who is attacked by a perverted serial killer in a porno parlor one night.  However, she can't remember everything that happened; only frightening fragments of memory remain, popping up at inopportune moments and interfering with her life.  A kindly doctor recommends a retreat, and sends her to a peaceful colony in the country where she can relax and get her life back together.  Too bad the colony is filled with werewolves.The special effects look a little dated now, but they're still impressive, and icky. Elisabeth Brooks is great in her role as a nymphomaniac werewolf who seduces Wallace's total jerk of a husband and bringing us one of the first transformation-during-sex scenes.  It's an interesting film about conformity and rebellion and our violent culture which could reasonably produce (and just as easily conceal) a predator.  But it's also a pretty good werewolf movie, plain and simple.  There's mysterious howling sounds deep in the misty woods under a full moon, there's scary chases and big, ugly monsters terrorizing girls.  In short, it has everything a werewolf movie requires.

Possibly Joe Dante's most entertaining film (although many would probably argue that Matinee is the superior achievement), The Howling plays fair to both film lovers (who will appreciate John Sayles' movie reference laden screenplay,  Dante's stylish direction and John Hora's colorful, Bava-esque cinematography) and horror fans (who, while ignoring the film's overall quality and parodistic elements, will get off on the still excellent make-up effects and gore scenes).  A great cast humanizes Sayle's jokey script, with Dee Wallace and Dennis Dugan actually managing to add some emotional power to what should have been an utterly tasteless finale.  And its amazing what technical wonders Dante and his talented crew were able to accomplish on such limited resources (the film was made for well under $2 million, approximately 1/5 of the budget for John Landis' inferior, disappointingly conventional An American Werewolf in London, released at approximately the same time). The Howling is so much more than merely the best werewolf movie since the 1940s; it's a witty, inventive, deeply satisfying entertainment, The Bride of Frankenstein of the 1980s.  (NOTE  The poorly made, in name only sequels to The Howling are aimed squarely at pure gore/horror fans, who have always loudly professed confusion regarding the satire and humor of Dante's original; for them, Howlings 2 - 7 are clearly better than the first installment of the series.)

Problem was I'd never been able to get more than 30 mins into it without something annoying me so badly I had to rage quit. Well, I finally got through it. Right to the end and yeah, it isn't for me. Not sure what the budget was on this thing, but man oh man does it look bad. Its shot with soft lighting, and not enough lighting, and most of the time looks like Vaseline was on the lens. I think its a technique to mask the low budget special effects. Also, the famous transformation scene which I finally got to goes on for like two minutes too long and isn't that interesting. I prefer the Rat in From Dusk Till Dawn, at least he doesn't mess around. Having recently watched E.T. again I think I've identified my major problem with The Howling. Poor Dee Wallace, who also plays E.T.'s mother, is on screen most of the time, and she's just not a good actress. She's more convincing here than in E.T. but really she just doesn't sell any of it. And that really pulls a picture down when your protagonist, your anchor, just doesn't convince or draw you in. So, yeah. While probably landmark in 1983, The Howling is one I've always struggled to get through, tried to force myself to like, but at the end of the day its a movie its not homework, you don't have to like it. If I had to pinpoint the other main thing that frustrated me about The Howling it would be that the actual werewolves don't do get to do much. They spend so long transforming its like that's all they're good for. Its pretty funny when you think about it. Again, a question of what was possible with the special effects, but earlier films did more. Nosferatu (1922) and Dracula (1931) are incredible to this day. The Howling (1983) is not. Its funny, maybe the genre just isn't for me. I can't think of a single werewolf movie I've liked except the remake to American Werewolf, and that one probably just hit me because I saw it at the right age, in the cinema.

For an 1981 movie with werewolves, indeed it is good, but it has that feel of a money grabbing movie studio doing an adaptation after a money grabbing publisher selling books of a certain type.

For my money, I have always found The Howling to be the more inventive, ambitious and satisfying of the two films.As the film opens, L.A. has been victimized by a series of brutal murders and the perpetrator has offered to meet with frightened TV news reporter Dee Wallace. The police sting goes slightly awry with the killer ostensibly dead and Wallace shell-shocked from the ordeal. TV psychologist Patrick Macnee recommends that she recharge her batteries at his quaint woodsy retreat dubbed The Colony. While Wallace and husband Christopher Stone deal with their new surroundings and the eccentric personalities at The Colony, friends/work colleagues Dennis Dugan and Belinda Balaski continue the investigation into the killer and find it suspiciously leading straight to The Colony.The Howling seems forever doomed to be unappreciated when compared to the later An American Werewolf in London. Although it opened first and broke ground with its werewolf transformation sequences, AWIL came later and got all of the glory and Oscar love. The effects here are nothing short of amazing and the fact that decades later they seem infinitely more impressive than the crummy CGI transformation effects propagating wildly is even more of a tribute to them.The film boasts a solid, literate screenplay filled with quirky humor by the wonderful John Sayles. The humor is such that it never slows the film down and does not necessarily need to be commented on, but sharp-eyed viewers and film aficionados will have much to chuckle over without the chills being compromised. Joe Dante's first-rate direction is also a plus. He provides some great atmosphere - whether it be the seedy porn shop where Wallace and the killer first meet or the mist-shrouded lonely woods filled with who-knows-what creeping terror. There are a number of good jolts and suspenseful sequences. The film also crafts some incredibly appealing characters - with the downside being that something dreadful seems to happen to far too many of them.The cast is great. Old pros like John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy and Slim Pickens are on hand, usually playing characters named after directors of past werewolf films. The normally humorous Robert Picardo is terrifying as the demented killer, Eddie. Elisabeth Brooks is both sultry and menacing as the literal man-eater Marsha. Macnee is truly inspirational casting as the pop psychologist who knows more than he lets on. As the central characters, Wallace, Stone, Dugan and Balaski are all sympathetic and appealing. Balaski's mid-film duel with a nasty werewolf is especially adrenaline pumping and it is a shame that the actress has rarely been given a chance to shine in other roles.Watching the film more than three decades after its premiere, it is amazing how well it holds up - both visually and narratively. For my money, this was the last great werewolf film and the subsequent imitators (not to mention an army of increasingly laughable sequels) come off as so much detritus.

Unfortunately, her horror has only just begun, as she soon discovers that the whole place is populated by - wait for it - werewolves, who the doctor in charge (Patrick Macnee) has apparently been trying (and apparently without much luck!) to civilize so that they can fit in. So not only do we have werewolves, they're werewolves who are sort of undergoing therapy for rejection issues!

Boy, was I surprised!The movie was awful! The acting, the story, the pace, the lightning, the cast, the soundtrack... everything! Everything was wrong! It wasn't horrible, but it was bad. The whole feel of the film was that of a really, really cheesy, old horror movie which was just made to cash in some bucks (I'm not saying the movie wasn't made with love, but the it felt that way!).The werewolf transformation scene was awful. Horrible. It didn't look like the guy was going to transform into a werewolf, it looked like he was going to turn into the Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters. Someone said that they liked the Howling transformation scene better because it looked more painful. I disagree. It didn't look the least painful. It kinda looked like the character didn't mind at all. Whereas in AWiL, the character was screaming in agony and you see how painful of a process it was.The ending was also horrible. First of all, the part where they revealed that the whole colony were werewolves. Wow. Original. And the way it was portrayed made it seem like a cheesy Twilight Zone episode. This feeling was kept until the REAL ending (I won't spoil it, but you who have seen the film know what I'm talking about). It was so horrible. So bad. Oh hell...There was ONE redeeming factor. And that was that the werewolves themselves (who didn't appear until an hour into this 89 minute long movie) were really well done. They could move their face really well, and looked like real werewolves (but they didn't look anything like what we were lead to believe by the transformation process). But while watching the movie, I didn't compare it to AWiL, keep that in mind. I just watched it and thought I was in for good werewolf flick. But this wasn't that much of a werewolf flick. I mean, we didn't really see that many werewolves. Maybe four or so. That was about it.I give it a 3 out 10. 2 for the werewolves and 1 for the rest.

Horrible, horrible pacing, stilted acting, and special effects that I suppose for the time were good, but now are absolutely laughable. Not to mention the weird attempts at humour that destroy any mood at all. Is it campy, or earnest? Everything just seemed very superficial. It was like a badly written episode of the TV show McCloud, 'McCloud Meets the Wolfman' or something.Now, it didn't have to be this way. The film that really started it all, The Wolfman, STILL holds up. And the special effects are worse, but it doesn't matter, because it creates a great atmosphere, tells a great story, and never lets up. The best take on the genre in recent years is the Ginger Snaps series, from the Canadians. The writers actually seemed to take werewolves seriously, and produced some really original works.

Then, when the werewolves do come into it, you can already tell who's who and any 'plot twists' that are going to come. The effects are good - for their time.

But there was another masterpiece that sadly came out just after The Howling was released, An American Werewolf In London (1982). Why I'm saying this, because Rick Baker, make-up and special effects was involved in both of them. American Werewolf started earlier then The Howling but had financial problems so Rick started with The Howling but when the director of American Werewolf(John Landis) heard that news money was raised and Barker left The Howling to give it towards Rick Bottin. Rick made it a movie with excellent effects and became notorious surely after The Thing (1982).The Howling wanted to do the werewolf transformation in one shot but money prevented it to become that way. American Werewolf did it. But The Howling was the best known werewolf flick.Although being a classic I prefer American because things starts of immediately. The Howling takes almost 50 minutes before a werewolf comes in and the effects become clear. But I must say that the last 40 minutes are worth watching. What a delight to see.The acting was rather good and the way it was filmed (advised by Bottin to use shadow and not that much of lighting) gave it a creepy feeling. A lot of memorable names are here to see but one that was becoming the next big thing was the werewolf Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks). She was noticed because she went full frontal here but her career was suddenly stopped by cancer, she died age 46.Mixed feelings because it isn't a good movie the first 50 minutes but it's a classic for so many reasons.

Of course there have been great, even legendary, films with lycanthrope antagonists, but that particular sub-genre is rather limited in scope. However, despite the admitted paucity of competition, I can still say with absolute certainty that The Howling is the best movie about werewolves ever made.It makes sense that the film heavily references The Wolf Man, the eternal Lon Chaney Jr./Universal Monsters staple, because The Howling is executed in a way that clearly reveals its acknowledgment of its roots in the traditions of classic horror. The pace is restrained and meticulous, the atmosphere is a character in itself, and despite the film's utilization of creature effects that weren't even dreamed of in Universal's genre heyday, good old-fashioned ensemble acting is what truly drives the action in the piece. If this description makes The Howling sound like a dry production more suited for the theater stage, don't misunderstand me; this is bloody and ferocious fare that will greatly please fans of visceral horror. But it is the taut and well-crafted story, not merely the FX, that make this such a gem, and director Joe Dante is seasoned enough here to allow a gradual and steady immersion into the film's world before bowling us over with Rob Bottin's peerless set-pieces, which have all the more impact when they take command because of how effectively the movie has teased us with tantalizing glimpses throughout.Though the creatures are understandably a feature attraction here, the main focus of the plot is on news anchor Karen White, who has become the fixation of deranged serial killer Eddie Quist and agrees to be used as bait as part of a police operation to capture him. Quist is seemingly killed during her harrowing and macabre encounter, and Karen is subsequently haunted by bizarre dreams and fuzzy, repressed recollections of what actually occurred that night. When she heeds a pop psychologist's suggestion that she and her husband should attend a therapy retreat he oversees at a secluded commune, the getaway does anything but assuage her trauma. Instead, Karen encounters odd and subtly menacing locals and the titular unholy moans emanating from the fog-shrouded forests. It doesn't take long for us to learn that the commune is located at the nucleus of the hunting grounds prowled by a pack of malevolent predatory beasts, and after Karen's husband is seduced and transformed by a sultry lady wolf, her and her visiting reporter friend begin to uncover the sinister secret of the commune.I'll refrain from stepping up on my soapbox to deliver an impassioned soliloquy about how CGI has ruined the art of special make-up FX, but those who appreciate the magic of the wizards who revolutionized the art-form in the late '70s and early '80s will find the work of Rob Bottin here absolutely awe-inspiring. The climactic transformation scene is delivered unflinchingly and in real time, step by grotesque step, and the result is an indelible sequence that remains far more impressive and enthralling than anything modern film-makers handling the same material could ever cook up on a computer. The gore is used sparingly for maximum impact, but whenever it arrives, the results are stunning and gruesome. Perhaps most importantly, the werewolves themselves are a thing of fearsome beauty to behold, monsters that resonate as wholly believable extensions of the established mythology while still maintaining an innovative stroke of originality that makes them belong to this film alone. These creatures aren't merely big wolves, they are eight-foot tall bipedal killing machines with fangs and claws capable of tearing people to shreds, a skill that they demonstrate with acute proficiency during the course of the movie.The performances are all excellent even when the roles veer into the melodramatic, and the presence of one of the power couples of '80s horror, Christopher Stone and Dee Wallace (later Dee Wallace Stone), as well as a marvelous extended cameo from beloved genre vet Dick Miller, will delight fans of the era. Both the gritty, sleazy streets that open the movie and the isolated location housing the commune complex are perfectly presented and utilized, the clues to the greater mystery are unfolded with the taut grace of a top-notch thriller, and the film as a whole feels like an entirely plausible representation of ancient folk lore-based creatures existing in a modern world.The denouement falters slightly since Bottin's best tricks have already been displayed, but the sentiment of the finale is striking enough to end the saga on a dark and tragic note. If your love of the genre goes back to its natal days, be sure to stick around after the credits too, where you'll find a nice coda that bookends the homage to The Wolf Man present throughout these reels.The Howling is, in my estimation, not only the finest and most enduring lycanthropy fable in the canon, it's also quite simply one of the best horror films of all time. Don't skip this one.

Let me tell you, this movie was DREADFUL. For starters, I'd heard great things about the story, plot, and special effects. Not so! I watched it with my Dad, and one of the first things he said was What, was this movie from the 70's?. It only went downhill from there. There was a scene where the edges and wrinkles of the rubber glove was clearly visible when one of the werewolves reached through a broken wooded panel to reach the woman. There was a campfire sex scene - the initial transformations were all right, but then the camera moves back to about 20 feet away, and it is the fakest, WORST computer effects I've EVER seen! The f/x are all right by the time the woman and the remaining officer are in the jeep, trying to escape (the jeep won't start, of course), but still really nothing to write home about.On to the plot and the actual story. I'd read all about how it was so 'original' - wrong again! It begins with a blonde reporter who gets attacked by a psycho while covering a story. She talks to the police, then goes out for a rest at a getaway set up by a reasonably charming psychiatrist - needless to say, pretty much the whole town there is inhabited by werewolves. Now, let me tell you - the movie ran for two hours, but I wish I'd just started watching about 45 minutes in, because everything before that is stupefyingly boring. It can be summed up by Wah, wah, bimbo's scared, gets comforted by boyfriend, lets go for a vacation. They wander around once they get there, and if you're looking for an even remotely spooky set in the wilderness, think again.The action starts pretty much when the boyfriend gets bitten (while he's wandering around in the woods at night by himself, unarmed *eyeroll*). It lasts for all of 20 seconds, and he then stumbles back to their cabin. It's now too painful to recall this horribly boring movie, but let me tell you this there's a cabin that's supposed to be scary, but the hides hanging on the wall just makes it look like a hunter lives there, though the wind chimes made of bones were a little unsettling. Also, even though they're bone, they still jingle as though they were metal chimes. Yea. Oh, while we're on the subject of out-of-place noises, when the werewolves howl, there's also a yowling cat howl in there too. Who knows.Seriously, this movie is not even remotely scary, nor gory, if that's what you're looking for. The goriest thing I recall is when one of the women cuts off the arm of one of the werewolves with an axe, and that *may* inspire a nose-wrinkle of distaste, at best. (And no, I've never seen Saw or Hostel or any of those strictly gore/torture movies, so I'm not speaking from a severely desensitized POV). We gave up on trying to take this movie seriously about a half-hour in, and did what we do best when confronted by a movie this bad - we have our own little Mystery Science Theatre 3000 with it.Anyhow, let me just warn you once more - this movie is REALLY bad! Honestly, I gave it three stars because I enjoyed immensely the scene, props, and acting in the bookstore scene, and for the abrupt improvement of the f/x in the 'trapped in the jeep scene'. I don't know why there's such a lack of werewolf movies, but if you need a fix, let me recommend American Werewolf in Paris (or London), or Underworld.

This today still I note this, that's how impressive both films are at it (and indeed Rick Baker worked on this one for a short while before transitioning over to 'London'). Fans and admirers can argue about the merits or flaws in each film - neither one is entirely perfect - but they are both solid films. In the case of Joe Dante's effort, with the help of co-screenwriter John Sayles, his film mostly trumps comedy for horror. This isn't to say that little moments of hilarity or just random absurdity sprout up from time to time. He creates with his crew such an immediate effect of atmosphere that everything else that comes with it works that much better. It's a creepy little movie.It's about a newscaster (Dee Wallace) who got a kind of close encounter with a serial killer, whom she tracked down for a story to a porno shop and who nearly killed her until the cops come and shoot the man/thing. But then she keeps getting visions of what she saw- or didn't see- and is told by her doctor to go up to The Colony, to relax for a couple of weeks and sit in on some therapy sessions with other people who experienced a similar occurrence. She also goes with her husband, which for him turns out not so well as he's attacked at night by a wolf... which, in turn, makes him one. What we see, and what makes for a nice twist on the conventions of werewolf movies, is that the people don't need to wait for dark or even a full moon to transform, and it's pretty hard to kill it without silver (that last convention still sticks, though to a great result late in the film).What unfolds at this Colony, and in the newscaster's friends' search to find out more about these werewolves and how to kill them, is intriguing stuff, and it's filmed by Dante often with a clever knack for shifting between satire and serious horror. There's a scene at a bonfire on a beach when Karen first comes to the Colony, and we see an old man muttering to himself that he can't go on and threatens to do himself in. This scene is almost funny just by how the guy playing the old man acts and speaks, but it's not a funny scene in the slightest. And when it comes time for Dante and his main make-up guy Rob Bottin (one year before working on The Thing) get to showing what these creatures look like, it's spine-tingling and sometimes bizarre (i.e. werewolf sex scene).If it suffers from anything it's sometimes an almost too-much reliance on in-jokes (sometimes it works like with the Big Bad Wolf cartoon on TV, but a copy of Howl on a desk is a little much), and not the firmest control of the narrative early on in the film (the first ten minutes seem sort of shaky until Karen gets into the porno store). When it gets to the Colony it sticks to being weird and terrifying, and for all of its acting being over the top (Slim Pickens) or flat (Dee Wallace) what counts is its tone and mood. It's more self-conscious about its genre than parody, and it displays how wonderful a filmmaker Joe Dante was right before his big hit with Gremlins.

First of all there is absolutely so contest, An American Werewolf in London is by far the better of the two.  I could not believe how horrible The Howling was.  Frankly, I think the weakness in The Howling was first and foremost the story itself, but I also believe the direction was pretty weak as well.  It's as if they discovered a cool new way to show a werewolf transformation and then show it over and over again to the audience in a strange case of overkill.  This reminds me of the low budget horror film of 1975 called The Devil's Rain, in which they had a technique where characters actually appeared to dissolve, and showed it and re-showed it again and again, tiring the audience.  The Howling does this as well.  However, I must say that the movie is actually not bad, right up until the story shifts to The Colony.  This shift for some reason created disinterest, probably because it seemed too Friday the 13th-ish in this woodsy setting, but also because there is nothing that makes the viewer give a damn about any of these characters.  An American Werewolf on the other hand is by far better.  The humor injected into that film makes it even more horrific.  The one transformation scene was sufficient, and overall, this movie scared me, The Howling bored me.  The viewer become attached to the main character in London and thus producing an even greater sense of horror in that you didn't want this to happen to him.  Also, each of the dream sequences were brilliant that led the viewer to unwilling come to the conclusion that fate was inevitable.

The Howling, in 1981, was a cash-in on the success of John Landis' An American Werewolf in London -- and it's distinctly familiar in its camp humor, human transformations, and even directorial style. This was before Dante had carved a name for himself and it really does just seem like he's copying Landis.... Werewolf in London isn't a great movie but compared to this it does look a great deal better. The Howling involves bestiality, incest, and other uncomfortable subjects and its special effects -- which, at the time, were considered impressive -- are really poor. About three minutes is spent on one transformation, and nowadays it's just really boring. (Although I must say I prefer this stuff to CGI, it's still used too prominently and just isn't as cool as it thinks it is.) The humor is nonexistent. It's just a really cheesy movie with bad acting and Joe Dante has made far better films since. The Howling is generally considered to be some kind of classic of the werewolf genre (there's a werewolf genre??) but I can't classify it as such -- I was hugely disappointed.

Once again, I am relatively impressed with filmmakers like Joe Dante who can make do with very little money, yet The Howling shares the same weakness as many of its predecessors and followers, lack of story, acting and characterization. Maybe I'm being a bit too demanding, I am indeed aware that The Howling is meant simply to entertain in a creepy horror tradition, and at this it does a fairly good job.After a traumatizing encounter with a serial killer, a young newswoman and her husband take a road trip to a rehabilitation center in the coastal wilderness run by the famed Dr. Wagger. It soon becomes apparent that something creepy is lurks within the area, something that howls and eats human flesh, is it human or animal, or both?There are two problems I have with The Howling. Firstly, there are more supporting characters than the story can deal with. Much of the cast does virtually nothing until the last twenty minutes. Secondly, the story runs by a little too quickly. The film needs a couple more scenes in which to flesh out the characters or build up conflict. Overall the movie is relatively suspenseful, though not as much as I think it could have been, and the creature effects are competent for a low budget. Therefore, The Howling is an acceptable little horror flick, offering decent b-movie monster fun, no more no less.

Oh yes, during the early 80's the werewolf was nearing the end of being a staple in horror films. The films of Jacinto Molina (Paul Naschy) marked a long run and a renaissance of werewolf films from the late 60's until it's demise during the early 80's. When Senor Molina had a hard time getting a werewolf film off the ground, the writing was on the wall. But in Hollywood, the love fest with werewolf movies hadn't run it's course. Films like this one and American Werewolf in London redefined this dying genre incorporating state of the art f/x's (courtesy of Rob Bottin and Rick Baker). Instead of a rebirth, the genre died a slow death thanks to the many cheaply made and badly executed films that came out after this one (dare not speak of the horrible films that followed this one bearing the name Howling).The Howling tried something different but the results are a mixed bag. I would rate this movie highly except it's responsible for making a half dozen sequels which range from mediocre to down right unwatchable. The effects are remarkable and the film is full of familiar faces and cameos from people in the biz. It's perfect as a stand alone film. If you love this movie please stay away from the sequels. You'll never forgive yourself if you watched them. Trust me, I wished I never did. I fell on the sword so none of you have to witness the horror. I have seen them all and I wouldn't wish that upon my biggest and nastiest foe.Recommended for horror fans.I repeat, stay away from the sequels!!

Amazing special effects that haven't been topped to this day (not counting CGI), a fantastic & somewhat haunting score, lots of style, plenty of in-jokes, snappy editing, original & creative direction, a brilliant script, a fast pace, and one of the best finales in cinema history are just a few of the ingredients that make this tense & frightening horror film so successful. Loosely based on the book of the same name, this film is about TV reporter Karen White (Wallace) who is being stalked by a maniac named Eddie who fatally bites his victims like a wild animal. The police put a tracer on Karen one night when Eddie forces Karen to meet him. After Karen arrives at their meeting place, Eddie starts to transform into some type of creature, but before he can do any harm to Karen the police come breaking in and shoot Eddie to death. Suffering from shock and memory loss, Karen's doctor (Patrick Macnee) sends her to his small, bizarre village. The residents are a weird bunch, but even weirder is the wolf noises Karen hears late at night and the dead, half ate cattle she keeps finding all over the place. After her husband is attacked by an overgrown wolf Karen comes to slowly realize that just about all the residents are werewolves. To make things worse, Eddie has disappeared from the morgue and appears to be very much alive.Rated R; Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Profanity, Rape, Torture, and Sexual Situations.

A pompous doctor, George Waggner (Patrick Macnee!), invites her to The Colony--a woodland clinic of his to help her get over the shock. Karen and her husband Bill (Christopher Stone) go...unaware that there are wolves roaming around...This is a full throttle horror-comedy with an emphasis on the comedy. It's almost as good as American Werewolf in London. It's fun, has sharp dialogue and constant wolf references (a copy of the book Howl is seen on a desk; people watch The Big Bad Wolf and The Wolf Man on TV). Also The Colony itself is just gorgeous and beautifully atmospheric. In the day it's clear and bright--at night the fog rolls in and it becomes really creepy. Also it playfully injects horror clichés in the movie (I got a big kick out of the sequence in which Karen and a friend get lost in the woods, their flashlight goes out and there's howling in the distance...). It's ALMOST a classic.The problems are many, but the main one is that the film isn't scary--when you see the werewolves they look pretty pathetic. This is supposed to be (partially) a HORROR film--it doesn't help when the main monsters look silly. The transformation scenes look lousy too--but this was over 20 years ago. The story is sort of vague (why does Dr. Waggner invite her to the colony in the first place? It puts her in danger!) and there are plenty of dead spots. It seems too long and it's only 90 minutes! Also Wallace and Stone are not good actors--Wallace's reaction to finding a dead, bloody body is very poor and Stone sleepwalks through his role (although he does very well at a campfire sequence--you'll know it when you see it).So, it has great atmosphere, some very good laughs, John Carradine and some very good cameos (Dick Miller, Roger Corman and Forrest J. Ackerman holding a copy of his magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland) but it's VERY light and insubstantial--you want to see a real movie after this.

She and her husband leave the area, only to enter into a den of werewolves.The film had some big problems for me. The biggest being that as far as horror films go, this one lacked a lot of things one expects from horror. The werewolves do not appear until much later in the film, leaving more than the first half for some other story that seemed to me to have very little connection to the horror theme (though I admit I did not pay as close attention as I probably should have).The other big problem is that I did not know the film would be laced with subtle horror homages. The film Slither had many horror homages, but was very enjoyable even without them. This film seems to rely heavily on the audience getting the in-jokes I missed. I didn't notice the characters were named for actors who were in werewolf movies. I didn't see the photo of Lon Chaney. I didn't notice the copy of the book Howl. And the man who digs for change (Roger Corman), was unrecognizable to me (unfortunately and rather ironically, as I consider Corman the greatest horror director of all time).

Early on we also see a violent porn film, which I think made the film more gritty and disturbing than many horror films of its time.

Why is it that a werewolf can punch through a car roof but can't escape from an old wooden barn while it's burning down? The one thing this film does have going for it is some excellent special make-up effects from Rob Bottin and his team, Rick Baker who did the equally excellent effects for An American Werewolf in London (1981) has a credit as consultant too. The transformation scenes are impressive although there isn't a lot of blood or gore, in fact I can't really remember any. There is someone with half their face burnt off with acid and a chopped off arm and that's about it, but it's definitely the transformations that steal the special make-up effects show. There is a scene where two people start to turn into werewolves as they have sex, which is kinky I guess. It's generally well made and looks OK.

Karen soon gets the impression that something is not quite right in this group and that several members have animal characteristics. Other than a very entertaining and well-elaborated film, The Howling also is a purely ingenious tribute to other genre-classics. Joe Dante brings homage to Universal Pictures (The Wolf Man, WereWolf of London) as well as too Hammer Studios (Curse of the Werewolf) and a whole lot of titles directed by his mentor, Roger Corman. This simply is an excellent film, period. Over twenty years old by now but it still looks fresh and adequate. It has everything tension, atmosphere, a bit of gore and a grim sense of humor. If you're interested in purchasing all the fundamental films that made the horror genre&#133;then add the Howling to your list!

This rot was like all other wolfman films - redundant, boundlessly boring, hackneyed, poorly performed, even more poorly scripted, and finally, just plain silly. Why this garbage gets such high ratings is beyond my range of understanding, but to each his own. This junk was no better than the old Lon Chaney werewolf films from the 40's, and they were pathetic beyond belief. This vomitous bilge should be avoided at all costs. Thumbs way, way down.

It seems like a relaxing and nice resort for travelers but at night, weird things happen involving mysterious murders and wolf howling that occur at night.One of the greatest Werewolf movies of all time! Joe Dante's dark and unique horror story is a different take of the Lyncanthrope myth other then your basic Hollywood retelling of the stories. The Werewolves in this movie can change at anytime and not just during the night, Rob Bottin's make-up effects are amazing and still is today. Joe Dante's direction is fantastic even the performances by Wallace with John Carrdain, Slim Pickens and Dick Miller. This movie with An American Werewolf in London back in 1981 made the Werewolf genre popular again.A real classic! check out this "},{"Title":"The First and Best","Date":"3 December 2008","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Howling, The (1981) *** (out of 4)A newswoman (Dee Wallace) goes to the country to get away from her problems but soon realizes she's in a colony of werewolves. The early 80's featured all sorts of werewolf movies and this here is one of the best, although I don't think it's a major classic like some think. I think there are many long, drawn out and boring scenes here but you can't take away all the great things in the movie. Director Dante does a great job at paying homage to older films from the genre and he plants several in-jokes that fans of classic horror should pick up on. Another big bonus is Dee Wallace who, in my opinion, needs to be called the Scream Queen over Jamie Lee Curtis. Wallace does a great job in her role and really nails all the dramatic moments of the character. The supporting players are good as well but the real charm comes from all the cameos including John Carradine, Kevin McCarthy, Dick Miller, Slim Pickens and others. The special effects also hold up quite well and who will ever forget the sex scene in front of the fire when they slowly turn into werewolves? This here is without a doubt one of the greatest scenes in horror history. "}]
