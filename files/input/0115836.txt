All these family movies have the boilerplate `'I hate you, Dad/Mom'&#133;'save me, Dad/Mom'&#133;'I love you,  Dad/Mom'' subplots, as if they're required by law.  I thought such subplots were dumb when I was young enough to appreciate family movies.  As an 18-year-old, they look even stupider.  I don't think anyone truly gets anything from them.  Even the dumbest jokes were a better investment of time.Still, it's not all bad.  Silly movies like this can be much worse.  The acting was decent, assuming that several actors were still kids.  It's sad that they did a career-crushing film like this.  Of the five kids, only Rachael Leigh Cook has had a remotely notable role since (`She's All That,' almost three years later).  As for the adults, I was impressed with Rod Steiger and David Paymer, but couldn't they find something better?Most would be horrified to think about a sequel, but with so much to improve, I doubt it could be worse.  (Maybe Kayla, now in her late teens, fills in for the carpool and Chelsea and Travis are now teens, with new little kids to take their place.  The hijacker could be an early-20's guy so he can have a love/hate relationship with Kayla.  You groan, but would you rather a cheesy parent/child relationship?)  These are just my ravings even if you could get the actors to return, the reputation of the original would still be there.  Then again, maybe the public has forgotten after four years.My overall impression this movie is as mediocre as it gets; just how so depends on your age group.  Kids will enjoy the bad jokes.  Adolescent boys will enjoy Kayla's outfit.  Everyone else it won't kill you, but there has to be at least one better tape in the store.Parents be advised that family movies are not the best way to spend time with your kids; this one is no exception.My rating 5.

Now when I saw it on TV after all these-years, When I itself started to watch films like 'Ben Hur', 'Casablanca' etc, I consider this 1996 flick to be a weak effort.'Carpool' is not a terrible film, but it's not good either. However, Kids of my age back then, enjoyed themselves. In terms of 'Screenplay' & 'Direction', this flick offers nothing magnificent and I can confirm you that the Makers didn't intend to make a 'milestone' film anyway. Their intension was to make Kids laugh, and of what I remember, the kids did.Arthur Hiller's direction as well as the screenplay offer nothing great. For some reason, Tom Arnold won a Razzie-Award for Worst Actor for his performance in here, while David Paymer delivered a truly good performance. David Paymer is amongst the most under-rated actors of his time. The kids did a fine job.On the whole, A film that never will be talked about, and I guess it never even wanted to be Evergreen.

One morning, his wife gets the flu, leaving him responsible for getting his children dressed, fed, and dropped off at school. He fumes about this, for he has an all-important meeting at ll00 am. Nevertheless, he piles his two boys, along with three neighbor kids (its Dan's turn to be the carpool driver) into the van and stops for doughnuts for everyone to have a good breakfast. Trouble is, at the bakery, there is a hold-up, with Franklin (Tom Arnold) taking the money and taking Daniel hostage, too, to complete a getaway. Franklin is really a nice man but his failing carnival show necessitated the immediate need for funds. Daniel is aghast for he still has his meeting looming on the horizon. After having the kids spray-paint the van purple, to allude authorities, Daniel, Franklin, and the kiddies drive around and around. Will they be caught? And, why does Daniel's children like Franklin better than they like their own father? This movie has a good concept that is, unfortunately, not matched by the film's ultimate execution. The idea that a robber would end up in a mundane carpool routine is infectious but the film's plot line runs thin, at times. Nevertheless, Paymer is a good performer, as is Arnold, who always garners smiles. The children are lively and fun, as well, and the movie's costumes, scenery, and photography make for a good-looking film. To be brief, families will probably enjoy a showing of this flick, for it has humor, chase-scenes, car crashes, and other attention-getting devices. But, it is doubtful that anyone will ask for a repeat showing.

The film just fills me with a gleeful warm sense of satisfaction. I particularly enjoy the Mall scene where Franklin drives the people carrier into the hordes of poor shoppers!This film really does shine out from other genres within the mid-90's era of comedy. We see here a delightful microcosm, a delectable pastiche capturing the endless hilaritys of two 'star crossed' people coping with the madcap situation which life has bestowed them on this darkest of days.Hiller actually makes you care about the characters, crazy but lovable Franklin (Tom Arnold gives an outstanding performance) with his wacky driving, Daniel with his all so cautious but semi-professional 'keeping it together attitude.' The screaming kids in the back just add to the foreground of this delightful and mystical journey on which we are taken though 90 minutes of mayhem! With a team of talented writers with the likes of Don Rhymer, you know you're just being given gold! I personally would rate this film 9.5, but that's not for the likes of me to decide. I would thoroughly recommend this film to any friend, and will probably be purchasing on DVD as soon as possible.

Apparently he needed money to get his circus up and going. Police catch on and what follows is The Cannonball Run with new rules.

I liked this one, and so much to be frank. This script has it all. We follow a hostage situation, leads on the run, teen love story, odd couple comedy, bad guys vs. good guys, big fight in a carnival, from zero to hero, rescue in the nick of time, happy ending. And the beautiful thing is that all of that worked too. There were good casting, lines, and chases. However what did overtop everything was the way how this movie mixed comedy with action. Important to mention that it has one of the greatest jumps ever done by a car in the history of cinema; and of course I mean the one which ends the mall's sequence. That was ultra enjoyable and totally unforgettable. David Paymer was born to play that beaten executive and exhausted father. Tom Arnold played that slick desperate carnival owner-turned-criminal finely and, believe it or not, he was funny ! The younger team was fabulous. And the real dessert was Rod Steiger as the scary (naturally) tycoon Mr. Hammerman, a role that couldn't be sweeter without his presence. He won a character which looked like a parody of his film persona, and this movie won him as it too. Wait for his last scene, it's a lovely surprise !So it's nice fun. And when it comes to Arnold; rare nice fun! Therefore, why all the HATE?!!! I may ascribe not being a commercial hit to the 2 leads' not so flashy charisma; which's the movie's possible flaw. But I still don't know why (Carpool) wasn't fairly appreciated, as a whole, by anyone? There is such a nasty superiority towards it, while praising pure crap produced under the name of art ! I read that Rotten Tomatoes' critics gave it a 0% rating. Well, 0% rating from me to them then !Finally, watching a good Tom Arnold movie equals seeing actual UFO.

The character actor best known for his Oscar-nominated role as Billy Crystal's brother in Mr. Saturday Night is easily the best thing in this otherwise mediocre comedy. The movie gets off to a good start. Paymer plays a workaholic dad who has to make a big presentation at work. But his big day gets off to a bad start when (while in a hurry to get to work) his wife complains that she's sick and forces him to take her place in the carpool. So he, along with his own two sons, picks up three kids, and it's off to school. Right from the getgo Paymer looks like he's going through alot of stress as he has no choice but to put up with the five rambunctious kids. But then things take an unexpected turn. Paymer stops off at a place known as a gourmet market to get some food for the kids to eat on the way to school. Then a goofy carnival owner played by Tom Arnold comes in, botches a hold-up, and in the process takes Paymer hostage. When they try to leave, Arnold's truck is blocked in by another vehicle. So what else is he to do? Simple. He uses Paymer's van with the kids in it to get away which begins a long chase all day long. And the movie goes somewhat downhill from there, but it doesn't go downhill disasterously. This is one silly movie. Arnold was very good in sidekick roles in True Lies and Nine Months, but he hasn't been as effective in leading roles. In Carpool he's O.K., but better than he was in Big Bully, The Stupids, and McHale's Navy. Cheers' Rhea Perlman turns up halfway through the movie as a meter maid who joins in on the chase. Her character is basically a cartoon, and she deserved better. And what on earth is Rod Steiger doing in this movie? The Oscar-winning actor comes in for a bit part that is totally pointless. The five young actors who play the carpooled kids (which includes Rachael Leigh Cook from She's All That) range from likable to totally annoying. Still, the thing I liked the most about Carpool is David Paymer. He's naturally funny everytime he's on screen. Also, another funny element in the film is the voice of Kathleen Freeman as Arnold's insane mother. The weirdest thing about this character is that you never see her face, and the character is voiced not only by Freeman, but two other actresses as well (Edie McClurg and Miriam Flynn). Why didn't the filmmakers just have Freeman do the entire voiceover of this character? Why does this character have to have three different voices? That doesn't make sense. Freeman's voice is easily the funniest because it comes from a terrific veteran actress. Carpool is an average comedy with some laughs from time to time and a hilarious performance by Paymer, but it's all too silly.**1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Abysmal","Date":"17 July 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I only saw this movie once years ago.
