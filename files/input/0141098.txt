[{"Title":"conventional romance with a surprise brave ending","Date":"22 February 2000","Score":"38 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  In Forces of Nature, Ben Affleck stars as Ben, a repressed, buttoned-up stuffed shirt writer who, through a series of natural and manmade mishaps, ends up spending the several days before his impending marriage in the company of a freespirited, totally spontaneous and liberated young woman named Sarah, played by Sandra Bullock.  For the vast majority of the film's running time, the screenplay follows the conventions of the opposites-attract scenario almost slavishly.  The script even provides Ben's fiancee with an overly-convenient replacement in the form of a now-hunky childhood friend she has not seen in years who rekindles sparks with her on the eve of the wedding.Thus, the stage is set for the predictable true love romantic finale.  But, damn, if the writers don't pull the rug out from under us and shatter the time-honored cliche.  This is particularly surprising because, up to now, the film has exhibited no trace of iconoclasm in either its plot or character development.  In fact, the screenplay is less a full-fledged narrative than a series of photographic montage sequences strung lazily together as Ben and Sarah engage in one cutesy situation and encounter after another.  Thus, the unconventionality of the resolution comes as an even more stunning surprise than it otherwise might.Affleck and Bullock are very appealing as two young people who complement each other's strengths and weaknesses and who learn to offer one another valuable life lessons.  Forces of Nature emerges as one of those rare films that is, perhaps bizarrely, actually better in retrospect than in the watching.

Due to the delay Ben's fianc√©, Bridget, flies ahead to Savannah to make the preparations.  Ben catches a plane later the day and meets free-spirit Sarah.  When the plane is in a minor crash the two join up to head to Savannah by any way other than road, leading to one `comic' delay after another.  Meanwhile the two become a little closer and Ben begins to doubt that marriage is for him.I first saw this in the cinema with my girlfriend (at the time) in a fit of trying to be seen to be giving and willing to watch silly films that she wants to see.  At the time I was particularly untaken by the whole film despite the odd amusing touch.  A few years on she bought it on video &#150; she likes the silly films she can watch with her friends &#150; and I gave it another go.  The film is sadly as poorly pitched as I remember it, it isn't light enough to be funny and it isn't well enough written to be an involving drama.  However, by trying to do both it fails to do either well.The light part is clearly indebted to `Planes, Trains & Automobiles' in it's make-up, with cross country japes and one mishap after another.  However to even compare the laughs in that film with the low number in this is, well, laughable.  The film tries to have some `hilarious' set pieces but none of them are more than amusing.  Even the support characters who wander in and out only ever manage a few good lines.  What makes this harder is the serious side to the film where Sarah has a child and an abusive husband and Ben gets nothing but advice not to marry.  This element is present all the way through and makes the film much more of a drama than a comedy, but, because it wants to be funny as well, the drama doesn't really work very well.Affleck is a non-character here and doesn't have the charisma to really involve the audience.  Bullock is normally good but this is outside of her normal character and she doesn't wear the difficult edges well.  The two have a reasonable chemistry that helps them through the rough patches but they don't fizz or spark together.  The support cast throws up a few interesting faces who give good performances including Ronny Cox, Zahn, Tierney and a few others.The film has been applauded for the realistic (low-key) ending which is certainly better on paper than the usual formulaic ending and on this I pretty much agree.  It doesn't spoil the film simply because the 30 minutes before this are so very serious and not funny.  On top of this the film also has some nice directorial touches in slow-mo rain and hail storms.  However the impact of the emotional climax in a swirling wind of flower petals is rather spoilt by the really poor back projection used to carry it off.Overall though this film is a bit of a letdown as it manages to only half work as a comedy and as a drama although it does have some nice touches that make it worth seeing as long as you know what to expect.

We didn't have high expectations, except to be entertained. And we found it very entertaining and not particularly predictable. Affleck, the prospective groom, has to make his way to Savanna in two days after a plane problem, complicated by an arriving hurricane. He meets up with the ditsy Bullock, and both of them learn quite a bit about themselves. If you watch the special features on the DVD, Bullock explains how every one you meet, even short chance meetings, have some impact on you, and this is a large part of what the movie tries to convey. And it does it very well. There's good acting, lots of interesting developments, and a very good story in total. I give it 7 of 10. It is a much better movie than I expected.The DVD picture is very well done, and the sound track likewise, with appropriate use of the rear surround channels. My only complaint?

It sounded extremely trite, and I'm not too interested in Bullock or Affleck either. I was very surprised at the sharp dialogue and humor. And even though every frame of this film looked like a jeans commercial, I *liked* the cinematography and hip, colorful locales. Of course the whole thing was totally unbelievable and the various events that occur are a bit overdone... but I liked it anyway. I am a sucker for road movies, so that was part of the appeal for me... traveling, different locations (the laundromat, the snack bar with the giant globe and the Big KMart at 2AM). I expected Ben's bride-to-be to be a crashing bore or uptight priss, so the audience would root for Sarah and Ben. But she was funny and sharp also, and you don't feel like the marriage would suck all the life out of Ben as it seemed to have for others in the film. All of the things Ben overhears about marriage sucking is pretty funny. I only post here about movies that make an impression on me, whether good or bad... and this one made an impression. I liked it. And no one is more surprised about that than me.

The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always.  Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.  Sandra Bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany, but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her child, going on carnival rides, offering to strip for money, and bumming a ride with a fellow airline passenger.  The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring.  It introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them off before they could develop.  To top it all off, the twist at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy.  If you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it, as I did, my advice is don't go to the movie.  It will only spoil a nice trailer.

Not having even heard of this movie, and not being able to figure out why I haven't, I proceeded to discover a third reason for watching it Maura Tierney. It is she that makes the movie work.  Let me back up a little. The chance encounter and evolving relationship between the two principal characters follow a familiar track. Even then, clich√© notwithstanding, the movie was terribly funny to watch. (Also remember that I had to watch it under the barbarous conditions of constant TV commercial interruption, and with no ability to pause it at the times I wanted to). The team of Affleck and Bullock (and particularly the latter) was the reason. The role fit Bullock like a glove, and we see her at her very best. In addition to the funny parts, the `showdown' scene in which they gave each other a piece of their minds, while again quite predictable, was well acted with a good mix of fire and poignancy. The ending, which I really like, while on the surface coming across as an unpredictable twist, was not entirely out of the blues, and here we come back to Tierney. This actress has so much unexplainable charm (at least in this movie) that subconsciously, we empathize a lot with her. But it's also Affleck and Bullock (credit to all three of them) that accomplish a delicate balance that lifts this movie a notch above its peers. The ending scene is simply beautiful.

If narrated believably, this might have been a great film.Where the film fails is in actually showing that Ben loves his bride and also making it believable that he loves Sarah (I love Bullock, but I failed to see that a character like Ben was really attracted to Sarah enough to jeopardize his marriage). So just before the end, the situation presents itself as a decision between Ben marrying a woman without us knowing anything about their relationship, or leaving her at the altar for another woman for which he did not have believable romantic feelings. Not really a way to make us care for the result.Still, the ending made some kind of sense out of the story fragments that had been shown before and did a lot to reconcile me with this film.

Affleck, on the other hand, irritated me a bit.  He came across as weak, crap, and silly on most occassions.  A lot off pple say Sandy carried the entire film on her shoulders - I could agree.  Without the character 'Sara' the film would be lost, as I say most of the film suddenly revolves around her and her personality.  I also love Sara's make up style.  I would say because Sandy naturally has strong, bold features, she was able to carry it off, esp with brown eyes.....and it worked!

But this is how I saw it  a guy going to get married, but we can see in his face hes dreading it, disaster strikes at airport, Sara was there and to me Sara saved him.....in a sense, as someone said here, she made him see how he had cold feet. Of course she has her own personal probs and the scene where she meets Karl, made me feel embarrassed for her, in how Karl said what he said. No-one likes to be made to look a baffoon in front of strangers.  And the two most likely had this physical attraction grow between them, but mentally were not suited to each other.Sara has a very quirky, funny, free-spirit, good-humoured type of personality......so as Ben is stuck with her he sees just how much she is different from Bridgette, and very attractive too!  Remember this is a film, I know so many pple out there want films to be very realistic, but sometimes the odd magical special-effects film where there is fun in a story of a journey can be a nice break and refreshing to watch!

I have already seen this phenomenon with certain films from the seventies and early eighties which are now considered with far more respect and awe than at the time they actually came out.I would not go so far as to say that the film is some great work of art and do have criticisms with regard to it, but several viewings of the work have brought me to re-assessing my initial reaction. The first thing we may say is that the sound track is MAGNIFICENT but I would hasten to add that it is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME buying the CD soundtrack as half the damned tracks are MISSING from the CD ! Why no-one complains about this sort of thing I will never understand ! A CD entitled sound track should contain all the music from the film, it's not as if we were talking about extracts only ........The beginning of the film does start out chatty, too fast, over noisy,flippant, and rather shallow, however when the film settles down to crusing speed,there are some genuinely romantic moments and my favorite passage of all is when our two protagonists are staying with the party of elderly people in a luxury motel and dancing to the beautiful music of Ruben Gonzales ( Siboney / Melodia del R√≠o ), and of course they end up underwater in the swimming pool ! That is superb ! Other nice moments are when they are shopping in the K-Mart together, a very funny time in the gay night-club ( hilarious ) the scene where they are both talking together in the bushes just before Afleck goes off to his wedding in the hurricane and of course the bit at the end where Bullock finally meets up and is accepted by her little son. I could not remain untouched by these scenes.To go back to the dance scene with Ruben Gonzales, Bullock gives advice to Affleck about how to cope with his wife and married life in general. I was most touched by this scene ( the music surely helped me along ) and found the dialogue to be most authentic.The bad weather during the wedding scene causes some anguish but is well filmed, notably the slow-motion hailstones and normally you will notice that in films, weddings are filmed in sunny weather ( and funerals in the rain ) as sun is supposed to be a sign of optimism and rain, sadness ( but this can of course depend on the country where you live ). To see a wedding, or to be more precise, wedding preparations, in the rain and wind, then is surprising to say the least.In conclusion, then, the film without being a major work of art, has far more to commend it than to condemn it despite the initial twenty minutes or so being totally uninteresting and flippant. I think it WILL stand up to the test of time and will be far more appreciated in due course than at present.

From start to finish, this is one of the freshest, most sincere, exciting, approachable and lighthearted romance films I have ever seen. The relationship between the two is never quite defined, and the dialogue and actions from almost everyone in the film puts their relationships under scrutiny.It does this in a considerate, intelligent way, though, and at the end, I was left with an appreciation of both new experiences and the social structure I depend on and will continue to.The end was brilliant, and the scene on top of the train (and when she is beckoning Ben to come up there), is one of my favorite of all time.

In other words, whatever can go wrong, does go wrong. This tradition includes the likes of The Out-of-Towners and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. In these movies - usually comedies - the principal characters are bedeviled by a series of obstacles which threaten to derail their plans; the obstacles range from human malfeasance to natural disasters. As the title strongly suggests, the primary obstacles in this movie are courtesy of Mother Nature. The probability of just one of the unfortunate events is extremely low. The probability of all of them occurring within the space of two days is nonexistent. (The antecedents of this tradition predate cinema by several thousand years, of course. Remember the trials of Job, and the plagues of the Old Testament. Indeed, at one point Ben says something about waiting for the locusts to come.) As Forces of Nature begins, Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) and Bridget Cahill (Maury Tierney) are about to be married. Ben lives in New York; Sarah is from Savannah, Georgia, where the wedding is to take place. Everyone is on edge because a hurricane brewing in the Atlantic threatens to wreak havoc on the impending nuptials. Two days before the event, Ben boards a plane for the trip south. As luck would have it, a hapless seagull is sucked into one of the plane's engines, and it skids off the runway, resulting in minor injuries. One of the passengers is a young woman named Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock), who is en route to Florida to transact some business. Following the crash, she credits Ben with saving her life. Concerned about the possibility of another aviation mishap, they decide to share the cost of a rental car. There are no cars available, but they meet a man who already has one, and he agrees to drive them to their destinations. From this point on, the aforementioned Murphy's Law intervenes with a vengeance.If Forces of Nature were nothing but a succession of calamities, it would be funny, but nothing to write home about. On another level, however, it is an exceptional movie with a great deal of heart. There is a tradition for this type of movie, as well, and it includes It Happened One Night, which won an Oscar for Best Picture in 1934. The worst thing that can happen to anyone about to be married is to fall in love with someone else. Ben finds Sarah enchanting and unique, and soon he develops feelings for her. To make matters worse, nearly everyone he meets has a horror story about marriage. Before long, Ben's pre-wedding jitters turn into a panic, and he is in turmoil. The hurricane gaining strength off the coast of Georgia is nothing compared to the storm wreaking havoc on Ben's peace of mind. To paraphrase Hamlet, To wed or not to wed, that is the question.Ben Affleck is not an especially exciting actor (in my opinion), but in this movie he is very convincing as a man in the throes of indecision. Sandra Bullock is terrific as a free spirit who turns out to have more depth than you might expect. The supporting cast is entertaining, as well, and the dialogue is witty and intelligent. If you can forgive the director and writer for straining the limits of credulity with a preposterous plot, you should find this a very funny and poignant film.

Yes, it is clich√©d, the plot has been done many times before, the script is often disjointed and has more holes than a Swiss cheese, the characters are left half painted, the actors are playing to type (though that never hurt Bob Hope, Cary Grant, Carole Lombard, etc., etc) and elements of the story seem to be largely superfluous (the most egregious example being the climactic hurricane); but it is a romantic comedy... and I found it both romantic and gently funny in places. The weaknesses in the script and the editing can't be laid at the casts feet; and they perform really well. Sandra Bullock and Benn Affleck's romance isn't the most believable you'll come across, but they do work well together and have the chemistry needed to carry the heavily flawed plot. It also should be noted that very little in the story is believable; so much so that, at one point, Affleck and Bullock arrive at a bank where Ben Affleck is due to pick up some money that will enable them to get to Savannah, only to find the bank engulfed in flames. They turn to each other and laugh at the sheer improbability of it all; it's as if the characters are momentarily saying to the audience, yeah! we know that you know that it's all so fantastical and contrived... so don't worry, it's meant to be. Lazy script writing or a foray into the realm of magical realism? The former I suspect, but the film obviously set out to have a fairy tale quality about it, and it has enough charm, wit and warmth to compensate for the holes in the script. Sadly many of the comical shoots do seem to inexplicably wither before they get a chance to bear fruit, but the comedy is without exception well-played by the cast. It just needed tighter scripting.I can't believe it has such a poor rating on IMDb - it has many faults, but I was contented to spend an hour-and-a-half watching Sandra Bullock looking lovely and being charming and witty on screen. Compared to so much of the exploitative, clich√©d, adolescent, emotionally empty, fantasy violence out there that gets higher ratings, 'Forces of Nature' is Palm D'Or material... maybe it's rather naff title hasn't helped it...

Not without its moments","Date":"12 April 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Forces of Nature is a very unusual romantic comedy. Unusual in that it seems determined to avoid all the natural conventions you would expect from the genre. In fact as I watch it, there's something about the film that places it just a little outside the mainstream. I don't mean it would be embraced by the indie crowd. Especially with stars like Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck at the helm. But it is not your standard rom-com.Forces of Nature is a film that borrows a few plot lines from the superb Planes, Trains & Automobiles. But instead of a businessman trying to get home for Thanksgiving saddled with an annoying travelling companion, instead we have a man trying to get to his wedding, and meets a free spirited woman along the way who might just be the girl of his dreams.Ben Holmes (Affleck) is an uptight publisher on his way to Savannah to be married to his fianc√©e Bridget. But the plane he's on never even gets off the ground when a pigeon gets sucked into the engine turbine. Seated next to him is Sarah (Bullock), one of these eccentrics you tend to meet on public transportation.Ben is unwilling to wait for another flight to Savannah, and since she's headed in the same direction, Sarah wants to help Ben get to his wedding on time. But of course, their journey proves to be anything but smooth, filled with detours, jail cells and all night K-Marts.Although Forces of Nature is slightly predictable, I do have a certain affection for the film. Perhaps because it is willing to take the whole romantic comedy genre in strange directions. Sandra Bullock, one of my favourite actresses, is no stranger to rom-coms. But in this film, she plays a slightly more edgier character than what I've seen of her previous work.Sarah is the complete opposite of Ben. Where he is a tense, uncertain man who has to think everything through, Sarah is an impulsive, free-thinking spirit who goes with the flow. But her willingness to be so spontaneous sometimes leads to problems. Like the scene when a train they're on stops in the middle of the track, and she actually climbs on top of one of the carriages and invites Ben up just to feel alive. But the carriages are uncoupled and they end up seriously sidetracked.Forces of Nature does have some unexpected depth. Granted the screenplay is a little contrived the way it keeps throwing up obstacles to prevent Ben from reaching his wedding. Its all designed to keep Ben and Sarah in each others company. But that comes with the territory. And we do find out some surprising things about Sarah over the course of the film.Naturally of course, the more time Ben and Sarah spend with each other, they begin to open up to each other, and a strange sort of attraction develops. But not exactly love. Sarah helps Ben to loosen up, and Ben begins to question whether or not marriage is such a good idea now. But FON raises some fascinating and unexpected left field turns.Ben believes he may be falling in love with Sarah, but she doesn't agree. After all, they've only known each other for inside of two days. How could he possibly love a complete stranger who only just walked into his life a short time ago? She helps Ben to reexamine his feelings for Bridget, and make the right choice in the end.FON is never as outright funny as it should be. But then maybe its not trying to be. It tries to ground the trappings of a romantic comedy in more serious surroundings. Its nowhere near as successful as the wonderful Lost in Translation, but FON does have some pleasant surprises in store. Bullock is terrific, and plays one of her most fascinating characters to date, and although Affleck is as stolid as ever, at least its in keeping with the character he's supposed to be playing.The ending is a little downbeat, especially for Sarah's character. I genuinely did feel real sadness for her in the end. Bullock does such a great job of fleshing out Sarah's character I was left with genuine concern over her future.Forces of Nature is no classic, but it does have some unexpected merits. It would be a shame if it faded into obscurity.

Few Hollywood celebs take relationships and marriages seriously, and they seem to last only until the next casting comes along. I never saw a movie with so many negative remarks about marriage, and with Ben Affleck's romance record, he could have written the script all by himself. While the movie had its funny and oh, not again moments, there just seemed to be that underlying feeling that Ben's marriage may never happen and he has discovered that his buddies are right..Why tie yourself down to one woman when there are so many others out there interested in you. Even when Ben decided that he'd better do the right thing and marry his fianc√©e, he just didn't seem to make the decision with all his convictions. It's definitely art imitating life when it comes to love commitments in Hollywood. As far as all the symbolism many people have written about here, it's just hard to take any of it seriously in this love farce of a movie. The only symbolism that I took to heart was Stephen Stills' song of free love. So if you're down and confused (and just waiting for something to do) on commitment and marriage, and you think that Sandra Bullock is hot enough to break up a romance, then Forces of nature is the perfect movie for you.

Inevitably, Ben begins to question his decision to marry Bridget as he finds himself falling for Sarah.This is about the 736th reworking of an idea first filmed 65 years before in It Happened One Night, only with a few MTV interludes punctuating modern day sensibilities that would never have got past the censor back in the 30s. There's no wall of Jericho here, just a frosted glass window through which Affleck watches Bullock disrobe. Affleck, the world's most natural friend-of-the-hero supporting actor is once again unaccountably promoted to the part of leading man and finds himself out of his depth with even the shallow demands made on him by the film's character. He comes across as nice enough, but there's nothing memorable about him and notwithstanding this being an opposites attract flick, it's difficult to see what Sarah would see in such a buttoned-up character.While Forces of Nature would win few awards for originality, it manages to avoid becoming simply a series of mishaps filmed for comic effort. Stuff like that quickly becomes tiresome as the likelihood of serial misfortunes besetting one couple grows increasingly unbelievable, but here we at least have the occasional detour for reflections on marriage for its own sake versus being true to oneself. It's a hoary old topic to be sure, but it at least gives a little depth to what would otherwise be the lightest and most inconsequential of movies. And writer Marc Lawrence at least manages a neat reversal of viewer's expectations with an unexpected climax that nevertheless makes a mockery of everything that has gone before.

How long have they been around? I am sure since the dawn of cinema romance has been played out way too many times on film.  So many people complain they are unoriginal, that the formula is tired and lame. My question to those people is this, why the heck do you go see this type of movie in the first place? In Forces of Nature's case was it because Sandra Bullock looked damn hot in the preview or Ben Affleck looked like he was actually going to stretch his acting range? Why? I really do hate when people rag on this genre of film because honestly its dependable, you know what your gonna get, its comfort food for the soul.  I have seen my fair share of bad romantic comedies, but let me tell you Forces of Nature is one that has its head in a creative fast lane.   Not only is it great to look at, with slow motion sequences and imaginative special effects, but also the story is one that I didn't expect.  The story is present to show you the cold feet of Ben (Ben Affleck) and a woman, Sarah (Sandra Bullock), who makes him understand it. There trip from the airport, takes them through all kinds of over the top weather, but it is all part of a metaphoric journey of understanding love and marriage.  I admit some of the movie does dabble in some less than stellar scenes involving Ben's Fianc√©e Bridget (Maura Tierney) and her ex-boyfriend Steve (the late David Strickland), but it doesn't bring the overall story down.  While its true that the audience doesn't quite understand the relationship between engaged love birds Ben and Bridget, that is hardly something you can complain about since its not the point of the movie, the story is about Ben's journey and his ice cold feet. I enjoyed the movie for what it was instead of trying to imagine that it could be this uncliched masterpiece, because I find most romantic comedies are derivative to certain point anyway.  The title sequence by Kyle Cooper (the director of New Port South) does a brilliant job with colour and substance, which perfectly matches with the rest of the film. Cinematographer Elliot Davis, wow, does an amazing job here with coloured lenses.  Forces of Nature is a great film, full of rain, thunder and sunshine, which is exactly how love can feel at times.

If you are looking for a fun movie that actually has some profound things to say about life, this is a good one.The plot is a simple one, and somewhat worn a man (Ben Affleck) is trying to get from New York to Savannah for his wedding, and everything in the universe seems to be conspiring to keep him from getting there, and to convince him not to get married.  Meanwhile, his fiancee is being wooed by her old boyfriend in Savannah while a hurricane is bearing down on the planned outdoor wedding.Along the way, Affleck finds himself traveling with a totally free spirit (Sandra Bullock,) while one disaster after another befalls them.  Affleck starts to fall for Bullock, of course, while every single person or thing in the universe is telling him that getting married is a bad idea -- including Bullock herself.  Each learns some things from the other, and eventually they get to the wedding and the movie's conclusion.If that were all there were to the movie, it would get a mediocre rating from me.  Neither Bullock nor Affleck really shine in this movie, although their chemistry is pretty good, and the plot is fairly stale. Fortunately, there is a lot more to be had there.All I will say about the ending is that it is not what you expect.  There is a theme throughout the movie, however, and that seems to be what holds it all together, and turns an okay movie into a very good one.The title of the movie says what this film is about.  It is about forces of nature -- things you cannot control, and can only live with, like hurricanes, seagulls, lightning strikes, hailstorms, etc.   What I thought was obvious -- but apparently is not -- is that Sandra Bullock's character Sarah is the principal force of nature the movie is about.Sarah is a living tornado, a dynamic, spinning, agent of chaos.  She is a very fun-loving person, but is suffering from the consequences of being that kind of person.  Being that way has a price you don't often see in the movies. She is not only a free spirit, she is in a great deal of pain as the result of her past free actions.  Ben's character (Ben) is a book cover blurb writer, who is in just as much pain from his dweebish lifestyle, except that he doesn't know it.We have a classic pairing of the free spirit with the anal retentive, letting each learn from the other, but what both have to learn is how to live with forces of nature.  Ben must learn how to go with the flow of the disasters life throws at him, to enjoy himself, and not to worry much about maintaining his balance.  Sarah must learn that she *is* a force of nature, that she causes wreck and ruin, but that she also has to learn to regain her balance after the ride to take responsibility for the consequences of her actions.The formula of this pairing is an ancient one, but this movie takes what they learn to a much more healthy conclusion than you normally find. Perhaps disappointing if you just want a romantic fluff movie, it has some very good things to say, and yet has enough fluff to be interesting to the I want fluff crowd.

I love the scene with the couple on the train (how you think at first that they are a cute, married couple but actually are cheating on their spouses together), the man on the plane who complains about his wife, and Vick in the Volvo who also complains about his marriage. Affleck's character tries so hard to be a good guy, but here he is caught up in a whirlwind of strange events, all of which seem to be trying to keep him from ever reaching his wedding.

I think the biggest mistake the movie made was giving Sandra Bullock a life.  It could have been much more intriguing had she been only a Force of Nature and we didn't have to deal with the pointless scenes involving her husband and child. The scene towards the end with Affleck and Tierney at the wedding was absolutely wonderful, and should have been the end.

But this is no Dogma, no Good Will Hunting...hell, even his role in 200 Cigarettes is more memorable. Ben proves the age old theory that the best actor in the world does not a good film make. Basically, the story is horrid. The script is horrid. Add that to the fact that I can't stand Sandra Bullock (scrawny and one-dimensional) and that makes an awful film. The upside? Maura Tierney's really cute and I really like Steve Zahn. That's about it. The story is absolutely ridiculous; why do writers feel the need to overdo and over-dramatize *everything*. Excessively melodramatic (the shining light through the hurricane onto Affleck and Tierny made me gag) and excessively unbelievable. I hate it when 'everything goes wrong' films don't leave any room for reality. Every five minutes some new mishap or disaster happened, and they were usually awkward and eye-rolling. And when a little bit of story actually started to take place, it was interrupted by yet another misadventure... And the film was *way* too loooooooong!! Nearly two hours of non-stop schlock. Could've chopped an easy 20 minutes off of it. Overall, I'd recommend a pass on this one. There are some really cheezy sentimental films out there that are still enjoyable despite any excess or melodrama. This isn't one of them.

No, I enjoyed this movie for one reason, the supporting cast.  Blythe Danner as mother of the bride is elegant, graceful, real, and lovely as always.  We see where her daughter gets her talent.  Steven Zahn is hilarious.  I never cease to be entertained by his sharp-wit and perfect timing.  But most of the credit for saving this film belongs to Maura Tierney.  Her scenes provide much welcome respites from the ridiculous antics of Affleck and Bullock.  Tierney is wry and funny, not to mention terribly appealing.  The audience finds itself rooting for her happiness and cursing Affleck's boneheaded attempt at a tryst.  Tierney's performance adds a much needed earth to a film that spends most of its time on the fringes of the clouds.  She grounds it gracefully, creating the center of mass around which all other insanities and adulteries and abnormalities can revolve, because she is sure of two things...  herself and her love for her fiance.  Maura Tierney makes it worth the rent, Blythe Danner and Steven Zahn help it breathe...  now all you have to do is ignore the stars of the film.

This is first a road picture with almost as many pitfalls as Planes, Trains and Automobiles. So the relationship between Affleck and Bullock is more stormy than warm and there is a touch of reality that isn't covered up in the typical style of a romantic film.Forces of Nature cleverly juggles the road relationship between the stars with the wedding build up in Savannah Georgia. The surprisingly good special effects build on themes of life's unpredictability as well as creating some magical scenes. I especially liked the dry humor of the movie, because if you don't cry, what can you do except laugh. Also, there is a bit of light shed on the pressures of weddings and the problems of marriage mostly done in fun.Bullock has a tough role with a very wide range from wild to sympathetic. She pulls it off fairly well. While Affleck is not the greatest actor, he was believable enough. The chemistry between the two was slow to warm up but that goes along with the film's plot and then the sparks do begin to fly. Also, the many supporting character actors weren't too over the top which was a welcome change.There was little about Forces of Nature that I was unhappy with. It was a bit heavy for a romantic comedy but every love story doesn't need to end like Pretty Woman. Nature's message seems to be that sometimes all you can do for someone is wish them the best.

In the attempt, each must separately and together brave the more obvious external forces of nature (rain, fire, windstorms and hurricanes) as well as the internal forces of human nature (lust, greed, envy, fear etc.).  The irony is that sometimes, the forces that attract two people are the very same ones that eventually repel them.

While the occasional finely-tuned screwball comedy puts across real emotional development (think 'The Philadelphia story), most of them hare off into fast-talking craziness (think 'His girl Friday' or 'The Big Lebowski'), and quite rightly too. True romantic comedies, like 'Moonlighting', are usually gentler creatures and even more firmly based in fantasy.  That's why we watch them.This movie's basic problem is that it wants to discuss real issues - marriage - in the context of a romantic setup.  The ending isn't a surprise, it's a cheat.  Affleck & Bullock work well together and even manage a small amount of zap, not a given in movies like this, and a movie about their accidental meeting etc would be fine.  So would a movie about someone struggling to cope with the demands of adulthood and marriage.  But this particular blend of the two goes gooey and sticky when it should be tough. The relationships are never quite believable, especially that of Ben and his fiancee, who's clearly been watching too much 'Friends' (did she remind anyone else of Rachel?)

Best of all is a scene close to the end where two people are surrounded by a hurricane yet are completely unaware of it, lost in their conversation whilst the wind twists and howls around them.

Sandra Bullock protrays Sarah with stunning enthusiasm, and you cannot help but fall in love with her character. Ben Affleck plays Ben, a scared blurb writer  who doesn't really understand what life is all about before he meets Sarah. In a crazy, and not unlikely couple of days, both characters are forced to admit to themselves and each other their inadequacies and failing in life, and both see a way through to write the wrongs they have lived with. The ending of the tale goes the better of the two possible ways, and shows that Hollywood does sometimes come up with a script which doesn't follow the norms, and gives you something to really think about on the drive home. Definitely one to see. I highly recommend this film.

And it really works, the script is excellent and Sandra Bullock works her usual engaging magic. What you don't know you're getting is one of the most beautiful examples of cinematography this year. Too often too little attention is paid to experimentation with the camera in films like this. People go just to see the story, what do they care for fancy angles and the like? I didn't expect to find myself catching my breath at the sheer magnificence of some of the scenes. Ben and Sandra run through a car lot as slow motion rain falls around them, and it might not sound like much but it's so awe inspiring. I had a quick check and what do you know the cinematographer, Elliot Davis, is also responsible for Out of Sight last year. Of course he is! This has the same empty, calm, soft feel as that film. It's all about slow movement through a wide space which leaves the hairs on the back of your neck standing up. Excellent on many levels, as a bit of standard fun and as a work of art. Rating out of five for people who like to see Sandra Bullock with lots of black eyeliner - 5, for everyone else - 3  "},{"Title":"Intelligent and fun","Date":"9 May 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Intelligent romantic comedies are different today. The selfish generations have these days shifted film way beyond the happily ever after plot lines our screen lovers often inhabited in previous generations.Now families and mortgages have given way to second or third marriages coupled enthusiastically with cynicism.The progressive destruction of the nuclear family has been well and truly reflected in popular entertainment.So could you expect Sandra Bullock (Speed, Time To Kill, The Net) and Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare In Love) to be romantic clean skins in Forces Of Nature?Well actually Ben (Affleck) is giving it a go. He's on his way from New York to be married in Savannah to Bridget (Maura Tierney). On the way he encounters a series of natural and unnatural forces which throw him together with the effervescent and much more worldly Sarah (Sandra Bullock).Will Ben throw over Bridget for Sarah and how funny will the process be? These after all are the questions we attend these films to answer.Well Forces Of Nature is very funny once or twice but it's real value is its knowing observations on the institution of marriage. Ben is repeatedly confronted by the failure of the unions he observes while he's on the road to his own marriage.The message isn't savage but it is persuasive. He meets an deliriously happy elderly couple who he then finds out are having an affair after years of misery with their previous partners. His parents squabble and Sarah is hardly an advertisement for happy unions.But Forces Of Nature isn't maudlin, it's often very humourous and it's lifted by the relationship between Ben and Sarah which I found charming and believable even as the Forces Of Nature affecting their relationship become increasingly bizarre. (There's even a hurricane!)It's been a long wait for a fetching film from Sandra Bullock. Speed was a huge success but her career has been largely a mess since then. But her Sarah is amusing and multifaceted, as is the more dour Ben from Ben Affleck.Forces Of Nature mixed the improbable with the likeable in an intelligent way and is well worth a visit. And for once it would seem that we have one up on American viewers of an American film.Apparently a great deal of license has been taken with one or two geographical locations in the film, a bit akin for Australians to setting a film in Melbourne and then transplanting the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Port Phillip Bay.This upset some Americans but we Aussies couldn't give a damn, could we.

If you want it to be a screwball comedy, you'll be very disappointed.  There are a couple of discernible themes, one of which is the idea of Nature herself using all her formidable powers to throw the two main characters together and prevent the young man from marrying the wrong woman, the one he's trying to reach through fire, flood, hail, wind, you name it.  Some of the effects are enchanting, to use an old-fashioned word.  In the end, as fun as it was to imagine an all-powerful benevolent Force at work, you realize it was all just random coincidence -- beautiful, scary, sometimes hilarious, but with no mind or purpose driving it. The other theme is the theme of marriage, in particular the problem of finding just the right person, which also involves chance and luck. Take it, run with it, says the movie.

But it's not. It's only got half an idea of what it wants to do and spins its wheels for the rest of the film.Sandra is as appealing as ever, but her schtick has such an air of desperation to it this time that it kind of sours the film. You can tell she doesn't want to do this kind of thing anymore. Anyone who saw her in Practical Magic can tell that she'd like to-- and should-- stretch into more challenging and mature parts. I like her a lot, and hope she finds something better to do. Ben is fine, but he actually gets less interesting as the film wears on. And the ending makes him come off as a self-absorbed, narcissistic cad.The problem with much of this film is that it doesn't have much of anything for the characters to DO. They just hang out for a lot of it, and their dialogue and chemistry needs to be a lot better in order to make that interesting.A lot of people have commented on the incredible special effects. Don't be fooled. There is ONE 15-second sequence involving slow digital hailstones, and it's too bad it was used here, because it could have been used quite magically in a better film. Other than that there are a few nice digital sunsets, and that's it. I myself was getting annoyed at all the OBVIOUSLY SUNNY DAYS that these supposedly horrific storms were happening on. Ugh. And guess what, guys, if you want a metaphor, figure out how to use one. The storms here have no thematic weight and simply provide a diversion from the other pointlessness.There is ONE good moment in this film. The kiss.

In addition to Sandra Bullock's radical departure from the hum-drum plain jane role, we are also treated to a movie that show how funny Ben Affleck can be when he has a decent script to work with.  Unlike his last venture into space in Armageddon, Affleck can actually be heard to utter more intelligent lines than I LOVE YOU HARRY! (weep, weep)  The most impressive aspect of the film is the cinematography and the way it makes use of something as simple as a hailstorm and turns it into something ten times as menacing and thousands of times more beautiful to watch.

Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock star as airline passengers brought together by the forces of nature while Ben Affleck's character Ben Holmes is on his way to his wedding. Maura Tierney portrays his fiancee and she brought life to a character that was in the background. This is the perfect set up for Forces Of Nature because it seems when Ben and Sarah Lewis make progress; the forces of nature somehow get in the way. Maybe it's a sign that Ben is with wrong lady or maybe it's a way to let Ben think about the future. As I was viewing this film, I thought to myself Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock must have had fun making this film because it seemed that every time they were on screen together they were enjoying each other's company. One disaster after another occurred but Ben and Sarah made the best out of the situation and did a pretty good job. There is a sad note that came out of this film; David Strickland who portrayed Steve, the ex-boyfriend of Ben's fiancee was found dead after he allegedly hung himself in a Las Vegas hotel room. It's a real shame that this happened because he gave a good performance especially when he sang; I was surprised that he had a great voice.

The ending is completely fake (a cop-out, really) and little attempt was made to deal with the significant questions raised in the lives of the characters. The only fresh concept in the film is the ten-minute-long advertisement for Kmart in the middle of the picture.

Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck charm in this romantic comedy that is topped off with a totally unexpected twist ending, despite its secondary failings. Affleck plays Ben, a soon to be wed bachelor heading from New York to Savannah for his wedding. The plot completely revolves around this trip, which turns out to be one disaster after another for Ben. Upon boarding his flight to Savannah, Ben meets Sarah (played by Bullock), a free-spirited type who ultimately tries to bring out the inhibitions in Ben.  But before the plane ever gets airborne, it is befelled by a stray bird which causes the plane to skid out of control and wreck. With airborne transportation no longer an option, they hitch a ride with a stranger who, unbeknownst to them, is hauling a trunkful of marijuana. After a night in jail, Ben and Sarah hop on a train, only to somehow wind up in Chicago. From there, they coerce a ride with an elderly group traveling to Savannah to look at condos.Intertwined with all of these mishaps is Ben's growing apprehension towards marriage and his eventual lust for Sarah.  Regrettably,  the severely lacking subplot is also stuffed into this, in which Ben's fiancee is wooed by an old flame. His rendition of Phil Collin's Against All Odds will tempt you to leave the theater screaming for the pain in your ears. Meanwhile, Ben and Sarah eventually fall on hard luck again in their quest for Savannah, causing Ben to have to strip in a gay bar for money. This is hands down the funniest scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it's cut a bit short, as you never see Ben go full monty, which would have brought down the house. Ultimately, they get to Savannah just as a hurricane does. This was a very comical movie, with a somewhat predictable twists until that last curve, which you'll either love or hate. If you liked Planes, Trains and Automobiles, this is very similar, but with the added spice of romance, and Sandra Bullock sans Steve Martin, which I don't think anyone will argue with. The humorous strip tease, a totally unique rain scene and the surprise ending overcome the drab subplot to make this an entertaining watch. This one is a strong 3 out of 5 stars.

I don't think I have ever seen rain filmed more exquisitely. There were a few scenes where the rain (or hail) is shown falling in slow motion, so you could see the specific form of each drop. It is beautiful! Normally rain in film is used as a motif to create a feeling of darkness. I'll use the example of Seven which a film that uses rain to make it more dark and gloomy. Forces of Nature does not do this. The rain suggests happiness and freedom and even brightness, if you will. The film seems to be saying that people should do what they feel is right in their heart. The rain seems to reinforce this in that it symbolizes a certain freedom. Rain is a force of nature which occurs quite freely. From here the film falls apart.Forces of Nature seems to contain a certain duality in that one can see it both as a good and bad film at the same time. I'll try and explain this. The film is about a man, Ben and a woman, Bridget who are planning to be married in Savanah. Ben is on his way to Savanah, but the plane in which he is on, crashes before takeoff so he ends up on a journey cross country with Sarah who he meets on the plane. Along the way, Ben encounters many people who tell him of the horrors of marriage. This in combination with his growing fondness of Sarah on the trip, who encourages him to lighten up and experience some thrills in life, makes him begin to question his getting married. Is it the right thing to do? Is his heart really in it? I had the feeling that it wasn't. The movie plays along with this idea that one should follow their heart, but then seems to cheat us at the end. At one point Ben asks his parents on the phone if they are happy with their marriage. They don't really answer him honestly, but later on they say that they only way to know if you're making the right decision (to get married) is by giving it a shot. In a way this seems to contradict the rest of the film, but also in a way it doesn't because perhaps the moral of the story that you should follow your heart, but eventually you have to make a decision, which may mean suppressing your free spirited will, or else you'll never know what you are turning away. I'm not sure if this is the intention the film has, or not. It really isn't clear.

While I know I might be alone on this, I couldn't help but be completely in love with this film and the delightful way the story unfolds.  For the last 8 years, I have resisted Sandra Bullock.  I could not stand her constantly annoying performances in such dreadful films like `While You Were Sleeping' and `Time To Kill'.  Then, last May, Bullock starred in `Hope Floats'.  It was in that film that I could see Bullock had a real talent, and she could act pretty well when she actually had to.While in `Forces' the old goofball Sandra shows up, she really won me over with a sharply emotional, and yet very funny performance. Her and proven comedic talent Ben Affleck make a very smart team.  They both share a grand sardonic sense of humor, and can easily bounce off each other without ever breaking the rhythm of a scene. I will state unequivocally right now that if you find either Bullock or Affleck too smarmy or unpleasant, stay away from this film.Director Bronwen Hughes impressed me 3 years ago with her upbeat and lovely `Harriet The Spy'. Ms. Hughes has a real visual gift, and she chooses some wonderful shots here, some maybe even a bit poetic.  I look forward to her next movie. The film is shot beautifully, and the director wisely chooses long lingering shots of supporting actress Maura Tierney's face, a face that is vastly entertaining.I will admit that this story of two strangers who fall in love isn't the most original thing ever, but the material works this time. It will always work when the strength of the talent is this strong. I recommend this film highly, and I defy anyone to predict the ending. What a shocker. ---------- 9  "},{"Title":"You've seen one like this, you've seen them all ...","Date":"19 March 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and acting is not. I actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before I was so bored with it I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. The premise of Guess what happened to me on the way to the .... has been done over and over to death. Somehow there just doesn't seem to be anything funny, or romantic about people cheating on each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children especially impressionable ones that may view Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where the writers/producers/directors thought it would be nice to show how acceptable it is to smoke a joint .... while driving .... and then have no consequences at all when caught. I'm no prude, and I smoked my share when I was younger but I guarantee you I won't take my teenagers to see it and they're solid A & B students.

The average guy, a remarkable woman, and a seemingly unhealthy dosage of Fate thrown in the mix--the result is an unparalleled level of reaching the audience and leaving them with absolutely no doubt on what the film is about essentially, the trials of love, the sacrifices each of us make in the pursuit of that same passion, what is lost along the way, what is relearned in every relationship that follows. Set within the context of one's inevitable doubt before professing the sacred wedding vows, this film traces the development and, more important, the discovery of the hopes and aspirations each of us holds in our heart for a life-long love in marriage. Dazzlingly appropriate special effects enforcing the role of Mother Nature and a variety of camera shots not seen since something out of the Truman show make this film part of every film aficionado's little black book.  If you're looking for a film that will amaze you, make you clutch your chest in pain from laughter and surprise you to no end, this is it.  Modern romance has never possessed such conviction of human virtue more, and its ability to convey meaning is presently unmatched. It's a turbulent ride, but when you brave the storm, you're allowed the freedom to exhale . . . and then all the pieces fall together, one realizes that the storm serves to temper unbridled human devotion through love.

The writing is witty and in some cases pretty sharp. Sandra Bullock should see her star regain some of its luster and Ben Affleck proves to be deft at this sort of thing.

But I was really annoyed with this movie. that said, Sandra Bullock was as always splendid. But ultimately, wasted.I give this 4 stars solely for Bullock's fine acting as always. She's always worth watching, but pity about the script and the lead male actor.Well I don't have to like the sickeningly annoying ending just because some think it's brave etc. Of course it depends what you like and when I read an ending is brave I immediately suspect that means I won't like it at all. And I didn't. On the other hand...... someone else may feel it was the right ending. After all the guy was supposed to be getting married, and after behaving like a jerk, he finally does.Once you see the ending, you realise what an annoying twerp the hero Affleck plays actually is. My extreme disappointment turned to Serves the pair of them right, him and his wife-to-be right, she'll regret that marriage. Fortunately I didn't much like the fianc√©e and I didn't think much of the hero either. He definitely led Bullock's character on, he was weak, and you can see this recurring later in his life with other women, especially if they are predatory which Bullock's character is not. She was far better without him so in that respect the ending is the right one, but the way it's achieved, and Bullock's resigned acceptance, these are so annoying.I imagine the point of the story was that the hero would waver but end up still true to his girl. This could have worked if he and his girl had been interesting and moving characters and Bullock had lost patience with him and told him to do the right thing and go back to her. But no, Bullock's character had to be humiliated.So I felt very let down because Bullock was led on by this guy and then he changed his mind and dumped her and she grieves over this jerk. One can imagine him doing the same to his wife in some later year and assuring himself it's not his fault.... I see a weak-minded serial adulterer there. Which is partly due to the actor's portrayal of the character, of course. It could have been so different if the actor had been better at his job.So as in some others of Bullock's movies, the leading male actor is a disappointment and the story isn't as good as it could have been. This could still have ended as it did without leaving a very sour taste in the mouth or having to call the ending brave to perhaps avoid having to say urk. "},{"Title":"Tepid rom-com","Date":"7 March 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Take two Hollywood performers at their peak, place them in a romantic comedy loosely inspired by the riotous Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and watch the fireworks FAIL to ignite. Ben Affleck is a rigid businessman who finds his efforts to make it home to Savannah in time for his nuptials with Maura Tierney constantly confounded by the weather, mechanical failures, coincidence and the temptations provided by wacky free spirit Sandra Bullock, who keeps getting thrown together with him.Singularly Bullock and Affleck can be very entertaining, but together they do not have much spark between them. They come off more as a brother/sister pairing than potential romantics. Part of the problem is certainly the writing. Affleck's character is written as such a stick and Bullock is stuck playing such an offbeat stock character that the audience is never allowed to warm up to them. The less said about Tierney as Affleck's colorless fianc√©e, the better. Their misadventures grow tedious fairly quickly and events are not helped by Bronwen Hughes' uneven direction. Hughes either concludes scenes before they have built up a head of steam or allows them to drag on forever. For instance, the events at the hotel where Affleck and Bullock really start to bond and then run into acquaintances of his runs on and on and on. Meanwhile, a potentially hilarious sequence where, to earn money, Affleck reluctantly has to do a strip tease at a gay bar abruptly concludes right when it was starting to hit its comic high point. And these are only two examples. Hughes does not seem to understand what works and what does not. As such, we get a romance that is not particularly romantic, and a comedy with some scattered laughs that dry up long before the film has reached the two-thirds mark. I would venture to say there is not a smile to be had anywhere in the final third of this film.Another issue that fails is the ending. It probably sounds very mature on paper and it is certainly a non-Hollywood climax, but it is incredibly dull and renders the majority of the preceding scenes pointless. In a romantic comedy, one should never introduce a female character that is more colorful and appealing than the woman with whom the leading man ends up with (and vice versa). That is exactly what the writers have done here. They manipulate two characters together for romance and then in the final moments of the film, they have Affleck do an abrupt about-face and declare his undying love for Tierney, while a wise-beyond-her-years Bullock slinks off alone into the sunset. Affleck needs to sell us wholesale that the sight of Tierney alone has made him fall back in love with her (after a scant moment before he was planning on breaking off their engagement) and it is beyond both the actor and the screenplay to convince the audience of this. Rather than making it seem like Affleck is a great guy, it makes him seem more than a tad fickle. The next time he is stuck away from his beloved Tierney for a day or so, is he going to have another crisis of love? Does Tierney need to be in his line of sight in order for him to maintain the love affair with her? The entire scenario is just plain foolish. Affleck and Bullock have been much better elsewhere, and fans would be advised to find those other efforts.

After an incident on his plane, he hitch a rental car ride, along with eccentric, attractive Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock). As they continue the journey, it is slowly becoming obvious that they may have a thing for each other, and Ben is wondering if everything he has been through are signs that he shouldn't get married at all. In the end, he does eventually make it to the wedding, and after one or two delays and glitches in the event, he and Bridget do marry, and Ben just remembers Sarah as an influence or something to him, and hopes she is happy in her own life, which I guess she was, she has a son. Also starring Steve Zahn as Alan, Meet the Parents' Blythe Danner as Virginia, Total Recall's Ronny Cox as Hadley, Michael Fairman as Richard Holmes, Janet Carroll as Barbara Holmes and Volcano's Richard Schiff as Joe.

You know he will have to make that choice the minute Sandra Bullock appears on screen so I am not giving anything away. The mess that brings Affleck to the choice is the movie. Bridget and Sarah are both lovely characters, as we learn during the first half of the movie. Because we know the choice must be made in the end we also know that one of the lovely ladies gets hurt. As the watchers we do not want that so we like the movie less than we could have liked it. My Best Friend's Wedding with Julia Roberts had the same kind of choice but that movie had a good answer in the end. The difference was that in My Best Friend's Wedding the second woman was the best friend of the groom, not some total stranger like Sandra Bullock is here in the start.Sandra Bullock is very funny as Sarah, a woman who does whatever she wants. We learn that her life is not all joy and fun. Steve Zahn plays the best man of Affleck and has some funny scenes. Ben Affleck is okay, not great and Maura Tierney is very lovely.

This is a big surprise in regard of the big top Hollywood cast involved Bullock & Affleck...As always, a review is subjective and what I don't like may be the greatest thing on earth for anybody else, but I stay honest in my arguments and this is why I won't recommend this movie.1. I was born with the Technicolor time so I can't stand filtered colors in movie. You don't see reality any more, but an ersatz of it. Here, for the cold, steel airport of New York, you got blue; for the sweaty night, you got green, for the hot sunny day, yellow... Maybe the cinematographer is a beginner, because it's too evident here, or my TV is broken...2. Sure I am not tolerant enough, but stories against my core values are a pain for me Here, you got 120 minutes of anti-marriage stuff -it's a waste of time because you will divorce -you can't love only one person, you can't measure your love to check if it is the real one,..... My belief is that the wedding is the most beautiful act to prove your love... I can't relate with Affleck, because he ponders about the wedding, while in the same situation, I won't face any doubts if i marry, my love is strong and I am closed to temptations...But, the story offers 2 minutes of real pleasure at the end Affleck's father gives a tremendous speech about the value of wedding, that leaves his son & the audience without any doubts Wedding is a leap of faith it's a evidence that the honeymooners love each other, and their faith in this love which gives them straight to alienate a bit of their liberty... Nobody can say now it will work, but every one hopes & does what must be done ! Waiting all this time to find a excellent scene is a bit deceiving.So thanks me for giving you the best of it in two minutes & choose another movie !

They spend the rest of the movie together, inexplicably, and because the screenplay tells us, we find out they like each other.

Although advancing through this story is sometimes amiable fun, the ending results are forgettable and pointless. 	The movie's entire story is a series of uncanny coincidences ranging from heart attacks and drug busts to robbery and fires. Book-jacket blurbologist Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck), is becoming married to his fianc√©e, Bridget (Maura Tierney), in two days. At his bachelor party in New York, a stripper excites his grandfather into cardiac arrest. Ben stays with his relative a little while then catches a flight back to Georgia where Bridget is waiting.	Ben meets a young woman making out with her romantic interest at the airport. This woman, the pretty Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock), later ends up sitting next to him on the plane. Ben is a very nervous flyer, and when his flight crashes before it leaves the ground he becomes even more profoundly afraid of flying. 	He and Sarah buddy-up with a man at the port hitching a ride to his wedding destination. This man turns out to be a criminal, however, and is busted with the unlikely pair in the car with him. Many more events occur keeping Ben away from his wedding location. Such circumstances include a train wreck, a striptease, and mistaken identity. His parents (Michael Fairman and Janet Carroll), are not happy with his findings or state of affairs. 	The film's conflict is getting Ben from New York to Savannah, Ga. to wed with his fianc√©e. No recent structure complicates its initial problem as clearly as Forces of Nature, imaginatively written by  Marc Lawrence. The gradual increase of passion between Ben and Sarah makes for rich romantic chemistry, although there is none developed between Bridget and Ben. Forces of Nature concentrates on creating chemistry with Sarah and Ben, but never with Bridget. I did not know what to believe. Is Ben in love with Sarah in which he has known for only a few days, or is his heart with his eagerly waiting to wed fianc√©e?	Lame conversations featuring Ben and Bridget on a bed videotaping themselves enhances what little character development present. Such lame dialogue present includes I'm scared and It's the rest of our lives.  Why doesn't the movie show us how the two characters feel about marriage instead of explaining it?	Forces of Nature contains an interesting style, consisting of neat camera effects, scenes cut short, believable cinematography and jaunty soundtrack numbers. Some of the film's style is over the top, however. There is a magical hailstorm sequence that plays like a music video on MTV. And most of the film's laughs come from witty one liners, not the many incidences of stylish film making.	 Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock are the right choices for Ben and Sarah. They bring forth effective performances thanks in part to stylish directing and cleverly written dialogue. Most of the final segments of the second act are spent on Ben making a decision between spending his life with Bridget or Sarah. Though the entire second act  is wasted anyway in the manner this movie concludes itself. 	Forces of Nature is a movie too silly for serious romantics and overly thought-provoking for audiences looking for a good laugh. Teenagers may identify with the film's glossy look. But for most viewers, this is just a music video with plot.

Even after the first forty minutes of the film, when Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock haven't really drummed up anything remarkable, the film still heavily emphasizes both characters' qualities and their prime differences rather than ground them into reality like the film should. We still must be reminded that Sandra Bullock is different and free-spirited and Ben Affleck is straight-laced and getting married, but we don't get any more involved in these characters' personalities or their particular relationship other than it (a) is predicated off of the tired opposites attract philosophy and (b) that it really shouldn't be happening.Because of this, Ben Affleck's Ben Holmes and Sandra Bullock's Sarah Lewis feel like bland caricatures and not identifiable people. This is an issue when you have two characters that accentuate simple personality traits and those simple traits are the only methods of which we can define these characters. One is different, the other is a straight-shooter; these are very basic terms to describe people we've just spent one-hundred and six minutes with.Regarding the plot - as if I really need to - Ben is getting married and is on a flight home to Savannah, Georgia to attend the wedding. His plane suffers a crash before taking off and now, with his fear of flying even larger than it once was, must find another way back to Savannah. He meets Sarah, who must arrive to Savannah as soon as she can as well. Ben and Sarah decide to take an alternate method home together, which only results in more cockamamie circumstances happening to them over time. Ben, of course, being the cleaned-up fellow he is, hates when things detour from his original plan or intention, but Sarah, in the meantime, doesn't fret over small things. She loves flying by the seat of her pants, which may explain the problems she faces now with a custody battle.Affleck and Bullock, at this current point in time, didn't really need to establish their credibility in films. Affleck had already done both Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting, two phenomenal films, with Sandra Bullock appearing in Speed, a fine example of a truly tense and exciting thriller. Both actors had experienced carrying their own portions in a film in some way, shape, or form, and on that note, you'd think that Affleck and Bullock would be able to concoct believable chemistry with one another. However, Marc Lawrence's writing doesn't leave much to be desired in terms of development in their chemistry.If there's a light in Forces of Nature's smothering sameness, it's the atypical direction Bronwen Hughes takes for conducting the romantic comedy. Hughes seems to have an appreciation for visuals, nature (maybe hinted in the titled?), and natural lighting, making Forces of Nature a surprising experience for the eyes. I recommend watching some portions of it on mute so you can appreciate the beautiful lighting and cinematography (done very nicely by Elliot Davis and David Stockton) and not the goofy dialog that Affleck and Bullock engage in.Starring Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock. Directed by Bronwen Hughes.

It is the week before the wedding and poor Benjamin, who hates to fly, has to board a plane to Savannah. A book jacket writer, this handsome man tries to stay calm. However, the plane has problems and makes an emergency landing. Also on the aircraft, two seats away, was Sarah (Sandra Bullock), a free-spirit if there ever was one. As Ben doesn't want to fly and Sarah kind of takes a shine to him, they decide to hitch a ride with another man in a rental car. However, again, there are problems, as the man has pot in the auto and the three are hauled off to jail. And, so it goes. There is one mishap after another, with Ben calling Bridget at intervals to assure her that he is almost there. Her family is fuming, for they didn't like his Yankee heritage anyway. In fact, Bridget's father has invited a former flame to attend the pre-nupts and make moves on this engaged woman. As Bridget feels a slight pull in her ex's direction and Ben becomes more enamored with the unusual Sarah, will there end up being a wedding at all? This film is a fairly good romcom but not outstanding. Yes, its my nature, along with the rest of the world, to love Affleck and Bullock and they do their best, making the flick better than the script. Tierney, Steve Zahn, and all of the other supporting cast members are great, too. Also, the changing scenery from the various stops on Ben and Sarah's journey is nice, too while costumes are flattering. The nearly last scene, with an outside wedding being disturbed by strong winds, is quite wonderful. Therefore, its the tepid script and average direction that are to fault. Its another case of planes, trains, and automobiles mixed with mismatched mates, making viewers get a bit of deja vu all over again. So, dear romcom fans, you will probably enjoy this one but may feel desolate at the end, which, in my opinion, is not what is wanted or expected.

Unfortunately, even her masterful work can't bring Affleck out of his coma. He reminded me of what Adam Sandler would look like if someone had the monumental misjudgement to cast the latter in a dramatic lead.The movie, while artistically executed, is glacially paced, and there is no physical chemistry between the stars.

The idea of an out-of-control wild woman and a straight-laced businessman (okay, jacket copywriter) getting together was a fun idea. But, sorry, that's about as far as the fun went.I felt every single emotion in this film was manipulated, either through heavy-handed music (the scene where Ben as Ben turns on the radio in the cheap hotel room and hears, but of course, Love the One You're With) or pound-over-the-head foreshadowing (Ben's fianc√©e's old boyfriend). We are asked to believe that Sandra and Ben are going to stand on top of a train and shout into the open wilderness, and then, when the train locks itself to the next section, that they don't go flying off into the river below to certain deaths.We are asked to believe that, when desperate for money, they just happen to walk into the one gay bar in the sleaziest part of town and that, of course, Ben will be forced to strip for money to buy a cheap car to take them back to their destination.We are asked to believe many things that are far too coincidental. So, most of the movie doesn't work.But the main problem is In the beginning of the movie when Ben and Sarah (Sandra) are on the plane which runs into trouble before it even takes off due to some retarded seagulls, everyone is roughed up a little and Ben accidentally smashes Sarah's head with his notebook computer. Later, after everyone has been safely evacuated, Ben is hauling Sarah over his arm, getting her to a doctor or stretcher, or whatever the hell he thought he was going to do.Then, when he calls his fianc√©e to let her know he is okay, Sarah rushes the phone booth (but three minutes before she had been on a stretcher) and tells him, You saved my life! and kisses him madly. I'm sorry, what did he do to save her life? Nothing. So, the inciting event of the movie fails.Also, the endless jokes about marriage being a prison, and loving one person is like wearing the same clothes for the next 25 years... they wear thin quickly.Yes, Sandra is funny. She is glittering and gorgeous and has a movie star face and knows how to deliver a punch line (and a good swift kick if needed); yes, Ben is cute and adorable and he always looks like everything that comes down the line is a surprise and that he'd rather be in an episode of Leave it to Beaver, but, oh well, he is thinking, This is life and I guess I better learn how to catch the curveballs!... but, that aside, who cares? The ending was absolutely unacceptable; I didn't buy his speech to his fianc√©e for one second, nor did I think all the endless babbling about meeting someone and loving someone at the end was necessary. I can't believe the test audiences did not all at once storm out of the theater when the big surprise is revealed at the end. I was extremely disappointed. Another thing that was truly upsetting was, couldn't they think of ANY other name for Ben Affleck's character except Ben? How pathetic. Yes, it was a clever idea to combine force of nature with natural disaster and with Sandy Bullock's big, fabulous personality and gorgeous glamor girl looks. But ultimately, this movie fails on almost every level. I'm really sorry to say so because I'm a big Sandy fan, and am beginning to appreciate Ben as well.

But this has such great casting otherwise and tremendous special effects, plus a script that is a lot more thoughtful than you'd expect in a movie like this.The premise is that Ben, a nervous air passenger at best, decides against flying when the plane he and Sandra are on has a run-in with a flock of birds and almost crashes before leaving the ground.  So that leaves him trying to get to Georgia in time for his wedding.Along the way they have many adventures which, granted, push the grounds of credibility.  But a big chunk of the movie deals with what would best be termed magical reality.  There's a hailstorm which provides for as magical a scene as I can remember in recent movies.  And he gets to Georgia at about the same time a hurricane does, and he and his intended bride and their families try to sort things out while the wind is tossing about umbrellas and table decorations.  The logical thing for these characters to do would have been to go inside to talk, but the special effects are so good that we don't realize that conversations in that chaos would be futile until long after the movie has ended.And FORCES OF NATURE presents further argument that there should be a category of Best Casting at the Academy Awards.  The casting in this movie, down to extras who have no dialog but contribute a valuable presence, is superb.  It is cast with people who look as if they belong in these places and have lives that would make good movies in and of themselves.  Along the way the confused groom-to-be questions couples he meets in his travels, and those encounters are excellent.  Best yet, the casting director isn't afraid to show us people of 'senior citizen' status who are still vital and living their lives at full tilt.  Given Hollywood's usual worship of youth and terror at showing people past the age of thirty on screen at all, this in and of itself is almost miraculous.Check out FORCES OF NATURE.  In fact, we may go see it again next weekend. It's so good that repeated viewings will probably be even more enjoyable.The PG-13 rating is for drug use (which could have been cut out with little loss) and one scene involving strong language, and in that scene the character uses the words that even the most genteel of people would have used under those circumstances.This story has some nice 'life lessons' in it, so take the kids, too.On a five scale, Pops gives FORCES OF NATURE 4 spinning umbrellas.

If you ever did like either of these two, Forces of Nature will dissuade you from anything of the sort.  Don't see it, and...um....ya, right, don't see it ever.  Unless you fancy poorly written scripts and horrendous directing on such unoriginal subject matter, you will absolutely loathe this typically '90s hollywood production.

I really didn't care one bit about these characters, and didn't find much that was believable or funny.Every convenient and insipid plot development was easily predicted by my dog Simon.  I thought he was begging for food, but he was actually begging for me to turn the vcr off.Two paws down.

Really, far away.To say nothing of the K-mart capitalist bliss porn scenes where hanging out at K-mart is stated to be something approximating cool.The acting is flat. The characters don't breathe (well maybe the cardboard version of air), the actors look like they're recovering from root canals. Sandra Bullock is neither cute nor sultry, she's the Platonic ideal of average and pretty. It's just a horrid, horrid film. Both of these have done much, much better in other movies and should definitely have had their agents pull the bail clause. "}]
