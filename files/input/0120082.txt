It was a phenomenal achievement in the horror genre so of coarse a sequel was just around the corner. The most common rule with movies is that sequels are terrible and while that is normally always true, that isn't the case with SCREAM 2. It should be noted that SCREAM 2 came out just a year after the original SCREAM. Most often when sequels come out a year after their predecessor, they turn out to be pretty bad (CHILD'S PLAY 3 for example). SCREAM 2, while not as good as SCREAM, manages to be an effective and well made sequel that surprisingly is just as clever as the first one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well. It helps that SCREAM 2 has most of the same cast members as the first one too. I think it's safe to say that SCREAM 2 was one of the better sequels of the 1990s. I'm giving it 7/10. Recommended for fans of horror.

While most slasher sequels tend to be a let down and not live up to their first by having a ridiculous premise or not having the needed characters, Scream 2 is entirely different. This sequel was excellent, and lived up to the first Scream perfectly, when I did not think it would on first viewing. I mean, I was expecting it to be good, but not as good as it was. It's premise was wonderful, and the characters are amazing, because it has all the characters, that aren't already victims, from the first and more that are just as fun. All in all, it was a joyous outcome.Scream 2 is not afraid to kill off whoever it wants to, like the one before and after it, even though that one does not have as many fans as the first two. It has some new twists, and the execution style is just as professional and cunning as the first. It keeps you totally entertained and the performances are just as fun. While of course it is not as good as the original, it is pretty close, I must say, and that of course is an accomplishment in itself. After the events of Woodsboro, California, Sidney and Randy soon realize that a killer is on the loose again, this time at the college they are attending in Ohio. Dewey arrives on the campus to once again protect Sidney, and she and Dewey have an unwelcome reunion with Gale. How pleasant, we have all our old friends back, and the cast pulls out all the stops with their characters like they did in the first. It's still gritty and bloody, and it's also loaded with lots of nice material matter. I do not understand why it is not as appreciated as it is, regarding the rating mostly. Scream fans and horror lovers were all pleased with this movie when it came out, so I have heard, and I was as well.

The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream trilogy, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek.Sidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...The films opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in joke about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent and chief suspect Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.This is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.Scream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Pretty good sequel","Date":"13 December 2003","Score":"42 out of 62 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  The funny thing with 'Scream 2' is that it's not as entertaining and good as 'Scream' but with bad movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it's kind of a relieve. Probably the difference here is that Wes Craven is  a director who knows what he is doing.Neve Campbell as Sidney, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Jamie Kennedy as Randy return for this sequel. New possible subjects or suspects are Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Hallie (Elise Neal), Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), former suspect Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was in prison for a year, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) who is a big fan of Gale.The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right. It is one of the many funny little things. Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps are killed during the showing and of course the movie is blamed.From here it is like 'Scream'. The guessing can begin. Again it is a lot of fun, again the movie knows that it must not get too serious, again I was entertained by what I saw. 'Scream' was original and therefore better, more entertaining and more surprising in the way the subject was handled.

On one level Scream was filled with all the shocks and thrills expected of it. Yet there was another whole level to it which at the same time was consciously crafting a film that was slyly mocking and parodying its own genre and cliches. Characters stopped in the middle of the flight from the slasher to hold discussions about what characters in slasher films did in the situation and which type of character was supposed to survive according to the slasher movie formula. And following Scream's success, what more natural to follow it up with than a Scream 2, which gleefully launches into satirizing the pandemic of sequels that followed most slasher films in the mid-1980s.The plot follows on from the first; Sidney Prescott and fellow survivor Randy Meeks are attending a film and theatre school, while Gale Weathers is releasing a film based on the events of the first film (which hilariously parodies the first films opening) called Stab. However, at Stab's opening, two people are found dead, after being killed by a man in a Munch mask. Now Sidney is caught up in her very own sequel.The film has a fabulous opening that perfectly encapsulates the joyful sense of meta-fictional play that screenwriter Kevin Williamson delights in - while watching a film based on the events of the first film (wherein the opening of the first film is replayed but amusingly satirized - one scene rather funnily digs at directors that like to quote the Psycho (1960) shower sequence) a copycat killing takes place in the theatre where the victim's death throes are just taken to be part of the promotional gimmick for the film. Here the constant blurring of the lines between what is happening and `the artificial' is dazzling. And this naturally segues into a typically Williamson-esque debate on whether someone is trying to 'create' a sequel to the events of the first film, whether some sequels are better than their originals - you know it's a real genre fan writing when someone argues the merits of House II The Second Story (1987) over House (1986) - and whether the media influences violence.But unfortunately for Scream 2 the film that ends up on screen sadly fails to meet the criteria it itself establishes for worthwhile sequels. Williamson's script is far too burdened down and overweighed by the necessity of trying to turn the survivors from the first film and most of the cast members into potential suspects and as a result the jokey genre interplay that essentially made the first film gets lost. There is the odd moment - the script even parodies its own catchphrase from the first film `What's your favourite scary movie?' the stalker asks Jamie Kennedy. `Showgirls - now that was a truly scary movie.' And the ending wherein the slasher explains their motivation - that they want to be caught so they can demonstrate the case for movies influencing violence in real life - is positively ingenious. But such an ending is ruined by Williamson placing so many successive twist revelations on top of that that the moment topples over into the farcically absurd.Indeed, the film contains genuine tension; the vague reconstruction of Casey Becker's demise is very scary, and a scene where Sidney and her friend are trapped in a police car with an unconscious killer is exceptional.However, Scream 2 tries too hard to be clever and witty, instead of just getting on with it.Verdict - While Scream 2 is quite scary, and has some hugely inventive sequences, it gets too caught up with parody and clever-clever remarks. ***  "},{"Title":"Still fun, but less clever than the original","Date":"14 April 2007","Score":"15 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" How do you make a sequel to a horror film whose whole plot was made of in-jokes and film references? Easy make the follow-up even more in-jokey and self-referential than its predecessor. This formula actually seems to work for Scream 2, at least in the first two acts.The prologue is arguably a masterclass in self-irony an African-American couple (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett Smith) go to a movie theater where a new horror film, called Stab, is screening. This flick is based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book The Woodsboro Murders, which recounts the events of the first Scream. As the movie begins, Smith's character complains about Stab being a film with no black people in it (just like Scream was), and, predictably, this leads to the two African-Americans being brutally murdered as the film-within-a-film's prologue (with Heather Graham replacing Drew Barrymore) is shown on the screen, so that the fictional and real deaths occur almost simultaneously. From there on, things take the usual turn the media go crazy about the killings and once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in the spotlight, as she and her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must protect themselves from the new foe, who is apparently mimicking what happened in the past (an obvious reference to the first film's Movies don't create psychos line).The main charm of the original Scream was its ability to almost seamlessly combine clever in-jokes and a believable plot. This time around, the in-jokes are the best thing in the movie, while the story, particularly in the overblown conclusion, suffers from merely repeating key scenes from the first film. Now, this might be a satire on the lack of originality in most horror sequels, and it would work if the characters were developed correctly. Sadly, such a thing doesn't happen, with Sidney being reduced to the usual girl who keeps running and screaming (fitting, huh?) and everyone else (including Liev Schreiber, who gets more screen-time in the sequel) playing stereotypes, with the exception of David Arquette, very likable as the nice cop again trying to solve the case, and Kennedy, who has a great time stating the rules to follow in a sequel.Ironically, the movie's funniest scene has a bunch of film students discussing follow-ups that are better than the originals. And while few could have anything bad to say about Aliens, Terminator 2 or The Godfather Part II, it must be said that Scream 2, while fun and watchable, most certainly doesn't have the same sharpness that made its predecessor an above-average horror film.

As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of Friends cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama). This sequel has more blood, more deaths, and more jokes. Like the original, I too enjoyed this film for its entertainment value if nothing else.

To be honest this was one the sequels I was looking forward too and gladly it didn't disappoint me. It still managed to keep the intensity and humour the first one did, the first Scream was like a tribute to 80's slashers and was quite frankly much better than them all and Scream 2 is a tribute to the 80's college slashers and again better than all of them put together.The characters themselves really made the movie as well the ones who came back are the lovely level headed Sidney (Neve Campbell) back, my fave Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the horror movie film buff who sadly doesn't get enough screen time, Dewey (David Arguette) the lovable silly policeman and the bitchy but sexy Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who all come back but will they survive this time.

Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson take it to high gear this time around. It's a lot less subtle and more in your face, which is a nice change of pace compared to the first film, cause you cannot do what you did in the first movie. Like the first film, it's hilarious with the self-aware characters and the jokes that come with it, but it still takes the kills very seriously. Craven and Williamson keeps the guessing game going and it still makes us wonder who the damn killer is. The main players, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy are back. What makes this Scream special is that the cast is likable, perhaps in my own opinion a little more likable than the original. The last two don't have any characters that are as likable as first Scream and this sequel. All the cast are great. Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber, etc. They all come to play and bring their A-game. You also feel for most of the cast. The script has fun making Derek, played by Jerry O'Connell a potential suspect. The film show's Sidney's rightful paranoia, like the little moments where Derek offers her a seat and she sits next to Timothy Olyphant's character Mickey. You can't help but maybe feel a little sorry for him, but yet ponder if he is behind all the killings. Williamson does a great job juggling all these characters. What I respect about Scream 2 is that it doesn't play it safe at all. It takes risks and makes no apologies. They kill off, who is arguably the most popular character in the series Randy Meeks. It takes balls to do that, but I'm glad they did. I love Randy, but his death just made Scream 2 that much more unpredictable and immediately the stakes are much higher. They didn't play it safe. Props to Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. Some may ponder that Sidney and Randy were destined to be together, and probably should have died in the third film while they end up as a couple, but even if that may have been cool, killing him off in this sequel makes everything unpredictable and makes a bigger shocking impact. Speaking of impact, the killer reveals are quite a surprise. Mickey(Olyphant) was expected, but Craven and Williamson do a nice homage to Laurie Metcalf's Mrs. Loomis, Billy's mother. Breaking a rule of a serial killer typically being a male, as well as tributing other female killers in cinema, particularly Mrs. Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise.The first Scream is game changer, but in the second film, it solidified Sidney Prescott being poison. If you're friends with Sidney you die, like poor Randy Meeks. You would think all the main players are safe, but they're not, at one point you even think Dewey is toast. You just don't feel safe for anyone else, and what I love is that it spoofs itself, cause Randy's argument is that sequels, especially sequels to horror films are garbage, ironically making Scream 2 being one of the few horror sequels that is considered to be worthy compared many atrocious horror sequels that killed the genre. It's meta, even before people knew what meta was.9/10 "},{"Title":"Part 2 of more screams and slashing.","Date":"8 March 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" This is the sequel to one of the definite slasher movies, where two years after the events of Scream, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are trying to get on with their lives and are students at Windsor College.

Like Scream, this is just over the top self-regarding nonsense, with too much discussion of particular movies within another movie.Gale arranges a meeting between Cotton and Sidney, without telling Sidney. Even Cotton thought that was a bit much. Sidney hits Gale again, during filming. Dewey is displeased with Gale for her characterization of him in her book as Barney Fife. Ish.Sidney might pledge at Delta Lambda Zeta, so we have another mini-universe of clichés to exploit. Cici is at the Omega Beta Zeta house, and becomes the next victim in the cycle. Back at the mixer, Portia di Rossi's eyebrows were hideous. The attention quickly shifts from the mixer to Cici's death and the swarming of cops and reporters.The costumed assailant attacks Sidney in the DLZ house after the crowd has left. Derek gets stabbed, but far from fatally. The next morning, there is a lot of assessment and not enough facts. Dewey, the Sheriff, and Gale notice a pattern in the names of the new victims versus the principals in the earlier case.Sidney gets invited by Gus Gold to play Cassandra. The costumes in the play are more than a bit reminiscent of the murderer's Halloween get up. Also, they have knives, so this was not such a great idea.Randy gets killed in Gale's van while it's on the quad; Sidney gets a death threat in the library. Goodness. Cotton has a talk with Sidney in the school library; she wants to leave, he won't have it; he starts yelling like everything while still in the library. The cops take him in for an alternate discussion.Dewey and Gale pore over footage from recent crime scenes, looking for the culprit. That worked out fairly well for the killer. Dewey has a more than rough spot; the killer rushes off to go after Sidney and Hallie.The picture wraps up hard and fast after that.----Scores-----Cinematography 10/10 Good-looking picture.Sound 10/10 Fine, no problems.Acting 7/10 Not as good as the original. Liev Schreiber was an improvement over Matthew Lillard, but he did not make up for the presence of Pinkett-Smith or Jerry O'Connell.

One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered.

It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie cliché's and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.

And although Scream 2 is down a notch on that scale, it still hits the mark quite effectively and turns out as a fast, slick and brutal sequel that is high above your average slasher fare.Sydney(Neve Campbell, a little better acting here) is the likable, sweet heroine from the first story, in which her boyfriend and a friend were terrorizing high school students because of Sydney's dark past, which is dwelled upon in all three Scream films. She has moved on to a remote Ohio college, where she is now studying to be an actress. Paranoid and traumatized, Sydney is thrown back into the nightmare when scary murders begin plaguing the peaceful campus. One by one, her friends begin to get picked off by the angry killer in the ghost face suit that has made these movies a landmark in horror history. A bit clichéd and a bit less predictable, this Scream is still a worthy horror film and stands on its own, whereas most sequels fail miserably. David Arquette and Courteney Cox (from Friends and previous Scream fame) get thrown in the mix as well, reprising their hilarious roles and on screen romance as an ambitious cop and a bitchy reporter who survived but are stalked once more alongside Sydney. Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven conjure up another awesome scarefest and the deaths are relentless and creative up to the satisfying conclusion. As aforementioned, it's all not as tense or dark as the first. But it gets points for taking on a more serious tone and keeping the murderer well shadowed until the surprising unveiling. Good acting from the supporting cast and all around good editing make Scream 2 a hit. Great bloody and humorous fun. Unique and scary, 7 out of 10. "}{"Title":"Not Quite The Godfather Part 2, But...","Date":"7 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" 'Scream 2' is one of those films that seems to have suffered most from the backlash against the knowing, self-referential horror films of the late nineties. Not only is it the sequel to the film that started the whole movement ('Wes Craven's New Nightmare' notwithstanding), but it carries the postmodernist game-playing to a new level. Horror purists loathed it for being populist and 'ironic', critics hated slasher movies on principle, and the larger audience were suffering from in-joke fatigue by the time they saw it. So unfortunately, nobody notices that not only is it a better film than the one it succeeds, it's probably the best horror film of the period.The opening sequence is particularly striking. Everything that made the original's celebrated opening sequence so iconic is either subverted or built upon. So again, a young woman and her boyfriend are stalked and murdered, but this time it plays out in a crowded cinema (showing a tacky reinterpretation of the original, just to reinforce the connection). Where the horror used to be in isolation, it is now found in alienation - the nightmare of dying in front of hundreds of people and nobody lifting a finger to help you is particularly potent. The iconography of ghost-face is played upon here too, not only in the film-within-a-film but the masks members of the audience wear. Given that the film seems to be a refutation of the old 'violent movies cause violence' argument (Sarah Michelle Gellar's character acts as the voice of sanity, Timothy Olyphant's character parodies what Wes Craven clearly considers the voice of insanity), it's striking that in this opening sequence the audience is seen as partly culpable for the murder. The moment when a bleeding Jada Pinkett-Smith cries out on stage, framed by the projection of ghost-face's mask (and bleached out by the white light, an interesting visual cue back to the debate over black characters in horror films that opens the film), and the baying audience subside in uneasy realisation, is one of the most indelible images in a horror film I've ever seen, and a slap in the face for the (real) audience, who have come to the cinema in order to see people get sliced up, after all. It takes a brave movie to implicate its viewers before the film has really got going, and certainly underlines the fact that this is neither a dumb slasher flick or a cheap cash-in on the success of the original.The potency of the death of this character we have only spent a few minutes in the company of illustrates something else about 'Scream 2' (and 'Scream', for that matter) - that, despite the repeated use of the word by lazy magazine and newspaper critics who ought to know better, they are not 'ironic'. No wonder Kevin Williams turned the definition of the word into a running joke in his later script 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'; he must have been sick of the misallocation of the word in almost every review he read. It implies a style that contrasts the apparent and actual meaning of situations and dialogue. Irony in this sense undercuts what we are being shown and what the characters experience, usually turning it into bathos. There is no irony in the deaths of the characters in 'Scream 2', unlike 'Final Destination 2', for instance, where characters being sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence or crushed by a falling pane of glass are both moments of horror and moments of humour. In contrast, when Hallie buys it so soon after surviving the film's most excruciating suspense sequence, it's horrific because she's a likable, funny character who doesn't deserve to die. The audience responds to the characters on an emotional level, mainly because of Williams's unfairly uncelebrated skill at creating three-dimensional characters in just a handful of scenes (compare with 'Scream 3', scripted by Ehren Kruger, where only Parker Posey's self-obsessed film star stands out), but also because of the skills of an above average cast (particularly Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber - although frankly Laurie Metcalf calmly pockets the entire movie in a single scene. Compare also Neve Campbell's likable, determined Sidney with Jennifer Love Hewitt's Julie Jameson in the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' films - a drip written (initially by Williams, irritatingly) and acted with half the skill, who constantly needs rescuing by her boyfriend as though she were the heroine of a Victorian melodrama). These are not the corpses-in-waiting of most slasher films, but funny, rounded individuals with their own foibles who die senselessly and horribly. The humour (and it is a very, very funny movie) is not at the expense of the horror, or the characters enduring it. It's also worth noting the real skill with which Craven orchestrates the suspense, the excellent use of music (particularly some borrowed from the 'Broken Arrow' score), Tori Spelling's gameness (although she gives away the plot twist of 'Stab' in that interview!), and Portia di Rossi's remarkable eyebrows. This movie needs serious re-assessment. Personally, I think it's richer than your average horror-snob's favourite.

A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way.Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILERThe cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as evil as Billy did.Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original.Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.

He was the perfect man to make Scream, a post modern homage and comedy of slasher films but also a good slasher on its own. Writer Kevin Williamson originally wanted to make Scream a trilogy, so getting Wes Craven was a sensible decision to keep the series going.A year after the events of Scream a film has been about it, Stab. During a preview screening two university students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) are murdered in a crowded cinema. The media descend on the university which the hero from the first film, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is studying at. And it all seem like it was going well for Sidney who seem to get her life back on track. But the survivors of the first film become the targets of the new ghost face killer as the body court starts to raise.Like the first film there is sharp dialogue throughout, there is insight about horror genre and theories about whether violence in film influence violence in real life (I personally think that rubbish because if you got violence tendencies you don't need a film to influence you) and it both a commentary on the genre and social attitudes. Even if Scream and Scream 2 were made as straight forward slasher films they would seen be better then most because the character are more likable and believable then in most slashers, making you care for characters if something happens to them. I also really like Craven's way of shooting chases with the way the camera follows the action of someone being chased in a easy to follow yet tense way. Paul Greengrass should take note that a scene can be tense without the need of shaky cam preventing the audience working out what's happening.The acting is decent enough. Courtney Cox's character Gail Weathers grows to be a little more softer and likable with more tender scenes. Campbell is very solid as the lead, forced back into a situation she thought she would never face again. But after going through all this twice I would have thought she would be psychological scarred for life. Elise Neal and Pinkett basically play typical sassy black women, especially Pinkett who is also a woman with an axe to grind about women's and African American's rights. Jerry O'Connell who plays Sidney's boyfriend is made out to be a decent bloke if a bit of a preppy. I personally thought that Liev Schreiber was a bit of a weak link because I really did not buy into performance and his looked like he was on autopilot.Scream 2 is also filled with subplots, one of them being the three other survivors believing one of them is the killer and they go on the search to find out who it really is and one able Cotton (Schreiber) wanting to get Sidney to agree to an interview about how her evidence got him arrested for her mother's murder and so he could put his side of the story out to the media. There were well handled and did not distract from main plot which a fast paced affair. The scene on the university court yard was an additional tense when characters try and find Ghostface.The film starts off being very similar to the first film, a 10 minute prologue, the police and media going crazy, the debate of film and Sidney punching Gail, it is still different from the first and not just a repeat of Scream. For the most part Scream 2 still plays on horror clichés like two characters arguing a case about whether to run or check to see if the killer is dead and have a valid argument. But sometimes Scream 2 does fall into the cliché trap like a cop having a chance to kill Ghostface or the characters splitting up when Ghostface is around. But it still a strong, entertaining knowing horror film.

But Sidney is off to college now, and things are beginning to look up. She has a good best friend, Hallie (Elise Neal), and a love interest, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). But after a murder that occurred in a cinema (that was incidentally showing a movie based upon the murder spree that Sidney survived), the memories flood back, and another masked killer in the same attire begins to murder those around Sidney - but who is it behind the mask? A follow-up to Wes Craven's 1996 horror hit, Scream, this slasher sequel is a guaranteed good time. Kevin Williamson returns to write the script for this film as well, and crafts a fairly solid story to continue the series with. The opening of this movie (the cleverly-executed cinema murder) was fabulous, and is probably the most memorable thing about this movie. There is some tongue-in-cheek humor to be found as well, but nothing over the top - this film remains fairly serious despite it's poking at the horror genre rules, which is something the original did quite well. I have to give Mr. Craven and Mr. Williamson some credit for their clever handling of these films, because they really are well-done horror movies.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy return from the original, all giving good performances. Some new additions to the cast are Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sarah Michelle Gellar (who starred in I Know What You Did Last Summer the same year), to name a few. The acting is on-par for the most part, and I liked the casting. The atmosphere in this film is much different than the small-town feel the original had, which I personally preferred - then again, you can't have a movie like this take place in the same town for a second time. There are plenty of surprise moments as well (and some clichéd jump-scares), but the conclusion was probably the biggest surprise of all. I never saw it coming, and I don't think most people would because the writing was so well done. Overall, Scream 2 is a worthy sequel to a groundbreaking horror movie. Did I like it better than the first? No way, I prefer the original, but that doesn't mean it was bad at all. It was entertaining, spooky, and had enough twists and turns to keep nearly anyone's interest. Scream fans will be surely pleased with it.

Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney Prescott who is now in college, and is dating a handsome heartthrob named Derek (played by Jerry O'Connell). Jamie Kennedy also reprises his role as Randy Meeks, the film-geek who's remained friends with Sidney after the events from the first movie. This film follows a copycat killer that is on the loose and taking the lives of others on college campus. Sidney must team up with her boyfriend Derek, and Randy, along with Gale and Dewey who also make their return from the first film, to survive against the killer's onslaught.As this film is a sequel, there are quite a bit discussions between characters about sequels and what they are all about. Like this film, these characters are very self-aware of the strategies of surviving against a killer in a horror movie, and the script makes very clear. While this one may not level up the previous film, it still remains as original and thoughtful as the previous film came out to be. It still contains the scares, suspense, and bloodshed by the Ghostface killer, and the wittiness of writer Kevin Williamson's script. It also pays a good homage to classic low-budget slasher horror films from the 80s like Splatter University, Slaughter High, and and Graduation Day. Liev Schreiber makes an interesting appearance as Cotton Weary who was the accused suspect of Sidney's mom's murder in the last, and is released from prison after proved not guilty. Neve Campbell remains good as ever as Sidney, and the rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, and Elise Neal are great as well.

I dare say that not even the producers dreamed it would be as popular as it was. Yet it was. Therefore a sequel was almost guaranteed.The greatest thing about 'Scream' was how 'self aware' it was, constantly parodying its own genre. Therefore, the imaginatively-titled 'Scream 2' had a lot to live up to. Did it? The film itself answers the question. Knowing it's a sequel, one of the characters states that by definition a 'sequel is an inferior product.' I guess he has a case (although the other characters disagree with him!). 'Scream 2' may not be as original as the original (surprise, eh?), but it carries on nicely in the same vain.Neve Campbell (and the remaining survivors of the first encounter) all return (which is nice and not always common in horror sequels) for this outing where, once again, they're mercilessly stalked by a masked killer. Yes, the plot is pretty simple &#x96; as was the original and so many slasher flicks before it &#x96; but it works, again. The fact is that there's so many awful slasher/horror films infesting the bargain DVD buckets that this sequel almost seems like a masterpiece in its own right.Once again there are plenty of 'red herrings' in terms of characters who may or may not be the killer and I doubt anyone will really guess who's behind the mask until it's too late. Neve Campbell is great to root for as the heroine, but David Arquette does tend to steal the show in terms of sheer lovability! It's witty, it's gory and it's fun. If you liked the first, you should enjoy the second and if you like slasher/horror films in general, you should also get something out of this. Yes, like the character 'Randy' says, it may be an inferior product, but don't let that put you off. And don't think too deeply about plot points &#x96; but then if you're a fan of the genre you probably do that anyway when it comes to slasher flicks.

Along with Sidney are several characters returning from the previous film including her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy), police deputy Dewey (David Arquette), and ruthless news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox). Also appearing as either victims or suspects are Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), her friends Hallie (Elise Neal) and Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), and the man that Sidney wrongly convicted of murdering her mother, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber).While self-awareness is something I usually hate in movies because I think it makes them hypocritical, Scream 2 does it right. For one thing the movie doesn't use self-awareness to cover for itself because it's a sequel. Along with that, though, the movie has a few clever inclusions to it to make it look like a typical sequel. A lot of the time, sequels are just the original redone in a different way. With the inclusion of people watching scenes from Stab, the audience is literally re-watching the same movie as the first one. Another example is Gale's cameraman Joel (Duane Martin) knows that to survive he has to get away before anything happens. He leaves the film half-way through, only to return at the end, unharmed and thus surviving the movie. The only time the self-awareness comes off as hypocritical is when a sorority girl named Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) hears a noise and starts searching the house after she already had the bright idea to leave it.One thing the movie did was develop the characters more. In the first movie, Gale and Dewey are hinted at having some sort of interest in each other, but it's not anything important. In the second film, they expand on that idea to give them a deeper connection. The movie also displays the effects of the first film weighing heavily on Sidney, with minor things like slight differences in her characters actions and way of thinking to more extreme things with her not fully trusting Derek because of her boyfriend from the first movie's inclusion in the murder spree.This movie had a lot of scary and suspenseful moments, the best being when Sidney is rehearsing the play she's in and with all of the effects and extras dancing around on stage with fake weapons and creepy masks, she either sees or imagines the killer running around on stage trying to get her. This movie also carries on the use of elaborate red herrings that the first movie used, making you think it could be anyone. And while this movie does do that, the knowledge that this movie is a sequel makes you wonder whether or not they're going the same route or not.Scream 2 is a well thought out self-aware horror film with a lot of attention placed into the atmosphere of the movie. The movie is aware that it's a sequel and that sequels are usually inferior to the original, but the people behind the movie worked to make it better. They did more with the characters, they didn't hit rewind with the story, they let the events from the first film actually effect the story, and made a suspenseful, scary movie all at the same time.

Rotten Tomatoes (a website that's not a fan of sequels) gave this a (slightly) better rating than the first (Scream 78%, Scream 2 81%, it's not much but still.) This is a sequel that won't disappoint, it's still very clever, and a tad better than the original. The characters, new ones and survivors, are well acted and likable. The scares and chase scenes are very effective, and I'm sure you will find yourself at the edge of your seat in many scenes, and you're gonna jump a lot too. The script is pretty great also. The twist (and the rest of the film too) pack many surprises. So, if you haven't seen Scream 2, and are a fan of the first Scream, I recommend this movie to you. 8.8/10 (P.S. don't look at the IMDb page for Scream 3 if you haven't seen this one, it will (obviously) tell you who survives this movie) "},{"Title":"Don't Expect the First","Date":"3 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" Good things At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise.I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5? "},{"Title":"Scream 2 (1997)","Date":"24 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" 70/100. Apparently Scream didn't get the message from earlier slasher movies that the sequel is supposed to be bad to average. What I really like about Scream 2 is that it doesn't try and be all that different and they for all intensive purposes cop to that fact in the movie by referencing it consistently even playing reenacted scenes from the previous years film. As if that point wasn't already shoved down our throats we are constantly reminded by multiple characters that sequels always are inferior. Why such the high grade? Because not only is the story just as scary and funny, but its characterization may even be superior. By the end of the film Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is not the same person she was at all in first Scream, and you really feel for Sidney understanding her inner demons and reluctance of trust toward her college boyfriend after her fling with her psychopathic high school sweetheart. It was fun to see more than one character from a previous slasher film especially since I enjoyed all of the characters previously. One of the few teen slice and dice movies where you actually really pull for your favorite characters to come out alive. Liev Screiber is fantastic in an expanded role as the hard luck former lover of Mrs. Prescott looking to cash in on his misfortune of being wrongly accused for her death as detailed in the first Scream. Kevin Williamson writes his crass dialogue beautifully which really made me wonder why more characters haven't been fleshed out similarly before. I was a big fan of the opening which I felt was even better than the slightly over-the-top intro with Drew Barrymore. Although the final showdown was somewhat of a let down, scenes such as having to crawl past the killer to escape the pinned police car and Sarah Michelle Gellar's frightening encounter with Ghost face certainly gave off enough thrills. Admittedly not as good as the first, Scream 2 in my mind very well might be the best slasher sequel made to date. "},{"Title":"Can it Be...? A Sequel That Doesn't Suck?","Date":"26 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" That is exactly what it is. A sequel that doesn't suck. This continuation is actually as good as the origin of the quadrilogy (god I really hate that word, why not just call it a trilogy plus one). Anywho, you know what is next (sorry for sounding so self-important).Basic Story Guide Two years after the Woodsboro murders, everyone from the original movie (who survived) have gotten on with their lives. While two collage seniors are attending a movie preview of Stab, the movie adaptation of the Woodsboro Murders, not just the event itself but a book written by Gale Weathers, both are killed by someone wearing the infamous Ghostface mask. Sidney Prescott is attending Windsor Collage along side Randy Meeks when she receives the news of the two murders and is adamant that this is just the beginning, while Randy is skeptical. After the third victim is found murdered, Gale sees a pattern some of the names match up to victims of the first killing spree, and there is only conclusion, a copycat on campus and wanting to make a real sequel. Sidney is once again pitted against Ghostface, but by the end, not everyone who made it out of Woodsboro may not make it out of Windsor Collage alive.Verdict While this movie is not as good as the Scream, it is (as the title implies) a sequel that does not suck. A rarity in the horror genre. Those who were attracted to Screams style of bloody violence, the meta humor, and the mystery of who-done-it, will love Scream 2 as much as the first.

Two years later, Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is attending Windsor college with her friend, Randy Meeks (Kennedy). She has a new boyfriend, Derek (O'Connell) who is a pre-med student and new friends, Hallie (Neal) and Mickey (Olyphant). When 2 classmates, Maureen Evans (Pinkett) and her boyfriend, Phil Stevens (Epps) are murdered at a premiere screening of Stab, a film based on the Woodsboro murders, Sidney becomes targeted by a copycat killer trying to make a real-life sequel and everyone becomes a suspect. Cop, Dewey Riley (Arquette) shows up to protect Sidney and reporter, Gale Weathers (Cox) is trying to get a story by reuniting Sidney with falsely accused man, Cotton Weary (Schreiber) giving him a chance to give his side of the story. Metcalf plays reporter, Debbie Salt. This is a good sequel that probably should've been the last in the series I recommend. "},{"Title":"Good if Flawed","Date":"4 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" I had heard that this was an excellent sequel to the first Scream, and going in, I was expecting something good. And this delivered. It takes are the criticisms and satire of the first Scream to another level, questioning whether movies influence people's actions (in an ironic way), and railing on college life in general. It also brilliant in the way it references the first Scream, especially during the scene where Randy and Dewey are trying to find suspects, and they use sequel logic to narrow down the list. In other moments, the movie makes fun of itself in a similar way.This movie is extremely well written (Kevin Williamson), with many memorable lines that manage to develop plot and have a greater significance. There is also an almost surrealist element in two scenes When Jada Pinkett dies in the movie theater the mood goes from funny to incredibly disturbing in a two second twist and the scene where Neve Campbell is playing Cassandra in a rehearsal for her school play is probably the scariest in the movie, and I wish Wes Craven would have played up that image more.The one thing that truly held me back from loving this movie, however, was the end. I would have liked it fine if the Micky twist had stood, but the one that follows it is ridiculous, and even though it is explained, unbelievable within the context of the story.Overall though, it is a worthy sequel to an already excellent horror movie.-Alex B.

Before the movie started I did not have high expectations for Scream 2, which is probably why I loved this movie. Although it did not have the amazing opening scene or as original of a twist as the first one, Scream 2 still delivered. The same people that survived in the first film are back but this time Sid is at college. I ended up jumping more in this movie than I did in the original. This movie had some intense scenes, such as the car scene were the killer is knocked out and Sid and her roommate have to climb over him. Also, this movie had dramatic points that actually made me feel bad. I throughly enjoyed this movie considering most horror sequels are just ridiculous, but Scream 2 is quite the exception. This movie was a great sequel and I am excited to watch the rest of the series.

I might have given it only a 6/10 (which is also good), but there is one moment in here, that really shocked me. Something that I guess people who have seen the original (and I am assuming you have in my review), will not see coming (unless they have read about it or someone told them).We have the survivors back and we also have the winning team back from part 1. Craven and Williamson do a pretty good job to continue the story (while not being as sharp as in the first one). While the first one ended with a pretty great climax (so simple and yet so genius), this one cannot top that. But it doesn't have to top it (especially with the great moment happening prior to that), it just has to entertain us. And that it does ...

I did like the plot twist with Debbie Salt revealing herself to be Billy's mom. Once again, Neve Campbell does an excellent job portraying her role as Sidney Prescott and Jamie Kennedy as the movie geek yet comical, Randy Meeks. But, I was very disappointed about the fact that they killed off Randy was the biggest mistake. I thought the trilogy would have been much better if they let him live and get Sid and kill off either Gale or Dewey. Plus the dialogue was not too great and Mickey's motive was just plain stupid. Overall I'd give this a 6-6.5/10. "},{"Title":"Good Follow up","Date":"18 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" This film is a decent follow up to the 1996 original. The reason this one is even half as good as the first one is because of returning director Wes Craven, and the cast of course who all graciously returned. The most disappointing thing about this film was the death of Jamie Kennedy's character Randy Meeks who I loved. After seeing the first Scream my life was forever touched by the lovable rants of Randy. I live my life by his teachings and still to this day shed a tear when I think of his demise. He was more than just a character to me, he was like family. When I was sitting in the dark lonely theater back in December 1997 watching this I shrieked in terror as the blade went into Randy and ended the magic that was his character. I was ticked. The film has it's moments though. I love the evolution of Sydney Prescot and think they took her in the right direction. I hate the fact that Courtney Cox and David Arqette survived this outing. i thought is was placeable in the first one but outrageous in this one. The over all dark town of this film seemed to jive well with the continuation of the first one's more pastel look. Don't think I do not like this movie, because I do. It like the first one defined who I am and I could never complain about that as I like me. I just feel this film could have let Randy live an had Dewey and Gail die.

I think that everyone should watch all three movies Scream 1, 2, 3. All together they're a great set and great casting. However, I'd say that Scream 2 is my least favorite out of all three. But if you want to know the whole story it's a must see. One of the best things about this film is that Sarah Michelle Gellar is a part of the cast. She's a great actress and worth watching. She has one of the best death scenes in the movie. It's very important to watch the first one before Scream 2 and 3, you'll get more out of it if you do. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson are phenomenal creating one of the most chilling horror films of the late 90's. "},{"Title":"Just as good if not better then the original","Date":"25 July 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" Scream 2 is possibly the best horror movie sequel ever, and that's because it stays in touch with the ideas and plot structure of the first film, relying on the old clichés to give us another fresh and involving thriller. I'd even go so far as to say that this movie is superior to its predecessor, and that judgement lies with the character development and its comical treatment of the subject matter, while also being as cunning and inventive as Scream, keeping us at bay until the unexpected resolution.Scream 2 is a parodical look at the first film, beginning with a special screening of the new movie Stab, which is based on the book The Woodsboro Murders written by Gale Weathers. At the screening, two college students are brutally murdered by a man in that same old ghost mask. Not that he/she would be easy to spot the studio gave away Stab costumes to all the audience members, and everyone is running all over the place. The whole movie angle provides for some of the tension, because no one believes that the murders are interconnected, perpetuating the action.Soon, news of the murder gets back to Sidney Prescott, now a college student, who consults Randy, also at college, on what he thinks is going on. She now has a potential boyfriend, Derek, who appears to genuinely care for her, and friends Mickey and Halle, typical college students who are put into the story for good measure.Or are they? Like Scream, the sequel also makes everyone out to be a possible suspect through their actions and their words, which keeps the suspense unbearable in wanting to know who the killer is. As Sidney and others have their own opinions, reporter Gale Weathers, now a network reporter, retrieves her old ambitions and does everything to get the story, with exhonerated convict Cotton Weary, the man formerly accused of Sidney's mother's murder, chasing her for airtime. Not to mention the pesky reporter who looks up to Gale with every inch of her being.The film's shock quotient is extremely high, keeping us involved and wanting to know who is going to get killed next. Most of the murdered characters are secondary, leading up to murders of certain important actors that point to other as the suspects. The plot has all the machinations and clichés of the first film, again using it to its advantage in propelling its plot forward while giving those old horror tactics a fresh new look.What really makes this movie shine over the predecessor is the characterization of its characters. The Sidney of this movie is much stronger, much more stable than in the first movie, which provides a lot in keeping the movie going. Neve Campbell reprises her role, and does some of the best acting of the movie. The relationship between Deputy Dewey and Gale Weathers is intensified further here, and Courteney Cox and David Arquette are the perfect pair for the job. Cox especially shines here, bringing out more of Gale's ambitions which later become replaced with fear. Liev Schreiber portrays Cotton Weary, who really has nothing to do here but follow people around, but watch out for his chance to save the day.Telling you anymore than I already have will spoil the movie, which is full of surprises and stunning twists. This movie has a more adult feel than the first, which will provide for even more entertainment to moviegoers. There is so much fun to be had with Scream 2, which is solid entertainment full of suspense and intelligence.

Though she is still friends with all the survivors, Randy, Dewey and Gale(well sort of).

During the opening night of the film, a couple is brutally murdered. Sidney sees the news of the two murders, paranoia starts to take over. Randy, at the same college, tells her not to worry in between arguments with Mickey, a friend, that sequels ruin originals.

Sidney finds out about Randy's death, and Cotton is released from lack of evidence against him.Sidney and her best friend,Hallie, are told that they will be moved to a safe location until the killer is found. Derek says that he will wait for Sidney, then when Sidney is out of sight the phat boys take him to the theater because Derek gave Sidney his letters.they tie him to a prop, have a small party around him and then leave him there.

Sidney runs back to the college.Dewey and Gale are attacked while looking for evidence of the killer identity, Dewey is attacked and the killer, unable to reach gale, runs off.

Cotton frantically tries to tell her that he found Dewey and tried to help him. She runs out of the building and up to a pay phone that Debbie salt is talking on and calls the police telling them the murderer is Cotton.Sidney runs into the theater and onto the stage looking for someone. Then The set starts moving, and Derek is revealed still tied to the prop, drunk and out cold. Then as she begins to untie him, The killer steps onto the stage and pulls off his mask. Its Mickey, he pulls out a gun and says that without Derek there, hes been having to do all the killing that night. Sidney stops untieing Derek, Derek shouts that he not the killer and while swearing at Mickey, Mickey shoots him dead. As Mickey is explaining that he intends on blaming the movie for his actions, Gale walks in Followed by Debbie Salt who is holding a gun at her. Debbie salt tells them that she is Billy's mother. She then shoots Mickey down, Mickey shoots Gale, who falls into a large gap between the stage and the stairs leading to the audience's seats.Sidney runs away backstage and starts making the sets and props fall on Debbie, who is trying to shoot her. Then Debbie tackles her and puts a knife to her throat. They hear a gunshot during their fight, they look and see Cotton(who has Mickeys discarded gun). He is aiming it at Debbie. Sidney explains that Debbie is Billys mother and that the dead guy on the floor is the other killer. Debbie says that if Cotton lets her kill Sidney, then he'll be the one in the spotlight. Cotton tells Sidney that Debbie does have a point. Sidney looks unbelievably at him. Then he says that the interview is looking pretty good right now. Sidney says to consider it done. Cotton shoots Debbie in the lung. Then as Sidney and Cotton are looking at Debbie, Gale appears and it helped out of the Gap by Cotton while Sidney picks up the other gun. Mickey springs up and Gale and Sidney finish him with a couple of bullets, then Sidney shoots Debbie in the forehead. just to make sure.In the morning Dewey, who is found alive to Gale happiness, is taken to the hospital. Cotton finally gets his spotlight for being the hero and Sidney walks out in the press waiting for her.all in all this movie is pretty cool.

I have just recently watched it, and I thought I would tell you guys about it. Well, first of all, I loved the opening sequence with Jada Pinkett. I think that the SCREAM movies have a way of making you really feel sorry for it's victims. I was really surprised when Sarah Michelle Gellar (Cici) was killed so early in the movie. In my opinion, Cici was my favorite character in the SCREAM 2 movie. I thought it was really cool how she was incredibly calm while she was on the phone with the killer. I really loved her death scene. I mean, to get pushed through a window, stabbed two times, and then thrown off of the balcony onto concrete. I mean, that was a death scene right there. I was surprised, but happy about Randy's death scene. I am not a really big fan of Randy, and when he died, I heaved a sigh of relief. I do have a few dislikes about SCREAM 2. I really did not like the whole acting thing for Sidney. I thought it was boring. I wasn't at all surprised with the killers. I knew right off that Debbie Salt would be a killer, but i didn't know her motive. It all fit together when I found out that she was Mrs. Loomis. If you look at Mickey in the classroom, you can just tell that he looks like a killer. So I was not at all surprised when Mickey and Debbie Salt were the killers. I loved it in the end where Cotton saved the day. Cotton is one of my favorites. Everyone knows that is very rare that a sequel can overpass it's original. I'm so sorry, SCREAM 2 fans, but SCREAM is way better.

At some points it drags on a little but for the most part it proves to be very entertaining. More great performances from Campbell and Kennedy. Like all the other slasher movies each sequel is a little harder to believe that another killer wants the same person dead for a whole other reason but once you get past that this movie will give you a great ride.

The plot is almost identical to the first Scream. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a student at Windsor College. She has a new group of friends and is adjusting perfectly. That is until two college students are murdered at the opening night of 'Stab,' a movie based on the events at Woodsborro. Now the cast get killed in more bloody ways.David Arquette returns as ex-deputy Dewey, Courtney Cox returns as reporter Gail Weathers and Jamie Kennedy returns as Randy Meeks. The new cast consists of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Cici Cooper, Jerry O' Connell as Derek and Timothy Oliphant as Mickey.Scream 2 is a very good sequel, very rare these days, but isn't as good as the original.The acting is once again great. With outstanding performances by Arquette, Cox and Campbell. The script is once again great and the score still chilling. The film is bloodier than Scream with more deaths, as the rules have stated. Scream 2 also features a very well done scene about the discussion of sequels and if they have ever bettered the original.

Scream 2 tries to do what the original did which was to come up with a fantastic and shocking opening, now while i like the idea of the killer sat amongst people wearing the same outfit i did not think the opening was quite as good as the originals.The death scenes are a bit more gorier but very predictable. Something i don't always like in the script is that the killer always seems to fall down or seems to be clumsy, which is something i don't like because i think it becomes stupid and predictable.Kevin Williams script offers new characters, new settings but nothing much more than that. Having seen the first you know or you can best guess that there will be two killers, one you may probably expect the other was a shock for me but a super ending and a better one to what Williams had originally written.Wes Craven shows just why he's the master of suspense and horror by giving a good second helping of the Scream pie.Worth the watch but don't be surprised by the predictable deaths.

Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson bring in some new characters like Sidney's new boyfriend Derek Feldman (well played by Jerry O'Connell) but also some already known characters get a bigger part this time. The best example is Cotton Weary (very believable played by Liev Schreiber), but also Randy Meeks (again cool performance of Jamie Kennedy) can be seen again.Of course there some other new characters too but the you will soon recognize that the focus lies on Sidney, Dewey and Gale (Neve Campell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox).I don't think it makes any sense watching it without having seen the first part cause there are many references to it.In the very beginning of the movie Wes Craven also makes fun of or rather accuses the behaviour of the fans of splatter-movies. They are personated as violence-seeking almost mad crowd who can't wait to see some people getting slaughtered. A very shocking way how they are presented and it may be exaggerated but not that unrealistic. It makes you thoughtfully, but of course you don't have to deal with it and an also just enjoy the movie.My résumé is that if you like Scream you'll also like this one, although the only thing that has been approved is the hairstyle of Courtney Cox.

It is part of a trilogy, and sequels are for the most part inferior. Wes Craven knows this, lets get that out of the way. But when the fans want more, and when the story isn't finished, sequels are inevitably made. But it is still a good movie, still better than any over the other teen slasher movies of the period, and retains many elements which made the original so good.OK, now that we understand Wes Craven knew exactly what he was doing, we can discuss the good and bad points. Bad- too many unnecessary characters, though strangely many of them are not killed or even attacked, and most of them do not do much, the twists are too unpredictable to work well, and it is maybe too short. Now the good stuff- each performance is good, though the Killer (s) is (are) too over the top. Neve is excellent again, and i'm not only saying that because i'm a fan, but she has grown as an actress now coping with the fame Scream brought her, ironically mirroring the fame Sydney gets from what happened in Woodsboro. The Arquettes are both very good, Randy is very funny again, and the scares are pretty good. The police car scene stands out. Again the film deals with mistrust and uncertainty, like most of Craven's films, and we sympathies with Sydney's struggles- it seems inevitable that she will never put these events behind her, and that it will be a great struggle for her to get close to anyone- her relationship with her new boyfriend shows this (played brilliantly by O-Connell). The script is sharp, and there are many in-jokes. Overall it is a good film, but a continuation a story because the impact the characters of the first film had was so big, we had to see how they would move on. It cannot be as original or fresh (grr) as the first film, but that does not matter, that's not the point. 8 out of 10.

Scream 2 starts off with the traditional great first scene, centering around a couple who go to see the premier of Gale Weathers' movie Stab. And of course, they are both done in by a teen slasher wearing the same mask...it was y, but not as y as our good friend Casey Becker...This is how I saw the movie It was placed into two separate movie plots, all jointing together in the end. One plot followed Gale, Dewey and Randy, three survivors of the Woodsboro massacre. The other follows, of course, Sydney, her new boyfriend, Derek, Derek's friend Mickey, and one of her friends Hallie. (Yea, I know, Syd, Billy, Stu, and Tatum, haha). One scene starts with Gale, Dewey, and randy discussing the s and, of course, Randy receives a cell call, and who is it? The killer. And as Randy keeps the killer talking, Gale and Dewey interrogate everyone in the park talking on a cell phone. And it ends in Randy's and the killer's escape. Yes, Randy was killed, everyone. I bet you wish you got to stab Jamie Kennedy like he did.The plot then thickens. Gale and Dewey are then attacked in the school by the killer and Dewey is killed (?). As Sydney begins to evacuate the town, the killer attacks her as well She escapes into the school, and Hallie is killed. (Like Scream 1, yea...) Sydney is chased to the play stage where she finds Derek tied to a cross (!) and is chased by the masked killer. The killer turns out to be Mickey, and he soon accuses Derek of being his partner in crime, and kills him before he can free himself.Sydney then engages Mickey and evades him long enough for Mickey to introduce Sydney his real accomplice, and its the MOTHER of all surprises. No, its not Mickey's mother, and its not Sydney's mother, its BILLY'S MOTHER! How could you guess that? Gale is shot and so is Mickey and the old accused killer, Cotton Weary, comes to the rescue and kills Mrs. Loomis. Dewey is then found to be alive barely to end the movie.This is a very good movie, but the fact that the killer is unguessable is stupid. Both killers were not good choices, it would be cool to see something unexpected, like another fake  thing that might include Randy, maybe, but I guess I have no say. Also, many of the characters could be compared to the characters in Scream 1Derek - Billy (sorta) Mickey - Stu Hallie - Tatumwhich is not something I liked.

Given the clever, subversive nature of the first film, this sequel is almost critic-proof.  If anyone says this film is worse than the original, that would be countered by the idea that this is the point.  While not having the original's depth, this follow-up is equal to it's predecessor in term of shocks, suspense and cheeky humour.The action has moved from Woodsboro to Windsor College.  The events of the original have been turned into a film, Stab, and it is at a preview of this film that we meet two black Windsor students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) who bemoan the lack of African Americans in horror films.  Within the noisy atmosphere of the cinema showing, the pair are abruptly cut to shreds.  Pretty soon the bodies pile up and Sidney (Neve Campbell) and other Woodsboro survivors find themselves hunted by a copycat killer...The film's status as a sequel precipitates an early classroom debate on that very same subject.  The only sequel unanimously agreed to being better than it's original is The Godfather Part II.  All others, by their very nature. can only be considered inferior.  Later Randy (Jamie Kennedy) engages Dewey (David Arquette) in a short discussion on the rules of the horror movie sequel, where they also debate possible suspects.In the line-up this time round are Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber), a former murder suspect exonerated by the revelations of the last film.  Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), on the hunt for the prize-winning scoop, Sidney's boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell) film student Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Gale's fan Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) are all under suspicion.  The script by Kevin Williamson (who penned Scream) keeps things tight and plausible without convoluting his logic.  The killers, when revealed, are interesting surprises.  The main killer is a clever nod to the Friday the 13th films, while the sidekick turns the point of Scream completely on its head and offers to blame the movies for his actions.Cox and Arquette's onscreen courtship has lost none of its chemistry and Neve Campbell gives the film a strong central core as Sidney.  Jerry O'Connell gets a great singing scene as her ill-fated boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy is once again superb as loveable geek Randy.  Metcalf, Schrieber and Olyphant are on fine form, and British actor David Warner has a good cameo as Sidney's drama teacher.  Buffy star Sarah Michelle Gellar, playing a student, adds to the irony of the piece by running away from the killer instead of taking the fight to him.Wes Craven ratchets up the tension in style, milking the most out of the plot twists.  The film (well scored once more by Marco Beltrami) is shot well around the ancient, red-bricked college campus that provides a creepy setting for the carnage.Scream 2 is a superb sequel, and was followed by the comparatively average Scream 3.

Back with the original cast (YAY!), director (BIGGER YAY!), and complete with the same respect given to other horror films of our time, this movie even surpasses the original. The edge was still there, the suspense was brilliantly recaptured and the humor was dark and witty; clever and intelligent. All the successful key elements were present from the first installment of this series the acknowledgment by the characters that they are still in a horror movie; the use and discussion of other real movies thereby perpetuating the homage factor of thees movies; and the well developed, believable, lovable characters.You think someone is trying to make a real-life sequel? dramaprofessor.PLOT The killings have begun again. With the arrest(s) made in Woodsboro from the last rash of tragedies, everyone thought it was over. But Sidney's life just is not built that way. To think this fuss is all because of you. I mean, not directly, but in some 'Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon' way.With the return of Gail Weathers and Dewey Riley, it hits both Sidney and Randy that this is really happening, again. Wow. Nothing like a funeral to bring the family together. Randy.At the release of Cotton Weary from prison, Sidney is confronted with him face-to-face without warning or preparation. Needless to say, it doesn't go very well, and leaves Cotton standing there with his face hanging out, still waiting for his 10 minutes of fame.Meanwhile, Gail's book has defamed Dewey and he is none too happy about it. His pride is wounded and he has an axe to grind; primarily over Gail's head. His role is expanded and he gets far more screen time in this installment, which I found refreshing and his character to be delightful.As hard as it is to make a good sequel, incredibly Wes Craven manages to surpass the original and manages to truly SCARE us without being repetitive, redundant, predictable or boring. Amazingly well done, highly entertaining and a classic in the genre of horror.The suspense element is never cheapened, the element of surprise is always present and the performances by all involved is completely professional, believable and creatively presented.This production has well earned its reputation as a masterpiece in the horror field.The first installment of this series got an 8.89/10.

The first Scream, obviously, was a by-the-books horror film that worked, because it knew its own tricks, but fell into them anyway. Very post-modern. But Scream 2, in my opinion, is more of a comedy. The opening scene at the movie theatre is a hilarious send-up of the weird phenomenon that the original film became. The movie satirizes Hollywood and the media, showing how truly ridiculous it can be when the press latches on to a particular tragic story, blowing it out of proportion until it becomes less about the people involved and more about the very fact that it even happened. I, for one, loved many of the little in-jokes (it was my head on Jennifer Aniston's body). Granted, we'll have to explain them to our kids when they catch it on USA twenty years from now, but no one ever said it was timeless. And yes, the ending is weird and forced (though i do love the line, bob dole on the witness stand, IN MY DEFENSE) and lacks the surprise of the original. It certainly has its faults and doesnt live up to the original in many ways, but its still an entertaining ride. 7/10 stars  "},{"Title":"GREAT!","Date":"9 March 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  Scream 2 sees Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson team together once again to reunite Sidney Prescott with a masked killer This time we see survivors Sidney and Randy at college followed by Gale and Dewy after a series of copycat killings.

Scream 2 breaks the former rule, released a year  after the original, it's goal is to spoof horror movies by having a killer imitate them in his killings.  In the sequel,  it's goal is to have the killer imitate horror movie sequels.  Sound confusing? It is.One thing that most horror movie sequels have in common is that they all drag us through the same path that the original did, and end up being really weak.  Add that to the already rushed nature of this film and we have ourselves a film that pales in comparison to the original.  The part that these films always contained that entertained me is the entire who is the killer? feeling, I actually found it much more present in this one than the original, but in the end, it all falls  apart.The killers in the end are revealed to be two very underdeveloped characters, which destroyed the ending for me.As soon  as the killer took off his mask, my initial thought was Who is that?, then OK, I think I know who they are, what was their motives?.  Turns out that character's motive was that his accomplice would pay his tuition if he dressed up as a Ghostface  and killed people, (on a lighter note, wouldn't if have been a little easier just to rob a convenience store? Less blood  involved).  His accomplice turned out to be an annoying reporter-type character that was using that disguise to get closer to the university and get revenge against Sydney (very underdeveloped motive here).On a positive note, this film does build up the suspense quite well and the whole Whodunit? theme is very much present (I started pointing fingers to several characters throughout the film).  We do get more gore than present in the original and a general sense that the writers were serious about the whole sequel thing in the beginning of the film.  A little disappointing, definitely suffers from all the flaws that sequels do have.  Not as groundbreaking as the first one  was, still a decent watch though.5.5/10 "}{"Title":"ok movie","Date":"23 November 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  I saw this movie with 4 friends and the 5 of us, did got sick after the movie.

Suddenly survivors of Scream are brought together when a copycat killer attacks them and murderers classmates. Like in the first film you are left guessing who the killer or killers are until the end. The film is darker than its predesessor and lacks a bit of the magic which made Scream such a fun, thrilling and original film.  The infamous phone voice was dull this time around, not scary or interesting as it was in the first one.  The ending is also a little off.  While I find it reasonable or exceptable that Mrs. Loomis,(mother of killer Billy Loomis from part 1), was the brains behind her plan for revenge, it wasn't shocking as the revealing of the killers was in the first movie.  The first film tricked you until the end and made two likeable characters turn out to be deranged sickos which made it more effective.  In this film it was just like, 'oh okay your the killers'.

Kevin Williamson wrote the first, then the second, then the third - each encompasing a different hart of the overall teen-horror-slasher cliche`.First off - scream, was a turning poitn for hollywood horror - a well known cast of good lookings, a twisted plot and the typical elements of a slasher. the entire movie was a parody of both horror and itself, lining up and chopong down cliche` after cliche`, then came scream 2.Scream 2, lampooned one of the most despised artocies in the horror field - the sequal.  everyone knows that horror sequals suck so to try and get somewhere they always take on a different angle - trying to be more... horrific then the original.  Scream 2 does this - it drops an octave on the comedy and sarcastic aspects of the first, and turned up the volume on the evilness, if you will, on the events.  Drew Barrymore was disturbingly realistic as scream's first, but it is the faces of the cinema patrons that watch upon maureen, Scream 2's second victim - and it is things like this that give a more realistic view.  Scream 2 gives us a more heart pulling and gut wrenchingly realsitic view. some people have complained that there is no character development - there doesn't need to be.  the victims are selected due to their monikas Casey Cici Cooper, Maureen, Steven, ect - the names are the significance to the plot, not who they are.

After Scream, every horror movie copied its formula, hired hot teen actors, and made it a guessing game of who the killer would be. After a while it got too tiring. Now that the trend is dying off and movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween are pumping out more sequels this year, everyone can thank God that movie studios quit ripping off this great series. Sure, Scream started it all, but you have to realize that Scream is THE teen slasher of the '90s. It's the only slasher series that's actually worth a damn, and it's not the movie's fault that other people copied it to death. This series was almost ruined by imitators, making the audiences blame this series.The story is a little different here in Scream 2. The heroine Sidney has graduated and gotten out of Woodsboro to a secluded college. The other survivors have gotten on with their lives, too. Gale the reporter got rich from a tell-all book, Dewey deals with his new limp, and Randy coincidentally attends Sidney's college (what are the odds?). When a new movie called Stab opens, which is the film counterpart to the events at Woodsboro and Gale's book, the past comes back again as another ghost killer stalks Sidney's college buds.This movie delivers on all that Randy promises in the trailer. The body count is bigger, but some of the deaths are inconsequential unlike in Scream when the deaths were major characters. The death scenes are only more elaborate due to the new volume of blood. But compared to Drew Barrymore's scene in the first, this can't hold a candle to that. And the killer(s) should never be assumed dead because are they ever?This movie may seem like a pointless attempt to cash in on the money from the first, especially since not even a year had passed since the first opened, but keep in mind this is a trilogy. Just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.Not everyone will be satisfied with this. Taking the characters from Scream and shipping them out of Woodsboro takes something out of the  film. Woodsboro was a small town where terrible things were happening and everyone had something to hide. With great scenery and people, the setting was almost a character in itself in the first movie. Now that is all gone, replaced by a college campus. The set-up to murder is all the same here, even the killer's voice, but the scenes lack the impact they had in the first. The first had a better set-up. Most murders were out in the middle of nowhere. These occur on a campus with hundreds of kids about.This movie jokes about sequels never surpassing the original. This movie only helps prove that, but is still definitely worth viewing. It can't beat Scream, but it can almost match it. As part two of a trilogy this movie does just fine. But don't expect it to be an improvement. "},{"Title":"Worst In The Series","Date":"24 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  This isn't the best movie but you have to love it.

So...that isn't very original. It is pretty much just the first movie's script rewritten (only dumber). When we learn the identities of the killers, we think Oh yeah. But, they are both people who were underdeveloped. For one of the killers, we never really get to understand his motive, but hey. The other killer *POSSIBLE SPOILER* turns out to be one of those people who was secretly involved with the first movie. But, in this movie, we don't know about that until the very end. Which makes it just look like writer Kevin Williamson just made up that tie-in motive because he couldn't think of a better one. He too, obviously had no idea who he was going to make the killers out to be until he got to the part of the movie where the killers are supposed to be revealed. And that really isn't that good of a plan. Especially if you are writing a sequel. The main goal of a sequel is to surpass its predecessor. This sequel doesn't do that. Not in the least.

A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 was incredibly stupid.  Hannibal was a worthy sequel, but it wasn't even in the same league as the Silence of the Lambs.  Problem Child 2 had its moments, but there is no comparison to the original.  Further more, I Still Know and Urban Legends  Final Cut were movies that should have never been made because the originals were awful.  Scream 2, on the other hand, was a sequel that lived up to the hype and delivered just as many thrills as the revolutionary original.While the cast doesn't even stack up to the first Scream, Scream 2 gets a lot of solid work from the new additions, and the returning stars David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, and the scrumptious Neve Campbell all turn in great performances.  The plot was more complicated than the first because not only were we dealing with a copycat killer, but a new set of rules, rules that most sequels don't even follow.My only problem with the film is the choice of the new set of killers.  By now, you all know that Billy and Stu were the Ghostface killers from Scream, and I'm sure you know who the killers are in this installment, but if you don't, I'll just say that you may be disappointed.  The killers aren't significant enough to care about.I can't really hold that against Scream 2, though, because the list of characters to choose from was limited to three or four people, whereas in the original, it could have been six or seven different people.The death scenes were much more elaborate, and the death of Randy (sorry if I spoiled it for you) was pretty cool even though I loved the character.  Phil's death at the beginning of the picture was also awesome and it became one of the more popular scenes in recent horror history.In summary, Scream 2 is just as good as the original.  It delivers the goods.Scream 2 receives a perfect score of ****.  I'm not docking off any points just because I love the trilogy.

To sum up the sequel this is a movie that parodies itself and its predecessor. The characters in it do the things they were told exactly not to do in the first one. As well, a large part of the movie focuses in on whether a sequel can ever match the original. This one can't, but it is very creative. There is also the movie within a movie gimmick with 'Stab'. It mocks the horror genre with a cliched villain(a relative of one of the two original killers). Whether all of this is intentional or not(I lean towards it was), it makes for another good movie that knows it can't take itself too seriously.

Rather than discuss all the implausibilities in the movie, I'll just use the first murder as an example.SPOILERSScream 2 opens at a screening of Stab, the hugely successful movie based on the events of the first film.  Here's my first problem with the premise While I can buy the idea of there being a movie-within-the-movie based on the supposed real-life murders of the first film, I cannot believe that it would be marketed with such gimmicks as glow-in-the-dark knives and costumes based on the killer's.  Would any studio market a film about Columbine by selling tie-in trenchcoats and toy guns?  At screenings of Summer of Sam, were audiences cheering at the re-creations of real-life murders?  (Actually, considering the number of sick and/or tactless people out there, I probably shouldn't have asked that last question.)The first victim (who, we later learn, was deliberately targeted and not chosen randomly) enters a men's room.  Both urinals are occupied, so he goes into an empty stall.  He hears some bizarre whispering in the next stall, and puts his ear to the divider to hear better.  Suddenly, the killer plunges a knife through the divider and into his head.1. Since the killer was obviously already in the stall before the victim entered, how did the killer know his victim was coming into the restroom? (Keep in mind, the killer had this guy specifically targeted, and wasn't simply waiting for whoever happened to come into the stall.)2. How did the killer know that both urinals would still be in use when the victim entered, forcing the victim into the stall?3. How did the killer know somebody else wouldn't take the stall first?4. Okay, I can accept the killer knowing that the victim would put his ear to the wall to listen in (human nature being what it is)...but how did he know the exact point on the wall where his victim's head was?  Why didn't the knife emerge, say, in front of the victim's face, or an inch above his head?5. Since the killer seems to have counted on both urinals being occupied when the victim entered, how could he be sure that everyone else would leave while the victim was still in the stall?And that's only the first murder...sadly, the rest of the movie is no more plausible.

MAJOR SPOILERS!! for the rest of this comments now i'm mainly writing this to explain some things that the ppl who didn't like this film said was bad or unrealistic. so here goes.1. the killer mickey does seem realistic if u watch the movie again cause u will notice that he does carry a camera around ( most noticeable in the scene where u r once again introduced to gale weathers when she is listening to the police officers statement) and throughout the movie he is always pointing the finger at someone. but miss loomis i have to admit didn't have much of a clue but she too points the fingers at someone else such as the scene where she tells the other reporters that she thought it was supicious that sid's father was gone abroad again and u will notice that she and sidney never meet throughout the movie until the end. but i thought that having her as the killer was a very good twist and very surprising so i'm not complaining.2.in the car scene the camera focuses in on the gun because the killer then takes it for the finale and that explains why they had a long shot looking at it. and of course sidney and her roommate hallie wouldn't have noticed it, i mean they just escaped and they were probably bloody scared that the killer was going to grab their legs as they escaped.3. the horn sounded because her other hand was leaning on the horn when she was about to unmask the killer.4. they couldn't smash the windows because it's a cop car and the back windows r a lot more reinforced that the others and they also didn't want to make too much sound in case it woke the killer.5. in a who dunnit flick the killer always reveals himself to her main target, if he didn't then u would be pretty annoyed if u never knew who the killer was at the end of the movie and besides they thought that they were gonna kill sidney anyway so they weren't afraid to show her they're real identity.6. back to the car scene, sidney does try to take off the mask of the killer, the 1st time she gets scared cause of the horn noise and the killer might have woken up and remember she is still leaning over him, and the 2nd time she goes back but he killer isn't there. there i'm done answering the questions of the STUPID ppl who just didn't understand  the film (no offence intended). now just a quicky on how much i luv this film. the cast were once again brilliant and the i think that there were more suspense scenes in the sequel such as the car scene and the soundproof rooms. i also loved the camera shots throughout the movie most notebally (i have no idea how to spell that sorry) the final camera shot which goes over the whole university at the end. overall very very good definately not a bad sequel but not as good as the first one because that was the origianal one and that's hard to top but scream 3 is the best of all of them. so watch this movie it definately deserves a higher mark that imdb users gave it just because they didn't understand it so GO WATCH NOW.

When I saw it, I liked it but it just wasn't as good as the first. Many of the elements that made the first so good were absent and the Craven/Williamson connection just couldn't click twice...STORY It was okay, but kind of weak. In the first film, the revelation of the killers was a great twist. Here the murderers are two side characters that you never gave a damn about in the first place. The F13 reference was nice, but could've been far better done. Also, the movie is bogged down by rather pointless scenes, a somewhat slow pace, and a disappointing final confrontation. On the plus side, I liked how the characters progressed from the first film and it's nice that they didn't rethread the first movie's plot. I also really dig it when a main character is unexpectantly killed halfway through the movie.ACTING Neve Campell is good as usual, though I liked her better in the first film. Courtney Cox gets to expand her character beyond just being a bitch. I actually liked David Arrquette in this movie. So sue me. Jerry O'Conell bored the hell out of me. Timmy Olyphant was good, but more of him would've been nice. Jada Pinkett is annoying. Scary Movie was able to capitalize on that when it parodied this movie's openner. Jamie Kennedy works well as the comic relief. The chick from Roseanne is just as annoying as she ever was and was completely unconvincing...funny at times though. I also loved seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar in a cameo. Can't ya tell I'm a Buffy fan?DIRECTING Wes makes a suspenseful, bloody movie here. I think the final confrontation was too action oriented, but other than that...Wes helps save this movie.MUSIC Both the score and the soundtrack are inferior. Beltrami is solid, but his darker, grimmer soundtrack didn't come off well. Why did he have to reuse the crud from Broken Arrow? The soundtrack has some okay tunes, but is less satisfying than the original's.OTHER People bleed a lot more when they die in this one, but the first was more violent. Nothing special here except for that cop who ended up on the wrong side of the windshield. I'll say no more...Don't ask about tit shots. More politically correct stuff....Did anyone else think that Ghostface looked drunk in this movie? He had more grace in the first installment.Overall we have a decent, but inferior sequel.

The opening theater scene was just plain genius!  Great dialogue, GREAT casting (Jada and Omar make one terrific team!), and of course, horror!  It was very intense - I was VERY into it - and it was so clever how it was the complete opposite of Scream's opening scene (Casey was alone in a house, while Maureen and Phil were in a crowded theater/bathroom).  Although Casey's opening scene was scarier because you're more likely to get killed at home then in a crowded theatre, (and it was weird and far-fetched how no one noticed that poor Maureen was being stabbed to death) it was still just as clever and intense.Once again, Kevin Williamson delivers a script with witty dialogue and well-developed characters.  It may not have as great a plot as Scream and Scream 3, but considering it's a sequel to a masterpiece, I'd say it's good enough.  And, of course, Wes Craven is able to produce extremely intense, suspenseful death scenes, complimented nicely by another one of Marco Beltrami's magnificent scores.  My favorite scene was the car crash.  Completely terrifying!  It's great how just when Sid (Neve Campbell) and Hal (Elise Neal - pretty good actress) get out of the car and you can breathe a sigh of relief, Sidney decides to unmask the killer, and, unfortunately for Hallie, it backfires and the killer pops out again!I have to admit that guessing who the killer was wasn't quite as fun as in the first, but the identity of one of them (Billy's mother - played well by Laurie Metcalf) was a great twist and made up for it.  Also, Mickey (Timothy something) was just as funny as Stu in the original.I was heart-broken when Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and CiCi (Sarah Michelle Gellar) died (I'm a big fan of Buffy) but their performances were superb nonetheless.  Jerry O'Connell was even pretty good as Derek, Sid's new sane boyfriend (my sister always goes ga-ga over his cafeteria singing scene) and Liev Schrieber was great in his biggest role of the Scream movies; he made a good possible suspect.  Neve, David, and Courtney do great jobs as well reprising their roles.It would be unfair to say that this is just as good as the original (after all, Scream is a masterpiece), but Randy was wrong all sequels DON'T suck!

This movie was a complete story by its own . But after the success of Scream the continuation chapters were inevitable . Although Scream 2 obviously does not compare with the first part it has some major improvements . The first is that the plot unfolds much more continuusly than the first. There is not an inch of dead time since the non action scenes are used for the dramatic development of the characters like the theater scenes . In Scream the parts where Sidney (Neve Campbell) was whining about her mother were kind of annoying . Also Jamie Kennedy was kind of irritating as Randy the last time . Here he is more mature and reliable without overacting and screaming . Also (thank God) there are less quotes from other movies just the necessary amount .PLOT  2 years after the gruesome murders in Woodsborow the events of Scream were made a movie called Stab based on the best seller book by the reporter Gail Weathers (Corteney Cox) . During the avant premiere a gory murder takes place in the most tragic way ( I won 't say more than this is better than the Drew Barrymore opening!!) Soon it becomes clear that a psychopath has decided to be the successor of the killer in Stab and has focused on the University campus where Sidney and Randy are now students . He is a copycat killer following precisely the same methods . The threatening phone calls , the black costume with the ghostface mask and the knife-using bloody slasher killings. Gail Weathers arrives on the scene to help the police and fulfil her own ambitions as well . The story is very good and the cast reunion is effective. The psychological horror is once again inherent  the maniac can be literally anyone . An obsessed movie fan who sadistically wants to poke his fun to Sidney by reviving her worst nightmares . It is very chilling since most of us have suppressed fears and subconciously always live in the sheer terror they might resurrect . Apart this psychological factor the writer made sure to give a motive almost to everyone . Even the most unconfessed motives are apparent . For example Dewey (David Arquette) and Randy are never exposed for their possible obscure motives but anyone with a common sense of logic can guess their motives for being the killers . Despite a few original scenes there are more chliches than the last time , unfortunately . E.g. Cicy is a supporting cast so you know she doesn 't stand a chance to live . The trapped in the car scene no matter how suspensful , it is contrived and very stupid . And finally the ending  the biggest flaw is that the killer 's motive is stupid or even better inexistant . There is a shocking revelation but it does not compensate for the bad taste the ending leaves us . It is not only disappointing but it is unrealistic and , even worse , not suspenseful. As soon as the killer is unmasked the agony freezes . In Scream that point was simply the beginning for the edge-of-your-seat climax .I will have to warn you though that the fault is not the writer 's , at least totally . Kevin Williamson 's original draft is rumoured to be darker , had a different killer and better ending with a cliffhanger to be answered in #3 (it is obvious the obsession of Williamson with the Star Wars trilogy) . Probably the director or the producers changed it for PC reasons . Overall Scream 2 is a good sequel . It is worth seeing to keep up with the story . It has some good scenes but it is utterly destroyed by the ending . Bewarned . I haven 't seen Scream 3 but I hope it will restore the memory of the series .SCREAM II          7.5 / 10 "},{"Title":"i wish they would stop making those movies","Date":"26 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  If Scream 1 was digestible, Scream 2 is not and I have no intention whatsoever to see Scream 3.

It's one thing to make the killer the person you least suspected, but only when the viewer can think back through the movie and realise that it was them all along. Unfortunately in this movie, there were no clues at all to suggest it was them, except possibly when they were on the phone after the stabbing in the school AV room.Spoilers followAs far as scary movies go, it was okay I guess, but the characters - were just so stupid sometimes.. I mean .. the car crash.. that was just ridiculous! - There were so many 'clues' in the film, yet they never came to anything. We see the killer smash in the window then cut the cop's throat, yet Sid and her friend are somehow unable to smash their own windows out, from the inside (she can't kick maybe ?), so they are forced to crawl over the unconscious body of the killer to get out. Then the other cop.. jeeze.. before they drive off, he stands up, with his gun, directly in front of the car, while the killer (who has already killed several people including the other cop, by this point, so there's no doubt that he'd have no problem killing the remaining cop) is in the driver's seat.. and instead of just shooting him, the cop waits until the killer is comfortable and ready to drive, then, stupidly, gets himself run over, and knocked onto the hood.Okay, so that was stupid, but he's still there, and he's got his gun - so what does he do with it ? Nothing! He just hangs in there waving it at the killer, but doesn't actually fire it.. maybe he doesn't keep it loaded ?And then... they have the crash, and we get a nice clear full screen shot of the guy dead with his head half through the windshield, and with his hand.... *still* holding his gun.  After Sid and her friend get out of the car (after climbing over the killer), they stand there, next to the car... next to the gun, and yet.. seem oblivious to its presence.The killer has a knife.. a short distance weapon. Wouldn't a gun be handy right about now ?.. but no......   and I was left wondering why the hell they showed us the gun, and the easily smashed window, in the first place.When you get a full screen closeup on something, it's *supposed* to show that there's something significant in the shot.. but not in this movie. You sure don't have to think to keep up with the plot.There were lots of other scenes where things could have turned out a lot better if a few more intelligent choices had been made - when the killer was in the dorm, near the start of the movie.. and her cordless phone was cutting out... couldn't she just have gone and used a phone somewhere else ?.  Notice how nobody in the movie had a mobile ? .. and how her security system never went off despite her clearly turning it on, then having several people running through the house.I think the script could have done things a lot better by shutting out the more obvious alternatives, and making the viewer really start to wonder about how they could get out of the current situation. As it stood, there weren't any really scarey scenes, because I never believed there was much of a threat - it was mostly a result of the characters doing something stupid, and then finding themselves in a pretty bad situation.Having said all that, it wasn't that bad a movie for a horror film. It just wasn't terribly believable either.  I still enjoyed watching it, but they could definitely have done better, *especially* with the credibility of the killers when they are finally revealed at the end.As a comparison, the movie 'The usual suspects'  http//www.imdb.com/Title?0114814  did (brilliantly) exactly what I wanted to see more of in this movie - you don't suspect the real killer, but when they are finally revealed at the end, everything falls into place and you suddenly understand all the clues that didn't make much sense up until then.Of course, I might be making too big a deal of this - it is only a horror film after all.

It is a good, but ridiculous, horror flick. I think that part 2 is the worst of the Scream-series, but nevertheless good. I can understand why someone dislikes this movie, because the characters sometimes act very stupid ( e.g. the car crash - if you have seen the film ). The story  While watching &#132;Stab ( which deals with the incidents of &#132;Scream ) two people are killed. The police has not any suspicion, because everyone wears those &#132;Stab-dress. The next day Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is frightened because she gets a phone call by  the killer ( the killers ??? ). During the following days many people are killed by the murderer / murderers. In the end Sidney Prescott and the TV-correspondent Gale Weathers ( Courteney Cox ) meet the killer/s in the auditorium of the school. The final showdown begins....I have to admit that I usually like all horror films, and this one is no exception. Although it is one of the more ridiculous ones, it is nevertheless scary. The actors are quite bad. It exaggerates in the end. If you try to keep yourself a secret from everybody ( by wearing a mask ) , you do not take your mass off voluntarily, do you ?!? But that is the same as in Scream 1 and Scream 3. Question #1 Why did Sidney and her friend not take the mask of the guy in the car, who is unconsciously. Question #2  How is it possible to sound one´s horn if you try to take the mask of the guy ?Question #3  The killers kill everyone almost as fast as possible, right ? But why do they make a sensation with killing Sidney ? She is their main-victim, but they just do not want to kill her ? WHY ?????This is definitely not one of the best horror movies. But it is a good one.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of horror films or to fans of the Scream-series ( of course ). I am pretty lucky that a film ( &#132;Scary Movie ) made fun of these horror movies.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

A killer copycats the murders from Woodsboro, exactly in the week of the premiere of Stab, movie made after the events in the first part.Scream 2 does a very good job with the story and the action scenes very well done and some of them very tensed. Still the phone-terror used in the first part is not that developed and scary. Except for this element, Wes keeps everything that goes well in the original. Including the very clever dialogue that worked so good in Scream.After a surprising success (nobody expected Scream 2 to be a good movie, after the fabulous first part), Wes Craven should've stopped while he was on top. But he didn't. He chose more money in stead of being the undisputed God of horror films. And so Scream 3 was born much much weaker and stupider than the first 2. Scream 2 was very good and if you're a fan of horrors go watch it. You'll like it. Vote 8 out of 10.Oh, one more thing. What's your favourite scary movie? Showgirls.

But that was before the opening night of 'Stab', the movie account of the horrific slayings at Woodsboro, based on the best-selling book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox).

Since a trilogy was thought of after the first one came out, obviously they had to come up with a sequel. If you want to follow the entire Scream story, than see this. If you would like to enjoy the first one as it is and not even bother with two more, than don't waste your time. Scream 2 is almost as entertaining to watch as the first one. During the first ten minutes or so, two people are murdered. What will follow? Everybody's reaction is to think that there's going to be tons of different and exciting killing scenes to occur throughout the film. Wrong. I'm not one for watching detailed slaughter shots. They don't bother me and I won't deliberately turn away, but what's the point of having all of the characters die when there is not a strong reason to back it up.The variety of stabbings will keep the slasher film fans content. However, it's pretty easy to predict who is going to die next. It comes to the point where whenever you see a new character introduced, your first thought is 'oh, they're going to die too.'One of the problems with this film is that there are too many actors involved. The survivors from Scream return and are now working with Derek, Cotton, Mickey, Debbie, etc. Another problem is that a lot of the actors are given a part just so that their character can die, but serve absolutely no purpose to the plot. CiCi, Hallie, Phil, and Maureen will fall under this category. ~*spoiler~*The writing is all right if you're not looking for anything too complicated. Scream revealed that Billy was the killer because Maureen was having an affair with his father. That story works out okay. Scream 3 pulled all the loose ends together and explained everything during the first two movies. This movie has nothing to go off of. When I found out that the killers were who they actually were, I was very disappointed. I can partly accept the fact that Billy's mother returns, but I cannot understand why Mickey was involve. Apparently they needed two killers in order to follow in the steps of the first film, but this just doesn't work. Mickey's character isn't even given that much exposure before it is revealed that he is one of the killers. Neither is Debbie's character. A few lines here and there to Gale, and that was it. If you're going to present a horror movie to us, than give us a good ending to wrap it up with.The only thing more annoying than Neve Campbell still sitting high on the scream queen thrown, is the way that the killers were indestructible. Throughout the years, having killers that just won't die have become very popular and very unrealistic at the same time. The fact that we had to wait until the end to find out who they really were was one explanation as to why they couldn't die. My opinion is that the crew ruins a movie by doing everything necessary to kill off the murderers, but it is impossible for them to actually die until it is at the end and in a convenient situation.I'll say it again. This movie will please any Scream fan, but it wasn't a must to make. The story could have been left as a sequel with this one cut out, the third installment moved into the second place and the first one left as it was. A little confusing but I'm sure that with a few minor changes given to Scream 3, everything would have worked out okay.

It doesn't seem fresh, has a thin storyline, contrived characters, plays like a rehash, and concludes with an ending that seems patched on and is completely unsatisfying.Scream 2 starts up with a fantastic shocker of a scene, where a murder takes place in a movie theater showing the film Stab, a spinoff of the events in Woodsboro in the first Scream film.  It's a terrific opening, as we see that Neve Campbell is now in college and is unnerved by the killing, suspecting it could be the 'sequel' she was warned about in the first installment.While the movie may start with a fantastic, twisted scene, it's all downhill from there.  The survivors from Scream are back, and their familiarity helps bolster the sometimes slow, plodding scenes.  There's also much more gore here, but while Scream used it sporadically, Scream 2 certainly seems to rely on it to shock its viewers rather than the clever, manipulative scripting of the first.  The device of revealing the horror movie convention doesn't seem as fresh anymore; instead it seems like a cheap convention itself.Not to say there aren't some scenes in Scream 2 that aren't wonderfully shot by Wes Craven, including a thrilling (if not too short) car chase, a frenzied search for a cell phone, and a poignant death.  But it's ending is much too farfetched and strikes the viewer much like the killer strikes with his knife completely out of nowhere, without warning.Scream is by far the superior of the trilogy, feeling much more inventive than this sequel.  When a film student in the movies remarks that the sequel destroyed the genre, you can't help but feel it's true at the end of this movie.

This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).

"},{"Title":"Furthers the series nicely, but.....","Date":"13 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  Warning, may contain some spoilers.The problem with most horror films now a days is that they are vacuous.  There is a notion from a great many aspiring film makers that they can break into the business the same way that perhaps Carpenter and Moustapha Akkad did.  Carpenter, as we all know, made the legendary Halloween and Moustapha Akkad financed it for him.  That film broke all sorts of barriers and not only was it a good film, but it scared people.  In the early 90's, you had an apathetic audience without a modicum of desire to see horror films.  The genre had run its course with so many ersatz so called horror films, that no one gave any credit to even the good ones that were released.  But that all changed in 1996 when Wes Craven was smart enough to take a brilliant script by Kevin Williamson and turn it into something that all horror fans and movie fans could appreciate.  Scream became something of a legend.  This was a film that ostracized all of the banal efforts from the last decade and justified the horror film once again.  This was a film that respected the greats from the past like Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th.  It gave a rebirth to a stale genre and made it fresh.  I, for one was thrilled with Scream and even though there are now a slew of inferior horror films launched into mainstream, every once in a while you get films like Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  These films make it easier to stomach all of the Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summers and so on.  Scream 2 carries on the story from Scream and it sets us up for the final installment.Is Scream 2 any good?  Your damn right it is.  But it is not quite as good as Scream is.  But that is okay.  Halloween 2 was great but not as good as the first and the only Nightmare that was nearly as good as the first was the last one.  So as sequels go, this is a very fine one. Sydney is now attending college with her pal Randy.  She is hoping that all the fuss from her Woodsborough days are over but there is now a film being released that is based on the murders ( and in a great tongue in cheek moment, Tori Spelling plays Sid in the movie Stab ).  So there is now media attention once again hurled her way.  Then at a local screening of Stab, two of Sid's college cronies are murdered thus lending credibility to theory that it is starting all over again.  Soon Gale shows up and then Dewey.  Gale shows her face for the media attention and Dewey is there to protect her.  So we now have all the major principals in place. Soon, people begin to die and we now have a full fledged psychopathic killer on the loose again with an ominous sounding voice.  As Randy alludes to almost coyly, too coyly for it not to mean something, Scream 2 doesn't really solve anything.  Sure it is revealed that the killer happens to be Billy Loomis' mom and she has her own reasons for wanting Sid dead, but just as in Empire Strikes Back, there is always room for more story.  The ending of this film offered a conclusion, but there just seems to be something still lurking beneath the surface.  And this is where I have my theories. Bear with me here.Randy says that Empire wasn't really a true sequel, that it was a planned part of a trilogy and that is obviously true of Scream.  Kevin Williamson may have started out with just a really neat idea about a horror film that parodies other horror films, but by the time he reached the second film, he knew there was enough material here to make three films, and in my mind, it will be four.  You see, I don't think the killer is really caught.  In Scream it was Stu and Billy, in this one it is Mrs. Loomis and in the third one it is, anyway, you get the picture.  But at the end of Scream 3, there is that feel to it that tells you that something further could happen.  Even at the end of Friday the 13th, the final chapter, Tommy's eyes are all bugged out and the producers were basically telling you that this was not the last installment.  And in Scream 2, I think there are real clues as to who the real killer is.  When Randy is killed, we almost all but forget his conversation with Dewey about them both possibly being suspects.  Because with him gone, he is obviously not a suspect anymore, but why not Dewey?  Especially in this film, he is always around when the killings happen, and as he said about Derek when he was slashed on the wrist, he himself always just happens to get hurt but not fatally.  There are also shots of him in this film and in the first one wearing the same type of boots that the killer does.  To me, just like in Star Wars, there has to be a fourth one.  The script is all but jumping out at us and how many films have just stopped after making 4 films?  Scream could make history by doing so.  There are just way to many possibilities and none of the doors have been shut on Dewey being the killer.  Anyway, back to the film itself.  It does a nice job of furthering the story and Randy and his film class have some nice moments when they discuss movies and their sequels.  This film also does a nice job of famous cameos.  Joshua Jackson, Rebecca Gayhart, Portia DeRossi and Sara Michelle Gellar have small but fun roles in the film.  Actually the cast is well assembled in the film.Overall, Scream 2 is not quite as good as Scream but that would have been impossible anyway.  It is however, a good film and it does plenty to set up Scream 3.  This is a good second installment to the famous trilogy. 8 out 10- Looking forward to the 4th one, if they can get the principals to come back....

I thought Hallie had a chance of being 1 of the 2, that would've made more sense since she was in the movie more, or Randy would've been alright considering he wasn't in the movie that much at all but he had his good scenes and as far as everyone else goes...nothing much to say except they shouldve killed off Dewey and also should have had Joshua Jackson more involved the movie then just a cameo...he would've been a good addition to the movie and for Buffy well she didnt deserve to be killed off but it happens and they way she got killed was disappointing, why run up the stairs...theres no where to go, that was a downside.

"},{"Title":"So many flaws it is surprising that the film is still enjoyable (!SPOILERS FOR SCREAM 1&2!)","Date":"20 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  What'd I expect? I mean, Scream was absolutely outstanding. It combined suspense, fun and originality in a never-before-seen way. To come up with a sequel that is better than Scream is a mission impossible. I was aware and prepared that Scream 2 wouldn't beat the original. But still I was fairly disappointed. Scream 2 had almost none of the cleverness and wit that made its predecessor so originally entertaining. In addition, it changed the characteristics of some of the persons from the first one which was very confusing.The story was basically a repetition of the first Scream (which isn't that tragic) but with less twists and surprises in it. In Scream we had the time to get to know all the important characters including the killers but it still wasn't easy to guess the killer right. In the end there was this unique experience Oh, of course it was them, why didn't I realize this earlier?!. When I watched the film again I had to admit that everything perfectly fit. Scream 2 totally failed in this point. The reason why it was almost impossible to figure out who the killers were, is that they had nearly no screentime until the very end. It could as well have been Norman Bates or Santa Claus. It is very easy to hide the killers by not showing them at all.But nonetheless, Scream 2 had some pretty cool scenes. The opening scene in the movie-theatre at a sneak preview of Stab (a movie based on the events at Woodsboro in Scream) was excellent. Like in the original Scream it was very cruel, sadistic and maybe even more inventive. It didn't have the same impact one me though. This scene left me hoping for more. Another exciting scene includes Randy, Dewey and Gale Weathers standing on the lawn of the college. They get a call from the killer who is able to see them. They run around trying to find him/her even attacking some students. But then, in my opinion, Williamson made a big mistake by killing Randy. His death in the very same scene deeply disturbed me. Not because it was too cruel or anything like that. There was just something wrong with it, I thought he was the wrong person to get killed and that he should be among the survivors. They'd rather have killed Sidney Prescott, that would have surprised everybody and made this series unique! (Remember Randy I'd let the geek kill the girl.)One more good scene that comes to my mind was the one in the sound studio which was very thrilling. Dewey is trying to call Gale through the soundproof pane when the killer is attacking him from behind. That was very clever. But again I have a small complaint What does it need to kill Dewey? A nuclear bomb? Normally the lunatics are the ones that are (almost) immortal but no matter how much he gets stabbed, he doesn't die!There are some very illogical scenes too, for instance when Sidney first runs away from the car, then decides to go back to see who the killer is. And the two agents that are supposed to protect Sidney Were they on the drugs? My grandmother moves faster than these two did, and believe me, my grandmother is not that young anymore!The irony that made Scream so amusing is reduced to a minimum in this sequel. The discussion about sequels was nice to watch but other than that...almost nothing. Why did they eliminate one of the most important elements? Instead we see all sorts of persons having all sorts of psychological problems. Sidney is still suffering from what happened to her at Woodsboro. Her boyfriend is not that happy either because his relationship to Sidney is starting to fall apart. Dewey has become a complete ghost. That kind of naive touch that he used to have made him the most enjoyable person in the first film. And Gale Weathers now feels alone and abandoned (*sniff*). Even the dead people are not happy. It seems as if all the persons have been replaced by emotionless robots. Especially Dewey has lost all his charm. The whole film is more like a psychological drama than a teen-horror slasher and that is not what I was hoping for.If Craven had deleted some scenes, the movie wouldn't be that boring either. Some elements are weird, some are boring and others are weird and boring at the same time. Sidney belongs to a theatre group. I guess it was supposed to make Sidney look more like a real person but in fact it just slows down the film. And I didn't quite understand the point of Sidney's boyfriend being abducted by some freaked teens. I think it was only used to explain why he appeared in the final scene.Let's face it Stu and Billy were not that agile. But in Scream 2 the killer simply runs into every single obstacle. I wasn't quite sure if he wasn't even blind. I found myself laughing at him several times, especially when he followed Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and stumbled over the couch etc..But despite of all these flaws mentioned above the film still could have been far above average. But they decided to shoot one of the most pointless and boring endings in movie history. Mickey was quite a good psycho but Debbie Salt aka the mother of Billy was about as frightening as a banana. Laurie Metcalf tried to pull off some kind of Mrs. Voorhees-thing but she is so implausible that it gets ridiculous. Scream 2 turned out to be one of the only films in horror history to end with a shoot-out, not very scary either...Don't get me wrong. Scream 2 is still one of the best films in this newly discovered genre (teen slasher). It's just way worse than the original. It is illogical and boring at places. But overall it is still enjoyable and provides decent entertainment (except for the ending).My rating 6/10 "},{"Title":"Fantastic sequel!","Date":"19 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  **Includes spoilers from Scream 1**                              I remember that I missed ''Scream 2'' when it was on the cinema, cause I thought                               that the first scream-movie was overrated and bad (after seeing it again I must                               say it is one of my best ever) so me and my friend who both are huge                               scream-fanatics rented this movie over a night, both very excited about this new                               sequel.

Here we have some new butcher-victims to ''slice                               and dice'' and Craven really follows those sequel-rules. The biggest different                               between S2 and its original is the amount of blood. This is what you can call a                               ''blood-show'' where the victims are lined up to get knives stucked up here and                               there. In the first movie I figured out pretty soon who the killers were (or it was at                               least my theory all the way out), but here it was so many people to choose from                               and that made it fun! It is ''Cluedo'' all the way, but when the killer (or killers,                               maybe killress) got revealed it was a slightly bad pick. Otherwise ''Scream 2'' hits                               bullseye and for you who liked the first screammovie will NOT be dissapointed                               on the sequel.                              8/10  "},{"Title":"Not quite as good as the first","Date":"31 March 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  Scream 2 takes place two years after the events of Scream.

I liked the idea of the incidents in the first Scream movie becoming a box-office smash called Stab, where souvenirs and costumes of the killer are bestsellers.  It was funny, original, and poked fun at sensationalism.  However, Scream 2 was not much different from the first one, and it was not nearly as scary.  There was a sort of seen that, been there taint and some scenes were scary, like the one where Sidney climbs out of the car over the killer, while still others wasted time.  There were also moments when it got a little weird, like the scene where Sidney's new boyfriend is carried away by crazed kids who tie him to a prop used for a play, strip him, and pour beer on him.  That left me scratching my head.  The biggest flaw though is the revelation of the killer.  I couldn't help but go Aw, c'mon! when the killer's, or killers' identity was revealed.  I am still curious about the 3rd Scream, and just because I didn't like Scream 2 as much as it's predecessor doesn't mean that I didn't have as much, if not more fun watching it.

I liked SCREAM 2 for the same reason. The story line is pretty much the same as in SCREAM, but I thought the acting, characters, and death scenes were all better.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone off to college to become and actress. Now that she has left her past behind her, she is doing better. She has a new best friend/roommate named Hallie (Elise Neal), a new boyfriend and a new life. But when somebody starts killing people in the same style of the killer, Sidney finds out that her past has come back to haunt her. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), old prime suspect proven innocent of the murder of Sidney's mom from SCREAM, returns to try and get publicity for his part in all of this. Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) returns as the movie expert and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) return to try and protect Sidney.The plot is pretty much the same as SCREAM, but instead of poking fun of horror movies, they poke fun at sequels. When the college students argue about whether sequels can be better than the original, it's priceless.The acting is even better in this movie than in SCREAM. Neve Campbell does her usual teriffic job. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are even better in SCREAM 2 than they are in SCREAM. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jada Pinkett are the equivilant of Drew Barrymore in SCREAM. They both do fair jobs, especially Sarah. Liev Schreiber and Jamie Kennedy do great jobs, and Roger L. Jackson returns at the bitchin' phone voice. (By the way, in a movie full of the biggest teenage stars of today, Joshua Jackson has a good cameo.)The character development is even better in SCREAM. You will, once again, find yourself screaming at the characters to run and get away. Sidney and Gale are just as cool as they were in the first one. Dewey and Randy are both extremely better characters in this one than in SCREAM. In SCREAM, Randy was annoying and an almost pointless character. In SCREAM 2, he's my favorite. The addition of Cotton Weary in this movie is suberb.I thought SCREAM 2 was better than SCREAM. Most people will think it is just as good or almost as good as SCREAM. If you didn't like SCREAM, don't bother watching SCREAM 2. But if you, like me, enjoyed SCREAM, this is a must-see.

Then when I saw it a couple more times, I noticed the problems of the movie. Although the script is as fresh with its characters and dialogue, some scenes in the movie are very predictable. It wasn't scary at all. The main killer at the end was stupid, I admit that. I loved the first killer that you found out about, as well as his/her motive. But then the movie introduced the partner, who turned out to be the main killer. It was really stupid. They cast the wrong person for it, and it just didn't work in many respects.Now, with the problems out of the way, I can tell you about the good things about the movie. I absolutely loved the whole idea of Stab in this movie. It created something totally different in the new movie world. For those of you who have not seen the movie, Stab is a movie-within a-movie based on the events in the first Scream. Tori Spelling plays Sidney, David Schwimmer plays Dewey, etc... It was very clever. It was also just as funny as the first one, and I was roaring with laughter during the scene when Dewey sees Gale and has a little talk about her book. Jamie Kennedy was in the spotlight for most of the film, and he did just as good a performance as Randy as he did in the first one. The whole cast of new people fit the Scream team very well, especially Jerry O'Connell, Sid's new boyfriend away at college.So, all in all, the movie was very good despite its weak ending and its sometimes predictable storyline. I used to think it was the best Scream, but the more I think about it, the more it's the worst one. It still is very good, though, and is a worthwhile and worthy follow-up to the greatest horror movie of the 1990's.

It was very good and broke away from all the mediocre horror sequal that were the only exposure to the not-quite-as-serious genre of Horror to a new breed of teenagers.  Scream 2 was exactly what was right about the first, but exelled in a completely different direction.  *Spoiler* While I admit that the killers were strongly underdeveloped and just did not work very well.  Fortunately, Laurie Metcalf is such a skilled comedical actress that she was able to pull off a scene that Timothy Olyphant destroyed, although you can hardly blame Timothy for his lack of scenes.  Other than that, the movie was perfect.  Every scene was full of action, and each scene became increasingly better as the movie moved on.  The movie did not seem at any time too long.  After seeing the movie for the first time, I loved it.  I was not at all disappointed.  I was only worried that the new would wear off of Scream 2 and upon second viewing it would not live up to its first viewing.  It never did.  What I loved best about the movie was Gale's extended role, which fills in what Sidney's role takes away.  I thought the killing off of an original character was a brilliant move, and really shocked me upon first viewing.  What more, they made sure to do it near the begining of the movie, so that for the rest of the movie your were left to wonder if they'd kill one original character, would the kill another?  I thought this wonder was most evident during the scene in which Gale is trapped in the sound room, when any movie-goer was wondering if she would survive.  I, also, loved the scene when Sidney was trapped in the police car.  Several people have deconstructed the movie way too much.  It was definately more entertaining than the first.

After the opening scene, which was great, I thought Scream 2 spiraled downward and every scene was worst then the one before it, finally wrapping up with the worst ending ever seen on film. I hated this movie. That is, until I was able to see it again on video. Sometimes it takes a second viewing on video to really concentrate and pay attention to all the little details to really appreciate a movie. This is one of those movies.   While I still believe the ending was terrible, I thought the rest of the movie gets better every time I watch it. The opening scene is fantastic, and (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I loved the idea of the killer sitting in the movie theater amongst hundreds of look-alike killers, with nobody knowing who the killer is or if he's even there. As Jada Pinkett finds out in a very clever scene, he is there.   I thought the best scene in the movie occurs when Randy, Dewey, and Gail are standing in the grass courtyard at the college, and the killer calls them on Gail's cell phone, playing games and watching them from a distance. I love the camerawork used while following Randy around as he searches for the killer. One shot in particular has the camera looking down on him from the sky, nobody else visible in the whole shot, which gives a feeling of me against the world, which Randy must have been feeling. The whole scene is great.   Is Scream 2 better than the original? No, but you can't compare a sequel to its original, because it will never compare (as they discuss within the movie.) Sequels by definition alone are inferior films Scream was one of the few horror movies I could truly call great, and Scream 2 is likewise one of those rare sequels that at least approach the quality of the original (such as with Lethal Weapon 3 & 4 and Die Hard With a Vengeance).   Now for the ending. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) They hinted throughout the movie as to the killers identity Mrs. Voohries was a terrific killer But I never thought they would cop out and go for the simple answer of Billy's mother? She was terrible as the killer, and did nothing but annoy me the entire movie. Mickey at least was interesting, but his character was barely even developed and then, all of the sudden, here he is, your serial killer. I thought for sure going in that Stu somehow survived the first Scream and was coming back for part two, and when they introduced Debbie Salt as the killer, my heart took a dive. The ending was pathetic, and I still hold out hope of a decent killer in part 3 (maybe Stu), but I still give it a 9 out of 10, with the ending keeping it from a 10.

Which is fine, but I think that neglects most of the genuinely fine aspects of this film.In Scream, apart from the Drew Barrymore sequence at the start, most of the thrills were delivered by shock effect. Shock effect can be fantastic, but ALWAYS suffers from the law of diminishing returns (as do most sequels). Scream 2, however, has one of the best suspense sequences ever put on film. Towards the end of the film, Sid and her room-mate are in the back of a patrol car and the killer has butchered the two cops and taken control. The car then crashes. It's a patrol car, so Sid and Hallie are trapped in the back. The only way out is to peel down the damaged steel mesh, climb over the unconscious killer in the driver's seat and out of the window. It's that simple.If that doesn't work for you, you're watching the wrong movie. Go rent The Sound of Music (now that's scary).So what happens? Sid climbs out first, after glaring straight into the blank mask over the killer's face, and is safe. So we all assume Hallie, a supporting character, is done for. We know, she's going to climb over the killer, who is suddenly going to come round and before she can say OUCH THAT HURT she's a gonner. No. We were wrong. Okay, she's dead a minute later, but anybody who says they thought she'd get out of that car is lying.The other great set-piece is when the killer is following Gail through the winding video booth.

The scenes are gripping as each one takes you on a trip through terror lane, using each important character as your tour guide for the intense adventure.Though the movie is exceedingly interesting, it is obviously not the most realistic movie. Everything revolves around killings, and key word, possible killings. Even so, Scream2 isn't so far from reality (okay, it is, but Craven did his best anyway); the outrageous parts were done to look as believable as possible.As many more people were killed in the sequel than were in the previous movie, (remember, all second flicks have twice the mayhem), which has proved that the more murdered, the merrier.

Neve seems bored, Kennedy's oddly reserved as Randy and David Arquette is back sporting a limp which he concentrates on more than his acting. Cox on the other hand is sensational. She's twice as bitchy and even colder second time round. As for the new recruits. They are as bland as the returning ones with a few exceptions.

With the return of writer Kevin Williamson, director Wes Craven, and cast members Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schrieber, you could not go wrong with this movie.  And, with the additions of the likes of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O'Connell, and Jada Pinkett, what's not to love, huh?  What's not to love?Anyway, this movie takes place after the murders of Woodsboro.  The killers, Billy and Stu, were brought to justice after killing several people in the small town.  Now, Sidney and the surviving and additional kids have gone off to college, hoping for a new start.  However, that dream quickly fades away after two of her college classmates are murdered in a movie theater (Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps).  After that, the new killers attack Billy and Stu's former targets in hope for redemption.I thought this was an excellent movie.  In Scream 3, I have heard that Wes Craven has come back once again (yes!) to direct the final chapter in the trilogy, but Kevin Williamson is not on full duty for writing the script.  For this, I should be very disappointed, but the writer taking his place is Ehren Kruger, who also wrote Arlington Road, a very very good movie.  So I don't know how this will turn out, but my expectations are very high.  Go see all of them.

Or maybe it's the fact that the first film basically came out of nowhere to impress while this one has a stylish parentage to live up to that brings about the feeling that it isn't as satisfying as it should be, but whatever it is that feeling of almost, but not quite definitely comes into play.The acting for the most part is well done, with Neve Campbell once again providing a very solid lead, ably supported by the likes of returning players Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber and new faces Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Elise Neal and Heather Graham all fun in their various roles. However it's not all acting joy as Jerry O'Connell and David Arquette both seem to sleep through their roles, while Laurie Metcalf goes a little too far over the top in her role to be totally convincing. But even so there aren't any real embarrassments performance wise here to speak of, and for the most part everyone works quite well in their respective roles.As mentioned above Wes Craven does another very classy job of directing here, and while at times Kevin Williamson's script seems to be trying a little too hard, for the most part it's well written and paced, as is the film that it's based on.Maybe I'm being too critical, as the film based on it's own merits is still a darn good watch, but I just couldn't shake that ever so slight feeling of disappointment. Still that said Scream 2 is a very enjoyable horror film, and just so long as you don't go in expecting it to be all the original was you should have a pretty good time here.One man's opinion. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Hmmm....","Date":"15 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"   The biggest mistake that Kevin Williamson ever made was to get rid of the characters that made Scream so brilliant. Neither Stu(Matt Lillard), Billy(Skeet Ulrich) nor Tatty(Rose McGowan) are in Scream 2. Sidney(Neve Campbell) and Gale(Courteney Cox) are tiresome and uninteresting. The newcomers-Timothy Olyphant, Duane Martin, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jade Pickett, Omar Epps, Rebecca Gayheart, Jerry O Connell, Elise Neal and Josh Jackson are only slightly better. So we're left with Randy(Jamie Kennedy), Dwight(Dave Arquette) and Cotton(Liev Scrieber) to light up the screen with flashes of genius and quick wit. Which thankfully, they do... The coffee house scene where Randy and Dwight try to narrow down the possible suspects is incredibly good and the scene where Randy plays the killer at his own game with a mobile phone is executed well by Kennedy and directed brilliantly by Wes Craven. The end scene where the killer/s expose themselves to sidney is done well(except the killer/s themselves don't have very big parts). In summary, Scream 2 could have been superb(like the original) but for lack of interesting characters, it is not. Saved only by 'The Boys' Kennedy, Schreiber and Arquette. Rating=3/5. P.S.It could just be my eyes playing tricks on me but does Rose McGowan appear in the pictures at the start? I'm pretty sure its her!

It`s the movie that made a breakthrough in the horror genre in the 90`s, and it`s just a shame that churned out so many mediocre clones, including it`s own sequel. I didn`t really have high expectations for Scream 2, I estimated that it would be a reasonbly good follow-up, but nothing special. After I viewed it, I was quite disappointed. Scream 2 lacks a lot of the first Scream`s virtues, including cleverness and suspense, and even though there were some traces of those qualities,( with the exception of irony, which was quite well done) it felt like they were just recycled from before. Don`t get me wrong, there a few moments that are scary, but it`s shock value doesn`t do much for the overall movie. The reunion between some of the principal characters were cheesy, and they got old very fast. None of them seemed to have the same zest as they did in the first one, not even the most eccentric ones. Also, a lot of the death scenes were very unbelievable, people get butchered in broad daylight and on public streets and still nobody seems to be around to notice.  But the worst part about Scream 2 was probably its climax, suspense was completely absent, and some parts of it were quite humourous instead of frightening. When the killers expose themselves, the movie already starts to wane, probaly because nobody knows anything about them, and frankly, no one cares either. The resolution is sketchy, and conveniently almost all of the survivors of the first Scream live on. In simple words, Scream 2 has its moments, but it`s not a worthy sequel.

This is good film, don't get me wrong, but, at times, the 'we're taking the rip out of horror films' lines, especially from Randy, wear a bit thin. The script is well written but does tend to be very similar to other films of its genre, such as 'I know what you did last summer', and its use of teen style language may appeal to some viewers, but others may find it tedious. The murder scenes are well choreographed and executed (if you don't mind the pun) and are seemingly authentic. What lets this film down is its choice of murderers. I won't let on (for anyone who hasn't seen the film) but the characters are somewhat under developed and in the case of the second killer, well, they could have placed any character in that role and the effect would have fairly similar. I cannot fault the acting, but in this film it was the unlikely character of Randy who shone. Jamie Kennedy's performance was superb; it wasn't his fault that some of his lines were shoddy.

(It wasn't.) But after a recent reviewing, I realized that this over-caffeinated sequel suffers from exactly the same reasons the first one did.1. Too much fat. i.e. Too many needless characters clogging up the screen only to provide fodder for the tired guess who the killer is routine., and so the marquee will be filled with recognizable names. I've complained for many a year about how these post-Scream films are packed with the latest teen actors who are only in this new horror market to beef up their resumes. Scream 2 in particular has an over-abundence of inneffectual appearances, meaning way too much of the overrated Sarah Michelle Gellar, and not enough of the underrated Aphrodite of the silver screen Rebecca Gayheart. (She really is cute.)2. The guessing game.  Guessing who the killer was in the first Scream worked because it was kind of unexpected. Unfortunately it's a device that can only be used once effectively. Being a cinematic technique that relies primarily on suprise, it dosen't work if the audience is expecting one of the characters to be the killer. But since everyone who went to see this knew that one of Sidney's friends was the killer, and that the climax has to be bigger than the last, the Guessing-Game concept becomes a self-defeating one when you realize that since everyone is a suspect, logically it's impossible to suprise the audience no matter who ends up being the killer.3. The hip factor.  I suppose the constant mentions of other horror movies is intended to be a form of tribute. In the first Scream that worked to a certain extent because the characters FELL PREY to the cliches that they were making fun of. In this movie however, these references seem more like name-dropping. Here the characters argue (in a classroom scene so self-consciously forced it makes me cringe every time I see it) about whether sequels are lame. In the end, it's the MOVIE ITSELF that falls pray to this argument, not the characters. Scream 2 doesn't just nudge, but practically SHOVES the viewer in a desperate attempt to show how clever it's being, almost giving it the attitude that it's above its subject matter.Still, in spite of my rambling, this isn't a failiure. Neve Campbell is intelligent enough to make for a great heroine. You always want her to survive. That's the primary factor in this series' success. Also, there's a great opening sequence in a movie theatre that seems similar to the inspired chaos of Italian filmmaker Dario Argento.Not bad, but I have a feeling this film, and any others in this series will eventually suffer the same fate of the sequels of other horror franchises The Howling and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in that they will just be forgotten.

What made the original so strong was not so much the shocking nature of the murders but the randomness and unexpectedness of them, and more than anything the guessing game of whodunnit which very few people will have cracked. Scream 2, however, is nowhere near as clever, the murderers turn out to be coincidential characters who never would have been suspected and the final scene which could have been memorable turns into a bit of a farce. In terms of jumpiness, gore and beatiful women, Scream 2 rocks but otherwise it is a bit of a disappointment.

In this film, a series of copycat murders are happening around Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the new killer starts coming after her and the other Woodsboro survivors. One thing I missed while watching this was the occasional laugh from the first one. This one had a couple of good lines, but Scream was definitely funnier, making fun of its own kind of movie. The funniest part in either film still remains as the moment in Scream when the killer is coming up behind Randy (JAMIE Kennedy) as he watches Halloween and says Jamie, look behind you! (referring to Jamie Lee Curtis). The acting in this film is not quite as good as it was in the original, but wasn't bad. Dewey (David Arquette) had a couple of moments of overdoing it, but not too many. The main problem with the film was the 'who's the killer' mystery.  There are more suspects to deal with, and the filmmakers seemed worried that if the killer's character is developed too much before revealing that they are the killer, then people will figure it out prematurely. As a result, when the killer is revealed, perhaps you didn't see it coming, but you aren't really shocked that this person could be a killer because you don't really know much of anything about them. One thing you start to learn during the movie is that just because someone was involved in the first ordeal, it doesn't mean that they aren't a possible suspect now, nor does it necessarily mean they aren't a potential victim.  Depending on how suspicious you are of people, there are countless numbers of suspects in the film, and to a really on-guard person, just about anyone in the movie is a suspect, which makes it really hard to identify the killer.  There was one thing I didn't like about the movie, and one character was murdered who I still think should have survived. I really can't see from here how they are planning to make Scream 3 after this film seemed to burn the bridge to another sequel. It isn't necessary, seeing as how the same characters (mainly Sidney) have gone through the same type of ordeal twice, which is just on the edge of plausibility.  Maybe it's just so they can call it a trilogy, but it really wouldn't be, because there really is a difference between a trilogy and a film with two sequels. In general, one sequel is enough and maybe pushing it, and a second sequel is almost always too far.  Scream 2 is still scary, and may even be as scary as the first, although the opening scene of Scream is still the scariest of it all. This sequel doesn't make the same mistake many sequels to good films make, which is abandoning suspense altogether when it is too busy going all out with what it may have held back on in the first film, which in this case would have been as much gruesome death as possible. While it does have this extra gore (obviously it's going to -- this is a horror movie, after all) it still manages to have the same suspense that made the first one terrifying. If you loved the first film, you'll probably like this one too. This is still a good movie, but the first one, as always, was the best.

Many of his films are extremely inventive, but they have failed in many ways- do to unbalanced dialogue and acting. In my opinion Craven's films were neither suspenseful or horrifying, except for how bad they were. I had made up my mine that Wes Craven was a very over-rated horror director, producing more 'bombs' than 'five-stars'. However, I viewed SCREAM and was surprised at how the inventive camera angles and creative script had made me tense throughtout the entire film. Even more so in SCREAM 2, which is a film that changed my viewpoint on the director. Studying the film many times, I have come to understand many of the human emotions that Wes Craven has incorporated into it. Horror movies must be more than just blood and gore to make it scary, you need the human emotion. If you can't feel or relate to a character, who cares if they die? In SCREAM 2, you do feel for and relate to the characters and are horrifed (hopefully- or problems may be setting in!) when they get killed off. Unlike the opening scene of the first SCREAM, nothing in this movie was as disturbing, which made it more entertaining. There are many scenes in SCREAM 2 which are bound to become classic and imitated time and time again. The camera angles are well done, the acting is definitely convincing, and the music is tense. If you appreciate these qualities in a horror film, then you will enjoy SCREAM 2, and understand why it is (in my opinion) Wes Craven's most mature film and has truly established him as the master of his craft.

The villains are just not as effective as the first Scream. We don't know them, we can't identify with them and as much as they try to ooze suspense and horror, they're not frightening enough. But that's just what I think...

People may say Kevin Williamson has revitalized the whole dead teen genre, but he is completely playing it out. First of all, I liked the original SCREAM, but I think there is definitely no need for a sequel or dare I say, trilogy.  What's the point of having a trilogy that parodies slasher movies if it doesn't really do justice? SCREAM 2 has all sorts of movie references to movies like NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, HOUSE 2 THE SECOND STORY and FRIDAY THE 13th, but does the movie itself parody the horror genre well? No it doesn't.  There's a whole scene in which a group of film students talk about sequels that surpassed their originals, like THE GODFATHER 2, ALIENS, and T2,but they don't even explain why they were better. The whole movie itself is a dumb suspense movie with no suspense and predictable.  The scares in this movie are all cheap and predictable.  The killer doesn't do anything but stab, and the victims just bleed out of their mouths, for the blood is the only colorful thing coming out of their mouths.  And writers like Kevin Smith write their movie references and dialogue so well, with wit and insight, but Kevin Williamson thinks he can create laughs just by mentioning the name Freddy Krueger? Where's the wit in that?  And if they're going to parody and say references to killers such as Freddy, Jason, or Candyman, why isn't there a killer in this movie along those lines?  The killers in this movie are nothing but normal people with slight chemical imbalances, Whats the fun in that?

Some time after the murders in Scream, a film has been made to much fame. A killer begins his spree by attacking two movie goers. Sidney and Randy, fellow students of the victims at Windsor College, attend a press conference that addresses the murders. Dewey arrives on campus to protect her, and Gale arrives with Cotton in the attempt to bring the two together for an interview. Both Dewey and Gale suspect the return of a killer and begin making inquiries into it. The killer continues to stalk the community, attacking a sorority, and makes threatening phone calls, but Sidney's boyfriend, Derek, helps to protect her. Dewey and Gale make progress in their investigation. Two detectives are assigned to protect Sidney. Eventually Randy is murdered, then the two detectives, and then Hallie. In the climax, Derek is murdered, the killer is revealed to be Mickey who worked with Debbie Salt. Gale, Sidney, and Dewey all survive. There are several topics address in the film through dialog. The first is the lack of an African-American influence in horror films. The heyday of slasher films was in the 80s while Whites still had a very large strong hold. Whether or not they still do is another topic, but the slasher genre was always more concerned about gore and ticket sales; it appealed to a mass ticket going audience. The second topic is the conversation in film class about sequels. It has to be one of the best dialogs in cinema. Film often takes a second seat to fine art like statues and paintings. Jaime Kennedy and Timothy Olyphant bring up topics of pop culture, like T2 and Godfather, that help the audience relate and be less cynical about the fact that this is simply another sequel to a slasher movie. A third topic is the influence of culture on violence. It's a theme very common, as they point out. Bob Dole hit on this heavily and ran for President in '96 the year before Scream 2 came out. These themes are what make Scream 2 better than most horror movies. They have actual themes and topics other than just killing. It's hard to take seriously a mass murdering a movie as very legitimate, so these validate the film and the many emotions that come with it. I'd definitely recommend this film.

Wes Craven knew what he wanted to do and screenwriter Kevin Williamson knew how to be good with references without going too overboard. Nowadays this concept is beyond overused and is now becoming a tiresome and dreary old form of comedy/horror. Only Scream could accomplish it correctly.Scream 2 is relatively the same thing as it's predecessor. Only now the lead characters have all seen a film called Stab which is the movie version of the murders they were involved with. Sort of like Scream is a movie about itself. Following? Well, same formula here. The characters know every horror movie cliché and instead of making the usual mistakes, they come up with ways to do their own mistakes.I like the cast a lot more in the sequel. We get Jerry O'Connell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Timothy Olyphant, Omar, Epps, and even Marisol Nichols has a brief cameo. The cast is perfect. A great addition to a worthy sequel. Normally I don't like sequels more than the originals. But Scream 2 manages to accomplish a bit more than the first.The question at this point is how much more steam does the Scream series have? We have a third film that came out in 2000, and a fourth film in the series, released in 2011. Is Scream going to run itself down? Or will prove worthy of so many sequels and show that you can't ever scream too much? Starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy, Jerry O'Connell, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, Liev Schreiber, Rebecca Gayheart, and Marisol Nichols.

Director Craven and screenwriter Williamson are back for a second round. And this time, it's with good intentions. Necessary? I perhaps not, but effective? Certainly. The body count's increasing, and the games are back and better than ever.What separates Scream 2 from the other lackluster sequels is how true it stays to its source material, while bringing something new to the table. In my opinion, while Scream was unpredictable, this film is definitely more surprising in terms of the whodunit premise. There are tons of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.Not to mention the performances are still strong. The characters have matured and are evolving in their roles, which is always welcome. The script... what can I say? The one liners pack the same hard punch, and the lines are delivered greatly. As for the suspense, there's definitely more where that came from. Scream 2 doesn't skimp on the goods.Also, remember the iconic 12-minute opening in Scream. Yeah well, Scream 2's is just as great. Without spoiling too much, the setting's at a movie theatre, and boy does it not disappoint.Anything else? While this is one neat production, I thought the film was bloodier, but not gorier. Scream, in terms of deaths, is stronger, whereas Scream 2 consists of mostly just stabs and ounces of that red stuff. Scream 2 is another home run for Craven. The film might closely resemblance Scream (maybe a little TOO closely), but it offers just a little something special for the beloved fans. Scream 2 is as good, if not, better than its predecessor.

I thought the film was good because at the beginning 2 people are watching Stab(a film based on Woodsboro murders)when the real killer, instead of fake ones in the theater, murders them and calmly leaves blaming lots of innocent people who didn't know that the killer was in the same room as they are in. But now Sydney is in college and loving it. And is trying to get over the murders from the previous film and lives nearby Dewey's home with a big security system. I personally thought that when Ghost-face had them in the police car I thought that he would crash the car resulting in everyone inside dying suddenly upon impact. But I was scared to death when Sydney was making her way out of the car window(as in the front driver's window the only exit). I was holding my breath when she crawled out and stared down the killer who was temporarily knocked unconscious. For at least five minutes or so. Until he gets out mysteriously and kills Sydney's friend right in front of her. I was scared to death when Cotton was deciding whether or not to kill Sydney or let her live. I was like let her live please, the mother is crazy, kill her, not her! I was holding my breath when he had finally decided to let her live and kill the mom instead. Because he had forgiven her and thought that she had deserved to live instead of the crazy mom breathing down her neck.

There are real moments of terror in the story, which finds Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) once again dealing with a psycho slasher in a ghost mask who is stalking her and her close friends in a pleasant Ohio college town. Courteney Cox reprises her role as reporter Gale Weathers, who turned out to be an unexpected hero in Scream and returns to gain more fame, capitalizing on the murders taking place at Sidney's school. David Arquette also returns as the funny Deputy Dewey and his scenes with Gale are some of the best comic moments in the film. The cast is better in this sequel, and besides the main trio of Campbell, Cox and Arquette, Jamie Kennedy returns as movie buff Randy, and you've also got appearances by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jerry O'Connell, and even the always delightful Laurie Metcalfe (of Roseanne fame) in a hilarious cameo role as an aspiring reporter.Where the film is overlong, it proves itself to be an ultimately entertaining and clever retread of the first. Scream 2 still takes the time to establish its characters and environment before people start getting picked off by the killer. Wes Craven has an eye for scary chase scenes and these are the highlight of the film. Among these are a jolting car chase, a clever revamp of the opening from the first film set in a sorority house, and even a surprise moment of horror in a crowded movie theater at the premiere of Stab, ironically, a film within a film gimmick based on the events of the first film. It's touches like this that keep Scream 2 above routine slasher material, but not for long. The twist (that is to say, who Ghostface actually turned out to be) was genuinely unexpected, even more so than the first, and echoes some classic twists from earlier films in the genre that inspired Scream itself. Craven is still at the top of his game stylistically but it doesn't get much better than the original Scream. "},{"Title":"Part 2 Continues to WOW","Date":"23 August 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" The Scream Trilogy is the film series that redefined fear. They revived the horror genre. The one Alfred Hitchcock sunned everyone with Psycho. The one John Carpenter's Halloween brought serial killers afloat to. Even our own Wes Craven did by scaring us in the only place we found comfort in with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Now, with the Scream trilogy, the horror genre was brought back to life continuing the face of iconic fear. Wes Craven, as mentioned before, is the master of suspense. When Kevin Williamson's script was out on the prow, Craven was really the only proper choice to direct. His method of scaring the audience never fails. He has so much control over the three stories without the feeling of over-directing. For many years, Freddy Kruger was hailed as Craven's masterpiece, this trilogy is now and will be his crowning achievement. Kevin Williamson wrote the original and the sequel, then Ehren Kruger came along to write the third when Williamson declined. However, Williamson basically outlined the story for Kruger, leaving the dialogue and details to Kruger. All three scripts are absolutely incredible and tantalizing original. The story grows as the series continues and it becomes more intricate. Now, it'd be tough to choose between the three, which is my favorite. But, I think as the story becomes more complicated, I was more intrigued, which may be the only factor to say the films get better as we go along. That aside, the three are so close together with quality, entertainment, suspense, and as films overall. It's difficult for a film trilogy to achieve that. Most times, sequels get worse, but here? No such thing.The thing that really separates Scream from the average film series besides the screenplay, the direction, the suspense level, the tech stuff, and the visuals is the acting. This is what I call true acting ensemble. The two dazzlingly standouts are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. What performances. Now, it's no surprise that Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are in all three films. So Campbell and Cox have to sustain their performances over three films. It's extraordinary. David Arquette, I'll check him off first. He is funny and dorky in the first two films. He really adds to the table in Scream 3. He finally grows up and isn't as insecure, which is a lovely thing to see.You see the actors grow and fall as their characters. Campbell really finds Sidney Prescott, the true essence of the character. Campbell does something tricky here. She shows us a girl who is in a horrible place in her life, who is strong and can make it in the world, but is also vulnerable and weak. It's tricky, but she pulls it off with grace. Sidney is this tormented young woman, and Campbell never shies away from that; how she can act with her eyes can simply not be put into words, it's that great. Courteney Cox is fierce as Gale Weathers. She leaves her comfy zone (the control freak Monica Geller on Friends). Cox steps up the dramatic work here, especially in Scream 2. The character Gale Weathers grows from being a wannabe b*tch, to being a successful and rub it in your face more of a b*tch. Then in Scream 3, she changes. After her true feelings for Dewey were revealed in Scream 2, Gale was tamed and not so much of the witch she once was. I've mentioned her dramatic work in Scream 2 a few times. It is simply the best of her career. In Scream 1, she was hinting that she had feelings for Dewey, but also hinting she was using him for information. In Scream 2, she finally lets lose and says 'I don't care, and gives in. Right as she confesses herself, the situation diminishes. Cox is so good in the scene where she is the sound room and sees Dewey being stabbed through the mirrors (to what she thought was his death). It's heartbreaking. In Scream 2, Jada Pinkette is hilarious, without a funny character. Her section of the film is awesome and a great follow-up to Barrymore's from the original film. Sarah Michelle Gellar also has a small role here and makes the most of her seven-minute screen time. Laurie McCalf is also very good here. Jamie Kennedy, who survived the first film reprises his role here and it's always a fun time when he's on the screen.The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too. The ghostface costume has become the most frightening, iconic horror film costume. It screams fear. The brilliance of it is, this mask wasn't made specifically for the film. I was a regular Halloween costume sold in stores everywhere. That's what makes it scarier. The great master, Wes Craven once said, Something isn't scary unless people can identify with it and could possibly be in the same positions as the characters on the screen. The films also include a killer score and frightening sets (especially John Milton's house, where the climax of Scream 3 takes place).Bob Weinstein, the producers of the Scream trilogy, now demanded a fourth installment. Why? To make a few bucks? Scream fits perfectly as a trilogy, without any loose ends and had a wonderful ending filled with metaphors and a great chase scene. Williamson is back writing. Having him back on board with Craven directing and three survivors back gives me some comfort that it won't fail completely, but I'm scared for it's survival. Let's just hope for the best. Overall, without a doubt, the best trilogy ever made. My personal favorite films; they're fun, very scary, with excellent performances, writing and directing. What more could you want? The three easiest 10s I've ever given.

NO one was really expecting this to be better than the original, ( most sequels SUCK ) but this was a much anticipated movie and hit hard hwen it came out. This very closely came to surpassing the original. Sydney still believes that there is a killer waiting to get her, and she's right, with a movie about her life coming out, more muders start to occur. And she soon again finds herself in the middle of vicious murders. And she finds out that it is again a tag team duo, Micky, the freaky film student, and Billy's mother, who also, like her son, seeks good old fashion revenge.... What made this movie so populare was that it took Scream to a new level, bringing in other stars, and having movies inside a movie, and it mixed comedy with horror. Tastefuly, in one of hte first secens, we meet a college class discussing how sequels suck. This all thrown into one makes for a fun movie that is packed with it's share of thrills. I liked the sequel it was better than most sequels turn out however I still prefer the first but it was satisfactory to my demands. The premise of the sequel is that the survivors of the first movie all go on to college as well as three new members to the group and after the movie Stab based on what had happened to them last year came out two people were murdered and they think that they could be next so they are now wondering if it is a person trying to make a real life sequel. I would recommend this to people who have for one thing seen the first movie and liked it. Also if you are going to watch this make sure that you are thirteen or older otherwise it will be to violent for you. Second of all my advice would be for you to watch it with a friend otherwise you may be afraid to pick up the phone if they call.

But a gruesome murder spree at a local cinema at a screening of 'Stab' soon has suspicions raised as once more the Ghost mask is present.This now infamous murderer starts handpicking victims one by one and the way this story is told, there is no apparent reason and pattern to these killings, which generates a wonderful sense of mystery. In a sense this sequel is like a good crime novel. An obvious target, a couple of red herrings, gruesome murders and a gasping realization come the final part. In a way it's a shame to find out the identity of said killer as the mystery and unfathomable story is so well told you almost don't want to know. Sadly however every film has an end and with this comes a shocking realization and exciting final battle.Neve Campbell once more excels as the lead, being quietly aggressive and opinionated without being too squeamish in her paranoia. David Arquette receives a more inquisitive role in this sequel which takes into account his more vulnerable personality as Dewy with Courtney Cox as great and present as the annoying reporter.Wes Craven's approach to this sequel is, as Randy so eloquently puts it, have more deaths which are more elaborate and gory as the film's predecessor. Initially this statement seems to be tried and tested trivia but when the film gets into the latter stages we see the point as the deaths get hotter and heavier as the pace rounds to tension.With Scream the surprise and shock of the murderer kept the tempo at razor edge as clues and hints mislead us right until the jaw dropping finale, not to forget that there were a few jumpy moments in and amongst the gripping chases. With this sequel there are very few jump scenes and the conceptual genre of horror is left purely down to the gruesome killings. In a sense this is a more adept movie concentrating on the story rather than going for full out jumps. Whether you like jumping behind the sofa or be engaged physiologically remains irrelevant once the pace starts. There are nervous scenes but this doesn't generate the fear factor you may want from a horror film.Is this better than the original? No, purely because the first hit was so surprising and had the jumps and the tension, it made a complete horror. Do not be discouraged as where this may lack the freak-out factor; it is fast and highly enjoyable.

Re-uniting Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, the film also saw the return of its surviving stars as well as the now-iconic Ghostface killer, who, for obvious reasons, carries an alternate identity than that of the killer(s) in the first film. Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see Scream rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, Scream 2 is to horror sequels what Scream was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from Roseanne herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role.

Blatantly attempting to resurrect the glory imposed on the first outing, it manages to remain immensely predictable for the majority before hitting you with an exquisite twist at the end.Two years later and Sidney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) life appears to be back on track. Happily settled at college, she still gets the occasional prank call, but will happily laugh it off thanks to caller ID. Yes, with a new 'perfect' boyfriend and life sorted, for Sidney life can only go wrong. So let's not be surprised when suddenly a copycat killer begins to replicate the events of the past.Yet again the amazing Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson present us with the life of Sidney Prescott. With bad acting and some weak lines, you do know what your going to get with these films, and in regards to blood, you are rarely surprised. Ultimately though, the film is lacking. Less intellectual than it's predecessor, you only begin to grasp the genius at work when the eccentric film buffs class is taking place and every man and his dog pokes fun at the regularly inferior 'sequel'. This in itself is a brilliant masterstroke by writer Williamson who is blatantly aware of how this film will fail to live up to the original. Williamson is in fact so definite on this fact, that he abandons the intelligence soon after this early scene and resorts to jokes about the cast ('Friends' jokes for Courtney Cox, references to the cast of the film 'Stab' which is being made as a tribute to the original film) and the surprise twist at the end. Aside from these though, Williamson's input is limited and lacking in comparison with what he achieve in the first film.The other problem of course is the same reason why so many sequels fail to live up to their predecessor, mainly that they are not original. 'Scream' changed horror and it did it in a fresh and keen way. In contrast 'Scream 2' is just another entry into the curriculum vitae of the cast and nothing new. Yes the plot is new and yes we do have new characters, but the feelings you get from watching a ground breaking film are absent. The film in effect, is like the first film but without the relevance.'Scream 2' is not a bad film to watch. Often entertaining, albeit in a predictable way, it does provide a few key moments. That's all that can really be said about it however. Once again the acting is weak, and once again you don't care because most of the characters will die. The film is basically a repeat of it's predecessor but without the charm, intelligence and original feel. Watch it and be amused, but don't expect too much. Your average teenage horror story.

She now races to save her friends before the killer finds them and kills them.The Good News Truly original sequel in the trilogy that never really got the due credits it deserved. Personally, it's my favorite in the trilogy and I think it's better than the first one. The original was great, but part 2 has a certain charm that the first one didn't. The all-star cast isn't it, but I just enjoy watching this one. The gore is slightly toned down, but I don't mind that. It fit the tone of the film. The real reason why I enjoy this one is that the comedy is completely gone to the point of it being not even relevant to the film. As a hard-core horror film fan, I really hated that part about 'Scream' where it took itself too mockingly. It was a film that was being resentful of horror movies while being a horror movie, while maybe being the creative spark that re-ignited horror films, I thought was something that I thought never should've come from Wes Craven, who's made many of the films in my top 20. It was a breath of fresh air for this series, even after the mediocre part 3. The one other good thing for part 2 that the others didn't have was real suspense. Who couldn't forget the nerve-wrecking escape from the cop car? The other cool scene is the school dance, where Sid learns that she is dancing with the killer among a group of similar masked dancers. It could've been played out longer, but it was still really creepy. The other good part of this movie is that I noticed Craven going back to his roots with the movie, showing roving cameras and claustrophobic sets that remind viewers of his earlier masterpieces. The ending is a great example of this. A ten-minute sequence revolving around one place and time that kept you riveted to your seat and tied up loose ends at the same time is a great example of Craven at his best.The Bad News The killer(s) motive is rather hackneyed and almost unbelievable. Wanting to blame the killings for being inspired by the recent horror film that was itself inspired by the events in the first movie was almost nonsensical and completely moronic. Craven has always been a master of incorporating a great and original premise in his movies, even in his clunker movies. It has been a real trademark in his films, and here he really misses the mark. I know he wanted to compliment on the recent, or at the time recent, controversies involving the violence in horror movies, but it is really tacked on and almost an afterthought. It should've been reworked into a more believable reason for the killer(s). The Final Verdict This is one of the rare horror film sequels that nearly surpasses the original in popularity, but it deserves to be seen. It is really creepy, the body count is pretty big, and it keeps you riveted, as you never do guess the killer(s) in the film. It is highly recommended to slasher fans and to those who have been turned off of horror because of 'Scream's' success at lampooning their favorite genre.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language  "},{"Title":"Just wanted to give a nice, little review, that's all","Date":"24 October 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  NOT! I am here to trash all over Scream 2 and the myriad of movies just like it. (Please note that Scream part one is still a good movie if you can try to forget the awfulness of sequels like this and tons of rip-offs, and their sequels, too!) Alright, first of all The writing was pretty stale by this entry because Scream part one was so big that within a year or so this self-referentiality stuff was already devoid of its once clever flair. (And, just to make the fact known, there were many self-referential horror movies done before Scream, meaning Wes Craven really did nothing new.) Next The one really fun character left from part one was Jamie Kennedy's character, the video geek that all of us horror-obsessed video geeks could relate to. He gets offed halfway through the movie after making one of the only clever jokes in this entire mess. I'm sure Craven did this to be unpredictable and shock audiences by depicting the death of a character they cared about. Why didn't that stuck-up, capitalist-with-a-heart-of-gold character of Courtney Cox's get offed? I guess Craven couldn't please everybody, but it was a pretty bad idea no matter how many critics said he was being hip and smart. Reason number three comin' up The ending was not a stunning surprise like in the first film. It seemed almost as if Craven tacked on some lackluster footage at the last minute (which is pretty believable when you consider the fact that he wrote a few different endings to this). Yes, this is just another Friday the 13th sequel, except without the gore and sleazy nudity that kept those films from being totally dull. So the next time someone who praises crap like this out the wazoo is about to trash on a much better low-budget film, remember that the budget is not what makes a movie good.

Reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is also back. Seems she's written a book about Sydney and her life, and it's been turned into a movie called Stab! At the premiere of Stab! a couple of people are killed, and everyone thinks its all starting over again. To the aid of young Sydney comes Dewey (David Arquette) who has seen better days. Soon people all over campus are being killed by someone in a Scream mask. Who is it this time? Everyone's a suspect, and everyone seems to have a motive.   The only real difference between Scream 2 and the original is now you're sort of ready for the twists and turns. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson still serve up horror clichés, then shoot them down, but it's not as unexpected as before. But that doesn't mean the movie isn't as fun as the first. You still can't guess who the killer is until they decide to tell you (although I was a little disappointed in the ending). And the movie does slow down a little in the middle. Just before sitting down to watch Scream 2 I watched a copy of the original that had Craven and Williamson talking about the movie as it was happening. They mentioned that one of the producers told them they needed to kill someone off in the middle (turned out to be the principal) because you couldn't have a horror film where no one died for half an hour, and I wish they had done something like that here. The movie is still filled with pop-culture references (how many movies can mention Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and the fact that The Empire Strikes back wasn't a sequel but a continuation of a trilogy?)The main reason the original was fun was because it didn't assume that the audience is stupid, and just want a lot of blood and guts. Williamson knows that today's horror fans are more sophisticated, and expect a movie that makes sense. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and probably will go see it again.

Is Scream 2 one of them? Definitely not. The first Scream film worked well because it played with the rules of the slasherflick (although it is far less original in this than you might think, as Wes Craven's own New Nightmare did pretty much the same thing) without subverting them and because it brought a much needed energy back into the genre. I don't think Scream is a true horror classic (I didn't think it was very scary), but it's still great fun. Scream 2 aimes for pretty much the same thing. It's another postmodern slasher where the characters know the rules of the genre and where the filmmakers play around with them.Sometimes, it still works. The whole sequel-discussion will please anyone with a casual interest in film, the cameos by Heather Graham and Tori Spelling (as Neve Campbell's character in the movie-within-the-movie based on the events in Scream) are cleverly inserted into the film and there's even a hint the filmmakers are trying to confound the audience' expectations (one slashing is an example in particular). It's not as though Kevin Williamson's film-literate script is a complete waste of time. But apart from these clever flourishes, there's very little here. Sure, he throws in 'subtexts' like the media's obsession with violence and, more notably and bravely, the whole relationship between violence in media (and film in particular) and in real-life. But as it doesn't do a lot with its subtexts, so what you're left with is your usual barrage of killings and a whodunnit storyline. And a lot of it isn't nearly as sharp as Scream. The dialogue has its moments, but the character interplay is as shallow as possible and there's an awful scene where Neve Campbell has to dodge a real knife among fake ones in a stage play. It's the type of hugely theatrical scene that doesn't work at all in this type of film. Apart from that, the conclusion to the whole whodunnit isn't nearly as satisfying as Scream's.What makes it worse is the rushed execution. Wes Craven is a gifted horror director and not a gifted stylist and Scream 2 brings out the worst in him. The entire film is shot in a dull, predictable fashion and at times it almost looks (cinematographically, anyway) random. Worse even is the handling of the typical horror film staples. The shocks are telegraphed early but don't work because of clumsy editing (the first 'shock' is a case in point). The gore level is very low (actually, apart from the sound effects there is nearly no real gore) and it doesn't have any atmosphere. Craven is talented, but here he's clearly rushed his work in order to release before the genre dies again.And that's the whole film's problem, it feels too rushed. Which is also noticeable in the music, where they use part of the Broken Arrow soundtrack as Dewey's theme (or is this a VERY misguided popculture reference?). I really think with (a lot) more polishing Scream 2 could have a competent, enjoyable romp, but as is, it's only occasionally entertaining.Rating 5/10 "},{"Title":"Don't Watch w/o Seeing Scream First","Date":"11 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":"  Scream reinvigorated the slasher movie, a narrow genre to begin with, and one that I thought exhausted.  It's sequel, Scream 2 is very similar to its predecessor in substance and style. Strong character development, clever dialogue, large dollops of humor, and of course lots of scares marks this as way above average. Unfortunately, Scream 2 has two significant difficulties for viewers. One is that it's almost a mirror image of Scream. Instead of high school, it's set at a college, but the characters, and set-ups are almost identical. You don't have to see both movies, one is enough. The second problem is that if you haven't seen Scream, Scream 2 won't make a lot of sense. The plot follows the survivors of Scream to college, where, of course, the carnage begins anew. There are tons of backwards references that don't stand-alone very well, and as for the who-dunnit aspects of the movie's conclusion, knowledge of the original Scream is an absolute necessity.  Therefore, only rent Scream 2 if you've also seen Scream and want more of the same. It's exactly what you'll get.

This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).

Also don't change a good formula!!!! (this goes out to them suckers who want to make Scream 4 without the original cast (or even dare to think about it)). If you want to do it do it with them or NOT and if you do, please Neve, Courteney, David and Wes only when the script is great, no ONLY when it RULES and do not do it for money when your career is in a dip like van Damme did with Universal Sodier 2. I mean look at lousy horror sequels Hellraiser 2 and 4, Chucky 3, Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and A new Nightmare (sorry Wes).This is I must admit not the second time I watched this one, for I was preparing to see Scream 3 really soon afterwards, so I wanted to see Scream 1 and Scream 2 before, so I could get back in to everything that happened. I already knew, of course, who the killer was and this review (as to the whodunnit) looks at the film as if I first saw it.Another good thing here is that all the cast looks grown up, I mean between Scream and Scream 2 there is only one year, but you feel as if many years have gone by (just as the story suggests). This is especially extreme with Neve Campbell, who in Scream looked like 15 or 16 and here looks like 19 or so. I must also say, that the new looks of Campbell and Courteney Cox are much better (they look good, with those clothes and different hair, yummy!!!!). There are yet some other pretty ladies running about, what about that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sid's on screen friend played by Elise Neil. Of course you can see also Portia DeRossi also, who is if I may say is pretty too (normally), but here is just a non - ugly (along with all her sorority sisters) female. I must say though she plays one genuine bleached blonde bim.. (you fill out the rest) here. Also there was of course the shagadelic Heather Graham, who played in the movie &#145;Stab' but who had a real bad wig there in the movie within the movie.

For the psycho killer(s) I must say he/she/they was/were great, you really believed he/she /they were totally flipped and you bought it. Neve Campbell really has grown in acting and is yet much more believable and so are David Arquette and Courteney Cox, whose characters are deepened out.NOW I want to spend a few lines on the great Neve Campbell, I thought she will be great (as in a successful actress) when I saw The Craft, Scream, Scream 2, but I must revise this now, she chooses to stay and make low budget films, that are not so heavily supported by the studios and so tend to make little money. But I must say that it is a good choice as long as the movies are as good as Wild Things or Simba's Pride.The best thing here though is the direction, Wes Craven made this one much more theatrical than the first one, and there are two scenes I LUV especially, the opening scene and the rehearsal scene. They are great and combine effects, music and events perfectly. Also there are some great spoofs.  Now I bet you wonder why this does not get a 10, I presume, well I felt that some things should not have been done in the film, like that scene when Cox and Arquette go see some footage. Also I didn't like the new camera dude that much, played by Duane Martin, for I thought his &#145;frightened' character was too overdone. Also I found the ending not very good, it was mere average. The end of Scream was much and much better, so it come that this film does not get a 10.Still rent, watch and enjoy8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Very bad sequel","Date":"6 August 2000","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" Craven used to be known to make REAL horror movies. Sometimes they were experimentation horror films. But now he has fallen for Hollywood's love of cheap scares and loud, loud, loud soundtracks. This film only has one musical cue that isn't criminally loud noise. But it's music stolen from Hans Zimmer's Broken Arrow soundtrack. A soundtrack I love. This kind of made me annoyed the first, and only, time I saw this (well over 2 years ago).The photography in this film is the worst I have ever seen. Almost everything that isn't in the immediate foreground is blurred and out-of-focus. Horror films offer so many opportunities for creativity in all areas of film production. But as this film is made to appeal to mass audiences the style has to be simple. Even terrible. There is nothing worthwhile about this film and nothing to recommend. The part that I hate most seems to be what most people (for some reason) like the best. A class full of film students discusses if sequels are better than originals. That's it. You see&#133;this IS a sequel, and they talk about sequels. Wow! So what?! That's the irony! And it's not worth a penny. I have never seen a more simpleminded and superficial so-called 'horror' film as bad as this. The fact that it thinks it's so cool just makes it worse. The true horror of this film is the horrifying ignorance to the audience. Watch Urban Legend instead if you want to watch a Campus 'who's the killer?' flick. It's junk but it's better than this.

Another thing that caused me to suspect him was that he was one of only a couple new male characters. In slasher films it's mostly male killers. He also didn't even really have any scenes where he was with the group members. I also knew it couldn't of been any of the survivors because hey why would they want to hurt Sidney?

Added to the mix is an eclectic group of familiar young actors (Jerry O'Connell, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Duane Martin, etc.!). I think this is part of the problem as the film is an uneasy mix of the main actors from 1 along with all these new faces in 2. There's too much exposition as half of Scream 2 spends time referring back to 1.There seems to be too much going on in Scream 2 and most of it is pretty boring. The dialogue and scenes leading up to the big kill moments have no wit, bite or humor like in the first movie. Characters pop in and out of nowhere adding nothing to the proceedings.

This time the film pokes fun at the slasher sequels where the twists and turns are more absurd and silly and with more deathcounts. The team does a successful job and just like in the first movie the element of suspense and humour is fused together very well. The new cast includes Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber (who did have a smaller role in the first movie), Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olifant, Laurie Metcalf, Marisol Nichols, Portia de Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart and they contribute well. The latter two are particularly hilarious as they parody sorority sluts. Now I won't reveal which ones get butchered and which ones survive for that is best left to the viewer but Craven and his team have succeeded yet again in parodying the subgenre. Some may argue that it is less clever compared to the first but that's the point because sequels usually are sillier than their predecessors and the final revelation here is hilarious. On the technical side, music is effectively used and the camera-work does its trick. The sets are also quite impressive, particularly in the theatre scene.

The final conclusion to this movie is even more stupid as the ending of the first part and somewhat lacks of originality. That means that you still have to switch your brain off and look over details concerning annoying characters, horrible dialogues or lacks of originality in the script.Overall, this movie has still more suspense than the first part, concentrates on better actors and has a higher degree of dark atmosphere. It's a gripping flick that concentrates as much on the entertaining and humorous side of the movie as on the mystery and horror factor.

Having Sid at college is a great settling for a slasher film, it has creepy corridors, college parties, loads of suspects and much more elements that could be used, but the film doesn't seem to utilises them well enough.The film didn't have the same sort of scares that the first film included, the scare scenes in this film just don't feel as they did in the first. The movie also fails on doing what made the first film so brilliant which was the nod to previous slashers and horror movies, it became less of a parody and more of the many films the original Scream was poking fun at. However saying all this the film still has its up sides, there are some great scenes within the film and some of them are quite remember able. I personally felt that in some of the cool scenes there is much room for improvement and that they could of done so much with them. It does have its moments and there is one scene that is sort of moving in its own way but not much more then that. Scream 2 is good if your looking to put something on with a couple of mates thats fun and has its jumpy moments as well but thats all it is while the first one was fun to watch with friends but was really cleaver.

It only stood to reason they would rush to make a sequel a year later. The amazing part is that Scream 2, in most people's opinions easily sits on the plateau of the original and in some ways even exceeds the original film. The story is stronger, the cast is thoroughly established, and they are in a whole new setting ripe for the Ghostface killer. The film makers are incredibly smart because they stuck to the 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' method by keeping everything that made the original Scream successful and top notch. Best of all they took the incredibly clever satire that made the first one a huge success and turned up the intelligent and fun horror spoofing. The two films together make probably one of the best slasher flicks in the nineties easily. If anything director Wes Craven knew exactly how to keep the success rolling and that makes anyone who loves horror smile because it means you will be ferociously entertained and blown away by something that is smarter and truly a pop culture revolution.The entire original main cast come back stronger than ever. Neve Campbell, Liev Schreiber (really terrific and his character is even better), Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Jamie Kennedy all come back and are truly better than they were the first time around. Their characters are more developed, we know their background and what they've been through and their older and in a new place in their lives. Schreiber and Kennedy are both better than they were the first time around and more main character. As in the first film Scream 2 gives us a host of hot young newcomers and Hollywood 'It' kids including Jada Pinkett Smith (classic beginning horror scene that she is great in), Omar Epps (same for him), Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joshua Jackson, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, and Portia de Rossi. Also new to the cast is Sydney's (Campbell) new boyfriend Jerry O'Connell who is really great as one of the male heroes in the film. Him and Campbell have great chemistry as well.There is no question that Wes Craven is a horror master but Scream proved his direction was timeless. He returns to helm the perfect (and superior) sequel and Kevin Williamson returns to pen the script. The setting of the college campus and sorority house would seem to be terribly predictable and yet Scream 2 pulls off their clever satire and poke fun at the horror genre and itself at the same time and at a whole new level even above the original. Unlike other slasher flicks Scream has always been known for revealing the killer in the end and the story and twist at the end fits everything into a neat little package (unlike Scream 3.) Regardless any horror fans needs to see the entire trilogy especially with a fourth installment on the way, but Scream will give you a whole new perspective on slasher flicks, Scream 2 will demonstrate the sequel to a slasher flick exceeding even its original.

In Scream 2, the characters have seen a movie about the first killings, and are caught once again in a slasher fantasy. Like all sequels, this one is a see-through endeavor to cash in on the original, but, naturally, it knows it is, and features its own educated discourse on sequels. The finding is that a mere handful of sequels have been as good as the originals; the characters particularly like Aliens and The Godfather Part II. As for Scream 2, it's, well, about as good as the original. Both movies use a narrative contraption for making the audience flinch and gasp and grasp their pillows. The shocks this time come from a mad slasher in an oddly unsettling Halloween ghost mask, who ambushes a slew of college freshmen who lived through the initial murders. The killer is also concerned with such hangers-on as a TV newsman and a physically and emotionally wounded former deputy sheriff.Kevin Williamson's basis this time is that violence is swiftly rendered into commercial ritual by the media Because he is doing that very thing in Scream 2, there are paradoxes within paradoxes here. The movie is so expressive about what it's doing, in fact, that you can't knock it on that basis because it gets there first. Do movies prompt people to commit violent acts? Scream 2 seemed to think so, or is that a mocking position, to make the movie more effective? Have movies like this, by enlightening its audience to the traditions and ridiculous banalities of horror films, pacified their violence and make them less apt to be persuaded by the violence? Now there's an interesting thought.The movie's brilliant beginning sequence involves a theatrical premiere of Stab, a movie based on the killings in the first film, and at the screening two audience members are, well, see for yourself. Soon the slasher has moved to a neighboring campus, where survivors including Sidney Prescott are students, and the wounded Deputy Riley has found a job as a security guard. Also loitering is TV newswoman Gale Weathers, who---this is priceless satire---covered the first murders and wrote a best-seller about them that became Stab and has thus influenced the new murders. Also brooding around is Cotton, accused by Gale in the first film but found innocent, and now urging a second helping of his 15 minutes of fame. There is no way to predict the identity of the killer, and everyone who acts leery is (almost) certain to be innocent.The Williamson screenplay employs the horror scaffold as a rocket platform for considerable parody. I'd like to have seen him work on a more serious film. When Courteney Cox, playing the TV newswoman, is asked about her nude photos on the Internet, she replies, It was just my head. It was Jennifer Aniston's body. And a killer says he wants to be caught, because he's already determined his plan of action The movies made me do it, he'll proclaim, and he plans to have Bob Dole as a witness for the defense. I'll get Cochran! he boasts. The Christian Coalition will pay for my defense! Wes Craven was made to direct the Scream films. One of the most productive of horror filmmakers, he made The Hills Have Eyes and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and was already headed in the same metatextual trajectory as Williamson when he wrote and directed Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, which took his own series' blurring of reality and nightmares to a new extreme, Freddy crossing over to attack the filmmakers in the real world. There's a difference here in the Scream movies where an all-new slasher killer causes the post-modern irony to be more disguised, and what might be the most ironic thing about these ever more ironic movies is that it resuscitated the entire genre. Spawning countless imitations, the joke is on them!

And they are able to churn out a movie almost as good as its predecessor. While lacking the unique feel of the original, this movie picks up the ball and runs with it, crafting an entertaining film from the still fresh approach used in the original.The story here is that Gale Weathers has written a best selling book about the events of the first film, which has itself been turned into a film Stab (starring Tori Spelling in a nice little reference to a throwaway line of dialogue from the original). Sidney is now at College with a new boyfriend (played by Jerry Kangaroo Jack O'Connell) trying to move on with her life, but of course, it all starts to happen again. Two students from Sidney's College are found murdered at the Stab premier. She herself is attacked and she finds herself living once again in a real life horror film where everyone's a suspect.Scream 2 does have some welcome additions to the cast, with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett signing up to be slaughtered, and Timophy Olyphant showing some early promise as Mickey, the freaky Tarantino film student. Liev Schrieber's extended role is another nice addition.The script tends to be more an in joke on the original film rather than the horror genre, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had. The kills are more elaborate than in the original, which has the downside of also making them more absurd. Omar Epps death in particular bends logic.Overall though, while not as good as the original, Scream 2 is still far more entertaining than many movies that came out in the same period and is far from a bad way to spend two hours.

Sure it has a lot of good points Courtney and Neve look great! The tongue-in-cheek sequel jokes/statements are great. I always love Olyphant, Pinkett, Jackson and Gellar. And they really up'd the ante on making the now-familiar whodunit storyline a little more mysterious. Unfortunately, the bad way outweighs the good. Though, I loved the creativity, dialogue and theme to the opening, it was just plain way too drawn out and pointless to the remainder of the movie. (I see how they matched the first movie's intro, but at least that was more scary and interesting, overall.) The rest of the movie follows suit &#x96; it's way longer than it needed to be, so much could've been cut. And the coincidences/plot holes were pretty thick. It's years later, they've made a movie(-within a movie, 'Stab') which apparently sparks another blood bath for anyone who hangs out with the survivors from part one. I don't want to sound too harsh; I enjoyed this feature, it has a lot of creativity to it and it's worth watching. It has some intense scenes &#x96; my favorite is the courtyard search, but coincidentally it saddens me that my favorite character is off'd during this scene. I can't spoil too much, but the closing (another long and drawn out scene) had me rolling my eyes. As did that horrible 'Top Gun' homage. I am not at all a fan of Jerry O'Connell and definitively not one of the worst actors Liev Schreiber, and he didn't do much to change that here. Still worth a view.

Don't get me wrong, I did have fun watching it. But, like this sequel, it was very overrated, and it spawned some really bad imposters (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). But, the main problem I had with Scream was the killer GhostFace. There was nothing interesting about him/her (I'm not mentioning scary because there have only been two horror movies that have scared me. And I have had to have seen around 1,000 horror movies by now). He/she was just dull, repetitive, and annoying as hell! I just couldn't stand him/her! And this all came back to haunt me in Scream 2. GhostFace is more dull, repetitive, and annoying, and the movie had more plot holes than swiss cheese (I'll regret ever using that bad insult)! Like mentioned in the summary, this movie needed a re-write (and a more intriguing killer too). Scream 2 is also very low on gore and action, and the only excitement I had was in my pants when Neve Campbell was on screen. The only thing that I enjoyed was the ending. *SPOILERS* Sure, I didn't like the mother bit returning for revenge after her loss of her son (who was the killer and the original), and Mr. Double Duty could've been left out, because it was basically repeating what happened in the first Scream. But, I'll be damned if I wouldn't say that the action at the end wasn't exciting. We had gun shots, blood wounds, and more cheap shots than Joan Rivers on Oscar night (and the end credits had me excited, since it meant the dreadful movie was over).*END OF SPOILERS* This was just a cash-in to the first Scream.1 out of 5 stars "},{"Title":"A Nutshell Review Scream 2","Date":"11 February 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" Given the success of the original Scream, it is inevitable that there would be a sequel, bringing back cast members from the first movie who survived the massacre (Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox), and adding new popular faces that would add to the body count, like the underutilized Sarah Michelle Gellar.In case you've forgotten the iconic beginnings of this franchise, it is again reprised with a movie within a movie, as Gail Weather's (Cox) successful book about the incident has been turned into a movie called Stab, starring Heather Graham in Drew Barrymore's role, and David Schwimmer (not seen though) and Tori Spelling in the roles of Arquette's and Campbell's respectively. It's an incredibly cheesy beginning, which stayed true to the way the original was played out, and guest stars Jada Pinkett Smith too.With the original Scream poking fun at slasher flicks in general, this sequel pokes fun at, you'd guess it, sequels. A new copycat serial killer is in town and stalking Sidney (Campbell) and the surviving gang has to race against time to try and find out who this sicko might be. Could it be a copycat down to the last detail such that Sidney's new boyfriend, an alpha-male jock, is involved? Or one of the surviving cast from the first film? Or how about the innocently accused Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who's released from prison, and wanting to get back at Sidney for putting him in jail? The gore factor definitely has been reduced (or was it because I was watching a Code 3 version?) and relies on the usual soundtrack crescendos to pull in the screams (put intended)? And speaking of the soundtrack, there were moments were Broken Arrow's was used liberally throughout. The in-jokes and numerous references which made the first Scream a darling, were sadly missed in the sequel.The ending again is a twist when the killer is revealed. Though like all predictable villains, a long extended monologue always seemed to be the order of the day. Guess that's just the way the genre goes. Like what was mentioned, there are only a few sequels which surpass their originals, and sadly, Scream 2 is not one of them.Code 3 DVD was a barebones version, nothing special included, which is a pity.

Jada is playing Maureen Evans a bright young Women and hates scary movies. after her boyfriend is killed hes after her but the audience think thats its a funny stunt, but it turns out not to be funny at all when she dies in front of 200 people. When than see a familiar face Sidney Prescott, shes now at college with her new best friend Hallie played by Elise Neal and now Sid discovers its happening all over again. We than get introduced to Sidneys new Boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O Connel and too Woodsboro survivors Dewey and Randy. suddenly out of no where Courtney Cox is back as Gail Weathers and she brought along Cotten Weary because she wants Sidney to talk about what happened the year before, Sid is not happy and walks away.

She is talking to her Friend on the phone when someone is beeping in, its the killer and she starts being harassed just like Casey Becker in Scream, Gellar was outstanding in this movie as every other thing she does but I'm a huge fan of her work and everything that she does (Buffy, i know what you did last summer) and i was pleased that she was in this movie. after the killer adds her to his death list, he is after Sidney and she is attacked at a party while everyone has gone to investigate the murder of Cici. than her boyfriend goes after the killer and is than put up as a suspect. basically Mrs Loomis has come after Sidney because she killed Billy and she has a student helping her with the murders. with help from Gail and Cotten, everything turns out to be fine! plus the Killer is killing people with similar names to the original victims which gives the film a brilliant twist. although this wasn't as good, it still is one of my favs!three cheers for Neve Campbell- Always brilliant in these films!

This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).

But devoting multiple scenes to detailed discussion about how sequels are naturally inferior in a film that does nothing to assert the falsity of that argument? Not so clever.Scream 2 is flawed on so many fronts, it's hard to know which ones to devote parts of my 1,000 word limitation to. I suppose it's best to start at the beginning, which in this film is devoted to a poorly executed and ultimately pointless exposition scene that makes no sense in the grand scheme of the film. Added to that is the lengthy diatribe Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps spar on that bemoans the lack of realistic African-American characters in horror films, which is delivered by characters that stringently adhere to the silliest and most annoying African-American stereotypes prevalent in cinema. Come to think of it, all of the characters of color in this film seem to embrace those same stereotypes, so in that context, the entire logic behind their spirited debate is more offensive than witty.We also spend a great deal of time with Jamie Kennedy's returning horror buff Randy, who continues his nauseating analysis of the flaws in the horror genre, specifically his afore-mentioned philosophy on the tendency of sequels to regurgitate the more successful elements of their original animus with diminishing returns. This bit worked very well in the first Scream, which flaunted its own breaking of this mold, thus relegating Randy's soapbox testimonials to the realm of satire. But there is no satire to be found here, just a series of unfunny scenes that manage the seemingly impossibly feat of making Jamie Kennedy more annoying than we knew he was going in, and pad out an already too-long two-hour running time in the process.Two sequences in particular dare the listener to stick with the film, which ultimately doesn't prove to be a wise decision when this entire mess plays out. Firstly, Jerry O'Connell's lunchroom serenade is such a sappy and idiotic number, any likability his character generates immediately evaporates. Watching the masses of students witnessing his stunt not only joining in the performance, but cheering wildly when he concludes the song and corners Sidney for a cringe-worthy PDA, makes us wonder which genre the film-makers are lampooning here. Hadn't these guys heard of deleted scenes before? Ditto for Sidney's meaningful discussion with her drama teacher about how artists channel their emotions into pathos in their performances, and the lengthy false-alarm scare that follows.And, despite Jamie Kennedy's claim that sequels utilize more elaborate kills, nothing in this film comes close to matching Drew Barrymore's shocking exit from the first Scream, Rose MacGowan's ride on the garage door, or the grand guignol finale of the piece. In fact, the film is so tepid in this regard, we're left wondering why they bothered pointing out that they weren't supposed to be.The wry humor has become a gimmick here, and though this film does indeed attempt to resurrect the strongest elements from the first Scream, this time out the horror is so banal that the humor dilutes the few true scares to be had. It's a shame too, since the unexpected cameos and humorous dramatizations of scenes from the first film are indeed refreshing and truly funny. But, the film-makers don't find the same balance they did before, so we're left wishing that they either toned down the humor or went the full-blown comedy route. This is far too lite to be a true horror film, but Ghosty's penchant for stabbing someone every 10 minutes will likely dissuade anyone from considering this a pure comedy.The twist ending that we know is coming is dicey at best, and it was foolhardy of the film-makers to believe that casting incidental characters as our killers would have the same impact as the conclusion of the original. Like most of the elements in this film, we have to suspend our disbelief here so fully that we're never able to become engrossed in the mystery or suspense, what little there is.And what super powers do our resilient returning characters have that allows one to be shot in the stomach and another to be eviscerated from behind, yet somehow survive their wounds without incident? The former even resurfaces in the final reel, walks off under their own power, and explains, I'm okay, the bullet just bounced off my ribcage(?!). I'm not sure if this film takes place in an alternate universe future where medical science has advanced beyond our wildest dreams, but if this were the case, surely our killers should have been a bit harder to dispatch than the non-climax here would have us believe.When you consider how disjointed and auto-piloted this film is, it's easy to imagine that the film-makers knew they were working on a trilogy, and were reluctant to use what few surprises they still had left until the final film (this is even more foolhardy now, when we know a fourth Scream entry is forthcoming). While they certainly ensured that Scream 3 wouldn't have a hard time out-doing its predecessor, they also effectively buried any chance of this being a classic SERIES of films, rather than one of the one-hit wonders frequently referenced throughout.

Yep, the inevitable was near, so near it was a only a single year after the original Scream that we saw a continuation of the Wes Craven movie that spawned a huge following. This film did nothing more than take the first film to a new and alleged stereotypical setting that would be ground zero for another slasher story. I can say, however, that this film was, in event, actually better than its procedure. I guess most sequels sometimes feel more intriguing than the originals, but only to an extent. The feeling is usually only a left-over sentiment from the original winning a fans heart. In Scream 2, there is both, a sentiment, and excitement that runs along the entire film. Better yet, the first film may as well not even exist, seeing as Kevin Williamson made quite sure that any pre-requisite films need not apply this time around. You hear so much about the first one, why even bother watching? All you get is twice the gore, twice the cheese, and all that goofy Williamson dialog, fit with cheap so-called innovation.This time, we have a new movie opening up appropriately titled 'Stab'. A hot'n'happening college couple are out on a date to inspect it, or rather, he is, she should be back in the dorm studying. At any rate, trouble ensues when the culture-oriented colleagues become the hot topic of the following morning news.Yes, a second killer is here, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) cannot help but feel that somehow, it is all her fault. If this is incorrect, than Campbell gives off the wrong signals all throughout the film. Anyway, the public media creates a frenzy at a nice little college where Campbell and Kennedy from the first, now reside. Guess who else in back...Gale Weathers! Yes, the convenient 'Stab' franchise is based on none other, than the Scream original caper itself! How Very! (or not!). David Arguette also comes back as the laid-back, humble cop Dewey. We get to see more of Kennedys' rambling about supposed pop- culture sequels such as Aliens . We also receive information about slasher movies located at a college campus. We learn of House On Sorority Row, The Dorm that Dripped Blood, even a little bit about Showgirls. How fun! In any case, blood baths return, as well as more predictability and that 'lingo' issue Williamson had with the first one.Arquette, Campbell, and Cox are well on target, keeping their characters up to par with the original formality they began with. Kennedys Randy is more intellectual, and given the treatment of a saint...and for what? All he does is sit side and give his own commentary about sequels and trilogies. How original...right! Perhaps if he was not such a film geek before... Other cast members are fun to watch. Jerry O'Connel, Timothy Olephant, and Rebecca Gayheart are nice and steady. A real joker about this, is the disgustingly goofy way that Sarah Michelle Gellar has a bit part as a typical sorority girl on campus. Please...it was enough in I Know What You Did Last Summer also written by Williamson, but I remember finding out she was in this after Summer and thinking it was pretty ridiculous. There is, however, a performance that stands out major from the rest of the cast, and the award for best actor/actress in this installment goes to Laurie Metcalf, for a great comeback into film, as well as all the little manifestations she creates.The writing is slightly better than the original, and obviously so, as the first one was the starting point for all this madness and violence. The issue of extreme language and convenient movie knowledge still present, only this time, we have a full classroom of film studies, where everyone is just like Kennedys' Randy. Williamson is too enthralled to slow the pace, and thusly the story is quick and sharp, if sometimes repetitive and lacking. I suppose it is likely that Williamson reached a certain status of narcissism with the success of the first film. It is all too fake by the end. Some of the dialog is just as hammy as Thanksgiving dinner. Albeit entertaining.Wes Craven gives his usual storytelling in genius fashion, but the impact on pop-culture is still all to shocking to believe. We still have the same direction as the first, with no real end of the tunnel. New back stories and twists may come off as new direction for the story,but for the most part, it just says the same old thing over and over again. Maybe by Scream 3...

When compared to the first Scream movie it isn't nearly as good but when judged on its own, it's a quite good and enjoyable genre movie.There are more than a few reasons why this movie is inferior to its predecessor, that got released only a year before this movie did. First and foremost, it is because it's all not as fresh anymore of course as the first movie still was. The first movie redefined the genre and really brought the slasher genre back again. What does this sequel do? More of the same really, only worse and less original.So the story is definitely less fresh and less original this time, which also makes the movie a bit ineffective at times. I still like the beginning of this movie very much and probably more than the the opening sequence of the first original movie but after that the movie runs out of steam and good ideas pretty fast. It doesn't always manage to build up its tension well, which is probably because it's too self aware of its self as well. The first movie more or less poked fun at the genre and all of its rules but this one takes itself even less serious. This really goes at the expense of all of its tension.The movie also definitely starts to loose it more toward its end. It's final 20 minutes or so just aren't much good or interesting as a climax, mostly because the killer(s) gets revealed after that point but its identity and motivation aren't exactly being the most convincing or cleverly written and very forgettable to be honest. I had seen this movie in the past, even more than once I believe but I really didn't membered who the killer(s) was in this movie.But like mentioned before, as a genre movie this still remains a perfectly good and watchable one. It's a whodunit slasher, with plenty of good characters and also still some good killings. Ghostface also remains a perfect evil killer for this type of movie and it of course doesn't matter who the killer behind the mask is really for the Ghostface killer to simply keep doing his thing.It's also quite amazing to see how many great well known actors appeared in Scream movies, before their big breakthrough as well known stars. That goes for this movie more than any other one out of the series perhaps. Liev Schreiber's role gets really expanded this time and the movie also stars newcomers Timothy Olyphant and Jerry O'Connell, among many others.But what's also a strength of these movies is that it manages to keep most of its crew but also cast together for all of its movies. Basically everyone that survived the first movie returns in this one and play an important role once more. I guess it's not entirely necessary but it still is what makes the series consistently fun and also makes it distinct itself from other long running horror movie series.Don't expect the first movie and you'll still have a good time with this one.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"An idea worthy as a sequel, an execution that almost measures up","Date":"11 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery","Review":" After Scream respectfully made fun of the slasher sub-genre, this sequel was done.

Such would not have worked in the first film, for self-explanatory reasons, and while it may not all be of quite as high quality as that of the film preceding this, there are still points made. The plot is fairly good, but the reveal at the end is just not as effective as the one of the first(which, going by the Trivia, can be attributed to the original script leaking... thanks, guys, *now* will ya just let them make the movies in peace?). There are suspenseful and tense scenes in this, as well, and, as the sequel rules dictate(and as is said out loud within the film), this is bigger than the first. There's more blood and gore(though I'm not sure the death scenes are necessarily better than, or even match, the ones of the original). The characters are reasonably well-done, if the new ones aren't as interesting as those of the first. At least one character of the first gets more of a role. This picks up nicely from the first(not *right* where it left off), and should definitely not be watched prior to watching the first. If you have, however, watched Scream and want more of the same, this'll do nicely. It isn't quite as good, but it is worth watching. Score, music and sound is well-done.

It's a self-indulgent piece of crap, with its lame film-buff in-jokes and sad attempts to be original and funny by satirizing sequels, films in general, and even itself. Craven and his gang of creators are so concerned with misleading and confusing the viewer as to who the killer may be, that they totally ignore the need for logic, or at least a decent amount of credibility (decent being very little, since this is the slasher genre - the worst horror sub-genre; its ugliest offspring, so-to-speak). I quickly saw through Craven's trick to give all (key) characters motives for being killers, early on (an old, old Agatha Christie tool), and then have them suspect each other. So I tried thinking logically (a mistake, naturally) as to who this boring killer may be; I decided half-way through the film that it must be the black cameraman. Why? Because. No, sorry that would be a WES CRAVEN EXPLANATION. I can do better than that... Here's why the black guy should be the killer1) He would be the first black killer in a slasher film (or?), and this would have been terribly original in Craven's book.2) He was the film's comic-relief (and a very unfunny one, by the way).3) It actually fits in neatly with a couple of scenes in the film.& most importantly4) He has no motive whatsoever.Alas, Craven decides that one of the two killers, the student, has a motive which is ten times more ridiculous than any I have ever witnessed in any film before, and ten times less of a motive than any other character in the film had his motive is his hunger for O.J.-like court-room notoriety and media drama and fame. What does this teach us, that we never knew before? It teaches us that sometimes no motive at all is better than a Wes Craven motive. The absurdity of the other killer, the mother(!) of the murdered killer in the first part, is equally impressive this woman poses as a TV reporter (why??) (idea stolen from Se7en) in the entire film without anyone recognizing her. No one from their small town - and there's half-a-dozen of those idiots hanging around the college and thereabouts - recognized her, apart from Campbell in the final scenes.Then there is the film's finale... If I had any willingness left in me to forgive Craven for some of the many moronisms, it was all but destroyed by this laughable, manic, over-the-top, gab-and-shoot-fest finale which has to be seen to be believed! Horror films and thrillers are infamous and even feared for their awfully dumb endings, but this one surpasses even the most hardened skeptic's expectations. Yes, that's right it's possibly as dumb as Hitcher's ending. Then we have David Arquette's atrocious acting... When will nepotism finally become punishable by electrocution in Hollywood?! This guy, apart from looking like a total loser, is the KING OF ALL OVER-ACTORS and hasn't got a clue what it means to act out a scene and not grimace his way through a scene as though to show the director your latest Beverly Hills facial aerobics exercises. (Craven must have gotten a threesome with the Arquette sisters in return for putting their brother in a major film.)But we have to give Craven some credit, though the service he provided the black culture in America by finally slaughtering blacks in a slasher film, is immeasurable. Hip hop hooray. Craven is an ACLU hero!But the heaviest criticism is not that he is a commercial director, or that he works with lousy scripts, or that the plot is laughable, or that he is self-indulgent... No. It's that he is predictable. This film is in fact just that. There were at least half-a-dozen scenes which were predictable from the moment they began; it was always obvious who'd get killed and who'd escape, and sometimes even how. A sequel will be coming to cinemas near you, as soon as Craven and his gang of idiots think of a way of having even more absurd killers and even dumber motives.Here are a few suggestions for Scream 3 (& 4,5,6...)1) The Killer The great-grandfather of the murdered mother (in Scream 2) of her murdered son (Scream), who lived on Mars and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous two films.His Motives revenge, plus the fact that Martians threatened to kill him if he didn't amuse them by doing something violent on Earth. 2) The Killer The great-great-great-grandfather of the killer in Scream 3, who lived on Jupiter, and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous three films.His Motives revenge, plus the fact that Jupiterians made him do it to prove that an Earthling can amuse them as well as he can amuse the Martians (who are their rivals for rule over that asteroid belt).3) The Killers all the innocent people in the previous four parts. They kill only Neve Campbell, proving once again that Craven can still think of original plots having a dozen people kill one person, instead of the other way around. Isn't it brilliant!?Their Motives jealousy and anger over the fact that while all of them got injured and some even crippled through the series, she got away from all the violence with only minor bruises.The Reason Neve wants to finally get out of the series.

The film starts with Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her boyfriend Phil Stevens (House's Omar Epps) being murdered at a screening of the new movie, Stab, based on the Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) book. Now, a new Ghostface killer (voiced by Roger Jackson) is duplicating Woodboro in a new town and killing people with similar names, e.g. Casey 'Cici' Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now under close observation by the cops, old friend Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), Gail and her new boyfriend Derek (Stand by Me's Jerry O'Connell). The big twist for most people is that the killer is not the man once accused of killing Sidney's mother, recently released and pursuing Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), it is in fact Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant), but it is his partner that shocks, it is Billy Loomis's mother, Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf). Also starring Jamie Kennedy as the still humorous Randy Meeks, Lewis Arquette (David's Dad) as Chief Lewis Hartley, Duane Martin as Joel Jones, Heather Graham as 'Stab' Casey and Tori Spelling as 'Stab' Sidney/Herself. It was never going to be as good as the first, because there are only a few great twists and turns, but it is still some good scripting by Kevin Williamson with one or two scares and some alright giggles. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see it because I saw the spoof in Scary Movie before it, but it is a reasonable horror comedy sequel. Worth watching!

Stab is a film based upon the events of the first Scream (1996), a young couple named Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith as Jada Pinkett) & Phil Stevens (Omar Epps) attend the showing where both are brutally murdered by an unknown masked assailant. The murders are widely reported & it's not long before Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) becomes aware of the fatalities. Chief Lewis Hartly (Lewis Arquette) tries to calm the press who include Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) complete with new cameraman Joel Jones (Duane Martin) once again back trying to break a huge story & thus find fame & fortune. Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette) also shows up out of concern for Sidney, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who survived the events of the original Scream is still around & to make things even more like old times Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) turns up who just happens to have spent the last year of his life in jail after he was wrongly accused by Sidney. Sidney's roommate Hallie McDaniel (Elise Neal) tries to cheer her up by taking Sidney to a party that very night, unfortunately Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has to stay behind on her own & becomes the next victim. As the bodies pile up so do the suspects & once again Sidney must unmask the killer or pay the ultimate price...Directed by Wes Craven like the original who also has a small blink & you'll miss him cameo I thought Scream 2 was good solid entertaining fun & a worthy sequel. The script again by Kevin Williamson who also has a small cameo doesn't stray too far from the original's roots in terms of tone & feel, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Everything you expect is here, the self parody, the witty one liners, making fun of the slasher clichés & genre all done with a nice affection & considerable humour, there is a nice running gag about film sequels, their rules & the fact that their always inferior. Scream 2 moves along at a nice pace even if it could have done with a couple more murders & a few scenes maybe should have been cut or shortened because at 2 hours my interest started to wain towards the end. On the negative side it's not a big departure from the original & the ending which felt very familiar if you know what I mean was a bit of a let down, an anti-climax as it were. But then we all know that it wasn't the end was it? Yet another sequel & the last to date Scream 3 (2000) made an appearance 3 years later. Having said that I doubt you will guess the killers identity. The kills are surprising not very graphic apart from one slit throat which was a bit of a disappointment as one character rightly points out the death scenes in sequels should be bigger & bloodier, Wes Craven I hope your listening! The characters are all very likable & the cast, many of whom return from the original, do a good job. Any film with Courtney Cox, Neve Campbel & Sarah Michelle Gellar can't be all bad can it, eh lads? Technically scream 2 is very polished & well made with nice production values but with a budget of $24,000,000 that's the least I expect. One curious thing about Scream 2 was the fact that I found it a very bright film, a lot of it takes place during the day & in brightly lit rooms for which Scream 2 probably loses some atmosphere. Overall I liked Scream 2 a lot, it's great entertainment, it's not too gory & it's funny especially if your a horror fan because you'll understand & appreciate the jokes & swipes at the genre. Definitely worth a watch.

As Sidney's (Campbell) friends begin to die off suspicion seems to point to all those round her.I didn't really like the first Scream - I thought it was clever but that it revelled in it's own cruelty. Here the same problems exist. This wants to be a teen slasher movie but also be clever and look down it's nose at other slashers. It starts with the movie within a movie and uses that to make jokes out of all the things that were thrown at it first time round - causing real life violence, having no black people etc and of course it gets to discuss the rules for horror sequels and make fun of those. My problem with this is that it wants to laugh at slasher movies but also do the very things it's laughing at. This may be good once but twice and the joke wears thin, also when it is dealing with real-life issues rather than film 'rules' it is harder to swallow and misses the mark.For example Jada Pinkett derides the film Stab for being a white film and having no black people etc, just like the first Scream. But you get the feeling that this joke is a sore spot because now we have several black leads in the film even when a group of white sorority girls are onscreen they will contain a token black character. The colour shouldn't be an issue, but by pointing it out and then ensuring that Scream 2 has plenty it makes you think all the black actors are there jut to make up a quota. It's the same in other areas - the opening murders in the cinema are meant to make us look at this crowd enjoying on-screen murder watch as Pinkett is killed. We're supposed to see how macabre it is that the audience loves the onscreen violence and then see how abhorrent Pinkett's terror-filled gruesome death is.....but then we (the audience) sit and get entertained by the violence and killing that follows. I do feel that the film can't have it both ways - say look at this isn't it terrible and proceed to do just what it was making fun of.If horror is your thing then this is quite good. It has plenty of scares and jumps but it is just too cruel to be entertaining - it seems to not take fun from the excitement or the horror but from the sheer cruelty of the murders. It's not as scary as the first and most of the time you know what's going to happen - which is why the film ups the gore and cruelty of the killings - to give us something new and interesting. Outside of this the plot is funny at times but it isn't as self-referential as before. The best bits involve in-jokes among the cast such as Cox's character responding to nude internet pictures of her by saying it was just her head put onto Jennifer Anniston's body. But for the most part the mystery plot is silly and you do just sit and watch good-looking teens get picked off for 2 hours. The eventual twist is stupid - as one of the characters says Wow! What a twist! bet you didn't see that coming! Well, no - but only because the twist is so unpredictable that it's stupid. The film spends so much time making all the characters look suspicious and putting EVERYONE in a situation where they could be the killer, only to then go and do that!The original cast all return with the addition of several black faces to even it up (Pinkett, Epps, Elise Neal and others) and a few famous TV faces (Buffy's Gellar, Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi, Laurie Metcalf) all do well as the killer's victims. The film appears to be more carefree about killing it's main cast but bottles it at the end and makes sure it's got enough left over for a sequel. David Arquette and his wife have the most fun but other leads such as Gellar and Campbell just run around screaming with not much else to do until they die or confront the killer. Sad that the most beautiful woman in this only lasts 5 minutes (Pinkett) before being dispatched, Omar Epps deserved more than he got as well - but I guess the film isn't quite as equal opps as it would like to think.Overall a horror movie that replaces scares with cruelty and insults us all by making us think that we can figure it all out before screwing us with an ending that comes out of nowhere. The cast were not shown the ending until the end of shooting but I feel that if they had they wouldn't have been able to rehearse with a straight face.

Although this installment of the tragic life of Sydney Prescott has its moments (such as the great allusions to Greek literature), it has a relatively weak story.  Basically a dilapidated repeat of the first script, the movie relies on gore and startle shots rather than plot and suspense, two characteristics which made the original Scream stand out from other horror movies.  For instance, the killers (I won't reveal them here) end up being extremely minor and undeveloped characters whom the audience has not suspected at all in the first place.  In a good whodunit, the person watching should at first suspect the killer, and then be manipulated into dismissing this thought as too obvious.  The person should then flail about wildly suspecting everyone until the real killer is revealed, completely shocking them.  Instead, Scream 2 simply sells itself with more gore and throws in the most predictable killer.  For the killer's partner, Scream 2 chooses to nearly introduce an entirely new character.  Now, how is the audience supposed to suspect, be nervous about, and therefore terrified of a character they do not know in the first place?  With rumors of a third Scream surfacing, my advice to Wes Craven is this  Quit while you are ahead, or rather, not too extremely far behind.

SCREAM worked so well because it knew it was a horror movie, knew the clichés and knew how to have fun with it. There's no question this sequel was made to cash-in on the success of the first film but thankfully screenwriter Kevin Williamson also knows this and keeps the fun going. There's a terrific sequence early in the film where some film students discuss the good and bad to sequels and we've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy) giving us the rules to survive a sequel. This all adds up to a winning film even if it falls somewhat short of the original. Williamson's screenplay certain makes the mystery deeper and adds some higher quality death scenes but perhaps one of the most interesting aspects doesn't get covered as funny as it could have been. I think the movie would have been better had they toned down some of the culture references and instead took a closer look at violence in movies and how it might relate to violence in the real world. This is touch on briefly and even is motivation for one of the killers. Those who were old enough to remember when this film was in the theater will remember some copycat killers of the first film so it's clear that both the screenwriter and director are stating their opinion that you can't blame movies. It's just too bad this wasn't explored a little bit more. As with the first film, the cast hit all the right marks with Campbell perfect as the victim and and we also get fine performances from Liev Schreiber and Kennedy. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a cameo appearance but it's David Arquette and Courteney Cox who easily steal the film as Dewey and Gale Weathers. The two of them had remarkable chemistry in the film film and that carries over here as their playful banter just adds to the fun. The death scenes here are more violent than in the first film but they'll all well handled by Craven who certainly hasn't forgotten how to stage a scene. The highlight of the film is a sequence where Sidney and her friend are trapped in the back of a police car with the killer in the front seat passed out. The two girls have to try and crawl over him to freedom and this here is Craven at his very best as he milks the scene for every inch of suspense. I think the identity of the killer isn't as good as in the first film because there doesn't seem to be much intent on the mystery being a big aspect here. Of course they don't want you to figure out but when the killer or killers are finally revealed you realize there wasn't much rhyme or reason and that they could have picked anyone. While SCREAM 2 isn't a masterpiece it is rare as sequels usually aren't that good. This certainly isn't as good as the original but it's a good way to continue the story.

As this is a rapidly produced sequel to an unexpectedly successful horror blockbuster, Randy &#x96; with the help of an entire movie class - vividly rants how sequels never match up against the ingenuity and intellect of their predecessors. That scene alone is pretty clever already, in fact, because it feels as if director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson want to safeguard themselves against delivering a potentially inferior product. Scream 2 isn't a bad film, especially not in comparison with the majority of horror junk that was coming out in the aftermath of the original Scream, but indeed no match for the first. The screenplay actually does faithfully feature all the sequel clichés, like a higher death toll (particularly near the end, it seems like everybody must die) and a bloodier make-up effects. The film is also overlong and tries to be a little too clever in all its 90's pop-culture observations. Good aspects, however, include the successful change of location from a typical small town towards a university campus. Both settings are typical 80's horror fare settings. The survivors of the original film have obviously grown in their roles and the production managed to attract some interesting fresh new faces for the principal roles (like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar) as well as some cool cameos (like David Warner, Heather Graham and Luke Wilson). The plot of the sequel is as simplistic and rudimentary as that of the original. Sidney Prescott and her friend Randy are trying to carry on with their lives two years after the Woodsboro murders. When a young couple gets killed during the premiere of Stab &#x96; a horror flick based on the Woodsboro murders &#x96; it quickly becomes clear there's a copycat killer after Sidney. Despite some really good ideas and a few moments of admirable suspense (the escape from the crashed car, for example), Scream 2 is a repetitive and forgettable film. "}]
