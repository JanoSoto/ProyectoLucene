Its story is piercingly poignant, sometimes depraved, and unbearably sad. If you insist on flashy amusements and naive happy endings in your films, this is not for you. If you are real though, about the dynamics of our troubled lives, then it is for you. And if you are sensitive, then this is a film you can only watch about once a year.It is well written, directed, and acted, especially by Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas. Hayden Christensen gives us the same believable anger, sullenness and pathos as his Anakin Skywalker character did in Episode II; maybe better. He makes a good troubled teen.

Speaking as an expert whiner, yes, teenagers really are that whiney and we are that mad at the world and Hayden pulls off the anger and frustration perfectly.

Their vulnerabilities are in the open and they deal with each other as best they can.  Kline's son is confused about more than his sexuality, far more.  His first girlfriend accepts him and, more importantly, her own sexuality, with a maturity in no way undermined by a delightfully playful demeanor. As in similar films, the viewer has to suspend reality when the doomed character accepts his fate with no mention of palliative, much less curative, medical intervention.  His condition is never fully described but a quick, distant shot of murmuring doctors examining x-rays (x-rays? No MRIs, CAT scans or PET scans in a CA hospital?) brings home that the architectural model builder has hit a brick wall.The cast is first-rate - everyone plays his/her role convincingly.The message of the film is, of course, the enduring need for community.

And it's so true.  Too often we let the years slip by, and the important things slip right along with them; and it's only when something happens that we start to pay attention, and by then it's too late to do anything about it.  The good news, however, is that as long as you're still breathing there's still a chance to make amends, or at least try to.  You can try, not to make up for past mistakes (and we've all made them), but to make `today' count, which is what a man at a particular juncture in his life discovers and sets out to do, in `Life As A House,' directed by Irwin Winkler, and starring Kevin Kline.	George Monroe (Kline) is an architect, a man who can design anything, with the exception of that which is the most important  His own life.  He has a failed marriage-- now divorced for ten years from Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- a failed relationship with his now sixteen-year-old son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), he's getting on in years and he's unhappy, which is driven home by circumstances involving his job and his health that make him abruptly sit up and take notice.  His `house,' literally and figuratively, in not in order.  And he decides to do something about it.  He's determined to tear down his old house and rebuild a new one, and he begins by arranging for Sam to come and live with him for the summer.  And it will be a summer that will affect, not only George and Sam, but Robin, and a number of others, as well; a summer in which the trivial things of life are put on hold; and for once, the important things are embraced.	Working from a well written and insightful screenplay (by Mark Andrus), Winkler delivers a drama that is thoughtful and poignant (at times, even poetic), wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.  Rich in metaphor, it's an engrossing film that works on a number of levels, and will appeal to a wide audience-- many of whom will relate to George and his situation, others who will identify with Sam; and for some, it may hit strikingly too close to home.  Whatever your personal situation is, it will fall somewhere within the emotional arc Winkler creates here; and if it doesn't now, it will eventually.  Because, as this film so trenchantly points out, `life' happens.  And the most important thing is knowing what to do with it-- if not the first time around, then at least before it's too late.	He received an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto in the comedy `A Fish Called Wanda,' but Kevin Kline decidedly hits his stride in dramatic roles  As Nathan in `Sophie's Choice,' Mack in `Grand Canyon' or Ben in `The Ice Storm,' for example; and now here, as George Monroe.  Kline brings George believably to life, with a performance that hints at who George was, but most importantly tells us who he is now.  With understated subtly, he conveys his inner-most feelings in a way that enables the audience to make that all-important emotional connection with the character.  He makes you feel as though you know him; and once you do, and once you meet Robin, it's hard to understand what went wrong between them all those years ago.  One can only assume that somewhere along the line youth and a lack of focus took it's toll-- understandable in a world that bombards us daily with endless stimuli.  And it's one of the subtle perspectives that makes this film so effective.	Kristin Scott Thomas gives a convincing performance, as well, as Robin, a woman who has moved on with her life, but in whom you can discern a certain dissatisfaction with her current situation.  On the surface, her life seems agreeable, but we see through her portrayal that it is still lacking in some regard.  She seems happy to some extent, but it's more like the unfulfilled happiness that comes when one has `settled' for something.  You get the sense that what she has with her current husband, Peter (Jamey Sheridan), is somehow less than what she had with George, at least at some point or other.  Thomas does a good job of indicating the complexities of her character, dipping beneath the surface to make what could have been a one-note character alive and interesting.	One of the real rewards of this film, however, is found in the wonderfully affecting performance of young Hayden Christensen, as Sam.  With but a few TV appearances and a handful of unremarkable films to his credit (the exception being a part in Sophia Coppola's `The Virgin Suicides'), Christensen is virtually an unknown, but comes through with some extremely impressive work here.  He not only finds, but manages to convey, that turmoil of confusion and need for personal identity that every teenager experiences, and he presents it quite naturally and effectively.  There's nothing feigned or pretentious about him; the Sam he delivers comes from somewhere deep down inside, and working from the inside out makes him very real and believable.  It's a performance that should jump-start his career, which is about to be catapulted into high gear/high profile status when `Star Wars  Episode 2, Attack of the Clones' hits the screen, in which he plays the role of Anakin Skywalker.  And because of the magnitude of that film and all that goes along with it, he will never receive the acclaim he deserves, no matter how good a job he does in it; so it's important that he has this film under his belt, which demonstrates what a truly gifted young actor he really is, a fact that may be overlooked once `Clones' hits (which is what happened to Leonardo DiCaprio after `Titanic').  And Christensen's performance here is a big part of what makes `Life As A House' a winner.  I rate this one 9/10.

What could this be about? I had never heard of it. Then I noticed that it starred Kevin Kline. With a title like that and Kline as the star I thought it was perhaps a comedy. I started watching it without really knowing what to expect. It was not what I had expected, and I was not disappointed. This was a superb drama, with Kline playing a man who has one last chance to reconnect with those he loves, and especially with his teenage son Sam (Hayden Christensen), who has become rebellious and disrespectful and drug addicted and who is tempted to spend his summer as a male prostitute to make some easy money.The story revolves around George's decision to tear down his old shack and to build a beautiful new house. He enlists (commands?) Sam's help for the project, and we watch as the house (and the relationship) begins to take shape. The journey toward reconciliation in this family is captivating. Kline was absolutely outstanding as George, in what must have been one of his finest acting performances, and one of the best I've seen in a long time. Christensen was almost as good as Sam. The movie also has a strong supporting cast to help out, with folks like Kristin Scott Thomas, Mary Steenburgen, Jena Malone and Scott Bakula all adding to the story.I found the very beginning of the movie just a bit hard to get into for some reason, but once I was into it I was absolutely hooked. There are times of joy and times of sadness, and the theme of reconciliation running through the whole movie (and dealing not just with the relationship between George and Sam but with various broken relationships) is a powerful one. This was a very, very pleasant surprise.9/10 "},{"Title":"Personally, the best movie i've seen..

Kline, divorced from wife Kristin Scott Thomas and estranged from teenage son Hayden Christensen, takes it upon himself to finally build onto a shack that he had inherited years earlier. Keeping his illness a complete secret, he forces Christensen to stay with him for the summer so he can learn to know the son who has become an enigma to him.

Also along for the ride is Kline's seductive neighbor (Mary Steenburgen) who has a secret of her own and her teenage daughter (Jena Malone). Life As a House is one of those movies that gets so emotional at times, but is almost lifeless at other intervals. Ultimately the outstanding ending (one of the better of the last few years for motion pictures) was enough to put this movie over the top with me. Kline is solid as always. Christensen ends up being the real revelation here though. He plays a very difficult part and he could have drowned in the role, but instead he becomes the production's strongest swimmer. Many shortcomings hurt here, but the good things definitely outweigh the bad. 4 stars out of 5.

What vapid execution.Winkler is a veteran, and knows the long-discussed challenge of increasing the power of film by some clever introduction of space. All the great directors have had some whack at this challenge. Here's a rather direct try.The great notion is to literally make a metaphor of a spatial structure. Build a story around the home. Toss in some `Ice Storm' meets `American Beauty' neighborhood shenanigans. (Consequently, make the neighborhood homes use vile architectural notions.) Place it on the ocean allowing a `freedom' extension to the metaphor for the characters to exploit.You can just see Winkler's conference room brainstorming make the hero someone who has spent his entire life creating models but never a real structure. What the heck, set it up so he gets fired the same day he gets a death sentence. Have the art department come up with a structure worthy of the metaphoric weight.Get Kline, probably the best B-list physical actor, someone whose acting philosophy deliberately creates space around him. Use Zsigmond as cinematographer, a veteran who can stay on budget, keep things lavish and (perhaps most importantly) someone who is enthusiastic about spatial photography (like Welles' `Othello').The house design that the designers came up with is extraordinarily apt. Just as one wishes `Waterworld' focused on that remarkable trimaran, one wishes that here Winkler would have spend less time on smaltz and more on the original, central metaphor the house.That house is post and beam construction which collects the weight in posts, allowing the walls to be non-loadbearing. Here, it allows the house to be transparent, directly supporting the metaphor. The posts are sculpted and exposed, using a mortise and tenon technique. Very clean and readable. There is clear Japanese influence in stacked lintels which makes the whole affair more airey. The Japanese notion of M&T is overtly sexual, and as here, often promiscuous. In short, the designers came up with a structure that is odd enough to be remarkable, very strongly reflects the metaphoric intent and happens to allow some effective framing of shots.But alas, if it was used effectively, those shots were left behind.Side comment Steenburgen is a mistake -- because she is so good. She oozes mature sex in such a believable way she completely embarrasses the other two women. One is a child, but one the much celebrated Scott Thomas. Steenburgen's Oscar was no mistake.

We know with exact certainty that they will eventually bond, tears will flow, and the house will get built with the unenclosed toilet. There are many unnecessary subplots include the dog crap on someone's lawn; teenage girl next door who seduces the teenage son in the shower; her mother who has an affair with a teenager who falls off the roof. Not one of Irwin Winkler's better films. He previously made The Net, which is a far different film. Kevin Kline is superb as the father delivering the one performance that doesn't crumble in this travesty. Hayden Christensen on the other hand overacts as his bratty son. Kristen Scott Thomas is unnecessary as the ex- wife. Mary Steenburgen appears as the idiot neighbor who has nothing better to do than watch males that are way beneath the meter for her. Jena Malone also lives next door and unfortunately cannot find shelter from the camera when shooting begins. The theme regards experiencing life despite a screenplay that falls apart.

I was obsessed with Kevin (Kline) during that time. In a scene where George was wrecking the house modelings, I was scared at first and began to cry. I've always wanted to see this since then. I kept watching till my sister came to check on me and I was caught red handed. I used to go to a scene where Sam finds out that George is dying and weep any trouble out just like I did with De-Lovely. If I was to change everything, I would have George, Sam and the others build that house and then after it was finished, then he (George) gets cancer. Then a few months after the house was built, he's no more. This is where I admire Hayden Christensen from. His acting is not cringe worthy. Luckily he wasn't ranked or in the honorable mentions of the Top 10 worst movie actors. Though I did see him at the end of the video from Star Wars episode II. I hate them! he stated. This film is so spirit lifting and powerful. Anytime I watch that scene with George and Alyssa kissing and asking questions about kissing, I thought I'd rather shake his (Kevin) huge hand than feel his perky lips. I used to get scared when I see Kevin get hurt or die on screen. I don't do that anymore. Makeup looks more beautiful on women than it is on men. Thumbs up on everything.

His mother Robin Kimball (Kristin Scott Thomas) divorced from his father George Monroe (Kevin Kline) 10 years ago. George gets fired from his hated architectural job. He's dying from cancer and decides to tear down his shack to build his dream house. He has a combative relationship with his next door neighbor Colleen Beck (Mary Steenburgen). Her daughter Alyssa (Jena Malone) is Sam's schoolmate and she likes Sam. George forces Sam to spend the summer with him building the house. School drug dealer Josh (Ian Somerhalder) recruits Sam to prostitute himself and they're arrested by the police.I am not a Hayden Christensen fan. Other than 'Shattered Glass', I rarely like his performances. For this movie, he's well cast for this whiny bitter teen character. He has a pathetic self-indulgent streak that is perfect for this role. This movie can be overly sentimental. I would rather not have some of the sappy talk between Sam and Robin. It needs to stay focused on the father and son relationship. There are also a few too many people sleeping around. That cul-de-sac turns into orgy central all of a sudden. There is a solid foundation of a sentimental movie in the middle of everything.

There was the blueprint for a unique story that gets dissolved in so much schmaltz and allegory. I get that things are going to be left unfinished, but it seems this story wasn't finished and had to utilize cinematography and last-minute story-writing to finish what I would consider to be a lofty, yet noble, project of a motion picture.What I got was a laissez-faire attitude towards the commodification of teenage sexuality, family structure and all together communion of the soul. There are about 6 mini-stories at play, loosely connected to the main one, that warrant so much attention, but ultimately dissolve in hack endings and illusion to contentment. I can argue the vapidity of dipping in to these themes as a soft touch of narrative, but I can't argue for taking subject matter that is unique for John Q. Public, and ultimately giving it the brush off. Kevin Kline, Hayden Christiansen and Kristen Scott-Thomas carry the weight of this awkwardly shaped, yet airily light movie.Powerful performances still didn't distract me from the fact that Sam is painted in the most dismal light possible, and yet father-son bonding is supposed to be an all-healing experience for him! A great actor (and here we do see a young actor in GREAT form) still can't sell a measly product, especially one that doesn't ultimately give him a resolution rooted in reality. You don't take a paint-huffing, trick-turning, auto-erotic asphyxiating teenage boy and turn him into a strapping blue-collar vision of adjustment without some SERIOUS character changes.Even George's character could've been used to more effect, and he's the main story, the hero if you will. I see less resolution for Sam in George's parts, than I see a complexity in George's character that ultimately unwinds (to great effect, I'll admit) towards death. We see a man of great intimacy, yet commitment-phobic. Someone learning compassion bereft of social expectation. Ultimately all I see is potential dialogue that could benefit both characters, but prefers to lean on one.Then we're left with all the unanswered questions that lead me to wonder what's in the water this characters are drinking. The kind of isolation within individualism that gives this movie it's initium, again somehow becomes magicallydissipated into community. The magic of a house is wondrous, to be sure, but I can't help but feel the writer's wanted to stay away from the gritty soul-searching that this film hints at, and fails to deliver.

Kevin Kline gave one of the best performances I've seen from him as the father who is secretly dying while simultaneously trying to reconnect with his troubled teenage son as the two embark on the task of building his dream house, which itself serves as reconciliation, or better yet a new beginning. Kristen Scott Thomas forever type cast as the cheating/conflicted wife was tolerable as the ex-wife to Kline character. Having experienced what it was like to grow up without my own father I had firsthand experience as to what it felt like to keep that resentment and anger in during those crucial teen years. I saw this movie for the first time late one night while my wife and kids were all asleep and I got drawn back into what it was like all over again. I have absolutely no shame to admit that this movie had me in tears in several key scenes.

Both of them struggle to enjoy the true value of life and are emotionally hurt. Although everything changes once George is diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer and this movie depicts the transformation of their lives together. Despite being sick, George manages to keep his condition covert and he chooses to make the most of his time while he still has a chance. Sam is a misunderstood teenager who has just never received the necessary guidance to move forward in life, and looks to narcotics as an escape from the the hardships of the real world. Realizing his time is fading, George calls his son over for the summer to share what precious time he has left and to make a lasting impact that will hopefully steer Sam in the right direction. Regardless of the great story line and good performances from Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen, the movie is below par in a few categories. The supporting actors were poorly cast and their acting seemed to be completely fake in several scenes. The focus on unnecessary side stories also adds time to the film which disengages viewers due to its dullness and uninteresting themes. The soundtrack and filming was also lackluster and failed to serve this movie justice. Despite the weak performances and substandard technical aspects, Life as a House is a breathtaking film. The shortcomings of this movie pale in comparison to the overall plot and acting from the father-son duo. This movie is very deep and emotional, and touches on a lot of sensitive subjects. Exemplifying the true importance of life, Life as a House is a very strong movie that deserves to be recognized as one.

It is also about finding love again, finding a path to the heart of someone dear, and finding a way to overcome your own weaknesses, and that we should never think that it is too late, because a moment of meaning is worth every effort. This movie hosts one of the best lines in all the inspirational movies I have ever seen I can tell you I love you as many times as you can stand to hear it and all that does, the only thing, is remind us, that love is not enough, not even close. This would be on all the lists of inspirational movies if it were not so real-life, down the nitty-gritty, filth, mistakes, infidelities and addictions of the characters. That rich and balanced mix is also what makes it so believable and so touching, moving and captivating. It is a tear-jerker and a good one at that, as such family-related dramas should be. I do not know if I will go back and watch this again once or twice a year like I do Shawshank Redemption or other inspirational movies.

This is really a different kind of movie. Usually, you only get comedies that make references to all sorts of other movies, but this is probably one of the few drama pieces that makes a lot of references all over the place. You have some of the movie Valley Girl going on, You got some of the Hallmark Channels stuff going on(except the acting is good here),you have some Risky Business stuff going on, some Jerry Maguire references, then an American Beauty/Midnight Express reference, I mean all kinds of movies in this one little movie. This movie is insane, it's a big dramatic soap opera and in some weird, prolific way, it works! Hayden Christensen is terrific in this film, he's one of these actors where if he really gets and understands the material, he can be better than anyone, but if he doesn't really get the material then watch out. Although you do have to show him a little bit of mercy for the Star Wars ones, those were written so poorly that even Natalie Portman wasn't all that great either, and she's usually terrific in everything she's in.But Christensen really should have been nominated for an academy award for this movie because really he steals the movie and it's really only because of him and Kevin Kline's performance that this movie swims and doesn't sink. Honestly, if it's not for the phenomenal performances of Hayden Christensen and Kevin Kline, this movie really isn't that good at all then, but these two actors truly save this movie and make it something worthwhile to watch at least. I think I was so blown away by this movie because I think most of us as movie watchers, are so use to the traditional format of a movie, how it's written from beginning to end, and how it comes across to us on screen from beginning to end. But this movie is all over the place. It doesn't stick to anything traditional about movie writing or directing at all. And it's not a great or perfect movie by an means, but I give it props for having the guts to make an attempt for making a movie completely out of the norm and against the usual, and traditional format. Really if you think about it, life is crazy and so much is always going on. So this movie's format is correct in a sense, that life is really a big dramatic soap opera(maybe not always to the extremes as this movie, but nonetheless it is). So much is always going on in one's life and then so much is going on in their neighbors life and in their neighbors life, and it's good, bad and all kinds crazy stuff going on. So this movie shouldn't really surprise us, but it probably will surprise you because we're so use to being force fed a movie that goes by the Hollywood Format of how a movie should play out(And I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, but I am pointing that out).

Irwin Winkler's Direction is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are decent.Performance-Wise Kline's Performance as George Monroe, is truly Memorable. He sinks his teeth into the part & performs flawlessly. Kline is truly a Magical Actor & he very rightfully deserves all the respect he's gotten over the years.

He lived a simple life, in a non simple world. He had a job that he hated, and ex-wife that he still loved, and a son who hated him. He lived with a secret that would not be completely revealed until the end when it takes your breath away.

After many fights with his son, and confessions of love to Robin, George is left no choice but to tell the truth when his illness gets the best of him and he is hospitalized. The casting in this movie could not have been better. Sarah Finn and Randi Hiller were able to find the perfect people to fill the shoes and make this movie feel as realistic as possible. The movie was filmed off the coast of the ocean where many mornings were filled with a bright orange sky and the sounds of waves hitting the rocks below.

Usually the lighting used is the natural outdoor lighting, but in the garage scene when George confronts Sam's drug usage, the lighting is very dark and ominous, quite fitting given the situation. Toward the end of the film, the mood got darker the lighting also followed, carrying along with the story line and time line of the characters. Along with the lighting, the camera angles also helped to tell the story. When George was up on the roof for example, the camera angles were farther off in the distance, showing George simply as a shadow working on the roof with the setting sun as a backdrop.In the end, George was successful in keeping his health a secret until the house was almost completely framed out.

A very bittersweet story but so wonderfully done that you can't stop reflecting on it again & again.This is one of my top 25 movies of all time. Excellent cinematography, stirring soundtrack, and outstanding acting. If you have kids & aren't emotionally dead, expect to cry during this film. Powerful performances by all with particularly good efforts by Kevin Kline, Hayden Christensen, and Jena Malone. Won the Audience Award at the Aspen FilmFest in 2001. This film is a keeper & holds a top position on my movie shelf. "},{"Title":"A Chick Flick For Guys","Date":"12 May 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" It's not often I fall for those sappy melodramas ofttimes categorized as 'chick flicks'. One exception is director Irwin Winkler's 'Life as a House'. A mediocre performer at the box office in 2001, it's now paying for itself in video sales, and can be seen this month on the Love Stories channel.One reason for my affection for this film has to be that it so hits home for me. Not only is the central plot device one of my pet editorial subjects - the juxtaposition of multi-million dollar homes against pre-WWII ramshackles along California's coastline, the theme elements are some the greatest causes of my generation's middle-aged angst. Most particular among these are our success or failure as spouses and parents.Briefly, the central character, George Monroe, who occupies a dilapidated old shack situated on a prime piece of seabluff (think Laguna Beach, although filming was actually done at Rancho Palos Verdes' Long Point, former site of the historic Marineland). The home, and George himself, are the scourge of the neighborhood. The shack was left to George as a teenager, along with approved plans for a new home, to be built on the same foundation, by his abusive, alcoholic father.George takes the Metrolink to work one warm June day to find his 20-year career as an architectural model builder has been made obsolete by computers, and he has terminal cancer, with only a few months to live. He then decides to use the remaining days of his life to build the house, along with his teenage son. The son, in the custody of George's ex-wife, herself in a secure but loveless marriage, has fallen into drug abuse and the Goth culture, and has nothing but hatred and resentment for George.It's easy for a technophile such as myself to become hung-up on the way the script glosses over the realities of building a home along California's coastline, or the mention of 'mortise and tenon' construction, when in fact, it is post and beam (I've never heard of mortise and tenon being used in architectural applications). And the plot line is somewhat predictable. But screenwriter Mark Andrus, fresh from his Oscar-winning gig on 'As Good As It Gets' (also a fav of mine), keeps things moving along smartly. And he does a good job of using humor to breakup the heavy subject matter, thus succeeding in making this film uplifting and inspirational, rather than morose.But the biggest reason not to miss this film is the quality of the performances. Kevin Kline is, in the opinion of this critic and many others, among the greatest actors of my generation. And his work as George Monroe is positively Oscar caliber. And Kristen Scott Thomas follows his lead like Ginger following Fred. Apart from being far more articulate than one might expect in real-life (This is necessary, as anyone who's tried to communicate with a typical real-life teenager knows.), Hayden Christensen is convincing as George's son Sam. And young Jenna Malone is not to be missed as ingenue-next-door Alyssa. This film is a high water mark for the actor's craft.While children will have little to relate to here, and Jenna and Hayden make this film watchable for teens and twenty-somethings, this is basically a movie for mature adults. So guys, the next time the SO wants you to pick up a video for 'date night', here's one that won't make you wretch.

For Kevin Kline gives such a moving and genuine performance, you just can't help but feel for his character. Also, Hayden Christiensen, in his pre-Star Wars days truly shines as a... well, Emo youngster that really wants to be loved, and Jena Malone makes you wanna be young again just so you can fall in love with her character.With such unique talents and a straight-forward message of love and lust for life, this film is an underrated lost gem in the early cinematic years of the 2000's.

The characters are well written and well developed. It is a character study that is honest and poignant. In my opinion it, has not received the recognition it deserves. Kevin Kline does an amazing job portraying a man who wants to change. It is the best performance I have seen from Hayden Christensen. It is a wonderful drama with a million little things that make it so great and worthwhile. So many movies today do not seem to have a story or plot. Content is becoming increasingly less significant but this film proves that there are still good writers out there. It is beautifully made and is an excellent watch. There are two lines from the film that stick with me. The first is I haven't been touched in years. It is devastating that society today has become too hectic to care about what's happening to the person next to you. The other line I like is What you think you know doesn't have much to do with reality. As I said before there are just a myriad of elements that make this film incredibly enjoyable. It touches on relevant topics and should be remembered as one of the best films released in 2001.

Life as a House is a bluntly earnest movie that was not made to impress (though it is impressive) it was made to portray some really complex and delicate human emotions. It's firmly a drama in the sense that it deals wholly in the realm of human frailty and dignity, folly and triumph. The film wears it's heart on its sleeve, not anything art-house of self-important intellectualism. As for the acting, I wish no one had ever seen Star Wars because then they could see that Christiansen's portrayal of a teenager is frighteningly accurate. Kline and Thomas are consistently excellent actors, and both show depth and humanity in their respective characters. The plot of the movie is messy, with the subplots that seem pointless when compared to be big picture, and maybe that's the point. Life isn't all huge moment of importance, but sometimes, if we get past the crap and the petty things, those moments are there, if we look. You'd probably like this movie if your aren't either too morally pious to get past the R rating, or too smug and full of yourself to like an honest, beautiful story.

Some scenes you might not want to watch with your mum... And beware - Kristin Scott Thomas' faux-American accent is quite annoying.

Need i say more? True, the movie contains more swears than can be heard coming out of the mouth of a lumberjack who just dropped a log on his leg, but how can you not love a guy (Hayden Christensen) who even SWEARS amazingly?Back to the movie.Emotionally pleasing, this movie should be watched by ALL fathers. I repeat, LIFE AS A HOUSE should be watched by ALL fathers. Teenagers think differently and this movie is a brilliant insight into the brains of a teenager. Sam Monroe (Hayden Christensen) is a Gothic (there is nothing wrong with being a goth, i'm one myself) teenager who is way into Marilyn Manson, piercings, drug and substance abuse and gayism. He hates people and is really bitter towards the world. Hayden does a brilliant job portraying Sam. KUDOS to him.Kevin Kline plays George Monroe, father to Sam. Acting on his part is amazing. He portrays all the right emotions at the right times and i think reminded all viewers that fathers can be imbercilic at times, but they definitely love us.Storyline Fantastic story by whoever wrote it. It just needs to be toned down on the swears and it should be rated 18.I recommend this movie to all fathers and children.

On the other hand, as the house is being rebuilt, George starts to feel the effects of his cancer, and begins to die.My experience with this film is that I heard that it was a good movie, so I rented it, and watched it on September 27, 2005 at my house.At the beginning of this film, we see Sam as this one-sided, angsty teenager, who is on the wrong side of the track, dealing with everything from drugs to small-time prostitution; yet as George takes Sam for the summer, wanting them to build a house together (with enormous opposition from Sam, mind you) we start to see a bond developing. On event is when George jumps off the cliff and into the ocean. At this point Sam has nothing but hate for his father, saying, you're totally insane and my father is a total wacko. The major turning point in this film is when Sam flips out about George flushing his marijuana down the toilet. Sam starts screaming You never cared about me before (minus his bad French) and Georges' response of Well, now I do care really hits Sam. George pushes him down on the bed, and makes Sam listen to him, making him realize that he has to change. At this point, Sam himself realizes this, and helps George tear down the house, and their old relationship. We get his sense because the very next morning he wakes up early, and helps George with his house, where he would just lye around doing nothing before; he also is nice to his little brother and Mom for a change. Another aspect that gives us this change in Sam in his appearance; he no longer has his piercings, and has taken off all his makeup. When George finally tells him that he is dying, Sam flips out, starts crying and punching walls; this is a clear indication that he has made a one hundred and eighty degree turn from where he started, he actually cares about his father.Another relationship in question is that of Robin, George's ex-wife. Right from the start, we can definitely tell that they are exes; when George tries to touch Robin's face, she attempts to bite his finger! How much more hatred do you need? Needless to say, there is a definite tension between the two. George happens to tell Robin that she is the most beautiful person he has ever met, and she's shocked and outraged by this statement. I think this is the moment in the film where she starts doubting her relationship with both George and Peter (her current husband). One evening, when Peter is eating a dinner that Robin fixed for him, she asks him if he thinks it's odd that his kids don't hug him. We can certainly tell by this that she doubts him as a father. She visits Sam the first day he's at Georges', and she comes back the next day, and the next, and the one after that, as well as the next and tomorrow too. She helps George tear down the walls, and brings her kids (that she had with Peter, not George) to help, as well as lunch for weeks. Peter has a talk with Robin about maybe them taking a vacation sometime, but she tells him that she can't because she needs to help George with his house (not in those frank of terms, though); Peter realizes then that Robin doesen't love him anymore. The next day, Robin videotapes the construction, which shows us that she wants to develop her relationship further with George, and she even dances with him. When Peter leaves Robin, she tells George (in a way) that she still loves him, while he as well loves her back. There is tension between the two though, because George tells her that love is not enough, ans when Peter tries to get Robin back, we can tell that she wants to be with George nonetheless.On the other hand, while Georges' relationships are being built up simultaneously with his house, he is being torn down with his terminal cancer. This is being played up the most when Sam states that George looks like crap lately, and George responds with 'you're looking better than ever'; this just seems ironic how just when Sam is getter better in a sense, that George would be dying, and not be able to be with the new Sam for much longer. One's bar of life, so to speak, is being raised while the other is being lessened. Throughout the construction process, George starts to feel the effects of his cancer; he's taking more and more pills, sleeping in the middle of the day and looking pale and sickly. It seems to be as though it is a sort of re-birth, with Sam and George in the end. George dies, but Sam lives on in the spirit of George.We never find out how other people react to Sam's change, and I think that would be interesting to know; maybe we can hope for a sequel.

The concept was great--- after being fired from his job and finding out he has a serious illness, the main character decides to bond with his estranged teenage son and make peace with his ex-wife while building a house that he can be proud to leave to his son.However, I had mixed feelings about the performances and the way the characters were written. Kevin Kline delivers a heartfelt performance as George Monroe, as does Kristin Scott Thomas as Robin Kimball(George's ex-wife) but I did not find myself engaged by them until the last few minutes of the movie. I did find myself engaged by George's son, Sam (Hayden Christensen), who seemed the most emotionally open of the characters. I also liked Jena Malone. As George and Sam's neighbor, Alyssa Beck, she provides a little sunshine for both the movie audience and Sam, while Mary Steenburgen and Ian Somerhalder, as Colleen Beck and Josh respectively, introduce an unnecessary soap opera quality to the film.As for Robin's current husband and children, their purpose was limited. Robin's husband, Peter Kimball, is barely present in the film, which I guess is one of the reasons that their marriage is troubled. The children are cute, but they seem to be merely accessories for their mother, whom they accompany on visits to her ex-husband's.I also felt that the movie has just too many badly used clichés to truly hold people's attentions 1) the middle-aged mom who sleeps with the boyfriend of her teenage daughter, 2) the middle-aged man who undergoes a spiritual awakening only after losing his job and being told he has four months to live, 3) the angry scary looking teenager who gets his bearings, a makeover into a respectable looking guy, and a new free-spirited girlfriend after meeting said girlfriend (although the reverse sometimes happens in films respectable guy loses his bearings, and adopts angry scary looking persona after meeting a free-spirited girl). But, like I said before, while Sam and Alyssa's relationship followed a cliché, I actually found it the most interesting part of this film, and real at some level. In fact, some of my favorite films have relied partly on clichés; so it really depends on how you approach them.Although I must admit that this film actually did make me cry at the end.

Unlike many films, it is willing to take a very critical look of a lot of suburban values and portrays the most of the characters as unhappy and looking for something more in life -- it shows human sentiment as truly as it can be shown.Through the film one grows very attached to all of the characters, and one genuinely gains understanding and insight into who they are and what it means to be them. That is why this film becomes thoroughly haunting & touching.I recommend this film to most anyone -- from the beginning to the end I was enraptured by it and caught up in the story & pain; this is a film that if you take at its' face value you will enjoy it.

I didn't like how Sam gave the house away at the end. Though I could see how it completed the story I always felt a sense of disappointment.. Though that is what the movie is about anyways?

Well, see this because he really can act but that is not the most important thing in this movie. This is not an art-movie but it hits close because it has a different attitude, it's more open, more complex and lot more entertaining than many other drama movies are.Hayden Christensen portays Sam, troubled kid involved with drugs and small time prostitution, who has to move in with his dad for a summer and tear down their old house and build a new one. Sam's dad, George, is played by Kevin Kline, whose chemistery with the young acting talent is just great. Sam doesn't want to move anywhere but isn't happy at home either because hid step-father, Peter (Jamey Sheridan) doesn't care about him at all and his mum (Kristin Scott Thomas) doesn't have time or strength to care.George forces Sam to move with him and Sam hates him. But when time passess Sam starts to love and like his father as they are building their lives as a house. Their relationship grows slowly and has to go thought a lot until they are actually happy and can bear each other. In the beginning Sam is very arrogant and mean to his dad who tries to understand his son and teach him about life. Sam doesn't care - and in order to torment his dad - he complains about everything. The movie is very well constructed which makes it easy to access. The characters are very convincing and in the same time so warm and so cold and distant.The humour reminded me alot of Buffy The Vampire Slayer series. The writer, Mark Andrus, is able to see how funny some situations can be. The humour indeed is the salt and half of the soul in the movie. Like in Joss Whedon's series, it is all about relationships. Sam falls in love with Alyssa (Jena Malone) and Goerge and Sam's mum start to have feelings for each other. But there is something that Sam doesn't know - his dad is dying!The end felt too much like Disney ending, so it certainly hurt this movie because in many other ways it is avoiding stupid cliches. This is full of great performances and the director clearly has good picture of the flaws that are within our society and behaviour.

The story pulls you in immediately and you become so involved with the characters that you feel as if you know them, and genuinely care what happens to them. The parallel between the actual building of George's dream home in replace of his old shack of a house and his getting his life in order and his important relationships back to where they should be (most especially with his son Sam) is superbly drawn and brought to life through the excellent acting by the cast.  I thought Kevin Kline was wonderful in the lead role and the entire cast was great, but Hayden Christensen truly stole the show here with his amazing performance of the troubled Sam.  He is so good at showing the character's inner pain and turmoil without going over the top - anyone who has ever had any sort of angst in their life can truly identify with his Sam because of his realistic portrayal.  He shows the teen's pain & turmoil without ever making Sam seem irritating or whiny, which is a fine line to walk.  I found myself feeling such sympathy & empathy for his character, and the whole while rooting for him to pull himself out of his funk and rebuild his relationship with his father (and the rest of his family), as well as embark on a budding romance with Alyssa, and just to be happy.  I can't remember when I've seen a better performance in such a challenging role. A truly excellent performance by the very talented Hayden Christensen and a truly excellent movie!

I remember the years when you felt no one loved you and you wished everyone would just leave you be.  When we grow up we start to appreciate what we have and we start to see how building a life is a very self-fulfilling process.  My mother's diagnosis with cancer probably also added something to this movie for me.  It, unfortunately and I of course wish she was diagnosed, added more reality to this movie and allowed me to see how real and how beautiful such events, as shown in the movie, could be.This movie could be less or more impactful for you and that is the beauty of movie critiques; it is all opinion!  I would encourage you to see this movie whether you ultimately like it or dislike it will depend on how much you are willing to listen and then analyze your own life with the questions this movie brings up.One quick reminder for would-be movie reviewers.  To say something like don't compare this movie to American Beauty implies your bias and your close-mindedness.  These are all opinions here and your critique should be to encourage others to see or not see the movie not promote your own person bias of which films are better.  Talk about the movie as a work in itself and not how it holds up to other works.  American Beauty was certainly a good movie and I know you obviously hold it in high acclaim, but that does not necessarily mean everyone else should.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Seeing it again on video was an eye-opening experience, for this film has all the makings of an underrated classic.First of all, the Kapra-esque script by Mark Andrus is superb and unabashedly emotional.  Call it syrupy if you will, but don't discount the sparkling dialogue and raw emotion displayed by the characters.  An obvious parable?  Yes, indeed.  And like all good parables, what appears simplistic on the surface is actually layered with complexity.Veteran director Irwin Winker sets his action in seemingly perpetual postcard conditions on the California coastline, with his splendid ensemble cast hammering more nails than an Amish barn raising.  The actors are lead by the always divine Kevin Kline, with strong turns by Hayden Christensen, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Mary Steenbergen.  LIFE AS A HOUSE is one of those rare films that delivers on many levels, making it hard to put a finger on why the film works so well.

It starts off as another story about a man dying and trying to redeem himself, reaching a state of perfection even as his body is falling apart--a theme all too common in movies as somehow death builds to a theatrical finale.What makes this one different is a touch of reality, and some likeable characterizations.  Kevin Cline has usually been consistent in making good performances, and he makes George Monroe as someone we empathize with, even though we see him at the start as a seedy character you can practically smell through the television.  We've all had jobs we hated, but stuck with as that was how to get food on the table.  George finding out he's dying and losing his job is about as much a double whammy as you can get.  But rather than curl up and accept the inevitable he decides to try and turn things around, and therein is the plot of the movie.One can go on and on about what it symbolized to build a house as your dying monument, and there's several meanings that could be read from it.  My spin is that George built the house to show what he wanted his life to be, and how he saw himself, rather than as atonement for his father's sins or his own misdeeds.  In his life George had lost his wife, nearly lost his son, and his life and house were a falling apart mess.  Yet he still had plans on how he would tear the shack down, reconcile with his family and so on.  Facing his mortality George brought his inner self to the fore, and made his view of what he wanted to be reality.Things aren't perfect, as it's not likely he would have patched his relationships entirely in a summer, or the neighbors would chip in and help out, but the thought that sort of thing *could* happen is what drives the story.  Giving the house away at the end was something I didn't really see as atonement for what George's father had done as much as making the same sort of amends he'd done throughout the movie, setting the things right he hadn't done before.It's a movie I saw several months ago and I still think about it a lot, the ideas it brings up stick with you, and it's one of the better movies I've seen in years.

Man tries to connect with his family. Man builds house which symbolises the way he is rebuilding his relationship with his family.The truth was in the middle. There are your usual manipulative, lightweight, Disney-like scenes and plot elements but the movie possesses an endearing freshness and often brutal honesty. It resembles American Beauty very much in its overall feel.The performances are spot on. Kevin Kline proves what an incredibly versatile actor he is breathing life to George, the lead character. Kristin Scott Thomas has wonderful chemistry with him and gives a sensitivity to her character which saves it from being boring. Hayden Christensen is so natural it is difficult to think of him as merely an actor playing a part. It was quite a risky part considering that we're first introduced to Sam, his character, as he is sniffing some chemical and trying to engage in autoerotic asphyxiation hanged from the clothesrack in his closet. He infuses a certain innocence in the portrayal and for the most part does not make Sam into your typical angry youth. Jena Malone is a revelation as the Lolita across the street. As is the case with all female characters in the film, hers is a grounding presence. In a way her character comes close to a combination between Thora Birch's and Mena Suvari's characters in American Beauty. She and Christensen are both excellent, especially in the scenes where she steps in the shower with him.In all, Life as a house is a film definitely worth watching.

In re-establishing a relationship with his son and ex-wife, George discovers happiness in his life that had previously been only an unrealized potential. In parallel, the house he builds mirrors the emotional ties he mends. And we find ourselves captured by the positive energy that George is able to give to those around him.Missing is George's transition from simply meandering through life to taking charge of his life we see the results, but never gain insight into his character. We see George find out about his illness, and later see him full of purpose. The gap in between would have helped establish his motivation.Also missing is Sam's transition from rebelling from George to accepting him. This should have been a much bigger obstacle for the characters to tackle. Sam had stopped listening to his parents, having lost respect for them. He has installed a lock on the door to his room and refuses to answer their knock. He separates and distances himself from others. His prominent piercings and blue hair stand out against his more conservative classmates, who accuse him of being a 'freak'. Curiously, after ignoring other people, he listens to George after a brief 3 minute lecture, which initiates a change in his behavior. Unfortunately, this is out of character for Sam without some motivating factor.Kevin Kline does a decent job playing George. There are a several scenes where he appears to be too strong and in control for a person as sick as George, but this is minor. In one scene he is taking morphine for pain and is out of it so much that his speech is slurred. He raises his head off his pillow for a moment, but when he sets it down he displays a control that shouldn't be there.Hayden Christensen is well suited as Sam. I am convinced that if I were to meet him in person, I would dislike him for being that 'young with attitude' person he seems to be so good at playing (and I won't even mention Star Wars...). Hayden's character stumbles through a life which doesn't hold much purpose for him. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Hayden act any other way, so I can't tell if this is a skill or by accident. Perhaps they could have just flashed some more of his young, tight body on screen to make up for it. Another near-miss is Sam's uneven angst. He tells his family he wishes they would all go away and leave him alone. In other scenes, he talks about love, even though he has yet to find his first love in life.Several small sub-plots should have lived only long enough to make it to the cutting room floor, including the one involving Josh and Helene. Suffice it to say that they didn't add anything to the heart of the story, leaving the impression that they were simply tacked on to amuse bored viewers who couldn't handle the main plot.This movie doesn't fit the typical style of movie I tend to watch. This isn't because I am insensitive to emotional dramas, but rather that I am sensitized to images of death, having watched my brother die over a period of years.In closing, there were a lot of difficult, emotional things that the movie got right, and a lot of small things that were uneven and wrong. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would watch it again.

There's always some little character nuance or other detail that makes me understand these people a little more.I think, though, that the best part of this movie is the music.

I would say that is a good metaphor in these times, though.  I don't usually go for the sap but this one was fairly good.  And, yes, I cried quite a few times.  Kevin Kline was great, but I thought Kristin Scott Thomas was fabulous.  I also thought her American accent was particularly believable, as well.  She just glows here, as she usually does,  as she did in Gosford Park.  The whole cast was pretty good, too.  This is a typical story about infiltrating people who live the good life in wealthy neighborhoods, but in the middle is this man who hasn't moved up with the rest of the crowd his age in his neighborhood.  The shack he still lives in seems to have been surrounded with people who have more money; but it's not that they have more money than he does, it's just that he is stagnant and hasn't progressed passed the past in which he was generally more happy.  The movie also points out that the people with a more showey lifestyle, who live in the nicer newer houses are not as happy as they would appear to be either.  But it is really a touching story, though, because as he rebuilds his life, he reforms the relationships that have faded over the years and rectifies everything as the house is finally finished.  The lifestyle of his enstranged son shows particularly well how bleak everyone's lives have gotten over the years.  One might think he is a typical teenager but he acts out in way that scream the pain that he is in, whereas everyone else just hides their pain at being desperately unhappy. I thought they did this very well, in a realistic way even though it seems over the top.  It is not over the top because I know for a fact that this is how self-destructive kids live.*** spoilers *** He sniffs aerosols from a can immediately upon waking up for school, then goes to the closet where he hangs himself from a robe tie so that he can jack off.  What a wonderful way to wake up!  But it shows how desperate he is to feel something, rebelling all the while.  The next scene shows him at school being offered,  for what seems like the hundredth time, from a fellow student the chance to make $300 in 2 hours.  They keep this explanation from us for a good part of the movie, but it ends up that this kids is setting him up to be the recipient of oral sex by the more affluent members of male society mentioned above.  No wonder his life seems so unhappy,  if he engages in such behavior. We find it it's generally to keep himself in drugs, so that he can withdraw from the world further, as he does with headphones on and music blaring into his ears.I thought this was sad enough of a teenage sexual reference for one movie. I did not enjoy when they also added in that George's next door neighbor started having sex with her daughter's boyfriend.  The kid mentioned above, who set up the sex for George's son.  For one thing, it got to be a little incestuous among all the main characters.  Also, I got the feeling they were just trying to hammer the message home that everyone had secrets, and everyone was messed up in the head.  But I think we already knew that. Afterward, they also had this woman's daughter kiss George; and though I think she is an entirely different character, genuinely more happy than the rest and very curious, I didn't see why they needed all that,  and thought it generally took away from the story as a whole.********* end spoilers *********Generally, this was a good movie, with a great message.  The ending is sad but ultimately hopeful, and all of our main characters have made strides toward greater happiness.  Everyone seems to be walking down a more satisfying path for themselves,  and we're happy for them.  I'd put this one on the scale with American Beauty because it has that same sort of feel in it, and similiar themes and characters.7 of 10 stars "},{"Title":"**** out of 5","Date":"11 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This film is one big metaphor just like its title would suggest.

This is one that needs and explanation. This movie was very, very good, but it could have been great. This is the incredible, touching story of a man and his decision to grow up and even more importantly, the effects his decision has on others lives. His son's being the most important. It is beautiful to watch Hayden Christensen's character's growth into a good person. He does an excellent job. I would almost say perfect if i were the kind of person to use that word. (i, however, was not near as impressed with his portrayal of Anakin, but i think that had largely to do with...other factors, not to insult anyone) Unfortunately, this movie does have a downside. There are characters in this movie who do nothing but bring it down. The only purpose the girl serves is in her relationship to Sam, but evidently someone felt the need to tell of her relationship with her mother who is a person that can seem so good and then prove herself not to be worthy of respect. The character of Josh had one or two excellent scenes again all having to do with his interaction with Sam. And again, they ruined this by tying him in where he didn't belong. I am glad the performance by Kevin Kline, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Hayden Christensen were so incredible they made it possible to look over the other characters and still appreciate this movie. I would like to make it clear that the performances by all the actors were very good in my opinion and just because i think the character is superfluous, doesn't mean i think the actor/actress is at fault in any way.

It heals while suggesting, without preaching, the need to build something in life other than monuments to one's demons.  Stylistically, American Beauty comes to mind but an entire community/extended family is transformed in House, not just the lead character.  Life as a House is, then, really more Phenomenon where solar panels, telekinesis, and sweet fantasy are replaced by architecture, hammers, and the grim casualness of contemporary family life.  Both Georges die but raise their friends by sharing their dreams in the process.All I can be responsible for is what goes on in my own head, the film suggests.  What goes on in George's head is a deep, life-long desire to make something beautiful out of the intense pain of his youth and the life he made of it subsequently.  And beauty he does make in one of the best portrayals of an architect, architecture, and architectural processes on film.  (Anyone who has every worked in an architect's office will get this comment vividly).  Neither Gary Cooper's stoney Howard Roarke or Cary Grant's feckless Mr. Blandings, Kevin Kline creates a complex character with which every man who has but three goals--to plant a tree, build a house, and raise a son--can identify.  Kudos must be given to the production design as well because the house, itself, is muscular, intricate, transparent, and beautiful.  Its defects notwithstanding, Life as a House is an important and thoughtful film.  "},{"Title":"A real tearjerker","Date":"23 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I liked this movie.

He really should have been up for an Oscar for this one.  One of the cricisms on this site is that his character, Sam, is portrayed as a bad kid when he has make-up on and he suddenly loses the makeup and is good. First off, this is a two hour movie that does not have the time to show how long an actually transformation like this would occur.  Another thing is that this is what often happens, and I know from experience.  Often as kid I would dress up weird because I felt insecure and didn't really like myself.  As I became a more confident person, I lost my desire to stick out. This was the same transformation that I saw in Sam.  I realize that this is not always the case, but it is many times.Anyways, if you like movies that tug at your emotions and make you think, this movie is perfect for that (along with another Kevin Kline movie, Grand Canyon) "},{"Title":"Tuning up your heartstrings","Date":"11 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  We are all familiar with the common devices that Hollywood uses to evoke (or manipulate) an emotional response from the audience; a soft stare into the sunset as the strings gently sway or a cream pie in the face usually has us laughing or crying like an overwrought Pavlovian dog. In fact, these techniques have become so typical that they're like emotional cue cards for us, the cynical audience, as if we are the bad actors that need help. Of course, every now and again, a film comes along that does it so perfectly that you have to give credit where it is due &#150; and Life As A House is such a film. The storyline is fairly familiar, middle aged man is diagnosed with terminal illness and has a few short months to put his affairs in order and give the relationships he's neglected their proper due &#150; the kind of thing that normally makes for a &#145;sure thing' come the Academy Awards night. Even so, there's an incredible honesty in the performances of Life As A House's cast that transcends both the formula and the accompanying cynicism about such saccharine fare. In fact, it seems that the cast were thinking much more about the story and the interpersonal relationships throughout the narrative rather than writing drafts of their acceptance speeches. Kevin Kline takes the lead as George Monroe, a man diagnosed with terminal cancer at about the same time he is retrenched from his job building models for a firm of architects. He chooses not to share this information with his estranged family, comprising of the remarried Robin (Scott Thomas) and his decidedly wayward son Sam (Christensen). With his redundancy payment in one hand and his X-rays in the other, George decides that it is finally time to realise his dream of tearing down his beachside shack and building a house of his own in its place. Understanding that time is short, he enlists the help of his son, hoping that working on the project together will bring them closer together. Sam begins the film as the quintessentially insecure &#145;rebel without a hint of a cause' teenager, who has directed his self-hatred outward, screaming at everybody &#150; when he isn't inhaling butane while performing acts of auto-erotic self-asphyxiation. In other words, a pretty regular young adult. With his partially dyed hair, labret piercing and punkish mode of dressing, this reviewer let out an inward groan of disappointment; was this to be yet another Hollywood example of how all outsiders are essentially the same and will be much happier once they've learnt to conform and embrace &#145;family values', a la Ally Sheedy in The Breakfast Club? The short answer is &#145;yes and no'. Although Sam does make steps towards conforming, they are part of his character's natural journey into adulthood, and just this once, forgivable. It's pretty much the same with disgruntled George's journey into appreciating life, his family and friends. Central to all of this is the building of the house, a symbolic motif no less powerful for all of its obviousness. If it seems like we're having difficulty reconciling the use of clichéd devices with good filmmaking, you're right. The fact remains that Life As A House is a deeply moving story, exceptionally well told, featuring a fantastic cast. After the tear-jerking finale, a realisation dawned on your jaded film correspondent. While most of these saccharine films use emotional devices so bluntly that you get annoyed at the pummelling, Life As A House allows you to experience emotions that you'd normally devote a great deal of time protecting yourself from. In a world that despises weakness like never before, perhaps we need another Capra like never before.Let this film take you where it will.

But in the scenes that really mattered, Kline had me thanking God that neither of them got his part.  Kristin Scott Thomas has never been more convincing.

It is hopelessly bogged down with superfluous plot lines, excessive dialogue, and wacky token characters with no real relevance to the story. And yet, House manages to overcome all of those flaws to become a truly heartfelt, emotional movie.It must be stated, right off the bat, that Hayden Christensen is the star of this movie. As Sam Monroe, the blue-haired, multiple-pierced, hopelessly drug-addicted son of divorced parents George (Kevin Kline) and Robin (a mostly stoic and stone-faced Kristin Scott Thomas), Christensen is given his first camera time huffing paint and throttling himself with a necktie in his closet before jacking off. All of this before he even eats breakfast. This character is essentially unlikable; he antagonizes his mother, hates his oddball father, and dabbles in prostitution for baggies of marijuana. When he is forced to spend the summer with terminally-ill George (who wants desperately to repair their damaged relationship before he dies), Sam is quick to down his father's painkillers and verbally and emotionally attack him. It's amazing what Christensen weaves into this character. Underneath the hostility and hatred is a frightened boy who wants to reach out to George but won't. He is so convincing and believable; the scene after George flushes Sam's drugs was my favorite, sublime acting on both parts. Even when Sam removes his chin ring and stops popping pills, he's still edgy, still needs a shoulder to fall onto. I don't really like Jena Malone in her role as Alyssa (Sam's love interest) but boy, those shower scenes were surprisingly intense. Of course, you can find fault with this film. There are plot holes that rival the Grand Canyon (exactly what disease does George have again? Oh, wait, they don't actually say). Kristin Scott Thomas was duller than dirt for the first 75% of the movie. She warmed up after a while, but only she could deliver, deadpan, a line confessing that she hates her own son. The whole Mary Steenburgen/Ian Somerhalder line should have ended up on the cutting room floor; it had nothing to do with the plot and didn't involve any relevant characters. Kevin Kline was outstanding, but still, Hayden Christensen stole the entire movie out from under him.If you're looking for big-name stars and perfect filmmaking, don't come within a mile of this movie. If you want a truly endearing, emotionally intense movie showcasing some very talented newcomers (and veterans), I highly recommend it.

There was some good acting and some very good writing going on.However.There were elements that felt terribly contrived, the main one being the charaters' transitions.  There seems to be a theme of I'm a bad person, now I'm a good person going on here.  People do not change so extremely so quickly.  American Beauty is more I'm a mixed-up person all the way through.  Which is why it works better than Life as a House it is more realistic.  Some other similarities between the two films angst in affluent suburbia, troubled marriages, revenge at the office, unusual neighbors, unruly teenagers, and a male voice-over at the end to tie the whole thing together.  Both films even have a look closer-ish tagline and Scott Bakula in a minor role.  Even the music is similar.  Spooky.Nevertheless, Life as a House just does not weave all these dramas together as well as its blueprint, 'Beauty', did.The other thing about this film that is a bit annoying is how it seems to really squeeze the tears out of you.  It's pushy about its tear-jerker quality.Having said all that, it's still worth a rental.  It's a well cast film with a decent script, which is saying a lot compared to a lot of the rubbish released these days.Out of 10? 6 1/2, maybe 7.  Okay, 7.

Originally, I went to see this movie because I am so madly in love with Hayden Christensen (wow, he is so hot in this movie...yum!).  Anyway, this movie really touched me. I already knew that Kevin Kline and Kirsten Scott Thomas were both excellent actors, but I was completely unprepared for the superb acting job which earned Hayden a nomination for a golden globe for this film.  The strange thing about this film is that I cry harder every time I watch it.  This movie will move you on so many levels, I guarantee it.  (That is, unless you are heartless!) "},{"Title":"Brilliant on Second Viewing","Date":"4 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I rented the DVD last night after seeing the original run in the theater. The film, for me, was even more impressive on the second viewing.  (It's unbelievable the things you miss when you are in the middle of a movie crowd.)First off, I commend Irwin Winkler for having the intelligence to encourage and/or allow Hayden Christensen to take the role of Sam and run with it. My word, I have rarely seen such intense portrayal of teenage despair and self-destruction.  Some have criticized Hayden for overacting.  I don't believe that.  Troubled kids DO cry and rage when they are in pain and Hayden nailed every one of those scenes.  It was a brave and honest portrait.WARNING - SPOILERS BELOW!One of the subtleties I missed the first time around was the scene with George (Kevin Kline) and Sam on the cliff at sunset.  On second viewing I learned that George had made a half-hearted suicide attempt off that same cliff in his youth.  Right there you see that George DOES understand the depth of his son's unhappiness and is willing to talk about it.  Compare that to the mother who is in denial and hopes that Sam's problems will just somehow *go away.*Another amazing scene takes place in the garage when George physically restrains Sam and the words child abuse come up.  George's reaction to that and his retelling of the abuse he suffered at the hands of his own father are key to understanding why George wants to tear down that house in the first place. I liked the fact that during the first half of the film, Sam is resentful and only capable of half-listening to his father because he is dying for a fix or a private place to.....ahem.  Slowly, those needs fall by the wayside as he really starts to HEAR what his father is trying to tell him.  And what is he trying to tell him?  That it's never too late to find happiness and love....that rebuilding your life and relationships is possible and worth it.Aah, but the irony of life.  You finally reconnect with your father, you begin to love him again and then you find out he's going to die.  What a cosmic mind f*** that is!  But it happens (something similar happened to me) and of course Sam would see that as another betrayal, another abandonment. Kline and Christensen nail their acting nominations with this climactic scene.  The hesitant mutual reaching out, the son's sudden profane anger, the father's understanding, the son again running away only to collapse on his friend's staircase in tears.  Brilliant.  Simply brilliant.Hell, I could go on and on about this film, but I want you to see it for yourself.This is truly a gem of a film, one that unflinchingly explores dysfunctional families and all the trauma that goes with it, yet somehow ends on a triumphant note.

I dont really see all the similarities to american beauty except for the drugs and a guy losing his job.  It basically ends at that.  The only reason i would say this movie was similar is that it was the most incredible movie ive seen in a while.  I loved a beautiful mind, but this was def the BEST picture. It has some real characters in it.  The way love and family and abuse backgrounds are handled is very believeable and well thought out.  The story is wonderful, and the acting is incredible!  Hayden Christianson is very good in this.  His character is so incredibly dynamic its amazing to watch. In the beginging of the movie i thought he was just mumbling his lines cuz he wasnt a good actor, but by the end he starts smiling and speaking up, it is a really nice change!  Im looking more forward to Star Wars now, knowing that they put anakins character in the hands of a good actor that may very well become someone we will always remember (and i dont mean as anakin) this kid is going to go places.  Kevin Kline is great as always.  This movie has it all, you WILL laugh, and smile, and frown, and cry (cry a lot) if you dont, then you are not human and you have no emotions or have never felt anything.

I'm not usually a big Kevin Kline fan, Kristin Scott Thomas is WAY too scrawny, and who in the world is Hayden Christensen? (Yes, I live in a cave and didn't know until I looked up info on Life that Mr. Christensen is the next Anakin Skywalker - I have a 4-year-old and don't get out much).SPOILERS COMING UPWhat a movie, though.  I had no pre-conceived notions about Hayden Christensen - I was blown away by his performance.  The change in his character from Goth to (kind of) normal I feel occurred in the 2nd, ahem, shower scene.  You can see Sam's beginning self-awareness of the power to bring pleasure to another person surge through his body, especially the shot through the shower door - tentative kiss to commanding, no other physical contact to full-body embrace.  Come on, we've all been there, totally unsure until we realize, hey, this is pretty great, and the other person seems to be into it too.  With Christensen's good looks, I think it's safe to say he's not so inexperienced in real life, but I was totally convinced of it in his portrayal of Sam.  I'm usually way turned off by seemingly gratuitous sex in movies, but this was truly a character-defining moment.Speaking of which, I could have done without seeing Mary Steenburgen naked. Great actresses like her shouldn't feel the need to get stark naked.Kline and Scott-Thomas were both admirable in their roles, but the movie really belonged to Christensen.  I'm (ouch) 34 years old, and I watched the movie a 2nd and 3rd time, but fast forwarded over the grown-ups parts to see Christensen again.  Maybe Christensen reminds me too much of a guy I knew in high school, the rebel who's really crying for help, a kid caught up in circumstances that are beyond what a kid should have to handle, even if he brought the trouble upon himself.  What 16 year old wants to feel like he has to partially asphyxiate himself in order to deal with his life, or sees homosexual prostitution as a quick way to make money to feed a drug habit?I was dreading my husband dragging me to see Star Wars Episode 2, but now I can hardly wait to see Christensen perform again.Overall, nothing spectacular - just a good, quiet story - no over-done explosions (real or emotional).

Hayden Christensen plays a drug-addicted teenager trying to find his place in life.  Kristin-Scott Thomas is the concerned mother who doesn't know what to do.  Mary Steenburgen is the sex-crazed mother with a genuine heart and Jena Malone is the pseudo-Lolita; who uses a seduction method far beyond compare. The film did have some very disturbing scenes.  Like the scene where Christensen pays the older man to perform fellatio on him for a bag of weed and the scene where Steenburgen and Malone's boyfriend have sexual intercourse.  When we find out who the man is that violated Christensen it brings with it an icy sense of shock.  But as in the Hollywood of old all the characters trials and tribulations seem to vanish and we come out with a happy ending.

It has it all - the drama, the acting, the screenplay, the emotions, the family dynamics... you name it.I was ambivalent about seeing this film initially because I thought that it'd just be another weepy family drama - the kind that draws in modest crowds but exploits our empathy.  Not so with this one.  I was truly impressed at how the screenwriter orchestrated the relationships to illustrate how families fall apart and how (in one way) they can reunite, despite such tragedy as an imminent death as the catalyst for drama and change to occur.All the acting was brilliant - especially Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen.  Kline's father character showed the sublime pain that he'd lived with for years because of the emotional cutoff and disconnectedness from his family.  Christensen (who I'm certain will be a household name sooner than later) revealed just the purity and intensity the range of emotions can be and is for a son who's estranged from his father and living out the impact of such devastation of abandonment.  They way their relationship is repaired is nothing short of amazing and is not glossed over because it's a Hollywood picture.  No, there's strife, anger, pain, remorse, guilt, shame, hurt, and joy wrapped up in these characters' journeys and although the reparation that takes place is Hollywood, you wouldn't know it by watching it.  I only wish we could all put down our pride like Kline and Christensen do in order to have the relationship they ended up having after so many years of pride and anger separating them.I would recommend this movie as an absolute MUST for anyone who has a relationship that needs repair or who wants a keener understanding of the dynamics of relationships between fathers and sons.  This will definitely be a movie I recommend to my patients and one I will come back to over and over again.  Timeless!!!!!  And, need I say anything about the locale of Laguna Beach????  Wow...

Some of the gags were really kinda dumb (like the thing with the dog and the neighbor) and the subplots were unnecessary (like Josh banging Elaine's mom). But, the movie's saving grace was the acting. Kevin Kline did a fantastic job and saved a lot of potentially corny and stupid moments and made them work and seem realistic. Hayden Christensen was equally amazing as Sam. He turned the one dimensional role of the angst teen on drugs into someone who turned to that behavior for a specific reason. There are fantastic scenes where we can see how much pain that Sam is in. Also, the transformation was amazing too.

In fact, I am glad that he did not receive a nomination for best actor over any of the other nominees.  The film itself was mediocre.  I personally do not like  it when completely unrealistic character changes occur in a film.  In this film numerous characters changed, all for the better, in a very short time period.

It is not as visually stunning as American Beauty, but the lack of slickness works for the stories and the characters.  They are, after all, real people.

I discovered the best movie I've seen in a year and I see A LOT of movies. I walked out of Ocean's Eleven, A Beautiful Mind and Lord Of The Rings. In one way or another, I'd seen them all before. Life As A House had me reduced to a sniveling, awe-struck confidante of each character in one hour. I cried for the second hour and there is no lying about that. I can't really say anything brilliant about the direction, except that the director clearly commanded supreme performances from his cast. Otherwise, the direction was mute and I'm not saying that is a bad thing. He didn't scream, I am the director!. He let his cast do it. Kevin Kline is amazingly metamorphic. Kristen Scott Thomas (and her character because you can see her in her character and that's not a bad thing)is perfectly cast and extremely endearing. Hayden Christensen is not only exactly terse and pained as Sam, he IS Sam. I look forward to his Anakin like I never imagined before. What a well-kept and timely Vancouver discovery! Jena Malone blew me away in Contact and Bastard Out Of Carolina and she has matured into a true starlet. I've always liked Mary Steenburgen, but never really cared about her characters until now.

I think the beauty of this film is metaphoric in the purest form The building of a house, in the place where it was, creates a new house from the ashes/splinters of the first. A phoenix. The celebration of the birth of renewed relationships from the fragmented shards of the past. I just cannot say enough about how much this film slayed me and, after some really stinky films lately, I'm glad to have my ardent love for film finally reinforced by a surprisingly overlooked jewel like this tear-jerking, complex and totally engaging conglomerate of very gifted film makers, actors, writers, producers and angels. I eagerly await ownership of Life As A House. "},{"Title":"This movie was amazing!","Date":"2 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I absolutely loved this movie.

The movie was put together so well but i dont think that it got very much recognition. People thought it was an old people movie but it was totally for everyone.

However, this is probably the best movie I have seen all year, and I've seen a lot.  Kevin Kline gave a stunning performance, as he always does, being extremely funny and sarcastic one minute, to totally serious and tear-jerking the next.  Hayden Christensen was the perfect choice to play the rebellious son--I've never seen him act before this, but I can't imagine any body else bringing so much emotion to the silver screen.  Kristin Scott Thomas wasn't as thrilling as the others, but then again, her role wasn't supposed to stand out as much.

I was not going to see this movie as it received rather cold reviews, but as it managed to maintain an 8,0 average on imdb.com I felt I had to give it a chance. I think I understand both the critics and the audience. If you want to see a real tear-jerker this year, this is probably as satisfactory as they come. This is one of the most touching movies I have seen, and yet I cannot allow myself to praise it too much. It is touching, yes, but in order to become touching it is quite manipulative. It gets to a point where it is a little too obvious that the filmmakers want you to cry. Also some of the plot points are far from original. For instance, a big part of this movie evolves around building a house. It would be really satisfying to have seen this being done without the mandatory and surprising obstacle that must be overcome near the end when everything seemed to be going well. With a little bit more brains, this film could have been really good.Aside from this, Kevin Kline is as always doing a great job, but the surprise of the movie is Hayden Christensen in his first significant role. Yes, this is the guy who landed the Anakin Skywalker part for Episode II. There is no doubt in my mind that Episode II will be a bad movie just like Episode I, but George Lucas did at least get an extremely talented newcomer to play Darth Vader. His role in Life as House is so honest and strong that it almost carries the film alone.

What makes is a good movie is the cast. All of the major players are solid, and Kline and Scott-Thomas are excellent. In fact, I think that Kline is better than excellent. He manages to play the stock I'm dying but I'm going to make everything okay character as a self-centered jerk (all of the backstory for this character makes is clear that this is what he has always been). It could have been a much better movie if the realistic consequences of his behavior had been reflected on the screen, and if they had included some scenes where he acted out his anger and fear, but the script wanted him to be a guy who finds instant wisdom and restraint upon learning that he's dying (remember, TV movie).Kline is likable, so having him play a villain wouldn't be popular with the audience, but he is a also an intelligent and subtle actor when given the chance, and in this case I'm inclined to believe that he gave such a performance in spite of the movie (the script didn't provide much help), rather than because of it. (Note his first scene at work, where he's doing the grass. As written, it should be a this is an unappreciated craftsman piece of junk. As played, it's I'm self-indulgent and difficult. Similarly the scene that comes later with the models as he's leaving is more nuanced than the trite I'm standing up for myself after all these years junk that it was probably written to be.)I look forward to the DVD since I would like to try to figure out who was a party to fixing the script as well as it was.I sniffled at all of the manipulative parts just like the people around me, but I recommend it as more than just a hanky movie. What's sad is that this amazing cast should have been saddled with this cliched script.

Kevin Kline plays George, who makes models of buildings at an architectural firm. They want him to learn to use a computer, so he runs around the office with a sticking smashing up all the models he has made over the years.  Then he runs outside and falls on the ground, and then suddenly he's dying of cancer.  It's cancer of something unspecified and he doesn't seem to be sick, or getting any medical treatment.  Instead he decides to build a house. Now here is a man who in all his healthy years has been too lazy to even paint the shack he lives in, but now that he's dying, he's all full of energy to build a whole dream house. He enlists the help of his rebellious teenage son, who is a suicidal drug user gay prostitute. George uses tough love and tells the son to stop using eye makeup. Suddenly, the boy is dating girls, dressing like a J. Crew ad, and helping to build the house.  When the cancer patient is not busy building a house, he is busy diving off a cliff into the cold ocean to take a swim.  His ex-wife comes by to visit all the time.  She is played by Kirsten Scott Thomas, an actress who is so emaciated that every bone in her head shows. The wife sighs and tells George he is getting so thin.  It's hilarious- there is Kevin Kline, as pleasantly plump as always, but wearing a kind of loose T-shirt.  And there she is, truly looking like a cancer patient. Casting???  Then there's some business about the neighbor lady bonking her daughter's boyfriend.  A movie like The Graduate spends most of the movie building up to such a thing- here it is a throwaway plot burst, totally unaccounted-for. This movie is a hoot!

His ex-wife, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas) is living with her new husband and children, one of whom is the introvert, troubled teenage son Sam (Hayden Kristen) who is into drugs. George, now unemployed and confused, decides to tear his shack down and build a house. He also wishes to heal his relationships with the people around him, mostly with his teenage son, Sam, who is forced to spend a month in his father's place while he is  building the house. George's next door neighbour is an oversexed woman whom he has dated before. Her equally oversexed daughter, who is already going to same school with Sam gets a chance to get close to him once he starts his father's shack. One of George's neighbour is quite angry with George's dog who constantly p****s on his car or morning paper. It doesn't take long since George's last project starts to change the lifes of others around him.What I liked This is a very well done movie in which human emotions are conveyed very realistically through good performances, best of which comes from Hayden Christensen who plays Sam; Hayden Christensen was really the best part of the movie and he really deserves an Oscar nomination. He is very natural and does an excellent job of portraying a troubled, confused teenager kid who is introvert but willing to open up if approached in the right way. His latent potential of giving and receiving love starts to surface during the project of building the new house. Screenplay is highly sophisticated, successfully portraying many diverse characters who become involved with another. The scenes are nicely shot and quite stylish. What I didn't like There isn't really much that I disliked about Life As A House although you may find building a new house for a man who is dying not very logical. I also think that Robin's husband's character was hastily established for he changed so fast from displaying one character to another.I enjoyed every moment of Life As A House and I think it is one of the best movies of the year; I highly recommend it. If you like inspiring dramas such as The Ice Storm and American Beauty, the chances you will enjoy Life As A House is very high.Possible Oscar Nominations Hayden Christensen (Best Supporting Actor), Kevin Cline (Best Leading Actor), The Best Picture, The Best Director, The Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography.

Would you spend your precious time dealing with the sudden, shocking news? Would you fall into webs of depression and despair? Or would you take advantage of the time you had and accomplish the things you've always wanted to do? Irwin Winkler's Life as a House asks us these questions, and while the movie's final outcome is inevitable, the end of the road isn't the topic here. It's the journey itself that makes this trip worthwhile.  Life as a House does recycle material from other movies, most obviously from American Beauty, but that's beside the point. This treasure of a motion picture creates something beautiful and uplifting, who cares where the ideas came from. It reminds us that there are very few original ideas out there, but that does not mean derived ideas cannot inspire an effective production.  While the film has opened to some mediocre reviews and may find itself swept under the rug with competition like Monsters, Inc. and Harry Potter, Life as a House blows most of this year's best films out of the water. It connects with audiences like no other production I have seen all year.The film stars Kevin Kline as George, a bland name for a bland character. Much like American Beauty's center character, George hates his career, his lifestyle, and the disconnection with his family. His ex-wife (Kristen Scott Thomas), now married to a materialistic moneybags (Jamie Sheridan), struggles daily with her rebellious, drug-addicted teenage son, Sam (Hayden Christenen). These are not happy people, and the movie never pretends otherwise. Suddenly, everything changes for George. He is fired from his job-not necessarily a bad thing-then learns he has terminal cancer-a bad thing. He instantly wakes up to his current situation, and decides to spend his final months building. As an experienced architect, he cashes his life insurance policy to tear down his old shack and build the house of his dreams. In the process, he hopes to rebuild various relationships within his family.   Life as a House might sound like a gentle, touching fable of self-redemption, but it's often quite harsh. Mark Andrus' screenplay gives the material a hard edge. The opening scenes feature indecent exposure, urination, and disturbing drug content. Although this is not your typical Irwin Winkler film, he does use the edgy content to grab us by the collar and pull us in.With credits like As Good as it Gets, Andrus has a reputation for solid writing, and his talents show through here. He uses many conventional Hollywood devices, but they work surprisingly well. It steadily builds enough emotional tension to cut with a knife. By the end of this movie, the characters feel so real, the dialogue so sincere, the themes so universal, the issues so personal, and the performances so inspiring, I wished I would have brought a box of tissues into the theater with me.It's one thing to admire the emotional grasp of a movie, but it's another when we become so intently involved in a movie that it triggers a real emotional response. Life as a House is a powerful, moving, poignant, and unforgettable feature. It's the season's most encouraging treat.

Kevin Kline is an old-world architect that doesn't use cad when bldng. He constructs models of structures in scale, but one day finds himself out paced by the pc. Throughout the firm beautiful models of his creations abound, he is only allowed to take one, and he does just that, leaving none behind. He is diagnosed with an illness and goes back to a shack in front of the ocean next to upper-middle class neighbors. Hayden lives with his mon and his well off step-dad. A normal young guy, smoking grass, into the underground scene with piercings and a cool streak of blue on his jet black hair. He arrives to school with Brandon in a Porche planning extra curricular activities. Kevin wants to be with his son during this summer, and forcefully gets Hayden from the step-dads home to spend the summer with him. Arguing that he's only sixteen, Hayden act too mature to be sixteen, but then fluctuates his demeanor, as emotional scenes become of him, and pulls aces from his sleeve as a young adult. At the shack Kevin Kline shakes actors by the shoulders. He suffers his disease, he comforts his son. He re-evaluates and makes amends wth his ex-wife, to the the point that they fall in love again. Kevin and Hayden destroy the shack with crowbars and hammers, to begin the dream of bldng the house he always wanted with the help of his family. The girl next door and Hayden slowly become an item and soon all get to participate in bldng the house. A neighbor starts trouble but skeletons in the closet bring his plans to a halt. The part of the film which construction of the house took place left me void. I wish Kevin and Hayden participated in working on the floor plans of the home, I can imagine them bonding even more if this phase occurred. I saw the house being constructed, but never really felt its presence. Nevertheless, I went thru many emotions in this amazing film. Many times I put my hands in my face, embarrassed at the film exposing us so openly. The adults are mirror images of our parents, but at the same time it makes us feel for them, and tells us that one day we will have kids too and we are going to want their ears to mold them healthy, wealthy and wise. I dont think I've ever been to a film with such a good message for this era, that doesnt preach, but teach. I think it was Kevin Kline who made it happen, his performance is beyond acting. This film is awesome, I hope the youth who do things young people do, experience it and concluding the picture leave the theater more mature and more adult, this is the real America beauty of cinema.

This movie is trying to be American Beauty, and while I'm not the biggest American Beauty fan, I will say in it's defense that it's at least consistently at addressing it's taboo themes in it's strange almost surreal way. Life as a House has it's share of taboo issues, but they are solved much too easily or never really addressed at all.The only thing that saves this movie is it's cast, who all rise above their dull material. Kevin Kline is a great dramatic actor, and you will feel for him. Hayden Christenson is very good at portraying the troubled teen Sam, and I am defiantly looking forward to seeing him in Star Wars next summer. The supporting cast is very good also.

I loved Melrose Place, but a drama should not also try to be camp TV! Anyway, the architect's son ends up sleeping with the neighbor Mrs Robinson-style. The woman had at one time dated Kevin Kline's character. The woman's daughter also has a habit of undressing, and showering with the son, then trying out a Lolita type thing with the architect which he mercifully does not reciprocate!

But it succeeds when it does not attempt to imitate it so obviously (like about half of the script and the casting of Scott Bakula and Sam Robards in minor roles). Kevin Kline too rapidly goes from being a disaffected professional to a dying man trying desperately to rebuild his house and reconnect with his son.  He becomes saintly almost overnight. His son's transformation from a Marilyn Manson-addicted, drug-addicted pain-in-the-ass teenager to a more normal teen is somewhat more believable.  Both Kline and Hayden Christenson were excellent.This is a worthwhile movie, but not a great movie.

Kevin Kline, in his best performance ever, plays George, a middle-aged man who has done nothing most of his lifetime, devoting such little time to his family that his own son Sam (played marvelously by newcomer Hayden Christensen) despises him. When he learns that he has terminal cancer and that his life grows shorter by the day, he becomes dedicated to make a change in the way he has lived his life. He tells his ex-wife that he wishes to have their son spend the entire summer with him, helping him to construct the dream house he always said that he'd finishing building someday. At first, Sam is reluctant to stay with him in the old rickety shack that he lives in, but with his old man's steadfast determination to not give up on him and the help of a pretty next door neighbor, it is not long before Sam and his father begin to form a bond that will not only change both their lives, but ultimately, reunite their family.Life As A House is a wonderful family drama that older teenagers need to watch with their parents. It is the kind of film that aims to show audiences what life and love is really all about. Its even quite funny in parts. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.

Was it manipulating my emotions or was it well written and touching me more deeply than many other films?

"},{"Title":"Home improvement","Date":"15 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Life as a House is an imperfect movie with noble aspirations about imperfect people with noble aspirations.In his best role in years, Kevin Kline plays George Monroe, a middle-aged man whose life is in ruins. Estranged from his remarried ex-wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) and his miserably rebellious teenage son (Hayden Christensen), he lives in the ramshackle house he inherited from his father.On the day he's fired from his job, George collapses and wakes up in a hospital. The news is not good. Faced with a very brief future, he decides to tear down the shack he's been living in and rebuild it by hand.George sees this major feat of home improvement as a last chance to bond with his angry, pot-smoking, glue-sniffing son, but the integrity of his task ultimately attracts and transforms everyone in George's life.Although it's the type of movie that Frank Capra might've directed Jimmy Stewart in sixty years ago, there's a raw frankness to the film that both balances and battles with its misty-eyed nobility.Screenwriter Mark Andrus (As Good as it Gets) navigates the rocky waters between quirky comedy and heart-tugging sentimentality with mixed results. For every scene of emotional truth there's a moment of only-in-the-movies contrivance, and major self-revelations tend to just drop out of the characters' mouths.Director/Producer Irwin Winkler (The Net) strikes a good balance between comedy and drama, and is especially adept at drawing strong performances from his actors.Although Life as a House lacks the cinematic finesse of American Beauty (which it occasionally resembles), it's hard not to love - or at least admire -  the film for what it does accomplish.The film is boldly unashamed of its central metaphor of the house that (like its inhabitants' relationships) must be torn down to be rebuilt again. And let's face it, how many Hollywood film-makers even know what a metaphor is?While characters in most Hollywood movies are either aggressively lovable or just plain bad, there's a complex imperfection to each of this film's central characters. George is an endearing misfit who let his own childhood scars prevent him from being the husband and father he could've been.Kline's Oscar-caliber performance is filled with multi-layered nuance. He and Scott Thomas beautifully portray the estranged couple who are all too aware of the mistakes they've made along with way.As their troubled son Sam, Christensen is simply terrific, showing the pain and vulnerability beneath his teenage rage. The evolution of this father-son relationship is the heart of the film and the two actors never hit a false note.Christensen will soon be immortalized, as movie star and action figure, playing Annakin Skywalker - the boy who will be Vader - in Star Wars II The Attack of the Clones. The starwars.com website has omitted Life as a House (in which his character sells his body for drugs) from the actor's resume.Despite its flaws, including more subplots and conflicts than it can effectively resolve, the film is both worthy and worth seeing for its incisive depiction of imperfect but very human relationships.

Like the writer's previous film, As Good As It Gets, characters here say inane things they would never say in reality and do even stupider things just to please the pen of the writer.  For example, teenage girl jumps naked into shower with teenage boy and then proclaims that they should just be friends. Character loses job and begins to destroy the office in retaliation. These and other countless scenes of contrivance may make for a fairly entertaining movie, but they only add incredulity to an already pretentious story and add nothing to a real life experience.Hayden Christensen plays the son of Kevin Kline, an architect, just fired from a job he's had for 25 years.  Dad insists that his son join him for the summer so that he can wean him from his problems and bring back that father and son closeness. We soon learn that there is more to why Dad wants him around than he first lets on.The best parts of the film are the performances, all of which shine, despite the pretensions and herky-jerky sentimentalities the film rams down our throats.

It is the first in a nearly disastrous suffusion of condescending aphorisms that melt through this wet tissue of a movie.Which is not to say that it is not without it's charms, nor a few frank and honest glimpses into the suffering yet endurance of human emotion.  The pandering is heartily supported and thankfully eclipsed by unexpectedly brilliant performances from this entire ensemble cast.Kevin Kline plays the role of George, adopting all of the colloquial proverbs and afflicted house analogies that come with the territory.  He subsists through his ramshackle life in a ramshackle house built at cliff's edge at the end of an oceanscape cul-de-sac, surrounded by affluent neighbors and beautiful houses, neither of which appreciate George's presence.  His correlation to the pathetic domicile quickly takes an ironic twist when we learn that George is an architect, perhaps even a good one. Just as quickly, he loses his job over his ornery adherence to antiquated ways in the same day that he is diagnosed with cancer and promised a mere four months to live.  Insert stiff and overcooked affectation here life built on a shaky foundation, life without proper support, etc.As with any expiring character in any movie, George is instantly wrought with the notion to extend his life, not in days but in his nobility of character and the profound distinction of a changed man.  He seeks enlightenment in reconciliation with his estranged son Sam (Hayden Christensen - a.k.a. the future Anakin Skywalker) who lives with his mother, George's ex-wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), and seeks refuge from reality in a steady procession of household whippits, prescription valium, and amateur prostitution, not necessarily in that order.  This obviously can best be accomplished by forcing the son to help demolish the dilapidated ruin of a house and build a new one in its stead. The execution proves as emotionally challenging as it is physically, for the main character all but sings the crisp and clean parallel this has to the legacy of his own overbearing father.  Tear down a memory, build a relationship.  Yes, it really can be that simple.This movie is good, but for all the wrong reasons.  Irwin Winkler as director far overshot the tear-rousing goal, which suggests that he absorbed nothing from his last time at the helm, the whiny and ineffectively sappy `At First Sight'.  The predictable home movies are unveiled during the waning moments of George's life because you can only truly weigh a character's heavy heart by seeing how happy he used to be, right?  And a rapid and all-too-neat tying of loose ends in the last five minutes, complete with schmaltzy voice-over narration, is a poor attempt to make you forget that Kleenex was the unofficial sponsor.  Subplots involving the promiscuous mother next door (Mary Steenburgen) and a persistent building inspector, both used as comic relief, are ill-used and off-the-mark.`Life As a House' has trouble escaping the shadow of 1999's `American Beauty', a film which wove richly-embedded and superb acting with a raw sympathy for loneliness, and the similarities seem almost intentional. `Life As a House' however, while maintaining the consummate quality of drama, preys mercilessly on the audiences emotions and likely will not become this autumn's Oscar sleeper.  Go see this movie, but bring your best hanky and hug someone afterward.

Wham, the federal gift tax applies, calculated at the same rates. The son would have had the liability. I know most people won't be bothered by this, but, if you're a financial planner, then, just as you are wiping your eyes at the end, you will say, Aw, hell, that couldn't happen!  Unless you want to believe the IRS could get caught up in the emotion of the moment -- naw.  I agree with the other reviewers that the actors did a fine job here.

For starters it was overacted, incredibly sappy, & very predictable.  It was your basic rebellious-son-hates-father, father-gets-cancer, son-and-father-bond-while-building-a-house movie.  It's right out of a Lifetime movie.  The only difference is, it's not breast cancer George contracts, but rather prostate cancer.  But crappy acting & easy predictability aside, the worst part of Life As A House is the extreme sexual tensions that plague every single character of this damn movie! It's awful!  There was several random scenes where two characters would be in bed together (a couple of times they were youths & adults), but that would be it- just one single scene!  Then you'd cut to scenes of all the characters at the building site erecting this silly house as if they were one big incestuous family.  It was really creepy & discordant.  Oh yeah, & Kristen Scot Thomas' character had the worst scene in the movie- it was where she pretty much left her husband & just told him that she fell in love again with George her ex.

A goth Anakin Skywalker!I don't want to damn this film with faint praise - I enjoyed it (I'm an incurable romantic, so it would be hard not to) but I thought it was a little derivative and hokey. When you see a really good play or film you might remark - wow! the whole was really more than the sum of its parts! I liked this film, but it would be more like hmmm - the sum of the parts was really more than the whole.I thought the individual and interactive performances were good - but the situations the actors were put in seemed at times contrived. Robert Ebert wrote a review in which he said When the levers and pulleys of the plot are concealed by good writing and acting we get great entertainment like TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. When they're fairly well masked we get sincere films like ONE TRUE THING.I'd say LIFE AS A HOUSE falls in between.I did feel echoes of TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. Perhaps a few flickers of AMERICAN BEAUTY. But it took a while before it hit me that this was pretty much a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1952 IKIRU (almost a 50th anniversary tribute!) But as Goethe said Everything's been thought of before;the trouble is to think of it again. Or, to be semi-facetious If you're gonna steal, steal from the best.I thought Jena Malone (Alyssa) did a good job - I don't think I've seen a film with her in it since she played young Ellen in CONTACT. Hayden Christensen looks to be a contender. Kevin Kline did quite well. Kristin Scott Thomas didn't have as much to work with as she did in THE ENGLISH PATIENT but she made what she was given work. (The actor playing Peter was hardly given anything to work with).But I'd say it's definitely worth seeing. And if you like it, you might want to give IKURU a chance. Maybe you're not into foreign films. Maybe black & white with subtitles is not your idea of a good time. And maybe the story plot was first told a millennia or two ago near a fire where people were trying to get warm so Kurosawa wasn't the first to tell the story either!But it's held up well over 50 years, methinks. Unless you're near a major cinema center or university with a film society or Asian film studies you probably won't be able to see IKURU on the big screen (where it really should be seen) but Amazon.com has VHS copies from about $20-$25.LIFE AS A HOUSE was good. I'd recommend it with the reservations listed above. If you can, see IKURU also.

George, Kevin Klein's character, is living a miserable life when the movie begins. He is divorced from his ex-wife who he still loves; estranged from his 16 year-old son, who is unhappy and using drugs; and hates his home, a shack on a beautiful cliff in Malibu. Then one day George visits his ex-wife, who asks him to take their son, Sam, for the summer; loses his job; and finds out he has only a few months to live. George decides to tear down the shack, which his dad willed to him and he hates, and build a house he'll be proud to give his son. He tells his ex he'll take Sam for the summer, so that they can help each other, and tells no one of his cancer. The scenery and cinematography in this movie alone make it worth seeing. There are breathtaking scenes from the cliff in Malibu, as well as from the ex-wife's back yard; and that's where most of the movie takes place. The story may not be a new one, but it is beautiful. There are some seemingly unnecessary sub-plots I could've done without, and some of the characters needed more depth or explanation, but the main characters feel like people you've known for years. The acting is wonderful. This movie is a little over 2 hours, but does not drag throughout, a big feat considering it's a drama, and doesn't try to be anything more. This movie won't challenge you, but would be nice for a quite evening out; it needs to be seen on a big screen. I recommend it.

Though, I found there to be many things that were somewhat unnecessary in the film that didn't add much or didn't need to be in the film. Some of them were quite awkward. Things such as Alyssa taking showers with Sam after only a few visits (her not really knowing him). Colleen (Allyssa's mother) sleeping with Josh (Alyssa's boyfriend). Alyssa later on kissing George (she said that he looked like a good-kisser??). I also didn't like the ending with the narration of Kevin Kleine's voice-over, also the family giving the house (that they spent a lot of time building) to the little crippled girl.

I work hard, I love, I laugh - but there's something not right. A lack of identity perhaps? Or maybe a lack of purpose? Or are those one and the same? This is about a man who has been living a life he's hated. Most of his life has been wasted. In face of death, he decides to stop being, and to start living. He decides to give himself purpose - to do something for himself, and for the people he cares about. It is like a dream. The beautiful sunsets over the ocean and the pink and orange sky that fill the film are like a painting. We too often dull our lives. Whether it is killing our souls with the routine of a job you hate, or escaping reality by abusing drugs, many of us live lives we dislike because it is often too hard to do the right and good thing. It is easy to procrastinate. It is easy to stand aside in fear. Even when your wife leaves you, and your son cuts you off. It is hard to stop doing what you 'have' to do in order to do what you want to do - what you need to do. This is your life, and it is ticking away. I'm not saying you must quit your job to enjoy life. But if you can't enjoy life because of your job - then change now, because otherwise you will just keep living for your job while your life falls away until there is nothing left but your job.In face of death, George (Kevin Kline - the best I've ever seen him) finally realizes that he can make life worth living. Not just for himself - but for his son, and for others around him. The great shame is that he realizes this so late in his life. A wonderful movie. It takes you, the viewer, and makes you think about how you are putting off your life. How you are always delaying. You absorb yourself in work, and school, and drugs, and video games, and whatever else. Life is passing you by.

This is really and excellent movie that has a lot to offer.The critics were a little hard on Life as a House, when it was release back in 2001, and I don't buy their reasoning. There was the complaint that, not even at the half way point, the viewer will be able to guess how the movie ends. This might have some truth to it, however that virtually does not diminish its quality at all. There are plenty of movies where we can accurately predict the outcome, but does that make us not want to see how they get there? Not at all. I'm sure anyone would guess that James Bond and Superman will save the day in their respective movies, but, for some reason it matters less for people watching those titles.Without giving anything away or going into detail, then all I can say is that this picture does not disappoint. It's everything you should expect; a touching drama about life, family, and personal struggle. The characters are deep and the acting, especially Kevin Kline, is at least near first rate.If you enjoyed American Beauty, then I'd say is a nice reflection of that genre.

Hayden Christensen's (may the force be with him) character Sam, goes from trying to hang/suffocate/drug himself to death (What kind of mother, when seeing this, would just leave and shut the door behind her and not do anything about it?), to being tricked to love his dad. I would have to say if I could have chosen an actor who I think would be ideal for this part, I would have chosen Shane West, because he did such a great job playing the bad boy/conflict with father role in A Walk to Remember. (Of course the people who hire the cast wouldn't have known this because A Walk to Remember came out one year later-I'm just saying, we have seen that he can do it.) These days I think he could have done a much more convincing job than Christensen, who so many people now know as little Ani. Jena Malone's character Alyssa goes from showering with Sam, to kissing George, then kissing Sam some more, and sleeping in the same bed with him. And I have to ask, what kind of mother would allow her - what? 16 or 17 year old(?) daughter do this?

He played a totally believable miserable teen with a lot of inner problems. In a way his character, Sam, and his father, Kevin Kline as George, are similar in the sense that they both are alone. Sam purposely shoves away affection and his family. George lives by himself as a divorced man. At one point he tells a nurse that he hadn't been touched warmly by another person, family or friend, in years.I've always enjoyed watching Kevin Kline but in this film, he was different. I'm used to a more comical and happier character portrayal. Here, he is miserable and alone. I think that, from what I'm used to seeing from him, this was perhaps one of his best performances.At first, it is a little slow moving, but it picks up. I found it sad to believe that the mother had absolutely no control over her son. Kline and Christensen were good together. A father trying to find love from his son before he dies and keeping that from his family for so long shows that he wasn't so much selfish as he was selfless. It is very easy for someone to regret not patching problems up with a friend or a loved one before it was too late. His decision to build a house was what saved he and his family.It was a good, sweet film that I recommend to anyone with family issues, even minor ones.

My informant was not wrong. Firsly, i look to Kevin Kline. Being only 16, i was not familiar with this actor. However, i am now well aware that he is one of the greats. This was an outstanding performance, which was realistic and absorbing. However, i feel that he was outshone on the screen by one actor...Kristen Scott Thomas. Kristen was a familiar face, as i knew him from his whining portrayal of the young Anakin Skywalker (though i still anticipate episode III). And, when he appeared to be in the role of another 'suffering teen', i was resigned to the fact that i would have to bear his forced tears. However, he pleasantly surprised me. Not only did he pull off a series of emotions, he was a likable character. I actually felt for him, and he brought an enigmatic presence to each and every scene he was in!! LIFE AS A HOUSE is a wonderfully made film. It portrays the lives of a man and his family wonderfully, and i would gladly watch it again!

A man is dying of cancer and wants to spend time with his son, who rarely speaks to him and spends most of his time getting high or locked in his room. After his divorce from his wife, he has been basically living in a shack that he inherited from his father. The man gets laid off from his job as an architect (after throwing a fit) and decides to tear the shack down and build a new house on where the shack stood with his son, who is uninterested in the project but later joins in and falls in love with the neighbor girl.Unfortunately, this film (which was compared by many to American Beauty, one of my personal favorites) was very average and extremely melodramatic. The score seems to cue how the audience is supposed to feel, so you know exactly what what the mood of the scene is. The plot itself is very predictable, and Hayden Christiansen's character Sam is little more than an one-dimensional stereotype, and is essentially the same character the actor played in Star Wars Episode II (though it was the only mar to the film acting wise). The movie lost me after the multiple hissy fits Sam throws.Though Life as a House has it's funny moments, it tries too hard to tug at the viewer's heart strings and could have been much better. Unlike American Beauty, it is sappy and frustrating.

Hayden Christensen, his repugnant teenage son, is reinvigorated by his last Summer with his dying Father and Kristin Scott-Thomas, Mother and ex-wife, tragically re-discovers her former love for the dying Kline.This is a film that bears watching at least twice, if not more. Kevin Kline's charm and sincerity is always very watchable, but that of the son, played by Christensen, is such a mix of subtlety and intensity that it is truly electrifying. Watching his mood change from dark to light is acting at its best.Kristin Scott-Thomas is also very powerful as the Mother, torn between two husbands and families, ultimately striving her maternal hardest to rescue the best of a tragic situation. There are many touching moments between her and her children and Kline, as well as a sublime dance-scene set against the backdrop of a sun-filled sea with their brooding teenage son looking on and realising the power of family love.This film is supported by an excellent cast of characters and although it is sentimental in nature, manages to combine some welcome edginess as well as humour.There is perhaps one minor niggle; I would have liked to add a ceremony-scene towards the end, appropriately set in the grounds of the 'House', extending for a brief moment the sense of loss and achievement of Kline's character in bringing together the lives of his family and neighbours.Audiences must watch this film twice to begin to appreciate it. It is also blessed with a good soundtrack, which is so critical in amplifying the drama and ambient moments. I recommend it very highly - it deserved and still deserves a much wider audience.

I saw Attack of the Clones before I saw Life As A House, and I think that part of Christensen's skill as an actor is that he can be so aggravatingly whiny, although I'm not sure I would consider that a skill. His teenage angst came through fairly well in Life As A House, but he overacts so much that he is almost completely unconvincing.(spoilers) As a whole, the film is about overcoming old grudges and getting people back together, even if this reunion is the result only of an impending death. The obligatory happy ending is certainly noticeable, but it's not entirely unsatisfying. At the risk of sounding morbid, I'm glad that they didn't go so far as to find some sort of miracle sure for George (Kevin Kline), but instead let him pass on and have the rest of his characters accept his death and for his son to complete the mission that he set out to do.The painful growing of the relationship between George and his son was effectively portrayed, but weighted down only by the nerve-grating performance from Christensen. The film ends on a strong note in that it is not so weak as to have Sam, the son, give in completely and live happily ever after in his father's dream house, and even the sappy portion, giving the house as a gift to a woman who was the victim of a car accident in which George was involved years and years earlier, is not so sappy that it makes you roll your eyes and say here we go again as the movie switches to auto-pilot. There are so many people in our society that have been victims of any kind of unfortunate circumstance that it is good to see someone do something for them, even if only in the movies. Helping out those who are less fortunate is a powerful message for a Hollywood movie to deliver, and Life As A House does that, with only the most minor and excusable drawbacks.

Two of my favorites are Dave where he is a presidential look-alike, and French Kiss where he plays a Frenchman. He was even good in bad movies, like The Ice Storm.  Here, in Life As A House, he plays an architectural model-builder who still does each the old fashioned way, by hand, instead of using a computer and modern model-drawing software. That gets him fired, with a 26-week severance pay, and his bonus is news that he is dying from cancer.Meanwhile he is divorced 10 years and his teen-age son is totally impossible, angry, constantly taking or sniffing something to get high, wears makeup, has ear rings and a lower lip piercing, and a large swath of blue across his hear. Kline conceals his illness, says his pain-killers are for a bad back, and decides to tear down the house his father had given to him, really a shack among beautiful houses on a California bluff overlooking the Pacific, and build a new house while living in the detached garage.Kline forces his son to spend the summer with him, instead of going to Tahoe with friends, wanting to mend relationships before he dies. The title of the film comes from the metaphor of our lives we build around us are like a house we build, to get comfortable in. There are lots of angry scenes, lots of harsh language, son befriends young girl next door, eventually starts to break out of his shell, begins to help dad tear down old house, build new one. Dad dies, son and mom and others touched by his life become more aware of their own.Some of the criticism (e.g. Ebert) relates to all these characters having deep problems, and they all get resolved by the end of a two-hour movie. Well, I for one enjoy a movie where we are able to see salvation in the characters. Plus, you can't really make an 8-hour movie that tries to represent a longer transition. I don't really believe a son that angry and that out of control could become a model son over a summer, but it is a movie, after all, about a fictional story.  It is good entertainment, there are lots of funny scenes, and the acting is uniformly good. The overall message is true, the need to occasionally tear down our houses and build something fresh.The DVD is fine, and has a couple of very interesting making of specials.

His character George is still able to effectively use comic devices to deal with his physical pain and emotional turmoil. This may be a classic chick-flick &/or tear-jerker, but it has a special quality through the strength of the performances, the quality of the script and the stunning direction that make it just as much an enjoyable cinema experience as the 2001 version of The Deep End.The gay references and elements are handled well. Neither parent is concerned about George's possible sexuality (unlike the yobbos at his school) - rather they are concerned that he is not having a good time in life.

I have always enjoyed his range of characters and his ability to adapt to any role. As George Monroe, Kline portrays a worn-out, regretful man looking to do something right with the last few months of his life. His frustrations are honest and his passion is remarkable. Every line he speaks will captivate you.Hayden Christensen (Sam) shows that he has the talent that will make him a star. He plays the tormented and rebellious teenager with incredible poise and emotion. You truly feel he's living this character. His transformation into not only a likeable young man, but one with maturity and integrity is absolutely remarkable.There were many powerful moments in this story. I really enjoyed Kristin Scott Thomas as Robin and she worked really well with both George and Sam. Her embrace with Sam at the end looked so real, you can't help but fight back a tear.Because this film is honest about life and the frightening realities of it, this is not an easy story to swallow.

The antiquated mindsets of his parents got old pretty quick. The drug use and belligerence were bad, yes, but not the make-up, piercings and dyed hair. And when Jena Malone said, You look better without make-up, I kind of got a little nauseated.

Just to get my shallow thoughts out of the way, I thought the shower scenes with Hayden and Jena were both sexy and innocent, and Mary Steenbergen's affair with Jena's friend Josh (Ian Somerhalder) was hilariously inappropriate. I usually find Kristen Scott Thomas a very boring actress, but in this she was luminous. Kevin Kline gives another terrific performance as the man who, with the building of his dream house by the ocean, rebuilds his relationship with his son and ex-wife.

In fact, I could watch the movie again just to see his performance. Every word he says (even if it is a contrived revelation about living life to the fullest or something like that, which is the writer's fault, not his) oozes with humanity, and the scene in which he destroys his models after being fired will go down as one of my favorite scenes of all time...that's right... all time.

Living in a shack in a beautiful cliff side community overlooking the Pacific Ocean, he wants to tear it down and build his dreamhouse, just like Cary Grant's Mr. Blandings in that classic screwball comedy with Myrna Loy.Almost a male Terms of Endearment (and even The Miracle Worker with father being Annie Sullivan to the son's drug-addicted variation of Helen Keller), this overkills on emotional manipulation in spite of some superb performances, especially by Kevin Kline. Ex-wife Kristin Scott Thomas is stuck with an emotionally blank husband (Mike Weinberg) who believes any sign of parental affection leads to weakness and has caused his step-son (Hayden Christensen) to become emotionally distant and possibly incapable of forming any type of romantic attachment. The equally troubled Kline, already suffering a career nervous breakdown, seems the least likely candidate for curing the estranged son, but once the barriers are broken, the stage is set, especially thanks to the presence of a pretty young neighbor (Jena Malone) who has no qualms about joining Christensen naked in the shower of her mother's (Mary Steenburgen) house. A well-intended family drama, it suffers with too many emotionally troubled individuals and a manipulative effort to tug at the viewer's emotions. No one mood is sustained, and at times, the melodrama is almost comedic, which ultimately causes the screenplay to loose its focus and credibility. What is memorable is the movie's stunning photography which features breathtaking sunsets and ocean views. This leads to the film's breakthrough sequence between father and son where Kline, in a moment of desperation, jumps off the cliff into the ocean, as if to scare his son into revealing something other than the Marilyn Manson dour persona he's been impounded with throughout the first part of the movie.

The script itself is nothing special, but the actors make it touching and unique, the characters sympathetic and real. I thank this film for introducing me to one of Hollywood's best actors, Kevin Kline. His portrayal of George is nothing short of perfection. It makes me wish he was my dad. Jena Malone is hilarious and sweet as the flirtatious and Lolita-esque Alyssa. But the one who really shines here is Hayden Christensen. His performance as the troubled and angry Sam is moving. In the beginning he's just so cold and mean that you can't help but hate him. But as the film goes on you learn about the sense of abandonment and betrayal Sam feels at the hands of his father for leaving him alone with a detached and selfish step-dad who obviously is not fond of him. By the middle of the film Sam suddenly becomes vulnerable and opens up and you can't help but root for him and wish him success. And as a child from a divorced family I can definitely identify with him and understand his pain. For those who think Hayden is nothing more than a pretty face with no acting skills, I say watch this film and say that again. This is his best performance to date. Christensen and Kline have amazing father-son chemistry and their relationship in the film is presented beautifully.And I absolutely love how the drama in the film is balanced with comedy. At some points you might cry, but at others you will cry from laughing so hard.The Bad The sexuality here is good, to a certain point. It is a coming of age story so naturally there will be horny teenagers, and the sexual experimenting between Sam and Alyssa is integral in Sam's journey .Sam's opening masturbation scene is hilarious as well, BUT... It gets out of hand by the second half of the film. I really didn't need to see the sex scene between Somerhalder and Steenburgen. It didn't add a thing to the plot line and seemed like a cheap plot device. Also Sam prostituting himself for weed is not realistic. People might whore themselves out for coke or heroin, but not for a bag of weed. I loved the acting there, but Mark Andrus should've done his research.And I don't know how many times I've seen the troubled goth kid bit. Troubled does not equal black clothes,piercings, and eyeliner. It enforces a really bad stereotype.

George evolves little as a character throughout the entire film, but the people who interact with him change dramatically.  It's more about how you can change the lives of those around you and leave a lasting mark on the world than how to become self-actualized.Though Life as a House does offer up the cliche person dying of cancer and wanting to mend frayed relationships plot lines we've all seen a million times, there are a few nice surprises throughout and a delightful and heart warming ending.  I do feel like the story telling was a tad bit off and I didn't get to know the characters as well as I would have liked.  This, however, may have been purposeful to make the audience feel the same distance the characters felt from each other.  I'm not sure, I just feel like the story did not unfold as flawlessly as it could have, though I can't fully explain why.Life as a House is definitely one of the better dramas of recent years.  Though it does not equal the brilliance of American Beauty or Magnolia, it has merits of its own that are worth checking out.  If you can't stand Hayden Christensen, as I can't, this film will not change your mind.  If you just use a jedi mind trick on yourself and keep repeating Hayden Christensen is not completely awful and annoying, it can help take your mind off how awful and annoying he indeed is.

His ex-wife and kids live nearby but she is fairing only a little better thanks to massive problems with moody and suicidal teenage son Sam. Fired from his job George flips out before passing out on the street and waking up in hospital where he is diagnosed with terminal cancer and is given about four months to live. Determined to make these months count, George takes Sam in for the summer to help him finish building his house.Opening with an introduction to the kooky George and his troubled son Sam the film pretty much sticks to these basic characters and follows the narrative arch that you expect it to. In doing so it produces a solid enough drama without ever threatening to do anything far below the surface or that requires too much thought. The story is OK but I must admit to not being bolded over by the scenarios or the characters &#150; they all seemed too easy and never seemed to worry about developing them or even giving them a background that would explain their current situations. The detail of everything is swept to one side to the degree that even the fact that Sam is a rent boy of sorts seems to just happen without comment or negative feedback. To tackle such subjects would require a depth and a grittiness that the film doesn't aspire to have &#150; instead it wants simple relationships that can gradually mend, break and then mend again. In doing so it provides a fairly obvious sentimental drama that didn't do that much for me emotionally or impress me but had enough to hold my attention.The cast match this approach by being good in the general stuff but weak when it comes to the depth of their characters. Kline plays the amiable, kooky father quite well and is able to work with the arch of bonding etc but he doesn't convince as a real person and didn't have me bought into his gradual slide towards death (which seems to come and go dependant on the narrative). Likewise Christensen is OK with the basic bits but when asked to reach deeper he cannot manage it so, despite the suicide, drugs and male prostitution, he just comes off like a stroppy teen. Thomas is more convincing perhaps because her character is quite real. Malone is fun but doesn't make a lot of sense while Steenburgen is pretty wasted in her role.Overall this is a fairly obvious sentimental drama that, for all its gloss and professional presentation, doesn't really get beyond the surface of the story, action or characters. As a result it is enjoyable but not really that memorable and I was disappointed that it seemed contented to skim the surface rather than really provide something challenging to get my teeth into.

But I won't. This is the type of movie where you laugh at the wrong moment, and I did have quite a bit of fun seeing the predictable story run off into quite unpredictable (and implausible) side-alleys. Especially the scene where George tries to hug the electrician is worth the ticket.Technically the movie is sound but tasteless. Some strange camera angles are a bit confusing. The sound is typical of other bland Hollywood industry turnout music that is not there to emphasize but rather to lull you into a comfortable popcorn-and-beer numbness; sound effects that make up for the lack of dialogue and script exactness (like car doors that have a fat thump reminding you of car commercials).This is social drama with no drama and no social criticism; the problems are expedited, not analyzed. Mum is rich and lonely but suddenly decides to make lunch on her own (a maid briefly appears, but she seems to be there for decorative purposes) and to bring it to her bummy ex-husband. What you remember is the big Mercedes she uses for the task. This Mercedes is prominently on display, vindicating the flimsy attempts at a criticism of contemporary society.Never do you understand the motives of the different characters. The motives aren't clarified and if they were, it would become only too apparent that their actions are totally unrealistic. Especially the metamorphosis of Sam from a drug-abusing prostitute to a loving son with perfect girlfriend in a matter of weeks is just too much.This is a totally superfluous movie. It has some good intentions but it does more bad than good because its director and/or producer just couldn't be bothered to take the story and the spectators seriously.

I saw it at the Boston Film Festival where Kevin Kline and the director were supposed to be present, but mercifully could not attend.  I was very excited about this film, and do not know when I have been so disappointed.  It was so syrupy and sentimental, so blindingly unsubtle that I felt like I was counting down the minutes, waiting for the main character to die.To return to my assertion that everyone involved gave this film their best effort, let me begin by commenting on the performances.  Kevin Kline and Hayden Christensen attempted honest, heart-wrenching performances, and I commend them for this.  Unfortunately, the dialogue was such debilitating tripe, that they could only do so much with it.  Everything that every character said seemed like the subtext that should motivate a line, not be the line itself.  How can anyone take lines like, I've been using since I was twelve!  or I wanted to make you love me.  Well it worked! seriously?  An audience member can only be expected to swallow so much overblown sentimentality... is natural-sounding, subtle dialogue so much to ask?A similar level of laying it on thick can be found in the cinematography. A few shots of the sun setting behind the ocean with symphonic music swelling is nice, one every five minutes is painful.And finally, I have some issues with even something as basic as the plot. It felt as though there was two disparate stories shoved into the same ninety minutes.  One was the story of Kevin Kline learning that he is dying and making a last ditch effort to bond with his wayward son.  Fine, this was the movie I payed ten dollars to see.  But there was also a story about sexual deviance and lust that felt woefully out of place.  Typically, I would be more drawn to the sexual deviance plot than the father/son reunion plot, but not both at the same time.  Sex is rampant between the characters, nudity misplaced, and the whole sexual theme only feels awkward and tacked on.Basically, I thought this movie was monstrous; certainly, it was one of the worst films I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, it is only so bad because it had the potential to be so good.  With fine actors and a fine cinematographer on hand, I guess I choose to blame the writers for this abomination.  In this movie, we learn that all it takes for a rebel to become a good, clean cut kid is to stop dying your hair and to take out your piercings.  I don't think there is so easy a solution for saving this wayward film.

George demands his son Sam stay with him in his shack, and Sam soon finds out George intends on building a house.

His ex-wife Robin soon starts bringing George and Sam lunch (conveniently, the whole world exists within a car ride, if not closer, and that includes the inevitable hospital).  She does not have a good relationship with Sam either.  Eventually Robin falls in love with George all over again, for some reason, and eventually Sam warms up to the idea of helping with the house. Its all pretty predictable.  The screenplay contains genuine moments of human interaction and a little unnecessary drama.  It also contains some dialogue that crashes to the floor the second its spoken.  Some of the sub-plots are not needed.  The movie could use a joke or two to lighten the mood after awhile.  On the other hand, there is a lot of examination of the relationship between parents and children which is very well done.  Not all parents who love their children also LIKE their children - this is openly discussed, and I can't think of another movie that explored that.  It also shows how similar father and son are, even if they aren't close - Sam is like George in many ways, and part of that seems to be heredity.  This was also very interesting to me; my parents divorced when I was ten and quite often I've been told I am like my father, even though we didn't even have that much contact before he left.

There's one problem though American Beauty is one of the best films of all time. Life as a House is one of the worst films of all time. Life is a watered down, less extreme version of American Beauty. It's for the teenagers whose parents won't let them watch American Beauty. And why not? It has an up-and-coming teen heartthrob who can't act worth two tomatoes (Hayden Christensen), an older star that can draw older audiences (Kevin Kline), a bunch of random B-list actors, and someone who deserves better than this type of movie (Jena Malone).George (Kline) is just fired from his job as an architect (where he supposedly designed hundreds of great buildings-then why does he live in a normal house in suburbia?) who is diagnosed with some sort of cancer. He decides to build a house with his estranged Goth son Sam (Christensen) during his last few months. Within a few days, their relationship turns around and they both work on the house. That's it. That's a pretty exciting two hours, isn't it?The thing in this movie that annoyed me the most was the constant barrage of morals. They had no real place in the movie, and they just kept being thrown at us. Director Irwin Winkler goes with the crap against the wall theory-throw enough crap against the wall and some will stick. That's not the case here. Nothing sticks. What's even worse is that they don't even follow with the morals they introduce. For example, George tells Sam how change is gradual and you might not even realize it. In the next scene, Sam's a completely different (normal) person. That's not that gradual, if I'm not mistaken. A mistake that was made was billing this as a dramedy. It could be considered a drama, but it's not funny unless you laugh at a naked boy being nervous around a naked girl or people talking about the stench of their fecal material. I thought this was supposed to be an adult drama. Nope, I'm getting this confused with American Beauty again.So if this man's final dream is to build a house with his son, why, as the movie's going towards its denouement, EVERYONE FROM THE FREAKING NEIGHBORHOOD IS BUILDING THE HOUSE FOR HIM! This architectural genius, whose final dream is to build a house by himself (and his son), is being done for him. And he's not even upset! He might not have been able to finish it, but that's not the point. The point is that it's shoddy writing by Mark Andrus. More foul balls on the writer's court Sam's change is uncalled for. George tells him a sob story about how his dad used to beat him, and then Sam has some sort of mental epiphany and wants to help his dad. Every single character is underdeveloped. Who is this George guy? Why should we care if/when he dies or not? Have we seen anything previously that should make us like him? And instead of making us feel sorry for Sam, I became angry at my namesake. I understand what it's like to be a teenager (I am one), and moodswings are common, but man, what a jerk! I don't have any random drug addictions like Sam in the movie did, but he's just a completely unlikable character.Kline can never top his work in A Fish Called Wanda, and he knows it. He doesn't even try here. I'm ready for my paycheck, Mr. DeMille. Christensen, as many may recognize from the ill-conceived Star Wars prequels as Anakin, is the opposite of Kline and trying too hard. Everyone else tries too hard. The only one who succeeds is Malone, in her small role. Her movies haven't been the greatest (see also Saved!), but she's a good actress and can turn a role in any crappy movie into something pretty good. But just because she's good doesn't mean the rest of the movie doesn't stink to high hell. It really does. How much do I hate this movie? After I finished watching it, I tried to ruin the DVD for others before returning it to Netflix. I want no one else to watch this movie.My rating 2/10Rated R for language, sexuality and drug use.

I had seen Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode II and thought that he was cute. I wanted to see some of his other movies, but nothing prepared me for what I was about to see. I thought I was just going to watch a hot guy just looking good in front of a camera. I was not expecting to see such a talented actor. Hayden was amazing. Because of him, I'm thinking of becoming an actress. Not only to be in a movie with him (pathetic, I know, but a girl can still dream!) but also because I want to be a part of a movie like Life as a House. I can't imagine the great pride he must feel for making that movie. I want to feel that same pride. Hopefully more people will watch this great movie and be inspired to reach for their dreams and live life to the fullest, never turning down any opportunities that may arise or take advantage of the wonder that is life.

Kline rises above the made-for-tv/disease-of-the-week trappings of this otherwise been-there/done-that inspiration through death theme as a self-absorbed architect whose diagnosis of cancer leads him to use the titular metaphor to re-establish his relationship with his rebellious and angry son (Christensen, who ably gives a fine performance of conflicting nature) before it's too late.  Fine ensemble yet heavy-handed direction by Irwin Winkler leadens down the somewhat pat and predictable screenplay by Mark Andros.

A man is dying and spends his last summer with his son to build his dream house. He dies and lives on as a house?!?! What the f*** is that for a story.The movie is slow of pass and nothing really happens. Just a couple of people how built a house. The makers tried by adding a few loss jokes to make the movie funny.People how like a juicy movie will like it, but every normal human being gets bored after 20 minutes. I think it's a wonder that i made it to the end of this after falling to sleep for 8 times. So don't be fooled by the IMDB rating...

The film makers aimed high, but with awful dialogue, laughable acting, and diretion by the man who brought us THE NET, it hit very low. One of the biggest problems with the movie is the screenplay, filled with horrible lines like You're a great architect and a terrible human being. The fact that the performaces suck doesn't help the picture either. Kevin Kline is a good actor, but in the role of a man dying of cancer he cannot match up to Takashi Shimura's touching performance. Hayden Christensen is just a bad actor; he sucked in STAR WARS and he sucks here. IKIRU is one of the ten best films ever made, so it's clear why they wanted to steal from it, but the things they added are unforgivable. Any movie narrated by a house should be burned. Anyone who likes this movie either hasn't seen IKIRU or is a fool. This is no more than the result of yet another brilliant film plundered for money and ill-gotten oscars (thank god this film went ignored by award ceremonies). Don't be fooled! See the original!

When it did try to do something other than force tears out of the audience, its attempts at humor fell flat, unless you like teenage sex jokes, jabs at homosexuality, and people falling off roofs and seriously injuring themselves.Kristen Scott Thomas and Kevin Kline humiliate themselves with their overwrought performances.  Mary Steenburgen fares even worse in her bit part.  And the girl who played her nymphette daughter was just loony.The script was terrible.  It was full of cliches and neat coincidences that set up easy and unrealistic solutions to the various subplots.Don't see this movie.  You'll regret it.

I also have been 'Arts & Entertainment' editor for my high school and college newspapers. I never write on this website, but I had to after watching 'Life as a House.' It was a horrible horrible movie that was a waste of 2 hours. There are no redeeming qualities to this film. It has a horrid plot, pathetic acting (even though Kevin Kline is normally good), bad dialogue, and tasteless content. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLY RIDICULOUS AND BAD. That's all I wanted to say.  "}]
