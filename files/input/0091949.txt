This film is wonderfully life-affirming through the character of robot Jonny 5 (the scene where he realises what it means to be alive through crushing a grass hopper is beautifully portrayed), Ally Sheedy brings a bucket load of positive energy to the character of the naive but loving Stephanie, and to top it all there is a subtle but powerful comment on American militarism. There is a real emphasis on quality screen writing here which only comes through on a small ratio of films. The characters could easily have become 2 dimensional stereotypes, but instead given some interesting dialogue and motives (science, military etc). Yes it is cheesy, and I think many people label it as a cheap and tacky 80's movie, but having watched it again recently I think history may well judge it a minor classic.

Indeed, this seems to be the most profitable kind of film to make, with the family-oriented often translating to the lowest common denominator. There is a rare kind of film in this oversaturated market, however. Namely, the film that claims it can entertain an audience in almost any age bracket, and really can deliver on this promise. I know how this sounds, so bear with me a moment.Short Circuit is, at heart, a comedy about what happens when a robot designed to replace a special forces soldier is struck by lightning, and starts to believe he is a living entity. Much of the rest of the film revolves around either Number 5's attempts to evade capture by the people who made him, or his attempts to convince the people he meets of the truly wonderful thing that has happened to him. Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg provide an excellent support cast that does a first rate job of interacting with the character. This was one of the first films to show human actors engaging in conversation with what was essentially a full-scale puppet, and it remains one of the best. With brilliant voice acting by Tim Blaney, Number 5 seems more human than some of the other actors in the film, especially G.W. Bailey. They must have had a special on Police Academy alumni that year.Speaking of Police Academy, the let's rip the front seats out and sit in the back joke gets a couple of references here. In fact, a few old classics get a good reference in this effort. Interestingly enough, the Three Stooges short that is shown and imitated in a couple of sequences is called Woman Haters. Go figure. The one weakness of the film is that it seems primarily constructed around a few puppeteering or special effects sequences. The use of the laser beams here seems very dated by modern standards, and the computers would look unbelievable if I hadn't personally seen the computers that were available to the public and business around this year.Sadly, they do not make films like this anymore. In this day and age, where every film has to be made as expensively as possible, and even films aimed at children seem segmented, nobody seems willing to consider that the adults in the audience might need to be entertained, too. Which is a real pity. Films like Short Circuit have the ability to appeal to this viewer even more now that he is twenty-something years old than was the case when he was eight years old. I doubt that anyone who turns twenty-six in 2020 is going to same the same about the Pokemon or other such mind-numbing single-digit-age-only crap that is being churned out.I gave Short Circuit an eight out of ten. It is starting to show its age, but as a relic of the mid-1980s, it also shows that there were people asking questions about the advancement of technology. Indeed, on the basis of films like Short Circuit, I am almost willing to regard the 1980s as the last bastion of creativity in the mainstream film industry. Give it a look expecting a film about more than money, and you may be pleasantly surprised.

They sort of resemble Conky from the old Pee Wee's Play House series. One of the robots, 'Number Five', escapes and finds sanctuary in the home of Stephanie Speck (Allly Sheedy), a nice lady with a soft spot for runaways. Speck becomes good friends with 'Number Five' who begins to take on a lot of human characteristics, transcending the static life of a robot or the hostile life of a military weapon, which is what the robots were designed for. Speck learns that Number Five's owners are looking for him, but she knows that the military would only destroy Number Five or terminate the emotional drive that he has developed. Number Five's designer, Newton Crosby (Guttenberg) and his silly assistant Ben Jabituya (Stevens), have yet to appreciate what Number Five has achieved, as a shell of wires and controls able to take on human qualities, but, soon, they too will join Speck in the quest to save 'Number Five.' Some of it is kind of reminscint of other 80s sci-fi movies like 'Batteries Not Included' and 'E.T.' There's two issues at work in this movie. The first, and obvious one being about the development of human emotion and would it be possible for anything to gain an understanding and appreciation for it? And the second being the ethics of military useage. Plus, it's your standard 80s love and friendship story. Because of the story and the sharp wit comedy and sarcasm, it's makes for good comedy. I haven't seen the sequel in a long time, but I do remember enjoying it almost as much as the first. I think that's because 'Number Five' is such a funny, loveable robot.If you like the theme of this movie, I recommend seeing the hilarious comedy, 'Making Mr. Right,' which is about a robot designed for space exploration rather than military use. But, the robot begins to take on human emotions while the owner becomes increasingly more like a robot. (It's from Susan Siedleman, the director of 'Desperately Seeking Susan.')

I'm not going to spoil the movie as to what makes the ending great, but I liked the way the movie ended.I also think that the type of people who would enjoy this movie are the people who feel like Newton Crosby. He's devoted his entire life to something (science and technology), just to have others who used to be devoted to it steal it all away from him. It's almost like the whole movie you want to score one for the little guy. Most of us have been there at some point in our lives. This movie kind of captures that, and if you watch the movie with that intent, it does keep the viewer intrigued.The movie also makes you appreciate what your life is, when you see just what the robot can do, and you realize just what your mind is capable of.All in all, I think I found it a lot more touching than it should have been, because it was 315am when I started watching it, and I THINK I watched the movie Pi right before it.

Maturer audiences will have a hard time overlooking some of the childish nuances of the movie, but it is such a fun and entertaining family film that all of those things can be easily forgiven. It reminds me of other wonderful family films like Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies, that I used to watch over and over when I was a kid. I feel like I've lost something when I can't think of a single movie now that I love so much that I will watch it a few times a week. Maybe I just am more aware of the time involved in watching the same movie over and over today than I used to be. Johnny 5 is a robot designed for military use until one day it's struck by lightning and, apparently, comes to life. This is a pretty tired formula, something man-made suddenly displaying life-like qualities and wanting to be recognized as a real boy, but it's accompanied by some clever messages about the advancement of technology, particularly technology designed to replace humans, which has always been seen as a bit of a dangerous idea, criticized brilliantly by everyone from Charlie Chaplin to James Cameron. Johnny 5's adventures involve his efforts to avoid capture by the people who made him (NOVA! No!!), while at the same time trying to prove to the world that he's a living entity now. They could not make a movie like this today. Sadly, CGI has forever replaced the need to create a physical robot like the one that plays Johnny 5 in this movie, so any Short Circuit that was made today would just be some soul-less digital effect cavorting across the screen, instantly forgettable. But here, he's really there, and he's heavy and clumsy and metallic, but so memorable as a movie character that I've recently read that the actual robot prop was sold for something like $500,000. Now THAT is a fan!Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy have a cute chemistry on screen that is satisfactorily simple. They are both cookie-cutter caricatures, Sheedy the lonely Stephanie, who drives an ice-cream truck for a living, and Guttenberg plays a scientist named Newton, who works for the evil NOVA but who only needs a cute ice-cream lady and a charming robot to change his evil ways. Sound like fun? No? Well, it is, trust me. The film has definitely dated, but I'll take special effects that look dated 20 years later over expensive CGI that never looked real in the first place any day. A lot of films claim to be fun for all ages, but Short Circuit is one of the few that really is. It's too bad that movies like this seem to be gone forever now&#133;.

After they show how the can eliminate a variety of vehicles everybody goes inside and the robots are recharged... while robot number five is still connected to the generator there is a lightning strike which causes it to malfunction. After a collision with a rubbish disposal robot it ends up on the back of a lorry with the rubbish and is taken off the base. At around the same time it is noticed that he is missing and everybody at Nova, the company that made it, starts to panic. Skroeder, the head of security sets off with his men to catch it while its inventor Dr. Newton Crosby and his assistant Ben Jabituya follow its tracking signal to help them locate it. They find Number Five but it evades capture by jumping off a bridge and parachuting on to the back of a van driven by Stephanie, by now it is out of range for the tracker.When Stephanie finds Number Five she initially thinks he is an alien and invites it into her house where he seeks input, he quickly reads every book in the house and turns to the television for further learning. When she learns that instead of being an alien he is a robot from a weapons manufacturer she is not impressed and calls them to take it away, however when she tells Number Five that he is to return to Nova he reacts in a way one wouldn't expect from an inanimate object... he shows fear. Realising that he is in danger Number Five takes Stephanie's van which he learns how to drive by reading the instruction manual. She manages to jump aboard as he drives off but they crash and are found be Doctor Crosby who deactivates Number Five and puts him on a truck bound for Nova. Five however manages to reactivate himself and escapes once again. He returns to Stephanie and is present to help rescue her from her abusive ex-boyfriend. She believes that if she can persuade Doctor Crosby that Number Five is alive then he well help them, unfortunately they meeting is interrupted by Skroeder and as well as rescuing Stephanie Number Five must confront the other robots, I won't say what he does to them as it would spoil one of the films jokes.As stated before the film still seems charming and Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg performed well in the lead roles and while watching it was easy to suspend disbelief and accept that Number Five was indeed alive. I'm not sure what to make of Fisher Stevens's portrayal of Ben Jabituya, on the one hand he was an amusing character, on the other it seemed very dated to have a white actor playing an Indian rather than actually employing somebody from the Sub-continent. There are one or two jokes some parents might find a bit racy but I think most children would enjoy this film as will plenty of adults, especially those who first saw it as youngsters in the '80.

Though if you look beyond the computer components and the boring banter of this high tech machine facility, what we have is a quite an adventurous, and surprise fun flick. When a experimental robot, among a score of them, is electrocuted and grows smarts and takes off from the facility to tour the splendour of San Francisco, it's creator, likable Guttenberg, a stay in, and his peers, one another Police Academy favourite, are desperate to recover it, where they do whatever it takes. The robot is befriended by a female vet, sweet Sheedy who harbours it, and the two become great friends. The manipulation of the robot is very smart as from the designers of it, and the escape sequences are so well done. Too, I liked the geeky, sleepy voice of one of the managers, as if illustrating sarcastically the enjoyment of this job. Fisher Stevens is a hoot as Guttenberg's assistant, who lectures him on how there's another world outside the facility. SC pretty much has the same kind of approaching climax, whether it's ET, Starman, where Sheedy, who of course strikes up a relationship with Guttenberg, will protect Johnny Five at all costs, from the facility guy who will turn back into an experiment. Not being a lover of kid's flicks, though I was more flexible as a teen, this film had grown on me, and it's song from El Debarge rocks. Certainly a movie for all ages, this couldn't be a more perfect flick for everyone.

After escaping the high-tech facility where he was designed and built (by Steve Guttenberg, of all people!!!), Number 5 meets animal-lover Stephanie (Ally Sheedy), absorbs huge amounts of information from her books and television, and learns that life is precious&#151;especially his own.Oozing 80s style from every frame, Short Circuit might be an extremely dated movie (check out the computers that feature in the film&#151;a Mac classic is seen being unpacked!) but it still manages to be a whole load of fun thanks to its likable characters and a pretty funny script. I just finished watching the DVD with my kids (aged 7 and 5), and we all had a great time I particularly enjoyed the sense of nostalgia I got from watching a 'pre-internet, pre-mobile phone era' piece of cheesy sci-fi from my youth, whilst the children just lapped up the silly antics of Johnny 5.Badham might not be the most stylish of directors, but he can always be relied upon to deliver a solidly entertaining film, and although this one isn't packed with state of the art special effects (even for the time), sometimes the action is rather weak (the 'high speed' chase scenes look rather slow to me), and Fisher Stevens' portrayal of an Asian is rather dubious, it's still worth a try.

Whereas I've watched it several times, I haven't seen it in its entirety for at least 15 years, give or take some. Watching it again tonight, and I was blown away. Whereas it is true that both Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy play tired roles (the liberal cat lady and the insanely dorky scientist), as an insanely dorky scientist myself (or at least a grad student) the funniest moments are Fisher Stevens' comments about adult-related humor that I just now get. As Guttenberg is discussing the meeting in the bar with Stevens, I'm rolling on the floor laughing, because I know guys who talk like that...The film does have tons of what I'd like to call fuzzy logic to it, as well. The CEO of the company obviously would have had control over his security, even as pencil-necked as he was. They would not simply go out and try to destroy a 11 million dollar investment willy-nilly, or come out with a military option again and again if it kept failing (which it did, several times). The scientist in me screams against the stupidity of the security force destroying the experiment, whatever it may have been.However, the movie stands on its own two feet. Sure, it's a relative hack job at parts. But, it's fun, it gets into some issues in a backwards sense. It takes a large leap at the moment where No. 5 becomes able to think abstractly, considering the problems that abstraction has been having in computer programs, but that's going to be given considering that they're screenwriters.An iconic child's film, worth seeing again for those in their twenties now.

This is the kind of well-plotted, action-packed family fare that gets by on physical effects and well-filmed action sequences, rather than boring and tired CGI scenes. The choice of making Johnny 5 a physical model was a very good one as you never question the believability for a second. Plus he's one of the most lovable robots ever put on screen, so there's that.Otherwise, the story is fairly typical for an '80s film. There's the 'outsider' heroine, played by Ally Sheedy, who goes on the run from the usual military-type bad guys who take ruthlessness to the extreme. G. W. Bailey plays EXACTLY the same role as his one in POLICE ACADEMY, and Steven Guttenberg is very similar to his part in that film too. Fisher Stevens gives the most memorable and funniest performance as the Indian guy; those who champion political correctness might question the use of 'brown face' but it's hard to dislike his constant malapropisms and his sheer good-naturedness.Otherwise, SHORT CIRCUIT proves to be a rollicking good time for all the family. There are fun references to classic movies, lots of cute animals, chase scenes, explosions, and a wonderful, western-style showdown. No crude or lowbrow humour in sight, but some nice throwaway jokes for adult viewers. Plus there's that ending, which will have any kid crying. The one reason this works though is that Johnny 5 is an extremely endearing protagonist, and would return in the even better sequel, SHORT CIRCUIT 2.

More than 20 years have passed since I had last seen it, so it was with cautious optimism that I selected it on Netflix. I have fond memories of it, but I was just a kid then. Now, I can see it falls into just about every pitfall of the comedies that characterized the '80s. It closely follows the sappy E.T. formula, where an innocent, otherworldly creature is hunted by the heartless military authorities. So this is definitely a kid's film&#x85; or is it? It stars the contemptible Steve Gutternberg (who hasn't starred in anything worthwhile since), as a carefree roboticist, and Ally Sheedy of The Breakfast Club gets caught in the middle as the animal-loving girl who can't find a trustworthy man. Notably, Fisher Stevens rounds out the cast as a racist brown face East Indian character with a thick accent. He's full of off-putting sexual innuendos, which kind of tars the film's family-friendly image. But there's enough slapstick gags based on The Three Stooges that Short Circuit is clearly appealing to a younger audience.The undeniable star of the show is Number 5, a prototype built by the NOVA company for the military. It was designed by the legendary concept artist Syd Mead (who gave us the TRON lightcycles and Blade Runner's spinners, among others). It's a fantastic looking robot puppet, and was one of the most sophisticated movie props ever built. It's expressive eyes are enough to melt any robot junkie's heart, even if it's primary objective is to nuke the Soviets. Hit by a jolt of lightning after an explosive demonstration of the robot squad's firepower, Number 5 inexplicably becomes self-aware and shows incredible intelligence and curiosity. It's a far cry from the complex and semi-believable explanations made by smarter science fiction, but it's just one of those things you have to go along with for the sake of the plot.Of course, all hell breaks loose when Number 5 inadvertently escapes from NOVA's lab. It's absolute nonsense with few if any laughs, but it's still sort of fun to watch out of curiosity. One can't help but notice the similarity between Number 5 and certain real robots developed since then. I'm sure I'll probably make a lot of people angry by saying so, but Short Circuit hasn't exactly aged well. It's one of the few examples of robots on film where the robot isn't a villain, so at least it has that going for it. It's practically required viewing if you're into robots, but unless you're on a serious nostalgia kick you're probably better off skipping it and watching WALL-E again instead.

Number 5, a prototype military robot, is hit by a power surge that causes a malfunction in its programming. When an accident sees it leave the Nova Laboratories grounds, Number 5 finds his way to the home of Stephanie Speck (Sheedy). Here it displays signs of being alive, but the new found respect for life could soon be curtailed as the Nova security staff are seeking him out for disassembly. On release it was met with mostly positive reviews, debuting at No.1 at the box office, film was undoubtedly a family winner. Also spawning a sequel due to its popularity, Short Circuit is by definition an enjoyable fantasy flick. Yet today there are film critics who give it a good kicking, lamenting how safe it is and decrying the sentimental aspects that come to the fore in the latter stages. That to me is like shooting Bambi! A refusal to let the child in all of us come out once in a while. Yeah it's schmaltzy at times, I'd personally be disappointed if a film about a robot finding a will to live wasn't! While in Sheedy and Guttenberg you couldn't ask for two more amiable bastions of Americana to star in such a movie. But the feel good factor is high and it's also full of funny sequences. Saturday Night Fever and The Three Stooges play a part, as does Fisher Stevens, who send the PC brigade scurrying for their complaint pens.

The result, a robot made for military use on the run from the military who wants to get it back. He somehow gets into the home of a woman who takes him in and soon discovers that the robot is actually quite intelligent and she later tries to convince one of his creators that he is actually alive. A lot of funny things happen, though as you can expect a lot of sweet sentimental stuff is to be expected too.

One of the robots, Number Five, is hit by lightning and as a result is able to become alive. He escapes from Nova and befriends a woman named Stephanie and begins to gain a lot of input and learns a lot. Nova plans on capturing him, but Number Five realizes that he must not get captured in order to remain alive.First off I have to say that this film is a comedy and much of it should not be taken seriously. By that I mean that the depiction of the military group of Nova constantly bickering and having lame discussions is something that film intended on doing.The acting and human characters are pretty odd in this film. I can see why Steve Guttenberg is constantly criticized by viewers. He is just a boring not funny guy who makes robots in this film. Ally Sheed plays Stephanie, a really naive and not that intelligent veterinarian. Also the character of Ben being a Caucasian who speaks like an Indian Person is something that I think is pretty funny, if not a bit racist as well. But for the most part the human characters are not special at all and completely overshadowed.They attempt to make a love story with Guttenberg and Sheed's character. However it comes off as rushed and horrible and I did not buy it. If anything the romance with Number five and Stephanie is much more convincable.The reason for this film being good is Number Five. Number Five is one of the greatest robot characters ever in a film. Hilarious, intelligent, and highly entertaining. He can do anything. It is quite interesting seeing him gain input and learn a lot about the world. It is not common for a robot to steal the show and make a movie good just by itself, but this is one case where that happens and the film is good because of it.Quite an interesting film. Lame acting and human characters. However a great character in Number Five. I recommend this film to viewers because of Number Five.

It delights in its tackiness, awkward jokes and poking fun at both the tech movement and Cold War dramas. It never gives off the sense that it's trying to be something it's not, staying fresh, funny and even laughing at itself.Maybe the best way to put the filmmaker's attitudes into perspective while making Short Circuit would be to mention that director John Badham not only made a much more serious Cold War adventure film in War Games a few years before, but the robot (No. 5 as he's called) at one point imitates John Travolta's dance moves in Saturday Night Fever, another Badham film. Badham even takes to making fun of his other work using Short Circuit.Although Badham gets the credit for making No. 5 such a lovable character (with some help from fine voice acting in Tim Blaney), the writing team of Wilson and Maddock deserve a lot of credit for the film's clever and amusing take on artificial life as well as the numerous jabs at Cold War America.Short Circuit is about a top secret set of military robots designed by Newton (Steve Guttenberg of Police Academy) for the military supplier he works for called NOVA. When a lightning strike fries one of the robots, he ignores his programming and escapes the facility where he meets an animal-lover named Stephanie (Ally Sheedy of Badham's War Games) who takes him in believing he's an alien. When NOVA searches for No. 5, the robot soon develops the concept that if NOVA catches him, they will disassemble or kill him. The rest of the film No. 5 is on the run with the help of Stephanie and eventually Newton.No. 5 is a crafty robot thanks to some brilliant writing. After soaking in hours of television, he drops clever catch phrases from westerns and other films including commercial jingles as he evades his captors and even other robots in what is a hysterical sequence. Wilson, Maddock and Badham realize what a truly unique character they have to play with and they utilize him to the fullest.Admirably, everyone on this movie knows that the plot is immaterial and it's all about watching to see what goofy stuff No. 5 will do next. Both Sheedy and Guttenberg just play to the robot, seeming to laugh whenever they have to interact with him. They understand it's not about them at all and they just enjoy themselves while doing adequate acting. The only other role with any personality is Fisher Stevens as Ben, the unacknowledged Indian stereotype that loves women and butchering English phrases for comedic value. Funny, but it probably wouldn't fly in the 21st Century.It's also worth knowing that this is not as much a family film. Kids will find No. 5 funny, but there's a lot of questionable language including some sexual references. With the number of funny one-liners, Short Circuit is ripe for kids to repeat. Still, the comedy in this film is so much better than so many other '80s movies because it recognizes that it's goofy, which also makes the satire work better. Not Badham or anyone else tried too hard to make a quality movie and the result was that they got one.

It's full of foul language, even from the robot and it got a real dark sense of humor that is more likely to scare kids that entertain them. Number 5 is a cute character when he is not shooting at something with his laser and when his eyes are blood shot red.It's about a series of prototype robots called S.A.I.N.T.S. (Strategic Artificially Intelligent Nuclear Transport) that are built by NOVA Laboratories. Newton Graham (Steve Guttenberg) is the designer of the robots and he disagrees with the companies agenda of using the robots for the Cold War. Number 5 is hit by a lightning storm and has his programming scrambled which gives him a sense of free will and he becomes intelligent. The Robot escapes the facility and ends up on the run with, Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy ) while a team of agents are in hot pursuit to recover the robot as his laser is still armed.Number 5 is a battlefield weapon. He moves and talks like a real person and has a strong intelligence he gathers from reading through books at lightening speed. His metallic body and impressive facial structure make him an interesting character to look at. The picture opens with a demonstration of the robots using lasers to blow up several army jeeps. Steve Guttenberg appears as a slack-type brilliant scientist who doesn't like media or press because of the companies intentions with the robots he has made for them. Guttenberg becomes the lucky hero when he must get the robot back before the company he works for loses all their funding.It's got an impressive story but this is a very dark and violent film. Whenever the robot is going to blast something, his eyes turn red and he looks like something nightmares are made of. He has a friendly heart but the army chases him throughout the whole picture and its a gunshot here and a gunshot there. It never rises above a basic premise to give us anything special. It reminded me of ET in the sense that Number 5 is almost like an alien. He is curious and has no assurance of his surroundings. He doesn't know what's going to happen next but he can sense the danger ahead.None of the characters in the picture is interesting except for Ally Sheedy. She is a third major character. She takes care of animals in her home so we can figure out what her personality is but she never does anything in the picture except try to hide the robot until Steve Guttenberg shows up and finally realizes the robot is alive at the last twenty minutes of the movie. When Number 5 shows up on her doorstep, she adopts him thinking he is an alien when she finds him in her ice cream truck. There are a lot of good ideas here but none of them are presented and we're left with a boring premise that showcases Number 5's robotic abilities and the plot never rise above a Search & Destroy movie that is too dark and violent for kids.

She was clearly the movie's means of showing off Number 5 and his new self awareness no matter how elementary it was done.Still, I appreciate the movie Short Circuit.

Number Five begins at first as a clean slate from the electric mishap, having no memory of being programmed at all, and has a thirst for input....any kind of data it can absorb. Books, television, radio songs, it all helps recreate him along with human emotion just like a regular person. Being on the loose, N.O.V.A's director has given strict orders to do whatever it takes to take the robot down, since they are not sure if he will harm anyone outside in the civilian life, after they find out he is still armed with his laser. It's all a fun journey to stay 'alive', along with the help of his female friend Stephanie (Ally Sheedy) he befriends along the way.

Of course, most of them are either made so badly that they gain a cult following or they just sink altogether with no one behind them at all. And then there are the few that stand the test of time for being executed well and received few to little recognition. Just like the film Leviathan (1989), which was a combination of several previous films, still had a lot of appeal to it. The same goes for Short Circuit.It obviously does not have the same story line but the looks and the feel of it are almost parallel to the movie of E.T. The Extra- Terrestrial (1982). Short Circuit is literally about a Short Circuit in the robotic war machine. The Short Circuit occurs when a bolt of lightning strikes the robot and gives it its own brain. Like any character's origin, they are always new to their surroundings. The robot analyzes and senses its perimeter to make an assessment of what it should do next. And as time goes on, the character begins to learn how to react quicker in different situations.However, none of this were to have happened if it wasn't for the help of Ally Sheedy's character, Stephanie Speck. The voice of the machine is by Tim Blaney. Steven Guttenberg plays the creator of the machine (Newton Crosby) in this story. Guttenberg makes a good nerd, especially for what he looks like and his inability to communicate like a normal human being. Along side Crosby is his close friend Ben, played by Fisher Stevens, who I'll admit besides the robot, had some funny lines. I thought the robot character was well done too. The personality is very childlike and innocent which makes it a cute character to watch and listen too. It's not to say it has the greatest story or the funniest lines, but it does have character. In a sense it appears to look like a premature WALL·E (2008). The puppetry is well done too. All the movements are smooth and coordinated, making it look very lifelike. The soundtrack by David Shire is good too. The re-occurring them is welcomed as is the emotional tones there inserted inside them. If only this film could be looked back on as not a cheese film but of something with more value than that, then it really would stand the test of time.Short Circuit is well made for its time with realistic puppetry, comical scenes and good music. Yet it still can't detach itself from the era that it came from.

Short Circuit is part of my youth, I've seen it when I was 13 years old and I simply loved it. It brings some cute ideas from ET, in the shape of a very funny robot that is brought to life (and given human thoughts) after being struck by a lightning. The whole story is very cute, I cannot judge the flaws or the glitches here and there because the target is mainly young people who couldn't care less about those things - and mostly, the ones that you may get to see aren't important. I'm also not judging the actors that much, they do their job just right, in a story that goes around Number 5 or Johnny 5. So after all, I decided to give it a '9' because I feel that this movie has been a bit underrated, probably because most people who are rating it didn't see it in the right time, and yes, 26 years later it's not the same thing...

It is fun to see how the writer takes the blank slate of the robot's mind and has it learn and connect concepts. Johnny Five is as hilarious as any alien ever was. His fresh wise cracks and sense of humor are great, but are secondary to the excellent humor offered by the character Ben. This foreign (?) U.S. native, with his (unintentional?) misuse of the English language with a straight face, is my favorite comedic character in the movie. The story is corny, it's true, but the humor is dry - and that's what I love about it.

He leaves the lab and goes out, the adventures have begun. Number Five becomes very hungry for input and thinks he is alive.

Then Number Five meets a young woman, Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy), and they become friends. After learning about the beauty of life (Remember that butterfly on the truck?) and what death is (After Five unintentionally killed an insect while trying to jump like it), Number Five refuses to be disassembled (which is death).

But he and Stephanie have to convince Newton Crosby (the robot's co-creator, played by Steve Guttenberg) that Five is ALIVE and has emotions, just like humans. As the ending approaches the plot gets really dramatic and you feel so happy after you watch the whole movie.Number Five is enormously sweet and adorable on one particularly memorable scene which he dances with Stephanie and sings along to More than a Woman.

A Short Circuit made in 2007 would be mind-numbingly PC with bullet-time effects and a CGI Johnny voiced by a hip-hop 'artist'. It's a grim time for this genre indeed. But back in 1986 I had nothing to complain about as most of the family movies from that decade are fondly remembered as classics.I loved this movie as a kid and it's been a long, long time since I watched it from start to finish. Plus the VHS I rented back then was in horrid pan and scan with half the picture chopped-off. Which is a real shame since John Badham shot it brilliantly-framed Panavision. So I've never really seen the FULL movie until now. How does it hold-up 21 years later? Well, I guess you could say Johnny Five is kinda dated but not so much as all the rest of the 'ground-breaking' technology at the Nova factory. Number Five is a robot made for Military Stealth purposes and armed with a laser beam. But designer Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his partner Ben Jabituya (a non-Indian and very funny Fisher Stevens) originally designed him as a marital aid, apparently. They are unhappy with the way Nova has marketed the robot but after a demonstration to the Military, Five is struck by lightning and assumes consciousness. Needing input and desperate to learn more about his surroundings, he escapes the factory and journey's across Oregon, soaking up knowledge and the idiosyncrasies of modern human culture. As a reflection of today's 'zany' society, Five is full of spirit, personality and random pop-culture references.The Military are kinda annoyed at a potential lethal weapon (not the Mel Gibson kind) running loose about America, so it's their new mission to find him and destroy him. Five, who has been taken in by animal-lover (not in THAT way) Stephanie Speck (a gorgeous Ally Sheedy) does everything he can to stay out of harm's way. But they are persistent and won't let him live because they don't believe he is truly alive.It's not totally original since some of it feels inspired by the works of Issac Asamov and I doubt a film like this would have been green-lighted had E.T. not been so successful. But it is very enjoyable and funny and Johnny Five is a great character despite being nothing more than a puppet. Short Circuit is definitely a film for any kid born in the 80s. The video-game obsessed kids of today might to be so interested but its charming simplicity and good-natured story will never really date despite the old-fashioned 'cutting-edge' technology featured in the film.

When one of the robots (number 5) gets struck by lightening, the lab technicians are relieved when it still appears to be functioning. However the lightening has caused Number 5 to malfunction and he wanders off base seeking input. While the military pursue him Number 5 hides out with animal lover Stephanie. Meanwhile the robot creators Newton and Ben realise that something special has happened to their robot.Although it is not in any means ET, Johnny Five is a cool creation that makes for an enjoyably silly film. It isn't brilliant at all of course but I must admit that I am a bit biased because this came out when I was about 10 years old and was easily won over the robot and the effects so I probably like it now more than I should. The plot is an uneasy mix of wartime ethics, 80's romance and discussion on the nature of being human. It will not send you home pondering bigger questions but the message is writ large so children will easily follow along with it. It is silly from start to finish but it does work well on this level although for an adult audience, Johnny Five will probably either be charmingly endearing or painfully grating.Aside from Blaney's voice work the rest of the cast are mixed although mostly at home in this light entertainment vehicle. I was a bit disturbed to find two Police Academy actors in this but of them Guttenberg is the more natural and manages to avoid being too smug and annoying (which is something he doesn't avoid easily). Bailey is less convincing and is more simplistic and he did put me off by essentially doing his PA role. Sheedy is basic but surprisingly natural and has a good chemistry with Guttenberg that does cover up the weaknesses in their romance subplot. One surprisingly uncomfortable casting choice is Stevens, who for some reason has had his skin painted so he can deliver a pathetically stupid Indian stereotype. He provides some laughs for children and, although I appreciate I'm looking with modern eyes, it is hard to overlook this clanger.Overall then this is an amusing little film that falls a long way short of being ET; it is distracting and a good family film even if it is clearly more for children than adults.

Having re-watched recently, the magic's sorta worn off, but it was still an excellent film. You will thoroughly enjoy this if you like the idea of a humanised robot with real emotions. It's sorta funny to note how both #5 and Stephanie are slightly naive, and how #5 translates everything into computer language. upon walking in on Stephanie in the bath nice software! lmao. Also while kids while easily identify Skroeder as the bad guy, adults and teens will recognise how he has basically become more of a machine than the robots he works with because of his inhumanly cold, ruthless attitude.

Each one is armed with a laser for military purposes. There was a ceremony for the robots that day and presiding was the head of Nova, Dr. Howard Marner. The one who designed the robots was shy Dr. Newton Crosby. The five robots stood out back. Number 5 was on the generator when suddenly there was a thunderclap followed by lightning that struck the generator and flowed into Number 5. He seemed okay. He rolled after the other robots then wandered around on his own. He then found his way outside the gate. Crosby, Marner and the others soon learn what had happened. Sergeant Skroeder of security wanted to destroy it due to the laser was still armed but Crosby and Marner were against that. Outside, Number 5 rolled down the street when suddenly he was being chased by Skroeder's men. They were now on a bridge and Number 5 accidentally rolled off. Luckily his chute opened and he sailed on top of a catering truck belonging to Stephanie Speck, an animal lover. When they reach her house, she has to chase off her cruel ex-boyfriend Frank. She meets Number 5 that night and takes him for an extra terrestrial. She shows him around and talk about speed reading! Number 5 can read a book in a one-tenth of a second!         Crosby and his assistant Ben Jabituya wanted to go out and find Number 5 themselves. They took Number 1 with them and drove off. Back at Stephanie's, Number 5 had watched TV all night and obsorbed all the commercial input. Stephanie then showed him her animals, but he was scared by her dog and fell off the balcony. It was then that Stephanie found out that Number 5 wasn't an alien, but a robot. She was about to call Nova when Number 5 became afraid! He was afraid that Nova would disassemble him. Disassemble = death! Number 5 jumped in Stephanie's truck and drove off! He read the manual in a second! Stephanie followed. Crosby and Ben were right behind them. Number 5 was definitely not the world's greatest driver. He swerved all over the place and was just inches from driving them into the river. Skroeder and his troops arrive then also. Crosby, Ben and Skroeder don't believe Stephanie when she says Number 5 is alive! Crosby deactivates him, loads him in the truck and they drive off. But since a life force was given to Number 5, he came alive in the truck and commendeered it and went back to Stephanie. When Frank learned there was a $25,000 reward for Number 5, he went to Stephanie's and tried to shoot it, but Number 5 used his laser to render Frank pantsless.         Crosby and Ben went out again, much against Marner's orders. Stephanie agrees to meet with Crosby. Unfortunately Skroeder planned to interfere so while Stephanie and Crosby talked, Number 1, Number 2 and Number 3 were deployed. Number 5 was able to stop them, deactivate them and reprogram them. Stephanie and Number 5 escape when Skroeder arrives. Crosby follows them and they begin to get to know one another. Skroder and his men arrive then with helicopters, or hueys! Number 5 made a run for it but missiles were fired and blew Number 5 to bits. Stephanie and Crosby drive away distraught when suddenly they see Number 5 in back of the truck! He had built a copy of himself from the spare parts in the truck. So the gang decide to drive to Montana because Crosby had inherited 40 acres. Perfect for Number 5 to hide in, so Number 5 took the wheel and the friends headed for their new life.        A pretty good movie. I recommend it for robot fans! Steve Guttenberg is Newton Crosby, Ally Sheedy is Stephanie, Fisher Steven is Ben and his character was somewhat annoying! Austin Pendleton is Dr. Marner and G.W. Bailey is Skroeder. Guttenberg and Bailey were together in the Police Academy series. Well, Guttenberg was in the first four. Tim Blaney voices Number 5. You may know him as the voice of Frank the Pug in Men in Black! Short Circuit was followed by Short Circuit 2 in 1988. I haven't seen it yet but I will very soon so until then, I recommend Short Circuit. Oh, one more question. What ever happened to Number 4? They didn't show that one going after Number 5, just 1, 2 and 3. So where has Number 4 gone? Perhaps that's another story. Anyway, I recommend Short Circuit!- "}{"Title":"Frankenstein Gets a 1980s Update","Date":"4 November 2000","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Short Circuit is a watchable film about a military robot who gets zapped by lightning one day and develops a mind of his own ala Frankenstein.

With the company who built him, Nova, out to get him because they think he has malfunctioned, technician Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and animal lover Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy) are on a mission to save Number 5 from being reprogrammed.After watching this movie in its entirety as an adult, I, unfortunately, was not impressed with the film. The movie takes a very long time to gain any steam, if any, and there is really no plot, just Number 5 befriending Stephanie while Nova is out to get him - no twists or turns and no unpredictable moments. I could live with movies with simple or no basic plot lines if there are any redeeming qualities like humor, comic relief, likable characters and action. This movie, to me, doesn't deliver on any of those. The so-called comedy is unfunny, the action is dull and the characters were extremely annoying.Ally Sheedy's Stephanie Speck character was loud, obnoxious, overbearing and developed no chemistry with lead Steve Guttenberg; Fisher Stevens' Ben Jabituya character was very lame with his dumb, stereotypical Indian accent and unfunny jokes; Austin Pendleton's Howard Marner character was overly-excited; and G.W. Bailey's Skroeder character was over-asserted as the supposed villain. Only Steve Guttenberg, Brian McNamara and Number 5, which I thought was pretty cool, had any likable qualities.Overall, though, this movie is dull and boring with pretty awful acting.

When I was a lad I thought this was a cool movie. Looking back it was okay but not as good as it used to be. A military robot rebels against it's masters and goes out on it's own. It's your typical P.G. rated comedy with some slapstick childish humor mixed in with some light adult language as well. Now what's an 80's movie without Ally Sheedy or Steve Guttenberg? (this time you have both!) Short Circuit was made during the time period when Ally Sheedy was an attractive lass. She stars as the lady who harbors the robot (named Johnny-5). Steve Guttenberg stars as the Military engineer who designed it. Fisher Stevens co-stars as his East Indian assistant.It's a harmless film that worth a watch. The robot was kind of cool and the comedy is funny at times. Short Circuit was followed by the obligatory 80's sequel (I guess it made a slight profit for it to warrant one).Fair.The sequel is real bad and not worth watching.

Why else would the producers choose such a bland leading man so obviously past his Boys-From-Brazil bankable days?  Just as The Riddler is there to distract us from the sordid male-only fantasy-club world of Bruce and Robin, so too Guttenburg is there to distract us from the truth that lies in the dark, dark heart of this offensive film.This is not a love story, this is the sick, sick tale of a robot's lust for a human women.  Why can't they go for their own kind?  I would never fall in love with a robot, unless it was truly beautiful, and soft.If this is the way robot's are going to behave, then perhaps we should dismantle them and send them back to where they came from before it is too late.  We must, at the very least, take steps preventing them from infiltrating our society, and causing the mayhem they are designed for.  I suggest re-programming camps or something similar.Avoid this film unless you seek moral corruption.
