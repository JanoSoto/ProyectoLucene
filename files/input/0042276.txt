Cukor did something that is seldom done with any film He decided to rehearse `Born Yesterday' as if it were a play (which it was on Broadway and of which Judy Holliday performed the role of Billie Dawn 1,200 times) and had a complete theater built on one of the studio's soundstages and filled it with an audience so he could perfectly time the laughs and the pauses so the movie-going public wouldn't miss a thing.This bit of directing genius is part of what is responsible for the remarkable film that is `Born Yesterday.'The other part of the equation is the casting of Broderick Crawford as the slimy, junk dealer turned multi-millionaire, Harry Brock.Rita Hayworth was originally slated to star as Billie Dawn but when she married Ally Khan and put her screen career on hold the producers ran through an entire list of potential candidates&#133;  It was only with great reluctance that they finally decided to use Judy Holliday in the role she created on Broadway &#150; not believing she was a big enough `name' to pull in audiences. Lucky break for them  She went on to win the first Oscar ever awarded to an actress for a comedic role.

In 20/20 hindsight, have there not been enough scenery-chewing, over-the-top dramatics that have won Academy Awards over the years?  Even the least of actors acknowledge that comedy is more difficult to play well than drama.When I watch Born Yesterday - I KNOW I'm observing two masters at work  Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford.  (Holden gives a good performance, of course, but can't hold a light to his co-stars in this particular project.)  Holliday is mesmerizing with every expression, every screechy syllable - and watch those hands during the gin game!  Perfection in each gesture.  Crawford pulls off a nifty trick by making the viewer simultaneously loathe and feel compassion for his character.Although she died before I was even a twinkle in my mother's eye, I think I could have hung out with Judy Holliday (nee' Judith Tuvim.)  I like intelligent people, and I've read that she was a brilliant woman.  Makes sense  it takes some serious smarts to play so dumb.  She was a funnier Marilyn before there WAS a Marilyn.  Partially because she died so young, and partially because of her refusal to play patty-cake with the HUAC, she is now an under-appreciated memory.

She actually made more than nine, but several of them (prior to Adam's Rib) were actually small roles or small pictures - including (interestingly enough) Too Much Johnson a film that was made by Orson Welles for a Broadway comedy he was directing in 1938. From Adam's Rib through The Bells Are Ringing Judy managed to demonstrate she was a gifted comic actress, a good dramatic actress, and a fine, even sexy musical comedy star. She would even win an Oscar for her second starring role (Born Yesterday - the currently reviewed movie). This should have guaranteed some degree of posthumous movie glory. It does to those who take the trouble of watching her performances, but most of her films are rarely shown (or, in the case of Adam's Rib they are shown because the real stars are Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn; and The Bells Are Ringing is recalled as one of Vincent Minelli's musicals). Judy died of cancer in 1965, much too young. Had she lived twenty or thirty more years (even up to the present) her filmography would have been longer and more elaborate. A decade's worth of good performances is too dependent on the tastes associated with that decade. And Judy will always be part of the Eisenhower years - not the most glamorous period of our history.Born Yesterday was a play by Garson Kanin, dealing with an unscrupulous, self-made scrap metal dealer and millionaire named Harry Brock. On Broadway, the part was played by Paul Douglas opposite Judy, and apparently they did not get along too well. Yet their stage chemistry worked, and the show ran for four years. Oddly enough, when the film was made, Douglas was not the star - the role went to Broderick Crawford (who had won the Oscar for best actor in All The King's Men the previous year. Yet six years later, Douglas did very well as McKeever, the Wall Street corporate leader, opposite Judy as Laura Partridge, in The Solid Gold Cadillac. In retrospect it would have been interesting seeing Douglas play a more violent type, but Crawford does quite nicely as the street smart Harry.Harry, Billie Dawn (Judy - his girlfriend), and his bodyguard/cousin Eddie come to Washington, D.C. Harry wants to expand his scrap iron - garbage dump empire by getting legislation passed allowing him an exception to certain tariffs and taxes. This requires his bribing a Congressman (Larry Oliver) who might sway the required committee in changing the law. Supervising this is Harry's lawyer Jim Devery (Howard St. John), an alcoholic who was once quite promising as a legal scholar (he was close to the great associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, whom he says was his god). But Harry, although rather rough himself in manners, decides that Billie should sharpen her image. She seems too naive, but it is actually that she has never been stimulated (certainly not by the rough, unread, uncultured Harry). Harry has attracted the attention of a reporter named Paul Verrall (William Holden), and on Devery's suggestion, he hires Verrall to transform Billie into a socially acceptable girlfriend.Paul and Billie fall in love, of course, and the education works too well. In fact, while comparable to Eliza Doolittle's education by Henry Higgins it is actually different. Eliza gains a firmer grasp on her self respect because her speech and manners improve. But she never questions the social order of things, or Higgins' political and economic views. That's because Eliza is never trained to be thinking that widely. But Billie is - Paul has her reading books, and looking up words. His education is far more sweeping. As a result, she starts questioning what Harry and Devery are doing in Washington - which Harry is not very happy about.Born Yesterday works due to the acting of Holliday, Crawford (who for all his roughness is funny - see his constant frustration playing gin with Billie), Holden, and St. John. It ends up as reaffirmation of democracy over corruption, and of the possibility of an individual to grow. And it did set the stage for Holliday's screen personae as the urbanite whose humanity and intelligence won out in the end.

The movie presents an interesting aspect for today's audiences, as things related to the film have been in the news lately, making the film relevant.The comedy by Garson Kanin ran for years on the New York stage. Judy Holliday had starred on Broadway opposite Paul Douglas. For the movie version Broderick Crawford was selected. George Cukor directed with his well known style and getting excellent performances of this ideal cast.The film is the gem it is because the great star turn by Judy Holliday, an actress that was unique in everything she did. Billie Dawn was one of the best achievements in the movies. Ms. Holliday was an intelligent actress who knew what made her character work. She made a wonderful contribution with Billie, who in spite of being supposed to be a girl without brains, Ms. Holliday shows her to be a smart no-nonsense woman with more common sense than anyone could give her credit for.Broderick Crawford made quite an impression as the ruthless Harry Brock, a man that can't see the goodness in Billie. He constantly belittles her and even goes as far as slapping her on occasion, but that is what someone like him would normally do when he can't get his way, or thinks is being threatened by a woman like Billie. Mr. Crawford was a wonderful actor as proved in his appearances in Fellini's Il bidone, and in All the President's Men.The other good performance was William Holden, who as Paul Verrall, transforms Billie from an abused woman into someone that is not afraid to open her mouth against the bully that has been taken her for granted for a long time. Mr. Holden clearly understood the man he was playing and makes a wonderful match for Ms. Holliday.Born Yesterday is a fun film to watch because all the elements that went into it and the inspired direction George Cukor and the ensemble work of the cast, but especially from its star, Judy Holliday.

Hilarious! How often do we get to see a perfect performance? We're closing in on a century of movies and, as we can see, it's pretty rare. So flawless was Judy Holliday's portrayal of Billie Dawn that, as a relative unknown, she came from behind to beat out two heavyweights for the Oscar in 1950. I'm sure this was due in no small part to her refining the role for nearly three years on stage.Everything else fell into place as well. Broderick Crawford was just excellent as Harry Brock. Crawford is able to swing you back and forth between anger and sympathy for his character. Not an easy task! William Holden is perfectly calm and reserved as Paul Verrall. His character forms a wonderful opposite to Billie. And, with direction, George Cukor worked his usual magic.Most of the themes are timeless. A person lives in ignorant bliss until their eyes are opened. They realize that there is a better life for them and begin their struggle for improvement. They discover that their greatest opponents to advancement are not those above them, but those at their current level.A few of the elements are dated. Particularly Jim's speech about how hard it is to find a corrupt politician in Washington. Wow. Maybe that was the case in 1950. Now it's impossible to find an honest one.It all comes back to Judy Holliday. This movie is her vehicle. She was a rare talent who we were only able to see for a very short time.

As a gangster's moll who gradually awakens to her civic responsibility, Holliday expands her dumb-broad persona from her previous film with Cukor, Adam's Rib, into a character who's sweet, memorable and surprisingly tough.Born Yesterday is a suitable companion piece to Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, a much more self-consciously important film that imparts similar messages about political corruption and the responsibility of individuals to require ethical governance. The message is arguably more powerfully imparted here - filtered through the perspective of the selfish, spoiled and barely-literate Ms. Dawn - than in the film focused on Jimmy Stewart's eloquent (and intimidatingly ethical) Mr. Smith, an everyman who is vastly morally superior to most audience members.William Holden is relaxed and charming as the Henry Higgins-ish newspaper man tasked with opening Billie's eyes and Broderick Crawford is suitably broad and menacingly raspy as her corrupt, vulgar boyfriend. However, the movie is all Holliday's from the opening scenes, which play on the audience's lack of familiarity with the actress by presenting her as a refined, statuesque beauty in an extended sequence until, at last, she squawks out her first lines in nearly impenetrable, helium-voiced Brooklynese to hilarious effect.A richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for the newcomer Holliday, despite formidable competition from grande dames Bette Davis (All About Eve) and Gloria Swanson (Sunset Boulevard).

William Holden also shows another of his fittingly played performances as the newspaperman who teaches Judy Holliday's character the better things she's neglected to even try to learn.  Another fine Broadway Hit that is preserved on film. Great acting and dialogue does enhance the quality of a movie and this proves it.

It is not perfect (probably as a result of because of the movie's age and contrast with modern society) but the imperfections could be ignored for it's truly wonderful feeling that reminds me of Mr. Smith goes to Washington.  A movie that should be seen by many politicians and anybody in power.  It's just too bad that this movie came at the time of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve because it seems to have been neglected as of late.   Also, I would like to say to those who say Judy Holliday's performance isn't as deserving against Bette Davis' in All About Eve and Gloria Swanson's in Sunset Boulevard to figure out which one of the roles were the most difficult to play for each particular actress and in fact for any actress.  I'm sure that Gloria Swanson's performance was difficult, but it was seemingly so close to her real life that it doesn't seem so difficult (Although that well known fact made 'Sunset Blvd' a greater Masterpiece).  As for Bette Davis in 'All About Eve', it was also great but not very difficult for her (She never had a bad performance in her movie career).

But usually the Broadway cast never makes it intact. It didn't here, but we were lucky to get Judy Holliday to repeat her acclaimed Broadway role her as Billie Dawn, gal pal of junk tycoon Broderick Crawford. Judy only got the role because Rita Hayworth decided to marry Aly Khan and after testing several others who weren't quite right Harry Cohn decided to go with the original. She rewarded Cohn's late faith with a Best Actress Oscar for 1950.Speaking of Oscars, Cohn had an interesting problem on his hands which he solved with Born Yesterday. Broderick Crawford had brought home an Oscar the year before for All the King's Men. But Crawford was hardly traditional leading man material. But there sure were enough similarities with the dictatorial minded Willie Stark with the tyrannical Harry Brock so that Cohn could cast Crawford and keep the momentum going for his career. Crawford's part was played by Paul Douglas on stage who would get to Hollywood right around this time as well.Still neither Holliday or Crawford were box office and Columbia needed one name that had some guaranteed pull with movie audiences. That's where Bill Holden came in. The part was built up from the Broadway version, all that tourist business at the Capitol and other Washington sites were not on Broadway. The role of the intellectual newspaper reporter was played by Gary Merrill and Merrill was certainly better suited for the part than Holden. Personally I think that Cohn should have gone with his other reliable leading man, Glenn Ford in this part. Still even with the built up role Holden was a definite number three in this film.The plot is very simple, the magic of Born Yesterday is watching Holliday's character grow in awareness of what's around her. She's the play thing of junk tycoon Harry Brock, a self made millionaire who's street smart, rich, and nothing else. He's aware of it though and aware that Holliday lacks the social graces as well.Since Crawford can't or won't learn them, at least he wants a polished hostess to make up for it. He hires newspaper reporter Holden to teach Holliday. But he teaches her about democracy and the corrupting influence of special interests of which Crawford is one and she's now aware of.Crawford also put a lot of his holdings in her name for tax purposes. That's a created situation, Crawford regrets starting.Holliday became so identified with the Billie Dawn role that when she started having blacklisting problems due to her left wing politics, she went into character as Billie Dawn before Congress. The chumps in Congress actually bought it all and she skated. Actually in real life Holliday was a well read intelligent woman, the last thing from Billie Dawn you could imagine.Judy Holliday spent the remainder of her career between Broadway and Hollywood so her film output remains small and she died way too young. Still as another uneducated character in a film said, what there is, is cherce.Born Yesterday is as cherce as it gets.

William Holden, as always, is very good in his role; this time he is the reporter hired to refine Holiday but falls in love with her.

In black-and-white, there are some physical resemblances between the two, but Holliday's comedy in this picture is nuanced, rather than milked. It's a surprise, but a nice one, to read that she beat out two famous performers in two dramatic films--Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve--to take Best Actress Oscar for this comic role.Holliday and Broderick Crawford's funny voices--perpetually raised and in a key of harsh could have been awful, but they remain hilarious from front to finish. I admired how the script and the director avoided some obvious, easy to imagine pitfalls with this story arc. Holliday's character may have an intellectual and moral awakening, but she's still swapping loud brash repartee with her Harry all the way through.At points, this picture made me think of some of my favourite French films in which minor or unglamorous characters, who would occupy cinematic bit parts in most movies are pushed into the spotlight for a closer look.

Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford look like they came out of a prequel to Dumb and Dumber. And William Holden is wishy washy, never clearly defining his character or motivation for any of the things he is doing, aside from getting laid by a not especially pretty moll of a gangster, which is a pretty darn stupid thing to do for a supposedly in the know Washington reporter. (This is either a violation of basic journalistic ethics or a deposit on some concrete galoshes.)Neither Holden nor Holliday fit their parts. Put Marilyn Monroe and Kirk Douglas in them and this might sizzle. Monroe knew how to play the dual levels of a smart inner dame and an outer ditsy dame, as seen in Bus Stop. And Douglas wrote the book on cynical reporting in Ace in the Hole. As it is, there is no chemistry between them, zero, and none between Holliday and Crawford, either. Crawford really loves Holliday? Why? She is as charming as screeching chalk on a blackboard.So Cukor rehearsed the cast before a live audience to get the timing. That might have had some relevance when this was shown in a theater. But on home video half a century later all this cast produces is puzzled silence.I suppose there was something edgy about taking on political corruption in a more innocent time. Except it had been done, far better, two years before in State of the Union, and earlier by Frank Capra in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Meet John Doe.

And the bluster ends up being a foil for something tender and possibly tragic, a turnaround that defies the almost screwball beginning. Or so it seems as you go.It's partly Judy Holliday's character, and performance, that keep you glued. She might seem a caricature at first, but there is a lot of subtlety to her acting--watch the hands, the eyes looking away, even her whole body, which isn't a tart looking for attention, but someone uncomfortable where she is. And the Holden character, a writer of some kind who seems to have fallen into a scoop of surprising dimensions, makes the most of the situation. Cukor isn't only a director of women of course, he's a master at storytelling. That's what really shows here. It's fast without being dizzying. It's interesting, and human, and funny enough and rich enough to hold the line through even some rough patches.

So, he has the bright idea of hiring newspaperman William Holden to give her sophistication. Unfortunately, in the process, he infuses her with a thirst for knowledge and she ultimately realizes what a degenerate Crawford is and that she can do much better than wait for him to eventually marry her.While this was an Oscar-winning film and I did enjoy it, I was struck by many things that confused me. First, it wasn't THAT great a film and the hype around it seems out of proportion to the film. Second, while I have often heard it described as a comedy, the film isn't really a comedy at all--despite having a few mildly funny moments. That's because although this could have been a great film, it was often way too serious and cruel to be laughed at--especially when Craword and Holliday did a very vivid scene where he beat her. I am an ex-therapist (now teaching) and seeing her slapped around was very, very disturbing to me--probably because I used to work with people who did that. It didn't bother my wife, as she said this furthered the plot, but I was left shaken as will many who have experienced abuse or know others who have. To me, spousal or partner abuse kill comedies--it just can't be funny. Now this did NOT ruin the film--it just made it tough for me to watch a few scenes.As for the rest of the film, it was generally very good--though Crawford's character seemed so evil and awful that he seemed tough to believe.

Sure he cares but his treatment of her borders on the repulsive whilst still managing to get the ribs tickled, Brock worries that her dumbness will do down important business issues socially, so he arranges for the calm and well spoken Paul Verrall to be her chaperon and train her to be eloquent and more astute of the world and its history.The film then becomes your standard Pygmalion story as the nice but dim Billie not only learns about the world she lives in, she also learns about the world SHE HAS been living in, and coupled with the sexual awakening she finds with Verrall this fills out the rest of the story. It's full of delightful scenes that linger long in the memory, and outside of Holliday's brilliant performance, we get a wonderful example of the polar opposite Male love interest, Broderick Crawford as Brock is a maelstrom of shouting daftness, a man that makes you cringe such is his buffoonery. On the other hand we get the serene and well mannered Verrall played with the right amount of pathos by William Holden, and it is with much credit that amongst the loud brash shows from the other stars, he remains more than a distant memory.The comedy here will make you cringe one minute, and then have you giggling away the next, all the chief characters here engage you in the way they are meant to, the climax may be a bit too condensed for some but it's a fine ending that befits the previous efforts you have just witnessed, and I defy anyone to not laugh at the gin rummy sequence! 8/10 "},{"Title":"Pretty good, but not worthy of the gushing.","Date":"26 September 2009","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I just finished watching this film, and, on the whole I liked it.

Brock hires journalist Paul Verall (William Holden) to make Billie presentable to Washington, D.C. society but, before long, he decides that Billie's getting too smart for her own good (or, rather, his good).The cast is unquestionably the film's biggest asset. Judy Holliday took home a well-deserved Oscar for her excellent performance as the dim but sweet Billie. Meanwhile, Broderick Crawford gave a performance that's arguably as good as his Oscar-winning performance of a year earlier in All the King's Men. Rounding out the leads was William Holden, who was solid, if not as impressive as his co-stars.The screenplay snagged an Oscar nomination but I found myself less impressed than Academy voters. In particular, I felt that the comedic & romantic elements of the story were overshadowed by the drama surrounding Brock's shady dealings. To me, this was the least interesting aspect of the story, perhaps because it led to some tedious moralizing.On the technical front, the movie showcased first-class production values. George Cukor earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his efforts and Frederick Hollander's score was above average. The Jean Louis costumes also garnered an Oscar nomination.Ultimately, though, I felt that the movie took itself too seriously to completely click as a comedy. That being said, it still managed to get by on the strength of its performances. Thus, I'd recommend it as long as you're not expecting a breezy affair. "},{"Title":"Worth a Closer Look","Date":"20 March 2011","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I expect the movie's serious side took a backseat to Holliday's overpowering comedic performance. Her Billy Dawn is certainly Oscar-worthy in that year's heavy competition. Who can forget the Minnie Mouse voice, the big saucer eyes and sweetly naïve manner. Together, they combine into a career performance in what's a slyly demanding role. But especially, I love that gin game with the exasperated Harry. Billy seems so scatter-brained and he so focused, it's almost like seeing Al Capone get bested by Daffy Duck. What an expert piece of comedic architecture&#x97; in my book, it's the movie's and Crawford's best moments.Speaking of Crawford, he's so consistently loud and abusive, his Harry the junk man (how appropriate) amounts to almost a cartoon character in itself. Director Cukor was known as a woman's director, so maybe that's why Crawford goes over the top. But whatever the reason, he's much too much. The overbearing Harry is supposed to be dislikable but not so dislikable that he becomes a caricature. On a slightly different plane, note how the sexual conventions of the time are slyly finessed&#x97;the sleeping arrangements, Billy's withholding sex after the gin game, the suspicious hundred dollars her dad refuses, etc. These amount to a more suggestive screenplay than usual for that straitjacketed time. As funny as the movie is, it still adds up to more than just an expert amusement. There's a substantial subtext worth remarking on. For example, the moral of the screenplay is a clear one&#x97;no tyranny over people's minds. That lesson, of course, applies to Billy in spades, though she acts it out in highly amusing fashion. As the domineering Harry's silken mistress, she shows a tyrannized, inhibited silence in the film's first part&#x97; which is also why she so cleverly annoys Harry during that delicious card game. The ex-show girl may be a well-kept victim (check out her suitcases in the hotel lobby), but she's a victim no less, not only of Harry's abuse, but of her own difficult background, as well. The trouble is she's also a victim of her own assumptions and expectations about herself.Thus, when writer- educator Paul (Holden) arrives on the scene, he arrives as a potential liberator, bringing her both respect and ideas. But he's got to free her not only from Harry, but from her past dependent self, as well. Those tutoring scenes in the nation's capital with its inscribed democratic ideals are well chosen. The ideals, as we learn, apply not only to nations, but to individuals, as well. So when Billy finally recognizes how the two converge, she opens up a new independence of mind and personhood she never realized were waiting there to be freed. And when she finally leaves Harry for Paul, with just a few clothes, she's in effect chosen the 'happy peasant' over the powerful man (Napoleon) and the movie's moral parable is complete. Nonetheless, there are limits to these lessons. For example, the national monument scenes need not be so reverential since democracy itself remains an ideal, not a religion to be worshipped; at the same time, the 'founding fathers', for all their gifts, were only mortal men and not the gods of a religion. Moreover, the happy peasants of the script don't usually take the risks that drive a history of social and economic progress. Harry may not exemplify this worthy type of risk-taking, but there are limits, I believe, to the 'happy peasant' as a paradigm for an entire society. Of course, the comedic side of the movie means these more serious points can't be made too subtle or controversial, otherwise the funny parts would be undermined. But I can't help wondering just for the fun of it about the casting. Suppose that instead of the handsome Holden as Billy's catalyst, an ordinary looking man were there instead. Then I wonder how Billy would respond. Or instead of the bullying Crawford, suppose someone less good at being obnoxious were cast. But, of course, much of the movie's satisfaction comes from seeing this nasty guy and his plush prison get rejected.None of this is meant to take away from the superb comedic side of the movie. But the exceptional appeal of the material (Kanin and Mannheimer) is that it so neatly combines the laughs into food for thought and both of them into a single entertaining package. But above all, the movie remains a superb showcase for one of the best comediennes of that day or this. What a loss that she died so young. Fortunately, the laughs remain.

Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford eclipse the other cast members (Holden included), and their performances make wonderful viewing. As well as being very entertaining, their characters' tense and abusive relationship is wholly believable. The scene where they play gin rummy is a tour de force of comedy... in fact, Born Yesterday is worth watching for that card game alone... it's quite brilliant.The message at the heart of the film, whilst worthy, does now seem somewhat naive. At one point Howard St John (an enthralling performance as the venal self-loathing attorney Jim Devery) claims that corrupt US senators and congressman are few and far between... well, at best that's a rather rose-tinted view of politics (especially in the US in the 1950s). The beautiful, intelligent and highly talented Judy Holliday later found to her cost that the beacon of freedom that is meant to shine from Capitol Hill doesn't always burn as brightly as this film wished to suggest. Soon after making Born Yesterday she was investigated by the FBI and the US Senate as part of the anti-communist witch hunts. She had an IQ of 172 but at her Senate hearing Judy managed to appear every bit as clueless as her dramatic creation Billie, and so avoided implicating anyone else in the lunacy, whilst at the same time avoiding any major blacklisting for herself.

This Rom-Com really wowed its audiences with its apparent clever wit that had them all literally rolling in the aisles with peals of uncontrollable laughter.But, today, 63 years later - I found this film's somewhat contrived and predictable story to be repeatedly teetering on the very edge of being just a one-note joke that got mighty stale after just the first half-hour.At the start Judy Holliday's Billie Dawn character (in all of its crudeness and its cluelessness) was kind of cute and amusing - But, it certainly didn't take long for the loud-mouthed brassiness of her character to grate on my nerves like you wouldn't believe.It certainly seemed to me that the more Billie got educated (which seemed to happen at about warp speed) the more annoying and downright tiresome she became. And I also found that she proved, in the end, to be way too smart to have actually been as unbelievably dumb as she was initially perceived to be.I personally thought that Holliday was badly miscast as the Billie character. Not only did she lack any conviction in her overall performance, but, she was painfully deficient of any sexual appeal, as well.I think that this was the sort of role meant for an actress with the dynamic screen-presence of Marilyn Monroe, which Holliday obviously lacked.Besides Holliday not being able to cut the mustard in this comedy, I also thought that Broderick Crawford was a repulsive bore as the big-mouthed bully-of-a-billionaire and William Holden as the true-blue, little news-reporter was far too wishy-washy for my liking.All-in-all - Born Yesterday was just a so-so comedy that really baffles me in regards to it huge popularity back in its heyday.

Her filmography consists of about 13 films, and then she died in 1965 of breast cancer. Indeed, had she been fortunate enough to live further she probably would have had a more illustrious career than she already had. 1950 was her best year as she got the starring role in Born Yesterday, mostly thanks to Katharine Hepburn, who she worked with on Adam's Rib and impressed so much that Hepburn pushed for her name to get publicity and fame.Based on a play by one of the screenwriters of Adam's Rib, Born Yesterday is a rather refreshing look at the game of politics as well as American society and its views of education. Holliday is wonderful as Billie Dawn, an uneducated and mostly subdued woman taken under the wing of a powerful, loud, boisterous steel tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who basically controls her every move. Wanting to impress the people he hopes to work with, this Mr. Brock hires a smart but controversial reporter played very straight and forward by William Holden, one of the most underrated stars of the early 20th century.In a movie like this with actors like Holliday and Holden, love is never far away. Yet, one of the things I loved about this film is that love is not the focal point of this relationship or the plot. Their attraction is immediate, but they put it aside for something more important; the education of this woman who has been under the foot of a man and never seemed to understand about the world outside of her own. As the two take tours of Washington DC and read books and newspapers, information and knowledge abound, especially about what the well-off Mr. Brock is doing in the nation's capital.This is Holliday's most celebrated role (she won the Oscar that year over Gloria Swanson and Bette Davis) and she certainly was the best choice for it. Her platinum blonde looks and New York accent strike well against the new-found knowledge she receives in this movie. Holden is good here as an idealistic and ambitious writer who never goes too far, always staying true to himself and being a solid character for the audience to follow. Crawford is also quite good as the tycoon believing everything can be taken by force except for intellectual. There is a lot of talk about the importance of knowing about our nation's government and the things that go on in it. Watching it, I never felt it was more prevalent than today. This is certainly a warm and funny comedy. But it also has a brain and something to say. Certainly that is a rarity.

When course, oafish, inexplicably wealthy junk dealer Harry Brock (jowly Broderick Crawford) decides to hit Washington DC to suck up to politicians (and more, as we'll find out), he realizes his lisping, uncultured, gum-smacking fiancée Billie (Holliday) will make a wretched first impression. Despite the fact that Harry himself makes dumb broad Billie look like Marie Curie, he pays writer Paul Verral (Holden), a quintessential '50s nerd with horn-rimmed glasses and Byrlcreem saturated hair, to play Henry Higgins to Billie's Eliza. As Billie's interest in politics (and Paul) grows, she does indeed smarten up... and becomes a force to be reckoned with, much to Harry's chagrin.What I found remarkable is that the setup is nothing like modern bet comedies (like She's All That). Billie knows from the beginning that Paul is being paid to teach her. This also isn't your typical makeover comedy yes, Billie learns to talk good, to understand to workings of politics, and to read on her own free will (my favorite scene is when, stuck for an insult at Harry's expense, she runs to her massive dictionary before spitting out antisocial!!), but our heroine learns so much more. She learns to read the fine print on the papers Harry makes her sign. She learns to question Harry's shabby treatment of her, his morals, and her own place in life... and she decides that she doesn't like any of them. In the end, Billie uses knowledge to escape her abusive relationship, develop self-respect, and win a man truly worthy of her affection.Holliday is both hilarious and sympathetic as Billie, and a reminder of a bygone era when women were not only genuinely funny, but weren't a size 0. Holliday gets to strut her stuff and show off her hourglass figure in flamboyant yet sumptuous Jean Louis outfits (I coveted those sparkly pajamas!). Everyone remembers the classic gin rummy scene where Billie wallops Harry at cards with robotic consistency. Crawford and Holden also provide excellent support as two very different men vying for Billie's heart. It's hard to believe that Born Yesterday, the classic comedy about improving the mind, was released right at the beginning of the anti-intellectual '50s. What a waste that no one learned what Billie did that expanding you mind and horizons will help you escape your complacent way of thinking and that you're never too old to learn.

He is a broken down, $25 a week elevator operator in New York, but he has the life values in which Harry is totally lacking. With the help of her tutor, she comes to realize that it is character, not wealth or power, that matters.

William Holden appears bored most of the time, and Broderick Crawford is consummate as always.The whole premise of a ditsy but stage-smart gold-digger turning herself around intellectually and morally in such a short period of time and then questioning every aspect of her very existence and of the institutions that she lives in- came off as very unbelievable to me.

(1950, 9/10), the juggernaut presence of Bette Davis and the supreme Anne Baxter in the iconic ALL ABOUT EVE (1950, 9/10), while I have yet to see Eleanor Parker in CAGED (1950), but the eventual winner is Judy Holliday from George Cukor's chamber piece, who reprises her classic role on the silver screen from Garson Kanin's play. After watching it, notwithstanding that the story doesn't stand the test of time for its conspicuous poetic license to romanticize the tale, by comparison Lewis Gilbert's EDUCATING RITA (1983, 7/10) has been more tellingly realistic, Holliday's performance is deservingly a sensation to behold (the golden-age charisma is certainly unparalleled and ravishing for my taste), I rank her the runner-up (just below Swanson) of the year so far. Holiday plays Billie Dawn, a loud-mouth, ditsy, ex-showgirl bimbo who has been the fiancée of the equally (if not more) loud-mouth and ditsy tycoon Harry Brock (Crawford) for seven years (people do find their own kinds). Harry is an obnoxious, self-centered upstart whose business germinates from selling junks. They come to Washington D.C. and Harry intends to buy himself a congressman with the aid of the materialistic lawyer Jim Devery (St. John). After Billie's uncouth manners sabotage a formal visit of a congressman, out of the blue, Harry successfully makes the worst decision ever from his cretinous brain, in order to make Billie presentable, he hires a political reporter Paul Verrall (Holden) whom he has just met, to educate her. While being a man with senses of justice, Paul (unbelievably) falls for Billie almost at the first glance, and it turns out the feelings are mutual, as stale as that. Paul recommends books for her, brings her out sightseeing, visiting museums and historical edifices to learn history and art, as two carefree lovebirds. Thus, as everyone expected, the more cultivated Billie becomes, the more disparity emerges between her and Harry, no more playing cards in their harmoniously co-existed scenes (which is accomplished by a marked long take to manifest their low-class wont), Billie gets suspicious of the contacts she is coerced to sign, turns disobedient against Harry's will and pours scorn on his rough behaviors. And in the end, she chooses the more dignified Paul, after a heroic gargantuan-money-refusal act. The story might sound a bit unimpressive on paper, but it goes pretty smoothly on the screen thanks to Cukor's fluid direction in a basically restricted setting and a potent cast, especially, our heroine Judy Holliday. From being a round peg in a square hole, to a good-hearted soul with a morally conscientious spin, Holliday unfolds a captivating turn with her resolved confidence on the screen, allures audience with an imperative urgency to rally behind her metamorphosis; Holden and Crawford unfortunately succumb to more one-dimensional sidekicks around her, a whole stage for an actress when actors retreat to a secondary position, a scene rarely cannot be seen nowadays anymore, so in spite that to some bigots, the film can be misinterpreted as an exemplar of anti-education towards pretty women, yet, for most of the world, it is still relishing to re-value its gender politics under today's climate.

Interestingly, around the time of Born Yesterday, she was found linked to communism and became blacklisted from television and radio for three years. Mysterious!

A theatre production, with the limited scope of the stage, must convey action, place and meaning through its words. A motion picture, being a primarily visual affair, must make its images speak without getting bogged down in too much dialogue. How then to translate a stage play to the screen without giving the script a complete overhaul? Enter director George Cukor. Cukor was undoubtedly the finest director when it came to theatre adaptations, and the studio trusted him well enough to turn him loose on barely adulterated material. He plays some of his neatest tricks in the first twenty minutes. During William Holden's interview with Broderick Crawford, the screen is filled with various flunkies rushing about doing Crawford's business. These are not merely here for background detail &#x96; the camera actually follows them more than it is does Holden and Crawford. It's a lively and cunning way of distracting us from Crawford's words &#x96; it isn't really important that we memorise every fact about this character, more that we get an impression of what he is really about. However in the following scene with Judy Holliday, everything is still and uncluttered, focusing us entirely on her and what she has to say.This is not to put down Garson Kanin's play. Born Yesterday is a beautifully structured piece, wonderfully simple and direct in its delineation of characters and situations. It describes Billie's blossoming as a genius at a credible pace without ever duplicating a moment, with every scene having a slightly different thrust. It's also a refreshingly mature and non-patronizing story of a female emancipation. Feminist purists may point out that Billie is arguably liberated by her male tutor, but she is nevertheless undoubtedly an independent actor in control of her own life, possessing of natural intelligence that was waiting to be given form. Besides, the tale of a stereotypical blonde bimbo getting one over on the chauvinistic boar she lives with is too good to resist.And what makes Billie's story work best of all is her portrayal by real-life blonde intellect Judy Holliday. At first glance Holliday is a graceless, squawking menace, in a similar vein to the Jean Hagen character from Singin' in the Rain. But while Lena Lamont is unquestionably a villain, Holliday makes Billie an engaging and above all likable individual. More than that Holliday skilfully brings out the humanity and touching realism in the caricature. While Holliday subtly feels out her performance, Broderick Crawford is more an actor of gesture and mannerism, filling the space with his larger-than-life presence. Next to these two, William Holden is almost a little bland in his steady professionalism, but this doesn't matter, as it's not his character who is required to shine.When we see a stage to screen adaptation, even a good one, its roots are usually obvious in the long passages of dialogue and lack of scene changes. Born Yesterday however moves with such pace and draws us in so successfully, you could be forgiven for thinking it was written directly for the screen. It is one of Cukor's best and the finest record one could hope for of the seldom-seen talents of Judy Holliday. It also holds its own in a year of so many fine dramas, and deserves to be remembered alongside All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard.

Let's not hold the fact that a dumbass awards group decided her's was the best female performance of the year against her.Given the roles Judy Holliday would become known for playing, Billie Dawn certainly doesn't appear to be much of a stretch for her, but there's no denying that she's captivatingly charming in this lightweight George Cukor comedy. Holliday plays a ding-bat blonde numbskull gangster moll who, tired of her boyfriend's (Broderick Crawford, made a star a year earlier by All the King's Men) constant dismissal of her as just a dumb broad, sets out on an odyssey of self improvement. To help her in her goal, she enlists intellectual and booky William Holden (we know he's intellectual because he wears glasses), who just happens to be drop-dead gorgeous as well (this is Hollywood, folks).This is a sweet movie. I've got a soft spot for any story in which someone identifies his/her own limitations and sets out to improve them against the odds. There's a real excitement in seeing Holliday's character gradually begin to understand the satisfaction a good book can provide or become for the first time in her life legitimately engaged in a serious discussion and have opinions of her own. Holliday and Holden have sizzling chemistry, and even if Holliday isn't delivering Shakespeare, she's still awfully cute to watch.Melanie Griffith did a remake of this movie that I've never seen and never want to--I don't believe for a minute that it can be anything but worse than Cukor's version.

Holden doesn't do much except show up looking handsome; his pre-conceived character is just an outline, and Holden can't do much except be easy and charming. The jaunts to the usual D.C. sites have a faint whiff of superficiality (with Holliday's Billie getting fired up over seeing The Constitution), but at least the picture still has some comic drive. By the final act, the writing is too faithful to the play, wrapping things up in a stale, obvious fashion. Billie gets a sweet, funny send-off, but the film is a cut-and-paste job, with a smarter-than-thou sheen which leaves some dissatisfaction behind. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"I can see why she beat Bette & Gloria","Date":"9 June 2003","Score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I must say I was very surprised when I watched this movie.

Her Oscar-winning performance as Billie Dawn is the highlight of this film. Still, Broderick Crawford as Harry Brock lends much energy to help drive this film. Made from a highly successful Broadway play, Born Yesterday touches on several social issues of the day. The ditzy blonde from a chorus line who becomes a paramour of a rich businessman. The greedy man of new riches who rose from the streets on his own, doing anything to others to get where he got &#x96; with no apparent conscience or care for anyone else. The self-centered but insecure big man who thinks he can buy his way into or out of anything. The loud, demanding lout who lavishes jewels and furs on his kitten one moment and the next is abusing her with vitriol or physical strikes. Into this crazy twosome comes William Holden's Paul Verrall. I liked Holden in this reserved role, and I think many reviewers may have missed something about his part. I see his character, with a sense of humor and calm reality about him, as a leveler in the action and drama. Without his easy-going and unintimidated poise, I think the violent nature of Harry Brock would have over-powered the film. Perhaps to the point that audiences &#x96; women especially, would find this much too brutal a character. But, Holden's cool Verrall doesn't jump through hoops for Brock, as Brock is used to so many others doing. Instead Verrall faces Brock, aware that the big man could pulverize him physically, but unafraid nevertheless. As a result, Brock backs off and he goes off muttering about the faults of everyone else. Howard St. John does a very good job as Jim Devery, Brock's legal beagle and lawyer on call. He keeps his conscience in check with alcohol. And, Larry Oliver as Norval Hedges plays a member of congress trying to help an obviously big contributor get an amendment to a bill that will greatly benefit his business. I understand that the Broadway role of Holden's part was greatly enhanced since he was the biggest drawing card for the film. But that's OK, as I noted above. He didn't steal the thunder of Holliday or Crawford, but he was a catalyst that seemed to keep the big boss from going completely berserk. The movie makers knew what they were doing in the casting and scripting of this film. Judy Holliday was a very talented actress who died of breast cancer in 1965 at age 43. She had only 16 films to her credit, but several were tremendous movies. She surely would have had many more fine roles had she lived longer. A favorite scene from this film was of Billie and Harry playing gin rummy. The looks on his face are a hoot as she picks up and quickly moves cards around in her hand. Within a few cards or picks from the pile, she lays her hand down with gin. Then, his shady character quickly counts off the cards he's stuck with in his hand, 28 one time, 34 another, and so on. We all know he's cheating, and she knows it too, repeating his count rhetorically, and he restating it as fact. What a riot as the uneducated not-so-dumb blonde takes the big man (also uneducated) to the cleaners.After reading, visiting museums, and studying a great deal with Verrall as her tutor, Billie would make a remark that showed her new knowledge. But often, she would utter a malapropism. One of my favorites was a line toward the end of the film when she stands up to Harry and his crooked ways. Verrall corrects the word, and she repeats it, but the humor is in the original utterance This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhibit (sic) it.

These labels designate women as either asinine or intelligent. The claim that a woman is asinine that has not hitherto subscribed to reading books as seen in Born Yesterday is calumnious.Extrapolating from Karl Marx remark that education is nothing but 'brain washing' and as such a form of tyranny, thus potentially making adherence to books asinine. The ability to read a book is not a skill that decides that you are cognisant. No, being smart is, especially for a woman, the way she survives in a man's world, as seen in this film. Now that the books have replaced Harry Brock's (Broderick Crawford) character, and as such they have become the tool that Paul Verrall (William Holden) utilises as a means to re-shape his ideal doll as in Billy Dawn (Judy Holiday). In this respect Verrall is akin to the men who endeavour to mold their wives into their ideal respective women in The Stepford Wives (1975)Like in Mr. Smith Goes To Washinton (1939), director George Cuckor borrows from Frank Capra to reach a high moral ground that with a sense of irony if not hypocrisy dictates what is moral, right and wrong in Born Yesterday. As such it defines for the viewer what tyranny is. Whereas the books and fancy words of the educated, such as that of acclaimed Englishman idealist Tom Pain (mentioned in the film)are used to manipulate and corrupt our minds for their own ends, Harry Brock uses his brawn and wealth to accomplish his goals with what his poverty stricken childhood has given him (because an exclusive education was inaccessible to the lower orders of society to which he originally belonged, and still does from an intellectual elitist's perspective) in the survival of the fittest. The difference is that Brock's illegal methods make his corruption more overt and to that extent more honest in an ironic sense. This is an extrapolation of the idea that there is a sense of morality within corruption if the viewer looks hard enough, as seen in Force Of Evil (1948).Though women should not have to play dumb, as this film illustrates it is an acting achievement that can only be accomplished by the acclaimed Judy Holiday.This is an interesting film that defines morality and intelligence for the astute viewer to question.

It's well-written, the acting is very, very good, and the plot comes to a satisfactory conclusion. Broderick Crawford plays Harry Brock, the junk king, in town with his lawyer to buy some legislation. Billy, his girlfriend, played by Judy Holiday, is a diamond in the rough, and he hires a journalist, Paul, played by William Holden, to teach her a few of the things she'll need to know to make a good impression in Washington. Paul and Billy fall in love, and there's trouble brewing for Harry Brock. During the tutoring process,Paul and Billy visit the memorial for Thomas Jefferson, the Smithsonian, Congressional buildings, and the like. He hounds her (gently) into using the dictionary, discovering what words actually mean. He educates her a bit in U.S. political history, with an emphasis on the Bill of Rights (Paul would be aghast at the current attacks on that document). He gets Billy to read some history, particularly Thomas Paine. At one point they're discussing selfishness (Harry Brock, the character played by Broderick Crawford, is selfishness incarnate). Paul makes a speech about how selfishness, if put in practice by our elected officials, leads to fascism. Paul doesn't seem to buy the current dictum that 'greed is good.' Later in the film, Harry Brock's lawyer informs him that he can't just go around Washington buying Congresspeople--nearly all of them are hardworking, honest people who take their legislative positions seriously. The comparison between that situation and the current climate of open corruption in Congress is a stark lesson for us all. This sort of political commentary will not be seen again in American films, at least not the Hollywood sort. The fact that this film was a very popular light comedy makes it all the more remarkable. Apparently Americans in the Fifties took their rights for granted, and expected honesty and forthrightness from their elected officials. Journalists like Paul comprised an honest, truth-seeking profession, not mere corporate embeds playing reporter. I enjoyed the film's story, but I was deeply saddened by the depiction of what this country once was, and what we have lost. It's a worthwhile film. See it, if you get the chance.

Basically Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) is a loud-mouth junkyard tycoon who plans to buy himself a congressman or two. He brings with him his mistress girlfriend, ex-showgirl, and pretty naive Emma 'Billie' Dawn (Oscar and Golden Globe winning - also nominated GG for Drama - Judy Holliday). Brock hires newspaperman Paul Verrall (The Bridge on the River Kwai's William Holden) to try and get her educated and softened enough to be more presentable in capital society, mainly helping her to understand the American Constitution and history, and anything else she reads but doesn't get the meaning of (including some of Paul's articles). But Harry gets more than he bargained for as Billie gains more knowledge, and has ultimately fallen for her tutor, she has become confident enough to realise Harry's a no good, two-bit, corrupt crook. It all comes to a head when Billie refuses to sign anymore documents concerning her assets, she finally escapes from Harry's domination, and Harry signs over the assets to her to hide them from the government, and she promises Harry to give them back little by little, as long as he leaves her and Paul alone. Also starring Howard St. John as Jim Devery, Frank Otto as Eddie, Larry Oliver as Congressman Norval Hedges, Barbara Brown as Mrs. Hedges, Grandon Rhodes as Sanborn and Claire Carleton as Helen. Holden certainly demonstrates his charm that would swiftly make him a movie legend, Crawford is really good as the loud-mouthed, arrogant and disrespectful crook boyfriend, but the film to me belongs to deserved Oscar winning Holliday. The gin rummy card game is critics favourite, it is certainly fun to watch, Holliday's naive Billie was great, and the independent Billie was good too, her voice reminded me of a lighter and squeakier Janice from Friends, and her charming attitude similar to Marilyn Monroe. A great classic comedy film with plenty of laughs, most coming from Holliday of course.

I give the Academy full marks for their bravery in choosing Holliday's performance in 1950 over the melodrama of those two great acting dames Gloria Swanson (Sunset Boulevard) and Bette Davis (All ABout Eve). Comedy is probably the hardest genre to get right, and Judy shines. She deserved her award. Swanson was fantastic as faded silent movie queen Norma Desmond, but my vote goes with Judy. Votes were split between Davis and her Eve co-star Anne Baxter- Davis surely couldn't have won the award for playing Margo Channing in a film that is titled 'All About Eve'.I'm sick of hearing that Judy's Oscar was a bad choice from the Academy.

Judy Holliday was one of a rare group of actresses who exude warmth even as they crack wise, people like Celeste Holm, Eve Arden, Virginia O'Brien. For once all the elements are top drawer; Garson Kanin worked without credit on this adaptation of his own hit (it ran four years) Broadway play, reluctantly Columbia imported the female lead and lived to give thanks (Paul Douglas played the male lead on Broadway and Gary Merrill the third person in the triangle in what was a much smaller role on stage), whilst I wouldn't have objected if they'd hired Paul Douglas along with Holliday I can do without the wooden Merrill and William Holden takes what is essentially a foil and invests it with charm whilst Brod Crawford grabs the male lead by the scruff of the neck and acts the bejeezus out of it. A certified classic.

Then, the controversy . . .","Date":"30 December 2005","Score":"6 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Born Yesterday is sheer delight. Judy Holliday won Best Actress for her performance. And she's surrounded by Broderick Crawford and William Holden, equally terrific in their roles, and a wonderful cast of supporting players. Garson Kanin's stage play is chock full of great lines. At its heart, this comedy has serious ideas in mind.What's not to love? Nothing, really. Born Yesterday is a classic character comedy/drama with brilliant performances.Yet there's a built-in element that doesn't quite work. It's simply unbelievable, realistically, that a journalist as bright and informed and talented and ambitious as William Holden's character can seriously fall in love with and marry a character as consistently dumb (and happy to BE dumb), as uncouth and strident as Holliday's Billie Dawn.Billie is what used to be called a chippie. Holliday plays her to perfection. The largely silent gin sequence between her and Crawford is justifiably a classic.Crawford is also pitch-perfect as a blustering, ruthless, obnoxious, potentially dangerous fascist (Billie's term) with a soft spot for his chippie.Holden, oddly, is slightly out of place. He's far too smart, too experienced, too centered, genuinely confident and non-neurotic to participate in this supposed triangle of characters.However delightful Bille Dawn is, and she IS delightful, she remains a cheap floosie with no social or intellectual skills or curiosity who's ready for a little action, as she puts it.She's a dumb blonde from the burlesque chorus who's a kept woman, in other words. A dumb whore, to put it less politely. (Whores on film can be wonderful see Melina Mercouri in Never on Sunday.)Holden's character is so superior to her that when they fall in love, one cannot help but think, This is a guy who needs a weak, cheap woman so he can feel superior. After all, he's trained and educated her.Exactly the same premise as My Fair Lady. Except, Billie Dawn's character NEVER exhibits the strength, independence nor intelligence of Liza Doolittle. Nor was Liza Doolittle a kept woman. At the end of Born Yesterday, Billie's learned to pronounce some words, but she's still uncouth. Her last line, to the cop is, Look it up! She's as strident and defensive as she was in the beginning -- just slightly less so.Holden's character, meanwhile, hasn't changed or grown one whit. Nor has Crawford's. Nor has anybody.Born Yesterday plays beautifully on stage. On film, subject to more intimate scrutiny, it plays funny but not real. Nobody changes, nobody grows (despite the superficial growth of Billie). There are some terrific lines, and serious themes. But it's really a showcase for the actress who plays Billie. And Judy Holliday did it better than anybody.Won Best Actress for 1950, in fact.Which brings us to the controversy.Up against Bette Davis in All About Eve and Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, should Holliday have won? Depends on what constitutes Best Actress. Several comments on IMDb suggest that Swanson was largely playing herself, and so deserved to lose. Other comments suggest the same about Bette Davis.Truth? Bette Davis WAS playing a version of herself in All About Eve, as anybody who's read much about her, or who is familiar with her films, knows. She was and always will be a Diva. Brilliant. But a Diva.Judy Holliday's range as an actress was not much. She plays but a slight variation of her Billie Dawn character in everything she ever did. Again brilliant, but one note.Swanson? Hardly. The actress was as far from Norma Desmond as you can get. As anybody knows who's seen her interviews in the Hollywood series narrated by James Mason, she had an astonishingly versatile career, from comedy to tragedy, in all sorts of roles, in silents and sound films, from the time she was 14. Swanson's real voice, in the Hollywood series or live onstage, is NOTHING like Norma Desmond's. What an actress!When her film career ended, she became a highly successful businesswoman in several fields. She NEVER looked back. She remained vital and theatrically active into her seventies (see my review of Sunset Boulevard for a recollection of seeing her onstage when she was that age).Billy Wilder (Director) always thought of Sunset Boulevard as a comedy. Indeed, he approached Mae West (among others) for the role of Norma Desmond. Remnants of that original concept still exist I AM big. It's the pictures that got small. But as for an actor going as FAR from herself and as deeply into the character, there is no comparison between Davis, Holliday and Swanson in 1950, Swanson wins hands down.Billy Wilder had to shoot Sunset Boulevard under a fictitious title (A Can of Beans) because if the actual script had leaked out, the film would never have been made. For its day, it was a shocking exposure of the pitiful underbelly of Hollywood -- failed writers turning into male gigolos, delusional former stars and all.The Academy, conservative as always, was outraged and denied Swanson the award she deserved.Today, nearly sixty years later, the American Film Institute lists Sunset Boulevard as number 12 out of the 100 greatest films ever made.Born Yesterday doesn't even appear on the list.There is no controversy.

Cukor is the problem a visitor from a distant galaxy could instantly recognize that we're supposed to already know that Judy Holliday is hilarious, that there's going to be big boffo laffs, and that she can therefore play it very, very small and, OK, here's the huge pause in the action so you've got time for the obligatory laugh. Awful.That's before we get to the content of the cruel, demeaning script. Politically incorrect? Of course, but even without that it has no compunctions about embarrassing the principals for humorous purpose. Pity, because what Judy Holliday is doing here is incredibly quirky and individual, like a young Shirley Maclaine.

I would rather turn gay and marry Steve Urkel from Family Matters than be subjected to this again.How was this a comedy. I can't think of one thing that was ever even remotely close to being funny. I can't remember anything that even played for a laugh. I must admit, I did smile once. It was nice to see Harry slap her around a bit.I think that if they had existed at the time we very likely would have seen a consensus between the Razzies and the Oscars. "}]
